 AN HISTORICAL VIEW OF THE IRISH STAGE FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD DOWN TO THE CLOSE OF THE SEASON INTERSPERSED WITH THEATRICAL ANECDOTES AND AN OCCASIONAL REVIEW OF THE IRISH DRAMATIC AUTHORS AND ACTORS IN TWO VOLUMES VOL II  BY ROBERT HITCHCOCK OF THE THEATREROYAL DUBLIN  DUBLIN Printed by WILLIAM FOLDS No Gt Strandstreet  PREFACE  BEFORE we enter upon the immediate subject matter of the present volume a few words seem necessary partly by way of explanation partly of apology  The delay which has attended the publication of it seems to suggest itself as the first subject of remark For this and indeed for most of the errors and imperfections of the work the author has but one excuse to offer the unceasing bustle and distraction of an occupation of which none but those who have experienced it can form an adequate conception It was his intention that the present volume should have immediately or at least by a very short interval followed the former But  the reason alledged has put it totally out of his power to accomplish it sooner than he has done  The same excuse he hopes will be extended to the many deficiencies under which he is conscious the work labours Several circumstances concur to render the volume now submitted to public inspection of a nature more difficult and more delicate than that of the preceding The period which it comprises coming so much nearer to the present day must of course involve events more within the recollection of many persons living and circumstances in which their personal feelings may frequently be interested In such a case should any thing chance to have been misrepresented he requests the error may be imputed to the single cause already alledged want of sufficient leisure He has endeavoured to be as accurate as possible If he has failed it has been through ignorance not intention  With respect to the persons mentioned in the following pages many of them are still living many have their surviving friends To the feelings of these several persons he hopes that nothing which is there related can give offence In speaking both of characters and events the attainment of truth has been his constant endeavour In all cases which would admit of the alternative he has even leaned to the side of praise rather than to that of censure  Another objection which may probably be raised against the present volume is that it is incomplete The original proposals for the work and even the title page itself profess to come down to the end of the year The present volume closes with the year For this deficiency the nature of the subject must be the excuse The nearer we approached to the time in which we live the greater was the number of circumstances known and necessary to be related  The endeavour of the writer has been rather to compress than to diffuse facts Yet even so the period at first marked out was found to contain more than was expected and more than would fall within the ordinary limits of a volume The reason why the year in particular has been chosen for a termination is that the season preceding had been remarkable both for its success and its excellence and that the stage of Ireland had at that time attained a distinguished degree of eminence For in the choice of a resting place it is natural to fix on that which affords the fairest prospect Whether the work shall be thought worthy of further continuance will be matter for public opinion  Such as it is the author submits the following volume to inspection He is as conscious as any person can be of its defects But he is persuaded that it will meet with every candid indulgence  CLARENDONSTREET  st MAY  CONTENTS OF THE SECOND VOLUME  CHAP I  SITUATION of the two Theatres at the end of the year    Mr Brown assumes the direction

Barry in OrestesFoote in FondlewifeReception of Admiral Saunders at the Theatre  THE detail of events with which the former volume of this work concluded has brought us to the termination of the theatrical campaign in May We have been there presented  with that variety of unexpected and of unhappy occurrences by which Mr Sheridan after the continued exertions of many successive years to sustain the dignity of the dramatic throne of this kingdom was at once compelled to resign its septre and to yield its empire to his more fortunate competitors The period therefore which has been mentioned saw Messrs Barry and Woodward in unrivalled possession exulting in the plenitude of their theatric power  Flushed with this extraordinary success and highly elate with their conquests the joint managers of Crowstreet beheld in imagination their utmost wishes accomplished and looked forward to a long series of years in which they hoped to reap the harvest which smiled to them in prospect  It might indeed have been reasonably expected that thus victorious crowned with public favour with so excellent a company as they then commanded and with such brilliant future views they had attained the summit of their desires and that opposition so completely foiled must cease her fruitless efforts and entirely leave the field to so powerful and resistless  an enemy Far different however were the consequences  The distressed and shattered remains of the Smockalley company were still to be provided for But without a leader nothing could possibly be done Various were the conferences held for the attainment of this object innumerable were the projects formed yet teeming with almost insurmountable difficulties However live they must and some measure must be adopted with speed Every eye seemed turned upon Mr Brown as their last hope Indeed his known indolence of temper and extreme inattention to business little qualified him for such a station as conductor of a Theatre but his extraordinary abilities as an actor the reputation he had so justly acquired with the town joined to his knowledge of the stage overbalanced these defects and seemed in some measure to qualify him for this peculiarly arduous task On his part his fortunes were desperate He had not any thing to lose and might if fortune smiled reap some temporary advantage  Desperate situations require desperate exertions and what at one time prudence would  condemn at others necessity justifies and sanctions No sooner therefore was this almost hopeless project formed than it was instantly embraced Almost every performer in the theatre enlisted under the banner of this new monarch and promised their utmost assistance  Mr Brown then commenced his reign by entering into treaty with Mr Sheridan for the possession of the forlorn and deserted domains of Smockalley for the ensuing winter Tho' there appeared so little prospect of success yet as there was no other resource Mr Sheridan was contented to resign to him his dominions with their every remaining appendage upon very moderate conditions  The principal object being thus accomplished it was next resolved to spend the intervening time previous to the winter season at Cork and Limerick where they might have leisure to meliorate their plan and devise the best methods of carrying it into execution Accordingly the remainder of the company except Mr Digges and Mrs Ward who returned to Edingburh in in a short time after repaired to Cork where  they continued to perform for several weeks with tolerable success  This unforeseen storm however did not discourage the Crowstreet managers the opposition wore an aspect too feeble to create a serious alarm Yet however they might despise the impotence of the attack like prudent generals they provided against the next campaign with such foresight as left very little hopes for the most sanguine friends of the opposite party Immediately on the close of the season Mr Sowdon sailed for England and was quickly followed by Mr Woodward and Mr Barry who hastened up to London where they entered into treaty with every performer of eminence whom they had any chance of engaging  Their company in the mean time repaired to their respective summer engagements which chiefly lay at Chester Manchester Liverpool and other principal tows contiguous to the Irish coasts these performers were principally Mr and Mrs Dancer Mr and Mrs Jefferson Mr and Mrs Kennedy Mr Isaac Sparks Mr Carmichael c  Mr King to the great regret of his numerous admirers in this kingdon returned to London where he made his first appearance at Drurylane Theatre in the October following in Tom in the Conscious Lovers  The new managers on their arrival in London found little difficulty in their applications The names of Barry and Woodward had great weight in their negociations success had established their characters and fame the sure attendant on victory had prepared for them a most flattering reception  The only person who could materially oppose them was Mr Mossop He had been now absent upwards of two years from Ireland his reputation on leaving that kingdom was equal to any actor's on the stage and the estimation he at present stood in with the London audience added highly to his character 'Twas no easy task to accommodate the business to his inclinations but he was too dangerous a rival to stand on punctilio with  Fortunately they found him in a mood not altogether friendly to Mr Garrick and consequently  better disposed to listen to their proposals Great and unrivalled as the Roscius was yet was he not superior to the stings of envy The rising fame of Mr Mossop appeared to have excited in him some such sensation and it was whilst under this impression that the Crowstreet managers addressed the former  In an evil hour to himself did he yield to their solicitations and they had the address quickly to settle every thing to his satisfaction He made his own terms and the parts in Tragedy were to be divided between him and Mr Barry in a very judicious manner  Thus did a little pique urge him to a step he had ever after reason to repent and plunge him into difficulties distress and poverty which ended but with his life whereas had he remained at Drurylane there could not have been a doubt but his extraordinary merit would speedily have placed him above every competitor but Mr Garrick and crowned him with the fullness both of fortune and of fame  This capital point gained they next turned their thoughts towards Mr Foote whose great fashion and popularity pointed him out as a very  proper auxiliary at the commencement of the ensuing season They engaged him for a certain number of nights during which he was to perform those pieces of his own writing then in such reputation and to bring out his Taste and Minor neither of which had ever been exhibited in Ireland  By the beginning of the following September the managers had nearly completed their recruiting business Several other engagements which the future pages will bring forward were completed and on the th of the above month Mr Woodward arrived in Dublin with expectations as sanguine and as flattering as the warmest fancy could suggest  That those expectations were founded on reason and probability will be seen by a slight review of their recommendations Their company was perhaps the strongest and best formed of any hitherto beheld in Ireland High in public favour their credit established a new theatre an excellent wardrobe they had every advantage which could be derived from a combination of circumstances so fortunate To crown these and give animation to the whole they were in  a very eminent degree possessed of every influence which the court could give Robert Wood  Esq  then master of the revels in this kingdom appointed Mr Barry and Mr Woodward his deputies by which act Crowstreet became the theatre royal Mr Wood also conferred upon them the office of directors of his Majesty's band a post indeed of more honour than profit but their principal dependance lay on the new Lord Lieutenant the Duke of Dorset He was remarkably popular and his countenance must add uncommon weight to the party he espoused In this respect they were not deceived The Duke and Duchess of Dorset were peculiarly fond of the theatre and honoured it with their presence once or twice every week during the season  Thus powerfully prepared they took the field early in the season Mr Barry remained in London to finish his business there and to wait the leisure of Mr Mossop who had agreed to accompany him on his return Mr Woodward in the mean time opened the theatre on Wednesday October d with a new occasional prologue in the character of Rumour written purposely to defeat the opposition formed against  them and spoken by Mr Woodward with great point and force The play was the Comedy of  THE WAY OF THE WORLD  Mirabel  by Mr Dexter  Fainall  Mr Sowdon  Witwood  Mr Jefferson  Petulant  Mr Whyte  Waitwell  Mr Walker  Sir Wilful Witwood  Mr Sparks  Marwood  Mrs Kennedy  Mrs Fainall  Mrs Jefferson  Lady Wishfort  Mrs Mynitt  Mincing  Mrs Younger  Millimant  Mrs Dancer  With the Farce of THE MOCK DOCTOR  Mock Doctor  Mr Sparks  Dorcas  Mrs Pye  The house was tolerably full and both pieces received with applause  But as the above bill does not by any means convey to the public a just idea of the numbers or merits of the company I shall for their further information subjoin the following list  Mr Barry  Mr Woodward  Mr Mossop  Mr Foote  Mr Dexter  Mr Sowdon  Mr Heaphy  Mr Sparks  Mr Vernon  Mr Jefferson  Mr Walker  Mr Glover  Mr R Elrington  Mr Whyte  Mr Read  Mr Mynitt  Mr Younger  Mr Fisher  Mr Fisher jun  Mr Hamilton  Mr Knipe  Mr Morris  Mr Hayes  Mr Corry  Mr Olivier  Mr Layfield  Mr Messink  Mr Aldridge  Mr Mahon  Mr Harvey  Mr Stageldoir  Mr Carmichael Prompter  Mrs Dancer  Mrs Fitzhenry  Mrs Kennedy  Miss Osborne  Mrs Knipe  Mrs Pye  Mrs Younger  Mrs Packenham  Mrs Jefferson  Miss Mason  Miss Rosco  Mrs Chambers  Mrs Walker  Miss Whyte  Mrs Mynitt  Signiora Coralina and her mother  From the above statement I am led to make the following observations though they are somewhat prematureSo heavy and numerous a company had never before been collected for Dublin the consequences were obvious the receipts of the theatre were not at that time nor indeed have they ever been since equal to the support of so enormous an expence The weekly payments to performers alone often amounted to upwards of l exclusive of tradesmens bills and servants salaries which many times were not less than l more The Theatre had not then nor perhaps ever will attain in this kingdom a degree of opulence sufficient to justify such expenditures the public cannot in reason expect it and the manager who thus launches out into such extravagance will too late feel the consequences of his imprudence The present instance justifies these reflections At the end of one of the most successful seasons ever then known Mr Barry and Mr Woodward  found themselves greatly deficient a deficiency which every year increased till in the end it involved them in total ruin  But to return Every thing seemed to wear a propitious aspect with the new Theatreroyal Crow street The town was highly pleased with the house company and the performances So many difficulties had Mr Brown to struggle with that his most zealous partizans could entertain but little hopes of his being able to open Smockalley Almost every night produced some novelty at Crowstreet and the several exhibitions were in general well attended A Signior Lucca Fabiano a dancer made his first appearance after the Beggars Opera early in the season his abilities were of the moderate kind and could not be put in competition with Mr Aldridge then beginning to be a great favourite and who in one particular stile of dancing was superior to any man in Europe  A few nights after two young ladies made their debut in the comedy of Love makes a man A Miss Rosco in the part of Narcissa and a Miss Osborne in that of Amanda and both were received with a moderate share of applause  Miss Rosco was the daughter of an actor of that name of some eminence in the theatic world This young lady had many claims on the public Her figure and features tho' full and rather masculine were well adapted to the stageshe had spirit and possessed pleasing musical powers Her forte lay principally in lively comedy and singing characters such as Lucy in the Beggars Opera She remained several years in this kingdom esteemed and respected at length being rather disgusted at the situation in which she was she resolved to try another Having received an excellent education and being mistress of many elegant accomplishments she quitted the stage and returned to Bath where she opened a boarding school for young ladies which she conducted with the highest reputation and greatest success Miss Osborne was of a respectable English family the misfortunes and death of her father obliged her mother to retire with this her only daughter to Dublin where she lived with prudence and oeconomy If fame is to be credited the same chance which gave the abilities of Mrs Oldfield to the world discovered those of Miss Osborne A gentleman of much theatrical knowledge by accident one day overheard her reading the play of Venice Preserved to her mother  struck with the propriety and elegance of her manner he a few days after mentioned this circumstance to Mr Barry who was his particular friend in so warm a manner that Mr Barry in consequence of his request visited the young lady and from a few specimens which he prevailed on her timidity to give found his friend had not exagerated in his report of her abilities The conclusion was after some intreaty he prevailed on the mother to consent to Miss Osborne's going on the stage where she remained many years and though her talents were not of the first rate yet she sustained many second parts in tragedy and comedy with reputation whilst her character in private rendered her an ornament to her profession In process of time we shall find this young lady married to Mr W Barry treasurer  To give every public sanction to the theatre the Duke and Duchess of Dorset commanded a play so early in the season as Saturday October th when the comedy of the Stratagem was performedin which Mr Woodward played Scrub Mr Dexter Archer and Mrs Dancer Mrs Sullen with the ballad farce of the Contrivances then in great estimation Rovewell  Mr Vernon and Arethusa Mrs Chambers Every preparation was made to receive these illustrious guests the house was uncommonly brilliant and crowded and so highly pleased were their Graces with their entertainment that every Saturday and sometimes oftner during the remainder of the season did they honour the theatre with their presence  Much about this time a young Gentleman was announced for the character of Lord Townly being his first appearance on any stage Curiosity prompted many to see this young adventurer who on trial acquitted himself with great credit and gave early promise of proving a powerful support to the drama His next appearance was in George Barnwell when he confirmed the favourable hopes conceived of him  The latter end of October Mr Barry arrived with Mr Mossop whose appearance was immediately advertised for Wednesday the st in his favourite character of Zanga a part in which he certainly outstript every competitor and truly merited the admiration of the dramatic world At an early hour the house was filled and the reiterated plaudits which accompanied his entrance  spoke the genuine feelings of the public at the return of one of the brightest ornaments of the Irish stage and at the same time convinced the managers that they had procured a most valuable acquisition to their community  But short are our views and erroneous too often our best concerted projects oft do we grasp with eagerness and avidity at objects which when attained prove the source of endless evils Even so was it in the present case Could Mr Barry and Mr Woodward have foreseen but a part of the consequences which flowed from their engagement of Mr Mossop or the numberless train of calamities which for a succession of years they were to experience they would have submitted to the greatest temporary loss or dissappointment rather than invite over a man who alone in a very short time was capable of disputing their title to the dramatic sovereingty of this kingdom  Mr Mossop's second character was Richard his third Macbeth in which Mrs Fitzhenry made her first appearance that season In a few days after Measure for Measure which was revived for the purpose was brought forward and most capitally supported throughout especially by Mr  Mossop in the Duke Mr Woodward in Lucio and Mrs Fitzhenry in Isabella The reputation this comedy then acquired supported it for many years and it was often repeated even after several of its principal supporters were disunited  Mr Barry judiciously reserved himself till the season was somewhat more advanced and the novelty of Mr Mossop had in some measure subsided On Saturday November th he came out with the utmost force and eclat in Orestes in the Distrest Mother Pyrrhus Mr Sowdon Andromache Mrs Dancer and Hermione Mrs Fitzhenry The play was commanded by the Lord Lieutenant The characters were new dressed No expence was spared and every circumstance concurred to render the house uncommonly fashionable and brilliant  Early in December Mr Foote was brought forward in the comedy of the Old Batchelor which was got up on purpose for his Fondlewife after which was presented his farce of the Knights Amidst such a group of capital objects Mr Foote had not much reason to boast of his attraction however his engagement answered the manager's  purpose he played upon shares and filled up the vacant nights In the course of a few weeks he appeared in Sir Paul Plyant Double Dealer Shylock besides often repeating his farces of the Knights Taste the Author and the Englishman returned from Paris His Minor from which great expectations were formed failed very much and was not repeated Its success afterwards in London gave it a currency it otherwise never would have obtained  Mr Foote's benefit was on the th of February soon after which he returned to England not much pleased with his expedition either as to fame or profit The latter did not by any means answer and he had the mortification to leave his pupil Mr Wilkinson at the other house in full possession of the town and rising every day in the very line he so much excelled in mimickry even so much as to be acknowledged at least equal if not superior to his preceptor  Much about this time the comedy of the London Cuckolds was performed with such strength as to render it popular enough to draw several houses Thank heaven the taste of the times has since undergone a material change Were such a  licentious piece to be now presented to the public they would reject it with the indignation it so highly merits  The stage should never be made the vehicle of immorality or vice its interests should ever be subservient to the cause of religion and virtue As long as this golden rule is observed so long will the drama flourish and be cherished by the wise and good  Here I cannot help observing that a just and refined taste in the public will ever have its due influence on the theatre Was that taste more universal the manager and actor from inclination and interest would more strictly conform to it neither in such a case would introduce or perform what could not stand the test of truth and reasonsuch as the audience aresuch always will be the actor  A circumstance happened about this time which deserves notice At this period the arms of Great Britain were uncommonly successful by sea and land in every quarter of the globe Amongst her victorious sons Admiral Saunders eminently distinguished himself by accident the  ship he commanded put into Cork where he landed and immediately proceeded to Dublinon his arrival in the evening he found that the Lord Lieutenant to whom he intended to pay his respects was at the play with the Duchess upon which he hastened to the theatre where he was introduced to themthe moment the audience were informed who he was they stood up and gave him three huzzas and the managers when the play was concluded sent on Mr Vernon drest in character attended by every vocal performer in the house to sing Rule Brittania so unexpected a compliment produced an effect not to be discribed Every spectator joined in chorus and the house resounded with acclamations  CHAP II  Smockalley Company delineatedMr Brown Ryder Stayley Hurst Heatton Waker Mrs Ibbot the two Miss Philips's and Mrs AbingtonThey openMr Wilkinson arriveshis successHigh life below Stairs performed with great applause  BUT all this while the reader may perhaps imagine that I have entirely forgot the Smockalley theatrenot soinnumerable were the difficulties Mr Brown and the performers under his management had to struggle withpoverty want of numbers want of credit a deserted ruinous theatre contrasted to every advantage which power success strength of forces universal favour and full coffers could confer  However all that could be done by people in such circumstances was performed Mr Brown's abilities I have formerly mentioned He had an ease a manner and address which few could ever attain His Copper Captain was allowed to be superior to Woodward'shis Benedict at least  equalMr Ryder whose merit even at this early period was universally acknowledged proved of infinite service to the cause As few ever deserved public favour more so have none enjoyed it longer than this excellent comedian Mr George Stayley an actor of some ability and noticed as an author joined the standard Mr Hurst an actor of respectability and merit Mr Heatton Mr Waker since well known to the Dublin audience Mr Johnston Mr Adcock Mr Mahon formed the principal part of the male performers  The ladies were Mrs Ibbot who though far from being a good figure was an excellent actress and a remarkably good speaker she played many characters in tragedy much above mediocrity but in Mrs Heidelberg Lady Wrangle Mrs Oakly and parts in that line she was superior to any I have ever seen The two Miss Phillips's Miss Willis Mrs Adcock Mrs Johnson c  It is somewhat remarkable that three sisters should have been equally smitten with a love for the drama and have devoted their abilities to the service of the theatre The three Miss Phillips's were of a genteel family in England and had received a finished and accomplished education  While young they went upon the stage and supported each of them a very principal and extended line of business both in tragedy and comedy for many years The eldest died unmarried at York where she had resided for some time lamented and beloved Of the other two one was married to Mr Usher the other became a Mrs Frances and what has principally distinguished her was mother to the now so celebrated Mrs Jordan  From circumstances the least expected frequently arise events the most splendid The disagreeable predicament in which Mr Brown was placed proved the means of introducing to the world talents which have since excited its constant admiration I mean no less than those of the famous Mrs Abington This lady was at that time very young We are told by Mr Wilkinson in his Memoirs that "She had played a few parts at Bath when Mr Brown was manager also at Richmond and in a few chance plays with Theophilus Cibber in the Haymarket" And though she had at every opportunity given specimens of those comic powers which were afterwards so amply displayed yet it could scarcely have been supposed that in so short a  time she would have been acknowledged the first comic actress on the stage  Mrs Abington had been at Drury Lane with Mr Garrick but judging from every appearance that at that time she could not have in London so favourable a field for the display of her abilities as Dublin presented she listened to the proposals of Mr Brown who was then in town on the recruiting service He entertained the highest opinion of her merit and promised her every leading character she could wish His offers were accepted accompanied by her husband she embarked for Ireland where she arrived early in December  Mr Brown having used every exertion possible in London returned to Dublin the latter end of November Having repaired and decorated Smock Alley as far as his slender finances would admit and made every necessary preparation he opened on Friday the th of December with the comedy of the Stratagem in which he performed Archer Mr Waker Scrub and Mrs Abington Mrs Sullen being her first appearance on the Irish stage On this occasion Mr Brown spoke a prologue written by himself  entreating the favour and protection of the town  Every effort which could be used was tried to procure a respectable audience for the first night and the curiosity generally prevalent on such occasions induced many to visit their longfavoured scene of amusement The company was altogether tolerably liked and hope animated their endeavours Their next essay was on the Wednesday following when Mr Brown appeared in his favourite Benedict which with Mrs Abington's Beatrice were as truly capital pieces of acting as ever were presented to the public  As Mr Brown was acknowledged to be equal to any comedian living in such charactersas Brass in the Confederacy Bayes in the Rehearsal Ranger in the Suspicious Husband Sir John Brute Felix Roebuck Marplot Dr Wolf in the Non Juror Don John in the Chances Monsieur Le Medecin Lord Chalkstone Aspin Abel Drugger so did Mrs Abington surpass the most sanguine expectations in Corinna Clarinda Flora and Violante Lady Fanciful Leanthe Maria in the Non Juror Second Constantia Fine Lady in Lethe c Each night she appeared  she added to her reputation and before the season closed notwithstanding every disadvantage and many there were particularly that of not having received the London stamp of fashion and approbation she was considered as one of the first and most promising actresses on the stage  To this embarrassed state of the Smock Alley company fortune raised an unexpected relief This was the arrival of Mr Wilkinson in Ireland and his almost immediate engagement with Mr Brown This gentleman in his memoirs which contain an infinite deal of dramatic information and are well worthy the perusal of every lover of the Theatre relates the incidents of this campaign with so much accuracy and fidelity that he has left little for me to say  I shall only therefore observe that Mr Wilkinson was a very seasonable and necessary reinforcement He had great connections in Dublin and general opinion gave him the preference to Mr Foote His terms were shares above twenty pounds and a clear benefit The former proved of little emolument the latter highly productive He appeared on Friday January th  after the comedy of Much ado about Nothing in a piece of Mr Foote's never at that time acted in Ireland called the Diversions of the Morning He was well supported and received much applause His imitation of his late friend Mr Foote was highly relished and he repeated it on the Monday following after Browne's Shylock and Mrs Abington's Portia to about forty pounds  Mr Wilkinson during his stay repeatedly acted King Lear Zampti in the Orphan of China Mrs Amlet in the Confederacy Lord Chalkstone and Cadwallader Mrs Abington Becky His benefit was fixed for Friday February th Douglas and for the first time in this kingdom the farce of High Life below Stairs when notwithstanding a very deep snow storm Measure for Measure performed at Crow Street with Mossop Woodward and Fitzhenry with the pantomime of Fortunatus which drew one hundred and twenty pounds and a concert for the benefit of a Miss M'Neale yet so great was his interest there was an overflow from every part and the amount of the receipts was one hundred and seventytwo pounds the greatest then said to have been ever known in that Theatre A second night was demanded for his outstanding  tickets and on Thursday February st to the Orphan of China and High Life there was one hundred and fifty pounds Mr Wilkinson returned to London early in March much satisfied with his expedition  And here I must notice the extraordinary success of the farce of High Life below Stairs It would exceed the limits prescribed to this work to copy at full length the circumstances attending this piece which Mr Wilkinson so agreeably describes suffice it to say that this pleasing farce had escaped the notice of the Crow Street managers In the multiplicity of their business engrossed as they were in the preparation of grand tragedies and pantomimes they probably might not have thought it worthy of their attention Mr Wilkinson luckily fixed upon it He communicated his intentions to Mrs Abington who not only approved of his choice but consented to play the part of Kitty The piece had been brought out at Drury Lane so early as the month of October where it had met with the greatest success They had both frequently seen it before they left London and were therefore quite perfect in the stage business proper to it It lay within the compass of the company could be  got up at very little expence and no comparison could be drawn to their disadvantage  Mr Wilkinson tells us  Mr Ryder's Sir Harry was a very excellent piece of acting and helped the piece materially A Mr Gates a very conceited actor played Lord Duke His faults and oddities served but to heighten the extravagance of the character Mr Heatton's Philip was as well as such a part could be He was a very good actor in all the dry clowns Clodpoles c Miss Philips aunt to the present Mrs Jordan our heroine who was also of a conceitedturn though sensible and well educated made the part of Lady Bab better than any other actress I ever saw attempt it myself from observation and youth must have been stupid not to have made a very good Jemmy the Country Boy and as the great personage always appears last in triumphal entries and processions so in Mrs Kitty Mrs Abington advanced The whole circle were in surprise and rapture each asking the other how such a treasure could have possibly been in Dublin and almost in a state of obscurity such a jewel was invaluable and their own tastes and judgments they feared would justly be called in question if this daughter of Thalia was not  immediately taken by the hand and distinguished as her certain and striking merit demanded  To this I shall only add that so successful were they in their representation of this farce that it was repeated upwards of a dozen times during the remaining part of the season  Little more remains to be said of the Smock Alley company for the present Notwithstanding the great merit of the several performers I have mentioned yet the contest was too unequal to be maintained with any degree of probable success Mr Brown varied the bill of fare as much as possible He appeared alternately in Benedict Richard Captain Macheath Copper Captain Old Norval Roman Father c Though he displayed much merit in each and was in several aided by the rising favourite Mrs Abington though Mr Ryder was allowed to be a promising and favourite actor though Mr Hurst Mr Heatton Mr Stayley Miss Philips Mrs Ibbot and several others had distinguished themselves yet still all was ineffectual The receipts in common were from  l  to  l  many had good benefits particularly Mrs Abington who had got up the play of A New Way to Pay  Old Debts and who grew then so much the fashion that her house was crowded and brilliant  Mr Brown at length closed a disagreeable campaign early in May heartily tired of his situation his finances certainly could not be much more deranged than they were at the commencement for he had nothing to lose at the beginning it is true there was an accumulation of debts which perhaps have never since been discharged and the rest of the performers must have suffered materially in their circumstances  I shall close for the present my account of the Smock Alley Theatre with the following bill of one of their best and most attracting comedies which may afford some insight into the state of their performances  By Permission of the Right

Gallery  s    d  Printed by Augustus Long in Essexstreet  Let us now return to the victorious party Hitherto each event had answered to their utmost wish the theatre was in the highest request and well attended Indeed in justice to the managers it must be observed that they were truly deserving of public favour They spared neither pains nor expence in preparing their pieces for representation on the contrary their profusion was their only fault They launched into expences which the receipts of a Dublin theatre have hitherto never been able to repay expences which in the end must even with the greatest success involve every manager who adopts them in inevitable ruin  The tragedies of Crowstreet were got up in a stile of superior splendour The expence of the mere guards in Coriolanus amounted to  l    s  per night The guards and chorus singers in Alexander to  l  The acting of the tragedies was first rate The force of the Two Heroes of the Buskin was aided by the powerful attractions of Mrs Dancer and Mrs Fitzhenry A specimen or two will shew the strength of their representations as Othello Mr Barry Roderigo Mr Woodward Cassio Mr Dexter Brabantio Mr Walker Iago Mr  Mossop Desdemona Mrs Dancer and Emelia Mrs Fitzhenry Venice Preserved Pierre Mr Mossop Jaffier Mr Barry Belvidera Mrs Dancer In Jane Shore Hastings Barry Dumont Mossop Jane Shore Dancer Alicia Fitzhenry All for Love Antony Barry Dolabella Dexter Ventidius Mossop Octavia Dancer Cleopatra Fitzhenry These with Mr Woodward's excellent pantomimes where neither pains or expence were spared were deserving of every favour and encouragement  There never were perhaps two tragedians of such uncommon excellence whose abilities so well accorded and whose respective lines of acting so little interfered as those of Barry and of Mossop Nature had indeed been peculiarly bountiful to both and had gifted them with a liberal hand But in the distribution of her favours she would appear to have promoted union by diversity The talents of each though great were so distinct their qualifications so opposed as to preclude the probability of disputes arising from immediate competition Their performances formed an almost total contrast the one to the other hence it would be natural to imagine that those theatrical demons  envy and discord should have been for ever excluded from their intercourse Happy would it have been for themselves happy for a numerous lift of performers who were afterwards attached to their fortunes if such had been the case Truth obliges me to confess it was the very reverse The real motives which originated the coolness between Mr Barry and Mr Mossop I am not able at this distance of time to ascertain but the effects were visible  The fame of Mrs Abington still increasing she became an object for the Crowstreet managers to fix their attention upon many persons of the first rank earnestly interested themselves in her favour and wished much to see their new favourite transplanted to the genial sunshine of the royal theatre before the close of the present season and they exerted themselves so strenuously that an engagement was soon concluded She was to perform a few nights for a clear benefit  The first appearance of Mrs Abington at Crowstreet theatre was on the d of May in the character of lady Townly and  Lucinda in the Englishman in Paris being the night appointed for her benefit and so generally was she patronized that part of the pit was laid into the boxes and there was a great overflow from every part of the house So rapidly did this charming actress rise and so highly was she esteemed by the public even so early did she discover a taste in dress and a talent to lead the ton that several of the ladies most fashionable ornaments were distinguished by her name and the Abington cap was the prevailing rage of the day  As the season advanced it began to be rumoured that a new and more vigorous opposition was intended This at first was disregarded as an idle report but every day added to its certainty The latter end of April put it past all doubt On the managers réquesting Mr Mossop to renew his articles he frankly replied he designed to open Smockalley theatre the ensuing winter This unforeseen stroke they were not of course prepared to encounter They had now a new and much more powerful rival to contend with their visionary hopes of having overcome all obstacles were by this declaration at an end and they had their work to begin anew However  remonstrances were fruitless Mr Mossop was offered terms even beyond their utmost ability to fulfil These he haughtily rejected Nothing therefore but uncommon exertions could guard against so formidable an attack and they now saw in its fullest extent their error in bringing over so great and dangerous a favourite  Every strength being thus required a very eligible engagement was offered by them to Mrs Abington which she thought it proper to accept rightly judging that her abilities would receive greater support and have better opportunities of display with Woodward than with Mossop It was indeed no easy task to adjust the distribution of characters between her and Mrs Dancer who then was eminent as well in comedy as in tragedy However it was agreed as nearly as possible to divide them with impartiality  On Monday June the th the Crowstreet theatre closed one of the most brilliant and successful seasons ever known in Ireland with the tragedy of Oroonoko Oroonoko Mr Barry Imoinda Mrs Dancer and the Virgin Unmasked of Mr Abington Mr Woodward immediately  afterwards set off for London to endeavour to repair his losses and provide for the next campaign He was followed in a few weeks by Mr Mossop on similar business  Mr Barry in the mean time led his conquering troops to Cork where a new and beautiful theatre had been built in George'sstreet on the model of Crowstreet capable of containing an hundred and fifty pounds  It may here not be amiss to mention that as this work is designed as an history of the Irish stage I hope it will not be deemed deviating from the general plan to devote occasionally a few pages to the dramatic occurrences of the second city in the kingdom  Cork has from the earliest accounts been used to have theatrical performances exhibited in a degree of perfection that has rendered the audience remarkably good judges The reason is evident The theatre was seldom opened but in summer when the best of the Dublin company used to be selected with the addition of some of the most capital performers from  London Before there never had been a regular theatre built  In that year they opened one tolerably commodious where the present Bush Tavern stands in George'sstreet  As Barry and Woodward had formed the most extensive designs so opulent a city as Cork could not escape their notice They purchased a piece of ground in George'sstreet and opened a subscription of fifty pounds each for building a new theatre The subscription soon filled as the subscribers were each entitled to transferable tickets of admittance to every performance without exception The theatre opened with an occasional prologue in July The company was perhaps the best ever then seen in the city the natural consequence was that the success was equal to the excellence of the performers and there was a continuation of the fullest houses ever known What in some measure contributed to this was the war which at that time brought numbers of his majesty's ships of war to Cove Sailors have always been remarked as fond of a theatre and as they earn their money harder than any other description of people in the  world so do they spend it more freely A miserly seaman is a prodigy  There happened however an event at the opening of the Cork theatre at this time worthy of noticeing The mayor of Cork had always been accustomed when the company came to town to be waited on by the manager for his permission to perform This though a mere ceremony as leave never was refused Mr Barry did not chuse to comply with The mayor willing to preserve the etiquette declared he would not grant his licence Mr Barry informed him he did not stand in need of his protection as he could open his theatre without The matter growing serious friends interposed and Mr Barry to put an end to it produced the king's patent granting to Mr Wood and his deputies the office of master of the revels in the kingdom of Ireland with liberty to open one or more theatres in Dublin or any other place they should choose After this he shewed the deputation granted to Mr Woodward and himself and to further satisfy the Mayor he laid copies of both before the city council who acknowledged their validity and the Mayor forbore any further opposition  Mr Woodward remained but a short time in London and having in the best manner possible settled his affairs then set off for Cork where the company remained 'till the latter end of September when each party prepared to take the field  CHAP III  Remarks on Theatrical oppositionsCrowstreet opens    th October    Woodward's Prologue Death of King George the    d and delay to the

appearance  WHETHER the interests of the dramatic world and of the public in general are best served by a single Theatre or by a plurality has been matter of frequent dispute As on every speculative point so on this advocates are to be found for each side of the question Nor are arguments respectively wanting  By some it is said that the exclusive establishment of a single Theatre under proper regulations is sufficient to secure the entertainment of the public whilst it precludes the distraction and distress naturally incident to contending parties Others on the contrary declaim against it as against all monopolies as partial and unjust as fettering the will of the people and depriving them of that freedom of choice which is their natural right  Without entering into the merits of this question a matter foreign to the purpose of this work let it suffice to state facts as they have been Thus much has been extracted by a contemplation of the opposition upon the history of which we are now entering It will exhibit to us as in the case of all parties many mischiefs and many excesses  As the period for the commencement of operations approached all was expectation Various were the reports in circulation and curiosity was eager for an examination and comparison of the two companies Mr Mossop returned at the latter end of September Smockalley underwent a thorough repair which indeed it  essentially wanted An entirely new set of scenes were painted by Edwards and a tolerable new wardrobe was collected  Crowstreet Theatre was also new painted and decorated and every thing being prepared they took the lead and opened on Friday October th with a new occasional prologue written and spoken by Mr Woodward who with great spirit affected to make light of the difficulties they had to encounter Repeating those lines of Hotspur's  Harry to Harry shall and horse to horse  Meet and n'eer part 'till one drop down of course  The first night at Crowstreet produced no novelty it was purposely chosen for its title All's Well that End's Well Captain Parolles Mr Woodward Helena Mrs Dancer with the Lying Valet The house was far from being crowded on this occasion no judgment could be formed  Mr Mossop had now to all appearance a fair claim to success With much diligence he had collected a very excellent company He  was universally admired as an actor and had a powerful interest amongst persons of rank The Countess of Brandon and many leading ladies were much attached to his cause he had independant of his own great merit every charm which novelty of management and performers could give The comedy of the Old Batchelor was the play fixed on and advertised when behold on the very morning announced for his opening a solemn and unforeseen event put an entire stop to his career for the present and overcast by its gloom the immediate brightness of his prospects  On Wednesday morning October th news arrived of the decease of his majesty King George the second This melancholy circumstance caused the theatre to be immediately shut it was a severe stroke to both parties but particularly unlucky to the new levies of Smockalley who could not be supposed to be overburthened with cash to sustain this additional delay In this situation patience was their only remedy Fortunately the goodness and consideration of government displayed itself on this occasion It shortened by much the usual time of mourning assured that the grief implanted in the  heart of every subject needed not this outward display of sorrow  As soon as the limited time expired both parties commenced their operations with redoubled vigour Crowstreet which continued to be the royal theatre opened with the Busy Body on Monday th November Marplot Woodward Miranda Dancer and Intriguing Chambermaid in neither of which any new Faces appeared Smockalley resumed the Old Batchelor when that genuine son of comic humour Weston made his first appearance in the character of Fondlewife and was received with much and deserved applause This actor whose naiveté and peculiar stile of playing has not since been surpassed remained in Dublin the whole of the season and though he had not then attained the eminence which afterwards he so justly acquired yet he was received with great pleasure in the Lying Valet Cymon in Damon and Phillida Old Man in Lethe Daniel in the Conscious Lovers Clown in Measure for Measure Old Woman in Rule a Wife and parts in that stile Besides Weston the first night presented Mr Sowdon in Heartwell and Mr  Sparks in Noll Bluff both these gentlemen had changed sides and a Miss Kennedy in Letitia  The next night brought forward Mr Griffith a comedian of eminence in the dramatic world who had been for some years a principal support of the Bath theatre This gentleman was a native of Dublin son of Mr Griffith mentioned with much respect in the former part of this work he had received a liberal and extended education had in the early part of his life a genteel employment in the Custom House and was brother to the celebrated Mrs Griffith an authoress of great repute and whose share in the letters of Henry and Frances had raised her reputation high in the literary world  This gentleman possessed many abilities for the stage His person was small but uncommonly elegant and well made He was easy sprightly and fashionable had a marking eye a pleasing countenance and a good voice he perfectly understood his author and had great judgment With these requisites he supported the highest characters in comedy with eclat He had much of the gentleman in his manner  and was beloved and esteemed in private for his many amiable and engaging qualities  Ranger was the part he chose to make his debut in which he supported with great applause and by desire repeated it a few nights after The public afterwards saw him with great pleasure in Sir Harry Wildair Jack Stoeks in the ballad farce of the Lottery got up on purpose Archer Captain Brazen Lord Chalkstone and the Fine Gentleman in Lethe Mercutio Lothario the Man of Taste Younger Would be and a variety of other characters in the same line  Two new Polly's made their appearance at the two Theatres much about this time At Crowstreet a Miss Bridges with the Macheath of Mr Vernon and the Lucy of Mrs Abington then esteemed the best on the stage and a Miss Greene at Smockalley where Mr Brown gained much applause in this then popular hero Peachum Mr Sparks Lucy Miss Rosco The opera was pushed a few nights and obliged to give way to other pieces of more consequence  Though the town was much divided in its opinion concerning the merits of the respective companies yet upon a critical examination the ballance seemed inclined towards Mr Mossop several of the most respectable of the Crowstreet performers had enlisted under his banners as Mr Sowdon Mr Heaphy Mr Sparks Miss Mason Mr Corry Miss Rosco Mr Aldridge Miss Coralina to these he added a variety of other engagements which threw great weight into his scale Mr Griffith Miss Kennedy and Miss Greene I have already mentioned  In point of real merit and public estimation Mr Digges certainly stood next to Mr Mossop and Mr Barry With some difficulty he was prevailed upon to return from Edinburgh where he was an extraordinary favourite and join once more the fortunes of Smock Alley His name and abilities on this occasion were a tower of strength and amply counterbalanced any advantages on the other side  But the new managers greatest expectations rested on Mrs Bellamy from Covent Garden he had entertained hopes of Mrs Fitzhenry but they were disappointed Upon mature deliberation  she preferred the certain situation she then held to the unstable prospects which the views of the other house afforded Mrs Bellamy was then in the very zenith of her reputation and without her assistance Mr Mossop could not have played a single tragedy with any probability of success Necessity therefore obliged him to yield to her terms and he agreed to give her a thousand guineas besides two benefits for the season A very capital sum for a manager to risque in those days  An English young gentleman of the name of Shaw who had never yet appeared on any stage was also engaged He was remarkably tall and thin but well made and tolerably easy from youth figure and manner he supported a respectable line in tragedy and comedy  The principal novelty of the Crowstreet managers was Mr Fleetwood from Drury Lane a very pleasing and promising actor but independant of him they had undoubtedly great strength in every line of the drama not only in tragedy and comedy but also in musical pieces and pantomime  The merits of Mr Barry and Mr Woodward were at this time too well established to need enlarging on Mrs Dancer at this period stood high in general estimation Every day justly added to her fame Nature certainly had been uncommonly bountiful and gifted her with requisites that fell to the lot of very few actresses Happily for the drama Mr Barry who was one of the best teachers in the world had every inclination and opportunity to bring those ripening abilities to maturity abilities I shall with pleasure endeavour to descant on at a future opportunity  Mrs Fitzhenry was also most deservedly esteemed the first actress in her line Admired on the stage beloved for her respectable character in private Mrs Abington's comic powers I have before noticed they excited universal applause She was already much the fashion and contributed highly to the success of the pieces she performed  But that the reader may form a just idea of the two companies I shall group them together and leave his own judgment to form a conclusion concerning their merits only just premising  that Mr Brown had with a good grace resigned the reins of government and returned to the ranks where he was of great service that Mr Ryder led a select and well formed company into the interior parts of Ireland where he continued several years with character reputation and success annually visiting the towns of Kilkenny Wexford Galway and several others and that Mrs Ibbot the two Miss Philips's with several of less note

have occasioned What a tax on amusement to support upwards of sixty actors and actresses who with their unavoidable appendages of servants dressers hairdressers c when united with the bands must have amounted on the lowest calculation to upwards of two hundred persons The very weekly salaries of the performers only at Crowstreet often amounted to one hundred and fifty pounds sometimes more besides tradesmens bills and other inevitable disbursements without the least allowance for themselves as actors or managers So enormous an expence the receipts of a London theatre at that time could but barely sustain no wonder therefore that our managers were obliged in a little time to give way to such a pressure and though possessed of the greatest rectitude of principle be unable to satisfy their creditors  But to proceed Mr Woodward's prologue of "Harry to Harry shall and Horse to Horse" was strictly exemplified on every opportunity during the season Intimation having been received that Mr Mossop Mr Digges and Mrs Bellamy were to make their first appearance in Pierre Jaffier and Belvidera the Crowstreet managers on the same evening announced Mr Barry in Pierre Mr Fleetwood in Jaffier his entrè on the stage in this kingdom and Mrs Dancer in Belvidera with the first time of the new Pantomime of Queen Mab Harlequin by Woodward Columbine Abington  Curiosity and interest operated powerfully on this occasion in favour of Smock Alley There was a crowded and fashionable house Mr Digges on opening the play was received with the warmest and most unfeigned plaudits Mr Mossop's entrance was marked with three rounds of applause as lasting as it was sincere Mrs Bellamy also in her turn received the most flattering marks of approbation  The two first in the course of the play supported their characters with a truth and energy which justly entitled them to every praise Mrs  Bellamy on the contrary sunk in the opinion of her auditors Many years had elapsed since she left Ireland Time is seldom an improvement of a lady's charms The roses and lillies in her countenance had fled and left a decay too evident The sweet tones of her voice had altered to a harshness which not being expected produced the most unpleasing sensations  The attendance at Crowstreet the same evening was not quite so crowded But the applause was at least equal and in many points more deserving If I might hazard an opinion on the respective merits of each performance I should give the preference if any to Smock Alley  In the character of Pierre Mr Mossop was most deservedly superior It was according to the best judges as fine and characteristic a piece of acting as ever was exhibited His voice manner and judgment were undescribable  Mr Barry possessed of every requisite which the most luxuriant fancy could suggest for the support of Jaffier wanted many of the essentials for Pierre With a form faultless and a voice  modulated to the most perfect harmony he did not possess the roughness of manners nor the austerity of demeanour necessary for the latter character That grace and those tones which in the expression of every softer passion were of irresistible fascination but ill depicted the sternness of the soldier meditating dark and dangerous conspiracies  Mr Fleetwood pleased much in Jaffier his figure was rather interesting his voice and manner such as are well calculated to gain an interest with the audience but in each of these he could by no means stand in competition with Mr Digges who next to Mr Barry claimed the precedence in such characters over every other competitor  Between the ladies the advantage was evidently in favour of Mrs Dancer Her talents were then improving rapidly Mrs Bellamy's as rapidly declining The first gave every night incontrovertible specimens that she would one day be the first actress of the age the latter gradually sunk into oblivion wretchedness and poverty Mrs Dancer's Belvidera I believe was equal to that of Mrs Cibber  Venice Preserved was repeated at each house but with no great effect The remainder of the season proved a continued disagreeable scene of exertions and rivalship productive of infinite trouble great expence and vexation attended with loss of reputation and very little profit and gradually involving the managers of each house in that ruin which finally overtook both  For the readers information and amusement I shall select a few instances of the above It seemed to be laid down as a rule by the respective managers that no sooner was a piece announced to be in rehearsal or for exhibition by the one than the other strained every nerve no matter with what propriety to prepossess the public with an idea of its being preparing in a superior style by him or boldly advertizing the very piece on the very same evening sometimes without an idea of its being performed but merely to divide or suspend the general curiosity  Thus the little ballad farce of the Lottery which from the limited number of afterpieces more than its intrinsic merit was then much in  fashion was no sooner exhibited at Smockalley than the week following presented it to the public at Crowstreet supported by the Jack Stocks of Mr Griffith and the admirable Chloe of Mrs Abington  The Wife's Resentment revived at the theatre royal with Mr Woodward Mrs Dancer and Mrs Abington immediately produced an advertisement announcing the same play with Mr Mossop though he had not the least idea of exhibiting it Mr Colman's farce of Polly Honeycombe then performing with eclat at Drurylane was in like manner advertised by both parties but only produced at Crowstreet on which occasion Mrs Abington acquired infinite credit in the part of Polly  The girlish characters I sincerely think she then played superior to any actress ever remembered and from her naiveté and genuine traits of nature the girls of the present actresses are copied  But the greatest piece of generalship manifested through the whole of this doubtful contest was respecting the new tragedy of The Orphan  of China written by Arthur Murphy  Esq  and at that time exhibiting with uncommon reputation in London The great fame and popularity of this piece rendered it an object of peculiar attention to both houses in Dublin but to attain their object they pursued quite different lines of conduct  The play being printed was consequently in possession of both Mr Mossop observed a profound silence on the subject and kept his designs as much a secret as possible The managers of Crowstreet on the contrary confident of their strength but rather injudiciously I should think for several weeks made a great parade of their intentions of producing it with a pomp and magnificence equal to that of Drurylane informing the public of the extraordinary expence they were at in having all the dresses made in London from models imported from China and an entire new set of scenes painted for the occasion in the true Chinese stile by the celebrated carver then deservedly in the highest reputation  When the expectations of the town were raised to the utmost pitch and curiosity strained  to the highest point without the least previous hint dropped most unexpectedly early on Monday morning January th bills were posted up announcing the representation of this much talked of tragedy that very evening at Smockalley theatre  The scenery dresses and decorations entirely new  with this specious and popular addition  The characters will be all new dressed in the manufactures of this kingdom  The truth was they had bespoke dresses to be made in London on the models of the Drurylane habits but had not the least expectation of their arriving in time As they knew that every thing depended on their producing it before the other house certain they had not an equal chance on equal terms the dresses and scenery of Crowstreet being so much superior they used every exertion possible The tragedy was rehearsed three times a day and Mr Tracey then tailor to the theatre working day and night on the dresses they were completed in eight and forty hours  The event proved that they acted right The Orphan of China drew five tolerable houses to Smockalley before they were able to get it out  at Crowstreet and then it did not answer the expence they had been at The dresses and scenery were truly characteristic but the curiosity of the public had been in a great measure previously gratified  The following is the manner of its being performed at both houses     CrowStreet  SmockAlley  Zampti  Mr Barry  Mr Mossop

Fitzhenry  Mrs Bellamy  The Tempest revived at this time displayed another scene of contention In this case both companies started fairly and brought it out on the same night with if I can judge pretty nearly equal success They continued playing it till both lost money by it  In point of performance Mr Mossop had the advantage as may be seen by the following view     CrowStreet  SmockAlley  Prospero  Mr Fleetwood  Mr Mossop  Stephano  Mr Woodward  Mr Brown  Alonzo  Mr Adcock  Mr Sowdon  Sebastian  Mr Knipe  Mr Heaphy  Antonio  Mr Morris  Mr Heatton  Gonzalez  Mr Mynitt  Mr Digges  Trinculo  Mr  Mr Griffith  Caliban  Mr Glover  Mr Sparks  Ariel  Mrs Glover  Miss Young  Miranda     Miss Macartney  With respect to scenery machinery and decorations Crowstreet certainly was superior Carver was then one of the first scene painters in Europe Mr Messink the first machinist ever known in this kingdom and Finny their carpenter had infinite merit  The greatest advantage the Crowstreet managers obtained over their rivals was with their pantomimes which they exhibited on the most extensive and finished scale and in which the Harlequin of Mr Woodward was decidedly the greatest on the stage  This season Queen Mab and the Sorcerer were brought out at an enormous expence and performed many nights yet notwithstanding they were exhibited in a style of perfection worthy the first theatre in Europe and were universally admired they by no means repaid the enormous expences attending their representation and it is my opinion that the manager who ventures a large sum of money on this species of entertainment in Dublin runs a very great risk of not being reimbursed  In London the case is totally different and the sums laid out on proper objects are sure to return with tenfold interest  Against the pantomimes Mr Mossop judiciciously revived Henry the th and got up a representation of the coronation which on account of his present majesty's accession to the throne was well timed and brought money It made a great bill excited curiosity and though the dresses were not very splendid nor numerous yet they answered the purpose and the play drew several houses  I cannot in this place avoid noticing a circumstance which ought to serve as a lesson to every performer in future  The farce of High Life was then in great reputation at both houses One night Mr Stayley of Smockalley theatre in one of the characters gave the toast of  "his majesty king George the second God rest his bones"  This very extraordinary toast though it might be said to express nothing disloyal yet was certainly highly improper and a liberty which ought not to be taken on any stage Several of the audience highly resented it and Mr Mossop with great propriety publickly reprimanded him for it Mr Stayley endeavoured to justify himself words ensued and in the conclusion he was dismissed the theatre  He then appealed to the public but with little success and as he had before created himself many enemies by his writing and mimickry he was pitied by few blamed by most and never after regained his situation  This occurrence leads me to remark the very great impropriety of any performer taking such liberties with an audience They certainly should introduce no joke or matter not strictly consonant to their author and with which the manager was not acquainted He is in every case responsible to the public for what is said and done on his stage Audiences are as variable in their dispositions as the individuals who compose them It is dangerous to sport with their passions and the manager who has so much at stake ought to be made acquainted with every innovation however trifling He alone ought to judge of their propriety as he alone must be answerable for the consequences  The occurrences of the remaining part of the season worth mentioning are but few Mr Murphy's excellent comedy The Way to Keep Him in five acts was first performed in this kingdom at Crowstreet in February where Mrs Abington added much to her reputation by the easy elegant finished portrait of the woman of fashion which she exhibited in the widow Belmour Mrs Bellamy played Cleone with some applause at Smockalley  Mr Colman's new comedy of the Jealous Wife was then bringing crowded houses at Drurylane It's extraordinary merit as it certainly ranks amongst the first comedies in the English language and the success attending its representation induced Mr Mossop to present it to the public late in the month of May supported in the following manner  Oakly  Mr Brown  Captain Cutter  Mr Sparks  Lord Trinket  Mr Kniveton  Sir Harry Beagle  Mr Shaw  Charles  Mr Usher  Tom  Mr Ellard  Major Oakly  Mr Dawson  Lady Freelove  Mrs Kennedy  Harriet  Miss Usher  Mrs Oakly  Mrs Bellamy  Mr Mossop towards the close of the campaign when the town was nearly tired opened a subscription for five revived plays Don Sebastian The Ambitious StepMother Timon of Athens Tamerlane and Richard these though forced and thinly attended carried him through and he finished with the last  mentioned play June th when he returned thanks to the public for the great patronage and support he had experienced  In the mean time Mr Woodward took another trip to London from whence he returned with Mr Shuter  This popular comedian had never been in Ireland before consequently was an object of importance He played the Miser and School Boy on the d of June with much applause His next appearance was for his own benefit the th of June following Don Lewis in Love makes a Man Clodio Mr Woodward

Mossop Digges and WoodwardTheir respective meritsThe several characters in which they excelledRespectability of the Irish stage  THE eminence of the Irish stage at the period to which we are now arrived and the very great ability with which several of it's principal departments were filled seem to point out this as a proper place to pause and take a slight review of some of its principal supporters  Messrs Barry Mossop Digges and Woodward were then in the zenith of their course an impartial though imperfect sketch of their respective merits may therefore be best attempted here  The character of Mr Barry has been already touched upon in the first volume of this work  In addition to that I hope the following remarks which I have with little alteration copied from a gentleman who had every opportunity of forming a just judgment of his abilities will not prove unacceptable  There never was perhaps an actor who altogether was so much indebted to nature as Barry As far as figure will warrant the expression he was certainly the finished portrait of man His person was noble and commanding his action graceful and correct his features regular expressive and rather handsome his countenance naturally open placid and benevolent yet easily wrought to the indications of haughtiness and contempt but in the softer expressions of the tender and feeling emotions he principally excelled  His voice was finely calculated to aid his appearance It had melody depth and strength there was a burst of grief in it which was peculiar to himself In the last act of Essex where the officers were preparing his departure and where he pointed to his wife lying on the ground with  Oh look there  His manner of expression was so forcible and affecting that the whole house always burst into tears He saw the effect and often used the cause sometimes rather improperly In expressing the blended passions of love tenderness and grief Barry stood unrivalled  With such abilities it would be difficult to point out which character was his masterpiece But it is generally given to his Othello It was a performance which could not be transcended His address to the senate was superior to that of any man who even spoke it His various transitions in the jealous scenes of that character were beautiful beyond description  The vanquisher of Asia never appeared to more advantage in representation than in the person of Barry he looked moved and acted the hero and lover in a manner that charmed every audience that saw him he gave new life and vigour to a play which had lain neglected since the death of Delane  His Marc Antony had innumerable beauties Indeed his very appearance in this magnificent  Roman who lost the world for love in the young conquering Macedonian hero and in every other character in that line was equal to what the most romantic imagination could paint  The limits of this work will not permit me to follow him through the various beauties of his numerous characters Suffice it to say that those who were so happy as to see him in the above or in the course of years in Varanes Macbeth Jaffier Osmyn Orestes Horatio Hastings Romeo Oroonoko Castalio Hotspur Lear Lord Townly Young Bevil c universally concurred in the opinion that as they had never seen his equal so would it be ages perhaps before another Barry would arise  With very opposite powers yet with such dramatic abilities as fall to the lot of very few Mr Mossop next claims our attention Never was there a greater contrast than between these heroes never were two performers better calculated by nature to shine together to reflect lustre on each others performances and support the opposite characters in tragedy  I may not perhaps be seconded in my opinion but I cannot help considering Mr Mossop not only as an original but as a singular actor nor do I recollect in the long list of capital performers who preceded him or whom we have since seen one to whom he could strictly be compared  Mr Mossop possessed an agreeable person he was of the middle size well made his action at this time much improved and with great propriety suited to the situation of the scene his countenance uncommonly marking and expressive his eye piercing and big with what his mind contained  But what eminently distinguished him from all his cotemporaries was the excellence of his voice It had a peculiarity of tone equally distinguishing as Mr Barry's though in every respect opposite it was perhaps as fine full toned articulate and solemnly impressive as any actor's that ever trod the stage possessed of unusual compass it was admirably adapted by its cadences to display the great the grand and the sublime in tragedy it conveyed equally distinct the loudest effusions of rage which the  warmth of passion required and the most solemn sentiments of the deepest declamation  There were I believe many instances where he more forcibly imprest his auditors by the energy spirit and fire of his tones than they ever experienced from any other performer In the great and terrible he rose beyond idea There were many passages of his Zanga Coriolanus Bajazet Virginius and Richard which astonished and were superior to the boldest conception before formed of those characters  Mr Mossop had also received a classical education in Trinity College He possessed much judgment and in general did uncommon justice to his author  To the parts above mentioned I may add his Duke in Measure for Measure which was truly a capital piece of acting his King John Ventidius Chamont Zampti Achmet in Barbarossa Cato Macbeth Hotspur Osman in Zara Horatio Shore Wolsey Iago Prospero and many others  Such were the tragic actors Ireland then with honest pride could boast I am afraid "we ne'er shall look upon their like again" Since their days tragedy has rapidly declined in public estimation nor is there at present any immediate prospect of its reestablishment  I am well aware that those characters as above delineated differ in several essentials from the accounts of Mr Davies and the multitude of English critics who as they do not allow them that extraordinary merit which I have ascribed so neither do they spare charging them with glaring faults which take much from their superior excellence  In reply I can say that those criticisms were formed in very unfavourable circumstances without the opportunities of beholding them in their several capital characters from whence a proper criterion could be formed My portraits are drawn from a time when they were in the meridian of life when their powers had arrived at maturity and the judgment had acquired i  rightful sovereignty over the passions Th  decided sense of this kingdom for many years warrants my assertions and at present thousands  are living witnesses of the truth of my observations  It remains next to speak of Mr Digges This gentleman then certainly stood next in merit and reputation to these justly admired performers Few men ever gave their auditors so happy an idea of the easy finished gentleman and man of fashion as Mr Digges The elegance of his figure and deportment the ease and propriety of his action with the justness of his conceptions and delivery most deservedly gained him numerous admirers  He had it must be acknowledged a few peculiarities which made some at first view stile him a mannerist But an intimate acquaintance with his mode removed those impressions and established his abilities on the firmest basis  During the course of the winter Mr Digges entered into a connection with Mrs Bellamy which continued for some years and was productive of much unhappiness The fair apologist in her life glosses over this transaction with the same happy facility with which she has  done many others that were not strictly reconcileable to the laws of virtue or religion She calls it a serious connection which though not binding by the laws of the country with persons of her persuasion was notwithstanding valid to all moral intents and purposes  For the following character of Mr Woodward I am obliged to a cotemporary of his who seemed with great judgment and candour to be well acquainted with his merits  If frequent peals of laughter be a test of merit Mr Woodward most enjoys the favour of the town and maintains it through the variety of comic characters in which he appears In his designing of character he is many times singular but often incorrect if he has not ease he has a manner that stands in the place of it and let him be never so deficient he never displeases his performance being happily calculated to catch the eye at first sight and supported by a vivacity joined to a genteel well made figure that never fails to make a proper impression and bias his audience in his favour In Sofia he is extremely happy and Bobadil by which he  has acquired a vast increase of reputation is a part of his own creation and a proof of his genius he is admirably characteristic and entirely original  Nor has he less merit in Duretete his behaviour when shut up amongst the women is truly admirable His Scrub is rather too grotesque but in Tom and Lissardo he makes up sufficiently for the defect He gave Falstaff much too old an appearance yet a levity of deportment irreconcileable to fat Jack He is well in the Busy Body The character of Flash in Miss in her Teens and the fine gentleman in Lethe he illustrates with so many different strokes of humour that it is hard to say whether in the boasting cowardice of the one or the affected elegance of the other he most excells In those of Touchstone Brass Beau Mizen Mercutio Trappolin he is unrivalled  Upon the whole I must say his acting is spirited and vivacious He has judgment that enables him to dash with unexpected strokes of humour things dull in themselves and he often throws over his performance an  air that inforces on the spectator and give to his performance the appearance of originality  At this period also the merits of Mrs Dancer and Mrs Abington were rising highly in estimation and they were considered by the best judges as the most promising actresses of the day a promise which how well it has been performed it is unnecessary to say  But the same reasons which tempted me in this place to enter upon the character of the gentlemen I have just described induce me to postpone the enquiry concerning these ladies to a time when their fuller merits will yield them more adequate justice  The review we have taken s  ight as it is may be sufficient to give us some idea of the value of the performers of that period and of the respectability to which the Irish stage was then entitled  CHAP V  Barry and Woodward build a Theatre in Cork List of the

SmockalleyMidas at CrowstreetMrs Pritchard engaged thereDecline of Crowstreet Disputes and separation of the ManagersMr King at SmockalleyClose of the season  IN a former chapter of this volume  Chapter the second page    mention has been made of a new theatre built and opened by Messrs Barry and Woodward at Cork Upon subsequent consideration I find that there has been an error in the date It was not  ill the summer of the year the period  which we now are that the new theatre was opened The confusion created by a multiplicity of other avocations was the cause of this mistake and it was not discovered till too late to be rectified a detail somewhat more accurate will I hope in some sort apologise for the error  During the infancy of the stage in Ireland Cork was frequently visited by itinerant companies of comedians who sometimes spent an entire winter there with much emolument The theatres on those occasions were generally temporary structures hastily erected for the immediate purpose  In process of time the Dublin managers extended their views to a city so capable of supplying the intervening time between the close and the opening of their winter seasons  The country companies were obliged to give place to his majesty's servants and a new theatre was erected at the corner of Princesstreet in George'sstreet where the Bush Tavern at present stands and opened in the year On this stage the Elrington's Woffington Sheridan and the most capital performers of the age displayed their powers  Messrs Barry and Woodward with a judicious eye beheld the many advantages likely to arise from a theatre on a more extended scale in so capital a situation the present one being much too small for their processions and pantomimes  They had accordingly advertised a subscription for raising a fund towards building a new theatre The proposal was eagerly embraced in a few weeks the money was raised The ground was purchased in George'sstreet not far from the former building in a situation which every day improved and the work began  The model adopted was that of Crowstreet The dimensions were nearly as large except having but one gallery It was finished and ready for the reception of the company this summer and the public expressed great pleasure at so great an improvement in their favourite amusement  The inside was spacious elegant and convenient it held  l  English at  s  the boxes  s  the pit and  s  the gallery The stage was remarkably roomy being nearly as large as Coventgarden was before the late alterations capable of exhibiting to advantage Mr Barry's grand tragic processions and Mr Woodward's pantomimes both of which were there presented in a stile of perfection which there was not a possibility of doing before  The theatre was opened in July To all the charms of it's novelty the strength of the following company was added  Mr Barry  Mr Woodward  Mr Shuter  Mr Sowdon  Mr Jefferson  Mr Heaphy  Mr Vernon  Mr Austin  Mr Glover  Mr Heatton  Mr Glenvil  Mr Hayes  Mr Adcock  Mr Ellard  Mr Hamilton  Mr Morris  Mr Mynitt  Mr Meffink  Mr Knipe  Mr Mahon  Mr Bridges  Mr Carrol  Mr Oliver  Mr Flury  Mr Stageldoir  Mr Raynor  Mr Aldridge  Mr Neil  Mr Carmichael Prompter  Mrs Dancer  Mrs Hamilton  Mrs Jefferson  Miss Osborne  Two Miss Heattons  Mrs Knipe  Mrs Ellard  Mrs Clark  Mrs Roche  Mrs Packenham  Mrs Adcock  Mrs Bridges  Mrs Glover  Mrs Stageldoir  Mrs Williams  From the above list of performers and indeed from many others which could be given of other times it will plainly appear that the Cork audience have been accustomed to the best of acting From this circumstance in all probability has arisen in a great measure that justness of judgment in theatrical affairs for which they are so remarkable  The same reason will I think warrant me in asserting that none but a Dublin manager can have the least chance of succeeding with them His situation during the winter in the capital and the number of exotics which he is obliged to import every summer give him a superiority in point of entertainment over every other competitor in this kingdom  With such recommendations it is scarcely necessary to say that the Cork season of proved uncommonly brilliant and profitable The company returned to Dublin flushed with success  Mr Woodward lost no time but immediately sailed for England and the day following Mr Mossop arrived with Mrs Abington whom he had gained over from the enemy  The situation of the contending powers at this period was nearly that of equality If there was any superiority it lay on Mr Mossop's side Besides Mrs Abington who then stood so high in public estimation Mrs Fitzhenry had enlisted under his banners Those ladies seemed apprehensive of the power lately acquired by Mrs Dancer and chose the prospect of an undivided empire at the other theatre Mr Ryder who had been absent the last winter returned at this time to Smockalley where in future we shall find him take that lead which his merit so highly entitled him to  To endeavour to balance these losses was Mr Woodward's employment at present in London  Smockalley took the field at this juncture and opened on the th of October with the Spanish Fryar in which Mr Baddely of Drurylane made his first appearance in Gomez  This actor has certainly a great deal of merit in several characters There are many of the Frenchmen Jews and parts of a dry cynical humour which from him have peculiar manner and originality Through the remainder of the season we find him supporting a very respectable line of business such as Touchstone Sir Francis Gripe Frenchman in Lethe Dr Caius Mr Honeycombe c The same night Miss Ambrose made her entrè in Elvira of her but little mention is afterwards made  Amongst the ill effects produced by two theatres was that of seducing performers from their first engagements Changing sides was so much the fashion and some gentlemen were so much in this mode of manoevering that they were sometimes led into great mistakes and have often been called to begin a play at one theatre when they have been found dressing at another  The sanction of the theatre royal continued to be of great use to Crowstreet and Mr Barry opened on the th of October by command of the Earl of Halifax with Romeo  Soon after Mr Woodward returned with the celebrated Miss Elliot then in great reputation as a fine girl and pleasing actress On the th of November following she came forward in her favourite character of Maria in the Citizen which as it was purposely written by Mr Murphy to give scope to her abilities so did she excell in this elegant sprightly playful girl all her successors Mr Woodward was the young Philpot and the farce was several times repeated Miss Elliot afterwards played Mrs Harlow Jessica Euphrosine Miss Notable Cherry Columbine Polly Honeycombe the School Boy c  Much about this time Mr Thomas Barry son to the manager was first introduced to the public in Tamerlane his father playing Bajaze  This young gentleman's figure was light and pleasing but his abilities were far from being of the first rate He just attained mediocrity and might be said never to offend  His next trial was in the interesting Norval Douglas where his age abilities and figure conspired to render him a proper representative for the Scottish youth He continued several  years on the stage and though he could not be considered as a valuable acquisition yet was he of considerable service in supporting a first and second line of characters in tragedy and comedy  Business notwithstanding so much novelty continuing but very indifferent the managers as their dernier resort produced the veteran Macklin who at that time was acknowledged to be the first actor in his line on the stage He was then upwards of sixty years of age His Miser Shylock Iago drew money and were often repeated  In December he brought out his Love A la mode which met with uncommon success being performed upwards of sixteen nights that season In this piece Mr Barry played Sir Callaghan Mr Woodward Squire Groom Mr Messink Beau Mordecai and Mr Macklin Sir Archy M'Sarcasm a farce of such merit and so well supported had not been seen for many years  Amongst the Crowstreet imports of this year Mr Stamper requires to be remembered He  was deservedly esteemed in such characters as the Miser Scrub c Some years after he played at Edinburgh and supported that line of business with much reputation  Fortune at this time seemed to incline towards Mr Mossop The town though torn and divided by contending parties which often produced disagreeable consequences rather favoured his theatre and he was remarkably happy in several of his engagements  I have before mentioned Mr Wilkinson His former popularity and success induced Mr Mossop to consider him as a powerful auxiliary He accordingly concluded a treaty with him for twelve nights and a benefit and he appeared in January in Mr Foote's comedy of the Minor where he personified the characters of Mrs Cole Shift Smirk Transfer and Dr Squintum and which notwithstanding its bad fortune two years before pleased much and brought several houses  Mr Wilkinson's trip fully answered both as to reputation and profit He brought the manager money and his own benefit was remarkbly  great He then acceeded to overtures from Mr Woodward who offered him Twenty guineas for four nights and a clear benefit He consequently appeared at Crowstreet in Kitely in Every Man in his Humour in which Woodward played Bobadil to an excellent house  In the June following Mr Wilkinson returned to England highly pleased with the flattering reception he had met with in Dublin  But what Mr Mossop relied most on and on which he had founded the most sanguine expectations was a species of entertainment which had novelty to recommend it He opened a subscription for an Italian Burletta which fully answered his wishes Most of the nobilith and gentry were pleased with the idea and the subscription filled so well as to enable him to carry his design into execution  After much preparation on the th of December the comic opera of  La Cascina  was performed The principal characters by Signior Antonio Minelli the director of the Burletta Signior Dominico de Amicis Signior Giovan  Battisti Zingoni Signiora Maria Anna de Amicis Signiora Anna Dunlap and Signiora Anna Lucia de Amicis the music by Galuppi the dances by Signior Tioli Signior Giuseppe Genovisi Signiora Ricci and Signiora Vincenze Lucchi The boxes and pit were laid together at five british shillings the galleries remained at their usual prices  The Burletta pleased much The performers were approved of especially Anna Lucia de Amicis who became a great favourite It drew a great deal of money and was continued during the season However they quarrelled among themselves and Signior Minelli the original director was obliged to resign to De Amicis whose family composed the principal part of the entertainment Minelli settled in Dublin in the wine and spirit trade He is still living on the Bachelor'swalk a gentleman of worth and character  To oppose this rage of the public the Burletta of Midas was first produced It's author Kane O'Hara  Esq  was a gentleman of good connections and well known in the fashionable world The piece was put into rehearsal with great expectations and announced in ridicule  of the others under the conduct of Signior Josephi Verneni honest Jo Vernon The principal characters by himself Signior Patrico Mahoni Signior Lewiso Olivero Signiora Fredrisunda Bridgesa Signiora Elizabetta Gloverina and Signiora Maria Juvanelli with dancing by the afterwards celebrated Slingsby  Midas was brought out in January and for some time was strongly supported The Earl of Halifax honoured the th night with his presence and it continued to be occasionally acted during the season  That the Burletta of Midas possesses an extraordinary degree of merit is universally allowed It is in my opinion superior to every one of the numerous productions of that species which have since followed it In its original state of three acts it certainly was too long and palled upon the audience but reduced as at present to an after piece its success has been remarkable and it ever will hold a distinguished place amongst the entertainments of the stage  Fortune still continued to follow the banner of Mr Mossop his houses were in general better attended and more fashionable than those of Crowstreet The Countess of Brandon continued his steady patroness The pieces in which himself and Mrs Fitzhenry appeared generally drew crowded audiences These were considerably strengthened by the accession of another actor who had then been but a short time on the stage yet had displayed great abilities and who a few years after supported the principal characters of the drama with great respectability  This was no other than Mr Reddish who made his first entrè on the Irish stage in Etan in the Orphan of China and made a most favourable impression on the audience by his figure voice manner and other requisites This gentleman remained several years in Ireland and then returned to London where he was much esteemed and admired  The comedy of All in the Wrong written by Mr Murphy was then performing with such eclat in London as to make it well worthy the attention of the Dublin managers Each party  prepared for its representation It was announced with much pomp as in rehearsal at Crowstreet when after five or six days hard study it was most unexpectedly one morning without any previous notice advertised for that evening at Smockalley The consequence was it was pushed on six nights before they could possibly bring it forward at Crowstreet and then it was not worth much to either parties Notwithstanding which it was played sixteen nights that season at Smockalley  But the greatest treat the Crowstreet managers presented to the public was the engagement of Mrs Pritchard That first of English actresses appeared in Lady Macbeth June th Though in the decline of life yet such was the superior force of her powers that she charmed the critical part of her auditors to the highest degree But her figure operated much in her disfavour with many Youth and beauty on the stage make impressions which merit unassisted by these powerful auxillaries can seldom attain  The first appearance of Mrs Pritchard drew a very crowded house Mrs Oakly was her  next which she repeated twice Whether from necessity or whatever other motive I know not but we find this lady placed in several situations in which notwithstanding her uncommon merit she must appear from her figure to little advantage As Mrs Sullen Lady Betty Modish Clarinda and Jane Shore However she made ample amends in Zara and Merope with the latter of which she closed the theatre July th when she returned to England leaving as favourable an impression on the Irish audience as her long tried abilities had unalterably fixed for the English  But notwithstanding any little temporary success during the course of the season the interests of the Crowstreet theatre were visibly on the decline The Lord Lieutenant the Earl of Halifax it is true afforded his patronage and generally commanded at least once a week Several very excellent pantomimes also particularly two new ones the Fair and the Sorcerer were produced Yet in spite of all these advantages and exertions the managers found their receipts infinitely inferior to their disbursements which indeed were too heavy for a Dublin theatre to support  Mr Woodward who was a plain honest man and who had sunk a capital of some thousands the produce of many years oeconomy in London began to grow uneasy and inclined to withdraw himself from the partnership which seemed to threaten final ruin  Mr Barry had less at stake his property was inconsiderable and his fame suffered no diminution from this reverse of fortune He was therefore determined to persevere  The difficulties they were involved in naturally occasioned misunderstandings which success would most probably have prevented Barry thought Woodward's expences for pantomimes too great he in return exclaimed against Barry's tragedy processions Each day added to their differences and towards the close of the season it seemed to be the mutual wish of both to separate  An arbitration appears to hare been entered into between the parties but afterwards not abided by This produced a paper war Each as is customary in such cases laid the blame of  the rupture upon the other and both in all probability were conducive towards it  Mr Woodward commenced hostilities by the following advertisement which appeared in Falkner's Journal  From the late behaviour and conduct of Mr Barry to me relative to the theatre royal I am advised for my own safety to let the public know that the partnership between Mr Barry and me is dissolved and also to caution all persons from giving further credit to the said Barry on the partnership account  HENRY WOODWARD  Monday July th  This produced a recriminating advertisement from Mr Barry which was followed by a second and third of the same nature It would yield but little entertainment to follow the whole of this controversy through all it's stages Much less to copy all which appeared in the newspapers concerning it Suffice it to say it terminated in a total and final seperation  Thus ended a partnership which promised so much success at the beginning and from which though the public occasionally reaped such extraordinary entertainment yet altogether the evils arising more than overbalanced the advantages The managers lost many thousand pounds and involved themselves in a suit in Chancery many debts were contracted not since discharged and many obstinate parties and attachments formed which the following years rather inflamed than appeased  The victorious party to all appearance finished their career with eclat and yet if the truth were known Mr Mossop had no great reason to boast of the state of his finances It was a victory for which the conquerors had reason to weep  Mr King who on quitting Dublin had returned to a high station at Drurylane was at this time a most deserving favourite with the town Him Mr Mossop engaged for a few nights to conclude his campaign with  He appeared in Ranger and Cadwallader and was received with that warmth of applause  which his former character and present improved state merited during his short stay he played the Copper Captain Sharp Oakly Lord George Brilliant Benedick Lovemore Scrub Fribble and Bayes  In these he was capitally supported by Mrs Abington then esteemed one of the first comic actresses ever beheld in this kingdom  Mr Barry led his troops to Cork and Limerick where they spent part of the intervening time 'till the opening of the Crowstreet theatre The following is the bill of their last night at Cork  Being positively the last

struggle with did not deter him from continuing the competition He still had a very powerful party remaining in Dublin His abilities as an actor were universally admired and he hoped by his assiduity to supply the loss of his colleague It was a loss however of too great consequence to be easily suplied Mr Woodward was with great justice a favourite with the town  whilst his attention industry and punctuality added great weight to his management  That Mr Woodward had great reason to be heartily tired of the scheme he was embarked in every one must allow As a private man his character was unexceptionable as a performer he most deservedly stood foremost in his profession and as a manager the public were under many obligations to him Possessed of a capital which with prudence would have rendered him independant for life his evil genius laid the snare of ambition in his way and in a  unlucky hour he consented to lead an opposition  After four years constant anxiety fatigue and trouble he returned to his native country with the loss of the greatest part of his fortune obliged to begin the world again This it must be confessed was enough to four his temper yet it were to be wished he had not on his appearance at Coventgarden when he spoke the following prologue in the character of a returned prodigal put on that humiliating submission which a British audience were too generous to expect  and which the treatment he had experienced in Ireland never could justify  Prologue written and spoke by Mr  WOODWARD  on his first appearance at Coventgarden Theatre in the character of

Bill of Fare  Pointing to a Play Bill  Now waits your Pleasure with his  usual  Air  Oh may I  act  the Part still  o'er and o'er    But never BE the BUSY Body more  The succeeding season in Dublin exhibited nothing very remarkable The theatres were visibly on the decline unable to support the expence of so continued an opposition the managers found every day added to the precariousness and danger of their situation without the least prospect of relief The receipts of the two theatres were scarcely sufficient to defray the expenditure of one The greatest contention seemed to be not who should gain most but who should lose the least  The comic muss was also at this time deprived of her greatest supporters Mr Woodward I have just mentioned Mrs Abington was engaged at Drurylane and Mr Browne I believe returned to Bath The two last were severe losses to Mr Mossop and these were encreased by the desertion of Mr Reddish and Mr Sowdon who had gone over to the adverse party  In some measure to counterballance these he gained over Mr Dexter and imported Mrs Burden who was obliged to support Mrs Abington's line of business with very little advantage to herself a Miss Parsons from the  Haymarket a Miss Skyddart from the Chester company who had a fine voice and opened in Nell and a Miss Stratford whose first appearance was in Cordelia To these were added Mr Foote who opened in the Minor His novelty was now pretty much over and out of his own eccentric pieces little merit could be ascribed to him  The early part of this season introduced to the public a very respectable character a Mr Atkins made his entre at Smockalley in Sir John Loverule Being a painter machinist and harlequin he that winter brought out a pantomime entertainment called Harlequin's Funeral which was liked and brought some money  Some years after Mr Atkins commenced country manager and established his circuit in the north of Ireland His winter residence is chiefly at Belfast where he has lately erected a beautiful elegant theatre and some years ago another at Londonderry These with Armagh and Lisburn form a regular circuit for the year and every encomium is due to Mr Atkins for his conduct character and management  Although Mr Barry's resources were nearly exhausted yet altogether his company seemed superior to Mr Mossop's His tragedies were more uniformly supported as will be seen by the following view of both companies  Crowstreet November    Mr Barry  Mr T Barry  Mr Macklin  Mr Sowdon  Mr Heaphy  Mr Reddish  Mr Sparks  Mr Austin  Mr Hamilton  Mr Ellard  Mr Glenvil  Mr

 Mrs Jefferson  Miss Stratford  Miss Parsons  I have not been able to obtain complete list of Mr Mossop's company this season but the above were the principals  But the greatest support Mr Barry received this season was from the dramatic masque of King Arthur which was performed for the first time in Ireland under his auspices This piec  was got up with great care and attention the paintings were executed in the first style by Carver the machinery by Messink and Finny  The music of king Arthur alone immortalized the great Purcell it proved him the first composer of the age No expence was spared in cloaths and decorations The dances to this piece also added much to its beauty and were executed in the best stile  It was brought out February th in a manner that would have done honour to any stage The effect it produced was equal to the pains bestowed upon it The pulic was charmed with its representation  Music at this time began to make some progress in this kingdom It had always been cultivated but in an inferior degree Hitherto it had been considered as an auxiliary to the theatre but we shall soon find it beginning to take the lead and constituting a principal feature in it's amusements  During the passion week in April oratorios were performed at Crowstreet theatre under the direction of Signior Passerini who had visited Dublin the preceding year  The ensuing after season was memorable for the number of London performers engaged by Mr Barry Mr Shuter Mr Dyer Mrs Clive Mr O'Brien Mr Luke Sparks Mrs Lessingham and the celebrated Nancy Dawson Such a number of capital performers was a great accession of strength and kept the theatre open till August  At this very advanced period was the comic opera of Love in a Village first brought out in this kingdom It had been performed at Coventgarden for a number of nights the preceding winter with that great success and applause it so highly merited  In the infancy as I may stile it of the English vocal drama the appearance of this beautiful opera attracted the attention not only of the musical cognoscenti but also of all ranks and degrees It made an impression unknown since the days of Gay and the Beggar's Opera which  till then had stood unrivalled but was now obliged to behold a very formidable competitor  Indeed I must confess it my opinion that though many excellent operas have since been presented to the public yet none have been more intitled to their approbation than Love in a Village  This opera was capitally supported Young Meadows Mr Mahon Justice Woodcock Mr Shuter Hawthorn Mr Wilder Eustace Mr Dyer How few of our musical gentlemen of equal ability would now play such a character Hodge Mr Glover Sir William Meadows Mr Morris Cook Mr Messink Mrs Deborah Woodcock Miss Mason

fatal consequencesFranchises of DublinMr Mossop obliges the several Corporations at the FranchisesThe Lord M  y  r bespeak a Play  THE vice regal favour which had on so many occasions been of infinite service to the theatreroyal operated at the beginning of the ensuing season very powerfully The new Lord Lieutenant and his Lady the Earl and Countess of Northumberland were just arrived and very popular The theatre opened October a few days after they commanded Othelio with the Virgin Unmasked and very often during the winter honoured it with their presence  In this place I cannot help remarking the to those chief governors who court popularity no place can present a better opportunity of attaining it than the theatre Through the course of this work I have had occasion to observe that the more popular the Lord Lieutenant was the oftener he frequented the theatre  But Mr Barry's principal reliance was on his engagement with Mr Sheridan whose abilities and many virtues had justly endeared him to the public This much injured gentleman was at this time induced once more to revisit his native country He had during his absence the honour of being preceptor to the queen and had obtained a pension from his majesty which had rendered his circumstances somewhat easier He now returned with hopes that the public sensible of the wrongs he had suffered might devise some means of recompenceing him  Still more to weaken the adverse party Mr Barry had the address to bring over once more to his standard Mrs Fitzhenry The last three years she had spent at Smockalley Her return was of great service and it might then be said  that Crowstreet could exhibit tragedies worthy the attention of the public supported by Barry Sheridan Reddish Heaphy Jefferson Mrs Fitzhenry Miss Osborne then Mrs William Barry and Mrs Dancer  In comedy they could not boast so much Mrs Kennedy from Drurylane was excellent in a peculiar line of characters such as the Old Maid Mrs Honeycombe c but neither her age nor figure qualified her to lead in elegant comedy Mr Barry's greatest strength in that line was Mr Wilkinson The late excursions of this gentleman to Ireland had proved so pleasant and profitable that we find him early this season possessed of much attraction and drawing money to Mr Foote's pieces particulary his Mayor of Garret which was then first brought out in Dublin and performed several nights  Mr Wilkinson's engagement ended in January when after an excellent benefit he set off for Scotland and Mr Macklin having joined Mr Mossop the remainder of the season we  had entirely  the ascendancy and that very few comedies were played in Crowstreet  Early in November Mrs Fitzhenry opened in Calista and a few nights after Mr Sheridan came forward in Hamlet a character he had sustained with the greatest respectability both in London and Dublin The first actresses then did not think it beneath them give force and dignity to the Queen Mrs Pritchard played it in London Mrs Fitzhenry in Dublin The house was crowded to receive Mr Sheridan and the reiterated applauses which marked his first entrance evidently spoke the feelings of the audience on the return of a man whom the world justly considered as an ornament to the stage and an honour to the kingdom that gave him birth  His next appearance was in Richard which was graced with the presence of the Lord Lieutenant and his Countess After this the two tragedians combined their strength and played Pierre and Jaffier Brutus and Caffius King John and the Bastard Hastings and Shore Othello and Iago Desdemona Mrs Dancer Emelia Mrs Fitzhenry Castalio  and Chamont In many tragedies we find the four as All for Love Marc Antony and Ventidius Octavia and Cleopatra Orestes and Pyrrhus Andromache and Hermione Alexander and Clytus Roxana and Statira The Penitent Horatio Mr Sheridan Sciolto Mr Heaphy Altamont Mr T Barry Lothario Mr Barry Lavinia Mrs T Barry Calista Mrs Fitzhenry  Towards the latter end of the season business beginning to decline Mr Barry engaged a company of Italian Burletta performers who opened the th of April by command with the Burletta of La Serva Padrona or the Maid the Mistress The characters by Signor and Signora Guerina c but I believe the success of these Burletta's was but very moderate and scarcely answered the expence attending them  'Tis now time to take a view of Mr Mossop's operations He judiciously seemed sensible of the power of his competitor in tragedy therefore instead of encountering him in the line where his principal strength lay lie directed the force of his own operations to comedy and musical pieces His retaining Mrs Abington and  Mr Ryder and his junction with Mr Macklin were of great service to him in the former and fortune pointed out an object which abundantly answered his purpose in the latter  Miss Catley's vocal powers and uncommon abilities were then just beginning to captivate the public in London Mr Mossop invited her over to this kingdom and she arrived late in December Her first appearance was in Polly in the Beggar's Opera in which the applause she gained was uncommon She pleased beyond expression and so highly established her fame that even in the ensuing Christmas holidays the most unfashionable part of the season the houses were crowded each night with the first auditors in the kingdom to her Polly  Opera now began to rear her head and take the lead in the attractions of the drama and she has ever since retained this powerful charm in a very superior degree Miss Catley instantly became a decided favourite The Beggar's Opera was often repeated and her Rosetta in  Love in a Village drew much money to the theatrical treasury  Mr Mossop although his genius did not by any means incline to the laughter loving goddess had yet selected an excellent comedy company With Mrs Abington Mr Macklin Mr Ryder Mr Dexter Mrs Lessingham from Coventgarden who had played a few nights in the latter season at Crowstreet Mr Stamper Mr Hamilton Mrs Kelf Miss Ambrose Miss Usher Mr Walker c many comedies were performed with much credit  Few particulars of this season remain worth noticing one however was attended with circumstances too shocking to be passed over in silence  On one of the crowded nights at Crowstreet in the month of April two gentlemen leading some ladies to their chairs were grossly insulted by a number of servants waiting at the box doors who not only abused them in the foulest manner but followed them on their return into the box room till prevented by the centinels then on duty Not content with outrage  a number of them threw their lighted flambeaux into the box room crying out at the same time fire fire  Such an outery joined to the smoke of the flambeaux occasioned an instantaneous terror easier to be imagined than described Perhaps there is not a more alarming circumstance in nature than that of upwards of a thousand people confined in a theatre being terrified with the sudden exclamation of fire without knowing from whence the danger arises or how to avoid it Terror magnifies the most petty trifles into objects of alarm and fear takes from people the power of pursuing proper measures for their safety  The consternation this alarm excited instantly communicated itself to every individual in the house The cry of fire resounded from every part of the theatre The cries and shrieks of the females and the efforts of the men to extricate themselves from this supposed danger produced a scene truly terrific and shocking The house was cleared as soon as possible The mistake was discovered but not till a great deal of mischief had happened  Numberless were the accidents this wicked contrivance produced Happily however only two lives were lost Those were Mr Eaton a Butcher of Ormond Market and his wife who were trampled to death by the violent pressure of the crowd from the upper gallery What added to the poignancy of the distress was they left behind them eight children totally unprovided for  Where there are proper objects the public is never deficient in compassion and humanity On this occasion they embraced every opportunity of manifesting this goodlike disposition A benefit free of every expence was announced at each theatre Every performer of consequence came forward and was eager to offer his services Each night was crowded besides which there was a subscription set on foot which altogether raised a sum that provided very respectably for these unhappy orphans thus bereft of their parents  Mr Sheridan who still laboured under difficulties which his former misfortunes had involved him in having nearly finished his engagement with Mr Barry proposed giving lectures  on oratory and the English language in the Music Hall early in May This his creditors ungenerously and injudiciously prevented him from and he was obliged to acquaint the public that though he had appropriated three fourths of his income to the discharge of his debts yet such was their cruelty that the safety of his person would have been endangered if he had ventured to go on with his lecture  In June Mr Shuter again visited Dublin and appeared in several of his favourite characters at Smockalley which with his support kept open till the beginning of August during which time Love in a Village Thomas and Sally Comus The Devil to Pay c were often repeated  Mr Barry notwithstanding his exertion after an unsuccessful campaign closed in June leaving Mr Mossop in possession of the field and repaired as usual to Cork and Limerick where he experienced better fortune which the excellence of his company highly entitled him to as many be seen by the following bill  By Permission of the Right Worshipful JOHN SMITH  Esq  Mayor of CORK For

raising the popularity of Mr Mossop The triennial perambulation of the city liberties or riding the franchises as they were then stiled was so much the fashion that on those occasions the different corporations went to very great expence in preparing the decorations and paraphernalia which distinguished their respective bodies and those only who have been spectators of the magnificence novelty variety and splendour of this singular  cavalcade can be proper judges of the effects it produced  From the great variety of dresses which the wardrobe of a theatre must necessarily consist of it was always in a managers power to assist in a peculiar manner such representations and so amply did Mr Mossop contribute to the brilliancy and pageantry of the present that several of the corporations returned their acknowledgments to him in the public papers  for lending them habits ornaments and decorations which added considerably to the splendour of the franchises  On this occasion also the Right Honourable William Forbes then Lord Mayor and in high favour with the city desired a play August th  For the entertainment of the Aldermen the Sheriffs and the Master Wardens and Brethren of the city of Dublin  The play chosen was Richard the d Richard Mr Mossop King Henry Mr Aickin Tressel Mr Ryder Duke of York Master Dawson Lady Anae Mrs Kelf Queen Mrs Usher  I must confess I think it was a

or judgment exist Very capital dancers were also engaged and we find those exotics constituted a leading feature in the ensuing winter's amusements  As it will be impossible for me to follow all the

performances▪ the Beggar's Opera with new accompaniments by Signior Giordani was next brought forward which with Love in a Village and the new Burletta were performed ternately six or seven nights each The burletta pleased much Spiletta was a great favourite but Catley's voice and whimsical stile of  singing soon took the lead and drew crowded houses  Mr Collins whom the public have lately beheld with infinite pleasure entertaining an audience for three hours entirely by the force of genuine humour and native comic talents made his first appearance on the boards of Smockalley in Young Mirabel in the inconstant and proved a very respectable acquisition to the Irish stage I find his name afterwards for Justice Woodcock Dick in the Confederacy Peachum Sir Francis Wronghead Bastard in Lear Angelo Gibby c  The early part of Mr Barry's season proved rather profitable To the novelty of the Venetians and rope dancing he prefixed his strongest tragedies His receipts were encreased but his expences were enormous When public curiosity abated he had recourse to a stratagem which as it was attacking the enemy on their own ground answered his purpose equal to his most sanguine expectations  The rage for Catley was this time so great that it was highly expedient to endeavour to  stem the torrent Conscious that his musical performers were not equal to those of Smockalley he boldly announced the Beggar's Opera Captain Macheath by himself Polly by Mrs Dancer and Lucy by Mrs Abington The novelty of the attempt excited the curiosity of the public and it drew much money  Certain it is that though his vocal abilities could not enable him to compass the common tunes of this well known piece yet his figure manner and acting of this intrepid highwayman made ample amends and perhaps he altogether gave a portrait of this favourite character equal if not superior to any that ever attempted it since the original He really was the sine gay bold faced gentleman of the road  Gay's Polly received from Mrs Dancer a delicacy a pathos and interesting colouring which few vocal performers have ever been able to give it Mrs Abington's Lucy was esteemed a capital piece of acting  The remaining parts of the opera were supported in the following manner Peachum  Mr Macklin Lockit Mr Sparks Mat o'th' Mint Mr Mahon Jenny Diver Mrs Mahon Mrs Peachum Mrs Kennedy  The first night it brought  l  the second  l  the third  l  the fourth  l  the fifth  l  It was afterwards performed several nights in the course of the season with varied success  To oppose this new and unexpected stroke Mr Mossop thought of another equally nouvelle Miss Catley had then got such possession of the public that whatever she attempted was sure to meet with uncommon approbation She had long drawn houses in Polly She now assumed the opposite character and figured in the rakish joyous Macheath  This had the desired effect and excited curiosity in a very high degree and the Beggar's Opera proved another source of dispute and contention at Smockalley Mr Collins played Peachum Mr Wilder Mat o'th' Mint Mrs Wilder Lucy Mr Rider Mrs Slammakin Mrs Usher Diana Trapes and Miss Dunlop Polly It was with Love in a Village given  once a week during most of the season The former was played fifteen nights the latter ten  Mrs Abington's return to Smockalley theatre about the middle of the season caused a new revolution in the Beggar's Opera she played Polly and Signiora Spiletta appeared in Lucy  The latter was indeed an arduous task Being almost unacquainted with the language she was obliged to apologize to the public before she performed it But favourites often have a licence to be absurd and in the present case Spiletta got more applause than if she had been a native  Scarce were the merits of this musical strugg  decided when the comic opera of the Maid of the Mill gave occasion for a fresh contest This excellent opera was then performing with the greatest success at Coventgarden  Both managers thought it an object worth their utmost attention The words of the opera were published and equally free for both But  the music was in manuscript and the sole property of the Coventgarden manager From him Mr Barry purchased it and consequently imagined he had in this instance securely triumphed over his antagonist  In this dilemma Mr Mossop found an unexpected resource in the great abilities of Signior Giordani It is a fact well established that though the parts were writing out in Dublin for Mr Barry yet did Signior Giordani sit down and new compose the entire opera of the Maid of the Mill in full score with all the accompaniments in less than a fortnight and it was written out studied the scenes painted and the opera brought out two nights before they were able to accomplish it at Crowstreet  The opera pleased much The music did infinite credit to the genius of Signior Giordani It was considered by every judge as a wonderful effort of the human mind and to it were applied Pope's words  "The sound becomes an echo to the sense"  I should imagine it will add to the entertainment of the reader to compare the strength of each company in supporting the pieces in question The Maid of the Mill was thus performed at each theatre     CrowStreet  SmockAlley  Lord Aimworth  Mr Barry  Mr Ryder  Sir H Sycamore  Mr Mahon  Mr Collins  Fairfield  Mr Glover  Mr Dawson

opera of Artaxerxes was for the first time performed in this kingdom at Smockalley Arbaces by  Signior Passerini Artaxerxes Signior Peretti Artabanes Mr Wilder Rimenes Mr Ryder Semira Mrs Hawtrcy and Mandane Miss Catley  We may judge of the strength of the musical pieces this season under Mr Mossop when we find the Beggar's Opera exhibited eleven nights Love in a Village sixteen Artaxerxes fourteen besides the Maid of the Mill Comus the Jovial Crew and the Italian Burlettas  Catley closed her career the th of May in Rosetta after which she sailed for England being announced as engaged for the next winter with her present manager Mr Mossop Her departure put an end to the musical pieces  Mr Mossop closed the th of May informing the public that he intended opening speedily again with English operas having engaged several capital singers from England  It is time now to return to Mr Barry Hard pushed by the vocal powers of his opponents and burthened with a very heavy company he found his finances much impaired towards  the end of this hardfought campaign Fortune however seemed more propitious when he confined his efforts within their proper sphere  The tragedy of the Countess of Salisbury was at this time offered to his acceptance The author was a native of this kingdom a gentleman of good connections and the piece possessed much merit The language was flowery the story which was founded on Dr Leland's Langsword Earl of Salisbury pathetic and interesting It was got up with care and met with great success  Salisbury was well adapted to display the powers of Mr Barry and Mrs Dancer in the original part of the Countess exhibited those amazing abilities which have so often since enraptured the admirers of melpom  e and which have so deservedly placed her at the very pinnacle of theatric excellence  The Countess of Salisbury was performed  nights though brought out so late in the season and Mr Barry finished in July Salisbury was afterwards acted in the Haymarket and Drurylane  A few days after Mr Mossop according to his promise brough out his first new English opera as he was pleased to stile it This was Amintas or the Royal Shepherd in which the celebrated Signior Tenducci so much admired in the musical world first appeared Alexander was performed by Signior Perretti Agenor Mr Wilder Thamyris Miss Thomas from Coventgarden and Eliza by Signiora Cremonini from the Opera house their first appearance in this kingdom  The uncommon vocal powers and judgment of Signior Tenducci had already raised his fame  most of the courts in Europe nor did his merits make less impression in Dublin He was allowed to be by far the most capital foreign singer that ever visited these kingdoms and his reception was so flattering that we find him embracing every opportunity of returning to this country  Amintas and Alexander were the only opera's performed at this time but these were repeated twice a week during the summer and closed the beginning of October  In the interim Mr Barry was with a very capital company performing at Cork where unrivalled he gained reputation and profit  There was also another very strong detachment at this time at Drogheda Amongst the principal performers were Mr Macklin Mr Ryder Mr Lewis Mr Austin Mrs Kelf Mrs Austin c  CHAP IX  Musical pieces continue to take the leadNew performersMiss Ashmore first

Thomas a new Lucy and Mr Ryder's Scapin  Tenducci's operas were continued with a very moderate share of success and a crowd of new performers imported or recruited from the country as Mrs Pearson Mr Tyler Mr  Pearson Mr Richards Mr and Mrs Gemea Mr Smith Mr Blisset afterwards an actor of much merit  Amongst the group unnoticed and unknown was Mr Edwin who in Sir Philip Modelove first courted the acquaintance of the Irish audience Long were the abilities of this eccentric actor obscured nor could the profoundest dramatic judge then discover those talents which nature had so liberally endowed him with o  the extraordinary eminence he afterwards atta  ned Mr Edwin was at that time very young He remained here two seasons and we find him in Old Philpot Lord Trinket Justice Woodcock c  This season Mr and Mrs Reddish changed sides and with Mr Glover went over to Smockalley So much in fashion indeed was the custom at this time of performers changing from one manager to another that it would be impossible with accuracy to follow them through their various theatrical transitions  Operas still continued entirely the fashion at Smockalley and drew considerable sums to Mr  Mossop's treasury The new opera of Athridates run upwards of a dozen nights  In this piece Miss Ashmore since Mrs Sparks was first introduced to the public she sung a pleasing air of "Dearest Mother" much adapted to her powers and in which she was well instructed by Signior Tenducci The audience were highly delighted with this new little favourite who some years afterwards charmed them in a variety of characters  Towards the middle of the season like many others she changed sides and played Cupid in King Arthur at Crowstreet she there had part of a benefit at which she appeared in the Virgin Unmasked  It was with the utmost concern Mr Barry perceived his opponent crowned with success which his utmost exertions could not prevent The credit and reputation of his theatre had been for a long time gradually lessening and the certain consequences appeared salaries unpaid and debts contracted which he had not ability to discharge  Thus disagreeably situated he embraced an expedient which though it procured him temporary relief was attended with reproach and disgrace to the theatre He introduced a new set of performers to the town These were no other than Dutch dogs and an Italian monkey who in a new pantomime displayed those tricks which ought solely to be confined to their proper sphere a booth where sense and reason are set at defiance and where an admirer of the drama would be ashamed to appear  Nor were the common arts of opposition left untried Performers allured by empty promises and imaginary honour were continually changing their situation and besides Miss Ashmore whom I have just mentioned Mr and Mrs Reddish Miss Slack Signiora Spiletta Tenducci Cremonini with several others were enticed from Smockalley to Crowstreet  The novelty of Tenducci and the foreigners was nearly exhausted whilst the attractions of Catley who adhered with honour to Mr Mossop encreased every night She had at this time nearly arrived at the zenith of her reputation  and I believe I may venture to affirm that she drew as much money to the Irish theatre as any vocal performer ever did either before or since nor did she confine herself to one line of singing She played Polly Macheath and Lucy She relinquished Sally and made a capital part of Dorcas and gave up what few capital singers would Rosetta and played Deborah Woodcock  It would be tedious and I am afraid unentertaining to my readers to enter into the miniutiae of each theatre suffice it then to mention merely what may serve to convey to them a just idea of the more essential and important articles  The following anecdote was given me from respectable authority and is now mentioned as a proof that actors are not always the best judges of pieces Notwithstanding the uncommon merit and extraordinary success of the Clandestine Marriage the early part of this season at Drury Lane a piece which one should imagine only slightly to peruse were sufficient to make any reader of common understanding pronounce it one of the best comedies in the English language  et strange to relate at the first reading of it  in the Green Room of Crowstreet in December the whole company concurred in opinion that it was not worth the trouble of getting up  It was accordingly laid aside unil Mr T Barry's benefit The novelty inclined him to have it studied and performed when it pleased so wonderfully that it was played twice a week at Cork the following summer and many nights the ensuing winter  Before I dismiss this season I must mention the death of Mr Lewis Duval the original proprietor of the Smock Alley theatre and who until his death which was when he was upwards of ninety had an annual benefit at that theatre  Though much embarrassed yet not entirely disheartened by the ill success of the two last campaigns Mr Barry once more prepared to meet his competitor for public favour and seemed to take the field with a force superior to that of his adversary as may be seen by the subjoined list  Crowstreet  Mr Barry  Mr T Barry  Mr Macklin  Mr Brown  Mr Lewis  Mr Heaphy  Mr Sparks  Mr Dawson  Mr Usher  Mr Mahon  Mr Austin  Mr Glenville  Mr Vernell  Mr Massey  Mr Messink  Mr Palmer  Mr Maguire

lay on Mr Barry's side but in reality it was the reverse every effort of his at the beginning of the season proved unsuccessful whilst Catley brought crowded houses at the other theatre  In this exigence Mr Barry turned his eyes towards Mr Sheridan with whom he concluded a treaty and who on this occasion was of great service By accident it happens that the receipts of Mr Sheridan's first four houses are  in my possession which for the readers information I am happy to ascertain  I must premise that at this period the business in general was very bad Love in a Village  peated five nights

sorry it is not in my power to follow him through the remainder of his characters but by the above specimen we may readily perceive that he contributed much towards the reestablishment of Mr Barry's shattered finances but even with this extraordinary assistance it was not in his power to save himself and at the conclusion of the winter he found he was more involved than ever  Few occurrences worth mentioning happened at either theatre during the present season Mr Mossop still preserved the superiority he had obtained though in truth he had very little reason to boast  Amongst the new performers he introduced▪ at this time was Miss Browne daughter of Mr Sowdon an elegant figure a pleasing singer and possessed of much merit both in tragedy and comedy she played Polly six nights then Rosetta Patty Fanny in the Clandestine Marriage c  This lady afterwards became the wife of Mr Jackson a gentleman of abilities as a writer and actor and of a most respectable character who made his first appearance in Dublin much about the same time with deserved reput  tion  Mr and Mrs Jackson remained in Dublin several seasons and sustained a principal line of business in the varied walks of the drama with much credit Some years after Mr Jackson purchased the Edinburgh theatre and patent from Mr Ross the then patentee where he continued manager untill very lately with much credit and character  About this period Mr George Alexander Stevens for the first time visited this kingdom with his celebrated Lecture upon Heads and  exhibited in the Little Theatre in Capelstreet with infinite applause The novelty of his undertaking drew the attention of the public  Though not possessed of much merit as an actor yet he certainly delivered his lectures with vast humour variety and judgment reputation and success attended him in both kingdoms and in the course of a few years he acquired an independant fortune solely by the repetition of this then singular species of entertainment  CHAP X  Mr Barry obliged to relinquish the contestEffects of itMr Mossop sole ManagerPurchases both TheatresOpens in Crowstreet December    Mr Clinch's first appearanceMiss Catley performsMr Brownlow Ford  Mr Sheridan Mr King and Mrs Atington at the latter Season    BUT every circumstance now seemed to indicate the rapid decline of the drama in Ireland Novelty in a great measure had lost its charms rancour and ill will prevailed amongst the performers The town was divided and exhausted between the Barryists and Mossopians Both parties were heartily tired of the contest yet neither were willing to resign their pretensions  The very great merits of the two managers procured them a number of zealous partizans but these were not sufficient to support their respective theatres The few moderate and discerning beheld with concern the ruin that attended the Dublin stage from these divisions yet knew not how to remedy an evil which every day's experience encreased and rendered more apparent  At length the superior genius of Mr Mossop prevailed After a seven years contest Mr Barry was obliged to resign the field to his then seemingly more fortunate rival having during that time experienced more chagrin vexation and disappointment than imagination can well conceive Harrassed in mind and body he had lavished so many years of the prime of his life and instead of reaping the fruits of such shining abilities as nature had blessed him with had incurred debts he could never discharge ruined many persons connected with him and involved himself in difficulties which during the remainder of his life he could never surmount  His I c  nnot call him successful competitor was not in a much more enviable situation His  finances were also much deranged his credit impaired and his resources nearly exhausted However he had the town now to himself and he hoped that having accomplished so important a point a few successful seasons would amply recompense him for the many disagreeable days he had spent in the endeavour to effect it  The first step he took was to obtain possession of both theatres which as he imagined struck at the root of all future rivalship and gave him leisure to recruit his shattered fortunes  He played about a month in Smockalley whilst Crowstreet was repairing where he was aided by the novelty of Mrs Fitzhenry whose return from London was welcomed by her native audience with that warmth and cordiality which evinced how dear she was to them and how high she stood in their estimation  The th of December Mr Mossop came forward for the first time as sole monarch of Crowstreet domains in the character of Richard the Third Curiosity however did not produce the effect expected The  house was far from being crowded the receipts amounting only to  l    s    d  Irish money  Nevertheless several of his tragedies brought large sums of money to his treasury The Orphan of China in particular one night reached  l    s    d  Mr Brown ever a favourite with the public was well attended in his principal characters in comedy and Mrs Fitzhenry gave evident proofs at her benefit how respectable her interest was amongst all ranks She took the Countess of Salisbury and had  l    s    d  Irish in her house which I believe was as much as ever had then been known on one night  In the month of February the tragedy of the Orphan was revived for the purpose of introducing a young and new candidate for public favour The character selected for his first appearance was Castalio a favourite part of Mr Barry's and in which he had displayed such sweetness tenderness and variety Arducus as the task was our adventurer exceeded the most sanguine expectations of his friends and impressed the town with the most lively hopes that  in this youthful hero they had found an excellent substitute for their departed favourite  Curiosity and connections drew numbers the first night which amounted to  l    s    d  and so highly was the audience delighted with the performance of this promising son of Thespis that the play in the course of a few weeks drew a number of respectable audiences His next attempts were Jaffier Lothario and Essex which were attended with an equal degree of success  Fame a length proclaimed the name of this promising actor to be Clinch a young gentleman of respectable family and connexions and who had received a liberal education The public certainly had every reason to expect a valuable acquisition in him Nature had been very bountiful His figure was excellent his face manly and expressive his voice strong clear impressive possessed of great variety and many of its tones bore a great resemblance to their much loved Barry's  Time has since proved their conjectures were well founded The public are at present well  acquainted with his various merits and he is not only justly considered as one of the principal ornaments of the Irish stage but also universally beloved and esteemed for the many virtues which adorn his private character  Though in possession of the town Mr Mossop did not neglect presenting it with every novelty in his power and none could be more acceptable than its darling Catley who was engaged for six nights and charmed once more with her musical powers  A Mr Brownlow Forde also made his appearance in Scrub whilst Mr Mossop by way of variety for it certainly could not be for its excellence endeavoured to represent the easy elegant fashionable Archer Mr Forde afterwards played Sir Joseph Wittol Brisk c  Mr Sheridan who at this time was delivering his lectures at the Musichall in Fishamblestreet was also prevailed on towards the end of the season to perform three of his principal characters Hamlet Richard and Cato at each of which times he amply experienced  a continuance of public patronage and favour  In the latter season Mr King and Mrs Abington once more visited this metropolis and appeared in most of their favourite characters The Lord Ogleby of Mr King was then new and exceedingly popular It was justly esteemed one of the finest pieces of acting the world ever beheld  For many years I have had the pleasure of seeing this truly excellent actor in this part and can with justice affirm that for correctness of conception spirit of execution and in short for every requisite to constitute a finished performance I never beheld a more perfect representation than his Lord Ogleby The whimsical traits of the Old Man of Quality debilitated by years and intemperance yet retaining the inclinations and affecting the vigour of youth are by him exhibited with a spirit and fidelity which we have seldom seen equalled I shall not dread correction when I assert that the stage in all its various departments cannot at present produce better performance  CHAP XI  Much novelty in the season    Two new Ladies in the Beggar's OperaMr Cornely's Mr SaundersMr FooteThe Devil upon two SticksRope DancersTheir ill success Mr and Mrs Walker Miss GrosseFailure of the PadlockMiss Catley revives itThe School for RakesMr Mossop visits Cork  THE following winter Mr Mossop resolved to give novelty 'till it cloyed the appetite The first night he presented a new Polly and Lucy in the Beggar's Opera The former was a Miss Hudson the latter a Miss Reade they both possessed a moderate share of merit and were tolerably well received  A few nights after Mr Cornely's made his debut in Ralph in the Maid of the Mill and from his first entrè stamped an impression on the  audience which his merit afterwards amply confirmed  Mr Cornellys was followed by a Mr Saunders from Drurylane in Polonius and Mrs Wright in the Queen The next night Mrs Saunders formerly Miss Reynolds an actress of real intrinsic merit came forward in Violante in the Wonder and Combrush in the Honest Yorkshireman These novelties however had no effect and the theatre promised to be unfashionable and unfrequented  This unfavourable prospect made Mr Mossop hasten his intended operations In November Mr Foote's new comedy of The Devil upon Two Sticks was got up on purpose to introduce this eccentric hero again to this kingdom The first night was commanded by the new and popular Lord Lieutenant Lord Townshend the house was crowded the receipts  l    s    d  and the piece succeeded equal to his most sanguine expectations Mr Foote at this time was of infinite service He seldom played to less than an hundred pounds and sometimes to an hundred and thirty  Mr Mossop's engagement with Le Nemora Semanzati and Signiora Rossoli was not so fortunate Though excellent in their performances on the rope the public were disgusted with such exhibitions They had not attraction the first night which amounted to only  l  I sincerely wish the public were ever of the same mind and whilst their bounty should enable managers to provide the noblest and most rational entertainment the human mind can receive a selection of the various beauties of the drama to banish such species of entertainment to their proper sphere of action  Necessity almost always forces managers to resources their judgment condemns and there are few instances where they have been adopted till every other exertion has failed In such cases I must confess I think them more to be pitied than condemned  The remainder of the season glided away without any very remarkable occurrence  Mr and Mrs Walker after passing a few years at Coventgarden returned to this kingdom  and proved an addition to the Irish stage Mr Walker had much merit in tyrants as Barbarossa Timurkan Bajazet and Mrs Walker great vivacity life and spirit in the Chambermaids  A Miss Grosse made her first appearance in Lady Townly for which she had hardly a requisite Her second attempt however rectified this mistake and in Rosetta she gave hopes of adding to the entertainment of the public to whom she was afterwards known by the name of Mrs Barre She had a strong clear commanding voice and afterwards proved a useful member of the dramatic society  Notwithstanding the general success of musical pieces of merit the very excellent and at present popular comic opera of the Padlock was at this time an exception It was brought out in January l with every advantage after Mr Mossop's Hamlet to  l  when so little impression did it make that the second night there was only  l  the third  l  afte  which it was obliged to be tacked to Mr Mossop's strong tragedies  Yet notwithstanding this it is certain that there is not a more pleasing musical afterpiece in the English language or one possessed of more merit either in character incident or musical composition Indeed it is the only instance I ever knew or heard of its failing Few pieces I believe were ever oftner repeated drew more money or gained more applause  The original cast of it in Dublin was as follows Leander Mr J Bannister from Drurylane Mungo Mr Wilder Don Diego Mr Vernel Ursula Mrs Saunders and Leonora Mrs Hudson  Miss Catley still in fashion visited Dublin in March and as usual brought crowded houses to her favourite characters especially to Comus which at that time seemed to be the leading piece in which her Euphrosine will be long remembered and as it ought to be recorded amongst the excellencies of dramatic performances Her playing Leonora in the Padlock at this time first gave it a reputation which it has ever since maintained  The comedy of the school for rakes the production of our ingenious country woman Mrs Griffith was then performing with eclat at Drurylane Mr Mossop presented it to the public towards the latter end of the campaign when it proved highly acceptable and was often repeated  The season which was undisputed and profitable closed early in June and Mr Mossop for the first time visited Cork where his fame had long before rendered the public impatient to gratify their curiosity by beholding such uncommon merit and eager to join the universal opinion which concurred in admiring his extraordinary excellencies He brought great houses and returned to Dublin the latter end of September following to commence his winter operations  CHAP XII  Mr Mossop opens September    Indifferent successMiss Ashmore risingNew performers Mossop plays alternately at each houseLittle Theatre in Capelstreet opensThe managers of itFalse delicacyThe two companies compared Success of Capelstreet houseLionel and Clarissa at both housesClose of the seasonSituation of the parties  NOTWITHSTANDING Mr Mossop opened early the th of October with the Polly of Catley who was announced only for a few nights yet the beginning of his season was not very auspicious This great favourite had at that time lost part of her attraction and an indisposition confining her after she had played a few nights the manager was himself obliged to come forward in Hamlet which brought a tolerable house  l  With every requisite of face figure voice and abilities Miss Ashmore then just rising in her profession began to attract general notice and with irresistible force put in her modest claim to public favour a claim which was universally allowed and which for many years she most deservedly enjoyed without interruption  Amongst the parts she was then most noticed in were Polly and Lucy in the Beggar's Opera Rosetta Arethusa in the Contrivances Leonora in the Padlock Patty in the Maid of the Mill Phillida Sally Ophelia Leonora Revenge Irene Barbarossa Cordelia Lear Emeline in King Arthur Flora in the Wonder Portia Hypolita Kind Impostor Cherry c So promising an actress had not been seen in Ireland a long time and we shall find that she fully answered the high opinion conceived of her great talents  Amongst the new performers of the season were Miss Glassington who appeared in Violante Mr and Mrs Graham in Scrub and Mrs Sullen Miss Mansell for the first time on any stage in Juliet Besides these the manager presented the town with Rope Dancers  equilibrists on the wire c in every form and variety  In possession of both theatres Mr Mossop indulged his fancy by playing by turns in each Tragedies which alone brought money at Crowstreet comedies with the rope and wire at Smockalley Public taste was never more conspicuous than on this occasion Tragedies were seldom performed to less than to ninety or an hundred pounds whilst the performances on the wire and rope seldom ammounted to  l  often under  l  Tamerlane was revived about this time and brought several houses Mr Mossop's Bajazet most certainly was amongst his best performances and added much to his reputation Tamerlane Mr Heaphy Moneses Mr Clinch Axalla Mr Bannister Selima Miss Glassington Arpasia Mrs Fitzhenry  The theatrical world may justly be considered as an epitome of the world at large Her empires have as great a variety of interests and are subject to as many vicissitudes and revolutions Firmly as Mr Mossop thought himself seated  on the dramatic throne of this kingdom yet did he find conspiracies formed against him which though at first he disregarded them yet did the hand of time mature and ripen into a success he thought impossible  Lulled into perfect security by the certainty of having the two theatres of Crowstreet and Smockalley he little imagined that a third could be opened The event shewed how much he was mistaken  The little theatre in Capelstreet had for many years been shut up and appropriated to other  es It was certainly very small but even this was of advantage as it could be fitted up at less expence could be much easier filled and consequently derive more credit from less shew  This revolution was concerted and compassed with much address and united the interests of Mr Dawson Mr Mahon and Mr Wilkes Dawson was the manager of this new erected company and by the experience he had had was in many respects equal to the task He was active industrious and intelligent well acquainted with the world and prompt to improve  every opportunity fortune threw in his way The theatre was elegantly ornamented and beautified the scenes new painted by Jolly The wardrobe as might be expected light but fashionable and shewy  Every arrangement being adjusted in the best manner the times would permit the new adventurers opened on Monday February th with a new comedy never performed in this kingdow written by Hugh Kelly  Esq  and then in reputation in London

Glenville Leander Mr Wilkes Mungo Mr Mahon Ursula Mrs Hoskins And the part of Leonora by Miss Ashmore  It must be acknowledged that though there were several performers of the first merit in the new erected company yet they could not in numbers or indeed abilities compare with the veterans of Crowstreet nor could they from any apparent circumstances flatter themselves with the hopes of that success which crowned their adventurous schemes  This observation will be better illustrated by a comparative view at the commencement of the opposition  CrowStreet  Mr Mossop  Mr Clinch  Mr Heaphy

Mossop might in some measure be justified for holding in such a contemptuous light the new formed opposition But what human prudence could not foresee fortune speedily accomplished  Curiosity and interest crowded Capelstreet theatre the first night and the performances were received with the most unbounded applause The new theatre dresses novelty of the play and several of the performers the brilliancy of every object and the spirit which animated the whole operated with magical force and established  a reputation which afterwards proved of infinite service  What contributed essentially to the success of the scheme was the assistance which Mr Lewis and Miss Ashmore rendered  The former was even at that early period esteemed one of the most promising young actors on the stage and had supported a variety of characters with the highest reputation  The latter I have already mentioned She was then an object of universal admiration and possessed the favour of the town in an eminent degree The new manager had the address to attach her to his party and she proved of infinite service to the cause A fortunate circumstance added Mr Wilkes to the number of favourites  Alarmed at the progress of this unforeseen danger Mr Mossop used every effort in his power to counteract it's effects  He brought forward those tragedies in which he stood unrivalled particularly his Coriolanus  with every pomp and magnificence He exhibited Catley in her Euphrosine which used to have such attraction He revived Woodward's popular pantomimes of Fortunatus and the Sorcerer and introduced in them the performances of Saunders on the wire and Lenomora on the rope but all with very little effect His expences were heavy his receipts were bad and his competitors gained ground though rather slowly  While matters were in this situation a circumstance occurred which decided the contest in favour of the new theatre  Bickerstaff's opera of Lionel and Clarissa was then performing with uncommon reputation at Coventgarden Relying on his own pieces and the plan he had laid down the evil genius of Mr Mossop prevented him from seizing the only opportunity which might lead towards retrieving his embarrassed circumstances  With Catley's fame and abilities had he first presented this celebrated piece to the public he most probably would have attracted to his theatre  that tide of success which his opponents so amply experienced  Not so Mr Dawson's discerning eye beheld the advantages in prospect He instantly set about getting it up with every care and expedition The d of April it was announced for the first time in this kingdom and on it's appearance received that stamp of public approbation it has ever since so deeply retained  Though Lionel and Clarissa is certainly possessed of great merit being an excellent comedy independant of the music which is in general a capital selection and though it stands deservedly high in the estimation of the sister kingdom yet was it reserved for the Irish audience to receive it with that enthusiasm and partiality which has ever peculiarly distinguished its representation in this kingdom  The Clarissa of Miss Ashmore according to every opinion was as affecting natural and interesting a piece of acting as had ever been seen and the Jessamy of Mr Wilkes was considered as the standard of excellence Every  other character of the opera seemed to be also well supported  The impression it made was extraordinary and the effects visible Whilst Mr Mossop with the strength of his company was exhibiting to orders or empty benches an early overflow marked every night this popular opera was announced  Some idea may be formed of it's power and uncommon attraction from the number of times it was acted Late as it was brought out it run twenty six nights and closed a season that will always be distinguished in the theatrical annal  of this kingdom  Mr Mossop when too late saw his error and endeavoured in vain to repair it In about three weeks after it's appearance at Capelstreet it was brought out at Crowstreet with this ridiculous distinction Jenny the Chambermaid Miss Catley the other characters by Mr Wilder Mr Duncan Mr Heaphy Mr Bannister Mr Remington Mrs Brown Mrs Hawtry Mrs Barry  It languished a few nights and was then cut down into a farce which compleatly finished it in the opinion of every one  The situation of the contending parties at the close of the campaign may easily be conceived With health impaired and circumstances much deranged Mr Mossop's prospects were of the most unpleasant nature Though the idol of the town as an actor and not censured as a manager a thing extremely difficult to avoid he saw himself deserted by that public to whose service he had devoted those abilities so much admired A striking lesson to every manager how little he can depend on that empty bubble popularity  Elate with their success the opposite party indeed exulted in the confidence of it's continuance Time will tell how far their expectations were answered  CHAP XIII  Next Season begins November    Mr Dodd Miss Young at CapelstreetMr Macklin dittoSmockalley opens under the Lord Mayor Mr Ryder returnsHis meritWest Indian produced at Capelstreet and at Smockalley The Belcour of Messrs Lewis and Mossop contrastedAnecdote of Mr Cumberland and the West Indian at Cavan  THE persevering industry of Mr Dawson seemed resolved to take every advantage of events so favourable He obtained possession of Crowstreet theatre abandoned by Mr Mossop and transferred from it the title of his majesties servants to that of Capelstreet  During the summer he also made several capital engagements In particular Mr Macklin Miss Young and Mr Clinch  However notwithstanding those great advantages it was rather late before either company took the field  Capelstreet was the first which opened with it's new title November th with the Beggar's Opera and the Anatomist The former presented no novelty in the latter Mr Dodd made his first appearance in Monsieur Le Medecin  This gentleman who has since distinguished himself in the literary world possessed theatrical abilities which if he had continued on the stage and cultivated would have gained him some eminence His Frenchmen were excellent and he displayed a good deal of merit in several other characters  In about a fortnight after Miss Young from Drurylane theatre who was then advancing fast to that eminence which she speedily attained and which she has since constantly preserved made her entre in this kingdom in Jane Shore Hastings Mr Lewis Dumont Mr Clinch Gloster Mr Dawson and Alicia Mrs Burden  Her reception was such as her merit amply justified flattering as her sanguine hopes could form and during the season she supported a capital line in tragedy and comedy with increasing reputation  Mr Macklin chose his favourite character of Shylock to receive the gratulations of his friends on his revisiting them which on his appearance they loudly marked  In the Merchant of Venice we find Mr O'Keefe's name for the part of Gratiano and speedily after in Filch Fribble Jessamy in Lionel in the room of Wilkes who had left the company Squire Richard c  Against such performers Mr Mossop had but little to oppose Smockalley was once more fitted up new painted and decorated as well as circumstances would allow and as the city theatre under the patronage of the Lord Mayor opened on the th of November with the tragedy of George Barnwell The hero of the piece by Mr L'Estrange from the theatre Drurylane of whom little could be said and a Mrs Day in the Virgin Unmasked  From this specimen much was not to be expected However as his great resource the  own was informed that Mr Ryder who had been absent from the capital for the last five years was again engaged and would speedily make his appearance  The interval of absence had been spent in the country of Ireland where he had conducted a company which during that time he managed with much credit and emolument to himself and his performers The towns he chiefly visited were Kilkenny Waterford Sligo Galway Derry Belfast c where the general business was excellent and the benefits lucrative  Mr Ryder on his return opened in Sir John Restless and was received by the audience with that warmth of friendly applause which ever marked his appearance  His presence was of infinite service to Mr Mossop's drooping affairs for though he was not able entirely to stem the tide of popular favour that continued to follow Capelstreet theatre yet he for a time upheld a cause which  without his assistance must have sunk under the pressure of accumulated misfortunes  Ever distinguished by the versatility as well as excellence of his genius Mr Ryder even then might be deemed a theatrical Atlas who at that time and for many years after principally supported the heavy burthen of the Irish drama This may easily be perceived by a review of the various characters he sustained during a period of eleven or twelve years when it might be truly said he was almost every night before the public  The favourite popular opera of Lionel was often repeated at both houses the early part of the season but Capelstreet still maintained the advantage although Mr Ryder was the Lionel at Smockalley  Miss Young and Mr Macklin were of infinite s  rvice to the cause they espoused The latter brought out his Love a la Mode and True born Scotchman with every advantage which capital acting aided by his instructions could give They were often repeated to good ho  es  The Romp in which Miss Ashmore obtained such reputation was first acted at this period and has continued to be a leading object in dramatic exhibitions ever since The comedy of 'Tis Well it is no Worse was also performed at this time  The same ability which had so eminently distinguished the Capelstreet manager last season was of infinite service during the present  Mr Cumberland had in the early part of the winter brought out his comedy of the West Indian with a success superior almost to any ever known Its great and extraordinary fame rendered it an object of the first magnitude to both theatres  Capelstreet however had the good fortune to produce it first to the public and it must be confessed with much greater advantage than it could be given by Mr Mossop  On Tuesday February th it was announced for the first time in this kingdom Belcour Mr Lewis Ensign Dudley Mr Clinch Stockwell Mr Holocombe Captain Dudley  Mr Kane Varland Mr Herbert and Major O'Flaherty Mr Dawson Lady Rusport Mrs Barry Louisa Dudley Miss Ashmore and Miss Rusport Miss Young  The same success which attended this excellent comedy in London pursued it here The public was charmed with a piece which with uncommon merit presented so amiable a portrait of an Irish gentleman and in Major O'Flaherty united the brave veteran soldier with the man of feeling whose heart was replete with the noblest impulses of humanity  And whilst they admired the piece they could not help ap  lauding the actors whose merits were never more conspicuous than in this comedy The Belcour of Mr Lewis has so often been the subject of panegyric that to mention it here would be useless Mr Dawson's Major Miss Ashmore's Louisa and Miss Young's Charlotte were truly characteristic  Such was its reputation that they had four or five crouded houses to it before it could be produced at Smockalley and then it did very little It was not the fashion and Mr Mossop  continued playing it to houses composed of orders whilst at Capelstreet there was an overflow every night  It certainly could not be necessity which induced Mr Mossop to attempt the sprightly elegant vivacious Belcour so totally opposite to his own manner But whatever was the motive it helped to give additional force to the finished West Indian of the other house and though Mr Mossop's merits as a tragedian were the universal theme of praise and admiration yet his warmest admirers could not but confess his great deficiency and total want of manner for this hero of comedy  At the time this admirable comedy was performing with the highest reputation in Dublin as well as in London the author happened to be on a visit at a Mr Cottingham's a gentleman of great respectability and fortune at the town of Cavan in the north of Ireland  At this very juncture a company of players happened to be performing there The news of his arrival being spread abroad it inspired them with the idea of seizing the golden opportunity  and whilst he remained in the country of performing his favourite comedy which from his being so well known and on the spot they judged would receive every support and encouragement from his friends  Full of this project they set about studying the parts with the greatest alacrity and the most profound secrecy and the poor author one evening had the unspeakable mortification without the least notice to find the comedy of the West Indian  "written by R Cumberland  Esq  "  and a long puff about it's success in London and the two houses in Dublin announced for representation the next night  This though not very pleasing he was not only obliged to submit to but was also forced to attend this very extraordinary exhibition  About an hour before the time of beginning a servant came to keep places for Mr Cottingham Mr Cumberland and a large party This news struck the company into the greatest panick They had not an idea of his coming to see them and almost petrified with fear that  single circumstance drove the little they did know entirely out of their heads  A little before the beginning Mr Cumberland and his party came into the theatre The appearance of it did not prepossess him much in its favour It was a temporary building as is usual in such cases erected in the town hall The stage raised two or three feet the audience part a range of seats divided by a thin partition into pit and gallery  In the front of the pit was Mr Cumberland seated the house crowded every expectation raised on high and all eyes turned on the author when the curtain drew up and discovered the manager seated for Stockwell at a table with a book of the play before him to refresh his memory in case of accident and Stukely waiting when casting his eyes on the author it effectually finished him  Had not Mr Cumberland been there he might in the theatrical phrase have bustled through that is he might have known the purport of the part and where the original language failed him substituted his own so that an audience  unacquainted with the piece could not easily perceive where he was at a loss but here conscious of his being deprived of that resource the little he did know his fear hindered him from recollecting and instead of several pages of description developing the plot of his marriage and the birth of the hero of the piece after a long pause he said  "Belcour is arrived"  Confounded at this unexpected speech Stukely after some hesitation replied  I believe he is Sir  Another long stand ensued when on popped Mr Barret well known in the Irish theatric world for Belcour  Now this gentleman though possessed of much merit in a peculiar line and an admirable figure for the Jew in the School for Scandal was by no means calculated in any respect to convey the idea of a young volatile elegant fiery West Indian  At the appearance of Mr Barret for this peculiar favourite of the author the whole house in spite of their respect for the writer burst into an involuntary and loud laugh which continued  for some minutes and served to increase the confusion of the actors  But Mr Barre  was very perfect and soon recovering himself the scene went on with tolerable composure till the appearance of Major O'Flaherty who as the company was rather thin was obliged to be doubled by the manager with Stockwell  This new and unexpected stroke produced another roar of applause and entirely completed the confusion and vexation of the poor author who unable to bear this cruel mangling of so excellent a comedy would have withdrawn but was prevented by his numerous friends many of whom having seen it in London and Dublin enjoyed the present representation with the highest pleasure The more laughable and ludicrous the performance was the more acceptable it was to them and the more they enjoyed it  Not so with Mr Cumberland his feelings were too much alive to be able to bear it with patience and heartily glad was he when the conclusion of the play gave him leave to depart  CHAP XIV  Continuance of the season    Cymon exhibited at both theatresMr Dawson's excellent generalship concerning itBrought out first at CapelstreetThe surprise occasioned by this Comparison of it's performance at each house Success of CapelstreetMr Mossop's embarrassment His illness and benefitIs obliged to relinquishCapelstreet managers take Crowstreet and perform thereMr Isaac Sparks and son Mr and Mrs JacksonMr and Mrs Barry at the latter seasonCloses August    d    BEFORE the West Indian had run it's career in Dublin Mr Dawson exhibited another stroke of generalship which deserved to be remembered Mr Mossop for above two years past had been preparing the town for the reception of his dramatic romance of Cymon which at  that time was very popular in London The scenes were painted the dresses made and the most splendid decorations promised  As the time approached for bringing it forward each newspaper was filled with paragraphs and encomiums on the excellence of the piece the beauty of the music and the capital manner in which it was to be exhibited At length the day was appointed for the performance of this long expected and much famed romance which was to be on Friday March th  On the Saturday night preceding this Friday Mr Dawson after the play was over at Capelstreet theatre stept forward and gave out for the Monday evening following the celebrated dramatic romance of Cymon with all the original music and entire new scenery machinery dresses and decorations and a grand procession of the knights of the different orders of chivalry  The audience were astonished and his own performers could scarce credit their senses But he soon convinced them he was in earnest for so complete secret and masterly were his  movements that not a single article was wanting in the various requisites  Without disclosing his design he had got a most capital set of scenes painted and had provided the different dresses which were made by Lupino tailor to the Opera House London The music he had got practiced and the principal parts studied under the pretence that after their opponents had played it a few nights as a first piece he then would bring it out as a farce In short a design so well concerted and which required so much forethought and address would have done honour to the first general of the age  On the Monday evening following March th Cymon was exhibited at Capelstreet theatre with a correctness and brilliancy which were highly creditable The scenery was beautiful and well adapted she dresses picturesque and according to the original models and the procession remarkably splendid and nouvelle All the performers without exception walked in different characters and upwards of forty supernumeries filled up the train in proper habits  The representation of this charming romance as might be expected afforded infinite satisfaction and when given out again was sanctioned by reiterated plaudits  This was a thunderstroke to the other party who beheld the hope of their long expected harvest so suddenly blasted and destroyed It was performed four nights before they were able to bring it out at Smockalley and even then though it was got up with great care and attention yet as first impressions are not easily erased the public were prepossessed in favour of Capelstreet and though it was often played during the season yet it never answered the expence and was afterwards reduced to a farce  In these contested pieces I judge that perhaps the reader may be interested more than in the common routine of business I therefore generally subjoin the support each received at their respective theatres  In compliance with this rule the following is the drama of Cymon as then represented     Capelstreet  SmockAlley  Cymon  Mr Mahon  Mr Ryder  Merlin  Mr Glenville  Mr Heaphy  Dorus  Mr Herbert  Mr Remington  Cupid     Miss Rogers years old  Linco  Mr O'Keefe  Mr Wilder  Urganda  Mrs Barre  Miss Shewcraft  Fatima  Miss Younge  Miss Mansell  Dorcas  Mrs Hoskins  Mrs Heaphy  Sylvia  Miss Ashmore  Mrs Browne  The Romp which has been already mentioned was also about this time exhibited in Capelstreet in which Miss Ashmore acquired great and deserved reputation These pieces with Mr Macklin's Love a la Mode and Trueborn Scotchman brought them through the remainder of the season The West Indian run upwards of eighteen nights Cymon nine the Romp six or seven the Trueborn Scotchman seven and the success which attended them  seemed to give the finishing stroke to Mr Mossop's management  Disappointed in his hopes harrassed by innumerable vexations and oppressed with debts he had not the least prospect of being able to discharge his spirits sunk under the pressure of such accumulated misfortunes and a severe illness prevented his appearing on the stage  Thus unfortunately circumstanced he was obliged to solicit the generosity of the public he had so many times delighted and in this distressed situation announced a benefit for himself in which he was unable to perform and in his advertisement "humbly hoped his indisposition would not prevent the attendance of his friends"  The benefit was fixed for the th of April when the comedy of Rule a Wife was acted The Copper Captain Mr Ryder Leon Mr Heaphy Margaritta Miss Mansell and Estifania Mrs Brown late Miss Slack with Cymon now reduced to an afterpiece  Though the house was very much crowded yet the receipts afforded but a temporary relief His affairs were so desperate that it was next to an impossibility for any immediate efforts to retrieve them  Much to the honour of the new managers they would not attempt to oppress a fallen enemy and therefore did not oppose the benefit by playing on that night The greatness of their success enlarged their hopes and Mr Mossop being obliged to relinquish Crowstreet theatre they took possession and removed thither in the month of March whither the favour of the town attended them with unabating warmth A few benefits were taken at Smockalley by the most capital performers and they closed early in May  Prosperity did not make the new managers of Crowstreet slacken their endeavours On the contrary the three kingdoms were explored for novelty They brought over that very excellent comedian and facetious companion Mr Isaac Sparks who after a five years absence made his appearance in John Moody  In May Mr and Mrs Jackson from the theatreroyal Edinburgh arrived The public were already well acquainted with the merit of Mrs Jackson late Miss Browne daughter of Mr Sowdon She had been absent near five years and appeared again for the first time in Polly a character which her figure and voice peculiarly suited Mr Jackson's debut was in Oroonoko  They were favourites with the town and played a variety of parts with much reputation  But the most acceptable present to the public was Mr Barry who now divested of his royal honours though not of his powers to charm once more moved in a private station  He was accompanied by Mrs Dancer now Mrs Barry who on the th of June played Rosalind a part she was peculiarly happy in Orlando by Mr Lewis Jaques by Mr Sowdon who was of his party in this expedition  A few nights after Mr Barry appeared in Jaffier when his return was welcomed with the most unfeigned applause  The remainder of the season was chiefly devoted to the tragic muse Mr and Mrs Barry repeated most of their favourite characters as Othello and Desdemona Lear and Cordelia Lord and Lady Townly Rhadamistus and Zenobia Alexander and Statira Lord and Lady Salisbury Varanes and Athenais Marc Anthony and Cleopatra Romeo and Juliet which closed the season August the third  Early in June Miss Young returned to England highly pleased with her trip in which she acquired a great portion of the two great essentials of theatric life fame and profit So strong and favourable an impression did she leave on the Irish audience that time has never since obliterated it and every visit which she afterwards made to this kingdom served to strengthen a prepossession founded on merit and aided by private character  A few nights previous to the conclusion Mr Isaac Sparks introduced his son Mr Richard Sparks to the public in the part of Lord Townly His youth and figure pleased much and a laudable partiality for the father made the town entertain hopes he would prove a valuable acquisition to the drama  CHAP XV  Burletta's performed at Ranelagh GardensMr Mossop's misfortunesGoes to LondonIs arrested thereAnother benefit for him at Smockalley Theatres opens November    th    Mr Lewis's rising fameMiss Ashmore's Success indifferentMr Whyte's young company  AS soon as the theatre closed a small party took possession of Ranelagh gardens where they exhibited English Burletta's two or three times a week for the remainder of the season  This party consisted principally of Miss Ashmore Miss Hawtry Mr Ryder Mr Glenville and Mr Atkins The Ephesian Matron was one of their capital exhibitions  The heavy hand of dire misfortune still pursued with unrelenting fury the unhappy Mr Mossop Recovered somewhat in his health he embarked for England and in London endeavoured to procure reinforcements for the ensuing winter  Hither his unrelenting creditors pursued him and a Mr Graham one of his own performers laid on the first arrest for nonpayment of salary due to him This arrest was speedily followed by numbers of others and he was confined in the King's Bench without the least prospect of relief  On every feeling mind his misfortunes made the deepest impression The public seemed much interested in his fate and lamented that a man of such genius should be so involved from a train of untoward circumstances in which his prudence could not fairly be impeached  Another benefit for him in Smockalley was fixed on by his friends previous to the commencement of the season when an occasional prologue was spoken by Mr Ryder who did every thing on  friendship could  suggest or the nature of his situation would admit of  The following advertisement appeared preparatory to the benefit  "The friends of Mr Mossop make no doubt that the lovers of the drama in particular and the nobility and gentry of this kingdom in general ever eminent for their encouragement of merit will exert themselves on the above occasion as Mr Mossop's case is peculiarly severe having at great trouble and vast expence during the summer made very considerable theatrical engagements in England for the entertainment of this city when on the very eve of his return to this kingdom to reap the harvest of his labours he met with the hard hand of oppression and that chiefly from people of his own profession"  The play was the Orphan and never was there a more crowded house The amount however was still inadequate to the end proposed and as there was a great overflow the play was repeated two nights after with this addition to the bills "'tis humbly hoped the nobility and  gentry will still exert themselves and bring to his native country one of the best theatrical performers now living"  But ineffectual were these wellmeant efforts of his friends His native country never beheld him more So great and various were his debts that after a severe confinement he was at last obliged to take the benefit of an act of bankruptcy before he could regain his liberty  Amidst these discouraging circumstances Smockalley theatre still kept open though with the utmost difficulty Mr Ryder had now an Herculean weight upon his shoulders A sinking theatre almost upheld it might be said by the single strength of his abilities  It is true Mr and Mrs Jackson in this exigence were of the highest service to the cause especially in tragedy They performed Romeo and Juliet Othello and Desdemona Tancred and Sigismunda and a variety of other characters  Mrs Ryder also came forward at this period and  Clementina Con  tance  Macbeth c  The industry of Mr Dawson and his copartners still seemed to keep pace with their success Though detained by various matters till it was late he in October set off for London after having given the necessary directions for repairing and new decorating the Crowstreet theatre  The principal object of his journey was to close an engagement with Mr Macklin with whom he had always lived on terms of strict friendship  The theatre opened on the th of November with the Provoked Husband and Devil to Pay Lord Townly Mr Sparks jun Manly Mr Heaphy Count Baffett Mr Mahon Squire Richard Mr O'Keefe Sir Francis Wronghead Mr Macklin Miss Jenny Miss Ashmore Lady Grace Miss Hearne Lady Wronghead Mrs Heaphy and Lady Townly Mrs Lee late Mrs Jefferies of Drurylane her first appearance with the Jobson of Mr Sparks and Nell of Miss Ashmore  Mr Sheridan was also engaged for six nights and played his Cato Hamlet Richard Lear c Much about this time Mr Vandermere a comedian of great merit made his first appearance on the Crowstreet stage in Lord Ogleby a character he sustained with much propriety and for many years after continued a great and deserving favourite with the town  It would be injustice were I not in this place to notice the rising fame popularity and superior abilities of Mr Lewis who though so very young gave every promise of attaining that dramatic excellence he has since so uniformly displayed At this time he supported a very extensive and varied line of business in tragedy and comedy with great ability  Miss Ashmore was also at this period a peculiar favourite with the public Each day added to her reputation Had she accepted of several offers made her from the London theatre at that time there is every probability that in so correct and improving a school she might have been classed amongst the first actresses on the British stage  In the following spring she married Mr Richard Sparks son of the celebrated comedian of that name  With so excellent a company it should seem an easy task to preserve the popularity they had already gained and yet so little to be depended upon is public favour notwithstanding every exertion and attention the audiences began to decline and the receipts of the theatre experienced a visible decrease  As merit is not confined to those of mature years it is but justice to mention a minor company of actors who at this time attracted the notice of the town  These were a number of young gentlemen belonging to Mr Whyte's grammar school in Graftonstreet a gentleman to whom the public are highly indebted for his judicious mode of educating youth and whose numerous pupils have since ornamented every liberal and exalted station in life  Under the tuition of so excellent a preceptor the young gentlemen above mentioned exhibited  the tragedy of Cato during the Christmass recess at the little theatre in Capelstreet with a propriety and strength of genius that would have reflected credit on the first actors on the stage  So uncommonly indeed did those junior performers distinguish themselves that at the request of a great number of the nobility and gentry who were present they repeated Cato a few nights after for the relief of the confined debtors in the several marshalseas the Marquis of Kildare the Earl of Bellamont and Lord Dunluce condescending to act as trustees on this occasion  Before I quit the present subject justice obliges me to remark that many are the obligations which the community at large owe to the labours of Mr Whyte  Intimately connected with Mr Sheridan thoroughly acquainted with his principles and mode of communicating his ideas on the advancement and perfection of the English tongue he  that time has I believe  understanding  the various beauties and critically reading writing and speaking the language than any other professional gentleman in the kingdom  Possessed of classical knowledge and refined taste the youth committed to his care amply reaped from his instruction every advantage which eminent abilities and judicious observation give and he has the honour of saying that many of the best orators in our senate and greatest ornaments of the pulpit and bar have received the early part of their education under his government  CHAP XVI  Mossop's misfortunes continue another benefit for him at SmockalleyDeclining state of the stage Mr Cumberland's comedy of the Brothers at both theatresThe Grecian Daughter at both housesMr Wilkinson once more visits Ireland his receptionMr Macklin returns to England with Miss Leeson  THE heavy pressure of adversity still with increasing rigour pursued the illfated Mr Mossop  On the th of January we find the following interesting intelligence respecting him in a London paper  On Saturday  night Mr Mossop appeared before the commissioners of bankrupts at Guildhall being the third meeting when he passed his examination and delivered up his effects which were about  l  in cash a  l  and a  l  bill his gold watch c when the creditors humanely gave him back the bills Gold watch c Mr Garrick attended and proved a debt of about  l  We are informed that Mr Mossop will soon make his appearance at Drurylane theatre in the character of Pierre  The latter part of the paragraph never took place Various and insurmountable difficulties prevented his ever again displaying to the public those abilities that merited a better fate  Mean time his numerous friends in this kingdom were far from deserting his cause Application was once more made to the public for another benefit Mrs Fitzhenry kindly offered her services on the occasion and played Zaphira in Barbarossa March the d  The emoluments arising from this benefit though considerable proved a temporary relief but were by no means adequate to the humane end proposed and he still was condemned to struggle with the rude gripe of adversity  The public now were with much reason heartily tired of the unceasing contentions excited by the different parties which produced no one good effect and of whose encreasing evils they saw no end many therefore of the most dispassionate and unprejudiced united in the idea of applying to parliament for establishing one theatre only A committee was formed and instructions given for preparing a petition and an advertisement was published inviting all such as were desirous of cooperating in so useful and salutary a scheme to meet at Bardin's hotel Collegegreen  Mr Sheridan also in a pamphlet published at that time which contained the purport of a speech delivered to a number of auditors at the Musichall in Fishamblestreet in a most judicious and masterly manner evinced the necessity of adopting such a measure  the only  of  restoring the stage to a proper degree of credit and respectability The meeting however was attended with very little effect a contrariety of opinions which could not be reconciled prevented the embracing so salutary a scheme  The established reputation which Mr Cumberland's West Indian had obtained rendered his next comedy of the Brothers a desirable object for both parties and another scene of rivalship was again acted over by the contending powers Each strove to bring it out first but on this occasion Smockalley produced it one day before Crowstreet  As it did not possess the intrinsic merit of the former so also was it's success proportionably inferior it was played ten or twelve nights at each without any reason for either to boast of it's reception or attraction Every exertion seems at this time to have been made by both managers with very little effect New and revived pieces pantomimes in every shape and form and all the various sources of dramatic entertainment were explored and exhausted to little purpose Novelty had lost it's charms variety it's power even the Russian dogs in a pantomime  and the Elephant introduced at Smockalley in the coronation in Henry the th on which "the champion made his public entry in armour of burnished gold" could not draw  At this unfavourable period was Mr Murphy's tragedy of the Grecian Daughter then in the very zenith of its reputation introduced on the Irish stage The uncommon success which attended it's exhibition in London had fully established it's character in the dramatic world and excited an earnest desire in the public to behold a piece of which fame spoke so highly  According to custom it was announced at both theatres long before there was any possibility of bringing it forward it was advertised even to the morning of the very day on which it was to have been performed at Crowstreet for the benefit of Mr Sparks jun when in the evening there was an apology made of the sudden illness of Mrs Sparks late Miss Ashmore who was to have played Euphrasia The play was consequently deferred  The next attempt was at Smockalley when after several  performed May  th for the benefit of Mrs Ryder who was the original Grecian Daughter in this kingdom In about a fortnight after Mr Dawson produced it for his benefit when Mrs Sparks gave an impression of this popular heroine with great truth of colouring and genuine touches of nature  Brought out under such disadvantages and so far advanced in the season it could not be expected to do much Hereafter with Mr Barry and Mrs Dancer we shall find it drawing large sums to the theatrical treasury  Much about this time Mr Wilkinson always attached to this kingdom which upon every occasion he celebrates for it  s hospitality and fond of a theatric excursion quitted for a short space his regal domains of York and Hull once more to visit Dublin Inclination led him to support the interests of Crowstreet induced perhaps by Mr Dawson who some time before in a tour through England had spent a few days at York and probably laid the foundation of the present engagement  Captain Ironsides in the Brothers and Major Sturgeon in the Mayor of Garrett both good copies of the originals were the characters in which he chose to renew his acquaintance with the Irish audience who received him with that cordiality and warmth his merit deserved  The very unpleasant situation of the stage at this time rendered Mr Wilkinson's stay very short in Dublin He remained about a month during which he played Colonel Oldboy The Upholsterer Lord Ogleby Shift Smirk and Mrs Cole in the Minor Cadwallader in the Author the Commissary his tragedy AlaMode Colin Mc Cleod in the Fashionable Lover and a few other of his favourites  The remaining occurrences of the season were but few Mr Macklin finished his engagement with Sir Paul Plyant and Love alaMode and returned to London taking with him his pupil Miss Leeson a young lady whom he first introduced on the stage at Crowstreet theatre early the preceding winter in Lady Townly with much expectation and who afterwards appeared not only in all his pieces but several other principal parts in comedy with success  This lady who several times since has visited Ireland is at present Mrs Lewis of Coventgarden theatre whose many virtues and amiable private character have justly endeared her to a numerous and respectable circle of valuable friends  CHAP XVII  Dramatic revolutionMr Ryder commences Manager of SmockalleyHis

stageLord Lieutenant visits SmockalleyCatley performs there Mr and Mrs Barry and Mr Aickin from Drurylane  TOWARDS the close of the last campaign a variety of circumstances indicated another theatric revolution which the summer recess forwarded and brought to a conclusion On the ruins of the present dramatic state of Smockalley  a new empire arose that flourished for several years and in the beginning promised a permanency which it never attained Mr Ryder had long been justly considered as the animating spirit that gave life and motion to the theatre he upheld it needed therefore but little preparation to dissolve the old government now too feeble to act with vigour and form a new community which by having so favourite an actor for their manager gave every reasonable hope of success  Spurred on by ambition unappalled by the numerous train of evils which had been recently experienced and which are in some measure the general attendants on dramatic dominion and not in the least intimidated by the perils by which his predecessors perished Mr Ryder assumed the reins of theatric power at Smockalley and made every necessary arrangment his judgment and prudence could dictate  It must be confessed the times held forth many alluring inducements to Mr Ryder to undertake so arduous and difficult a task as that of directing an Irish theatre The reduced distrest situation of the stage at Smockalley which  could not be supported under its present difficulties his being in the prime of life conscious of being capable of sustaining by the strength of his own abilities a varied and extensive line of business a great favourite with the public by whom he was urged to the present undertaking a tolerable knowledge of the theatric world which his late practice in that capacity in the country had improved and extended these motives were more than sufficient to excite in him an ardent desire to commence manager Hope pictured to his warm imagination a long succession of visionary bliss which he seldom tasted and enjoyments which fall to the lot of few managers  The summer vacation afforded excellent time for preparation The theatre underwent a thorough repair and received every embellishment it could admit of a tolerable wardrobe was provided a compact company selected light and not expensive capable of going through a good deal of business and which received a powerful accession in Mrs Sparks who then stood very high in public opinion and who was prevailed on to quit the adverse party  Every thing being in readiness as far as circumstances would admit Mr Ryder took the lead long before his opponent could draw his forces together and opened so early as Monday September with an occasional prologue after which was performed the same comedy that Messrs Barry and Woodward opened with  SHE WOULD AND SHE WOULD NOT OR THE KIND IMPOSTOR  Trappanti  Mr Ryder his first appearance in that character  Don Philip  Mr Sparks jun  Octavio  Mr Wilmot

house is fitted up and repaired in the most elegant manner and will be lighted with wax and as Mr Ryder has been at the expence of covering the benches of the pit with green cloth he humbly hopes no person will stand on them Ladies will be admitted into the pit as in the London theatres  "The scenery and decorations are entirely new painted by Messrs Jolly and Bamford"  From the above statement it may be seen that the first night promised but little yet novelty and that generosity which generally actuates the public mind on those occasions rendered the performance highly acceptable great hopes were entertained of success which were afterwards  amply verified and a succession of crowded houses gave a strength and stability to the new undertaking which were of the utmost service  The following list will convey some idea of Smockalley company at the time of opening  Mr Ryder  Mr Isaac Sparks  Mr Sparks jun  Mr Wilder  Mr Dodd  Mr Wilmot  Mr Waker  Mr Durravan  Mr Owens  Mr Stewart  Mr Kane  Mr Maher  Mr Hallion  Mr Brown  Mr Read  Mr Duffy  Mr Neill  Mr Garland  Mr Logan  Mrs Sparks  Mrs Brown  Mrs Hoskins  Mrs Barry c  To these were shortly after added Mr and Mrs Jackson Mr T Jackson a comedian of some merit from Bath Mr Parker from Edinburgh who made his first appearance in Ben in Love for Love and Major Sturgeon Mr Cartwright  on the musical glasses and several others whom Mr Ryder had engaged to join his standard  For upwards of six weeks Mr Ryder had the town entirely to himself an opportunity which he improved to the utmost During this time Mr Dawson was far from remaining an idle spectator He foresaw the impending storm and though he was not able to avert its fall yet he used his utmost endeavour to divert and break its force Notwithstanding every effort such were the difficulties he had to encounter that he found it impossible to open Crowstreet theatre before Monday November th when the West Indian and Midas were performed with not the most pleasing prospect of success  However what could be accomplished in such a situation he did An engagement with Mr Macklin and Miss Leeson was announced and early in the season he brought forward Mr and Mrs King from the theatreroyal York where they had resided several years much esteemed and great favourites Fame had spoke highly of Mrs King's theatric abilities In the York circuit she was esteemed equal to  any actress on the stage and from this extraordinary and general character Mr Dawson conceived that in his present exigence he had made a very valuable acquisition  Mrs King certainly possessed many requisites for the stage Nature had bestowed on her a tall commanding elegant figure with a face capable of exhibiting every discrimination of the various passions of the drama to these she added all the polished grace of action which a mind well informed could suggest Her voice and manner were in a great measure accordant to her figure strong and forcible but devoid of those delicate touches of nature which Mrs Barry had accustomed the Irish audience to  Her choice of a character was judicious Euphrasia in the Grecian Daughter afforded her various opportunities of displaying her figure and powers to advantage From her great reputation much was expected and though she did not entirely answer that expectation yet she proved a most valuable support both in tragedy and comedy to the cause she espoused during the remainder of the season Mandane Rosalind  Lady Townly Viola Sir Harry Wildair Beatrice c were amongst the many characters she performed  Mr King's abilities which were much more confined lay chiefly in the line in which Mr Lewis was so far superior that few opportunities occurred of his performing The ensuing summer they composed part of Mr Heaphy's company at Cork after which they returned to York where Mr Wilkinson received them with much pleasure For several years past they have been settled off the stage at Lynn in Norfolk with much credit and respectability  Mr Macklin and Miss Leeson followed Mrs King but though in great estimation with the town yet was their attraction over and as is often the case in theatrical affairs merit was obliged to give place to novelty however the arrival of the new lord lieutenant the Earl of Harcourt inspired them with fresh hopes which in some measure were gratified At the commencement of his vice regency he used every means to render himself popular and amongst others did not neglect that of courting it at the theatre which he visited once a week for some time  But to return to Mr Ryder the tide of success which continued to follow him with unabated force from his opening the theatre received an increase from the return of Mr Wilks the original Jessamy who after an absence of three years came forward once more in his favourite character and gave new fashion to this popular opera  Shortly after the Irish Widow then performing in London with much applause was produced at both theatres on the same night but with far different success Mrs Sparks gave such a captivating elegant finished portrait of the Widow Brady as charmed the public bore down all opposition and added much to her rising fame at Crowstreet it was only performed a few nights at Smockalley it was regularly presented every Wednesday for upwards of eighteen weeks to crowded houses  In this contest tragedy had its share of public attention at Smockalley where it was respectably supported by Mr Sheridan Mr Jackson Mr Ryder the most general actor in tragedy comedy opera and farce living Mrs Fitzhenry Mrs Jackson and Mrs Sparks  The favours he enjoyed seemed to quicken Mr Ryder's exertions and such a number of new and revived pieces were brought forward in rapid succession as evinced his activity and industry  A new comic opera called the Milesian written by a Mr Mc Dermot formerly a breechesmaker Jones was a bricklayer but at present surveyor of Dunleary was at this time produced but though it was well acted yet partly from the author's being unpopular it was obliged to be laid aside after the fourth or fifth night  A new comedy called the South Briton said to be the production of a lady followed but was not much more favourably received  Very late in the season the latter end of April Dr Goldsmith's comedy of She Stoops to Conquer was brought out at both theatres at Crowstreet on a Monday and at Smockalley the following evening but with no great success at either  At this period a gentleman made his first essay on the stage at Smockalley who deserves  to be particularly remembered This was no other than Mr Pratt then known by the name of Courtney Melmoth whose literary fame and various excellent writings will be remembered as long as a friend to humanity remains The part he chose for his appearance was Marc Anthony in All for Love preceded by a prologue of his writing spoken by Mr Ryder preparatory to his reception which was as flattering as he could wish  In a few nights after he repeated Marc Antony and in the remaining part of the season played Publius Horatius in the Roman Father Lusignan in Zara Lord Salisbury Jaffier and a few other characters His success on the stage though by no means equal to that in the republic of letters yet was respectable His figure was tall and genteel his deportment easy from his education and knowledge he could not but be a sensible speaker yet he wanted powers and force  At his benefit which was the Orphan in which he played Castalio he introduced Mrs Melmoth then in the bloom of life a beautiful figure with a remarkably sweet voice to public  notice In Monimia a part in which she succeeded so well as to give every hope she would prove a valuable acquisition to the stage Nor was the public judgment disappointed Mrs Melmoth's abilities are capable of commanding a respectable situation in any theatre  When the season closed Mr Melmoth led a company to Drogheda where he built a theatre capable of containing about forty pounds when much crowded it was opened with the Merchant of Venice in which he played Shylock and Mrs Melmoth Portia After an unsuccessful campaign of upwards of three months he was obliged to relinquish management and with it all idea of the stage This done he resumed avocations more suitable to his genius and from time to time produced a variety of pieces that did honour to his head and heart  To fill up the measure of success which marked this season we find what appears remarkably singular That though Crowstreet was the theatreroyal and consequently entitled to every mark of viceregal favour yet the lord lieutenant several times honoured it's opponent with his presence particularly to Mr  Ryder's Sir John Restless Mrs Sparks's Irish Widow and Mr Sheridan's Hamlet  In the month of May Miss Catley who had been absent three years returned to Smockalley with if possible encreased attraction and with "her native wood notes wild" once more charmed an admiring public She played Rosetta three times Polly once then took a benefit and finished with Ephrosine in Comus  This very long and successful campaign at Smockalley closed with an eclat equal to its commencement Mr and Mrs Barry in company with Mr Francis Aickin from Drurylane visited Dublin in the month of June  Owing to some dispute with Mr Dawson who was still in possession of the theatreroyal and who according to every information was unfairly or rather cruelly treated in the matter they performed a few nights at Mr Ryder's theatre but upon Mr Dawson's relinquishing Crowstreet they removed thither where they finished the season about the latter end of July with much advantage to themselves and emolument to the manager  CHAP XVIII  Mr Lewis engages at CoventGardenMr Ryder opens without

Mr Dawson's forcesConsequent close of his season  BEFORE the commencement of the next season the Irish stage was deprived of one of its greatest ornaments Mr Lewis whose attachment to Mr Dawson had hitherto prevented his looking forward to that situation which his  merit so highly entitled him to finding at length that he was not likely to profit any longer by his assistance listened to proposals and accepted of terms from Coventgarden where he made his first appearance in the character of Belcour in the West Indian on Monday October th  His success may be estimated by the honourable rank he has since sustained in the drama which certainly places him amongst the first and most finished comedians of the age The following critique on his performance that night which appeared the next day in one of the London papers is written with so judicious and discriminating a taste as to render it worthy of insertion It was as follows  "Last night was performed at the theatreroyal Coventgarden the comedy of the West Indian Belcour by Mr Lewis from Dublin being his first appearance on this stage"  "On his first entrance the agreeableness of his figure and the vivacity of his manner obtained for him that applause which an English audience is ever ready to bestow on the efforts of  genius Animated therefore by this reception it took off in a great measure that embarrassment which too generally clogs the powers of first appearances and left us more at liberty to examine his pretensions to public favour"  "His person we may pronounce to be a good stage figure rather above the middle size his voice clear articulate and commanding his deportment graceful and easy As the part of Belcour demands great vivacity and spirit Mr Lewis filled the whole of it with propriety judiciously steering between the pertness of the coxcomb and the dapper manners of low comedy so that on the whole we may venture to congratulate the town upon the acquisition of an actor who seems to be so able a successor to Mr O'Brien in the walk of genteel comedy"  I shall for the present take my leave of this gentleman with the following observation That as excellence of private character cannot be any disadvantage to eminence in public so does Mr Lewis enjoy as much as most men living the happiness that arises from being universally esteemed and such has been the peculiar rectitude  of his conduct that he has for years filled one of the most difficult stations in life to support with credit and has conducted himself with so much good sense and propriety as to defy malice to point out a blemish  To return to my subjectMr Ryder's prospects at this time it must be confessed were brilliant and such as might justify the most sanguine expectations The ill success of his competitor and his being though unjustly deprived of Crowstreet theatre rendered him at least in Mr Ryder's opinion no very formidable rival Accordingly after a few necessary arrangements he opened Smockalley theatre on the th of September with She Stoops to Conquer and the Miller of Mansfield  The favour of the town which so eminently distinguished his former season he continued to enjoy with undiminished force and the fostering hand of public patronage liberally rewarded his endeavours She Stoops to Conquer which amongst the benefits of last year had not a fair chance was brought out with great care pleased much and was generally played once a week Lionel and the Irish Widow continued still to  maintain their fashion and were played together every Wednesday for some time  Early in the season Mr and Mrs Miel from the theatreroyal Norwich made their first appearance in this kingdom the one in Archer in the Stratagem the other in Diana in Lionel and both with a tolerable share of success The abilities of the former in light comedy parts sprightly gentlemen and pert valets were far above medioSince that the public have had many opportunities of seeing him support a respectable line of business at different times  For some years past he has been manager of an excellent company who yearly visit Shrewsbury Gloucester Wolverhampton c  Mrs Miel possessed an excellent full toned powerful voice without much cultivation but capable of much improvement  Artaxerxes was revived at this time for the purpose of introducing Mrs Pinto late Miss Brent who had been absent eleven years in Mandane Her husband Mr Pinto led the band Yet notwithstanding her former high character  in the musical world at present she was but little followed and performed but seldom during the season  The Comedy of the Macaroni which I had written at York in the Summer of when I had very little knowledge of the drama but which from it's at that time popular title and a few other happy circumstances met with remarkable success in most of the provincial theatres in England was at this time brought forward and performed a few nights Whether from its want of merit or name never having been played in London or perhaps from both combined it was soon laid aside to make room for more popular and deserving pieces  Mr Ryder having concluded a treaty with Mr Foote this exotic arrived in November with Mrs Jewell then his principal actress and in high reputation and a Mrs Williams This accession of force did not much increase the receipts of the theatrical treasury They opened in the Maid of Bath which never had been acted in this kingdom it was repeated but with no great effect Mr Foote afterwards went through his usual routine of characters but still  under par His benefit The Bankrupt was however a good one  The latter end of November Mr Fletewood from the Haymarket theatre made his appearance in Tancred This Gentleman was of a good family and connections He had been some years an officer in the army where having dissipated a small fortune he embraced the stage as a pleasing and certain resource nor was he deceived in his expectations He possessed abilities which had he lived to cultivate would have ornamented the drama  During the season he played a variety of characters principally in tragedy with encreasing reputation On his quitting Smockalley theatre he engaged at Liverpool where he spent the next winter From thence he repaired to York where he experienced much kindness from Mr Wilkinson and the public Here his health began to decline and he died about two years after at Leeds esteemed and regretted  Mr Sheridan and Mrs Fitzhenry who had renewed their engagements with Mr Ryder were purposely kept as a corps de reserve 'till  the enemy who began to rally from all quarters and collect to one point began to grow formidable and make their approaches to dispute once more the dramatic crown with the present possessor  Though I have not had an opportunity till the present of mentioning Mr Dawson's operations for some time past yet he was far from remaining inactive during Mr Ryder's rapid advances His usual fertility of genius and industry employed each hour in making every disposition which the nature of his circumstances would admit  Counteracted in his views respecting the theatreroyal he once more had recourse to his fortunate theatre Capelstreet which on a former occasion had proved of such uncommon service This point settled he instantly set about repairing painting and decorating it with the utmost diligence  His company he had collected with every possible care and though they were not so numerous nor so high in general estimation yet were there many of approved merit and respectability  Several had deserted in the interim and in return several had been gained from the opposite party  From a variety of untoward incidents Mr Dawson found it impossible to open before Monday the d of November when the West Indian was performed in the following

warrant his entertaining any great expectation of success yet still hope did not desert him Every exertion possible he used to gain an equal share of public favour and adopted the principle of Portius in Cato  'Tis not in mortals to command success  But we'll do more deserve it  To form a judgment how far the new established company was entitled to the patronage of the town it is necessary that I

entrè on the Capelstreet stage in Sir John Melvil and Fanny Sterling in the Clandestine Marriage Their arrival was seasonable as Mr Dawson wanted numbers and the lady was capable of supporting  a very extensive line of business in tragedy comedy opera and farce  Mr Simpson was brother to Mrs Inchbald at present so celebrated in the literary world He was very young tall and genteel with a good face but not much accustomed to the stage or likely to make any great progress in a profession which requires uncommon endowments and which his own good sense long since pointed out the propriety of quitting Mrs Simpson formerly Miss George was on the contrary a most valuable acquisition with a delicate elegant figure but rather under the size essential for a large stage and a beautiful expressive countenance she possessed abilities which have since commanded the first situation in every theatre she has been in Towards the end of the season they accepted of an invitation from Mr Ryder with whom they remained some time  Amongst the number of new faces produced at Capelstreet a Mr Robinson deserves to be remembered This gentleman a native of Dublin enamoured of the drama commenced his career in Mungo in whic  himself with such eclat  to  resolution  he had taken In the course of a few years that he remained on the stage I had opportunities of seeing him at York and at Bristol a very valuable and respectable member of each community Since then he has thought proper to resume the line of life he was originally designed for the law and he now practices as a barrister at the English bar with reputation and success  In the unequal contest of this season Mr Dawson had to encounter many insurmountable difficulties with a small theatre inferior company and contracted resource  he had to contend against a great and popular favourite at the head of a number of excellent performers crowned with uncommon success and whose well replenished treasury enabled him to accomplish objects beyond the reach of his opponent  However that industry which characterized Mr Dawson's Management did not desert him at this juncture He got up the Jubilee with much care and cost in which he introduced Mr Astley and his performers then exhibiting in Dublin this drew him some money The  School for Wives then act  in London with success furnished another instance of his as  iduity he produced and played it at Capelstreet ten nights before Mr Ryder could get it ready In vain he advertized it in rehearsal with a promise of presenting it in the most perfect state the public embraced the first opportunity and it was of material advantage to Mr Dawson At length it came forward sanctioned by the Earl of Harcourt Lord Lieutenant when it brought seven or eight good houses The following is the manner in which it was filled at each house     Capelstreet  SmockAlley  Belville  Mr Lestrange  Mr W  lk    General Savage  Mr Mitchell  Mr Heaphy  Captain Savage  Mr Kennedy  Mr

army Miss Danby was afterwards Mrs Tyrrell  In the midst of this struggle whilst Mr Dawson was using every effort to maintain his ground he received an unexpected and undeserved stroke which sensibly affected his future operations a conspiracy of which he had not the most distant idea in a moment deprived him of eleven members of his community who without the least previous notice early one morning in the latter end of January set off in a body to Portarlington where with the assistance of a few others they formed a company and opened a small temporary theatre Though there were few amongst the revolters of any eminence yet the loss of such a number when he could ill spare one was a material inconvenience and naturally affected his future operations  What remains to be said of Capelstreet theatre at this time may be comprized in a few words Notwithstanding every effort which a fertile genius could devise or unremitting industry could effect Mr Dawson plainly perceived the absolute necessity of bending to the  and declining at least for the presen  opposition which he could no longer  upport with prudence He accordingly adopted the most eligible mode his circumstances would admit of He shortened his season considerably from his original intention commenced benefits directly and early quit the field to his more fortunate adversary  CHAP XIX  Mr Ryder's continued

stageThe latter seasonMr and Mrs Barry and Mr Aickin Mr Dodd and Mrs BulkelyMr Smith and Mrs HartleyTheir different success Review of the seasonConclusion  LET us now turn our eyes on Mr Ryder whose prospects each day brightened and whose views each day extended His theatre exhibited a pleasing busy bustling scene where crowded houses sweetened nightly toils and public patronage amply recompensed each well meant effort The Lord Lieutenant also frequently visited Smockalley and whilst his presence  added fashion to its circles increased his own popularity  The musical entertainment of the Deserter made its first appearance in this kingdom at that time and was most favourably received Its intrinsic merit pleasing music and the excellence of its performance entitled it to this reception Mrs Sparks's Louisa was much noticed Mr Vandermere's Skirmish added greatly to his reputation  Amongst the variety and novelty produced this season were the Sieur Powlaskie the Polander Monsieur Bissant on the Slack Rope and an animal company of performers consisting of three monkies a hare a dog and a horse who under the direction of the Sieur Mc Crowskie performed a petite pantomime but it must be confessed without any great share of public approbation on the contrary they were soon consigned to places better adapted to such exhibitions and obliged to give place to entertainments more suited to the nature of a theatre  About this time a number of gentlemen of the army and navy associated for the laudable and benevolent purpose of performing a number of plays and farces at Smockalley the emoluments arising to be applied to charitable uses For the benefit of the Meath hospital the Hibernian school the relief of soldiers wives and children c  The design which was truly noble fully answered each intent The first night of their performance was the Constant Couple and Miss in her Teens with an occasional prologue written and spoken by Major Riddisdale when the theatre was so crowded even behind the scenes that there was scarce room to get on or off and so highly in the opinion of the audience did these gentlemen acquit themselves in their respective characters that during a repetition of their performance for seven or eight nights the house was filled with rank and fashion The Stratagem was acted six nights The Devil to Payoften Amongst the gentlemen who distinguished themselves on this honourable and humane occasion was Major French whose theatric abilities stood the test of the severest  criticism His Scrub and Jobson will be long remembered as excellent pieces of acting  Mr O'Keefe the exuberance of whose fertile genius had several times before manifested itself in occasional jeu d'esprits and petite pieces brought out his Tony Lumkin in town for his benefit at this time This farce was several years after produced under the auspices of Mr Colman in the early part of his management at the Haymarket and though it was far from being the best of his performances yet it prepared the town for that species of dramatic writing which till then they had been unacquainted with  And here I cannot help observing the many obligations the public are under to Mr Colman sen for cherishing cultivating and directing a genius which has since added so much to their entertainment I think I can venture to affirm that to the great judgment of this excellent manager one of the best the stage could ever boast of in advising correcting and preparing Mr O'Keefe's first productions and in afterwards exhibiting th  perfection  we are indebted for a succession of many of the pleasantest pieces that enrich the drama  The popular dramatic romance of Cymon always a favourite was at this time acted with renovated strength Mr Michael Arne the composer of the music was at this time in Dublin and under his direction it was again brought out with great care and attention Much of the original music was restored several songs were new set Mr Ryder played Cymon Mr Wilder Linco Mr Mahon Merlin Mr Vandermere Justice Dorus Mrs Pinto Urganda Mrs Sparks Fatima and that elegant little warbler Mrs Arne formerly Miss Wright made her first appearance in this kingdom in Sylvia Thus powerfully supported it was highly received and brought several houses  Amongst the theatrical candidates of this time at Smockalley Mr Waddy distinguished himself so as to deserve particular notice His first character was Philotas in the Grecian Daughter His success in this induced him afterwards to attempt Dumont in Jane Shore the duke in Measure for Measure Menes in the new Tragedy of Sethona Cassius in Julius Caesar and several  others in which he acquired reputation and was considered as a promising actor  He continued at Smockalley for the remainder of the present and the whole of the ensuing season Hereafter we shall find him an active agent in the fortunes of the new theatre in Fishamblestreet  The success which Mr Ryder had experienced and the weight of public confidence which he enjoyed inspired him at this time with the idea of a new species of entertainment This was a kind of masqued fancy ball or ridotto  Crowstreet theatre had been shut up during the winter notwithstanding the earnest solicitations of several persons to have it opened But as soon as Mr Ryder had formed this new scheme he resolved to fit up this house for the occasion It was therefore immediately repaired painted and decorated for that purpose  This exhibition however appears to have suffered very considerable delays and to have undergone many alterations before it could be brought to  under the title  of a Fancy Ball and the plan proposed was by subscription There were to have been sixty subscribers at ten guineas a piece each subscriber to have eight tickets for the admission either of ladies or gentlemen  But probably from want of success in the subscription and finding the plan proposed not sufficient it was some time after changed The entertainment was then deferred 'till a later day and advertised under the name of a ridotto ball Tickets for this were to be had at a guinea each which in all probability was found a more productive plan than that by subscription  It was announced as under the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant and Mr Ryder had the address to engage the support of the Duke of Leinster the Countess of Shannon Lady Newnham and many others of the first rank Indeed the exhibition at the same time that it was a matter of pleasure proved also a scource of utility as every person who was admitted was to be dressed in Irish manufacture  The success of this project was such as might have been expected from the patronage under  which it was brought forward It took place some time in May The crowd of persons of fashion was so great that Mr Ryder was reported to have cleared upwards of a thousand guineas by the scheme  Much about this time we find Mr Astley and his whole family exhibited in various ways in Dublin Amongst the rest of his amusements Mrs Astley proposed to entertain the public by exhibiting a swarm of bees upon her arm so closely compacted as to form altogether a striking resemblance to a lady's muff With his usual activity Mr Astley had also a museum of curiosities going forward at the same time  To resist and in all probability counteract the influence of his exhibitions the royal forces besides tumblers and rope dancers received the powerful aid of a great little Phoenomenon called the Corsican Fairy The tragedy of Henry the Eighth was got up and in the coronation of Anne Bullen "the part of the Champion" is announced to be performed  by Maria Teresa the amazing Corsican Fairy who will make her public entry riding on the learned horse after which she will descend and move a minuet  and dance a new Corsian jigg upon a table This wonderful phaenomenon is but inche  high weighs but pounds and is allowed by all who have seen her a perfect beauty She speaks Italian and French with the greatest vivacity and elegance  However the lovers of  curious sights  might have been gratified by the appearance of this little lady it must be confessed the admirers of Shakespeare could have no great reason to rejoice at her introduction into one of his most celebrated tragedies But we must be at some loss in which point of view most to admire the ingenuity of the contrivance whether in regard to the happily suited figure of the chosen champion or to the appropriate nature of the exhibitions which he was announced to display A champion of inches high could at best inspire us with but little opinion of his prowess or dignity but we must utterly lose all sight of both when we behold him  mounting a table to dance a Corsican jigg  For the consistency of the proceedings as well as for the gratification of those cognoscenti who beheld this amusing spectacle it is much to be regretted  that the celebrated little count Borowlaski was not cotemporary with this lady to have joined both in the fight and in the dance The dignity of tragedy would then have been uniformly supported  Yet such are the wretched resources to which a manager is frequently driven not from choice but from necessity in order to counteract the rage of some similar attraction and to preserve public attention  However it must be confessed that the latter end of the season amply retrieved it's credit The number and excellence of the performers who were brought over was uncommonly great This will sufficiently appear by the mere repetition of their names They were Mr and Mrs Barry Mr Aickin Mr Dodd and Mrs Bulkely and Mr Smith and Mrs Hartley  Nor would it be fair to pass over in silence the merits of honest Bob Aldridge He also at this time visited his native country and during his short stay delighted his spectators with all the various excellencies of Irish grotesque dancing a stile of exhibition in wich he has never been surpassed  But of the several great names above enumerated the success was as might perhaps have been expected different The merit of Mr Dodd and Mrs Bulkely was universally acknowledged The first characters in comedy they had long supported with the highest reputation On this occasion however private considerations seemed to frustate public ability The connection between them was not of the most moral kind and some recent transactions had excited strong prejudices against them  They made their first appearance in Benedict and Beatrice in which notwithstanding their confessed merit they had the mortification to experience public neglect and inattention  Exactly in the same predicament stood Mr Smith and Mrs Hartley Their merits were considerable but their situations were nearly the same and their success was proportionate  Mr Smith was a gentleman of respectable family connections and education and of rising reputation in his profession His first character was King Richard Mrs Hartley was possessed of at least some of the leading requisites for  attraction She was of a lovely face and an excellent figure advantages which with the aid of novelty might have been expected to have proved successful But the fate of these tragic stars was not more auspicious than that of the comic luminaries already mentioned  Perhaps it might be owing to the superior attraction of Mr and Mrs Barry as much as to any thing else that these failures took place It has been always experienced that in Dublin but one object of favour can be supported at one time In this case it is not to be wondered at that the very superior abilities of Mr and Mrs Barry and their established same should have born down all competition  At all events such was the fact Their first appearances were in Lear and Cordelia two characters than which none I may venture to say were ever more capitally represented They were also very considerably supported in their several representations by Mr Francis Aickin whose abilities have always rendered him an acceptable visitor on those summer excursions  During the stay of Mr and Mrs Barry and Mr Aickin they performed most of their favourite characters and with a success which compensated for any other deficiencies The coffers of the theatre were amply replenished by their acquisitions  With such performers and with such eclat was the season of concluded on the th of July with the Grecian Daughter and Midas for the benefit of Mr William Barry treasurer  The review of this season will shew it to have been one of the most splendid ever known in this kingdom Whatever might have been the occasional struggles of the contending parties whatever the disappointment of some individuals the public cause was amply provided for The entertainments upon the whole were excellent and the emoluments of the prevailing party very considerable At no time has the town been presented with a greater variety of excellence at none has it more liberally rewarded it's providers  Upon the whole the season of may be said to have exhibited the Irish stage in a light of respectability which has been seldom equalled perhaps never excelled  FINIS
