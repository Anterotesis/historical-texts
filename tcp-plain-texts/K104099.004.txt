 A COLLECTION of POEMS  VOL IV  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN SIX VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed by J HUGHS For R and J DODSLEY at Tully'sHead in PallMall  M DCC LXIII  An ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD  By Mr GRAY  THE curfew tolls the knell of parting day  The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea  The plowman homewards plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The mopeing owl does to the moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtree's shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep  The breezy call of incensebreathing Morn  The swallow twittering from the strawbuilt shed  The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy houswife ply her evening care  No children run to lisp their fire's return  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Await alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye Proud impute to These the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn isle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze the genial current of the soul  Full many a gem of purest ray serene  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desart air  Some villageHampden that with dauntless breast  The little Tyrant of his fields withstood  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest  Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command  The threats of pain and ruin to despise  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land  And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes  Their lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd Muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to dye  For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries  Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely Contemplation led  Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded Swain may say  'Oft have we see him at the peep of dawn  'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  'That wreathes its old fantastick roots so high  'His listless length at noontide wou'd he stretch  'And pore upon the brook that babbles by  'Hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn  'Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove  'Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  'Or craz'd with care or cross'd in hopeless love  'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill  'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree  'Another came nor yet beside the rill  'Nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he  'The next with dirges due in sad array  'Slow through the churchway path we saw him born  'Approach and read for thou can'st read the lay  'Grav'd on the stone beneath you aged thorn  The EPITAPH  HERE rests his head upon the lap of Earth  A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own  Large was his bounty and his soul sincere  Heav'n did a recompence as largely send  He gave to Mis'ry all he had a tear  He gain'd from Heav'n 'twas all he wish'd a friend  No farther seek his merits to disclose  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode  There they alike in trembling hope repose  The bosom of his Father and his God  HYMN to ADVERSITY  By the Same  DAUGHTER of Jove relentless Pow'r  Thou Tamer of the human breast  Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour  The Bad affright afflict the Best  Bound in thy adamantine chain  The Proud are taught to taste of pain  And purple tyrants vainly groan  With pangs unfelt before unpitied and alone  When first thy Sire to send on earth  Virtue his darling Child design'd  To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth  And bad to form her infant mind  Stern rugged Nurse thy rigid lore  With patience many a year she bore  What sorrow was thou bad'st her know  And from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe  Scared at thy frown terrific fly  Selfpleasing Folly's idle brood  Wild Laughter Noise and thoughtless Joy  And leave us leisure to be good  Light they disperse and with them go  The summer Friend the flatt'ring Foe  By vain Prosperity received  To her they vow their truth and are again believed  Wisdom in sable garb array'd  Immers'd in rapt'rous thought profound  And Melancholy silent maid  With leaden eye that loves the ground  Still on thy solemn steps attend  Warm Charity the gen'ral friend  With Justice to herself severe  And Pity dropping soft the sadlypleasing tear  Oh gently on thy Suppliant's head  Dread Goddess lay thy chast'ning hand  Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad  Nor circled with the vengeful Band  As by the Impious thou art seen  With thund'ring voice and threat'ning mien  With screaming Horror's funeral cry  Despair and fell Disease and ghastly Poverty  Thy form benign oh Goddess wear  Thy milder influence impart  Thy philosophic Train be there  To soften not to wound my heart  The gen'rous spark extinct revive  Teach me to love and to forgive  Exact my own defects to scan  What others are to feel and know myself a man  EDUCATION A POEM IN TWO CANTOS  Written in Imitation of the Style and Manner of SPENSER's FAIRY QUEEN  Inscribed to Lady LANGHAM Widow of Sir JOHN LANGHAM Bart  By GILBERT

Muses  thine harmonious train  Who by thy aid erst humaniz'd mankind  Inspire direct and moralize the strain  That doth essay to teach thy treasures how to gain  And THOU whose pious and maternal care  The substitute of heavenly Providence  With tenderest love my orphan life did rear  And train me up to manly strength and sense  With mildest awe and virtuous influence  Directing my unpractis'd

Phaedîa  is a Greek word signifying  Education  PAEDÎA  's house  He his young Son conveys  Is staid by  CUSTOM  with him fights  And his vain pride dismays  A Gentle KNIGHT there was whose noble deeds  O'er  Fairy Land  by Fame were blazon'd round  For warlike enterprize and sage  Areeds  counsels  areeds  Emong the chief alike was he renown'd  Whence with the marks of highest honours crown'd  By GLORIANA in domestick peace  That port to which the wise are ever bound  He anchor'd was and chang'd the tossing seas  Of bustling busy life for calm sequester'd ease  II  There in domestick virtue rich and great  As erst in publick 'mid his wide domain  Long in primaeval patriarchal state  The lord the judge the father of the plain  He dwelt and with him in the golden chain  Of wedded faith ylink'd a  matron  sage  Aye dwelt sweet partner of his joy and pain  Sweet charmer of his youth friend of his age  Skill'd to improve his bliss his sorrows to assuage  III  From this fair union not of sordid gain  But merit similar and mutual love  True source of lineal virtue sprung a train  Of youths and virgins like the beauteous grove  Which round the temple of  Olympick Jove  Begirt with youthful bloom the  Parent tree the sacred olive This tree grew in the  Altis  or sacred grove of  Olympick Jupiter  at  Olympia  having as the  Eleans  pretended been originally planted there by  Hercules  It was esteemed sacred and from that were taken the  Olympick  crowns See  Pausanias Eliac  and the  Dissertation on the Olympick Games  parent  tree  The  sacred olive  whence old  Elis  wove  Her verdant crowns of peaceful victory  The  Guerdons  rewards  guerdons of bold strength and swift activity  IV  So round their noble parents goodly rose  These generous scyons they with watchful care  Still as the swelling passions 'gan disclose  The buds of future virtues did prepare  With prudent culture the young shoots to rear  And aye in this endearing pious toil  They by a  Palmer  pilgrim  The person here signified is Mr  Locke  characteriz'd by his works  Palmer  sage instructed were  Who from deep thought and studious search erewhile  Had learnt to mend the heart and till the human soil  V  For by coelestial  Wisdom  whilom led  Through all th' apartments of th' immortal mind  He view'd the secret stores and mark'd the  Sted  place station  sted  To judgment wit and memory assign'd  And how sensation and reflection join'd  To fill with images her darksome  grotte  Where variously disjointed or combin'd  As reason fancy or opinion wrought  Their various masks they play'd and fed her pensive thought  VI  Alse  also further  Alse through the fields of  Science  had he stray'd  With eager search and sent his piercing eye  Through each learn'd  school  each  philosophick shade  Where  Truth  and  Virtue  erst were deem'd to lie  If haply the fair vagrants he  Mote  might  mote spy  Or hear the musick of their charming lore  But all unable there to satisfy  His curious soul he turn'd him to explore  The  sacred writ of Faith  to learn believe adore  VII  Thence foe profess'd of  Falshood  and  Deceit  Those sly artificers of tyranny  Aye  ever  Aye holding up before uncertain feet  His faithful light to  Knowledge Liberty  Mankind he led to  Civil policy  And mild  Religion  's charitable law  That fram'd by  Mercy  and  Benignity  The persecuting sword forbids to draw  And freecreated souls with penal terrours awe  VIII  Ne  nor  Ne with these glorious gifts elate and vain  Lock'd he his wisdom up in churlish pride  But stooping from his height would even deign  The feeble steps of  Infancy  to guide  Eternal glory Him therefore betide  Let every generous youth  his  praise proclaim  Who wand'ring through the world's rude forest wide  By him hath been ytaught his course to frame  To  Virtue  's sweet abodes and heav'naspiring  Fame  IX  For this the FAIRY KNIGHT with anxious thought  And fond paternal care his counsel pray'd  And him of gentlest courtesy besought  His guidance to vouchsafe and friendly aid  The while his tender offspring he convey'd  Through devious paths to that secure retreat  Where sage PAEDÎA with each tuneful maid  On a wide mount had fix'd her rural seat  'Mid flow'ry gardens plac'd untrod by vulgar feet  X  And now forthpacing with his blooming heir  And that same virtuous  Palmer  them to guide  Arm'd all to point and on a courser fair  Ymounted high in military pride  His little train before he slow did ride  Him eke behind a gentle  squire  Ensues  follows  ensues  With his young  lord  aye marching side by side  His counsellour and guard in goodly  Thews  manners  thews  Who well had been brought up and nurs'd by every Muse  XI  Thus as their pleasing journey they pursued  With chearful argument beguiling pain  Ere long descending from an hill they view'd  Beneath their eyes outstretch'd a spacious plain  That fruitful shew'd and apt for every grain  For pastures vines and flow'rs while Nature fair  Sweetsmiling all around with count'nance  Fain  earnest eager  fain  Seem'd to demand the tiller's art and care  Her wildness to correct her lavish waste repair  XII  Right good I ween and bounteous was the soil  Aye wont in happy season to repay  With tenfold usury the peasant's toil  But now 'twas ruin all and wild decay  Untill'd the garden and the fallow lay  The sheepshorne down with barren  Brakes  briars  brakes o'ergrown  The whiles the merry peasants sport and play  All as the publick evil were unknown  Or every publick care from every breast was flown  XIII  Astonish'd at a scene at once so fair  And so deform'd with wonder and delight  At man's neglect and Nature's bounty rare  In studious thought awhile the Fairy Knight  Bent on that goodly  Lond  land  lond his eager sight  Then forward rush'd impatient to descry  What towns and castles therein were  Empight  placed  empight  For towns him seem'd and castles he did spy  As to th' horizon round he stretch'd his roaming eye  XIV  Nor long way had they travell'd ere they came  To a wide stream that with tumultuous roar  Emongst rude rocks its winding course did frame  Black was the wave and sordid cover'd o'er  With angry foam and stain'd with infants' gore  Thereto along th' unlovely margin stood  A birchen grove that waving from the shore  Aye cast upon the tide its falling bud  And with its bitter juice empoison'd all the flood  XV  Right in the centre of the vale empight  Not distant far a  forked mountain  rose  In outward form presenting to the sight  That fam'd  Parnassian  hill on whose fair brows  The  Nine Aonian Sisters  wont repose  List'ning to sweet  Castalia  's sounding stream  Which through the plains of  Cirrha  murm'ring flows▪  But This to That compar'd mote justly seem  Ne fitting haunt for gods ne worthy man's esteem  XVI  For this nor founded deep nor spredden wide  Nor high uprais'd above the level plain  By toiling art through tedious years applied  From various parts compil'd with studious pain  Was  Erst  formerly  erst upthrown if so it mote attain  Like that  poetick mountain  to be  Hight  called named  hight  The noble seat of  Learning  's goodly train  Thereto the more to captivate the sight  It like a garden fair most curiously was  Dight  drest  dight  XVII  In figur'd plots with leafy walls inclos'd  By measure and by rule it was outlay'd  With symmetry so regular dispos'd  That plot to plot still answer'd shade to shade  Each correspondent twain alike array'd  With like embellishments of plants and flow'rs  Of statues vases spouting founts that play'd  Through shells of Tritons their ascending show'rs  And labyrinths involv'd and trelicewoven bow'rs  XVIII  There likewise mote be seen on every side  The yew obedient to the planter's will  And shapely box of all their branching pride  Ungently shorne and with preposterous skill  To various beasts and birds of sundry quill  Transform'd and human shapes of monstrous size  Huge as that giantrace who hill on hill  Highheaping sought with impious vain  Emprize  enterprize attempt  emprize  Despite of thund'ring  Jove  to scale the steepy skies  XIX  Alse other wonders of the sportive shears  Fair Nature misadorning there were found  Globes spiral columns pyramids and piers  With sprouting urns and budding statues crown'd  And horizontal dials on the ground  In living box by cunning artists trac'd  And gallies trim on no long voyage bound  But by their roots there ever anchor'd fast  All used frequently by the old  English  poets for  allthough  All were their bellying sails outspread to every blast  XX  O'er all appear'd the mountain's forked brows  With terrasses on terrasses upthrown  And all along arrang'd in order'd rows  And visto's broad the velvet slopes adown  The eververdant trees of  Daphne  shone  But aliens to the clime and brought of old  From  Latian  plains and  Grecian Helicon  They shrunk and languish'd in a foreign mold  By changeful summers starv'd and pinch'd by winter's cold  XXI  Amid this verdant grove with solemn state  On golden thrones of antique form reclin'd  In mimick majesty  Nine Virgins  sate  In features various as unlike in mind  Alse boasted they themselves of heav'nly kind  And to the sweet  Parnassian Nymphs  allied  Thence round their brows the  Delphick bay  they twin'd  And matching with high names their apish pride  O'er every learned  school  aye claim'd they to preside  XXII  In antique garbs for modern they disdain'd  By  Greek  and  Roman  artists  Whilom  formerly  whilom made  Of various woofs and variously distain'd  With tints of ev'ry hue were they array'd  And here and there ambitiously display'd  A purple shred of some rich robe prepared  Erst by the  Muses  or th'  Aonian Maid  To deck great  Tullius  or the  Mantuan Bard  Which o'er each motley vest with uncouth splendor glared  XXIII  And well their outward vesture did express  The bent and habit of their inward mind  Affecting Wisdom's antiquated dress  And usages by Time cast far behind  Thence to the charms of younger Science blind  The customs laws the learning arts and phrase  Of their own countries they with scorn declin'd  Ne  sacred Truth  herself would they embrace  Unwarranted unknown in their forefathers' days  XXIV  Thus ever backward casting their survey  To  Rome  's old ruins and the groves forlorn  Of elder  Athens  which in prospect lay  Stretch'd out beneath the mountain would they turn  Their busy search and o'er the rubbish mourn  Then gathering up with superstitious care  Each little scrap however foul or torn  In grave harangues they boldly would declare  This  Ennius Varro  This the  Stagyrite  did wear  XXV  Yet under names of venerable sound  While o'er the world they stretch'd their aweful rod  Through all the provinces of  Learning  own'd  For  teachers  of whate'er is wise and good  Alse from each region to their  Drad  dreadful  drad abode  Came youth unnumber'd crowding all to taste  The  streams  of  Science  which united flow'd  Adown the  mount  from  nine  rich sources cast  And to the vale below in one rude torrent pass'd  XXVI  O'er every source protectress of the stream  One of those  Virgin Sisters  did preside  Who dignifying with her noble  name  Her proper flood are pour'd into the tide  The heady vapours of  scholastick pride  Despotical and abject bold and blind  Fierce in debate and forward to decide  Vain love of praise with adulation join'd  And disingenuous scorn and impotence of mind  XXVII  Extending from the hill on every side  In circuit vast a verdant valley spread  Across whose uniform flat bosom glide  Ten thousand streams in winding mazes led  By various sluices from one common head  A turbid mass of waters vast profound  Hight of  Philology  the lake and fed  By that rude torrent which with roaring sound  Came tumbling from the hill and flow'd the level round  XXVIII  And every where this spacious valley o'er  Fast by each stream was seen a numerous throng  Of beardless striplings to the birchcrown'd shore  By nurses guardians fathers dragg'd along  Who helpless meek and innocent of wrong  Were torn reluctant from the tender side  Of their fond mothers and by  Faitour  doer from  faire  to do and  fait  deed  com∣monly used by  Spenser  in a bad sense  faitours  strong  By pow'r made insolent and hard by pride  Were driv'n with furious rage and lash'd into the tide  XXIX  On the rude bank with trembling feet they stood  And casting round their oftreverted eyes  If haply they mote 'scape the hated flood  Fill'd all the plain with lamentable cries  But far away th' unheeding father flies  Constrain'd his strong compunctions to repress  While close behind assuming the disguise  Of nurturing care and smiling tenderness  With secret scourges arm'd those griefly  faitours  press  XXX  As on the steepy margin of a brook  When the young sun with flowery  Maia  rides  With innocent dismay a bleating flock  Crowd back affrighted at the rolling tides  The shepherdswain at first exhorting chides  Their  Seely  simple  seely fear at length impatient grown  With his rude crook he wounds their tender sides  And all regardless of their piteous moan  Into the dashing wave compels them furious down  XXXI  Thus urg'd by mast'ring  Fear  and dol'rous  Teen  pain grief  Teen  Into the current plung'd that infant crowd  Right piteous was the spectacle I ween  Of tender striplings stain'd with tears and blood  Perforce conflicting with the bitter flood  And labouring to attain the distant shore  Where holding forth the  gown  of  manhood  stood  The  siren Liberty  and evermore  Sollicited their hearts with her inchanting lore  XXXII  Irksome and long the passage was perplex'd  With rugged rocks on which the raving tide  By sudden bursts of angry tempests vex'd  Oft dash'd the youth whose strength mote ill abide  With head uplifted o'er the waves to ride  Whence many wearied ere they had o'erpast  The middle stream for they in vain have tried  Again return'd  Astounded  astonish'd  astounded and aghast  Ne one regardful look would ever backward cast  XXXIII  Some of a rugged more enduring frame  Their toilsome course with patient pain pursu'd  And tho' with many a bruise and  Muchel  much  muchel blame  Eft hanging on the rocks and eft embru'd  Deep in the muddy stream with hearts subdu'd  And quail'd by labour gain'd the shore at last  But in life's practick  Lear  learning  lear unskill'd and rude  Forth to that  forked hill  they silent pac'd  Where hid in studious shades their fruitless hours they waste  XXXIV  Others of rich and noble lineage bred  Though with the crowd to pass the flood constrain'd  Yet o'er the crags with fond indulgence led  By  hireling  guides and in all depths sustain'd  Skimm'd lightly o'er the tide undipt unstain'd  Save with the sprinkling of the wat'ry spray  And aye their proud prerogative maintain'd  Of ignorance and ease and wanton play  Soft harbingers of vice and praemature decay  XXXV  A few alas how few by heav'n's high will  With subtile spirits endow'd and sinews strong  Albe  although  Albe sore  Mated  amaz'd scared  mated by the tempests shrill  That bellow'd fierce and rife the rocks among  By their own  native vigour  borne along  Cut briskly through the waves and forces new  Gathering from toil and ardor from the throng  Of rival youths outstript the labouring crew  And to the true  Parnasse  Parnassus  Parnasse  and heav'nthron'd glory flew  XXXVI  Dire was the tumult and from every shore  Discordant echoes struck the deafen'd ear  Heartthrilling cries with sobs and  Singults  sighs  singults sore  Shortinterrupted the imploring tear  And furious stripes and angry threats severe  Confus'dly mingled with the jarring sound  Of all the various speeches that  Whileere  formerly  whileere  On  Shinar  's widespread champain did astound  High  Babel  's builders vain and their proud works confound  XXXVII  Much was the KNIGHT empassion'd at the scene  But more his blooming son whose tender breast  Empierced deep with sympathizing teen  On his pale cheek the signs of dread impress'd  And fill'd his eyes with tears which sore distress'd  Up to his sire he rais'd in mournful wise  Who with sweet smiles paternal soon redress'd  His troublous thoughts and clear'd each sad surmise  Then turns his ready steed and on his journey hies  XXXVIII  But far he had not march'd ere he was stay'd  By a rude voice that like th' united sound  Of shouting myriads through the valley bray'd  And shook the groves the floods and solid ground  The distant hills rebellow'd all around  "Arrest  Sir Knight  it cried thy fond career  "Nor with presumptuous disobedience wound  "That aweful majesty which all revere  "In my commands  Sir Knight  the voice of nations hear  XXXIX  Quick turn'd the KNIGHT and saw upon the plain  Advancing tow'rds him with impetuous gate  And visage all inflamed with fierce disdain  A monstrous GIANT on whose brow elate  Shone the bright ensign of imperial state  Albeit lawful kingdom he had none  But laws and kingdoms wont he oft create  And oft' times over both erect his throne  While senates priests and kings his  Sov'ran  for sovereign  sov'ran sceptre own  XL  CUSTOM he hight and aye in every land  Usurp'd dominion with despotick sway  O'er all he holds and to his high command  Constrains even stubborn  Nature  to obey  Whom dispossessing oft he doth assay  To govern in her right and with a pace  So soft and gentle doth he win his way  That she unwares is caught in his embrace  And tho' deflowr'd and thrall'd nought feels her foul disgrace  XLI  For nurt'ring even from their tend'rest age  The docile sons of men withouten pain  By disciplines and rules to every stage  Of life accommodate he doth them train  Insensibly to wear and hug his chain  Alse his behests or gentle or severe  Or good or noxious rational or vain  He craftily persuades them to revere  As institutions sage and venerable lear  XLII  Protector therefore of that  forked hill  And mighty patron of those  Sisters Nine  Who there enthron'd with many a copious rill  Feed the full streams that through the valley shine  He deemed was and aye with rites divine  The  Lacedemonians  in order to make their children hardy and endure pain with constancy and courage were accustomed to cause them to be scourged very severely And I myself says  Plutarch  in his life of  Lycurgus  have seen several of them en∣dure  whipping  to  death  at the foot of the altar of  Diana  sur∣named  Orthia  Like those which  Sparta  's hardy race of yore  Were wont perform at fell  Diana  's shrine  He doth constrain his vassals to adore  Perforce their sacred names and learn their sacred lore  XLIII  And to the FAIRY KNIGHT now drawing near  With voice terrifick and imperious mien  All was he wont less dreadful to appear  When known and practised than at distance seen  And kingly stretching forth his sceptre sheen  Him he commandeth upon threat'ned pain  Of his displeasure high and vengeance keen  From his rebellious purpose to refrain  And all due honours pay to  Learning  's rev'rend train  XLIV  So saying and forestalling all reply  His peremptory hand without delay  As one who little car'd to justify  His princely will long us'd to boundless sway  Upon the  Fairy Youth  with great dismay  In every quaking limb convuls'd he lay'd  And proudly stalking o'er the verdant  Lay  mead  lay  Him to those  scientifick streams  convey'd  With many his young compeers therein to be  Embay'd  bathed dipt  embay'd  XLV  The KNIGHT his tender son's distressful  Stour  trouble misfortune  c  stour  Perceiving swift to his assistance flew  Ne vainly stay'd to deprecate that pow'r  Which from submission aye more haughty grew  For that proud GIANT'S force he wisely knew  Not to be meanly dreaded nor defy'd  With rash presumption and with courage true  Rather than step from Virtue's paths aside  Oft had he singly scorn'd his alldismaying pride  XLVI  And now disdaining parle his courser hot  He fiercely prick'd and couch'd his vengeful spear  Wherewith the GIANT he so rudely smot  That him perforce constrain'd to  Wend arrear  move backwards  wend arrear  Who much abash'd at such rebuke severe  Yet his accustom'd pride recov'ring soon  Forthwith his massy sceptre 'gan uprear  For other warlike weapon he had none  Ne other him behoved to quell his boldest  Fone  foes  fone  XLVII  With that enormous  mace  the FAIRY KNIGHT  So sore he  Bet  beat  bray'd  resounded  bet that all his armour  Bet  beat  bray'd  resounded  bray'd  To pieces wellnigh riven with the might  Of so tempestuous strokes but He was stay'd  And ever with deliberate valour weigh'd  The sudden changes of the doubtful fray  From cautious prudence oft deriving aid  When force unequal did him hard assay  So lightly from his steed he leapt upon the lay  XLVIII  Then swiftly drawing forth his  Trenchant  cutting  trenchant blade  High o'er his head he held his fenceful shield  And warily forecasting to evade  The GIANT'S furious arm about him wheel'd  With restless steps aye traversing the field  And ever as his foe's intemperate pride  Through rage defenceless mote advantage yield  With his sharp sword so oft he did him  Gride  cut hack  gride  That his goldsandal'd feet in crimson floods were dyed  XLIX  His baser parts he maim'd with many a wound  But far above his utmost reach were  Pight  placed  pight  The forts of life ne never to confound  With utter ruin and abolish quite  A power so puissant by his single might  Did he presume to hope Himself alone  From lawless force to free in bloody fight  He stood content to bow to CUSTOM'S throne  So REASON mote not blush his sov'ran rule to own  L  So well he warded and so fiercely press'd  His foe that weary wex'd he of the fray  Yet  Nould be algates  would not by any means  nould he algates lower his haughty crest  But masking in contempt his sore dismay  Disdainfully releas'd the trembling prey  As one unworthy of his princely care  Then proudly casting on the warlike  Fay  fairy  fay  A smile of scorn and pity through the air  'Gan blow his shrilling horn the blast was heard afar  LI  Eftsoons astonish'd at th' alarming sound  The signal of distress and hostile wrong  Confusedly trooping from all quarters round  Came pouring o'er the plain a numerous throng  Of every sex and order old and young  The vassals of great CUSTOM'S wide domain  Who to his lore inur'd by usage long  His every summons heard with pleasure fain  And felt his every wound with sympathetick pain  LII  They when their bleeding  king  they did behold  And saw an armed KNIGHT him standing near  Attended by that  Palmer  sage and bold  Whose vent'rous search of devious Truth whileere  Spread through the realms of  Learning  horrors drear  Yseized were at first with terrors great  And in their boding hearts began to fear  Dissention factious controversial hate  And innovations strange in CUSTOM'S peaceful state  LIII  But when they saw the KNIGHT his fauchion sheathe  And climbing to his steed march thence away  With all his hostile train they 'gan to breathe  With freer spirit and with aspect gay  Soon chaced the gathering clouds of black affray  Alse their great monarch cheared with the view  Of myriads who confess his sov'ran sway  His ruffled pride began to plume anew  And on his bugle clear a strain of triumph blew  LIV  Thereat the multitude that stood around  Sent up at once a universal roar  Of boisterous joy the suddenbursting sound  Like the explosion of a warlike store  Of nitrous grain th' afflicted  Welkin  sky  welkin tore  Then turning towards the KNIGHT with scoffings lewd  Heartpiercing insults and revilings sore  Loud bursts of laughter vain and hisses rude  As through the throng he pass'd his parting steps pursued  LV  Alse from that  forked hill  the boasted seat  Of studious  Peace  and mild  Philosophy  Indignant murmurs mote be heard to threat  Mustering their rage eke baleful  Infamy  Rouz'd from her den of base obscurity  By those same  Maidens Nine  began to sound  Her brazen trump of black'ning obloquy  While  Satire  with dark clouds encompast round  Sharp secret arrows shot and aim'd his back to wound  LVI  But the brave FAIRY KNIGHT no whit dismay'd  Held on his peaceful journey o'er the plain  With curious eye observing as he stray'd  Through the wide provinces of CUSTOM'S reign  What mote afresh admonish him remain  Fast by his virtuous purpose all around  So many objects mov'd his just disdain  Him seem'd that nothing serious nothing sound  In city village bow'r or castle mote be found  LVII  In village city castle bow'r and hall  Each sex each age each order and degree  To vice and idle sport abandon'd all  Kept one perpetual general jubilee  Ne suffer'd ought disturb their merry glee  Ne sense of private loss ne publick woes  Restraint of law Religion's drad decree  Intestine desolation foreign foes  Nor heav'n's tempestuous threats nor earth's convulsive throws  LVIII  But chiefly they whom Heav'n's disposing hand  Had seated high on Fortune's upper stage  And plac'd within their call the sacred band  That waits on Nature and Instruction sage  If happy their wife  Hests behests  precepts commands  hests mote them engage  To climb through knowledge to more noble praise  And as they mount enlighten every age  With the bright influence of fair Virtue's rays  Which from the aweful heights of Grandeur brighter blaze  LIX  They O perverse and base ingratitude  Despising the great ends of Providence  For which above their mates they were endued  With health authority and eminence  To the low services of brutal sense  Abused the means of pleasures more refin'd  Of knowledge virtue and beneficence  And fettering on her throne th' immortal mind  The guidance of her realm to passions wild resign'd  LX  Hence thoughtless shameless reckless spiritless  Nought worthy of their kind did they assay  But or benumb'd with palsied Idleness  In meerly living loiter'd life away  Or by false taste of pleasure led astray  Forever wand'ring in the sensual bow'rs  Of feverish Debauch and lustful Play  Spent on ignoble toils their active pow'rs  And with untimely blasts diseas'd their vernal hours  LXI  Ev'n they to whom kind Nature did accord  A frame more delicate and purer mind  Through the foul brothel and the winestain'd board  Of beastly  Comus  loathing they declin'd  Yet their soft hearts to idle joys resign'd  Like painted insects through the summerair  With random flight aye ranging unconfin'd  And tasting every flower and blossom fair  Withouten any choice withouten any care  LXII  For choice them needed none who only sought  With vain amusements to beguile the day  And wherefore should they take or care or thought  Whom Nature prompts and Fortune calls to play  "Lords of the earth be happy as ye may"  So learn'd so taught the leaders of mankind  Th' unreasoning vulgar willingly obey  And leaving toil and poverty behind  Ran forth by different ways the blissful boon to find  LXIII  Nor tedious was the search for every where  As nigh great CUSTOM'S royal tow'rs the KNIGHT  Pass'd through th' adjoining hamlets mote he hear  The merry voice of festival Delight  Saluting the return of morning bright  With matinrevels by the midday hours  Scarce ended and again with dewy night  In cover'd theatres or leafy bow'rs  Offering her eveningvows to  Pleasure's  joyous pow'rs  LXIV  And ever on the way mote he espy  Men women children a promiscuous throng  Of rich poor wise and simple low and high  By land by water passing aye along  With mummers anticks musick dance and song  To  Pleasure's  numerous temples that beside  The glistening streams or tufted groves among  To every idle foot stood open wide  And every gay desire with various joys supplied  LXV  For there each heart with diverse charms to move  The sly inchantress summoned all her train  Alluring  Venus  queen of fragrant love  The boon companion  Bacchus  loud and vain  And tricking  Hermes  god of fraudful gain  Who when blind  Fortune  throws directs the die  And  Phoebus  tuning his soft  Lydian  strain  To wanton motions and the lover's sigh  And thoughtbeguiling shew and masking revelry  LXVI  Unmeet associates there for noble youth  Who to true honour meaneth to aspire  And for the works of virtue faith and truth  Would keep his manly faculties entire  The which avizing well the cautious fire  From that soft  siren land  of  Pleasaunce  vain  With timely haste was minded to retire  Or ere  before  Or ere the sweet contagion mote attain  His son's unpractic'd heart yet free from vicious stain  LXVII  So turning from that beaten road aside  Through many a devious path at length he paced  As that experienc'd  Palmer  did him guide  'Till to a mountain hoare they come at last  Whose highrais'd brows with silvan honours graced  Majestically frown'd upon the plain  And over all an aweful horrour cast  Seem'd as those villas gay it did disdain  Which spangled all the vale like  Flora's  painted train  LXVIII  The hill ascended strait erewhile they came  To a tall grove whose thickembow'ring shade  Impervious to the sun's meridian flame  Ev'n at midnoon a dubious twilight made  Like to that sober light which disarray'd  Of all its gorgeous robe with blunted beams  Through windows dim with holy acts pourtray'd  Along some cloister'd abby faintly gleams  Abstracting the rapt thought from vain earthmusing themes  LXIX  Beneath this high o'erarching canopy  Of clust'ring oaks a silvan colonnade  Aye list'ning to the native melody  Of birds sweetechoing through the lonely shade  On to the centre of the grove they stray'd  Which in a spacious circle opening round  Within it's shelt'ring arms securely laid  Disclos'd to sudden view a vale profound  With Nature's artless smiles and tranquil beauties crown'd  LXX  There on the basis of an ancient pile  Whose cross surmounted spire o'erlook'd the wood  A venerable MATRON they erewhile  Discover'd have beside a murm'ring flood  Reclining in right sad and pensive mood  Retir'd within her own abstracted breast  She seem'd o'er various woes by turns to brood  The which her changing chear by turns exprest  Now glowing with disdain with grief now  Overkest  for overcast  overkest  LXXI  Her thus immers'd in anxious thought profound  Whenas the  Knight  perceiv'd he nearer drew  To weet what bitter bale did her astound  And whence th' occasion of her anguish grew  For that right noble MATRON well he knew  And many perils huge and labours sore  Had for her sake endured her vassal true  Train'd in her love and practiced evermore  Her honour to respect and reverence her lore  LXXII  O dearest drad he cried fair  island queen  Mother of heroes  empress  of the  main  What means that stormy brow of troublous teen  Sith  since  Sith heav'nborn  Peace  with all her smiling train  Of sciences and arts adorns thy reign  With wealth and knowledge splendour and renown  Each port how throng'd how fruitful every plain  How blithe the country and how gay the town  While  Liberty  secures and heightens every boon  LXXIII  Awaken'd from her trance of pensive woe  By these fair flattering words she rais'd her head  And bending on the KNIGHT her frowning brow  Mock'st thou my sorrows  Fairy Son  she said  Or is thy judgment by thy heart misled  To deem that certain which thy hopes suggest  To deem them full of life and  Lustihead  strong health vigour  lustihead  Whose cheeks in  Hebe  's vivid tints are drest  And with  Joy  's careless mien and dimpled smiles imprest  LXXIV  Thy unsuspecting heart how nobly good  I know how sanguine in thy country's cause  And mark'd thy virtue singly how it stood  Th' assaults of mighty CUSTOM which o'erawes  The faint and timorous mind and oft withdraws  From  Reason  's lore th' ambitious and the vain  By the sweet lure of popular applause  Against their better knowledge to maintain  The lawless throne of  Vice  or  Folly  's childish reign  LXXV  How vast his influence how wide his sway  Thy self erewhile by proof didst understand  And saw'st as through his realms thou took'st thy way  How  Vice  and  Folly  had o'erspread the land  And can'st thou then O  Fairy  's  Son  demand  The reason of my woe or hope to ease  The throbbings of my heart with speeches bland  And words more apt my sorrows to increase  The oncedear names of  Wealth  and  Liberty  and  Peace  LXXVI  Peace Wealth  and  Liberty  that noblest boon  Are blessings only to the  wise  and  good  To weak and vicious minds their worth unknown  And thence abused but serve to furnish food  For riot and debauch and fire the blood  With highspiced luxury whence strife debate  Ambition envy Faction's vip'rous brood  Contempt of order manners profligate  The symptoms of a foul diseased and bloated state  LXXVII  Ev'n  Wit  and  Genius  with their learned train  Of Arts and Muses though from heav'n above  Descended when their talents they prophane  To varnish folly kindle wanton love  And aid excentrick sceptic  Pride  to rove  Beyond  coelestial Truth  's attractive sphere  This  moral system's central sun  aye prove  To their fond votaries a curse severe  And only make mankind more obstinately err  LXXVIII  And stand my sons herein from censure clear  Have They consider'd well and understood  The use and import of those blessings dear  Which the great  Lord of Nature  hath bestow'd  As well to prove as to reward the good  Whence are these torrents then these billowy seas  Of vice in which as in his proper flood  The fell  leviathan  licentious plays  And upon shipwreck'd faith and sinking virtue preys  LXXIX  To you ye Noble Opulent and Great  With friendly voice I call and honest zeal  Upon your vital influences wait  The health and sickness of the commonweal  The maladies you cause yourselves must heal  In vain to the unthinking harden'd crowd  Will  Truth  and  Reason  make their just appeal  In vain will  sacred Wisdom  cry aloud  And  Justice  drench in vain her vengeful sword in blood  LXXX  With You must reformation first take place  You are the head the intellectual mind  Of this vast body politick whose base  And vulgar limbs to drudgery consign'd  All the rich stores of Science have resign'd  To You that by the craftsman's various toil  The seaworn mariner and sweating hind  In peace and affluence maintain'd the while  You for yourselves and them may dress the mental soil  LXXXI  Bethink you then my children of the trust  In you repos'd ne let your heav'nborn mind  Consume in pleasure or unactive rust  But nobly rouse you to the task assign'd  The godlike task to teach and mend mankind  Learn that ye may instruct to virtue lead  Yourselves the way the herd will crowd behind  And gather precepts from each worthy deed  "Example is a lesson that all men can read  LXXXII  But if to All or Most I do not speak  In vain and sensual habits now grown old  The strong  Circaean charm  you cannot break  Nor reassume at will your native  Mould  shape form  mould  Yet envy not the state you could not hold  And take compassion on the rising age  In them redeem your errours manifold  And by due discipline and nurture sage  In Virtue's lore betimes your docile sons engage  LXXXIII  You chiefly who like me in secret mourn  The prevalence of CUSTOM lewd and vain  And you who though by the rude torrent borne  Unwillingly along you yield with pain  To his behests and act what you disdain  Yet nourish in your hearts the gen'rous love  Of piety and truth no more restrain  The manly zeal but all your sinews move  The present to reclaim the future race improve  LXXXIV  Eftsoons by your joint efforts shall be quell'd  Yon haughty GIANT who so proudly sways  A sceptre by repute alone upheld  Who where he cannot dictate strait obeys  Accustom'd to conform his flattering phrase  To numbers and highplac'd authority  Your party he will join your maxims praise  And drawing after all his menial fry  Soon teach the general voice your act to ratify  LXXXV  Ne for th' atchievement of this great emprize  The want of means or counsel may ye dread  From my TWINDAUGHTERS' fruitful wombs shall rise  A race of letter'd sages deeply read  In  Learning  's various writ by whom yled  Through each well cultur'd plot each beauteous grove  Where  antique Wisdom  whilom wont to tread  With mingled glee and profit may ye rove  And cull each virtuous plant each tree of knowledge prove  LXXXVI  Yourselves with virtue thus and knowledge fraught  Of what in ancient days of good or great  Historians bards philosophers have taught  Join'd with whatever else of modern date  Maturer judgment search more accurate  Discover'd have of Nature Man and God  May by new laws reform the timeworn state  Of cellbred discipline and smoothe the road  That leads through  Learning  's vale to  Wisdom  's bright abode  LXXXVII  By you invited to her secret bow'rs  Then shall PAEDÎA reascend her throne  With vivid laurels girt and fragrant flow'rs  While from their  forked mount  descending down  Yon supercilious  pedant train  shall own  Her empire paramount ere long by Her  Ytaught a lesson in their schools unknown  "To  Learning  's richest treasures to prefer  "The  knowledge  of the  world  and  man's great business there  LXXXVIII  On this prime science as the final end  Of all her discipline and nurturing care  Her eye PAEDÎA fixing aye shall bend  Her every thought and effort to prepare  Her tender pupils for the various war  Which  Vice  and  Folly  shall upon them wage  As on the perilous march of life they fare  With prudent lore forearming every age  Gain'st  Pleasure  's treacherous joys and  Pain  's embattled rage  LXXXIX  Then shall my youthful sons to Wisdom led  By fair example and ingenuous praise  With willing feet the paths of  Duty  tread  Through the world's intricate or rugged ways  Conducted by  Religion  's sacred rays  Whose soulinvigorating influence  Shall purge their minds from all impure allays  Of sordid selfishness and brutal sense  And swell th' ennobled heart with blest benevolence  XC  Then also shall this  emblematick pile  By  magick  whilom fram'd to sympathize  With all the fortunes of this changeful isle  Still as my sons in fame and virtue rise  Grow with their growth and to th' applauding skies  It's radiant cross uplift the while to grace  The  multiplying niches  fresh supplies  Of  worthies  shall succeed with equal pace  Aye following their  sires  in virtue's glorious race  XCI  Fir'd with th' idea of her future fame  She rose majestick from her lowly sted  While from her vivid eyes a sparkling flame  Outbeaming with unwonted light o'erspread  That  monumental pile  and as her head  To every  front  she turn'd discover'd round  The venerable  forms  of heroes dead  Who for their various merit erst renown'd  In this bright fane of glory shrines of honour found  XCII  On  these  that  royal dame  her ravish'd eyes  Would often feast and ever as she spy'd  Forth from the ground the  length'ning structure  rise  With  newplac'd statues  deck'd on every side  Her parentbreast would swell with gen'rous pride  And now with her in that sequester'd plain  The  Knight  awhile constraining to abide  She  to the  Fairy Youth  with pleasure fain  Those  sculptur'd chiefs  did shew and their great lives explain  Great lives explain  I cannot forbear taking occasion from these words to make my acknowledgements to the writers of  Biographia Britannica  for the pleasure and profit I have lately received from perusing the two first volumes of that useful and entertaining work of which the  monumental structure  abovementioned decorated with the statues of  great  and  good  men is no improper emblem This work which contains the  lives of the most eminent persons who have flourished in  Great Britain  and  Ireland  from the earliest ages down to the present time  appears to me as far as it has hitherto gone to be executed with great  spirit accuracy  and  judgment  and deserves in my opinion to be encouraged by all who have at heart the honour of their country and that of their particular families and friends and who can any ways assist the ingenious and laborious authors to render as perfect as possible a design so apparently calculated to serve the publick by setting in the truest and fullest light the characters of persons al∣ready generally though perhaps too indistinctly known and re∣trieving from obscurity and oblivion examples of private and retired merit which though less glaring and ostentatious than the former are not however of a less extensive or less bene∣ficial influence To those who may happen not to have seen this repository of  British  glory I cannot give a better idea of it than in the following lines of  Virgil  Hic manus  ob patriam pugnando  vulnera passi  Quique  sacerdotes  casti dum vita manebat  Quique pii  vates    Phoebo digna  locuti  Inventas  aut qui  vitam excoluere  per  artes  Quique  sui memores  alios fecere  merendo  Virg Aen L    The End of the FIRST CANTO  PENSHURST INSCRIBED TO WILLIAM PERRY  Esq  AND The Honourable Mrs ELIZABETH PERRY  By the late Mr F COVENTRY  GENIUS of Penshurst old  Who saw'st the birth of each immortal oak  Here sacred from the stroke  And all thy tenants of yon turrets bold  Inspir'st to arts or arms  Where  Sir  Philip Sidney  Sidney his Arcadian landscape drew  Genuine from thy Doric view  And patriot  Algernon Sidney  Algernon unshaken rose  Above insulting foes  And Saccharissa nurs'd her angel charms  O suffer me with sober tread  To enter on thy holy shade  Bid smoothlygliding Medway stand  And wave his sedgy tresses bland  A stranger let him kindly greet  And pour his urn beneath my feet  And see where Perry opes his door  To land me on the social floor  Nor does the heiress of these shades deny  To bend her bright majestic eye  Where Beauty shines and Friendship warm  And Honour in a female form  With them in aged groves to walk  And lose my thoughts in artless talk  I shun the voice of Party loud  I shun loose Pleasure's idle crowd  And monkish academic cell  Where Science only feigns to dwell  And court where speckled Vanity  Apes her tricks in tawdry die  And shifts each hour her tinsel hue  Still furbelow'd in follies new  Here Nature no distortion wears  Old Truth retains his silver hairs  And Chastity her matron step  And purple Health her rosy lip  Ah on the virgin's gentle brow  How Innocence delights to glow  Unlike the towndame's haughty air  The scornful eye and harlot's stare  But bending mild the bashful front  As modest Fear is ever wont  Shepherdesses such of old  Doric bards enamour'd told  While the pleas'd Arcadian vale  Echo'd the enchanting tale  But chief of Virtue's lovely train  A pensive exile on the plain  No longer active now to wield  Th' avenging sword protecting shield  Here thoughtfulwalking Liberty  Remembers Britons once were free  With her would Nobles old converse  And learn her dictates to rehearse  Ere yet they grew refin'd to hate  The hospitable rural seat  The spacious hall with tenants stor'd  Where Mirth and Plenty crown'd the board  Ere yet their  Lares  they forsook  And lost the genuine British look  The conscious brow of inward merit  The rough unbending martial spirit  To clink the chain of Thraldom gay  And courtidolatry to pay  To live in city smoaks obscure  Where morn ne'er wakes her breezes pure  Where darkest midnight reigns at noon  And fogs eternal blot the sun  But come the minutes flit away  And eager Fancy longs to stray  Come friendly Genius lead me round  Thy sylvan haunts and magic ground  Point every spot of hill or dale  And tell me as we tread the vale  "Here mighty Dudly once wou'd rove  "To plan his triumphs in the grove  "There looser Waller ever gay  "With Sacchariss in dalliance lay  "And Philip sidelong yonder spring  "His lavish carols wont to sing"  Hark I hear the echoes call  Hark the rushing waters fall  Lead me to the green retreats  Guide me to the Muses' seats  Where ancient bards retirement chose  Or ancient lovers wept their woes  What Genius points to yonder  An oak in  Penshurst  park planted the day Sir  Philip Sid∣ney  was born of which  Ben Johnson  speaks in the following manner  That taller tree which of a nut was set  At his great birth where all the Muses met  oak  What rapture does my soul provoke  There let me hang a garland high  There let my Muse her accents try  Be there my earliest homage paid  Be there my latest vigils made  For thou wast planted in the earth  The day that shone on Sidney's birth  That happy time that glorious day  The Muses came in concert gay  With harps in tune and ready song  The jolly Chorus tript along  In honour of th' auspicious morn  To hail an infant genius born  Next came the Faun in order meet  The Satyrs next with cloven feet  The Dryads swift that roam the woods  The Naiads green that swim the floods  Sylvanus left his silent cave  Medway came dropping from the wave  Vertumnus led his blushing spouse  And Ceres shook her wheaten brows  And Mars with milder look was there  And laughing Venus grac'd the rear  They join'd their hands in festive dance  And bade the smiling babe advance  Each gave a gift Sylvanus last  Ordain'd when all the pomp was past  Memorial meet a tree to grow  Which might to future ages shew  That on select occasion rare  A troop of Gods assembled there  The Naiads water'd well the ground  And Flora twin'd a woodbine round  The tree sprung fast in hallow'd earth  Coaeval with th' illustrious birth  Thus let my feet unwearied stray  Nor satisfied with one survey  When morn surveys with doubtful light  And Phebe pales her lamp of night  Still let me wander forth anew  And print my footsteps on the dew  What time the swain with ruddy cheek  Prepares to yoke his oxen meek  And early drest in neat array  The milkmaid chanting shrill her lay  Comes abroad with milking pail  And the sound of distant flail  Gives the ear a rough goodmorrow  And the lark from out his furrow  Soars upright on matin wings  And at the gate of heaven sings  But when the sun with fervid ray  Drives upwards to his noon of day  And couching oxen lay them down  Beneath the beechen umbrage brown  Then let me wander in the hall  Round whose antiquevisag'd wall  Hangs the armour Britons wore  Rudely cast in days of yore  Yon sword some heroe's arm might wield  Red in the ranks of  Chalgrave  's field  Where everglorious Hampden bled  And Freedom tears of sorrow shed  Or in the gallery let me walk  Where living pictures seem to talk  Where Beauty smiles serenely fair  And Courage frowns with martial air  Tho' whiskers quaint the face disguise  And habits odd to modern eyes  Behold what kings in Britain reign'd  Plantagenets with blood distain'd  And valiant Tudor's haughty race  And Stuarts England's worst disgrace  The Norman first with cruel frown  Proud of his newusurped crown  Begins the list and many more  Stern heroes form'd of roughest ore  See victor Henry there advance  Ev'n in his look he conquers France  And murd'rer Richard justly slain  By Richmond's steel on Bosworth plain  See the tyrant of his wives  Prodigal of fairest lives  And laureat Edward nurs'd in arts  Minerva school'd his kingly parts  But ah the melancholy Jane  A soul too tender for a queen  She sinks beneath imperial sway  The dearbought scepter of a day  And must she mount the scaffold drear  Hardhearted Mary learn to spare  Eliza next salutes the eye  Exalt the song to Liberty  The Muse repeats the sacred name  Eliza fills the voice of fame  From thence a baser age began  The royal ore polluted ran  Till foreign Nassau's valiant hand  Chac'd holy tyrants from the land  Downward from hence descend apace  To Brunswick's high illustrious race  And see the canvas speaks them brave  An injur'd nation born to save  Active in Freedom's righteous cause  And conscious of a just applause  But chiefly pleas'd the curious eye  With nice discernment loves to try  The labour'd wonders passing thought  Which warm Italian pencils wrought  Fables of love and stories old  By Greek or Latian poets told  How Jove committed many a rape  How young Acteon lost his shape  Or what celestial penmen writ  Or what the painter's genuine wit  From Fancy's storehouse could devise  Where Raphael claims the highest prize  Madonas  here decline the head  With fond maternal pleasure fed  Or lift their lucid eyes above  Where more is seen than holy love  There temples stand display'd within  And pillars in long order seen  And roofs rush forward to the sight  And lamps affect a living light  Or landscapes tire the trav'ling eye  The clouds in azure volumes fly  The distant trees distinguish'd rise  And hills look little in the skies  When day declines and ev'ning cool  Begins her gentle silent rule  Again as Fancy points the way  Benignant leader let me stray  And wilt thou Genius bring along  So shall my Muse exalt her song  The Lord who rules this ample scene  His Consort too with gracious mien  Her little offspring prattling round  While Echo lisps their infant sound  And let Goodnature born to please  Wait on our steps and graceful Ease  Nor Mirth be wanting as we walk  Nor Wit to season sober talk  Let gay Description too attend  And Fable told with moral end  And Satire quick that comes by stealth  And flowing Laughter friend to Health  Meanwhile Attention loves to mark  The deer that crop the shaven park  The steepbrow'd hill or forest wild  The sloping lawns and zephyrs mild  The clouds that blush with ev'ning red  Or meads with silver fountains fed  The fragrance of the newmown hay  And blackbird chanting on the spray  The calm farewel of parting light  And Ev'ning sad'ning into Night  Nor wearied yet my roving feet  Tho' Night comes on amain retreat  But still abroad I walk unseen  Along the starenlighten'd green  Superior joys my soul invite  Lift lift to heav'n the dazzled sight  Lo where the moon enthron'd on high  Sits steady empress of the sky  Enticing nations to revere  And proudly vain of pagan fear  Or where thro' clouds she travels fast  And seems on journey bent in haste  While thousand handmaid stars await  Attendant on their queen of state  'Tis now that in her high controul  Ambitious of a foreign rule  She stirs the Ocean to rebel  And factious waters fond to swell  Guides to battle in her carr  'Gainst her sister Earth to war  Thus let me muse on things sublime  Above the flight of modern rhyme  And call the soul of Newton down  Where it sits high on starry throne  Inventing laws for worlds to come  Or teaching comets how to roam  With him I'd learn of every star  But sourey'd Pedantry be far  And Ignorance in garb of Sense  With terms of art to make pretence  Hail happy soil illustrious earth  Which gav'st so many heroes birth  Which never wand'ring poet trod  But felt within th' inspiring God  In these transporting solemn shades  First I salute th' Aonian maids  Ah lead me Genius to thy haunts  Where Philomel at ev'ning chants  And as my oaten pipe resounds  Give musick to the forming sounds  A simple shepherd yet unknown  Aspires to snatch an ivy crown  On daring pinions bold to soar  Tho' here thy Waller sung before  And Johnson dipt his learned pen  And Sidney pour'd his fancyflowing strain  TO THE Hon WILMOTVAUGHAN  Esq  in WALES  By the Same  YE distant realms that hold my friend  Beneath a cold ungenial sky  Where lab'ring groves with weight of vapours bend  Or raving winds o'er barren mountains fly  Restore him quick to London's social clime  Restore him quick to friendship love and joy  Be swift ye lazy steeds of Time  Ye moments all your speed employ  Behold November's glooms arise  Pale suns with fainter glory shine  Dark gathering tempests blacken in the skies  And shiv'ring woods their sickly leaves resign  Is this a time on Cambrian hills to roam  To court disease in Winter's baleful reign  To listen to th' Atlantic foam  While rocks repel the roaring main  While horror fills the region vast  Rheumatic tortures Eurus brings  Pregnant with agues flies the northern blast  And clouds drop quartans from their flagging wings  Dost thou explore Sabrina's sountful source  Where huge Plinlimmon's hoary height ascends  Then downward mark her vagrant course  Till mix'd with clouds the landscape ends  Dost thou revere the hallow'd soil  Where Druids old sepulchred lie  Or up cold Snowden's craggy summits toil  And muse on ancient savage liberty  Ill suit such walks with bleak autumnal air  Say can November yield the joys of May  When Jove deforms the blasted year  Can Wallia boast a chearful day  The town expects theeHark around  Thro' every street of gay resort  New chariots rattle with awak'ning sound  And crowd the levees and besiege the court  The patriot kindling as his wars ensue  Now fires his soul with liberty and fame  Marshals his threat'ning tropes anew  And gives his hoarded thunders aim  Now seats their absent lords deplore  Neglected villas empty stand  Capacious Gro'venor gathers all its store  And mighty London swallows up the land  See sportive Vanity her flights begin  See newblown Folly's plenteous harvest rise  She mimick beauties dye their skin  And harlots roll their venal eyes  Fashions are set and fops return  And young coquettes in arms appear  Dreaming of conquest how their bosoms burn  Trick'd in the new fantastry of the year  Fly then away nor scorn to bear a part  In this gay scene of folly amply spread  Follies well us'd refine the heart  And pleasures clear the studious head  By grateful interchange of mirth  The toils of study sweeter grow  As varying seasons recommend the earth  Nor does Apollo always bend his bow  AN EPISTLE ADDRESS'D TO Sir THOMAS HANMER On his EDITION of SHAKESPEAR'S WORKS  By Mr WILLIAM COLLINS  SIR  WHILE born to bring the Muse's happier days  A patriot's hand protects a poet's lays  While nurs'd by you she sees her myrtles bloom  Green and unwither'd o'er his honour'd tomb  Excuse her doubts if yet she fears to tell  What secret transports in her bosom swell  With conscious awe she hears the critic's fame  And blushing hides her wreath at Shakespear's name  Hard was the lot those injur'd strains endur'd  Unown'd by Science and by years obscur'd  Fair Fancy wept and echoing sighs confess'd

 Where the gay moments which I once have known  O where that heart I fondly thought my own  From place to place I solitary roam  Abroad uneasy nor content at home  I scorn the beauties common eyes adore  The more I view them feel thy worth the more  Unmov'd I hear them speak or see them fair  And only think on theewho art not there  In vain would books their formal succour lend  Nor wit nor wisdom can relieve their friend  Wit can't deceive the pain I now endure  And wisdom shews the ill without the cure  When from thy sight I waste the tedious day  A thousand schemes I form and things to say  But when thy presence gives the time I seek  My heart's so full I wish but cannot speak  And cou'd I speak with eloquence and ease  Till now not studious of the art to please  Cou'd I at woman who so oft exclaim  Expose nor blush thy triumph and my shame  Abjure those maxims I so lately priz'd  And court that sex I foolishly despis'd  Own thou hast soften'd my obdurate mind  And thou reveng'd the wrongs of womankind  Lost were my words and fruitless all my pain  In vain to tell thee all I write in vain  My humble sighs shall only reach thy ears  And all my eloquence shall be my tears  And now for more I never must pretend  Hear me not as thy lover but thy friend  Thousands will fain thy little heart ensnare  For without danger none like thee are fair  But wisely chuse who best deserves thy flame  So shall the choice itself become thy fame  Nor yet despise tho' void of winning art  The plain and honest courtship of the heart  The skilful tongue in love's persuasive lore  Tho' less it feels will please and flatter more  And meanly learned in that guilty trade  Can long abuse a fond unthinking maid  And since their lips so knowing to deceive  Thy unexperienc'd youth might soon believe  And since their tears in false submission drest  Might thaw the icy coldness of thy breast  O shut thine eyes to such deceitful woe  Caught by the beauty of thy outward show  Like me they do not love whate'er they seem  Like mewith passion founded on esteem  Answer to the foregoing Lines  By the late Lord HERVEY  TOO well these lines that fatal truth declare  Which long I've known yet now I blush to hear  But say what hopes thy fond illfated love  What can it hope tho' mutual it shou'd prove  This little form is fair in vain for you  In vain for me thy honest heart is true  For wou'd'st thou fix dishonour on my name  And give me up to penitence and shame  Or gild my ruin with the name of wife  And make me a poor virtuous wretch for life  Cou'd'st thou submit to wear the marriage chain  Too sure a cure for all thy present pain  No saffron robe for us the godhead wears  His torch inverted and his face in tears  Tho' ev'ry softer wish were amply crown'd  Love soon wou'd cease to smile where Fortune frown'd  Then wou'd thy soul my fond consent deplore  And blame what it sollicited before  Thy own exhausted would reproach my truth  And say I had undone thy blinded youth  That I had damp'd Ambition's nobler flame  Eclips'd thy talents and obscur'd thy fame  To madrigals and odes that wit confin'd  That wou'd in senates or in courts have shin'd  Gloriously active in thy country's cause  Asserting freedom and enacting laws  Or say at best that negatively kind  You only mourn'd and silently repin'd  The jealous daemons in my own fond breast  Wou'd all these thoughts incessantly suggest  And all that sense must feel tho' pity had supprest  Yet added grief my apprehension fills  If there can be addition to those ills  When they shall cry whose harsh reproof I dread  "'Twas thy own deed thy folly on thy head"  Age knows not to allow for thoughtless youth  Nor pities tenderness nor honours truth  Holds it romantic to confess a heart  And say those virgins act a wiser a wiser part  Who hospitals and bedlams wou'd explore  To find the rich and only dread the poor  Who legal prostitutes for int'rest sake  Clodios and Timons to their bosoms take  And if avenging heav'n permit increase  People the world with folly and disease  Those titles deeds and rentrolls only wed  Whilst the best bidder mounts the venal bed  And the grave aunt and formal sire approve  This nuptial sale this auction of their love  But if regard to worth or sense be shown  That poor degenerate child her friends disown  Who dares to deviate by a virtuous choice  From her great name's hereditary vice  These scenes my prudence ushers to my mind  Of all the storms and quicksands I must find  If I embark upon this summer sea  Where Flatt'ry smooths and Pleasure gilds the way  Had our ill fate ne'er blown thy dang'rous flame  Beyond the limits of a friend's cold name  I might upon that score thy heart receive  And with that guiltless name my own deceive  That commerce now in vain you recommend  I dread the latent lover in the friend  Of ignorance I want the poor excuse  And know I both must take or both refuse  Hear then the safe the firm resolve I make  Ne'er to encourage one I must forsake  Whilst other maids a shameless path pursue  Neither to int'rest nor to honour true  And proud to swell the triumph of their eyes  Exult in love from lovers they despise  Their maxims all revers'd I mean to prove  And tho' I like the lover quit the love  EPISTLES in the Manner of OVID MONIMIA to PHILOCLES  By the Same  SINCE language never can describe my pain  How can I hope to move when I complain  But such is woman's frenzy in distress  We love to plead tho' hopeless of redress  Perhaps affecting ignorance 'thou'lt say  From whence these lines whose message to convey  Mock not my grief with that feign'd cold demand  Too well you know the hapless writer's hand  But if you force me to avow my shame  Behold it prefac'd with Monimia's name  Lost to the world abandon'd and forlorn  Expos'd to infamy reproach and scorn  To mirth and comfort lost and all for you  Yet lost perhaps to your remembrance too  How hard my lot what refuge can I try  Weary of life and yet afraid to die  Of hope the wretch's last resort bereft  By friends by kindred by my lover left  Oh frail dependence of confiding fools  On lovers oaths or friendship's sacred rules  How weak in modern heats too late I find  Monimia's faln and Philocles unkind  To these reflections each slow wearing day  And each revolving night a constant prey  Think what I suffer nor ungentle hear  What madness dictates in my fond despair  Grudge not this short relief too fast it flies  Nor chide that weakness I myself despise  One moment sure may be at least her due  Who sacrific'd her all of life for you  Without a frown this farewel then receive  For 'tis the last my hapless love shall give  Nor this I wou'd if reason cou'd command  But what restriction reins a lover's hand  Nor prudence shame nor pride nor int'rest sways  The hand implicitly the heart obeys  Too well this maxim has my conduct shewn  Too well that conduct to the world is known  Oft have I writ and often to the flame  Condemn'd this afterwitness of my shame  Oft in my cooler recollected thought  Thy beauties and my fondness half forgot  How short those intervals for reason's aid  Thus to myself in anguish have I said  Thy vain remonstrance foolish maid give o'er  Who act the wrong can ne'er that wrong deplore  Then sanguine hopes again delusive reign  I form'd thee melting as I tell my pain  If not of rock thy flinty heart is made  Nor tygers nurs'd thee in the desart shade  Let me at least thy cold compassion prove  That slender sustenance of greedy love  Tho' no return my warmer wishes find  Be to the wretch tho' not the mistress kind  Nor whilst I court my melancholy state  Forget 'twas love and thee that wrought my fate  Without restraint habituate to range  The paths of pleasure can I bear this change  Doom'd from the world unwilling to retire  In bloom of life and warm with young desire  In lieu of roofs with regal splendor gay  Condemn'd in distant wilds to drag the day  Where beasts of prey maintain their savage court  Or human brutes the worst of brutes resort  Yes yes the change I cou'd unsighing see  For none I mourn but what I find in thee  There center all my woes thy heart estrang'd  I weep my lover not my fortune chang'd  Bless'd with thy presence I could all forget  Nor gilded palaces in huts regret  But exil'd thence superfluous is the rest  Each place the same my hell is in my breast  To pleasure dead and living but to pain  My only sense to suffer and complain  As all my wrongs distressful I repeat  Say can thy pulse with equal cadence beat  Can'st thou know peace is conscience mute within  That upright delegate for secret sin  Is nature so extinguish'd in thy heart  That not one spark remains to take my part  Not one repentant throb one grateful sigh  Thy breast unruffled and unwet thy eye  Thou cool betrayer temperate in ill  Thou nor remorse nor thought humane can'st feel  Nature has form'd thee of the rougher kind  And education more debas'd thy mind  Born in an age when guilt and fraud prevail  When Justice sleeps and Int'rest holds the scale  Thy loose companions a licentious crew  Most to each other all to us untrue  Whom chance or habit mix but rarely choice  Nor leagu'd in friendship but in social vice  Who indigent of honour or of shame  Glory in crimes which others blush to name  By right or wrong disdaining to be mov'd  Unprincipled unloving and unlov'd  The fair who trusts their prostituted vows  If not their falshood still their boasts expose  Nor knows the wisest to elude the harm  Ev'n she whose prudence shuns the tinsel charm  They know to slander though they fail to warm  They make her languish in fictitious flame  Affix some specious slander on her name  And baffled by her virtue triumph o'er her fame  These are the leaders of thy blinded youth  These vile seducers laugh'd thee out of truth  Whose scurril jests all solemn ties profane  Or Friendship's band or Hymen's sacred chain  Morality as weakness they upbraid  Nor e'en revere Religion's hallow'd head  Alike they spurn divine and human laws  And treat the honest like the christian cause  Curse on that tongue whose vile pernicious art  Delights the ear but to corrupt the heart  That takes advantage of the chearful hour  When weaken'd Virtue bends to Nature's pow'r  And would the goodness of the soul efface  To substitute dishonour in her place  With such you lose the day in false delights  In lewd debauch you revel out the nights  O fatal commerce to Monimia's peace  Their arguments convince because they please  Whilst sophistry for reason they admit  And wander dazzled by the glare of wit  Wit that on ill a specious lustre throws  And in false colours ev'ry object shows  That gilds the wrong depreciating the right  And hurts the judgment while it feasts the sight  So in the prism to the deluded eye  Each pictur'd trifle takes a rainbow dye  With borrow'd charms the shining prospect glows  And truth revers'd the faithless mirror shows  Inverted scenes in bright confusion lie  The lawns impending o'er the nether sky  No just no real images we meet  But all the gaudy vision is deceit  Oft I revolve in this distracted mind  Each word each look that spoke my charmer kind  But oh how dear their memory I pay  What pleasures past can present cares allay  Of all I love for ever dispossess'd  Ah what avails to think I once was bless'd  Hard disposition of unequal fate  Mix'd are our joys and transient are their date  Nor can reflection bring them back again  Yet brings an aftersting to ev'ry pain  Thy fatal letters oh immoral youth  Those perjur'd pledges of fictitious truth  Dear as they were no second joy afford  My cred'lous heart once leap'd at ev'ry word  My glowing bosom throbb'd with thickheav'd sighs  And floods of rapture gush'd into my eyes  When now repeated for thy theft was vain  Each treasur'd syllable my thoughts retain  Far other passions rule and diff'rent care  My joys and grief my transports and despair  Why dost thou mock the ties of constant love  But half its joys the faithless ever prove  They only taste the pleasures they receive  When sure the noblest is in those we give  Acceptance is the heav'n which mortals know  But 'tis the bliss of angels to bestow  Oh emulate my love that task divine  Be thou that angel and that heav'n be mine  Yes yet relent yet intercept my fate  Alas I rave and sue for new deceit  As soon the dead shall from the grave return  As love extinguish'd with new ardor burn  Oh that I dar'd to act a Roman part  And stab thy image in this faithful heart  Where riveted for life secure you reign  A cruel inmate author of my pain  But cowardlike irresolute I wait  Time's tardy aid nor dare to rush on fate  Perhaps may linger on life's latest stage  Survey thy cruelties and fall by age  Nogrief shall swell my sails and speed me o'er  Despair my pilot to that quiet shore  Where I can trust and thou betray no more  Might I but once again behold thy charms  Might I but breathe my last in those dear arms  On that lov'd face but fix my closing eye  Permitted where I might not live to die  My soften'd fate I wou'd accuse no more  But fate has no such happiness in store  'Tis past 'tis donewhat gleam of hope behind  When I can ne'er be false nor thou be kind  Why then this care'tis weak'tis vainfarewel  At that last word what agonies I feel  I faintI dieremember I was true  'Tis all I asketernallyadieu  FLORA to POMPEY  By the Same  Pompey  when he was very young fell in love with  Flora  a  Roman  courtezan who was so very beautiful that the  Ro∣mans  had her painted to adorn the temple of  Castor  and  Pollux Geminius Pompey  's friend afterwards fell in love with her too but she prepossessed with a passion for  Pompey  would not listen to  Geminius Pompey  in compassion to his friend yielded him his mistress which  Flora  took so much to heart that she fell dangerously ill upon it and in that sickness is supposed to write the following letter to  Pompey  ERE death these closing eyes for ever shade  That death thy cruelties have welcome made  Receive thou yet lov'd man this one adieu  This last farewel to happiness and you  My eyes o'erflow with tears my trembling hand  Can scarce the letters form or pen command  The dancing paper swims before my sight  And scarce myself can read the words I write  Think you behold me in this lost estate  And think yourself the author of my fate  How vast the change your Flora's now become  The gen'ral pity not the boast of Rome  This form a pattern to the sculptor's art  This face the idol once of Pompey's heart  Whose pictur'd beauties Rome thought fit to place  The sacred temples of her gods to grace  Are charming now no more the bloom is fled  The lillies languid and the roses dead  Soon shall some hand the glorious work deface  Where Grecian pencils tell what Flora was  No longer my resemblance they impart  They lost their likeness when I lost thy heart  Oh that those hours could take their turn again  When Pompey lab'ring with a jealous pain  His Flora thus bespoke "Say my dear love  "Shall all these rivals unsuccessful prove  "In vain for ever shall the Roman youth  "Envy my happiness and tempt thy truth  "Shall neither tears nor pray'rs thy pity move  "Ah give not pity 'tis akin to love  "Would Flora were not fair in such excess  "That I might fear tho' not adore her less"  Fool that I was I sought to ease that grief  Nor knew indiff'rence follow'd the relief  Experience taught the cruel truth too late  I never dreaded till I found my fate  'Twas mine to ask if Pompey's self could hear  Unmov'd his rival's unsuccessful pray'r  To make thee swear he'd not thy pity move  Alas such pity is no kin to love  'Twas thou thyself ungrateful as thou art  Bade me unbend the rigour of my heart  You chid my faith reproach'd my being true  Unnat'ral thought and labour'd to subdue  The constancy my soul maintain'd for you  To other arms your mistress you condemn'd  Too cool a lover and too warm a friend  How could'st thou thus my lavish heart abuse  To ask the only thing it could refuse  Nor yet upbraid me Pompey what I say  For 'tis my merit that I can't obey  Yet this alledg'd against me as a fault  Thy rage fomented and my ruin wrought  Just gods what tye what conduct can prevail  O'er fickle man when truth like mine can fail  Urge not to gloss thy crime the name of friend  We know how far those sacred laws extend  Since other heroes have not blush'd to prove  How weak all passions when oppos'd to love  Nor boast the virtuous conflict of thy heart  When gen'rous pity took Geminius' part  'Tis all heroic fraud and Roman art  Such flights of honour might amuse the crowd  But by a mistress ne'er can be allow'd  Keep for the senate and the grave debate  That infamous hypocrisy of state  There words are virtue and your trade deceit  No riddle is thy change nor hard t' explain  Flora was fond and Pompey was a man  No longer then a specious tale pretend  Nor plead fictitious merit to your friend  By nature false you follow'd her decree  Nor gen'rous are to him but false to me  You say you melted at Geminius' tears  You say you felt his agonizing cares  Gross artifice that this from him could move  And not from Flora whom you say you love  You could not bear to hear your rival sigh  Yet bear unmov'd to see your mistress die  Inhuman hypocrite nor thus can he  My wrongs and my distress obdurate see  He who receiv'd condemns the gift you made  And joins with me the giver to upbraid  Forgetting he's oblig'd and mourning I'm betray'd  He loves too well that cruel gift to use  Which Pompey lov'd too little to refuse  Fain would he call my vagrant lord again  But I the kind ambassador restrain  I scorn to let another take my part  And to myself will owe or lose thy heart  Can nothing e'er rekindle love in thee  Can nothing e'er extinguish it in me  That I could tear thee from this injur'd breast  And where you gave my person give the rest  At once to grant and punish thy request  That I could place thy worthy rival there  No second insult need my fondness fear  He views not Flora with her Pompey's eyes  He loves like me he doats despairs and dies  Come to my arms thou dear deserving youth  Thou prodigy of man thou man with truth  For him I will redouble every care  To please for him these faded charms repair  To crown his vows and sharpen thy despair  Oh 'tis illusion all and idle rage  No second passion can this heart engage  And shortly Pompey shall thy Flora prove  Death may dissolve but nothing change her love  ARISBE to MARIUS Junior  From FONTENELLE By the Same  When  Marius  was expelled from  Rome  by  Sylla  's faction and retired into  Africa  his son who accompany'd him fell into the hands of  Hiempsal  king of  Numidia  who kept him prisoner One of the mistresses of that king fell in love with  Marius  ju∣nior and was so generous to contrive and give him his liberty though by that means she sacrificed her love for ever 'Twas after he had rejoin'd his father that she writ him the follow∣ing letter  I  OF all I valued all I lov'd bereft  Say has my heart this little comfort left  That you the mem'ry of its truth retain  And think with grateful pity on my pain  II  Tho' but with life my sorrows can have end  For death alone can join me to my friend  Yet think not I repent I set you free  I mourn your absence not your liberty  III  Before my Marius left Numidia's coast  Each day I saw him scarce an hour was lost  Now months and years must pass nay life shall prove  But one long absence from the man I love  IV  Painful reflection poyson to my mind  Was it but mortal too it would be kind  But mad with grief I search the palace round  And in that madness dream you're to be found  V  Would'st thou believe it to those walls I fly  Where thou wert captive held there frantick cry  These fetters sure my vagrant's flight restrain'd  Alas these setters I myself unchain'd  VI  The livelong day I mourn I loath the light  And wait impatient each returning night  What tho' the horrid gloom augment my grief  'Tis grateful still for I disclaim relief  VII  That coz'ner hope intrudes not on my woe  One only interval my sorrows know  When dreams the kind reversers of my pain  Bring back my charming fugitive again  VIII  Yet there's a grief surpassing all the rest  A jealous daemon whispers in my breast  Marius was false for liberty alone  The show of love the hypocrite put on  IX  Then I reflect ah would I could forget  How much your thoughts on war and Rome were set  How little passion did that conduct prove  Too strong thy reason but too weak thy love  X  Thy sword 'tis true a father's cause demands  But 'twas a mistress gave it to thy hands  To love and duty just give each their part  His be the arm and mine be all thy heart  XI  But what avail these thoughts fond wretch give o'er  Marius or false or true is thine no more  Since Fate has cast the lot and we must part  Why should I wish to think I had his heart  XII  Yes let me cherish that remembrance still  That thought alone shall soften ev'ry ill  To tell my soul his love his truth was such  All was his due nor have I done too much  XIII  Deceitful comfort let me not persuade  My cred'lous heart its fondness was repaid  It makes my soul with double anguish mourn  Those joys which never never must return  XIV  Perhaps ev'n you what most I wish oppose  And in the Roman all the lover lose  I'm a Numidian and your soul disdains  To bear th' inglorious weight of foreign chains  XV  Can any climate then so barb'rous prove  To stand excluded from the laws of Love  His empire's universal unconfin'd  His proxy beauty and his slaves mankind  XVI  Nor am I a Numidian but by name  For I can int'rest for my love disclaim  My virtue shows what 'twas the gods design'd  By chance on Africk's clay they stamp'd a Roman mind  XVII  Not all the heroes which your Rome can boast  So much for fame as I for you have lost  Yourself I lost oh grateful then confess  My tryal greater tho' my glory less  XVIII  Yes partial gods inflicters of my care  Be witness what I felt what grief what fear  When full of stifled woes the night he fled  No sigh I dar'd to breathe no tear to shed  XIX  Whilst men of faith approv'd a chosen crew  Firm to their trust and to their mistress true  With care too punctual my commands obey  And in one freight my life and thee convey  XX  The harder task was mine condemn'd to bear  With brow serene my agonizing care  To mix in idle talk to force a smile  A king and jealous lover to beguile  XXI  Think in that dreadful interval of fate  All I held dear thy safety in debate  Think what I suffer'd whilst my heart afraid  Suggests a thousand times that's all betray'd  XXII  A thousand times revolving in my mind  The doubtful chance oh Love said I be kind  Propitious to my scheme thy vot'ry aid  And be my fondness by success repaid  XXIII  Now bolder grown with sanguine hopes elate  My fancy represents thy smiling fate  The guards deceiv'd and ev'ry danger o'er  The winds already waft him from the shore  XXIV  These pleasing images anew impart  Life to my eyes and gladness to my heart  Dispel the gloomy fears that cloud my face  And charm the little flutterer to peace  XXV  But now the king or tasteless to my charms  Or weary of an absent mistress' arms  His own apartment seeks and grateful rest  That courted stranger to the careful breast  XXVI  Whilst I by hopes and fears alternate sway'd  Impatient ask the slaves if I'm obey'd  'Tis done they cry'd and struck me with despair  For what I long'd to know I dy'd to hear  XXVII  Fantastick turn of a distracted mind  I blam'd the gods for having been too kind  Curs'd the success they granted to my vows  And this assistant hand that fill'd my woes  XXVIII  Such was my frenzy in that hour of care  And such th' injustice of my bold despair  That even those ungrateful I upbraid  Whose fatal diligence my will obey'd  XXIX  Scarce Marius did thyself escape my rage  Most lov'd of men when fears of black presage  Describe thy heart so fond of liberty  It never gave one parting throb for me  XXX  At every step you should have turn'd your eye  Dropt a regretful tear and heav'd a sigh  The nature of the grace I

LETTRES PERSANNES  By the Same  Roxana  one of  Usbeck  's wives was found whilst he was in  Europe  in bed with her lover whom she had privately let into the seraglio The guardian eunuch who discovered them had the man murdered on the spot and her close guarded till he received instructions from his master how to dispose of her During that interval she swallowed poyson and is supposed to write the following letter whilst she is dying  THINK not I write my innocence to prove  To sue for pity or awake thy love  No mean defence expect or abject pray'rs  Thou know'st no mercy and I know no tears  I laugh at all thy vengeance has decreed  Avow the fact and glory in the deed  Yes tyrant I deceiv'd thy spies and thee  Pleas'd in oppression and in bondage free  The rigid agents of thy cruel laws  By gold I won to aid my juster cause  With dextrous skill eluded all thy care  And acted more than jealousy could fear  To wanton bow'rs this prisonhouse I turn'd  And bless'd that absence which you thought I mourn'd  But short those joys allow'd by niggard Fate  Yet so refin'd so exquisitely great  That their excess compensated their date  I die already in each burning vein  I feel the poys'nous draught and bless the pain  For what is life unless its joys we prove  And where is joy depriv'd of what we love  Yet ere I die this justice I have paid  To my dear murder'd lover's injur'd shade  Those sacrilegious instruments of power  Who wrought that ruin these sad eyes deplore  Already with their blood their crimes attone  And for his life have sacrific'd their own  Thee tho' restraint and absence may defend  From my revenge my curses still attend  Despair like mine barbarian be thy part  Remorse afflict and sorrow sting thy heart  Nor think this hate commencing in my breast  Tho' prudence long its latent force suppress'd  I knew those wrongs that I was forc'd to bear  And curs'd those chains Injustice made me wear  For could'st thou hope Roxana to deceive  With idle tales which only fools believe  Poor abject souls in superstition bred  In ign'rance train'd by prejudice misled  Whom hireling dervises by proxy teach  From those whose false prerogative they preach  Didst thou imagine me so weak of mind  Because I murmur'd not I ne'er repin'd  But hugg'd my chain and thought my jaylor kind  That willingly those laws I e'er obey'd  Which Pride invented and Oppression made  And whilst selflicens'd through the world you rove  To quicken appetite by change in love  Each passion sated and each wish possess'd  That Lust can urge or Fancy can suggest  That I should mourn thy loss with fond regret  Weep the misfortune and the wrong forget  Could I believe that heav'n this beauty gave  Thy transient pleasure and thy lasting slave  Indu'd with reason only to fulfil  The harsh commands of thy capricious will  No Usbeck no my soul disdain'd those laws  And tho' I wanted pow'r t' assert my cause  My right I knew and still those pleasures sought  Which Justice warranted and Nature taught  On Custom's senseless precepts I refin'd  I weigh'd what heav'n I knew what man design'd  And form'd by her own rules my freeborn mind  Thus whilst this wretched body own'd thy pow'r  Doom'd unredress'd its hardships to deplore  My soul subservient to herself alone  And Reason independent on her throne  Contemn'd thy dictates and obey'd their own  Yet thus far to my conduct thanks are due  At least I condescended to seem true  Endeavour'd still my sentiments to hide  Indulg'd thy vanity and sooth'd thy pride  Tho' this submission to a tyrant paid  Whom not my duty but my fears obey'd  If rightly weigh'd would more deserve thy blame  Who call it Virtue but prophane her name  For to the world I should have own'd that love  Which all impartial judges must approve  You urg'd a right to tyrannize my heart  Which he solliciting assail'd by art  Whilst I impatient of the name of slave  To force refus'd what I to merit gave  Oft as thy slaves this wretched body led  To the detested pleasures of thy bed  In those soft moments consecrate to joy  Which extacy and transport should employ  Clasp'd in your arms you wonder'd still to find  So cold my kisses so compos'd my mind  But had thy cheated eyes discern'd aright  You'd found aversion where you sought delight  Not that my soul incapable of love  No charms could warm no tenderness could move  For him whose love my every thought possess'd  A fiercer passion fill'd this constant breast  Than truth e'er felt or falshood e'er possess'd  This stile unusual to thy pride appears  For truth's a stranger to the tyrant's ears  But what have I to manage or to dread  Nor threats alarm nor insults hurt the dead  No wrongs they feel no miseries they find  Cares are the legacies we leave behind  In the calm grave no Usbecks we deplore  No tyrant husband no oppressive pow'r  Alas I faintDeath intercepts the rest  The venom'd drug is busy in my breast  Each nerve's unstrung a mist obscures the day  My senses strength and ev'n my hate decay  Tho' rage awhile the ebbing spirits stay'd  'Tis pastthey sink beneath the transient aid  Take then inhuman wretch my last farewel  Pain be thy portion here hereafter hell  And when our prophet shall my fate decree  Be any curse my punishment but thee  EPILOGUE design'd for SOPHONISBA And to have been spoken by Mrs OLDFIELD  By the Same  BEFORE you sign poor Sophonisba's doom  In her behalf petitioner I come  Not but our author knows whate'er I say  That I could find objections to his play  This double marriage for her country's good  I told him never would be understood  And that ye all would say 'twas flesh and blood  Had Carthage only been in madam's head  Her champion never had been in her bed  For could the ideot think a husband's name  Would make him quit his interest friends and fame  That he would risque a kingdom for a wife  And act dependent in a place for life  Yet when stern Cato shall condemn the fair  Whilst publick good she thunder'd in your ear  If private interest had a  little  share  You know she acted not against the laws  Of those oldfashion'd times that in her cause  Old Syphax could no longer make a stand  And Massinissa woo'd her sword in hand  But did not take the way to whet that sword  Heroes fight coldly when wives give the word  She should have kept him keen employ'd her charms  Not as a bribe but to reward his arms  Have told him when Rome yielded she would yield  And sent him fresh not yawning to the field  She talk'd it well to rouse him to the fight  But like Penelope when out of sight  All she had done by day undid by night  Is this your wily Carthaginian kind  No English woman had been half so kind  What from a husband's hand could she expect  But ratsbane or that common fate neglect  Perhaps some languishing soft fair may say  Poyson's so shockingbut consider pray  She fear'd the Roman he the marriage chain  All other means to free them both were vain  Let none then Massinissa's conduct blame  He first his love consulted then his fame  And if the fair one with too little art  Whilst seemingly she play'd a patriotpart  Was secretly the dupe of her own heart  Forgive a fault she strove so well to hide  Nor be compassion to her fate deny'd  Who liv'd unhappily and greatly dy'd  An Imitation of the Eleventh Ode of the First Book of HORACE  By the Same  FORBEAR my dear Stephen with a fruitless desire  Into truths which are better conceal'd to enquire  Perhaps many years are allow'd us by Fate  Or next winter perhaps is the last of their date  Let the credulous fools whom astrologers cheat  Exult or despond as they vary deceit  Who anticipate care their own pleasure destroy  And invite disappointment who build upon joy  All ills unforeseen we the easiest endure  What avails to foresee unless foresight could cure  And from ills by their art how can wretches be freed  When that art must be false or those ills be decreed  From reflection and hope little comfort we find  To possession alone let thy thoughts be confin'd  Today's all the treasure poor mortals can boast  For tomorrow's not gained and yesterday's lost  Even now whilst I write time steals on our youth  And a moment's cut off from my friendship and truth  Then seize the swift blessing enjoy the dear now  And take not expect what hereafter 'll bestow  A LOVE LETTER  By the Same  WHAT shall I say to fix thy wav'ring mind  To chase thy doubts and force thee to be kind  What weight of argument can turn the scale  If intercession from a lover fail  By what shall I conjure thee to obey  This tender summons nor prolong thy stay  If unabated in this constant breast  That passion burns which once thy vows profess'd  If absence has not chill'd the languid flame  Its ardour and its purity the same  Indulge those transports and no more controul  The dictates of thy fond consenting soul  By no vain scruple be thy purpose sway'd  And only Love implicitly obey'd  Let inclination this debate decide  Nor be thy prudence but thy heart thy guide  But real prudence never can oppose  What Love suggests and Gratitude avows  The warm dear raptures which thy bosom move  'Tis virtue to indulge 'tis wisdom to improve  For think how few the joys allow'd by Fate  How mix'd the cup how short their longest date  How onward still the stream of pleasure flows  That no reflux the rapid current knows  Not ev'n thy charms can bribe the ruthless hand  Of rigid Time to stay his ebbing sand  Fair as thou art that beauty must decay  The night of age succeeds the brightest day  That check where Nature's sweetest garden blows  Her whitest lily and her warmest rose  Those eyes those meaning ministers of Love  Who what thy lips can only utter prove  These must resign their lustre those their bloom  And find with meaner charms one common doom  Pass but a few short years this change must be  Nor one less dreadful shalt thou mourn in me  For tho' no chance can alienate my flame  While thine to feed the lamp shall burn the same  Yet shall the stream of years abate that fire  And cold esteem succeed to warm desire  Then on thy breast unraptur'd shall I dwell  Nor feel a joy beyond what I can tell  Or say should sickness antedate that woe  And intercept what Time would else allow  If pain should pall my taste to all thy charms  Or Death himself should tear me from thy arms  How would'st thou then regret with fruitless truth  The precious squander'd hours of health and youth  Come then my love nor trust the future day  Live whilst we can be happy whilst we may  For what is life unless its joys we prove  And what is happiness but mutual love  Our time is wealth no frugal hand can store  All our possession is the present hour  And he who spares to use it ever poor  The golden  now  is all that we can boast  And that like snow at once is grasp'd and lost  Haste wing thy passage then no more delay  But to these eyes their sole delight convey  Not thus I languish'd for thy virgin charms  When first surrender'd to these eager arms  When first admitted to that heav'n thy breast  To mine I strain'd that charming foe to rest  How leaps my conscious heart whilst I retrace  The dear idea of that strict embrace  When on thy bosom quite entranc'd I lay  And love unsated the short night away  Whilst half reluctant you and half resign'd  Amidst fears wishes pain and pleasure join'd  Now holding off now growing to my breast  By turns reprov'd me and by turns caress'd  Oh how remembrance throbs in every vein  I pant I sicken for that scene again  My senses ach I can no word command  And the pen totters in my trembling hand  Farewel thou only joy on earth I know  And all that man can taste of heav'n below  This little poem was among several others on the same occa∣sion printed by Dr  Rogers  with his inaugural exercise at  Pa∣dua  and afterwards in the same manner republished by him at  London  together with his  Harveian  oration before the college of physicians in the year    while Mr  Waller  was yet living  VERSES to Dr GEORGE ROGERS on his taking the Degree of Doctor in Physic at Padua in the Year  By Mr WALLER  WHEN as of old the earth's bold children strove  With hills on hills to scale the throne of Jove  Pallas and Mars stood by their sovereign's side  And their bright arms in his defence employ'd  While the wife Phoebus Hermes and the rest  Who joy in peace and love the Muses best  Descending from their so distemper'd seat  Our groves and meadows chose for their retreat  There first Apollo tried the various use  Of herbs and learn'd the virtue of their juice  And fram'd that art to which who can pretend  A juster title than our noble friend  Whom the like tempest drives from his abode  And like employment entertains abroad  This crowns him here and in the bays so earn'd  His country's honour is no less concern'd  Since it appears not all the English rave  To ruin bent some study how to save  And as Hippocrates did once extend  His sacred art whole cities to amend  So we brave friend suppose that thy great skill  Thy gentle mind and fair example will  At thy return reclaim our frantic isle  Their spirits calm and peace again shall smile  EDM WALLER Anglus  Patavii typis Pauli Frambotti  VIRGIL's Tomb NAPLES  Tenues ignavo Pollio chordas  Pulso Maroneique redens in margine templi  Suae animum magni tumulis adcanto magistri  Stat  I Came great bard to gaze upon thy shrine  And o'er thy relicks wait th' inspiring Nine  For sure I said where Maro's ashes sleep  The weeping Muses must their vigils keep  Still o'er their fav'rite's monument they mourn  And with poetic trophies grace his urn  Have placed the shield and martial trumpet here  The shepherd's pipe and rural honours there  Fancy had deck'd the consecrated ground  And scatter'd neverfading roses round  And now my bold romantic thought aspires  To hear the echo of celestial lyres  Then catch some sound to bear delighted home  And boast I learnt the verse at Virgil's tomb  Or stretch'd beneath thy myrtle's fragrant shade  With dreams extatic hov'ring o'er my head  See forms august and laurel'd ghosts ascend  And with thyself perhaps the long procession end  I camebut soon the phantoms disappear'd  Far other scenes than wanton Hope had rear'd  No faery rites no funeral pomp I found  No trophied walls with wreaths of laurel round  A mean unhonour'd ruin faintly show'd  The spot where once thy mausoleum stood  Hardly the form remain'd a nodding dome  O'ergrown with moss is now all Virgil's tomb  'Twas such a scene as gave a kind relief  To memory in sweetlypensive grief  Gloomy unpleasing images it wrought  No musing soft complacency of thought  For Time had canker'd all and worn away  Ev'n the last mournful graces of decay  Oblivion hateful goddess sate before  And cover'd with her dusky wings the door  No silver harps I heard no Muse's voice  But birds obscene in horrid notes rejoice  Fancy recoil'd and with his tinsel train  Forsook the chearless scene no more remain  The warm ambitious hopes of airy youth  Severe Reflection came and frowning Truth  Away each glitt'ring gay idea fled  And bade a melancholy train succeed  That form'd or seem'd to form a mournful call  In feeble echoes mutt'ring round the wall  Seek not the Muses here th' affrighted maids  Have fled Parthenope's polluted shades  Her happy shores the seats of joy and ease  Their fav'rite mansions once no longer please  No longer as of old in transport lost  The sisters rove along th' enchanted coast  They turn with horror from each muchlov'd stream  And loath the fields that were their darling theme  The tuneful names themselves once fondly gave  To ev'ry swelling hill and mossy cave  So pleasing then are only heard with sighs  And each sad echo bids their sorrow rise  Yet Nature smiles as when their Virgil sung  Nor 'midst a fairer scene his lyre was strung  Still bloom the sweets of his elysium here  And the same charms in ev'ry grove appear  But ah in vain indulgent suns prevail  Health and delight in ev'ry balmy gale  Are wafted now in vain small comfort bring  To weeping eyes the beauties of the spring  To groaning slaves those fragrant meads belong  Where Tully dictated and Maro sung  Long since alas those golden days are flown  Where here each Science wore its proper crown  Pale Tyranny had laid their altars low  And rent the laurel from the Muse's brow  What wonder then 'midst such a scene to see  The Arts expire with bleeding Liberty  Pensive and sad each fair angelic form  roops like the wearied dove

And ye neat country lasses in clean linen gown  As neat and as blithe and as pretty as they  Come away strait to Ovington for you can't think  What a charming new walk there is made on the Link  Look how lovely the prospect the meadows how green  The fields and the woods in the vale or the hill  The trees and the cotage that peeps out between  The clear stream that runs bubbling in many a rill  That will show your fair face as you stand on the brink  And murmurs most sweetly all under the Link  How pleasant the morning how clear the blue sky  How pure the fresh air and how healthy the place  Your heart goes a pitapat light as a fly  And the blood circles briskly and glows in your face  Wou'd you paint your fair cheeks with the rose and the pink  Throw your washes away take a walk on the Link  After dinner the 'squire ere the ladies retreat  Marches off with some friends that will ply the brisk glass  Gives us liquor enough and a good pleasant seat  And damns your fine taste and your finical lass  Al fresco my lads we'll carouse and we'll drink  Take your bottle each man and away to the Link  Not so gentle Collin whom love holds in thrall  To Molly he steals all in silence away  And when nought can be heard but the rude waterfall  And the woodbine breathes sweetest at close of the day  He takes her soft hand and he tips her the wink  Come my dear let us take a cool walk on the Link  But O ye fair maidens be sure have a care  Nor lay yourselves open to love's cruel dart  Of the hour and the place and the season beware  And guard well each passage that leads to your heart  Sly Cupid will steal in at some little chink  If you walk in the evening too late on the Link  Ye poets so lofty who love to retire  From the noise of the town to the stream and the wood  Who in

come you who for thought are at little expence  Who indite gentle pastoral ballad or song  You see with smooth numbers and not too much sense  How the verses run easy and glibly along  And the rhime at the close how it falls with a clink  So kind are the Muses that sport on the Link  THE SQUIRE of DAMES  A POEM In SPENSER's STILE  ADVERTISEMENT  In the seventh Canto of the Legend of  Chastity  in  Spenser  's  Fairy Queen  the Squire of  Dames  tells  Satyrane  that by order of his mistress  Columbel  after having served the ladies for a year he was sent out a second time not to return till he could find three hundred women incapable of yielding to any temptation The bad success he met with in the course of the three years which is slightly touch'd upon by  Spenser  is the foundation of the following poem  PROLOGUE  I  HARD is the heart that never knew to love  Ne felt the pleasing anguish of desire  Ye British maids more fair than Venus' dove  For you alone I tune my humble lyre  Adopt me nymphs receive me in your quire  Make me your bard for that is all my care  Then shall I envy not that aged sire  Who doth for court his annual song prepare  I lever myrtle wreath than Kesar's laurel wear  II  Think not because I write of Columbel  I thence would blast the sex with impious tale  Transactions vile of foreign stronds I tell  Ne 'gainst a British female would I rail  For all the wealth that rolls on Indian grail  Here beauty truth and chastity are found  Eleonora here with visage pale  Did suck the poison from her Edward's wound  And Anna's nuptial faith shall stond for aye renown'd  III  See the fair swans on Thamis' lovely tide  The which do trim their pennons silver bright  In shining ranks they down the waters ride  Oft have mine eyes devour'd the gallant sight  Then cast thy looks with wonder and delight  Where yon sweet nymphs enjoy the ev'ning air  Some daunce along the green like fairies light  Some flow'rets cull to deck their flowing hair  Then tell me soothly swain which sight thou deem'st most fair  IV  To you bright stars that sparkle on our isle  I give my life my fortune and my fame  For my whole guerdon grant me but a smile  A smile from you is all I hope or claim  Nor age's ice my ardent zeal shall tame  To my life's end I shall your names adore  Not hermit's bosoms feel so pure a flame  Warm'd by approval I more high shall soar  Receive my humble lays my heart was yours before  V  Should you consent I'll quit my shepherd's grey  And don more graceful and more costly gear  My crook and scrip I'll throw with scorn away  And in a samite garment streit appear  Farewell ye groves which once I held so dear  Farewell ye glens I other joys pursue  Then shall the world your matchless pow'r revere  And own what wonders your sweet smiles can do  That could a simple clown into a bard transmew  CANTO I  ARGUMENT  The Squire of Dames to  Satyrane  His history doth tell  With all the toils he underwent  To gain his  Columbel  I  THE Squire of Dames his tale thus 'gan to tell  Sith you command my tongue sir Satyrane  I now will all declare that me befell  The cause of muchel scath and dol'rous pain  Ne shall thy gentle eye from tears refrain  Me Columbel commanded far to go  'Till I should full three hundred nymphs attain  Whose hearts should aye with Virtue's lessons glow  And to all swains but one cry out for ever No  II  To find the fortilage that ne'er will yield  Is not an easy matter good sir Knight  Troy town they say is now a grassgrown field  That long withstood the force of Grecian might  And castles fall tho' deep in earth empight  Ne ought so strong is found but what may fail  The sun at last shall lose his glorious light  And vows or bribes o'er women may prevail  Their hearts are made of flesh and mortal flesh is frail  III  With heavy heart and full of cark I go  And take my congé of my blooming maid  I kiss'd her hond and louting very low  To her behest at length myself array'd  The fair we love expects to be obey'd  Altho' she bid us with the kestrel fly  So forth I prick tho' much by doubt dismay'd  The hard experiment resolv'd to try  For she was wond'rous fair and much in love was I  IV  A grove I reach'd where tuneful throstles sung  The linnet here did ope his little throat  His twitting jests around the cuckoo flung  And the proud goldsinch show'd his painted coat  And hail'd us with no inharmonious note  The robin eke here tun'd his sonnet shrill  And told the soothing ditty all by rote  How he with leaves his pious beak did fill  To shroud those pretty babes whom Sib unkind would kill  V  And many a fair Narcissus deck'd the plain  That seem'd anew their passions to admire  Here Ajax told his dolors o'er again  And am'rous Clytie sicken'd with desire  Here the blown rose her odors sweet did spire  Thro' the dun grove a murm'ring river led  His chrystal streams that wound in many a gyre  The baleful willow all the banks bespread  And ever to the breeze ycurl'd his hoary head  VI  Soon to the grove there came a lovely maid  For maiden sure she did to me appear  In plain checklaton was the nymph array'd  Her sparkling eyes stood full of many a tear  And she bewept the absence of her dear  Alas should beauty be to woe allay'd  Beauty methinks should meet with better cheer  Content should never wander from her side  Good luck I pray to heav'n the face that's fair betide  VII  "Ah woe is me she cry'd since Colin's fled  "Whose gentle presence did these plains adorn  "Soon was he ravish'd from the nuptial bed  "Torn from these arms from his dear leman torn  "O grief far sharper than the pointed thorn  "I saw him illbestad by martial band  "Alas the day that ever I was born  "Where roves my Colin on what foreign strand  "Arraught from Laura's eyes and his dear native land  VIII  "Alas he only knew to prune the vine  "Or thro' the earth to urge the biting share  "To twist the bower with fragrant eglantine  "Where free from heat we shun'd the noontide air  "Or to the mart to lead his fleecy care  "And is it fit in hacqueton and mail  "The youth for war's grim terrors should prepare  "His voice outsung the lovelorn nightingale  "And destly could he daunce or pipe along the dale  IX  "The goshawk fierce may pounce the trembling dove  "The savage wolf may tear the bounding fawn  "But sparrows mild are form'd for seats of love  "And kids dew not with blood the slow'ry lawn  "Then how shall he in whom all graces dawn  "In the red field the cruel paynim kill  "For scenes like these find men of hellish spawn  "'Tis his with joy the virgin's heart to fill  'And not on foreign shore his foemen's blood to spill  X  "No days of bliss my sorrows shall aslake  "For him I'll ever drop the dol'rous tear  "Adieu the circled green the buxom wake  "Since Colin's gone I taste of nought but drear  "Stretch me ye maidens stretch me on the bier  "And let thy gravestone these true words adorn  "A wretched maiden lies intombed here  "Who saw a shepherd brighter than the morn  "Then pin'd her heart away and dy'd of love forlorn"  XI  Much was I grieved at her piteous plaint  And greeted to myself O happy Squire  At length tho' late thou hast found out a saint  Who but for Colin feels no warm desire  Perdie quoth Satyrane I her admire  No lozel lose shall here discover'd be  The other answer'd with his cheeks on fire  Now by my hallidom you soon shall see  That words may with the heart full often ill agree  XII  I nought accoy'd came up unto the fair  And swore to love her all my length of life  Then offer'd her to gorgeous domes to bear  Where haidegives are daunc'd to harp and fife  She soon forgot she was another's wife  And granted with me to desert the plain  Are such ensamples emong women rife  If so my Columbel I ne'er shall gain  But hunt around the world and find my labours vain  XIII  My lips I 'gan to royne in fell despite  And forth I rushed from her false embrace  Thro' the thick wood I wander'd day and night  Ne met I living creature face to face  At length a rising city far I trace  Thither in hopes my hasty steps I bend  Perchaunce thought I true Virtue may embrace  The courtly dome and from the country wend  Thus where the least expect we often find a friend  XIV  At e'en the town I reach'd and eke a hall  Which waxen tapers made as light as day  Fair jovisaunce sat on the face of all  And to the daunce the sprightly minstrels play  Each seem'd as sportive as the wanton jay  The dame who own'd the house was passing old  And had it seems that morning dealt away  To her kind grandson many bags of gold  Who took a bonnibel to haven and to hold  XV  The bride was named Viola the fair  The loaded rosiere is not half so sweet  Aye aye quoth I ensamples are but rare  To find so many charms in one discreet  With you fair lass I mean not now to treat  The springal was in wholesom lustihed  And him by name of Pamphilus they greet  He was to doughty chevisance ybred  Yet oft in courtly halls the active measure led  XVI  The auncient dame they do Avara call  And much she hobbled as she trod the ground  Yet many angels in her crumenal  If fair report speaks true were always found  Where riches flow there virtues too abound  Her pannikel was as a badger grey  And as she walk'd the company around  It nodded with such force that by my fay  I thought it meant to fly from her old crag away  XVII  The lofty roof was fretted o'er with gold  And all around the walls depeinten were  With many histories of times of old  Which brought not muchel credit to the fair  There Leda held her swan with shoulders bare  And here the dame of Ephesus was found  Lick other dames whom my kind tongue shall spare  And here stood Helen for her charms renown'd  Who soon her lord forsook when she a leman found  XVIII  And many a beauteous dame and courtly knight  Came there the nuptials to celebrate  Some vers'd to wing from bow the nimble flight  Some the near foe with brondir'n to amate  Me too they welcome to the hall of state  With bel acoil they wished me to take  A round or two and chuse me out a mate  But my fond love which nothing could aslake  Caus'd me to slight them all for Columbella's sake  XIX  And now to artful steps the floor rebounds  In graceful ease the shining beavys move  The noice like thunder at a distance sounds  Mean time I sat beneath a proud alcove  And told Avara gentle tales of love  Thought I in eld the passions are more tame  And here by craft I may successful prove  For she perforce must now be void of blame  As wise Ulysses' wife Penelopé by name  XX  Ne wants she gelt which oft the mind misleads  To actions which it otherwise would shun  The courtier lythe if right report areeds  Will unawhap'd to seize his vantage run  And so will most men underneath the sun  Or be they patriot call'd or bard or knight  But when they once the gilded prize have won  They seek to clear their name with shame bedight  Befits to scour the steel when rust offends the sight  XXI  At ev'ry word I said she look'd askaunce  Then said in unsoot whispers Fye Sir fye  And turn'd as tho' she seem'd to mind the daunce  Nathless on me she cast a languid eye  Blist by thy form my liefest life quoth I  Cast your belgards upon an humble slave  From love alass in vain my heart would fly  Then with a word thy quailing leman save  For if you frown perdie you doom me to the grave  XXII  It hap'd by chaunce she saw a golden heart  With flaming diamonds around beset  This the whole guerdon of my tedious smart  I on a time from Columbel did get  As simple birds are caught in fowler's net  And 'cause they see no danger none they fear  Ev'n so Avara her eyen here did set  And turned round and whisper'd in mine ear  ive me that di'mond heart and be mine leman dear  XXIII  I started from the couch where I was pight  And thus I her bespake with muchel rage  Avaunt thou faytor false thou imp of night  I hate myself that I should thus engage  On any terms to treat with wrizled age  So forth I flung and left the frowy witch  To share her bed with coachman groom or page  The castle too I quit mine ire was sich  nd out I set again tho' night was dark as pitch  XXIV  But did I here relate Sir Satyrane  The many weary miles I've travelled  What dangers I've assoil'd yet all in vain  For by my truth but ill my days I've sped  Your hair would stand upright upon your head  Three hundred virtuous females side by side  By me to Columbella must be led  Can you direct me where for such to ride  cannot in good sooth the courteous knight reply'd  XXV  The Squire pursu'd his tale 'Tis now three years  Since curst Avara's visage first I saw  Convents I've try'd but there the luscious freers  The fairfac'd nuns to fornication draw  Nor palaces are free from Cupid's law  His darts are fiercer than the levinbrond  Few very few there 'scape his mighty paw  And those in golden palls who proudly stond  Had lever kiss their love's than Keysar's royal hond  XXVI  Fair Jenny of the mill I strove to win  And her benempt Pastora of the dale  But they bilive agreed with me to sin  One ask'd an owch and one a watchet veil  Some wish o'er ev'ry female to prevail  My hope my conquest is to be deny'd  The stage I've try'd but there my projects fail  For there is scarce a single wedded bride  But doth her husband's noul with horns of ront provide  XXVII  As couthful fishers at the benty brook  By various arts assot the seely fry  Now wriggling worms now paste conceals the hook  And now they hide it with a colour'd fly  This takes the perch and that the tench's eye  So different nymphs a diff'rent charm invites  Some yield for vantage some for vanity  A song this one a daunce that maid delights  Man throws the wimble bait and greedy woman bites  XXVIII  With sorrow overhent the other day  I laid my weary limbs adown to rest  Where a tall beech o'erspread the dusky way  My noyous thoughts a dream awhile suppress'd  Oft weighty truths are in this garb ydress'd  Grant that it so may happy unto me  Then joyous once again shall sooth this breast  My pining soul shall be from anguish free  And I shall taste true bliss dear Columbel with thee  XXIX  Methought I saw a figure fair and tall  And gentle smiles sat dimpling on her face  Yet seemed of a beauty nought at all  'Till much beholding did improve each grace  At length she seem'd too fair for human race  Her kirtle white might vie with winter snows  Ne could you ought of her fair bosom trace  Nought but her face would she to sight expose  o modest maiden wends the frannion muchel shows  XXX  With visage bland methought she hail'd me oft  "Ne fear quoth she a female's mild request  "The bark by tempests that is whirl'd aloft  "At length the tempest o'er enjoyeth rest  "My name is Chastity tho' out of quest  "With modern dames yet thou shalt still survey  "A clime where beauty is with virtue blest  "Good fortune speed you on your happy way  "Go gentle Squire of Dames and here no longer stay  XXXI  "To Fairy lond your instant journey bend  "There Columbel may find her will obey'd  "There Chastity may boast of many a friend  "She visits there each rosyfeatur'd maid  "Go on nor be by former toils affray'd  "Go where yon oaks display their verdant pride  "'Till from the mountains torn and stripp'd of shade  "On Neptune's billows they triumphant ride  "Protect their happy lond and conquer all beside  XXXII  "Hail happy lond for arms and arts renown'd  "For blooming virgins free from loose desire  "A Drake a Bacon there a birthplace found  "And chaste Eliza time shall e'er admire  "The hero wields the sword and poet's lyre  "This Sidney knew who still with lustre shines  "For whom Dan Spenser wak'd the warbling quire  "And many more whose names might grace his lines  "There round the warriour's palm the lover's myrtle twines"  XXXIII  At this I woke and now resolve to brave  The utmost perils for my Columbel  For know I mean to cross the briny wave  Where Albion's chalky cliffs the sea repel  And if no mage have laid a magick spell  Perchaunce my lot may be at length to find  Three hundred nymphs who wicked love can quell  If not I must desert all womankind  And what me most amates leave Columbel behind  XXXIV  The Squire of Dames surceased here his say  And forth he yode to seek the British isle  Sir Satyrane prick'd on his dapplegrey  Ne ought foreswonk he travell'd many a mile  To spend his days in hardiment and toil  But first in courteous guise they bid farewell  As well befits men bred in courtly soil  Now how the Squire has sped or ill or well  A future canto may perhaps at leisure tell  XXXV  For see how Phoebus welketh in the west  My oxen from their yoke I must untye  The collar much has chauf'd their tender chest  Who labours much the sweets of rest should try  To their warm nests the daws and ravens fly  Deep in the ruin'd dome or dusky wood  And beasts and birds fast lock'd in slumber lye  Save the fell bat that flutters out for food  And the soothsaying owl with her unlovely brood  CANTO II  ARGUMENT  The Squire he lights on  Bonvivant  Who wons in  Fairy  soil  Then views in  Merlin  's magick glass  A sight that ends his toil  I  TO gain the point to which our soul aspires  We nourish toil and reek hard labour sweet  For this thro' Greenland's frosts or India's fires  The hardy sailors death and dangers meet  And the prow chieftain bolder than discreet  In blood imbru'd pursues the martial fray  And lovers eke thro' life's loud tempests beat  Led on by hope that neverdying ray  Hope wantons in their breast and strews with flow'rs the way  II  And sure of all mankind the Squire of Dames  Shall stand the first ensample of true love  Who aye untouch'd by any foreign flames  Preserv'd his passion for his gentle dove  Blush modern youths whose pulses quickly move  Fondly you glote upon the witching fair  Yet when a sweet enjoyment once you prove  You leave the nymph intangled in the snare  Her tears flow trickling down her singults pierce the air  III  Oh think of transports which ye whilom tasted  And let the glad remembrance charm your mind  Be not the fruits of joyment quickly wasted  And to your heart her happy image bind  Think what she merits who whilear was kind  Nor by inconstancy her peace destroy  Inconstancy that monster fell and blind  That vainly fond of ev'ry passing toy  Treads down its late delight and poisons rapt'rous joy  IV  Return we now unto our gentle youth  Whose little bark daunc'd lightly on the main  His breast divided atween joy and ruth  Now gay ideas wanton in his brain  Now woebegon his heart is rent in twain  On his success depends his Columbel  And now he hopes and now desponds again  The various turns of mind when thoughts rebel  Sure pen mote ne'er describe and none but lovers tell  V  Methinks I see him on the beachy strond  Where Neptune's waves affrap the sturdy pier  His hardy steed neighs at the sight of lond  In all adventures a most faithful seer  And thro' that city he doth quickly steer  Which Ethelbert to holy Austin gave  The kings of Kent did erst inhabit here  Here haughty Becket sunk into the grave  Here thro' the smiling meads Stoure rolls his dimpling wave  VI  Long travell'd he ne ventur'd to assay  The nymphs he met for much he was affraid  To bribes or pray'rs few women would cry nay  At flatt'ry's tongue full oft will virtue fade  What shall he do to win his lovely maid  He must three hundred virtuous females find  Perdie quoth he my fortune be essay'd  I'll boldly try the strength of womankind  For craven heart they say ne'er won fair lady's mind  VII  So on he prick'd and from a rising ground  Discern'd before him in a distant vale  A castle fair and auncient oaks around  Did to the breeze their lofty heads avail  A silver stream refresh'd the fragrant dale  Their ledden loud fat oxen did repeat  And nibbling sheep display'd their fleeces pale  The woodbine shed an odor matchless sweet  And to their patient dams the frisking lambkins bleat  VIII  To that same castle our advent'rer yode  The merry birds him welcom'd on the way  An hundred flow'rs aumail'd the winding road  And all was bright and all was passing gay  You would have sworn it was the month of May  Withouten drad he thunders at the gate  Who wons within or giant knight or fay  Shall ne'er in sooth our imp of fame amate  Unto the summons loud the portal opens streit  IX  And forth there issued the seneschal  Of middle age he was if right I ween  He was in personage both plump and tall  Ne seemed he to taste of dol'rous teen  Ne wrinkle deep was on his forehead seen  But jovisaunce sat basking on his brow  At every word he spoke he smil'd atween  His temples were ycrown'd with myrtle bough  And virelays he song with matchless grace I vow  X  "Whoe'er thou art thrice welcome to these plains  "Where bitter dole ne'er shows her hateful head  "Goodfellowship wons here and free from pains  "Both youth and eld the paths of pleasure tread  "Catch flying bliss ne be by ought foresaid  "Think that this life is but a little span  "Then laugh and sport and shun all dreryhed  "Thy rolling days in present pleasures plan  "Come spend thy hours in joy thou son of mortal man  XI  "Know'st thou my name I am l'Allegro hight  "Let me conduct thee to our jovial hall  "Where Bonvivant in revels spends the night  "Who bids a hearty welcome unto all  "Or wear he red crossstoles or paynim pall"  With that he lad him with a courtly air  Into a chamber deck'd for feast and ball  And tho' no tedes or tapers glimmer'd there  Yet all within was bright as all without was fair  XII  As at the close of an hot summer's day  When Phoebus in the west deserts the sky  Bright streams of light along the aether play  And tho' his fi'ry orb forsake our eye  The beamy gushes gild each object nigh  The painted meads are ting'd with golden light  And rivers roll their glitt'ring waters by  So in this house of joy with ease you might  Perceive celestial rays that cherish'd human sight  XIII  The Squire of Dames his jolly host salew'd  And Bonvivant his hond in friendship press'd  "Come sit thee down and taste our choicest food  "We entertake quoth he no vulgar guest  "Enur'd to toil come taste the sweets of rest  "Doff thy hard arms this samite garment wear  "This better far than mail shall bind thy breast  "This coronal shall deck thy auburn hair  "Push the brisk goblet round and drown intruding care  XIV  "For us the lark attunes his morning song  "For us the spring depeints her ev'ry flow'r  "To sooth our sleep yon fountain purls along  "And oaks to shade us twine into a bow'r  "The pensive bard sits many a watchful hour  "In ditty sweet to carol forth our praise  "While valour spends his days in dole and stour  "We wiser we undying trophies raise  "To everblooming bliss ne reek what wisdom says  XV  "With sprightly notes we make the welkin ring  "In mazy daunce we tread the chequer'd ground  "To yielding nymphs transported shepherds sing  "Ne hard misfare emongst our train is found  "The simple swain who looks with cark astoun'd  "Because his leman ill rewards his care  "Oh let him stond to all a lout renown'd  "Ne gibing scorn her twitting bords forbear  "Are there not other nymphs less coy and full as fair"  XVI  At this the Squire wex'd pale "Ne eath it is  "Most courteous knight he cry'd far to remove  "The thoughts of her in whom we place all bliss"  Quoth Bonvivant "What then thou art in love"  "That I am so these many singults prove"  Return'd the Squire L'Allegro then reply'd  "Thou'dst better wend to yonder willow grove  "Where shoals of lovers hanging side by side  "Feed the vile carrion crows and highten female pride"  XVII  With that he brast into a scornful laugh  And much abash'd appear'd our constant Squire  The others sportful the brisk vintage quaff  While thus the springal "Yes I do aspire  "To love the fairest of the female quire  "Three hundred virtuous damsels in this isle  "I came to find" "Perdie your odd desire  "Quoth Bonvivant will ask thee muchel toil  "And thou shalt travel too full many a weary mile  XVIII  "'Tis not enough the conduct of the fair  "Is form'd by frowning virtue's strictest leer  "The blatantbeast does here in pieces tear  "The fame of those ybred in school severe  "His rankling tongue throughout the rolling year  "With baleful venom ev'ry thing consumes  "Where beauty's splendor gilds our northern sphere  "He slyly creeps and to destruction dooms  "The honour of the spring and wisdom's early blooms  XIX  "The brindled lyon in the lonely wood  "Hides his grim aspect from the sight of men  "The pardelis and libbard's spotted brood  "Reside contented in sequester'd den  "Not so the blatantbeast he lives in ken  "Of the proud city or wellpeopled town  "Thence with detested fury he will ren  "Ne spare the prelate's lawn or monarch's crown  "All fares alike with him for all he tumbleth down  XX  "What then avails it to be fair or wise  "Or what avails it to be warlike knight  "Wheree'er the monster casts his fi'ry eyes  "Each grace each virtue sickens at the sight  "Then goodly Squire until the morning's light  "Quaff the thick darkness of the night away  "And when the morn shall rise in arms bedight  "Proceed and luck attend you on your way  "Algates we wish in truth with us you'd ever stay"  XXI  The Squire agrees but vows when rising morn  Shall gild the glitt'rand portals of the east  Himself he will in habergeon adorn  And seek around the isle the blatantbeast  Mean while in buxom mirth they spend the feast  Ill fares the mortal man too much who knows  Oft shall he wish himself from thought releast  The fatal knowledge in his bosom glows  And mars his golden rest and murders soft repose  XXII  Sir Chaunticleer now ey'd the rising day  And call'd dame Partlet from her vetchy bed  Now wakeful Phospher spreads his gleamy ray  And the pale moon conceal'd her silver head  The cattle brouze the lawn with dew bespread  While ev'ry bird from out the buskets flies  Then to the field our lover issued  But sleep had seal'd l'Allegro's drousy eyes  And Bonvivant also in downy slumber lies  XXIII  Our Squire withouten drad pursu'd his way  And look'd around to spy this monster fell  And many a well conceited roundelay  He sung in honour of his Columbel  Mote he perchaunce destroy this spawn of hell  How easy were the task to him assign'd  The lond of Fairy doth each lond excel  View there the paragons of womankind  View the bright virgins there and leave thy heart behind  XXIV  Ah lever should'st thou try the females there  Than thus unwise another course pursue  There ev'ry nymph is innocent as fair  Try what I here advance you'll find it true  Hard is our fate while bliss in hopes we sew  Some deadly fiend to blast our joy appears  Contentment sweet alas is known to few  Thus for awhile the sun the welkin chears  But soon he hides his head and melts in dropping tears  XXV  Life is a scene of conteck and distress  Ne is it longer than a winter's day  And shall we make our few enjoyments less  Far from my cot thou blatantbeast away  No husband's noul will I with horns array  Ne shall my tongue its venom'd malice wreak  On tuneful bards whom laurel crowns apay  Ne will I 'gainst the comely matron speak  Or draw one pearly drop down beauty's rosy cheek  XXVI  The Squire of Dames rode on with muchel tine  And as he cast askaunce his greedy look  He saw empight beneath an auncient pine  A hoary shepherd leaning on his crook  His falling tears increas'd the swelling brook  And he did sigh as he would break his heart  "O thou deepread in sorrow's baleful book  "The Squire exclaim'd areed thy burning smart  "Our dolors grow more light when we the tale impart"  XXVII  To whom the swain reply'd "O gentle youth  "Yon fruitful meads my num'rous herds possess'd  "My days roll'd on unknown to pain or ruth  "And one fair daughter my old age ybless'd  "Oh had you seen her for the wake ydress'd  "With kirtle ty'd with many a colour'd string  "Thy tongue to all the world had then confess'd  "That she was sheener than the pheasant's wing  "And when she rais'd her voice ne lark so soot could sing  XXVIII  "In virtue's thews I bred the lovely maid  "And she right well the lessons did pursue  "Too wise she was to be by man betray'd  "But the curst blatantbeast her form did view  "And round our plains did spread a tale untrue  "That Rosabella spurning marriage band  "Had felt those pangs which virgin never knew  "And that Sir Topas my poor girl trepann'd  "He who in sable stole doth in our pulpit stand  XXIX  "Nay more the hellish monster has invented  "How a young swain on Shannon's banks yborn  "Had not my care the deeplaid plot prevented  "Would from my arms my Rosabel have born  "Have I not cause to weep from rising morn  "'Till Phoebus welketh in the western main  "To see my dearling's fame thus vildly torn  "Have I not cause to nourish endless pain"  t this he deeply figh'd and wept full sore again  XXX  "Curst be this blatantbeast reply'd the Squire  "That thus infects your seabegirted isle  "Shew me his face that I may wreak mine ire  "Upon this imp of hell this monster vile"  "Away from hence not passing sure a mile  "Might I advise you you had better wend"  Return'd the swain "Deepread in magickstyle  "There Merlin wons sue him to be your friend  "And lest you miss your way myself will you attend"  XXXI  Together now they seek the hermitage  Deep in the covert of a dusky glade  Where in his dortour wons the hoary sage  The mossgrown trees did form a gloomy shade  Their rustling leaves a solemn musick made  And fairies nightly tripp'd the aweful green  And if the tongue of fame have truth display'd  Full many a spectre was at midnight seen  Torn from his earthly grave a horrid sight I ween  XXXII  Ne rose ne vi'let glads the chearless bow'r  Ne fringed pink from earth's green bosom grew  But hemlock dire and ev'ry baleful flow'r  Might here be found and knots of mystick rue  Close to the cell sprong up an auncient yew  And store of imps were on its boughs ypight  At his behests they from its branches flew  And in a thousand various forms bedight  Frisk'd to the moon's pale wain and revell'd all the night  XXXIII  Around the cave a clustring ivy spread  In wide embrace his overtwining arms  Within the walls with characters bespread  Declar'd the pow'rful force of magick charms  Here drugs were plac'd destructive of all harms  And books that deep futurity could scan  Here stood a spell that of his rage disarms  The mountain lyon 'till he yields to man  ith many secrets more which scarce repeat I can  XXXIV  The Squire of Dames deep enters in the cell  What will not valiant heart for beauty dare  His borrel fere here bids his friend farewell  And home he wends renewing cark and care  When louting low with a becoming air  The youth cry'd out "O thrice renowned mage  "Vouchsafe to cure me of my black dispair  "For thou not only art grown wise thro' age  But art of mortal man by far the wisest sage"  XXXV  Then Merlin with a look benign reply'd  For he was bred with ev'ry courteous thew  "I know to make fair Columbel your bride  "The blatantbeast you thro' the lond pursue  "The fate of empires now demands my view  "And for awhile denys my presence here  "Soon in this cell I'll thee again salew  "What most thou lik'st partake withouten fear  "Share all my cave affords nor think I grudge my chear  XXXVI  "Yet mark my counsel open not that door  "Lest thou repent thy follies when too late  "Ten thousand pangs shall make thy heart full sore  "For horror scouls behind that heben gate  "And future ills shall thy dear peace amate  "There stands a mirror wrought by magick leer  "In which are read the dark decrees of fate  "And whom you wish to see will streit appear  "Devoid of art's false mask to human eyesight clear  XXXVII  "Ah how unlike the godlike man he seem'd  "In this my glass the patriot I've descry'd  "By the vile rabblement a saint esteem'd  "He's oft a wretch compos'd of sloth and pride  "And Kesars too not seldom deify'd  "With other men their vice and follies share  "And by my mirror if the nymph be try'd  "It will without reserve the truth declare  "Ne flatter head that's crown'd ne flatter face that's fai  XXXVIII  "Once more let me advise thee gentle Squire  "Forbear to look at this same magick glass  "Do not too rashly into fate enquire  "But I to foreign stronds awhile must pass"  Th' unweeting youth cry'd to himself "Alas  "Would I could know the lot to me assign'd"  "Patience quoth Merlin doth all things surpass"  Then to his car were winged dragons join'd  With which he sails thro' air and far outstrips the wind  XXXIX  And now the Squire surveys the lonesome cave  His wav'ring mind is in a whirlwind tost  And now the mirror he resolves to brave  And now he finds his boasted courage lost  At length determin'd whatsoe'er it cost  To see the glass he darts into the cell  And lest his eyes by vild retrait be crost  Thrice he invokes his lovely Columbel  As Adam fell of yore the Squire of Dames yfell  XL  The heben doors full widely he display'd  And saw the lovely queen of all his heart  Fair as the lilly in the watry glade  Bright as the morn and bright withouten art  Thro' ev'ry vein he feels a thrillant smart  For the dear maid lay on her bed undress'd  And may I unreprov'd the truth impart  She hugg'd a lusty stripling to her breast  Whom she full closely clipp'd and wantonly caress'd  XLI  "O faytor false O wicked imp of night  Exclaim'd the Squire astound "ah wealaway  "Let Erebus in pitchy stole bedight  "With foulest sprites the sons of men affray  "And blot for ever the fair face of day  "Ye haggard sisters sound my passingbell  "Oh ne'er believe ye youths what women say  "O losel loose O impious Columbel"  Then like a stean to earth full heavily he fell  XLII  There shall we leave him for my leaky boat  Lets in the water and I must recure  Her muchworn hulk that scarcely now can float  And moor'd in harbour she shall ride secure  Then if I can a pilot wise procure  Mayhap I may again hoist forth my sail  And other hardy voyages endure  Thro' shelves and shallows now the adverse gale  Gives me some time to rest and lond with

SAMUEL JOHNSON  LET  Ver    observation with extensive view  Survey mankind from China to Peru  Remark each anxious toil each eager strife  And watch the busy scenes of crowded life  Then say how hope and fear desire and hate  O'erspread with snares the clouded maze of fate  Where wav'ring man betray'd by vent'rous pride  To tread the dreary paths without a guide  As treach'rous phantoms in the mist delude  Shuns fancied ills or chases airy good  How rarely reason guides the stubborn choice  Rules the bold hand or prompts the suppliant voice  How nations sink by darling schemes oppress'd  When vengeance listens to the fool's request  Fate wings with ev'ry wish th' afflictive dart  Each gift of nature and each grace of art  With fatal heat impetuous courage glows  With fatal sweetness elocution flows  Impeachment stops the speaker's pow'rful breath  And restless fire precipitates on death  Ver    But scarce observ'd the knowing and the bold  Fall in the gen'ral massacre of gold  Widewasting pest that rages unconfin'd  And crowds with crimes the records of mankind  For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws  For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws  Wealth heap'd on wealth nor truth nor safety buys  The dangers gather as the treasures rise  Let hist'ry tell where rival kings command  And dubious title shakes the madded land  When statues glean the refuse of the sword  How much more safe the vassal than the lord  Low sculks the hind beneath the rage of pow'r  And leaves the wealthy traytor in the Tow'r  Untouch'd his cottage and his slumbers sound  Tho' confiscation's vulturs hover round  The needy traveller serene and gay  Walks the wild heath and sings his toil away  Does envy seize thee crush th' upbraiding joy  Increase his riches and his peace destroy  New fears in dire vicissitude invade  The rustling brake alarms and quiv'ring shade  Nor light nor darkness bring his pain relief  One shews the plunder and one hides the thief  Yet  Ver    still one gen'ral cry the skies assails  And gain and grandeur load the tainted gales  Few know the toiling statesman's fear or care  Th' insidious rival and the gaping heir  Once  Ver    more Democritus arise on earth  With chearful wisdom and instructive mirth  See motly life in modern trappings dress'd  And feed with varied fools th' eternal jest  Thou who couldst laugh where want enchain'd caprice  Toil crush'd conceit and man was of a piece  Where wealth unlov'd without a mourner dy'd  And scarce a sycophant was fed by pride  Where ne'er was known the form of mock debate  Or seen a newmade mayor's unwieldy state  Where change of fav'rites made no change of laws  And senates heard before they judg'd a cause  How wouldst thou shake at Britain's modish tribe  Dart the quick taunt and edge the piercing gibe  Attentive truth and nature to decry  And pierce each scene with philosophic eye  To thee were solemn toys or empty shew  The robes of pleasure and the veils of woe  All aid the farce and all thy mirth maintain  Whose joys are causeless or whose griefs are vain  Such was the scorn that fill'd the sage's mind  Renew'd at ev'ry glance on humankind  How just that scorn ere yet thy voice declare  Search every state and canvass ev'ry prayer  Ver    Unnumber'd suppliants crowd Preferment's gate  Athirst for wealth and burning to be great  Delusive Fortune hears th' incessant call  They mount they shine evaporate and fall  On ev'ry stage the foes of peace attend  Hate dogs their flight and insult mocks their end  Love ends with hope the sinking statesman's door  Pours in the morning worshipper no more  For growing names the weekly scribbler lies  To growing wealth the dedicator flies  From every room descends the painted face  That hung the bright Palladium of the place  And smoak'd in kitchens or in auctions sold  To better features yields the frame of gold  For now no more we trace in ev'ry line  Heroic worth benevolence divine  The form distorted justifies the fall  And detestation rids th' indignant wall  But will not Britain hear the last appeal  Sign her foes doom or guard her fav'rites zeal  Tho' Freedom's sons no more remonstrance rings  Degrading nobles and controuling kings  Our supple tribes repress their patriot throats  And ask no questions but the price of votes  With weekly libels and septennial ale  Their wish is full to riot and to rail  In fullblown dignity see Wolsey stand  Law in his voice and fortune in his hand  To him the church the realm their pow'rs consign  Thro' him the rays of regal bounty shine  Still to new heights his restless wishes tow'r  Claim leads to claim and pow'r advances pow'r  'Till conquest unresisted ceas'd to please  And rights submitted left him none to seize  At length his sov'reign frowns the train of state  Mark the keen glance and watch the sign to hate  Wheree'er he turns he meets a stranger's eye  His suppliants scorn him and his followers fly  At once is lost the pride of aweful state  The golden canopy the glitt'ring plate  The regal palace the luxurious board  The liv'ried army and the menial lord  With age with cares with maladies oppress'd  He seeks

shifting gleam of morning light  The colours shifted of her rainbow vest  Imperial ensigns grac'd her smiling form  A golden key and golden wand she bore  This charms to peace each sullen eastern

with her glories past  Vain hope no more in choral bands unite  Her virgin vot'ries and at early dawn  Sacred to May and Love's mysterious rite  Brush the light dewdrops  Alluding to the country

loud carol and the sportive dance  Sudden in pensive sadness droop'd her head  Faint on her cheeks the blushing crimson dy'd  "O chaste victorious triumphs whither fled  "My maiden honours whither gone" she cry'd  Ah once to fame and bright dominion born  The Earth and smiling Ocean saw me rise  With time coeval and the star of morn  The first the fairest daughter of the skies  Then when at heav'n's prolific mandate sprung  The radiant beam of newcreated day  Celestial harps to airs of triumph strung  Hail'd the glad dawn and angels call'd me MAY  Space in her empty regions heard the

Love's enchanting wiles  Saw the mild Graces in my train appear  And infant Beauty brighten in my smiles  No Winter frown'd In sweet embrace ally'd  Three sister Seasons danc'd th' eternal green  And

native heav'n  I fled and flying saw the Deluge rage  Saw bursting clouds eclipse the noontide beams  While sounding billows from the mountains roll'd  With bitter waves polluting all my streams  My nectar'd streams that flow'd on sands of gold  Then vanquish'd many a seagirt isle and grove  Their forests floating on the wat'ry plain  Then fam'd for arts and laws deriv'd from Jove  My Atalantis

ravish'd honours and to her belong  My choral dances and victorious games  To her my garlands and triumphal song  O say what yet untasted bounties flow  What purer joys await her gentler reign  Do lillies fairer vi'lets sweeter blow  And warbles Philomel a softer strain  Do morning suns in ruddier glory rise  Does ev'ning fan her with serener gales  Do clouds drop fatness from the wealthier skies  Or wantons Plenty in her happier vales  Ah no the blunted beams of dawning light  Skirt the pale orient with uncertain day  And Cynthia riding on the car of night  Thro' clouds embattled faintly wins her way  Pale immature the blighted verdure springs  Nor mounting juices feed the swelling flow'r  Mute all the groves nor Philomela sings  When Silence listens at the midnight hour  Nor wonder man that Nature's bashful face  And op'ning charms her rude embraces fear  Is she not sprung of April's wayward race  The sickly daughter of th' unripen'd year  With show'rs and sunshine in her fickle eyes  With hollow smiles proclaiming treach'rous peace  With blushes harb'ring in their thin disguise  The blast that riots on the Spring's increase  Is this the fair invested with my spoil  By Europe's laws and Senates' stern command  Ungen'rous Europe let me fly thy soil  And waft my treasures to a grateful land  Again revive on Asia's drooping shore  My Daphne's groves or Lycia's ancient plain  Again to Afric's sultry sands restore  Embow'ring shades and Lybian Amnion's fane  Or haste to northern Zembla's savage coast  There hush to silence elemental strife  Brood o'er the region of eternal Frost  And swell her barren womb with heat and life  Then Britain here she ceas'd Indignant grief  And parting pangs her fault'ring tongue supprest  Veil'd in an amber cloud she sought relief  And tears and silent anguish told the rest  SONG for RANELAGH  By Mr W WHITEHEAD  I  YE belles and ye flirts and ye pert little things  Who trip in this frolicksome round  Pray tell me from whence this indecency springs  The sexes at once to confound  What means the cock'd hat and the masculine air  With each motion design'd to perplex  Bright eyes were intended to languish not stare  And softness the test of your sex  II  The girl who on beauty depends for support  May call ev'ry art to her aid  The bosom display'd and the petticoat short  Are samples she gives of her trade  But you on whom Fortune indulgently smiles  And whom Pride has preserv'd from the snare  Should slily attack us with coyness and wiles  Not with open and insolent air  III  The Venus whose statue delights all mankind  Shrinks modestly back from the view  And kindly shou'd seem by the artist design'd  To serve as a model for you  Then learn with her beauties to copy her air  Nor venture too much to reveal  Our fancies will paint what you cover with care  And double each charm you conceal  IV  The blushes of Morn and the mildness of May  Are charms which no art can procure  Oh be but yourselves and our homage we pay  And your empire is solid and sure  But if Amazon like you attack your gallants  And put us in fear of our lives  You may do very well for sisters and aunts  But believe me you'll never be wives  The BENEDICITE Paraphrased  By the Rev Mr MERRICK  YE works of God on him alone  In earth his footstool heaven his throne  Be all your praise bestow'd  Whose hand the beauteous fabrick made

praise  Again yonr thankful voices raise  And touch the tuneful string  III  Praise him ye bless'd aetherial plains  Where in full majesty he deigns  To fix his aweful throne  Ye waters that above him roll  From orb to orb from pole to pole  Oh make his praises known  IV  Ye thrones dominions virtues pow'rs  Join ye your joyful songs with ours  With us your voices raise  From age to age extend the

shine  With light as far excelling thine  As thine the paler moon  VI  Ye glitt'ring planets of the sky  Whose lamps the absent sun supply  With him the song pursue  And let himself submissive own  He borrows from a brighter Sun  The light he lends to you  VII  Ye show'rs and dews whose moisture shed  Calls into life the op'ning seed  To him your praises yield  Whose influence wakes the genial birth  Drops fatness on the pregnant earth  And crowns the laughing field  VIII  Ye winds that oft tempestuous sweep  The ruffled surface of the deep  With us confess your God  See thro' the heav'ns the King of kings  Upborne on your expanded wings  Come flying all abroad  IX  Ye floods of fire wheree'er ye flow  With just submission humbly bow  To his superior pow'r  Who stops the tempest on its way  Or bids the flaming deluge stray  And gives it strength to roar  X  Ye summer's heat and winter's cold  By turns in long succession roll'd  The drooping world to chear  Praise him who gave the sun and moon  To lead the various seasons on  And guide the circling year  XI  Ye frosts that bind the wat'ry plain  Ye silent show'rs of fleecy rain  Pursue the heav'nly theme  Praise him who sheds the driving snow  Forbids the harden'd waves to flow  And stops the rapid stream  XII  Ye days and nights that swiftly born  From morn to eve from eve to morn  Alternate glide away  Praise him whose nevervarying light  Absent adds horror to the night  But present gives the day  XIII  Lightfrom whose rays all beauty springs  Darknesswhose wideexpanded wings  Involve the dusky globe  Praise him who when the heav'ns he spread  Darkness his thick pavilion made  And light his regal robe  XIV  Praise him ye light'nings as ye fly  Wing'd with his vengeance thro' the sky  And red with wrath divine  Praise him ye clouds that wand'ring stray  Or fix'd by him in close array  Surround his aweful shrine  XV  Exalt O earth thy heav'nly King  Who bids the plants that form the spring  With annual verdure bloom  Whose frequent drops of kindly rain  Prolific swell the rip'ning grain  And bless thy fertile womb  XVI  Ye mountains that ambitious rise  And heave your summits to the skies  Revere his aweful nod  Think how you once affrighted fled  When Jordan sought his fountainhead  And own'd th' approaching God  XVII  Ye trees that fill the rural scene  Ye flowers that o'er th' enamel'd green  In native beauty reign  O praise the Ruler of the skies  Whose hand the genial sap supplies  And clothes the smiling plain  XVIII  Ye secret springs ye gentle rills  That murm'ring rise among the hills  Or fill the humble vale  Praise him at whose almighty nod  The rugged rock dissolving flow'd  And form'd a springing well  XIX  Praise him ye floods and seas profound  Whose waves the spacious earth surround  And roll from shore to shore  Aw'd by his voice ye seas subside  Ye floods within your channels glide  And tremble and adore  XX  Ye whales that stir the boiling deep  Or in its dark recesses sleep  Remote from human eye  Praise him by whom ye all are fed  Praise him without whose heavenly aid  Ye languish faint and die  XXI  Ye birds exalt your Maker's name  Begin and with th' important theme  Your artless lays improve  Wake with your songs the rising day  Let musick sound on ev'ry spray  And fill the vocal grove  XXII  Praise him ye beasts that nightly roam  Amid the solitary gloom  Th' expected prey to seize  Ye slaves of the laborious plough  Your stubborn necks submissive bow  And bend your weary'd knees  XXIII  Ye sons of men his praise display  Who stampt his image on your clay  And gave it pow'r to move  Yet that in Judah's confines dwell  From age to age successive tell  The wonders of his love  XXIV  Let Levi's tribe the lay prolong  'Till angels listen to the song  And bend attentive down  Let wonder seize the heav'nly train  Pleas'd while they hear a mortal strain  So sweet so like their own  XXV  And you your thankful voices join  That oft at Salem's sacred shrine  Before his altars kneel  Where thron'd in majesty he dwells  And from the mystick cloud reveals  The dictates of his will  XXVI  Ye spirits of the just and good  That eager for the blest abode  To heav'nly mansions soar  O let your songs his praise display  'Till heav'n itself shall melt away  And time shall be no more  XXVII  Praise him ye meek and humble train  Ye saints whom his decrees ordain  The boundless bliss to share  O praise him 'till ye take your way  To regions of eternal day  And reign for ever there  XXVIII  Let us what now impassive stand  Aw'd by the tyrant's stern command  Amid the fiery blaze  While thus we triumph in the flame  Rise and our Maker's love proclaim  In hymns of endless praise  An ODE to FANCY  By the Same  FANCY whose delusions vain  Sport themselves with human brain  Rival thou of Nature's pow'r  Can'st from thy exhaustless store  Bid a tide of sorrow flow  And whelm the soul in deepest woe  Or in the twinkling of an eye  Raise it to mirth and jollity  Dreams and shadows by thee stand  Taught to run at thy command  And along the wanton air  Flit like empty Gossimer  Thee black Melancholy of yore  To the swiftwing'd Hermes bore  From the mixture of thy line  Different natures in thee join  Which thou chusest to express  By the variance of thy dress  Now like thy sire thou lov'st to seem  Light and gay with pinions trim  Dipt in all the dyes that glow  In the bend of Iris' bow  Now like thy mother drear and sad  All in mournful vestments clad  Cypress weeds and sable stole  Thou rushest on th' affrighted soul  Oft I feel thee coming on  When the night hath reach'd her noon  And darkness partner of her reign  Round the world hath bound her chain  Then with measur'd step and slow  In the churchyard path I go  And while my outward senses sleep  Lost in contemplation deep  Sudden I stop and turn my ear  And list'ning hear or think I hear  First a dead and sullen sound  Walks along the holy ground  Then thro' the gloom alternate break  Groans and the shrill screechowl's shriek  Lo the moon hath hid her head  And the graves give up their dead  By me pass the ghastly crowds  Wrapt in visionary shrouds  Maids who died with love forlorn  Youths who fell by maidens' scorn  Helpless sires and matrons old  Slain for sordid thirst of gold  And babes who owe their shorten'd date  To cruel stepdames ruthless hate  Each their sev'ral errands go  To haunt the wretch that wrought their woe  From their sight the caitiff flies  And his heart within him dies  While a horror damp and chill  Thro' his frozen blood doth thrill  And his hair for very dread  Bears itself upon his head  When the early breath of day  Hath made the shadows flee away  Still possess'd by thee I rove  Bosom'd in the shelt'ring grove  There with heart and lyre new strung  Meditate the lofty song  And if thou my voice inspire  And with wonted frenzy fire  Aided by thee I build the rhyme  Such as nor the flight of time  Nor wasting flame nor eating show'r  Nor lightning's blast can e'er devour  Or if chance some moral page  My attentive thoughts engage  On I walk with silent tread  Under the thickwoven shade  While the thrush unheeded by  Tunes her artless minstrelsy  List'ning to their sacred lore  I think on ages long past o'er  When Truth and Virtue hand in hand  Walk'd upon the smiling land  Thence my eyes on Britain glance  And awaken'd from my trance  While my busy thoughts I rear  Oft I wipe the falling tear  When the night again descends  And her shadowy cone extends  O'er the fields I walk alone  By the silence of the moon  Hark upon my left I hear  Wild musick wand'ring in the air  Led by the sound I onward creep  And thro' the neighb'ring hedge I peep  There I spy the Fairy band  Dancing on the level land  Now with step alternate bound  Join'd in one continu'd round  Now their plighted hands unbind  And such tangled mazes wind  As the quick eye can scarce pursue  And wou'd have puzzled that fam'd clue  Which led th' Athenian's unskill'd feet  Thro' the Labyrinth of Crete  At the near approach of day  Sudden the musick dies away  Wasting in the sea of air  And the phantoms disappear  All as the glowworm waxes dim  Vanish like a morning dream  And of their revels leave no trace  Save the ring upon the grass  When the elphin show is fled  Home I haste me to my bed  There if thou with magick wand  On my temples take thy stand  I see in mix'd disorder rise  All that struck my waking eyes  So when I stand and round me gaze  Where the fam'd Lodona strays  On the woods and thickets brown  That its sedgy margin crown  And watch the vagrant clouds that fly  Thro' the vast desart of the sky  When adown I cast my look  On the smooth unruffled brook  While its current clear doth run  And holds its mirrour to the sun  There I see th' inverted scene  Fall and meet the eye again  The MONKIES a TALE  By the Same  WHOE'ER with curious eye has rang'd  Thro' Ovid's tales has seen  How Jove incens'd to monkies chang'd  A tribe of worthless men  Repentant soon th' offending race  Intreat the injur'd pow'r  To give them back the human face  And reason's aid restore  Jove sooth'd at length his ear inclin'd  And granted half their pray'r  But t'other half he bade the wind  Disperse in empty air  Scarce had the thund'rer giv'n the nod  That shook the vaulted skies  With haughtier air the creatures strode  And stretch'd their dwindled size  The hair in curls luxuriant now  Around their temples spread  The tail that whilom hung below  Now dangled from the head  The head remains unchang'd within  Nor alter'd much the face  It still retains its native grin  And all its old grimace  Thus half transform'd and half the same  Jove bade them take their place  Restoring them their ancient claim  Among the human race  Man with contempt the brute survey'd  Nor would a name bestow  But woman lik'd the motley breed  And call'd the thing a Beau  An EPITAPH  QUAE te sub tenerâ rapuerunt Paeta juventâ  O utinam me crudelia fata vocent  Ut linquam terras invisaque lumina solis  Utque tuus rursum corpore sim posito  Tu cave Laethaeo contingas ore liquore  Et citò venturi sis memor oro viri  Te sequar obscurum per iter dux tibi eunti  Fidus amor tenebras lampade discutiens  Thus TRANSLATED  By the Same  THEE Paeta death's relentless hand  Cut off in earliest bloom  Oh had the fates for me ordain'd  To share an equal doom  With joy this busy world I'd leave  This hated light resign  To lay me in the peaceful grave  And be for ever thine  Do thou if Lethe court thy lip  To taste its stream forbear  Still in thy soul his image keep  Who hastes to meet thee there  Safe o'er the dark and dreary shore  In quest of thee I'll roam  Love with his lamp shall run before  And break the circling gloom  VERSES sent to Dean SWIFT on his Birthday with PINE'S HORACE finely bound  Written by Dr J SICAN  HORACE speaking  YOU'VE read Sir in poetic strain  How Varus and the Mantuan swain  Have on my birthday been invited  But I was forc'd in verse to write it  Upon a plain repast to dine  And taste my old Campanian wine  But I who all punctilio's hate  Tho' long familiar with the great  Nor glory in my reputation  Am come without an invitation  And tho' I'm us'd to right Falernian  I'll deign for once to taste Iernian  But fearing that you might dispute  Had I put on a common suit  My breeding and my politesse  I visit in a birthday dress  My coat of purest Turkeyred  With gold embroid'ry richly spread  To which I've sure as good pretensions  As Irish lords who starve on pensions  What tho' proud ministers of state  Did at your antichamber wait  What tho' your Oxfords and your St Johns  Have at your Levee paid attendance  And Peterborough and great Ormond  With many chiefs who now are dormant  Have laid aside the general's staff  And public cares with you to laugh  Yet I some friends as good can name  Nor less the darling sons of fame  For sure my Pollio and Mecaenas  Were as good statesman Mr Dean as  Either your Bolingbroke or Harley  Tho' they made Lewis beg a parley  And as for Mordaunt your lov'd hero  I'll match him with my Drusus Nero  You'll boast perhaps your fav'rite Pope  But Virgil is as good I hope  I own indeed I can't get any  To equal Helsham and Delany  Since Athens brought forth Socrates  A Grecian Isle Hippocrates  Since Tully liv'd before my time  And Galen bless'd another clime  You'll plead perhaps to my request  To be admitted as a guest  Your hearing's bad but why such fears  I speak to eyes and not to ears  And for that reason wisely took  The form you see me in a book  Attack'd by slowdevouring moths  By rage of barb'rous Huns and Goths  By Bentley's notes my deadliest foes  By Creech's rhimes and Dunster's prose  I found my boasted wit and fire  In their rude hands almost expire  Yet still they but in vain assail'd  For had their violence prevail'd  And in a blast destroy'd my fame  They wou'd have partly miss'd their aim  Since all my spirit in thy page  Defies the Vandals of this age  'Tis yours to save these small remains  From future pedants muddy brains  And fix my longuncertain fate  You best know howwhich waytranslate  VERSES written in a GARDEN  By Lady M W M  SEE how that pair of billing doves  With open murmurs own their loves  And heedless of censorious eyes  Pursue their unpolluted joys  No fears of future want molest  The downy quiet of their nest  No int'rest join'd the happy pair  Securely blest in Nature's care  While her dear dictates they pursue  For constancy is nature too  Can all the doctrine of our schools  Our maxims our religious rules  Can learning to our lives ensure  Virtue so bright or bliss so pure  The great Creator's happy ends  Virtue and pleasure ever blends  In vain the church and court have try'd  Th' united essence to divide  Alike they find their wild mistake  The pedant priest and giddy rake  AN ANSWER to a LOVELETTER  By the Same  IS it to me this sad lamenting strain  Are heaven's choicest gifts bestow'd in vain  A plenteous fortune and a beauteous bride  Your love rewarded gratify'd your pride  Yet leaving her'tis me that you pursue  Without one single charm but being new  How vile is man how I detest their ways  Of artful falshood and designing praise  Tasteless an easy happiness you slight  Ruin your joy and mischief your delight  Why should poor pug the mimic of your kind  Wear a rough chain and be to box confin'd  Some cup perhaps he breaks or tears a fan  While roves unpunish'd the destroyer man  Not bound by vows and unrestrain'd by shame  In sport you break the heart and rend the fame  Nor that your art can be successful here  Th' already plunder'd need no robber fear  Nor sighs nor charms nor flatteries can move  Too well secur'd against a second love  Once and but once that devil charm'd my mind  To reason deaf to observation blind  I idly hop'd what cannot love persuade  My fondness equal'd and my love repay'd  Slow to distrust and willing to believe  Long hush'd my doubts and did myself deceive  But oh too soonthis tale would ever last  Sleep sleep my wrongs and let me think 'em past  For you who mourn with counterfeited grief  And ask so boldly like a begging thief  May soon some other nymph inflict the pain  You know so well with cruel art to feign  Tho' long you sported have with Cupid's dart  You may see eyes and you may feel a heart  So the brisk wits who stop the evening coach  Laugh at the fear that follows their approach  With idle mirth and haughty scorn despise  The passenger's pale cheek and staring eyes  But seiz'd by Justice find a fright no jest  And all the terror doubled in their breast  In Answer to a LADY who advised RETIREMENT  By the Same  YOU little know the heart that you advise  I view this various scene with equal eyes  In crowded courts I find myself alone  And pay my worship to a nobler throne  Long since the value of this world I know  Pity the madness and despise the show  Well as I can my tedious part I bear  And wait for my dismission without fear  Seldom I mark mankind's detested ways  Not hearing censure nor affecting praise  And unconcern'd my future state I trust  To that sole Being merciful and just  An Address of the STATUES at STOWE to Lord COBHAM on his Return to his Gardens  FROM every Muse and every art thy own  Thy bow'rs our theatres thy mind our throne  Hail to thy virtues manumiz'd from state  Hail to thy leisure to be wisely great  Fetter'd by duties and to forms enslav'd  How timely have thy years a remnant sav'd  To taste that freedom which thy sword maintain'd  And lead in letter'd ease a life unpain'd  So Scipio Carthage fall'n resign'd his plume  And smil'd at the forgetfulness of Rome  O greatly bless'd whose evening sweetest shines  And in unclouded slowness calm declines  While free reflection with reverted eye  Wan'd from hot noontide and a troubled sky  Divides life well the largest part long known  Thy country's claim the last and best thy own  Here while detach'd thy selfsupported soul  Resumes dominion and escapes controul  Moves with a grandeur monarchs wish in vain  Above all fears storms dangers hopes or pain  A glance sometimes from thy safe summit show  And see the dusty world look dim below  Thro' the dark throng discern huge slaves of pride  Should'ring unheeded Happiness aside  Thwarted and push'd and lab'ring into name  And dignify'd with all the dirt of fame  Then with a smile superior turn away  And lop th' exub'rance of some straggling spray  Wind thro' thy mazes to serene delight  And from the bursting bubbles shade thy sight  Yet where thou shin'st like heav'n behind a cloud  Moving like light all piercing tho' not loud  The Muse shall find thee in thy blest retreat  And breathe this honest wish at Cobham's feet  Fresh as thy lakes may all thy pleasures flow  And breezy like thy groves thy passions blow  Wide as thy fancy be thy spreading praise  And long and lovely as thy walks thy days  An ODE ON THE DEATH of Mr PELHAM  By Mr GARRICK  An honest man's the noblest work of God  POPE  LET others hail the rising sun  I bow to that whose course is run  Which sets in endless night  Whose rays benignant bless'd this isle  Made peaceful Nature round us smile  With calm but cheerful light  No bounty past provokes my praise  No future prospects prompt my lays  From real grief they flow  I catch th' alarm from Britain's fears  My sorrows fall with Britain's tears  And join a nation's woe  Seeas you pass the crowded street  Despondence clouds each face you meet  All their lost friend deplore  You read in every pensive eye  You hear in ev'ry broken sigh  That Pelham is no more  If thus each Briton be alarm'd  Whom but his distant influence warm'd  What grief their breasts must rend  Who in his private virtues bless'd  By Nature's dearest tyes possess'd  The Husband Father Friend  What mute ye bardsno mournful verse  No chaplets to adorn his hearse  To crown the good and just  Your flowers in warmer regions bloom  You seek no pensions from the tomb  No laurels from the dust  When pow'r departed with his breath  The sons of Flatt'ry fled from death  Such insects swarm at noon  Not for herself my Muse is griev'd  She never ask'd nor e'er receiv'd  One ministerial boon  Hath some peculiar strange offence  Against us arm'd Omnipotence  To check the nation's pride  Behold th' appointed punishment  At length the vengeful bolt is sent  It fellwhen Pelham dy'd  Uncheck'd by shame unaw'd by dread  When Vice triumphant rears her head  Vengeance can sleep no more  The evil angel stalks at large  The good submits resigns his charge  And quits th' unhallow'd shore  The same sad morn  The th of March    was remarkable for the publication the works of a late Lord and the death of Mr Pelham  to church and state  So for our sins 'twas fix'd by fate  A double stroke was giv'n  Black as the whirlwinds of the north  St Jn's fell Genius issu'd forth  And Pelham fled to heav'n  By angels watch'd in Eden's bow'rs  Our parents pass'd their peaceful hours  Nor guilt nor pain they knew  But on the day which usher'd in  The hellborn train of mortal sin  The heav'nly guards withdrew  Look down much honour'd shade below  Still let thy pity aid our woe  Stretch out thy healing hand  Resume those feelings which on earth  Proclaim'd thy patriot love and worth  And sav'd a sinking land  Search with thy more than mortal eye  The breasts of all thy friends descry  What there has got possession  See if thy unsuspecting heart  In some for truth mistook not art  For principle profession  From these the pests of human kind  Whom royal bounty cannot bind  Protect our parent King  Unmask their treach'ry to his sight  Drag forth the vipers into light  And crush them ere they sting  If such his trust and honours share  Again exert thy guardian care  Each venom'd heart disclose  On Him on Him our all depends  Oh save him from his treach'rous friends  He cannot fear his foes  Whoe'er shall at the helm preside  Still let thy prudence be his guide  To stem the troubled wave  But chiefly whisper in his ear  "That GEORGE is open just sincere  "And dares to scorn a knave"  No selfish views t' oppress mankind  No mad ambition fir'd thy mind  To purchase fame with blood  Thy bosom glow'd with purer heat  Convinc'd that to be truly great  Is only to be good  To hear no lawless passion's call  To serve thy King yet feel for all  Such was thy glorious plan  Wisdom with gen'rous love took part  Together work thy head and heart  The Minister and Man  Unite ye kindred sons of worth  Strangle bold faction in its birth  Be Britain's weal your view  For this great end let all combine  Let virtue link each fair design  And Pelham live in you  VERSES Written at MOUNTAUBAN in FRANCE  By the Rev Mr JOSEPH WARTON  TARN how delightful wind thy willow'd waves  But ah they

 And still of daring deeds and dangers tell  I  Away enervate bards away  Who spin the courtly silken lay  Alluding to the French and Italian lyric poets  As wreaths for some vain Louis' head  Or

WARTON  MOTHER of musings Contemplation sage  Whose grotto stands upon the topmost rock  Of Teneriff 'mid the tempestuous night  On which in calmest meditation held  Thou hear'st with howling winds the beating rain  And drifting hail descend or if the skies  Unclouded shine and thro' the blue serene  Pale Cynthia rolls her silveraxled car  Whence gazing stedfast on the spangled vault  Raptur'd thou sit'st while murmurs indistinct  Of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear  With hoarse and hollow sounds secure selfblest  There oft thou listen'st to the wild uproar  Of fleets encount'ring that in whispers low  Ascends the rocky summit where thou dwell'st  Remote from man conversing with the spheres  O lead me queen sublime to solemn glooms  Congenial with my soul to cheerless shades  To ruin'd seats of twilight cells and bow'rs  Where thoughtful Melancholy loves to muse  Her fav'rite midnight haunts The laughing scenes  Of purple Spring where all the wanton train  Of Smiles and Graces seem to lead the dance  In sportive round while from their hands they show'r  Ambrosial blooms and flow'rs no longer charm  Tempe no more I court thy balmy breeze  Adieu green vales ye broider'd meads adieu  Beneath yon ruin'd abbey's mossgrown piles  Oft let me sit at twilight hour of eve  Where thro' some western window the pale moon  Pours her longlevell'd rule of streaming light  While sullen sacred silence reigns around  Save the lone screechowl's note who builds his bow'r  Amid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp  Or the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves  Of flaunting ivy that with mantle green  Invests some wasted tow'r Or let me tread  In neighb'ring walk of pines where mus'd of old  The cloyster'd brother thro' the gloomy void  That far extends beneath their ample arch  As on I pace religious horror wraps  My soul in dread repose But when the world  Is clad in Midnight's ravencolour'd robe  'Mid hollow charnels let me watch the flame  Of taper dim shedding a livid glare  O'er the wan heaps while airy voices talk  Along the glimm'ring walls or ghostly shape  At distance seen invites with beck'ning hand  My lonesome steps thro' the farwinding vaults  Nor undelightful is the solemn noon  Of night when haply wakeful from my couch  I start lo all is motionless around  Roars not the rushing wind the sons of men  And every beast in mute oblivion lie  All nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep  O then how fearful is it to reflect  That thro' the still globe's aweful solitude  No being wakes but me 'till stealing sleep  My drooping temples bathes in opiate dews  Nor then let dreams of wanton folly born  My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy  But let the sacred Genius of the night  Such mystic visions send as Spenser saw  When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze  To the fell house of Busyrane he led  Th' unshaken Britomart or Milton knew  When in abstracted thought he first conceiv'd  All heav'n in tumult and the Seraphim  Come tow'ring arm'd in adamant and gold  Let others love soft summer's ev'ning smiles  As list'ning to the distant waterfall  They mark the blushes of the streaky west  I choose the pale December's foggy glooms  Then when the sullen shades of ev'ning close  Where thro' the room a blindlyglimm'ring gleam  The dying embers scatter far remote  From Mirth's mad shouts that thro' th' illumin'd roof  Resound with festive echo let me sit  Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge  Then let my thought contemplative explore  This fleeting state of things the vain delights  The fruitless toils that still our search elude  As thro' the wilderness of life we rove  This sober hour of silence will unmask  False Folly's smiles that like the dazzling spells  Of wily Comus cheat th' unweeting eye  With blear illusion and persuade to drink  That charmed cup which Reason's mintage fair  Unmoulds and stamps the monster on the man  Eager we taste but in the luscious draught  Forget the pois'nous dregs that lurk beneath  Few know that elegance of soul refin'd  Whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy  From Melancholy's scenes than the dull pride  Of tasteless splendor and magnificence  Can e'er afford Thus Eloise whose mind  Had languish'd to the pangs of melting love  More genuine transport found as on some tomb  Reclin'd she watch'd the tapers of the dead  Or thro' the pillar'd iles amid pale shrines  Of imag'd saints and intermingled graves  Mus'd a veil'd votaress than Flavia feels  As thro' the mazes of the festive ball  Proud of her conquering charms and beauty's blaze  She floats amid the silken sons of dress  And shines the fairest of th' assembled fair  When azure noontide cheers the daedal globe  And the blest regent of the golden day  Rejoices in his bright meridian bow'r  How oft my wishes ask the night's return  That best befriends the melancholy mind  Hail sacred Night thou too shalt share my song  Sister of Ebonscepter'd Hecat hail  Whether in congregated clouds thou wrap'st  Thy viewless chariot or with silver crown  Thy beaming head encirclest ever hail  What tho' beneath thy gloom the forceresstrain  Far in obscured haunt of Laplandmoors  With rhymes uncouth the bloody cauldron bless  Tho' Murder wan beneath thy shrouding shade  Summons her slowey'd vot'ries to devise  Of secret slaughter while by one blue lamp  In hideous conf'rence sits the listening band  And start at each low wind or wakeful sound  What tho' thy stay the pilgrim curseth oft  As all benighted in Arabian wastes  He hears the wilderness around him howl  With roaming monsters while on his hoar head  The blackdescending tempest ceaseless beats  Yet more delightful to my pensive mind  Is thy return than bloomy morn's approach  Ev'n then in youthful prime of opening May  When from the portals of the saffron east  She sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews  Yet not ungrateful is the morn's approach  When dropping wet she comes and clad in clouds  While thro' the damp air scowls the louring south  Blackening the landscape's face that grove and hill  In formless vapours undistinguish'd swim  Th' afflicted songsters of the sadden'd groves  Hail not the sullen gloom the waving elms  That hoar thro' time and rang'd in thick array  Enclose with stately row some rural hall  Are mute nor echo with the clamors hoarse  Of rooks rejoicing on their airy boughs  While to the shed the dripping poultry crowd  A mournful train secure the villagehind  Hangs o'er the crackling blaze nor tempts the storm  Fix'd in th' unfinish'd furrow rests the plough  Rings not the high wood with enliv'ning shouts  Of early hunter all is silence drear  And deepest sadness wraps the face of things  Thro' POPE'S soft song tho' all the Graces breathe  And happiest art adorn his Attic page  Yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow  As at the root of mossy trunk reclin'd  In magic SPENSER'S wildlywarbled song  I see deserted Una wander wide  Thro' wasteful solitudes and lurid heaths  Weary forlorn than when the  Belinda See Rape of the Lock  fated fair  Upon the bosom bright of silver Thames  Launches in all the lustre of brocade  Amid the splendors of the laughing Sun  The gay description palls upon the sense  And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss  Ye Youths of Albion's beautyblooming isle  Whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love  Is there a pleasure like the pensive mood  Whose magic wont to sooth your soften'd souls  O tell how rapturous the joy to melt  To Melody's assuasive voice to bend  Th' uncertain step along the midnight mead  And pour your sorrows to the pitying moon  By many a slow trill from the bird of woe  Oft interrupted in embowering woods  By darksome brook to muse and there forget  The solemn dulness of the tedious world  While Fancy grasps the visionary fair  And now no more th' abstracted ear attends  The water's murm'ring lapse th' entranced eye  Pierces no longer thro' th' extended rows  Of thickrang'd trees 'till haply from the depth  The woodman's stroke or distanttinkling team  Or heifer rustling thro' the brake alarms  Th' illuded sense and mars the golden dream  These are delights that absence drear has made  Familiar to my soul e'er since the form  Of young Sapphira beauteous as the Spring  When from her vi'letwoven couch awak'd  By frolic Zephyr's hand her tender cheek  Graceful she lifts and blushing from her bow'r  Issues to cloath in gladsomeglist'ring green  The genial globe first met my dazzled sight  These are delights unknown to minds profane  And which alone the pensive soul can taste  The taper'd choir at the late hour of pray'r  Oft let me tread while to th' according voice  The manysounding organ peals on high  The clear slowdittyed chaunt or varied hymn  'Till all my soul is bath'd in ecstasies  And lap'd in Paradise Or let me sit  Far in sequester'd iles of the deep dome  There lonesome listen to the sacred sounds  Which as they lengthen thro' the Gothic vaults  In hollow murmurs reach my ravish'd ear  Nor when the lamps expiring yield to night  And solitude returns would I forsake  The solemn mansion but attentive hear  The due clock swinging slow with sweepy sway  Measuring Time's flight with momentary sound  Nor let me fail to cultivate my mind  With the soft thrillings of the tragic Muse  Divine Melpomene sweet Pity's nurse  Queen of the stately step and flowing pall  Now let Monimia mourn with streaming eyes  Her joys incestuous and polluted love  Now let soft Juliet in the gaping tomb  Print the last kiss on her true Romeo's lips  His lips yet reeking from the dreadly draught  Or Jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look  Nor seldom let the Moor of Desdemone  Pour the misguided threats of jealous rage  By soft degrees the manly torrent steals  From my swoln eyes and at a brother's woe  My big heart melts in sympathizing tears  What are the splendors of the gaudy court  Its tinsel trappings and its pageant pomps  To me far happier seems the banish'd Lord  Amid Siberia's unrejoycing wilds  Who pines all lonesome in the chambers hoar  Of some high castle shut whose windows dim  In distant ken discover trackless plains  Where Winter ever whirls his icy car  While stillrepeated objects of his view  The gloomy battlements and ivied spires  That crown the solitary dome arise  While from the topmost turret the slow clock  Far heard along th' inhospitable wastes  With sadreturning chime awakes new grief  Ev'n he far happier seems than is the proud  The potent Satrap whom he left behind  'Mid Moscow's golden palaces to drown  In ease and luxury the laughing hours  Illustrious objects strike the gazer's mind  With feeble bliss and but allure the sight  Nor rouze with impulse quick th' unfeeling heart  Thus seen by shepherd from Hymettus' brow  What daedal landscapes smile here balmy groves  Resounding once with Plato's voice arise  Amid whose umbrage green her silver head  Th' unfading olive lifts her vineclad hills  Lay forth their purple store and sunny vales  In prospect vast their level laps expand  Amid whose beauties glistering Athens tow'rs  Tho' thro' the blissful scenes Ilissus roll  His sageinspiring flood whose winding marge  The thickwove laurel shades tho' roseate Morn  Pour all her splendors on th' empurpled scene  Yet feels the hoary Hermit truer joys  As from the cliff that o'er his cavern hangs  He views the piles of fall'n Persepolis  In deep arrangement hide the darksome plain  Unbounded waste the mould'ring obelisc  Here like a blasted oak ascends the clouds  Here Parian domes their vaulted halls disclose  Horrid with thorn where lurks th' unpitying thief  Whence flits the twilightloving bat at eve  And the deaf adder wreathes her spotted train  The dwellings once of elegance and art  Here temples rise amid whose hallow'd bounds  Spires the black pine while thro' the naked street  Once haunt of tradeful merchants springs the grass  Here columns heap'd on prostrate columns torn  From their firm base increase the mould'ring mass  Far as the sight can pierce appear the spoils  Of sunk magnificence a blended scene  Of moles fanes arches domes and palaces  Where with his brother Horror Ruin sits  O come then Melancholy queen of thought  O come with saintly look and stedfast step  From forth thy cave embower'd with mournful yew  Where to the distant curfeu's solemn sound  List'ning thou sitt'st and with thy cypress bind  Thy votary's hair and seal him for thy son  But never let Euphrósyne beguile  With toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind  Nor in my path her primrosegarland cast  Tho' 'mid her train the dimpled Hebe bare  Her rosy bosom to th' enamour'd view  Tho' Venus mother of the Smiles and Loves  And Bacchus ivycrown'd in citronbow'r  With her on nectarstreaming fruitage feast  What tho' 'tis her's to calm the low'ring skies  And at her presence mild th' embattel'd clouds  Disperse in air and o'er

shady grove  Where fervent bees with humming voice  Around the honey'd oak rejoice  And aged elms with aweful bend  In long cathedral walks extend  Lull'd by the lapse of gliding floods  Cheer'd by the warbling of the woods  How blest my days my thoughts how free  In sweet society with thee  Then all was joyous all was young  And years unheeded roll'd along  But now the pleasing dream is o'er  These scenes must charm me now no more  Lost to the field and torn from you  Farewela long a last adieu  Me wrangling courts and stubborn Law  To smoak and crowds and cities draw  There selfish Faction rules the day  And Pride and Av'rice throng the way  Diseases taint the murky air  And midnight conflagrations glare  Loose Revelry and Riot bold  In frighted streets their orgies hold  Or when in silence all is drown'd  Fell Murder walks her lonely round  No room for peace no room for you  Adieu celestial Nymph adieu  Shakespear no more thy sylvan son  Nor all the art of Addison  Pope's heav'nstrung lyre nor Waller's ease  Nor Milton's mighty self must please  Instead of these a formal band  In furs and coifs around me stand  With sounds uncouth and accents dry  That grate the soul of harmony  Each pedant sage unlocks his store  Of mystic dark discordant lore  And points with tott'ring hand the ways  That lead me to the thorny maze  There in a winding close retreat  Is Justice doom'd to six her seat  There fenc'd by bulwarks of the Law  She keeps the wond'ring world in awe  And there from vulgar sight retir'd  Like eastern queens is more admir'd  O let me pierce the secret shade  Where dwells the venerable maid  There humbly mark with rev'rent awe  The guardian of Britannia's Law  Unfold with joy her sacred page  Th' united boast of many an age  Where mix'd yet uniform appears  The wisdom of a thousand years  In that pure spring the bottom view  Clear deep and regularly true  And other doctrines thence imbibe  Than lurk within the sordid scribe  Observe how parts with parts unite  In one harmonious rule of right  See countless wheels distinctly tend  By various laws to one great end  While mighty Alfred's piercing soul  Pervades and regulates the whole  Then welcome business welcome strife  Welcome the cares the thorns of life  The visage wan the poreblind sight  The toil by day the lamp at night  The tedious forms the solemn prate  The pert dispute the dull debate  The drowsy bench the babling Hall  For thee fair Justice welcome all  Thus tho' my noon of life be past  Yet let my setting sun at last  Find out the still the rural cell  Where sage Retirement loves to dwell  There let me taste the homefelt bliss  Of innocence and inward peace  Untainted by the guilty bribe  Uncurs'd amid the harpytribe  No orphan's cry to wound my ear  My honour and my conscience clear  Thus may I calmly meet my end  Thus to the grave in peace descend  By Miss COOPER now Mrs MADAN in he  Brother's Coke upon Littleton  O Thou who labour'st in this rugged mine  May'st thou to gold th' unpolish'd ore refine  May each dark page unfold its haggard brow  Doubt not to reap if thou canst bear to plough  To tempt thy care may each revolving night  Purses and maces swim before thy sight  From hence in times to come advent'rous deed  May'st thou essay to look and speak like Mead  When the black bag and rose no more shall shade  With martial air the honours of thy head  When the full wig thy visage shall enclose  And only leave to view they learned nose  Safely may'st thou defy beaux wits and scoffers  While tenants in fee simple stuff thy coffers  SOLITUDE An ODE  By Dr GRAINGER  I  O Solitude romantic Maid  Whether by nodding towers you tread  Or haunt the desart's trackless gloom  Or hover o'er the yawning tomb  Or climb the Andes' clifted side  Or by the Nile's coy source abide  Or starting from your halfyear's sleep  From Hecla view the thawing deep  Or Tadmor's marble wastes survey  Or in yon roofless cloyster stray  You Recluse again I woo  And again your steps pursue  II  Plum'd Conceit himself surveying  Folly with her shadow playing  Purseproud elbowing Insolence  Bloated empirick puff'd Pretence  Noise that thro' a trumpet speaks  Laughter in loud peals that breaks  Intrusion with a fopling's face  Ignorant of time and place  Sparks of fire Dissention blowing  Ductile courtbred Flattery bowing  Restraint's stiff neck Grimace's leer  Squintey'd Censure's artful sneer  Ambition's buskins steep'd in blood  Fly thy presence Solitude  III  Sage Reflection bent with years  Conscious Virtue void of fears  Muffled Silence woodnymph shy  Meditation's piercing eye  Halcyon Peace on moss reclin'd  Retrospect that scans the mind  Rapt earthgazing Resvery  Blushing artless Modesty  Health that snuffs the morning air  Fulley'd Truth with bosom bare  Inspiration Nature's child  Seek the solitary wild  IV  You with the tragic Muse  In the island Salamis  retir'd  The wise Euripides inspir'd  You taught the sadlypleasing air  That  See Plutarch in the life of Lysander  Athens sav'd from ruins bare  You gave the Cean's tears to flow  And  Simonides  unlock'd the springs of woe  You penn'd what exil'd Naso thought  And pour'd the melancholy note  With Petrarch o'er Valcluse you stray'd  When Death snatch'd his  Laura twenty years and ten after her death  longlov'd maid  You taught the rocks her loss to mourn  Ye strew'd with flowers her virgin urn  And late in  Monody on the death of Mrs Lyttelton  Hagley you were seen  With bloodshed eyes and sombre mien  Hymen his yellow vestment tore  And Dirge a wreath of cypress wore  But chief your own the solemn lay  That wept Narcissa young and gay  Darkness clap'd her sable wing  While you touch'd the mournful string  Anguish left the pathless wild  Grimfac'd Melancholy smil'd  Drowsy Midnight ceas'd to yawn  The starry host put back the dawn  Aside their harps ev'n Seraphs flung  To hear thy sweet complaint O Young  V  When all Nature's hush'd asleep  Nor Love nor Guilt their vigils keep  Soft you leave your cavern'd den  And wander o'er the works of men  But when Phosphor brings the dawn  By her dappled coursers drawn  Again you to the wild retreat  And the early huntsman meet  Where as you pensive pace along  You catch the distant shepherd's song  Or brush from herbs the pearly dew  Or the rising primrose view  Devotion lends her heavenplum'd wings  You mount and Nature with you sings  But when midday fervors glow  To upland airy shades you go  Where never sunburnt woodman came  Nor sportsman chas'd the timid game  And there beneath an oak reclin'd  With drowsy waterfalls behind  You sink to rest  'Till the tuneful bird of night  From the neighb'ring poplars height  Wake you with her solemn strain  And teach pleas'd Echo to complain  VI  With you roses brighter bloom  Sweeter every sweet perfume  Purer every fountain flows  Stronger every wilding grows  VII  Let those toil for gold who please  Or for fame renounce their ease  What is fame an empty bubble  Gold a transient shining trouble  Let them for their country bleed  What was Sidney's Raleigh's meed  Man's not worth a moment's pain  Base ungrateful fickle vain  Then let me sequester'd fair  To your Sibyl grot repair  On yon hanging cliff it stands  Scoop'd by Nature's salvage hands  Bosom'd in the gloomy shade  Of cypress not with age decay'd  Where the owl stillhooting sits  Where the bat incessant flits  There in loftier strains I'll sing  Whence the changing seasons spring  Tell how storms deform the skies  Whence the waves subside and rise  Trace the comet's blazing tail  Weigh the planets in a scale  Bend great God before thy shrine  The bournless macrocosm's thine  VIII  Save me what's yon shrouded shade  That wanders in the darkbrown glade  It beckons mevain fears adieu  Mysterious ghost I follow you  Ah me too well that gait I know  My youth's first f  riend my manhood's woe  Its breast it bares what stain'd with blood  Quick let me stanch the vital flood  Oh spirit whither art thou flown  Why left me comfortless alone  O Solitude on me bestow  The heartfelt harmony of woe  Such such as on th' Ausonian shore  Sweet  See Idyll  Dorian Moschus trill'd of yore  No time should cancel thy desert  More more than  Alluding to the death of a friend  Bion was thou wert  IX  O goddess of the tearful eye  The neverceasing stream supply  Let us with Retirement go  To charnels and the house of woe  O'er Friendship's herse lowdrooping mourn  Where the sickly tapers burn  Where Death and nunclad Sorrow dwell  And nightly ring the solemn knell  The gloom dispels the charnel smiles  Light flashes thro' the vaulted iles  Blow silky soft thou western gale  O goddess of the desert hail  She bursts from yon cliffriven cave  Insulted by the wintry wave  Her brow an ivy garland binds  Her tresses wanton with the winds  A lion's spoils without a zone  Around her limbs are careless thrown  Her right hand wields a knotted mace  Her eyes roll wild a stride her pace  Her left a magic mirror holds  In which she oft herself beholds  O goddess of the desert hail  And softer blow thou western gale  Since in each scheme of life I've fail'd  And disappointment seems entail'd  Since all on earth I valued most  My guide my stay my friend is lost  You only you can make me blest  And hush the tempest in my breast  Then gently deign to guide my feet  To your hermittrodden seat  Where I may live at last my own  Where I at last may die unknown  I spoke she twin'd her magic ray  And thus she said or seem'd to say  Youth you're mistaken if you think to find  In shades a medicine for a troubled mind  Wan Grief will haunt you wheresoe'er you go  Sigh in the breeze and in the streamlet flow  There pale Inaction pines his life away  And satiate curses the return of day  There naked Frenzy laughing wild with pain  Or bares the blade or plunges in the main  There Superstition broods o'er all her fears  And yells of daemons in the Zephyr hears  But if a hermit you're resolv'd to dwell  And bid to social life a last farewell  'Tis impious  God never made an independent man  'Twould jarr the concord of his general plan  See every part of that stupendous whole  "Whose body Nature is and God the soul"  To one great end the general good conspire  From matter brute to man to seraph fire  Should man thro' Nature solitary roam  His will his sovereign every where his home  What force wou'd guard him from the lion's jaw  What swiftness wing him from the panther's paw  Or should Fate lead him to some safer shore  Where panthers never prowl nor lions roar  Where liberal Nature all her charms bestows  Suns shine birds sing▪ flowers bloom and water flows  Fool dost thou think he'd revel on the store  Absolve the care of Heaven nor ask for more  Tho' waters flow'd flow'rs bloom'd and Phoebus shone  He'd sigh he'd murmur that he was alone  For know the Maker on the human breast  A sense of kindred country man imprest  And social life to better aid adorn  With proper faculties each mortal's born  Tho' Nature's works the ruling mind declare  And well deserve enquiry's serious care  The God whate'er Misanthrophy may say  Shines beams in man with most unclouded ray  What boots it thee to fly from pole to pole  Hang o'er the sun and with the planets roll  What boots thro' space's furthest bourns to roam  If thou O man a stranger art at home  Then know thyself the human mind survey  The use the pleasure will the toil repay  Hence Inspiration plans his manner'd lays  Hence Homer's crown and Shakespear hence thy bays  Hence he the pride of Athens and the shame  The best and wisest of mankind became  Nor study only practise what you know  Your life your knowledge to mankind you owe  With Plato's olive wreath the bays entwine  Those who in study shou'd in practice shine  Say does the learned Lord of Hagley's shade  Charm man so much by mossy fountains laid  As when arouz'd he stems Corruption's course  And shakes the senate with a Tully's force  When Freedom gasp'd beneath a Caesar's feet  Then publick Virtue might to shades retreat  But where she breathes the least may useful be  And Freedom Britain still belong to thee  Tho' man's ungrateful or tho' Fortune frown  Is the reward of worth a song or crown  Nor yet unrecompens'd are Virtue's pains  Good Allen lives and bounteous Brunswick reigns  On each condition disappointments wait  Enter the hut and force the guarded gate  Nor dare repine tho' early Friendship bleed  From love the world and all its cares he's freed  But know Adversity's the child of God  Whom Heaven approves of most most feel her rod  When smooth old Ocean and each storm's asleep  Then Ignorance may plough the watery deep  But when the daemons of the tempest rave  Skill must conduct the vessel thro' the wave  Sidney what good man envies not thy blow  Who wou'd not wish  One of the accusers of Socrates  Anytus for a foe  Intrepid Virtue triumphs over Fate  The good can never be unfortunate  And be this maxim graven in thy mind  The height of virtue is to serve mankind  But when old age has silver'd o'er thy head  When memory fails and all thy vigour's fled  Then may'st thou seek the stillness of retreat  Then hear aloof the human tempest beat  Then will I greet thee to my woodland cave  Allay the pangs of age and smooth thy grave  An ODE To the Right Honourable STEPHEN POYNTZ  Esq  c c  By the Honourable Sir CHARLES HAN WILLIAMS Kt of the Bath  Sensere quid mens rite quid indoles  Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus  Posset  Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam  Rectique cultus pectora roborant  HOR Od Lib  I  WHILST William's deeds and William's praise  Each English breast with transport raise  Each English tongue employ  Say Poyntz if thy elated heart  Assumes not a superior part  A larger share of joy  II  But that thy country's high affairs  Employ thy time demand thy cares  You shou'd renew your flight  You only shou'd this theme pursue  Wno can for William feel like you  Or who like you can write  III  Then to rehearse the Hero's praise  To paint this sunshine of his days  The pleasing task be mine  To think on all thy cares o'erpaid  To view the Hero you have made  That pleasing part be thine  IV  Who first should watch and who call forth  This youthful Prince's various worth  You had the publick voice  Wisely his royal Sire consign'd  To you the culture of his mind  And England blest the choice  V  You taught him to be early known  By martial deeds of courage shewn  From this near Mona's flood  By his victorious Father led  He flesh'd his maiden sword he shed  And prov'd th' illustrious blood  VI  Of Virtue's various charms you taught  With happiness and glory fraught  How her unshaken pow'r  Is independent of success  That no defeat can make it less  No conquest make it more  VII  This after Tournay's fatal day  'Midst sorrow cares and dire dismay  Brought calm and sure relief  He scrutiniz'd his noble heart  Found Virtue had perform'd her part  And peaceful slept the Chief  VIII  From thee he early learnt to feel  The Patriot's warmth for England's weal  True Valour's noblest spring  To vindicate her Church distrest  To

Consenting bend to ev'ry pray'r  And all thy wishes crown  X  We saw a wretch with trait'rous aid  Our King's and Church's rights invade  And thine fair Liberty  We saw thy Hero fly to war  Beat down Rebellion break her spear  And set the nation free  XI  Culloden's field my glorious theme  My rapture vision and my dream  Gilds the young Hero's days  Yet can there be one English heart  That does not give thee Poyntz thy part  And own thy share of praise  XII  Nor is thy fame to thee decreed  For life's short date when William's head  For victories to come  The frequent laurel shall receive  Chaplets for thee our sons shall weave  And hang 'em on thy tomb  ODE on the Death of MATZEL a favourite Bullfinch address'd to Mr STPE to whom the Author had given the Reversion of it when he left Dresden  By the Same  I  TRY not my Stpe 'tis in vain  To stop your tears to hide your pain  Or check your honest rage  Give sorrow and revenge their scope  My present joy your future hope  Lies murder'd in his cage  II  Matzel's no more ye graces loves  Ye linnets nightingales and doves  Attend th' untimely bier  Let ev'ry sorrow be exprest  Beat with your wings each mournful breast  And drop the nat'ral tear  III  In height of song in beauty's pride  By fell Grimalkin's claws he died  But vengeance shall have way  On pains and tortures I'll refine  Yet Matzel that one death of thine  His nine will ill repay  IV  For thee my bird the sacred Nine  Who lov'd thy tuneful notes shall join  In thy funereal verse  My painful task shall be to write  Th' eternal dirge which they indite  And hang it on thy hearse  V  In vain I lov'd in vain I mourn  My bird who never to return  Is fled to happier shades  Where Lesbia shall for him prepare  The place most charming and most fair  Of all th' Elysian glades  VI  There shall thy notes in cypress grove  Sooth wretched ghosts that died for love  There shall thy plaintive strain  Lull impious Phaedra's endless grief  To Procris yield some short relief  And soften Dido's pain  VII  'Till Proserpine by chance shall hear  Thy notes and make thee all her care  And love thee with my love  While each attendant's soul shall praise  The matchless Matzel's tuneful lays  And all his songs approve  MARTIALIS EPIGRAMMA Lib vi Ep Imitated  By the Same  COME Chloe and give me sweet kisses  For sweeter sure never girl gave  But why in the midst of my blisses  Do you ask me how many I'd have  I'm not to be stinted in pleasure  Then pr'ythee my charmer be kind  For whilst I love thee above measure  To numbers I'll ne'er be confin'd  Count the bees that on Hybla are playing  Count the flow'rs that enamel its fields  Count the flocks that on Tempe are straying  Or the grain that rich Sicily yields  Go number the stars in the heaven  Count how many sands on the shore  When so many kisses you've given  I still shall be craving for more  To a heart full of love let me hold thee  To a heart which dear Chloe is thine  With my arms I'll for ever enfold thee  And twist round thy limbs like a vine  What joy can be greater than this is  My life on thy lips shall be spent  But the wretch that can number his kisses  With few will be ever content  The Progress of DISCONTENT A POEM Written at Oxford in the Year  WHEN now mature in classic knowledge  The joyful youth is sent to college  His father comes a vicar plain  At Oxford bredin Anna's reign  And thus in form of humble suitor  Bowing accosts a reverend tutor  "Sir I'm a Glo'stershire divine  "And this my eldest son of nine  "My wife's ambition and my own  "Was that this child should wear a gown  "I'll warrant that his good behaviour  "Will justify your future favour  "And for his parts to tell the truth  "My son's a very forward youth  "Has Horace all by heartyou'd wonder  "And mouths out Homer's Greek like thunder  "If you'd examineand admit him  "A scholarship would nicely fit him  "That he succeeds 'tis ten to one  "Your vote and interest Sir'Tis done"  Our pupil's hopes tho' twice defeated  Are with a scholarship compleated  A scholarship but half maintains  And college rules are heavy chains  In garret dark he smokes and puns  A prey to discipline and duns  And now intent on new designs  Sighs for a fellowshipand fines  When nine full tedious winters past  That utmost wish is crown'd at last  But the rich prize no sooner got  Again he quarrels with his lot  "These fellowships are pretty things  "We live indeed like petty kings  "But who can bear to waste his whole age  "Amid the dullness of a college  "Debarr'd the common joys of life  "And that prime blissa loving wife  "O what's a table richly spread  "Without a woman at its head  "Would some snug benefice but fall  "Ye feasts ye dinners farewel all  "To offices I'd bid adieu  "Of dean vice praesof bur  "Come joys that rural quiet yields  "Come tythes and house and fruitful fields"  Too fond of liberty and ease  A patriot's vanity to please  Long time he watches and by stealth  Each frail incumbent's doubtful health  At lengthand in his fortieth year  A living dropstwo hundred clear  With breast elate beyond expression  He hurries down to take possession  With rapture views the sweet retreat  "What a convenient house how neat  "For fuel here's sufficient wood  "Pray God the cellars may be good  "The gardenthat must be new plann'd  "Shall these oldfashion'd yewtrees stand  "O'er yonder vacant plot shall rise  "The flow'ry shrub of thousand dies  "Yon' wall that feels the southern ray  "Shall blush with ruddy fruitage gay  "While thick beneath its aspect

"Up yon' green slope of hazels trim  "An avenue so cool and dim  "Shall to an arbour at the end  "In spite of gout intice a friend  "My predecessor lov'd devotion  "But of a garden had no notion"  Continuing this fantastic farce on  He now commences country parson  To make his character entire  He wedsa cousin of the 'squire  Not overweighty in the purse  But many doctors have done worse  And tho' she boast no charms divine  Yet she can carve and make birch wine  Thus fixt content he taps his barrel  Exhorts his neighbours not to quarrel  Finds his churchwardens have discerning  Both in good liquor and good learning  With tythes his barns replete he sees  And chuckles o'er his surplice sees  Studies to find out latent dues  And regulates the state of pews  Rides a sleek mare with purple housing  To share the monthly club's carousing  Of Oxford pranks facetious tells  Andbut on Sundayshears no bells  Sends presents of his choicest fruit  And prunes himself each sapless shoot  Plants colliflow'rs and boasts to rear  The earliest melons of the year  Thinks alteration charming work is  Keeps Bantam cocks and feeds his turkies  Builds in his copse a favourite bench  And stores the pond with carp and tench  But ah too soon his thoughtless breast  By cares domestic is opprest  And a third butcher's bill and brewing  Threaten inevitable ruin  For children fresh expences yet  And Dicky now for school is fit  "Why did I sell my college life  "He cries for benefice and wife  "Return ye days when endless pleasure  "I found in reading or in leisure  "When calm around the

scarce enjoy'd  Each prize possess'd thy transport ceases  And in pursuit alone it pleases  The FIRESIDE  By Dr COTTON  I  DEAR Chloe while the busy crowd  The vain the wealthy and the proud  In Folly's maze advance  Tho' singularity and pride  Be call'd our choice we'll step aside  Nor join the giddy dance  II  From the gay world we'll oft retire  To our own family and fire  Where love our hours employs  No noisy neighbour enters here  No intermeddling stranger near  To spoil our heartfelt joys  III  If solid happiness we prize  Within our breast this jewel lies  And they are fools who roam  The world has nothing to bestow  From our own selves our joys must flow  And that dear hut our home  IV  Of rest was Noah's dove bereft  When with impatient wing she left  That safe retreat the ark  Giving her vain excursion o'er  The disappointed bird once more  Explor'd the sacred bark  V  Tho' fools spurn Hymen's gentle pow'rs  We who improve his golden hours  By sweet experience know  That marriage rightly understood  Gives to the tender and the good  A paradise below  VI  Our babes shall richest comforts bring  If tutor'd right they'll prove a spring  Whence pleasures ever rise  We'll form their minds with studious care  To all that's manly good and fair  And train them for the skies  VII  While they our wisest hours engage  They'll joy our youth support our age  And crown our hoary hairs  They'll grow in virtue ev'ry day  And thus our fondest loves repay  And recompense our cares  VIII  No borrow'd joys they're all our own  While to the world we live unknown  Or by the world forgot  Monarchs we envy not your state  We look with pity on the great  And bless our humbler lot  IX  Our portion is not large indeed  But then how little do we need  For Nature's calls are few  In this the art of living lies  To want no more than may suffice  And make that little do  X  We'll therefore relish with content  Whate'er kind Providence has sent  Nor aim beyond our pow'r  For if our stock be very small  'Tis prudence to enjoy it all  Nor lose the present hour  XI  To be resign'd when ills betide  Patient when favours are deny'd  And pleas'd with favours giv'n  Dear Chloe this is wisdom's part  This is that incense of the heart  Whose fragrance smells to heav'n  XII  We'll ask no long protracted treat  Since winter life is seldom sweet  But when our feast is o'er  Grateful from table we'll arise  Nor grudge our sons with envious eyes  The relicks of our store  XIII  Thus hand in hand thro' life we'll go  Its checker'd paths of joy and woe  With cautious steps we'll tread  Quit its vain scenes without a tear  Without a trouble or a fear  And mingle with the dead  XIV  While Conscience like a faithful friend  Shall thro' the gloomy vale attend  And cheer our dying breath  Shall when all other comforts cease  Like a kind angel whisper peace  And smooth the bed of death  TOMORROW  By the Same  Pereunt et Imputantur  TOmorrow didst thou say  Methought I

worshipful company Poets and Newswriters SHEWETH  THAT your honour's petitioners dealers in rhyme  And writers of scandal for mending the times  By losses in bus'ness and England's welldoing  Are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin  That these their misfortunes they humbly conceive  Arise not from dulness as some folks believe  But from rubs in their way that your honour has laid  And want of materials to carry on trade  That they always had form'd high conceits of their use  And meant their last breath should go out in abuse  But now and they speak it with sorrow and tears  Since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs  No party will join 'em no faction invite  To heed what they say or to read what they write  Sedition and Tumult and Discord are fled  And Slander scarce ventures to lift up her head  In short publick bus'ness is so carry'd on  That their country is sav'd and the patriots undone  To perplex 'em still more and sure famine to bring  Now satire has lost both its truth and its sting  If in spite of their natures they bungle at praise  Your honour regards not and nobody pays  YOUR Petitioners therefore most humbly entreat  As times will allow and your honour thinks meet  That measures be chang'd and some cause of complaint  Be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint  Their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve  That again they may rail and the nation believe  Or else if your wisdom shall deem it all one  Now the parliament's rising and bus'ness is done  That your honour would please at this dangerous crisis  To take to your bosom a few private vices  By which your petitioners haply might thrive  And keep both themselves and contention alive  In compassion good Sir give 'em something to say  And your honour's petitioners ever

Gallum  Aonas in montes ut duxerit una sororum  Utque viro Phoebi chorus assurrexerit omnis  VIRGIL  By Mr MASON Fellow of PembrokeHall  Set to Musick by Mr BOYCE Composer to his Majesty  Recitative  HERE all thy active fires diffuse  Thou genuine British Muse  Hither descend from yonder orient sky  Cloth'd in thy heav'nwove robe of harmony  Air  I  Come imperial queen of song  Come with all that freeborn grace  Which lifts thee from the servile throng  Who meanly mimic thy majestic pace  That glance of dignity divine  Which speaks thee of celestial line  Proclaims thee inmate of the sky  Daughter of Jove and Liberty  II  Recitative  The elevated soul who feels  Thy aweful impulse walks the fragrant ways  Of honest unpolluted praise  He with impartial justice deals  The blooming chaplets of immortal lays  He flies above ambition's low career  And nobly thron'd in Truth's meridian sphere  Thence with a bold and heav'ndirected aim  Full on fair Virtue's shrine he pours the rays of fame  III  Air  II  Goddess thy piercing eye explores  The radiant range of Beauty's stores  The steep ascent of pineclad hills  The silver slope of falling rills  Catches each livelycolour'd grace  The crimson of the woodnymph's face  The verdure of the velvet lawn  The purple in the eastern dawn  Or all those tints which rang'd in vivid glow  Mark the bold sweep of the celestial bow  IV  Recitative  But chief she lifts her tuneful transports high  When to her intellectual eye  The mental beauties rise in moral dignity  The sacred zeal for Freedom's cause  That fires the glowing Patriot's breast  The honest pride that plumes the Hero's crest  When for his country's aid the steel he draws  Or that the calm yet active heat  With which mild Genius warms the Sage's heart  To lift fair Science to a loftier seat  Or stretch to ampler bounds the wide domain of art  Air  III  These the best blossoms of the virtuous mind  She culls with taste refin'd  From their ambrosial bloom  With beelike skill she draws the rich perfume  And blends the sweets they all convey  In the soft balm of her mellifluous lay  V  Recitative  Is there a clime where all these beauties rise  In one collected radiance to her eyes  Is there a plain whose genial soil enhales  Glory's invigorating gales  Her brightest beams where Emulation spreads  Her kindliest dews where Science sheds  Where every stream of Genius flows  Where ev'ry flower of Virtue glows  Thither the Muse exulting flies  There she loudly cries  Chorus  I  All hail all hail  Majestic Granta hail thy aweful name  Dear to the Muse to Liberty to Fame  VI  Recitative  You too illustrious Train she greets  Who first in these inspiring seats  Caught the bright beams of that aetherial fire  Which now sublimely prompts you to aspire  To deeds of noblest note whether to shield  Your country's liberties your country's laws  Or in Religion's hallow'd cause  To hurl the shafts of reason and to wield  Those heav'nlytemper'd arms whose rapid force  Arrests base Falshood in her impious course  And drives rebellious Vice indignant from the field  VII  Air  IV  And now she tunes her plausive song  To you her sage domestic throng  Who here at Learning's richest shrine  Dispense to each ingenuous youth  The treasures of immortal Truth  And open Wisdom's golden mine  Recitative  Each youth inspir'd by your persuasive art  Clasps the dear form of virtue to his heart  And feels in his transported soul  Enthusiastic raptures roll  Gen'rous as those the sons of Cecrops caught  In hoar Lycaeum's shades from Plato's fireclad thought  Air  V  O Granta on thy happy plain  Still may these Attic glories reign  Still mayst thou keep thy wonted state  In unaffected grandeur great  Recitative  Great as this illustrious hour  When He whom GEORGE'S wellweigh'd choice  And Albion's general voice  Have lifted to the fairest heights of pow'r  When He appears and deigns to shine  The leader of thy learned line  And bids the verdure of thy olive bough  'Mid all his civic chaplets twine  And add fresh glories to his honour'd brow  IX  Air  VI  Haste then and amply o'er his head  The graceful foliage spread  Mean while the Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame  And lift her swelling accents high  To tell the world that PELHAM'S name  Is dear to Learning as to Liberty  Full Chorus  The Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame  And lift her swelling accents high  To tell the world that PELHAM'S name  Is dear to Learning as to Liberty  ODE to an AEOLUS's  This instrument appears to have been invented by  KIR∣CHER  who has

vita  MARTIAL  By Mr DUNCOMBE Fellow of Corpus Christi College▪ CAMBRIDGE  I  HEALTH to thee thy vot'ry owes  All the blessings life bestows  All the sweets the summer yields  Melodious woods and clover'd fields  By thee he tastes the calm delights  Of studious days and peaceful nights  By thee his eye each scene with rapture views  The Muse shall sing thy gifts for they inspire the Muse  II  Does increase of wealth impart  Transports to a bounteous heart  Does the sire with smiles survey  His prattling children round him play  Does love with mutual blushes streak  The swain's and virgin's artless cheek  From HEALTH these blushes smiles and transports flow  Wealth children love itself to HEALTH their relish owe  III  Nymph with thee at early Morn  Let me brush the waving corn  And at Noontide's sultry hour  O bear me to the woodbine bow'r  When Evening lights her glowworm lead  To yonder dewenamell'd mead  And let me range at Night those glimm'ring groves  Where stillness ever sleeps and Contemplation roves  IV  This my tributary lay  Grateful at thy shrine I pay  Who for sev'n whole years hast shed  Thy balmy blessings o'er my head  O let me still enamour'd view  Those fragrant lips of rosy hue  Nor think there needs th' allay of sharp disease  To quicken thy repast and give it pow'r to please  V  Now by swiftest Zephyrs drawn  Urge thy chariot o'er the lawn  In yon gloomy grotto laid  Author of Clarissa  PALEMON asks thy kindly aid  If goodness can that aid engage  O hover round the virtuous sage  Nor let one sigh for his own suff'rings rise  Each human suff'ring fills his sympathizing eyes  VI  Venus from Aeneas' side  With successful efforts try'd  To extract th' envenom'd dart  That baffled wise Iapis' art  If thus HYGEIA thou couldst prove  Propitious to the queen of love  Now on thy favour'd HEBERDEN bestow  Thy choicest healing pow'rs for Pallas asks them now  VII  What tho' banish'd from the fight  To the hero's troubled sight  Ranks

foliage every bower  With verdure every mead  Bid all thy vernal breezes fly  Diffusing mildness thro' the sky  Give the soft season to our drooping plains  Sprinkled with rosy dews and salutary rains  II  Enough has Winter's hand severe  Hurl'd all his terrors round  Chill'd the fair dawning of the year  And whiten'd all the ground  Give but thy vital beams to play  The frozen scenes will melt away  And mix in sprightly dance the blooming Hours  Will 'wake the drowsy Spring and Spring awake the flowers  Let Health gay daughter of the skies  On Zephyr's wings descend  And scatter pleasures as she flies  Where Surry's downs extend  There HERRING wooes her friendly power  There may she all her roses shower  To heal that shepherd all her balms employ  So will she sooth our fears and give a nation joy  IV  Ah me that Virtue's godlike friends  So soon are claim'd by Fate  Lo  The Right Honourable Henry Pelham  Esq  died on the th of March    PELHAM to the grave descends  The bulwark of the state  When will fair Truth his equal find  Among the best of human kind  Long be the fatal day with mourning kept  AUGUSTUS sigh'd sincere and all the worthy wept  V  Thy delegate kind heaven restore  To health and safely keep  Let good AUGUSTUS sigh no more  No more the worthy weep  And still upon the royal head  The riches of thy blessings shed  Establish'd with his counsellors around  Long be his prosp'rous reign and all with glory crown'd  An AUTUMNAL ODE  By the Same  I  YET once more glorious God of day  While beams thine orb serene  O let me warbling court thy stay  To gild the fading scene  Thy rays invigorate the Spring  Bright Summer to perfection bring  The cold inclement days of Winter cheer  And make th' Autumnal months the mildest of the year  II  Ere yet the russet foliage fall  I'll climb the mountain's brow  My friend my Hayman at thy call  To view the scene below  How sweetly pleasing to behold  Forests of vegetable gold  How mix'd the manychequer'd shades between  The tawny mellowing hue and the gay vivid green  III  How splendid all the sky how still  How mild the dying gale  How soft the whispers of the rill  That winds along the dale  So tranquil Nature's works appear  It seems the Sabbath of the year  As if the Summer's Labour past she chose  This season's sober calm for blandishing repose  IV  Such is of wellspent life the time  When busy days are past  Man verging gradual from his prime  Meets sacred Peace at last  His flowery Spring of pleasures o'er  And Summer's fullblown pride no more  He gains pacific Autumn meek and bland  And dauntless braves the stroke of Winter's palsy'd hand  V  For yet awhile a little while  Involv'd in wint'ry gloom  And lo another Spring shall smile  A Spring eternal bloom  Then shall he shine a glorious guest  In the bright mansions of the blest  Where due rewards on Virtue are bestow'd  And reap the golden fruits of what his Autumn sow'd  A SONG  I  AWAY let nought to love displeasing  My Winifreda move thy fear  Let nought delay the heav'nly blessing  Nor squeamish pride nor gloomy care  II  What tho' no grants of royal donors  With pompous titles grace our blood  We'll shine in more substantial honours  And to be noble we'll be good  III  What tho' from Fortune's lavish bounty  No mighty treasures we possess  We'll find within our pittance plenty  And be content without excess  IV  Still shall each kind returning season  Sufficient for our wishes give  For we will live a life of reason  And that's the only life to live  V  Our name whilst virtue thus we tender  Shall sweetly sound where'er 'tis spoke  And all the great ones much shall wonder  How they admire such little folk  VI  Thro' youth and age in love excelling  We'll hand in hand together tread  Sweet smiling Peace shall crown our dwelling  And babes sweet smiling babes our bed  VII  How should I love the pretty creatures  Whilst round my knees they fondly clung  To see 'em look their mother's features  To hear 'em lisp their mother's tongue  VIII  And when with envy Time transported  Shall think to rob us of our joys  You'll in your girls again be courted  And I go wooing in my boys  The GENIUS An ODE written in on occasion of the Duke of MARLBOROUGH'S Apoplexy  I  AWEFUL here Marlb'rough rise  Sleepy charms I come to break  Higher turn thy languid eyes  Lo thy Genius calls awake  II  Well survey this faithful plan  With records thy life's great story  'Tis a short but crowded span  Full of triumphs full of glory  III  One by one thy deeds review  Sieges battles thick appear  Former wonders lost in new  Greatly fill each pompous year  IV  This is Blenheim's crimson field  Wet with gore with slaughter stain'd  Here retiring squadrons yield  And a bloodless wreath is gain'd  V  Ponder in thy godlike mind  All the wonders thou hast wrought  Tyrants from their pride declin'd  Be the subject of thy thought  VI  Rest thee here while life may last  Th' utmost bliss to man allow'd  Is to trace his actions past  And to own them great and good  VII  But 'tis gonea mortal born  Swift the fading scenes remove  Let them pass with noble scorn  Thine are worlds which roll above  VIII  Poets prophets heroes kings  Pleas'd thy ripe approach foresee  Men who acted wond'rdus things  Tho' they yield in same to thee  IX  Foremost in the patriotband  Shining with distinguish'd day  See thy friend Godolphin stand  See he beckons thee away  X  Yonder seats and fields of light  Let thy ravish'd thought explore  Wishing panting for thy flight  Half an angel man no more  TRANSLATIONS from HORACE  By Mr MARRIOTT of TrinityHall Cambridge  Book I Ode XVIII Invitation to his Mistress  OFT Faunus leaves Arcadia's plain  And to the Sabine hill retreats  He guards my flocks from rushing rain  From piercing winds and scorching heats  Where lurks the thyme or shrubs appear  My wanton kids securely play  My goats no pois'nous serpent fear  Safe wand'ring thro' the woodland way  No hostile wolf the fold invades  Ustica's pendent rocks rebound  My song and all the sylvan shades  By Echo taught return the sound  The gods my verse propitious hear  My head from every danger shield  For you o'erflows the bounteous year  And Plenty's horn hath heap'd my field  Responsive to the Teian string  Within the sundefended vale  Here softly warbling you shall sing  Each tender tuneful am'rous tale  No rival here shall burst the bands  That wreathe my charmer's beauteous hair  Nor seize her weakly struggling hands  But Love and Horace guard the fair  Ode VI Book II Imitated  BEVIL that with your friend would roam  Far from your England's happier home  Should e'er the Fates that friend detain  In gayer France or graver Spain  Know all my wish is to retreat  When age shall quench my youthful heat  In Kentish shades sweet peace to find  And leave the sons of care behind  But should this pleasing hope be vain  May I fair Windsor's seat attain  Where Leddon's gentle waters glide  And flocks adorn its flowery side  Sweet groves I love your silent shades  Your russet lawns and op'ning glades  With fam'd Italia's plains may vie  Your fertile fields and healthful sky  Here let our eve of life be spent  Here friend shall live with friend content  Here in cold earth my limbs be laid  And here thy generous tear be paid  Book II Ode XII Translated  THE wars of Numantia and Hannibal dire  On land or on ocean the fighting  Maecenas ne'er suited my peaceable lyre  In subjects much softer delighting  You love not of centaurs embattled to hear  Nor of giants a tale of such wonder  Who shook all the skies made Jupiter fear  'Till drove by Alcides and thunder  In prose my good patron more nobly you write  As your topic than these is much better  How Caesar with glory can govern and fight  And lead haughty kings in his fetter  Alone my gay Muse of Licinnia would sing  The constant goodnatur'd and pretty  So graceful to dance with the maids in a ring  So sparkling so merry and witty  While you play with her hair that is carelessly curl'd  While this way now that way she twitches  Of your teazing so kindly complaining no world  Could bribe for one lock with its riches  Thus blest with the nymph how transporting the joy  Who whimsical wanton amuses  Who pleasingly forward or prettily coy  Oft snatches the kiss she refuses  To a LADY making a PinBasket  By the same  WHILE objects of a parent's care  With joy your fond attention share  Madam accept th' auspicious strain  Nor rise your beauteous work in vain  Oft be your second race survey'd  And oft a new pinbasket made  When marriage was in all its glory  So poets madam tell the story  Ere Plutus damp'd love's purer flame  Or Smithfield bargains had a name  In heav'n a blooming youth and bride  At Hymen's altars were ally'd  When Cupid had his Psyché won  And all her destin'd labours done  The cruel Fates their rage relented  And mamma Venus had consented  At Jove's command and Hermes' call  The train appear'd to fill the hall  And gods and goddesses were drest  To do them honour in their best  The little rogues now pass'd the row  And look'd and mov'd I don't know how  And ambling hand in hand appear  Before the mighty thunderer  Low at his throne they bent the knee  He smil'd the blushing pair to see  Lay'd his tremendous bolt aside  And strok'd their cheeks and kiss'd the bride  Says Juno since our Jove's so kind  My dears some present I must find  In greatest pleasures greatest dangers  We and the sex were never strangers  With bounteous hand my gifts I spread  Presiding o'er the marriagebed  Soon for the months are on the wing  To you a daughter fair I bring  And know from this your nuptial morn  Shall Pleasure smiling babe be born  But for the babe we must prepare  That too shall be your Juno's care  Apollo from his golden lyre  Shall first assist us with the wire  Vulcan shall make the silver pin  The basket thus we shall begin  Where we may put the child's array  And get it ready by the day  The nymphs themselves with flowers shall dress it  Pallas shall weave and I will bless it  Captain CUPID  By the Same  ERST in Cythera's sacred shade  When Venus clasp'd the god of war  The laughing loves around them play'd  One bore the shield and one the spear  The little warriors Cupid led  The shining baldric grac'd his breast  The mighty helmet o'er his head  Nodded its formidable crest  Hence oft' to win some stubborn maid  Still does the wanton God assume  The martial air the gay cockade  The sword the shoulderknot and plume  Phyllis had long his power defy'd  Resolv'd her conquests to maintain  His fruitless art each poet try'd  Each shepherd tun'd his pipe in vain  'Till Cupid came a captain bold  Of trenches and of palisadoes  He talk'd and many a tale he told  Of battles and of ambuscadoes  How oft' his godship had been drunk  What melting maids he had undone  How oft' by night had storm'd a punk  Or bravely beat a saucy dun  He swore drank whor'd sung danc'd with spirit  And o'er each pleasing topic ran  'Till Phyllis sigh'd and own'd his merit  The Captain's sure a charming man  Ye bards on verse let Phoebus doat  Ye shepherds leave your pipes to Pan  Nor verse nor pipe will Phyllis note  The Captain is the charming man  ODE on Ambition  By the Same  THE mariner when first he sails  While his bold oars the sparkling surface sweep  With new delight transported hails  The blue expanded skies and level deep  Such young Ambition's fearless aim  Pleas'd with the gorgeous scene of wealth and power  In the gay morn of early fame  Nor thinks of evening storm and gloomy hour  Life's opening views bright charms reveal  Feed the fond wish and fan the youthful fire  But woes unknown those charms conceal  And fair illusions cheat our fierce desire  There Envy shows her sullen mien  With changeful colour grinning smiles of hate  There Malice stabs with rage serene  In deadly silence treacherous Friendships wait  High on a mountain's lofty brow  'Mid clouds and storms has Glory fix'd her seat  Rock'd by the roaring winds that blow  The lightnings blast it and the tempests beat  Within the sungilt vale beneath  More moderate Hope with sweet Contentment dwells  While gentler breezes round them breathe  And softer showers refresh their peaceful cells  To better genius ever blind  That points to each in varied life his share  Man quits the path by heaven design'd  To search for bliss among the thorns of care  Our native powers we scorn to know  With stedfast error still the wrong pursue  Instruct our forward ills to grow  While sad successes but our pain renew  In vain heaven tempers life with sweet  With flowers the way that leads us home bestrews  If dupes to passion and deceit  We drink the bitter and the rugged chuse  Few can on Grandeur's stage appear  Each lofty part with true applause sustain  No common virtue safe can steer  Where rocks unnumber'd lurk beneath the main  Then happiest he whose timely hand  To cool Discretion has the helm resign'd  Enjoys the calm in sight of land  From changing tides secure and trustless wind  ODE to FANCY  By the Same  I  GILDING with brighter beams the vernal skies  Now hastes the car of day to rise  Youth and Mirth and Beauty leads  In golden reins the sprightly steeds  With wanton Love that rolls his sparkling eyes  Morpheus no more  Thy poppies cropt on Lethe's margin shed  Around thy languid poet's head  Thou drowsy god  'Tis time to break thy leaden rod  And give thy slumbers o'er  But come thou woodland Nymph along  Mistress of the vocal song  Fancy ever fair and free  Whether on the mountains straying  Or on beds of roses playing  Daughter of sweet Liberty  II  Through all the ivycircled cave  Soft music at thy birth was heard to sound  The graces danc'd thy bower around  And gently dipt thee in the silver wave  With blossoms fair thy cradle drest  And rock'd their smiling babe to rest  To kiss thy lips the bees a murmuring throng  With busy wings unnumber'd flew  For thee from every flower their tribute drew  And lull'd thy slumbers with an airy song  Come in thy heav'nly woven vest  That Iris' hand has ting'd in every dye  With which she paints the sky  Flowing o'er thv zoneless breast  III  Me sweet enchantress deign to bear  O'er the seas and thro' the air  O'er the plains extended wide  O'er misty hills and curling clouds we ride  Now mounting high now sinking low  Thro' hail and rain and vapours go  Where is treasur'd up the snow  Where sleeps the thunder in its cell  Where the swiftwing'd light'nings dwell  Or where the blust'ring storms are taught to blow  Now tread the milky way  Unnumber'd worlds that float in aether spy  Among the glittering planets stray  To the lunar orbit fly  And mountains shores and seas descry  Now catch the music of the spheres  Which since the birth of time  Have in according chime  And fair proportion rolling round  With each diviner sound  Attentive Silence pierc'd thy list'ning ears  Unheard by all but those alone  Whom to wisdom's secret throne  The Muse with heav'ntaught guidance deigns to bring  To trace the sacred paths with hallowed feet  Or Fancy who the mystic shade  In thy airy car pervade  Where Plato's raptur'd spirit holds its solemn seat  IV  But Fancy downward urge thy flight  On some mountain's towering height  With hoary frosts eternal crown'd  Rapt with dusky vapours round  Let me fix my stedfast feet  I feel I feel the fanning gales  The wat'ry mists beneath retreat  The noontide ray now darts its heat  And pours its glories o'er the vales  Glittering to the dancing beams  Urging their stubborn way the rocks among  I hear and see a thousand streams  Foam and roar and rush along  But to the plains descended  Their sudden rage is ended  Now lost in deep recess of darksome bowers  Again now sparkling thro' the meads  Vested soft with vernal flowers  Reflecting the majestic towers  Its peaceful flood the roving channel leads  There the rural cots are seen  From whose low roof the curling smoke ascends  And dims with blueish volumes all the green  There some forest far extends  Its groves embrown'd with lengthen'd shade  Embosom'd where some Gothic seat  Of monarchs once retreat  In wild magnificence array'd  The pride of ancient times presents  And lifts in contrast fair display'd  Its sunreflecting battlements  V  Near some imperial city seems to reign  Triumphant o'er the subject land  With domes of art Vitruvian crown'd  See gleam her gilded spires around  Her gates in aweful grandeur stand  Equal to shine in peace or war sustain  Her mighty bulwarks threat the plain  With many a work of death and armed mound  Where rolls her wealthy river deep and wide  Tall groves of crowded masts arise  Their streamers waving to the skies  The banks are white with swelling sails  And distant vessels stem the tide  Circling thro' pendant cliffs and watery dales  The russet hills the valleys green beneath  The sallows brown and dusky heath  The yellow corn empurpled vine  In union soft their tints combine  And Fancy all engage thine eye  With a sweet variety  While clouds the fleeting clouds pursue  In mutual shade and mutual light  The changing landscape meets the sight  'Till the ken no more can view  And heaven appears to meet the ground  The rising lands and azure distance drown'd  Amid the gay horizon's golden bound  VI  Such are the scenes that oft invite  To feed thee Fancy with delight  All that nature can create  Beauteous aweful new and great  Sweet enthusiast is thy treasure  Source of wonder and of pleasure  Every sense to transport winning  Still unbounded and beginning  Then Fancy spread thy wings again  Unlock the caverns of the main  Above beneath and all around  Let the tumbling billows spread  'Till the coral floor we tread  Exploring all the wealth that decks the realms profound  There gather gems that long have glow'd  In the vast unknown abode  The jasper vein'd the saphire blue  The ruby bright with crimson hue  Whate'er the bed resplendent paves  Or decks the glittering roofs on high  Thro' whose translucent arch are seen the rolling waves  Fancy these shall clasp thy vest  With these thy lovely brows be drest  In every gay and various dye  But harkthe seas begin to roar  The whistling winds assault my ear  The lou'ring storms around appear  Fancy bear me to the shore  There in thy realms bright goddess deign  Secure to fix thy votary's feet  O give to follow oft thy train  Still with accustom'd lay thy power to greet  To dwell with Peace and sport with thee  Fancy ever fair and free  An Address to his Elbowchair new cloath'd  By the late WM SOMERVILE  Esq  Author of the Chace  Written towards the close of Mr  Somervile's  life  MY dear companion and my faithful friend  If Orpheus taught the listening oaks to bend  If stones and rubbish at Amphion's call  Danc'd into form and built the Theban wall  Why should'st not  thou  attend my humble lays  And hear my grateful harp resound thy praise  True thou art spruce and fine a very beau  But what are trappings and external show  To real worth alone I make my court  Knaves are my scorn and coxcombs are my sport  Once I beheld thee far less trim and gay  Ragged disjointed and to worms a prey  The safe retreat of every lurking mouse  Derided shun'd the lumber of my house  Thy robe how chang'd from what it was before  Thy velvet robe which pleas'd my sires of yore  Tis thus capricious Fortune wheels us round  Aloft we mountthen tumble to the ground  Yet grateful  then  my constancy I prov'd  I knew thy worth my friend in rags I lov'd  I lov'd thee  more  nor like a courtier spurn'd  My benefactor when the tide was turn'd  With conscious shame yet frankly I confess  That in my youthful daysI lov'd thee less  Where vanity where pleasure call'd I stray'd  And every wayward appetite obey'd  But sage experience taught me how to prize  Myself and how this world she bade me rise  To nobler flights regardless of a race  Of factious emmets pointed where to place  My bliss and lodg'd me in thy soft embrace  Here on thy yielding down I sit secure  And patiently what heav'n has sent endure  From all the futile cares of business free  Not  fond  of life but yet content to  be  Here mark the fleeting hours regret the past  And seriously prepare to meet the last  So safe on shore the pension'd sailor lies  And all the malice of the storm defies  With ease of body blest and peace of mind  Pities the restless crew he left behind  Whilst in his cell he meditates alone  On his great voyage to the world unknown  SONG  By the Same  AS o'er Asteria's fields I rove  The blissful seat of peace and love  Ten thousand beauties round me rise  And mingle pleasure with surprize  By nature blest in every part  Adorn'd with every grace of art  This paradise of blooming joys  Each raptur'd sense at once employs  II  But when I view the radiant queen  Who form'd this fair enchanting scene  Pardon ye grots ye crystal floods  Ye breathing flow'rs ye shady woods  Your coolness now no more invites  No more your murmuring stream delights  Your sweets decay your verdure's flown  My soul's intent on her alone  ODE to a FRIEND wounded in a Duel  HOW long shall tyrant Custom bind  In slavish chains the human mind  How long shall false fantastic Honour draw  The vengeful sword with fury fell  And ranc'rous Malice dark as hell  In spight of Reason's rule and Nature's eldest law  Too many gallant youths have bled  Too much of British blood been shed  By Britons' swords and that foul monster's laws  Youths that might else have nobly dar'd  More glorious wounds and dangers shar'd  For Britain's just defence and virtue's injur'd cause  So when the fierce Cadmean youth  Sprung from the dragon's venom'd tooth  Each chief arose in shining armour drest  With rage inspir'd the furious band  Soon found a ready foe at hand  And plung'd the pointed steel each in a brother's breast  Has Britain then no other foes  That thus her sons their lives expose  To private war and feuds and civil fray  Does Spain insult her flag no more  Does Lewis yet his thoughts give o'er  Of universal rule and arbitrary sway  'Tis Britons' to support the law  'Tis theirs ambitious kings to awe  And equal rights of empire to maintain  For this our fathers brave and stout  At Agincourt and Cressy fought  And heap'd fam'd Blenheim's field with mountains of the slain  How will the Gallic monarch smile  To see the sons of Albion's isle  Their country's blood with ruthless weapons drain  Themselves avenge the glorious day  When Marlb'rough swept whole hosts away  And sent the frighted Danube purple to the main  O say in this inglorious strife  Thy arm had robb'd thy friend of life  What pangs what anguish had thy bosom prov'd  How hadst thou curs'd the cruel deed  That caus'd the gallant youth to bleed  Pierc'd by thy guilty sword and slain by him he lov'd  How did the fair Maria blame  Thy highbred spirit's eager flame  That courting danger slighted her soft love  Far other wreaths for thee she twin'd  Far other cares for thee design'd  And for the laurel crown the myrtle chaplet wove  If not for her's for Britain's sake  Forbear thy precious life to stake  Nor taint thy honour with so foul a deed  One day thy country may require  Thy gallant arm and martial fire  Then may'st thou bravely conquer or as bravely bleed  ODE to NIGHT  THE busy cares of day are done  In yonder western cloud the sun  Now sets in other worlds to rise  And glad with night the nether skies  With ling'ring pace the parting day retires  And slowly leaves the mountain tops and gilded spires  Yon azure cloud enrob'd with white  Still shoots a gleam of

the song  Yon' bulfinch with unvary'd tone  Of cadence harsh and accent shrill  Has brighter plumage to attone  For want of harmony and skill  Yet discontent with nature's boon  Like man to mimick art he flies  On operapinions hoping soon  Unrival'd he shall mount the skies  And while to please some courtly fair  He one dull tune with labour learns  A wellgilt cage remote from air  And faded plumes

 Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes  Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros  TO you whose groves protect the feather'd quires  Who lend their artless notes a willing ear  To you whom pity moves and taste inspires  The Doric strain belongs O Shenstone hear  'Twas gentle spring when all the tuneful race  By nature taught in nuptial leagues combine  A goldfinch joy'd to meet the warm embrace  And hearts and fortunes with her mate to join  Thro' Nature's spacious walks at large they rang'd  No settled haunts no fix'd abode their aim  As chance or fancy led their path they chang'd  Themselves in every vary'd scene the same  'Till on a day to weighty cares resign'd  With mutual choice alternate they agreed  On rambling thoughts no more to turn their mind  But settle soberly and raise a breed  All in a garden on a currantbush  With wond'rous art they built their waving seat  In the next orchat liv'd a friendly thrush  Nor distant far a woodlark's soft retreat  Here blest with ease and in each other blest  With early songs they wak'd the sprightly groves  'Till time matur'd their bliss and crown'd their nest  With infant pledges of their faithful loves  And now what transport glow'd in either's eye  What equal fondness dealt th' allotted food  What joy each other's likeness to descry  And future sonnets in the chirping brood  But ah what earthly happiness can last  How does the fairest purpose often fail  A truantschoolboy's wantonness could blast  Their rising hopes and leave them both to wail  The most ungentle of his tribe was he  No gen'rous precept ever touch'd his heart  With concords false and hideous prosody  He scrawl'd his task and blunder'd o'er his part  On barb'rous plunder bent with savage eye  He mark'd where wrapt in down the younglins lay  Then rushing seiz'd the wretched family  And bore them in his impious hands away  But how shall I relate in numbers rude  The pangs for poor  Chrysomitris it seems is the name for a goldfinch  Chrysomitris decreed  When from a neighb'ring spray aghast she view'd  The savage ruffian's inauspicious deed  So wrapt in grief some heartstruck matron stands  While horrid flames surround her children's room  On heav'n she calls and wrings her trembling hands  Constrain'd to see but not prevent their doom  "O grief of griefs with shrieking voice she cry'd  "What sight is this that I have liv'd to see  "O that I had a maidengoldfinch died  "From love's false joys and bitter sorrows free  "Was it for this alas with weary bill  "Was it for this I pois'd th' unwieldy straw  "For this I pick'd the moss from yonder hill  "Nor shun'd the pond'rous chat along to draw  "Was it for this I cull'd the wool with care  "And strove with all my skill our work to crown  "For this with pain I bent the stubborn hair  "And lin'd our cradle with the thistle's down  "Was it for this my freedom I resign'd  "And ceas'd to rove from beauteous plain to plain  "For this I sate at home whole days confin'd  "And bore the scorching heat and pealing rain  "Was it for this my watchful eyes grow dim  "The crimson roses on my cheek turn pale  Pale is my golden plumage once so trim  "And all my wonted spirits 'gin to fail  O plund'rer vile O more than weezel fell  "More treach'rous than the cat with prudish face  "More fierce than kites with whom the furies dwell  "More pilf'ring than the cuckow's prowling race  "For thee may plumb or goosb'ry never grow  "No juicy currant cool thy clammy throat  "But bloody birchtwigs work thee shameful woe  "Nor ever goldfinch cheer thee with her note"  Thus sang the mournful bird her piteous tale  The piteous tale her mournful mate return'd  Then side by side they sought the distant vale  And there in silent sadness inly mourn'd  The BLACKBIRDS An Elegy  By the same  THE sun had chas'd the mountain snow  And kindly loos'd the frozen soil  The melting streams began to flow  And plowmen urg'd their annual toil  'Twas then amid the vocal throng  Whom nature wakes to mirth and love  A blackbird rais'd his am'rous song  And thus it echo'd thro' the grove  O fairest of the feather'd train  For whom I sing for whom I burn  Attend with pity to my strain  And grant my love a kind return  For see the wintry storms are flown  And gentle Zephyrs fan the air  Let us the genial influence own  Let us the vernal pastime share  The raven plumes his jetty wing  To please his croaking paramour  The larks responsive ditties sing  And tell their passion as they soar  But trust me love the raven's wing  Is not to be compar'd with mine  Nor can the lark so sweetly sing  As I who strength with sweetness join  O let me all thy steps attend  I'll point new treasures to thy sight  Whether the grove thy wish befriend  Or hedgerows green or meadows bright  I'll shew my love the clearest  ill  Whose streams among the pebbles stray  These will we sip and sip our fill  Or on the flow'ry margin play  I'll lead her to the thickest brake  Impervious to the schoolboy's eye  For her the plaister'd nest I'll make  And on her downy pinions lie  When prompted by a mother's care  Her warmth shall form th' imprisoned young  The pleasing task I'll gladly share  Or cheer her labours with my song  To bring her food I'll range the fields  And cull the best of every kind  Whatever nature's bounty yields  And love's assiduous care can find  And when my lovely mate would stray  To taste the summer sweets at large  I'll wait at home the livelong day  And tend with care our little charge  Then prove with me the sweets of love  With me divide the cares of life  No bush shall boast in all the grove  So fond a mate so blest a wife  He ceas'd his song The melting dame  With soft indulgence heard the strain  She felt she own'd a mutual flame  And hasted to relieve his pain  He led her to the nuptial bower  And nestled closely to her side  The fondest bridegroom of that hour  And she the most delighted bride  Next morn he wak'd her with a song  "Behold he said the newborn day  "The lark his matin peal has rung  "Arise my love and come away"  Together thro' the fields they stray'd  And to the murm'ring riv'let's side  Renew'd their vows and hopp'd and play'd  With honest joy and decent pride  When oh with grief the Muse relates  The mournful sequel of my tale  Sent by an order from the fates  A gunner met them in the vale  Alarm'd the lover cry'd My dear  Haste haste away

the smiles of my fair  As freedom inspir'd me I rang'd and I sung  And Daphne's dear name never fell from my tongue  And if once a smooth accent delighted my ear  I should wish unawares that my Daphne might hear  With fairest ideas my bosom I stor'd  Allusions to none but the nymph I ador'd  And the more I with study my fancy refin'd  The deeper impressions she made on my mind  Ah whilst I the beauties of nature pursue  I still must my Daphne's fair image renew  The Graces have chosen with Daphne to rove  And the Muses are all in alliance with Love  II DAPHNE'S Visit  YE birds for whom I rear'd the grove  With melting lay salute my love  My Daphne with your notes detain  Or I have rear'd my grove in vain  Ye flow'rs before her footsteps rise  Display at once your brightest dyes  That she your opening charms may see  Or what were all your charms to me  Kind Zephyr brush each fragrant flow'r  And shed its odours round my bow'r  Or never more O gentle wind  Shall I from thee refreshment find  Ye streams if e'er your banks I lov'd  If e'er your native sounds improv'd  May each soft murmur soothe my fair  Or oh 'twill deepen my despair  And thou my grot whose lonely bounds  The melancholy pine surrounds  May Daphne praise thy peaceful gloom  Or thou shalt prove her Damon's tomb  III The ROSEBUD  SEE Flavia see that budding rose  How bright beneath the bush it glows  How safely there it lurks conceal'd  How quickly blasted when reveal'd  The sun with warm attractive rays  Tempts it to wanton in the blaze  A blast descends from eastern skies  And all its blushing radiance dies  Then guard my fair your charms divine  And check the fond desire to shine  Where fame's transporting rays allure  While here more happy more secure  The breath of some neglected maid  Shall make you sigh you left the shade  A breath to beauty's bloom unkind  As to the rose an eastern wind  The nymph reply'd "You first my swain  "Confine your sonnets to the plain  "One envious tongue alike disarms  "You of your wit me of my charms  "What is unheard the tuneful thrill  "Or what unknown the poet's skill  "What unadmir'd a charming mien  "Or what the rose's blush unseen"  IV Written in a Collection of Bacchanalian Songs  ADIEU ye jovial youths who join  To plunge old Care in floods of wine  And as your dazled eyeballs roll  Discern him struggling in the bowl  Nor yet is hope so wholly flown  Nor yet is thought so tedious grown  But limpid stream and shady tree  Retain as yet some sweets for me  And see thro' yonder silent grove  See yonder does my Daphne rove  With pride her footsteps I pursue  And bid your frantick joys adieu  The sole confusion I admire  Is that my Daphne's eyes inspire  I scorn the madness you approve  And value reason next to love  V Imitated from the FRENCH  YES these are the scenes where with Iris I stray'd  But short was her sway for so lovely a maid  In the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run  In the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun  Illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove  So fatal to beauty so killing to love  Yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains  Once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains  How many soft moments I spent in this grove  How fair was my nymph and how fervent my love  Be still tho' my heart thine emotion give o'er  Remember the season of love is no more  With her how I stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs  Or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs  Then breathless with ardor my fairone pursu'd  And to think with what kindness my garland she view'd  But be still my fond heart this emotion give o'er  Fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more  RURAL INSCRIPTIONS  By the Same  On a ROOTHOUSE  HERE in cool grot and mossy cell  We rural fays and faeries dwell  Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye  When the pale moon ascending high  Darts thro' yon' limes her quivering beams  We frisk it near these crystal streams  Her beams reflected from the wave  Afford the light our revels crave  The turf with daisies broider'd o'er  Exceeds we wot the Parian floor  Nor yet for artful strains we call  But listen to the water's fall  Would you then taste our tranquil scene  Be sure your bosoms be serene  Devoid of hate devoid of strife  Devoid of all that poisons life  And much it 'vails you in their place  To graft the love of human race  And tread with awe these favour'd bow'rs  Nor wound the shrubs nor bruise the flow'rs  So may your paths with sweets abound  So may your couch with rest be crown'd  But harm betide the wayward swain  Who dares our hallow'd haunt profane  OBERON▪  II In a shady Valley near a running Water  O Let me haunt this peaceful shade  Nor let ambition e'er invade  The tenants of this leafy bow'r  That shun her paths and slight her pow'r  Hither the plaintive halcyon flies  From social meads and open skies  Pleas'd by this rill her course to steer  And hide her saphire plumage here  The trout bedropt with crimson stains  Forsakes the river's proud domains  Forsakes the sun's unwelcome gleam  To lurk within this humble stream  And sure I heard the Naiad say  "Flow flow my stream this devious way  "Tho' lovely soft thy murmurs are  "Thy waters lovely cool and fair  "Flow gentle stream nor let the vain  "Thy small unfully'd stores disdain  "Nor let the pensive sage repine  "Whose latent course resembles thine"  III On a small Building in the Gothick Taste  O You that bathe in courtly blysse  Or toyle in fortune's giddye spheare  Doo not too rashlye deeme amysse  Of him that bydes contentid here  Nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale  Whyche o'er each carelesse lymbe he flyngs  Nor yet deryde the beechen bowle  In whyche he quaffs the lympid spryngs  Forgyve hym if at eve or dawne  Devoyde of worldlye carke he stray  Or all besyde some flowerye lawne  He waste his inoffensive day  So man  He  pardonne fraud and strife  If such in courtlye haunt he see  For faults there beene in busye lyfe  From whyche these peacefull glennes are free  A Pastoral BALLAD in Four Parts Written  By the Same  Arbusta humilesque myricae  VIRG  I ABSENCE  I  YE shepherds so cheerful and gay  Whose flocks never carelessly roam  Should Corydon's happen to stray  Oh call the poor wanderers home  Allow me to muse and to sigh  Nor talk of the change that ye find  None once was so watchful as I  I have left my dear Phyllis behind  II  Now I know what it is to have strove  With the torture of doubt and desire  What it is to admire and to love  And to leave her we love and admire  Ah lead forth my flock in the morn  And the damps of each ev'ning repell  Alas I am faint and forlorn  I have bade my dear Phyllis farewell  III  Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look  I never once dreamt of my vine  May I lose both my pipe and my crook  If I knew of a kid that was mine  I priz'd every hour that went by  Beyond all that had pleas'd me before  But now they are past and I sigh  And I grieve that I priz'd them no more  IV  But why do I languish in vain  Why wander thus pensively here  Oh why did I come from the plain  Where I fed on the smiles of my dear  They tell me my favourite maid  The pride of that valley is flown  Alas where with her I have stray'd  I could wander with pleasure alone  V  When forc'd the fair nymph to forego  What anguish I felt at my heart  Yet I thoughtbut it might not be so  'Twas with pain that she saw me depart  She gaz'd as I slowly withdrew  My path I could hardly discern  So sweetly she bade me adieu  I thought that she bade me return  VI  The pilgrim that journeys all day  To visit some fardistant shrine  If he bear but a relique away  Is happy nor heard to repine  Thus widely remov'd from the fair  Where my vows my devotion I owe  Soft hope is the relique I bear  And my solace wherever I go  II HOPE  I  MY banks they are furnish'd with bees  Whose murmur invites one to sleep  My grottos are shaded with trees  And my hills are whiteover with sheep  I seldom have met with a loss  Such health do my fountains bestow  My fountains all border'd with moss  Where the harebells and violets grow  II  Not a pine in my grove is there seen  But with tendrils of woodbine is bound  Not a beech's more beautiful green  But a sweetbriar twines it around  Not my fields in the prime of the year  More charms than my cattle unfold  Not a brook that is limpid and clear  But it glitters with fishes of gold  III  One would think she might like to retire  To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear  Not a shrub that I heard her admire  But I hasted and planted it there  O how sudden the jessamin strove  With the lilac to render it gay  Already it calls for my love  To prune the wild branches away  IV  From the plains from the woodlands and groves  What strains of wild melody flow  How the nightingales warble their loves  From thickets of roses that blow  And when her bright form shall appear  Each bird shall harmoniously join  In a concert so soft and so clear  Asshe may not be fond to resign  V  I have found out a gift for my fair  I have found where the woodpigeons breed  But let me that plunder forbear  She will say 'twas a barbarous deed  For he ne'er could be true she aver'd  Who could rob a poor bird of its young  And I lov'd her the more when I heard  Such tenderness fall from her tongue  VI  I have heard her with sweetness unfold  How that pity was due toa dove  That it ever attended the bold  And she call'd it the sister of love  But her words such a pleasure convey  So much I her accents adore  Let her speak and whatever she say  Methinks I should love her the more  VII  Can a bosom so gentle remain  Unmov'd when her Corydon sighs  Will a nymph that is fond of the plain  These plains and this valley despise  Dear regions of silence and shade  Soft scenes of contentment and ease  Where I could have pleasingly stray'd  If aught in her absence could please  VIII  But where does my Phyllida stray  And where are her grots and her bow'rs  Are the groves and the valleys as gay  And the shepherds as gentle as ours  The groves may perhaps be as fair  And the face of the valleys as fine  The swains may in manners compare  But their love is not equal to mine  III SOLICITUDE  I  WHY will you my passion reprove  Why term it a folly to grieve  Ere I shew you the charms of my love  She is fairer than you can believe  With her mien she enamours the brave  With her wit she engages the free  With her modesty pleases the grave  She is ev'ry way pleasing to me  II  O you that have been of her train  Come and join in my amorous lays  I could lay down my life for the swain  That will sing but a song in her praise  When he sings may the nymphs of the town  Come trooping and listen the while  Nay on Him let not Phillida frown  But I cannot allow her to smile  III  For when Paridel tries in the dance  Any favour with Phyllis to find  O how with one trivial glance  Might she ruin the peace of my mind  In ringlets He dresses his hair  And his crook is bestudded around  And his pipeoh may Phyllis beware  Of a magic there is in the sound  IV  'Tis His with mock passion to glow  'Tis His in smooth tales to unfold  "How her face is as bright as the snow  "And her bosom be sure is as cold  "How the nightingales labour the strain  "With the notes of his charmer to vie  "How they vary their accents in vain  "Repine at her triumphs and die"  V  To the grove or the garden he strays  And pillages every sweet  Then suiting the wreath to his lays  He throws it at Phyllis's feet  "O Phyllis he whispers more fair  "More sweet than the jessamin's flow'r  "What are pinks in a morn to compare  "What is eglantine after a show'r  VI  "Then the lily no longer is white  "Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom  "Then the violets die with despight  "And the woodbines give up their perfume"  Thus glide the soft numbers along  And he fancies no shepherd his peer  Yet I never should envy the song  Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear  VII  Let his crook be with hyacinths bound  So Phyllis the trophy despise  Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd  So they shine not in Phillis's eyes  The language that flows from the heart  Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue  Yet may she beware of his art  Or sure I must envy the song  IV DISAPPOINTMENT  I  YE shepherds give ear to my lay  And take no more heed of my sheep  They have nothing to do but to stray  I have nothing to do but to weep  Yet do not my folly reprove  She was fair and my passion begun  She smil'd and I could not but love  She is faithless and I am undone  II  Perhaps I was void of all thought  Perhaps it was plain to foresee  That a nymph so compleat would be sought  By a swain more engaging than me  Ah love ev'ry hope can inspire  It banishes wisdom the while  And the lip of the nymph we admire  Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile  III  She is faithless and I am undone  Ye that witness the woes I endure  Let reason instruct you to shun  What it cannot instruct you to cure  Beware how ye Ioiter in vain  Amid nymphs of an higher degree  It is not for me to explain  How fair and how fickle they be  IV  Alas from the day that we met  What hope of an end to my woes  When I cannot endure to forget  The glance that undid my repose  Yet time may diminish the pain  The flow'r and the shrub and the tree  Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain  In time may have comfort for me  V  The sweets of a dewsprinkled rose  The sound of a murmuring stream  The peace which from solitude flows  Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme  High transports are shewn to the sight  But we are not to find them our own  Fate never bestow'd such delight  As I with my Phyllis had known  VI  O ye woods spread your branches apace  To your deepest recesses I fly  I would hide with the beasts of the chace  I would vanish from every eye  Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove  With the same sad complaint it begun  How she smil'd and I could not but love  Was faithless and I am undone  INDEX to the Fourth Volume  ELEGY in a Country Churchyard  Page  Hymn to Adversity    Education a Poem    Penshurst    To the Hon  Wilmot Vaughan  Esq  in  Wales    Epistle
