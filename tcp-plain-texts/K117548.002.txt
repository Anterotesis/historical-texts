 THE CONNOISSEUR  BY M  R  TOWN CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  VOL II  Non de villis domibusve alienis  Nec male necne Lepos saltet sed quod magis ad nos  Pertinet et nescire malum est agitamus  HOR  LONDON  Printed for R BALDWIN at the  Rose  in  PaternosterRow  MDCCLVI  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXI THURSDAY  June    Est brevitate opus ut currat sententia neu se  Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures  Et sermone opus est modò tristi saepe jocoso  HOR  A  MONG the several degrees of authors there are none perhaps who have more obstacles to surmount at their setting out than the writers of periodical essays Talk with a modern critic and he will tell you that to set up a new paper is a vain attempt after the inimitable SPECTATORS and others that the subjects are already pre∣occupied and that it is equally impossible to find out a new field for observation as to discover a new world With these prejudices the public are prepared to receive us and while they expect to be cloyed with the stale repetition of the same fare though tossed up in a different manner they have but little relish for the entertainment  THAT the SPECTATOR first led the way must undoubt∣edly be acknowledged but that his followers must for that reason be always supposed to tread in his steps can by no means be allowed In the high road of life there are several extensive walks as well as byepaths which we may strike into without the necessity of keeping the same beaten track with those that have gone before us New objects for ridicule will continually present themselves and even the same characters will appear different by being differently disposed as in the same pack of cards though ever so often shuffled there will never be two hands exactly alike  AFTER this introduction I hope to be pardoned if I in∣dulge myself in speaking a word or two concerning my own endeavours to entertain the public which I imagine I could never do with so good a grace as at the beginning of my second volume And first whatever objections the reader may have had to the subjects of my papers I shall make no apology for the manner in which I have chose to treat them The dread of falling into what they are pleased to call colloquial barbarisms has induced some unskilful writers to swell their bloated diction with uncouth phrases and the affected jargon of pedants For my own part I never go out of the common way of expression merely for the sake of introducing a more sounding word with a  Latin  termination The  English  language is sufficiently co∣pious and expressive without any further adoption of new terms and the native words seem to me to have far more force than any foreign auxiliaries however pompously ushered in as  British  soldiers fight our battles better than the troops taken into our pay  THE subjects of my essays have been chiefly such as I thought might recommend themselves to the public notice by being new and uncommon For this reason I purposely avoided the worn out practice of retailing scraps of mora∣lity and affecting to dogmatize on the common duties of life In this point indeed the SPECTATOR is inimitable nor could I hope to say any thing new upon these topics after so many excellent moral and religious essays which are the principal ornament of his work I have therefore contented myself with exposing vice and folly by painting the actors in their natural colours without assuming the rigidness of a preacher or the moroseness of a philosopher I have oftener chose to undermine our fashionable excesses by secret sapping than to storm them by open assaults In a word upon all occasions I have endeavoured to laugh peo∣ple into a better behaviour as I am convinced that the sting of reproof is not less sharp for being concealed and advice never comes with a better face than when it comes with a laughing one  THERE are some points in the course of this work which perhaps might have been treated of with a more serious air I have thought it my duty to take every opportunity of ex∣posing the absurd tenets of our modern freethinkers and enthusiasts The enthusiast is indeed much more difficult to cure than the freethinker because the latter with all his bravery cannot but be conscious that he is wrong whereas the former has perhaps deceived himself into a be∣lief that he is certainly in the right and the more he is op∣posed the more he considers himself as  "patiently suffer∣ing for the truth's sake"  Ignorance is too stubborn to yield to conviction and on the other hand those whom  "a little learning has made mad"  are too proud and self∣sufficient to hearken to the sober voice of reason The only way left us therefore is to root out superstition by making its followers ashamed of themselves and as for our freethinkers it is but right to turn their boasted weapons of ridicule against them and as they them∣selves endeavour to banter all others out of their serious and virtuous notions we too in the language of the Psalmist should  "laugh them to scorn and have them in derision"  BUT whatever merit I may assume to myself from my writings I must at the same time confess myself indebted to several correspondents for many excellent pieces and more particularly to the gentlemen who have signed themselves A B and G K As I know not the real names of any of my correspondents I am not without some hopes that I have been honoured by an Earl or a Right Honourable at least for to say the truth I cannot at present apply to myself the known boast of  Terence  Homines nobiles  Eum adjutare assiduèque unà scribere  IT is with infinite pleasure that I find myself so much encouraged to continue my labours by the kind reception which they have hitherto met with from the public and Mr  Baldwin  with no less pleasure informs me that as there are but few numbers left of the present edition he intends to collect them into Two Pocket Volumes The reader cannot conceive how much I already pride myself on the charming figure which my works will make in this new  form and I shall endeavour to render these volumes as complete as I possibly can by several considerable additions and amendments Though contracted into the small space of a twelves volume I still hope to maintain my former dignity like the Devils in  Milton's Pandaemonium  who  To smallest forms  Reduc'd their shapes immense and were at large  THE SPECTATOR has very elegantly compared his single papers as they came out to  "cherries on a stick"  of the dearness of which the purchasers cannot complain who are willing to gratify their taste with choice fruit at its earliest production I have considered my own papers as so many flowers which joined together would make up a pretty nosegay and though each of them singly taken may not be equally admired for their odours they may receive an additional fragrance by an happy union of their sweets  CUSTOM hath lately introduced a new fashion among essaywriters of giving translations of the mottos for the benefit of the ladies But as  Denham  has remarked of translation in general  "the spirit of the original is evapo∣rated in the transfusion and nothing is left behind but a mere  caput mortuum  "  Translations however must be given and it has been the usual way to copy them pro∣miscuously from  Dryden  or  Francis  though they are gene∣rally very wide of the intended sense of the original and not unfrequently nothing to the purpose For this reason I de∣sign to give new translations or rather imitations of all the mottos and quotations adapted to the present times Some of these will admit of epigrammatic turns and many of  them will afford room for lively and picturesque allu∣sions to modern manners In this dress they will at least appear more of a piece with the essays themselves and not like the patchwork of random translations  IN the mean time I shall only add that if any Noble∣man Gentleman or Rich Citizen is ambitious to have his name prefixed to either of these volumes he is desired to send in proposals together with a list of his virtues and good qualities to the publisher and the Dedications shall be disposed of to the best bidder  {inverted ⁂}None but principals will be treated with  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXII THURSDAY  June    Versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae  HOR  T  HE managers of our Public Gardens willing to make their summer diversions as com∣plete as possible are not content with laying out beautiful walks and providing an excel∣lent band of music but are also at much expence to amuse us with the old  English  entertainment of Balladsinging For this end they not only retain the best voices that can be procured but each of them also has a poet in ordinary who is allowed a stated salary and the run of the Gardens The productions of these petty lau∣reats naturally come within my notice as CRITIC and indeed whether I am at  Vauxhall Ranelagh Marybone  or even  Sadler's Wells  I indulge myself in many remarks on the poetry of the place and am as attentive to the songs as to the Cascade the Fireworks or Miss  Isabella Wilkinson  BALLADS seem peculiarly adapted to the genius of our people and are a species of composition in which we are superior to all other nations Many of our old  English  Songs have in them an affecting simplicity and it is re∣markable that our best writers have not been ashamed to cultivate this branch of poetry  Cowley Waller Rofcommon Rowe Gay Prior  and many others have left behind them very elegant Ballads but it must be confessed to the honour of the present age that it was reserved for our modern writers to bring this kind of poetry to perfection Songwriting is now reduced to certain rules of art and the Balladmaker goes to work by a method as regular and me∣chanical as a carpenter or a blacksmith  SWIFT in his "Voyage to  Laputa  " describes a ma∣chine to write books in all arts and sciences I have also read of a mill to make verses and remember to have seen a curious table by the assistance of which the most illiterate might amuse themselves in composing hexameters and pentameters in  Latin  Inventions wonderfully calculated for the promotion of literature Whatever gentlemen of  Grubstreet  or others are ambitious to inlist themselves as hackney sonetteers are desired to attend to the following rules drawn from the practice of our modern songwriters a set of geniusses excellent in their manner and who will probably be hereafter as much known and admired as GardenPoets as the celebrated  Taylor  is now famous under the denomination of WaterPoet  I MUST beg leave possitively to contradict any reports insinuating that our Balladmakers are in possession of such a machine mill or table as abovementioned and believe  it to be equally false that it is their practice to hustle certain quaint terms and phrases together in a hat and take them out at random It has indeed been asserted on some just ground that their productions are totally void of sense and expression that they have little rhyme and less reason and that they are from beginning to end nothing more than nonsensical rhapsodies to a new tune This charge I do not mean to deny though I cannot but lament the deplorable want of taste that mentions it as a fault For it is this very circumstance which I who am professedly a CONNOISSEUR particularly admire It is a received maxim with all composers of music that nothing is so melodious as nonsense Manly sense is too harsh and stubborn to go through the numberless divisions and sub∣divisions of modern music and to be trilled forth in crotchets and demiquavers For this reason thought is so cautiously sprinkled over a modern song which it is the business of the singer to warble into harmony and sentiment  OUR Balladmakers for the most part slide into the familiar stile and affect that easy manner of writing which accord∣ing to  Wycherley  is easily written Seeing the dangerous consequence of meaning in words adapted to music they are very frugal of sentiment and indeed they husband it so well that the same thoughts are adapted to every song The only variation requisite in twenty ballads is that the last line of the stanza be different In this ingenious line the wit of the whole song consists and the author whether  he shall die if he has not the lass of the mill  or  deserves to be reckon'd an ass  turns over his dictionary of rhymes for words of a similar sound and every verse jingles to the same word  with all the agreeable variety of a set of bells eternally ring∣ing the same peal  THE authors of lovesongs formerly wasted a great deal of poetry in illustrating their own passion and the beauty of their mistress but our modern poets content themselves with falling in love with her name There cannot be a greater misfortune to one of these rhymers than a mistress with a hard name such a misfortune sends them all over the world and makes them run through all arts sciences and languages for correspondent terms and after all per∣haps the name is so harsh and untractable that our poet has as much difficulty to bring it into verse as the cele∣braters of the Duke of  Marlborough  were puzzled to reduce to rhyme the uncouth names of the  Dutch  Towns taken in Queen  Anne  's wars  Valentine  in  Love for Love  when he talks of turning poet orders  Jeremy  to get the maids together of an evening to Crambo no contemptible hint to our Ballad∣makers and which if properly made use of would be of as much service to them as  Byshe's Art of Poetry  FEARING lest this method of songwriting should one day grow obsolete in order to preserve to posterity some idea of it I have put together the following dialogue as a specimen of the modern manner I must however be in∣genuous enough to confess that I can claim no farther me∣rit in this elegant piece than that of a compiler It is a Canto from our most celebrated new songs from which I have carefully culled all the sweetest flowers of poetry and bound them up together for the delight and wonder of the world As all the lines are taken from different songs set to different tunes I would humbly propose that this curious  performance should be sung jointly by all the best voices in the manner of a  Dutch  concert where every man sings his own tune I had once some thoughts of affixing mar∣ginal references to each line to inform the reader by note at what place the song whence it is taken was first sung But I shall spare myself that trouble by desiring the reader to look on the whole piece as arising from a coalition of our most eminent songwriters at  Vauxhall Ranelagh Mary∣bone  and  Sadler's Wells  assuring him that this short dia∣logue contains the pith and marrow or rather to borrow an expression from the Fine Lady in  Lethe  the  Quinsetence  and  Emptity  of all our modern songs  A PASTORAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN  CORYDON  and  SARAH  Sar  AH whither so fast wou'd my  Corydon  go  Step in you've nothing else to do  Cor  They say I'm in love but I answer no no  So I wish I may die if I do  Once my heart play'd a tune that went pitty pattie  And I sigh'd but I could not tell why  Now let what will happen by Jove I'll be free  Sar  O fye Shepherd fye Shepherd fye  Cor  Tho' you bid me begone back again  Yet  Sally  no matter for that  The Women love kissing as well as the men  Sar  Why what a pox would you be at  You told me a tale of a cock and a bull  Upon my word he did  Cor  I swear I meant nothing but playing the fool  Sar  Very fine very pretty indeed  Cor  Come come my dear  Sally  to church let us go  No more let your answer be no  Sar  The duce sure is in you to plague a maid so  I cannot deny you you know  CHORUS by BOTH  No courtiers can be so happy as we  Who bill like the sparrow and dove  I love  Sue  and  Sue  loves me  Sure this is mutual love  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXIII THURSDAY  June    Secernere sacra profanis  HOR  W  ALKING the other day in  Westminster  Abbey among the many oftentatious monu∣ments erected to kings and warriors I could not help observing a little stone on which was this pompous inscription  Aeternae Memoriae Sacrum  Sacred to the Eternal Memory of The name of the person to whom immortality was thus secured is almost obliterated and perhaps when alive he was little known and as soon forgot by the small circle of his friends and acquaintance  I HAVE been used to look upon epitaphs as a kind of flattering dedications to the dead in which is set down a long catalogue of virtues that nobody knew they were  possessed of while living and not a word of their vices or follies The veracity of these posthumous encomiums may indeed be fairly suspected as we are generally told that the disconsolate widow or weeping son erected the monu∣ment in testimony of their affliction for the loss of the kind∣est husband or most affectionate father But what dowager who gets a comfortable jointure by her good man's decease would refuse to set her hand to it on his tombstone that he was the best of husbands though perhaps they had parted beds or what heir would be so base and ungrateful as not to give a few good words to a crabbed parent after his death in return for his estate  BY the extravagant praises which are indiscriminately lavished on the ashes of every person alike we entirely pervert the original intent of epitaphs which were contrived to do honour and justice to the virtuous and the good But by the present practice the reputations of men are equally con∣founded with their dust in the grave where there is no dis∣tinction between the good and the bad The law has ap∣pointed searchers to enquire when any one dies into the cause of his death in the same manner I could wish that searchers were appointed to examine into his way of living before a character be given of him upon the tombstone  THE flatteries that are paid to the deceased are un∣doubtedly owing to the pride of their survivors which is the same among the lowest as the highest set of people When an obscure grocer or tallowchandler dies at his lodg∣ings at  Islington  the newspapers are stuffed with the same parade of his virtues and good qualities as when a duke goes out of the world and the petty overseer of a little  hamlet has a painted board with the initials of his name stuck up at the end of his wicker'd turf while the noblemen reposes under a grand mausoleum erected to his memory with a long list of his titles and heroic deeds  THE Great indeed have found means to separate them∣selves even in their graves from the vulgar by having their ashes deposited in churches and cathedrals and covered by the most superb monuments In my late visit to  Westminster  Abby I could not but remark the difference of Taste which has prevailed in setting up these edifices for the dead In former times we find that they were content to clap up the bust or statue of the deceased set round perhaps with the emblems of his merits his employment or station of life If any person was remarkable for his virtue and piety it was pointed out by two or three little chubbyfaced che∣rubims who were crying for his death or holding a crown over his head The warriour was spread along at full length in a complete suit of armour with the trophies of war hung round about him and the bishop was laid flat upon his back with his coifed head resting on a stone bible and his hands joined together in the posture of praying  IF  Socrates  or any other of the ancient Philosophers could revive again and be admitted into  Westminster  Abby he would be induced to fancy himself in a  Pantheon  of the Heathen Gods The Modern Taste not content with introducing  Roman  temples into our Churches and repre∣senting the Virtues under allegorical images has ransacked all the fabulous accounts of the Heathen Theology to strike out new embellishments for our  Christian  monuments We are not in the least surprised to see  Mercury  attending  the tomb of an orator and  Pallas  or  Hercules  supporting that of a warriour  Milton  has been blamed for his frequent allusions to the Heathen Theology in his Sacred Poem but surely we are more to be condemned for admitting the whole class of their fictitious deities into the House of God itself  IF there is not a stop put to this Taste we may soon expect to see our churches instead of being dedicated to the service of religion set apart for the reception of the Heathen Gods A deceased admiral will be represented like  Neptune  with a trident in his hand drawn in a shell by dolphins preceded by  Tritons  and followed by  Nereids  lashing the marble waves with their tails A general will be habited like  Mars  bearing an helmet and spear in polished stone and a celebrated toast will be stuck up naked like the  Ve∣nus de Medicis  cut in alabaster  IT has been proposed on a different account to have a separate place distinct from our churches for the reception of our monuments I could wish to see such a scheme put in execution for the present absurd mixture of the several objects of  Pagan  and  Christian  belief as represented on the tombs lately set up in compliance of the modern taste must be shocking to every serious beholder Our pious fore∣fathers were content with exhibiting to us the usual em∣blems of death the hourglass the skull and the crossmarrowbones but these are not sufficient for our present more refined age The Three Fatal Sisters mentioned in the Heathen Mythology must be introduced spinning draw∣ing and cutting the thread of life Could one of the last century see a winged figure blowing a trumpet on the top  of a modern monument he would be apt to mistake it for an archangel and be naturally put in mind of that awful time  "when the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise"  But the design we are told is very different and this winged messenger is no other than the ancient personage of Fame who is proclaiming the virtues of the defunct round the world  SHOULD any one propose to take down from St  Paul  's Ca∣thedral those paintings of Sir  James Thornhill  representing the transactions of St  Paul  and in their place to set up  Titian  's pictures of the amours of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses every one would be shocked at the impiety of the proposal Nor is the fashion of introducing Heathen Deities into our monuments much less absurd for while any of those are suffered to remain in our Churches the reproof of our Sa∣viour concerning the Temple at  Jerusalem  may perhaps be∣come applicable to the present times  "My House is an House of Prayer but ye have made it a DEN OF THIEVES"  I HOPE I shall not be thought too grave or whimsical if I earnestly recommend it to the consideration of those whom it may concern whether a reformation is not necessary in our Churches to purge them from these prophane images which though not the objects of our idolatry have no more pretence to be set up in the Temple of the Living Lord than those of the canonized Saints of the  Roman Catholics  MODERN Taste is continually striking out new improve∣ments We may therefore conclude that when our statu∣aries  have travelled through the ancient  Pantheon  and ex∣hausted all the subjects of the  Grecian  and  Roman  Mytho∣logy we shall have recourse to the superstitions of other nations for the designs of our monuments They will then probably be adorned with  Aegyptian  Hieroglyphics and the tomb of some future hero may be built according to the model of the Prophet's tomb at  Mecca  It is not to be doubted but that the  Chinese  Taste which has been already introduced into our gardens our buildings and our furni∣ture will also soon find its way into our Churches and how elegant must a monument appear which is erected in the  Chinese  Taste and embellished with dragons bells Pagods and Mandarins  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXIV THURSDAY  June    Non ita Romuli  Praescriptum et intonsi Catonis  Auspiciis veterumque norma  HOR  T  HERE is no method of reproof more in vogue than the drawing invidious parallels between the present times and the past The grumbling politician rails over his coffee at the present ministry and reminds you with a sigh of the golden Days of Queen  Bess  while in mat∣ters of less consequence the critic shakes his head at Mr TOWN and mentions BICKERSTAFF But the mo∣ralists are above all others devoted to this practice These wise gentlemen are continually looking backwards and con∣demning what lays immediately before them by retrospect They are for ever harping on this jarring chord and have  scarce more words in their mouths than the solemn sentences said to be delivered by Fryar  Bacon's  Brazen Head  Time isTime wasTime is past  NO comparisons of this sort are so frequently repeated and so much insisted on as those drawn between the An∣cients and Moderns If an eloquent member of the House of Commons is cruelly suspected of bellowing for a place no∣thing rings in his ears but  Tully  and  Demosthenes  If a gen∣tleman or perhaps a nobleman with a heavy mortgage on his estate disencumbers it by selling his interest at a county election he is immediately upbraided with one  Roman  that was not ashamed to follow the ploughtail and another who could refuse large bribes and content himself with a cottage and turnips If a lady makes an unfortunate slip she is told again and again of  Lucretia  and fifty other schoolboy tales of honour and chastity In a word there is not one fashiona∣ble frailty but has some stubborn antiquated virtue set in oppo∣sition to it and our unhappy metropolis is every day threaten∣ed with destruction for its degeneracy from the rigid maxims of  Rome  or  Sparta  IN the midst of all these severe reflections it gives me infinite pleasure that I can with justice take notice of the incontestable superiority of the Moderns in point of Modesty The arrogance of the Ancients was so remarkable that in their idea of a perfect character they included every public and private virtue They aimed at a strict observance of all the duties of life and if some old  Romans  had been stiled Gods while living it would not have been such gross flattery as was afterwards practised in honouring the Emperors with an  Apotheosis  Their inflexible honesty was their perpetual  boast and their virtue was their pride This high idea of a Perfect Character among the Ancients naturally urged them to lift themselves to an invidious superiority above the rest of the world while the modest Moderns by taking all the vices instead of the virtues into their notion of a Fine Gentle∣man endeavour to let themselves down to a level with the lowest of their species and have laid the surest foundation for humility Fine Gentlemen are so far from being proud that they are never guilty of any thing which gives them the least reason to be so and our Fine Ladies have none of the disgusting haughtiness of virtue though indeed they are sel∣dom known to be ashamed  IT is impossible to devise one method of lowering the good opinion a man might possibly conceive of himself that has not been put in practice No Fine Gentleman ever aimed at acquiring any excellence and if any natural perfections might give some little occasion for pride the greatest pains have been taken to destroy them Good parts have been often drowned in drunkenness and a strong constitution sweated away in bagnios and in the mean time learning has been totally neglected lest improvement should bring on pedantry and literary pride The most shining parts in the character of a Fine Gentleman are that he drinks deep dresses gen∣teelly rides well can shoe his own horse and is possessed of some few other qualifications which nobody can ever sus∣pect a mind the least given to ambition would ever labour to acquire For my part I am so far from agreeing with our famous satirist that love of fame is the universal passion that when I observe the behaviour of our Fine Gentlemen I am apt to think it proceeds from the lowest and humblest turn of mind indeed their singular modesty appears to me the  only means of accounting for their actions which commonly tend to place them in the meanest and most contemp∣tible light  NOTHING but this invincible Modesty and fear of seeming to aim at excellence could ever give rise to certain habits not only ridiculous but ungraceful Good eyes for instance are universally acknowledged to give lustre to the whole coun∣tenance yet fashion and humility have blinded the whole town The beau draws his eyes out of his pocket and the beauties kill us through spyingglasses It has been known to be the vogue for persons of fashion to lose the use of their legs and limp along as if they were crippled this practice I daily expect to be revived for I take it for granted that the tall staves now carried about must naturally dwindle into crutches An inarticulate lisp even now infects the delivery in polite conversation It is not at all unfashionable to pre∣tend deafness and unless the ladies object to it I do not despair of seeing the time when the whole modish world shall affect to be dumb  THIS humble way of thinking has been carried so far that it has even introduced a new species of hypocrisy Fine Gen∣tlemen fearing lest their good qualities should in their own despite overbalance their bad ones claim several vices to which they have no title There is something very admirable and ingenuous in this disposition among our young people who not only candidly discover all their frailties but accuse them∣selves of faults which they never intended to commit I know a young fellow who is almost every morning complain∣ing of the headache and cursing the last night's champagne at the St  Alban  's when I am well assured he passed his evening  very soberly with his maiden aunts in  Cheapside  I am also acquainted with another gentleman who is very fond of con∣fessing his intrigues and often modestly takes shame to him∣self for the great mischief he does among the women though I well know he is too bashful even to make love to his laun∣dress He sometimes laments publickly the unlucky conse∣quences of an amour and has more than once been discover∣ed to send pillboxes and gallipots directed for himself to be left at the bar of neighbouring coffeehouses The same humble turn of mind induces the frugal to appear extravagant and makes many a religious young fellow deny his principles brave his conscience and affect the character and conversation of an Atheist To say the truth the generality of the gay world are arrant hypocrites in their vices and appear to be worse than they really are Many of our pretended Bloods are in fact no more drunkards whoremasters or infidels than a bully is a man of courage and are as sincere in their boasts of vice as statesmen or beauties in their mutual pro∣fessions of friendship  THAT part of the female world which composes the order of Fine Ladies have as much humility as their counterparts the Fine Gentlemen There is something so charming in the fair sex that we should almost adore them if they did not lay aside all the pride of reputation and by some goodnatured familiarities reduce themselves to an equality with us It is indeed wonderful to see with what diligence our polite ladies pare off the excellencies from their characters When we see them almost as naked as the  Graces  it is natural to suppose them as warmly devoted to  Venus  and when we hear them talk loosely and encourage double meanings in conversation we are apt to imagine their notions of honour not very strict  or severe But after all this is frequently mere hypocrisy and the effect of humility Many a lady very wanton in appear∣ance is in reality very modest and many a coquet has lost her reputation without losing her virtue I make no doubt but that several ladies of suspicious characters are not so bad as they seem and that there are honourable persons among the gayest of our women of quality  TO return whence I see set out the extraordinary Modesty of the Moderns so averse to the arrogant pride of the Ancients claiming all virtues and good qualities whatsoever is the only key to their behaviour Thus vice or at least the appear∣ance of vice becomes absolutely requisite to pass through the world with tolerable decency and the character of a man of spirit As Sir  John Brute  says  "they were sneaking dogs and afraid of being damned in those days"  but we are better informed and fear nothing but the appearance of too much virtue To secure the nobility gentry and others from so shocking an imputation I shall speedily present the world with a curious piece compiled from the practice and principles of the present times entitled  A New Treatise on Ethicks or a System of Immoral Philosophy  In this treatise I have treated at large of Modern Modesty shewn the excel∣lence and utility of Immorality and considered Drinking Whoring Fighting and Gaming as the four Cardinal Vices or in other words the principal constituents of Bucks Bloods and Fine Gentlemen  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXV THURSDAY  July    Non tu corpus eras sine pectore  HOR  G  OODNATURE is to the mind what beauty is to the body and an agreeable dis∣position creates a love and esteem for us in the rest of mankind as an handsome person recommends us to the good graces of the fairsex To say the truth any little defect in point of figure is sooner overlooked than a sourness in the temper and we conceive a more lasting disgust at a morose chur∣lishness of manners than at a humpback or a pair of bandy legs GoodNature is indeed so amiable a qualification that every man would be thought to possess it and the ladies themselves would no more like to be accused of a perverse turn of mind than of an unhappy cast of features Hence it proceeds that those unfortunate stale virgins usually call'd Old Maids have both these heavy censures  thrown upon them and are at once condemned as ugly and illnatured  SOME persons are according to the strict import of the phrase itself born GoodNatured These fortunate people are easy in themselves and agreeable to all about them They are as it were constitutionally pleasing and can no more fail of being affable and engaging in conversation than a  Hamilton  or a  Coventry  can be otherwise than beautiful and charming Yet it is the duty even of these who are naturally endowed  "with the soft parts of conversation"  to be careful not to deprave or abuse them They must not rely too confidently on their native agreeableness of temper for we should no more esteem a man who discovered a negligence of pleasing than we should admire a beauty who was an intolerable slattern Nor on the other hand should they let their GoodNature run to an excess of com∣pliment and extravagant civility for an engaging temper has been as often spoiled by this troublesome politeness as a fine shape has been squeezed into frightful distortions by bad stays and a fine complexion entirely ruined by paint  BUT if this care is requisite even in those few who are blest with this native complacency and good humour how necessary is it for the generality of mankind to labour at rectifying the irregularities in their temper For this pur∣pose it would be fully sufficient if they would employ half the art to cultivate their minds that is daily made use of to set off their persons To this important end not only the female delicacies of paint and essence are called in as auxi∣liaries to the embroidered suits and  French  perukes but this anxiety to supply any personal defect has set the invention of  artificers to work with so much earnestness that there is scarce any external blemish which may not be removed or con∣cealed and however unkindly nature may have dealt with you you may by their assistance be made a model for a statuary or a pattern for a painter to study If you want an inch in height your shoemaker can supply it and your hosier can furnish you with a pair of calves that may put an  Irishman  to the blush An irregularity in your shape can be made invisible by your taylor or at least by the artist near the  Haymarket  who daily gives notice that he makes steel stays for all those who are INCLINED  to be crooked  There are various compounds and cosmetics that will cure spots and freckles in the complexion and combs and oint∣ments that will change red hair to the finest brown Do you want an eye  Taylor  will fill the vacant socket with as bright a piercer as the family of the  Pentweazles  can boast or is your mouth  deficient  for want of teeth  Paul Jullion  to use his own phrase will  rectify your head  and fix a set in your gums as even and beautiful as ever adorned the mouth of a chimneysweeper These and many other inven∣tions as curious and extraordinary have been devised and there are no operations however painful which have not been submitted to with patience to conquer personal defor∣mities I know a gentleman who went through the agony of having his leg broke a second time because it had been set awry and I remember a lady who died of a cancer in her breast occasioned by the application of repelling plaisters to keep back her milk that the beauty of her neck might not be destroyed I most heartily wish the same resolution was discovered in improving the disposition Half the care that is taken of the body would have happy effects upon the  temper  Tully  in that part of his  Offices  where he speaks of Grace tells us  "that it is destroyed by any violent per∣turbations either of the body or mind"  It is a pity that mankind cannot be reconciled to this opinion since it is likely they would spare no pains in cultivating their minds if it tended to adorn their persons Yet it is certain that a man makes a worse figure with an ignorant pate than an un∣powdered peruke and that knowledge is a greater ornament to the head than a bag or a smart cocked hat that anger sets like a bloodshot in the eyes while goodnature lights them up with smiles and makes every feature in the face charming and agreeable There is a certain sweetness of dis∣position which is sure to procure to those who possess it the goodwill of their acquaintance but it is as ridiculous for a man to hope to be beloved while he neglects to be amiable as it would be in a lady who expects a multitude of admi∣rers to appear always in a dirty dishabille  THE difficulty of being convinced that we want this social turn is the grand reason that so little pains are taken to acquire and perfect it Would a man once be persuaded of any irregularity in his temper he would find the blemishes of the mind more easily corrected and amended than the de∣fects and deformities of the body but alas every man is in his own opinion sensible and goodhumour'd It is indeed possible to convince us that we have a bad complexion or an aukward deportment which we endeavour to amend by washes and a dancingmaster but when the mind is in fault selfadulation the most fatal species of flattery makes us cajole ourselves into a belief that the fault is not in our own disposition but in that of our companions as the mad  inhabitants of  Moorfields  conclude all that come to visit them out of their senses A whimsical person complains of the perverseness of his acquaintance and constantly ac∣cuses them of fancy and caprice and there never was an instance of a positive untoward man that did not continu∣ally rail at the stubbornness and obstinacy of the rest of the world A modern Buck damns you for a sullen fellow if you refuse a pint bumper and looks upon you as a sneaking scoundrel if you decline entering into any of his wild pranks and do not chuse to lay all night in the roundhouse It was the saying of an old philosopher that  "the eye sees not itself"  but when this blind partiality is carried so far as to make us think those guilty of the folly who make us sensible of it it is surely as absurd as to imagine that the hairlip or carbuncled nose a man sees in the glass belongs to the figure in the mirror and not to his own face This foolish flattery it is that makes us think ourselves inflexibly right while we are obstinately wrong and prevents our receiving or communicating any pleasure in society The untractable humourist while he disgusts all that are about him conceives himself to be the person affronted and la∣ments that there is no harmony in the conversation though he is himself the only one out of tune  PERFECTION is no more to be expected in the minds of men than in their persons Natural defects and irregularities in both must be overlooked and excused All I desire at present is that they would endeavour with equal earnestness to cultivate their minds as they do to adorn their persons To this end we should examine ourselves impartially and not erect ourselves into judges and treat all the rest of man∣kind like criminals Would it not be mighty ridiculous in  a person of quality to go to court in a ruff a cloak a pair of trunk breeches and the habit worn in the days of Queen  Elizabeth  and while he strutted about in this antiquated garb to accuse all the rest of the world of being out of the fashion As we are composed of a body and mind equal attention should be paid to both and we should not be anxious to cloath the person and at the same time let the mind go naked We should be equally assiduous to obtain knowledge and virtue as to put on lace and velvet and when our minds are completely dressed we should take care that goodnature and complacency influence and direct the whole which will throw the same grace over our virtues and good qualities as fine cloaths receive from being cut according to the fashion  I CANNOT conclude better than with a passage from  Swift  's  Tale of a Tub  where the strict analogy between the cloathing of the mind and the body is humourously pointed out  "Man says he is a  Microcoat  As to his body there can be no doubt but examine even the acquirements of his mind you will find them all contribute in their order towards furnishing out an exact dress To instance no more is not  religion  a cloak  honesty  a pair of shoes worn out in the dirt  selflove  a surtout  vanity  a shirt and  conscience  a pair of breeches which though a cover for lewdness as well as nastiness is easily slipt down for the service of both"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXVI THURSDAY  July    Vomeris huc falcis honos huc omnis aratri  Cessit

growl and grumble now be∣gins to roar again His tremendous voice has roused the whole nation and the mean∣est of the people breathe nothing but war and revenge The encroachments of the  French  on our colonies are the ge∣neral topic of conversation and the popular cry now runs NEW  England for ever  Peace or War has been the sub∣ject of bets at  White  's as well as debates at the  Robin Hood  and  "a Fleet roasting new world's new dress the colonies in a rope c"  were last Sunday the subjects of a  prayer and lecture at the Oratory in  Clare Market  The theatres also before they closed the season entertained us with several warlike Dramas The  Press Gang  was exhibi∣ted at  Covent Garden  and at  Drury Lane  the same sea that rolled its canvas billows in pantomime at the beginning of the season to carry  Harlequin  to  China  was again put in motion to transport our sailors to  North America  At present the streets ring with the martial strains of our ballad singers who are endeavouring like  Tyrtaeus  of old to rouse their fellow countrymen to battle while all the polite world are hurrying to  Portsmouth  to see mockfights and be regaled on board the Admiral  THIS posture of affairs has occasioned politics which have been long neglected as studies useless and impertinent to become once more fashionable Religion and politics though they naturally demand our constant attention are only cultivated in  England  by fits Christianity sleeps among us unless roused by the apprehensions of a plague an earthquake or a  Jewbill  and we are alarmed for a while at the sudden news of an invasion or a rebellion but as soon as the danger is over the  Englishman  like the soldier recovered from his fright occasioned by Queen  Mab  's drumming in his ear  "swears a prayer or two and sleeps again"  To preach up public spirit is at some seasons only blowing a dead coal but at others an accidental blast kindles the embers and they mount into flame in an instant The reign of politics seems at present to be recommencing Our news∣papers contain dark hints and shrewd conjectures from the  Hague Paris  and  Madrid  and spirited orations from  NovaScotia  and the lye of the day is artfully contrived to influence the rise and fall of the moneybarometer in  ChangeAlley  This is the present state of politics within the bills of mortality of which I shall now take no further notice but submit to the perusal of my readers the fol∣lowing letter from my Cousin VILLAGE on the same important subject  To Mr TOWN    June  DEAR COUSIN  WAR though it has not laid our fields waste or made our cities desolate engrosses almost all the at∣tention of this place Every farmhouse swarms with poli∣ticians who lay their wise heads together for the good of the nation and at every petty chandler's shop in town while the half quarterns of tea are weighed out the balance of  Europe  is adjusted The preparations now making by sea and land are as popular subjects as the price of hay or the BroadWheelAct Success to our noble admirals and a speedy war are also as common toasts over a mug of ale as a good harvest though it must be owned that some sel∣fish farmers who have not an equal share of public spirit and love of their country with their fellow rustics are somewhat apprehensive of the influence which a war may have upon the Landtax  I AM at present on a visit to Sir  Politic Hearty  who is one of those country gentlemen that are continually athirst for news and are more anxious about the affairs of the nation than the care of their own estates Sir  Politic  is miserable three days in the week for want of fresh in∣telligence but his spirits revive at the sound of the post∣horn  when the mail brings him the  Lomdon Evening Post  and a long letter of news from his nephew at the  Temple  These Sir  Politic  himself reads after dinner to me the cu∣rate of the parish and the townapothecary whom he indulges with the run of his table for their deep insight into the proceedings of the government He makes many shrewd remarks on every paragraph and frequently takes the opinion of the two Doctors for he honours both the curate and apothecary with that title on the asterisks dashes and italics He has also discovered several mysteries in his Majesty's visit to  Hanover  has elected a king of the  Romans  and laid a better plan for discharging the national debt than has ever yet been proposed by  Jacob Henriques  Many of his reflections have given me great entertainment but I was never more diverted than at the following droll incident at one of our late privy councils Sir  Politic  's nephew who it seems has made as great a proficiency in the study of the Humbug as of the law sent him down as a serious prophecy a new pamphlet humourously foretelling the des∣truction of the  French  from  Ezekiel  This the unsuspicious Baronet read very gravely over and then turning to the cu∣rate cried out  "Rare news doctorCome fill a bumper to  Old England  We have the bible of our side you see and hark ye Doctor I'd advise you as a friend to preach a sermon upon  Thou shalt be desolate  O MOUNT SEIR"  NOTHING at first puzzled the honest baronet and the rest of our country politicians so much as the new seat of war They were pretty tollerably acquainted with  Brussels Ghent Antwerp  and the other scenes of action in  Flanders  but  Virginia  the  Ohio  the Lake  Ontario  c to use a common phrase were quite out of their latitude This  difficulty was however at length surmounted by the tem∣plar's transmitting to his uncle one of  D' Anville  's maps which has enabled the baronet sometimes to delineate the progress of the  French  up the  Ohio  in meanders of port winding along the table and sometimes to demolish the forts lately raised by the enemy behind  Pensylvania  and at  Crown Point  Sir  Politic  has indeed studied Monsieur  D' Anville  very thoroughly and I dare say is better ac∣quainted with his plan of  North America  than with the map of his own estate  WAR never fails of producing several groundless and contradictory reports but if Fame is a lying jade in town she is the idlest gossip that ever spoke in the country It is impossible for you Cousin or any of your readers who reside constantly in  London  to form any tolerable idea of a country newspaper There is in this town a petty printer who sets his press to work once a week by publishing a journal which contains advices more extraordinary if not authentic than the gazette It has been his custom for some years past to raise apparitions in country churches to give accounts of battles fought in the air comets and several other preternatural phoenomena but since the rumour of a war he has dealt in nothing but skirmishes and engage∣ments He gave the  French  fleet several furious broadsides before it sailed from  Brest  and has gained us several vic∣tories in  Virginia  though in his last journal he shot off both  Boscawen  's legs and made him fight like  Wither∣ington  on his stumps and it was but yesterday that Sir  Politic  on the authority of a letter from his nephew confuted this intelligence and set the Admiral on his legs again  THIS Cousin is the present state of politics at which I think in the stile of our newspapers might cause you much speculation You would be of great service if you could persuade our country statesmen that they would be better employed at their rustic occupations than in mana∣ging the affairs of the nation and that many a man would make a scurvy figure at the helm of the state who is of great use at the ploughtail As to my friend Sir  Politic  I should be very glad if he would leave the conduct of the war and the destination of our fleets and armies to the mi∣nistry who will I doubt not adjust matters as prudently as himself the curate and apothecary and I think his thoughts might be more properly exercised in contriving some method of redeeming two heavy mortgages that in∣cumber his estate than in laying plans for the discharge of the national debt  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXVII THURSDAY  July    Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes  HOR  To Mr TOWN  July    SIR  I  READ your late paper shewing the close analogy which cloathing the body bears to adorning the mind with great attention and am thoroughly persuaded that the generality of mankind would be as glad to embellish their minds as to set off their persons if they could procure knowledge virtue and goodnature with the same ease that they can furnish themselves with the ornaments of the body The clown in rug or duffel can at a moment's warning be furnished with a complete suit of lace or embroidery  from  Monmouthstreet  his long lank greasy hair may be exchanged in  Middle Row  for a smart bag or a jemmy scratch and his clouted shoes with the rough hobnails in the heel and sole clumping at every step may be transformed into a pair of dancing pumps at the  Yorkshire  Warehouse or the  Old Crispin  in  Cranbourn Alley  The draggled street walker can rig herself with a clean smock a linen gown and a hat smartly cocked up behind and before in  Broad St Giles  's or if she can afford it every pawnbroker will let out a gold watch with coronets a tissue or brocaded sack and all the  paraphernalia  of a countess But where Mr TOWN can these people go to cloath their minds or at what shops are retailed sense and virtue Honour and honesty are not to be purchased in  Monmouthstreet  Know∣ledge is not infused into the head through the powderpuff and as good wine needs no bush sense is not derived from the fullbottomed periwig The woman of the town vamped up for show with paint patches plumpers and every external ornament that art can suggest knows no me∣thod to beautify her mind She cannot for any price buy chastity in  Broad St Giles  's or hire honesty from the pawn∣broker's  SEEING therefore at one view the difficulty in obtaining the accomplishments of the mind and the exact analogy they bear to dress I have been labouring this week past to remedy that inconvenience and have at length devised a scheme which will fully answer that purpose In a word then I shall next winter open a shop or warehouse in the most public part of the town under the name of a MINDAND BODYCLOTHIER two trades which though never yet united are so far from being incompatible that they are in  their nature inseparable I shall not only supply my friends with a suit or a single virtue but furnish them with com∣plete habits of mind and body from head to foot and by a certain secret art in the form and texture of the things sold the required virtues shall be as inherent in them as the materials of which they are composed That such virtues may be transfused by cloaths is evident from experience In the narrow extent of my reading Mr TOWN I remem∣ber to have met with an account of  Fortunatus  's  WishingCap  by which he could transport himself in an instant from one place to another It is also well known that the famous  Jack  the Giantkiller possessed a sword of sharpness shoes of swiftness and a coat of invisibility Why then may not I sell a suit of patriotism a sword of honour and retail modesty and chastity to fine ladies in tuckers and aprons My scheme is already in great forwardness and I shall be able to accommodate my customers by the next birthday wherefore as Messieurs  Paris  and others daily advertise in the newspapers I also chuse to give the world public notice of my scheme and shall be proud to see them first apprised of it by means of your paper  NO one who duly considers the natural influence which cloaths commonly have upon their wearers will object to my scheme as utterly impracticable That a person can put on or throw off the internal habits of his mind together with his coat or his perriwig is plain in very numerous instances The young counsellor who every morning in term time takes the measure of  WestminsterHall  with the importance of a judge upon the circuit at once divests himself of his gravity with the starched band and long robe and resumes the spirit of a buck together with the  sword and bagwig In the same manner the orthodox vicar once a week wraps himself up in piety and virtue with his canonicals which qualities are as easily cast off again as his surplice and for the rest of the week he wears the dress as well as the manners of his foxhunting patron We may learn the disposition of a man by his apparel as we know the trade of a carpenter by his leathern apron or a soldier by his red coat When we see a snuffcoloured suit of  ditto  with the bolus buttons a metal headed cane and an enormous bushy grizzle we as readily know the wearer to be a dispenser of life and death as if we had seen him pounding a mortar or brandishing a clysterpipe The different affections of the mind have been distinguished by different colours as scarlet has been made to represent valour yellow to denote jealousy and true blue to signify integrity but we may likewise discover all the virtues and vices lurking in the different parts of the apparel When at a city feast I see the guests tucking their napkins into their shirtcollars as if they were all of them going to be shaved I very well know that their thoughts wear a different dress than in the Alley and when the antiquated toast is laying on her complexion at the toilette and repairing the ruins of beauty what is she doing but patching her mind with pride and conceit In a word I can discover impudence staring from the bold cock of a  Kevenhuller  frugality skulk∣ing in a darned stocking coquetry spread out in a hoop∣petticoat and soppery dangling from a shoulderknot I often please myself with thus remarking the various dresses of the mind and by the clue you have already given us I have been able to unfold the inmost linings of the heart and discover  "the very stuff of the thoughts"  IT must however be owned that in these matters the nicest penetration may be imposed on since in the present random method of dressing many persons appear in mas∣querade This inconvenience among many others will be remedied by my project for as whoever deals with me will at once cloath his mind and his body the whole town will be dressed in character Thus if a chimneysweeper or a ploughboy put on a suit of embroidery a sword bagwig c they will at the same time invest themselves with the inter∣nal dignity of a person of quality my lady's youngest son may buy courage with his regimentals and orthodoxy may be purchased at the same time with a gown and cassock by the young smarts from the universities My scheme also further recommends itself by laying open the only path to virtue and knowledge that the world will chuse to follow and as my cloaths will always be cut according to the newest and most elegant manner these qualifications of the mind inherent in them must necessarily come into fashion Thus our fine gentlemen will learn morality under their valet de chambre and a young lady of fashion will acquire new ac∣complishments with every new ribband and become virtu∣ous as well as beautiful at her toilette I depend on your readiness to promote my scheme but what I most earnestly intreat of you Mr TOWN is to use your utmost interest with the polite world but especially with the ladies not to discard cloaths entirely as by such a resolution my scheme must be defeated and indeed it will not be in the power of man to give them virtue if they determine to go naked  AS knowledge and virtue can never be sufficiently dif∣fused my warehouse will be calculated for general use and stored with large assortments of all kinds of virtues and dresses that I may suit persons of whatever denomination Physicians may be furnished from my shop with gravity and learning in the tyes of a perriwig serjeants at law may be fitted with a competent knowledge of reports under a coif  and young counsellors may be endued with a sufficient fund of eloquence for the circuits in a smart tye between a bob and a flow contrived to cover a toupee I shall sell religion to country parsons in puddingsleeves and to young town curates just come from the university in doctors scarfs and cut grizzles I shall have some pious ejaculations whi∣nings and groans ready cut out in leathern aprons and blue frocks for the preaching fraternity of carpenters brick∣layers tallowchandlers and butchers at the Tabernacle and Foundery in  Moorfields  For our military gentlemen de∣signed to go abroad I shall have several parcels of true  Bri∣tish  courage woven in a variety of cockades and swordknots and for our fine gentlemen who stay at home I have pro∣vided a proper quantity of  French Bagatelle  in cut velvet lace and embroidery neat as imported  AS the ladies I suppose will all of them to a woman be desirous of purchasing beauty with every branch of the fe∣male apparel I am afraid I shall not be able to answer their demands but I shall have several dresses which will make up for the want of it I shall have neatness done up in a great variety of plain linnen decency and discretion in several patterns for mobs hoods and nightgowns together with modesty disposed into tuckers kerchiefs for the neck stays that almost meet the chin and petticoats that touch the ground I shall also have a small portion of chastity knit into garters and laces for the stays very proper to be worn at masquerades and assemblies  I HAD almost forgot to mention that authors who are often in equal want of sense and cloaths shall be fitted out by me with both at once on very reasonable rates As for yourself Mr TOWN I shall beg leave to present you with an entire suit of superfine wit and humour warranted to wear well and appear creditable and in which no author would be ashamed to be seen  I am Sir your humble servant EUTRAPELUS TRIM  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXVIII THURSDAY  July    A very uncommon though just vein of thought runs through the following letter I shall add nothing more in recommendation of it but only assure my correspon∣dent that I shall be very glad to hear from him again  Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  N  OTHING appears to me to be more neces∣sary in order to wear off any particularities in our behaviour or to root out any per∣verseness in our opinions than mixing with persons of ages and occupations different from our own Whosoever confines himself entirely to the society of those who are engaged in the same persuits  and whose thoughts naturally take the same turn with his own acquires a certain stiffness and pedantry of behaviour which is sure to make him disagreeable except in one particular set of company Instead of cramping the mind by keeping it within so narrow a circle we should endeavour to enlarge it by every worthy notion and accomplishment and temper each qualification with its opposite as the four elements are compounded in our natural frame  THE necessity of this free conversation to open and im∣prove the mind is evident from the consequences which always follow a neglect of it The employment each man follows wholly engrosses his attention and tinges the mind with a peculiar die which shews itself in all the operations of it unless prevented by natural good sense and liberal education The physician the lawyer and the tradesman will appear in company though none of those occupations are the subject of discourse and the clergyman will grow morose and severe who seldom or never converses with the laity But if no particular profession has this influence over us some darling passion or amusement gives a colour to our thoughts and actions and makes us odious or at least ridiculous Fine ladies for instance by despising the con∣versation of sensible men can talk of nothing but routes balls assemblies birthday suits and intrigues and fine gentlemen for the same reason of almost nothing at all In like manner the furious partizan who has not been weaned from a mad attachment to particular principles is weak enough to imagine every man of a different way of thinking a fool and a scoundrel and the sectary or zealot devotes to eternal damnation all those who will not go to heaven in the same road with himself under the guidance  of  Whitefield Wesley  or  Count Zinzendorff  To the same cause we owe the rough country squire whose ideas are wholly bent on guns dogs horses and game and who has every thing about him of a piece with his diversions His hall must be adorned with stags heads instead of busts and statues and in the room of family pictures you will see prints of the most famous stallions and racehorses all his doors open and shut with foxes feet and even the buttons of his cloaths are impressed with the figures of dogs foxes stags and horses To this absurd practice of culti∣vating only one set of ideas and shutting ourselves out from any intercourse with the rest of the world is owing that narrowness of mind which has infected the conversations of the polite world with insipidity made roughness and bruta∣lity the characteristics of a mere country gentleman and pro∣duced the most fatal consequences in politics and religion  BUT if this commerce with the generality of mankind is so necessary to remove any impressions which we may be liable to receive from any particular employment or darling amusement what precautions ought to be used in order to remedy the inconveniences naturally brought on us by the different ages of life It is not certain that a person will be engaged in any profession or given up to any peculiar kind of pleasure but the mind of every man is subject to the inclinations arising from the several stages of his existence as well as his body to chronical distempers This indeed Mr TOWN is the principal cause of my writing to you for it has often given me great concern to see the present division between the young and the old to observe elderly men forming themselves into clubs and societies that they may be more securely separated from youth and to see  young men running into dissipation and debauchery rather than associate with age If each party would labour to conform to the other from such a coalition many advanta∣ges would accrue to both Our youth would be instructed by the experience of age and lose much of that severity which they retain too long while at the same time the wrinkled brow of the aged would be smoothed by the sprightly chearfulness of youth by which they might supply the want of spirits forget the loss of old friends and bear with ease all their worldly misfortunes It is re∣markable that those young men are the most worthy and sensible who have kept up any intercourse with the old and that those old men are of the most chearful and amiable disposition who have not been ashamed to con∣verse with the young  I WILL not pretend to decide which party is most blame∣able in neglecting this necessary commerce between each other which if properly managed would be at once so beneficial and delightful but it undoubtedly arises from a certain selfishness and obstinacy in both which will not suffer them to make a mutual allowance for the natural difference of their dispositions Their inclinations are indeed as diffe∣rent as their years yet each expects the other to comply though neither will make any advances How rarely do we see the least degree of society preserved between a father and son a shocking reflection when we consider that na∣ture has endeavoured to unite them by parental affection on one side and filial gratitude on the other Yet a father and son as seldom live together with any tolerable harmony as a husband and wife and chiefly for the same reason for though they are both joined under the same yoke yet they  are each tugging different ways A father might as well expect his son to be as gouty and infirm as himself as to have the disposition which he has contracted from age and a son might as reasonably desire the vigour and vivacity of five and twenty as his own love of gaiety and diversions in his father It is therefore plainly evident that a mutual endeavour of conforming to each other is absolutely requi∣site to keep together the cement of natural affection which the want of it so frequently dissolves or at at least if it does not disturb the affection it constantly destroys the society between father and son  THIS unhappy and unnatural division is often the subject of complaint in persons of both ages but is still unremedied because they neither reflect on the cause whence it proceeds Old men are perpetually commenting on the extreme levity of the times and blaming the young because they do not admire and court their company which indeed is no wonder since they generally treat their youthful companions as mere children and expect such a slavish deference to their years as destoys that equality by which chearfulness and society subsists Young men do not like to be chid by an illnatur'd proverb or reproved by a wrinkle but though they do not chuse to be corrected by their grave seniors like schoolboys they would be proud to consult them as friends which the injudicious severity of old age seldom will permit not deigning to indulge them with so great a degree of freedom and familiarity Youth on the other hand shun the company of age complaining of the small regard and respect paid to them though they often act with so little reserve and such unbecoming confidence as not to deserve it Suppose the old were pleased with the natu∣ral  flow of spirits and lively conversation of youth still some respect may be challenged as due to them nor should the decency and sobriety of their characters ever be insulted by any improper or immodest conversation  I AM an old man myself Mr TOWN and I have an only boy whose behaviour to me is unexceptionable per∣mit me therefore to dwell a moment longer on my favourite subject and I will conclude With what harmony might all parents and children live together if the father would strive to soften the rigour of age and remember that his son must naturally possess those qualities which ever ac∣company youth and if the son would in return endeavour to suit himself to those infirmities which his Father received from old age If they would reciprocally study to be agree∣able to each other the father would insensibly substitute affection in the room of authority and lose the churlish severity and peevishness incident to his years while the son would curb the unbecoming impetuosity of his youth change his reluctance to obey into a constant attention to please and remit much of his extreme gaiety in conformity to the gra∣vity of his father Wherever such a turn of mind is en∣couraged there must be happiness and agreeable society and the contrary qualities of youth and age thus com∣pounded compose the surest cement of affection as colours of the most opposite tints by a skilful mixture each giving and receiving certain shades will form a picture the most heightened and exquisite in it's colouring  I am Sir Your most humble Servant JOHN BEVILL  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXIX THURSDAY  July    O te Bollane cerebri  Felicem aiebam tacitus dum quidlibet ille  Garriret vicos urbem laudaret  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  HAVE been very much diverted with your observations on our honest tradesmen who make weekly excursions into the neigh∣bouring villages and I agree with you that the generality of our citizens seldom dare trust themselves out of the sight of  London  smoke or extend their travels further than with their wives and chil∣dren in the  Wandsworth  double postchaise or the  Hampton  long coach But we may now and then pick up a stray citizen whom business has dragged beyond the bills of  mortality as it happened to myself the other day about twenty miles from  London  and as I was mightily pleased with his behaviour and conversation I have taken the liberty to send you an account of it  BEING caught in a shower upon the road I was glad to take shelter at the first inn I came to which if it had been called the NEW INN I should have thought from its antique appearance that it had been an house of entertain∣ment in the time of our great grandfathers I had scarce alighted when a strange figure driven thither as I supposed on the same account with myself came soberly jogging into the yard dripping wet As he waited for the steps before he would venture to get off his horse I had the opportu∣nity of surveying his whole appearance He was wrapped up in an old threadbare weatherbeaten surtout which I believe had once been scarlet the cape was pulled over his head and buttoned up close round his face and his hat was flapped down on each side and fastened about his ears with a list garter tyed under his chin He wore upon his legs something that resembled splatterdashes which as I afterwards learned were cut out of an old pair of boots but his right shoe was considerably larger than the other and had several slits in the upper leather He had spurs on indeed but without rowels and by way of whip a wormeaten cane with a bone head studded with brass pins hung from his wrist by a string of greasy black leather  I SOON found I was nobody for the GENTLEMAN it seems took up the whole attention of the maid mistress and ostler who all of them got round him and with much difficulty by the assistance of the steps helped him down  My landlady after the usual welcome before it was pos∣sible for her to see any part of him but his nose told him  "he looked brave and jolly"  and when she had led him into the kitchen she fetched a large glass of what she called  "her own water"  which she said would keep the cold out of his stomach All hands were now busied in drawing off his surtout which discovered underneath a fulltrimmed white coat and a black velvet waistcoat with a broad gold lace very much tarnished The surtout was hung to dry by the fire as well as his coat the place of which was sup∣plied by a long ridinghood of my landlady and as the gentleman complained of having suffered by a loss of leather the maid was dispatched to the doctor's for some  diachylon  The usual question now succeeded concern∣ing dinner and as he observed I was all alone he very courteously offered me to join company which I as rea∣dily accepted  THE important business of dinner being settled we ad∣journed into a private room when my fellowguest told me of his own accord that he lived in  London  that for these twenty years he had always come to the town we were now in once a year to receive money and take orders for goods and that he had always put up at this house He then run on in the praises of the landlady and tipping me a wink  "ay says he she has been a clever woman in her time before she bore children"  He added that for his part he did not like your great inns for that they never looked upon any thing under a coach and six He fur∣ther informed me that he was married to his present wife in the first mayoralty of Alderman  Parsons  and in the very waistcoat he had on  "but says he I now wear it only  on a journey because you know a bit of lace com∣mands respect upon the road"  Upon enquiring about his family I found he had three boys one of whom was bound prentice to himself the other was sent to sea be∣cause he was a wild one and the third he designed to make a parson of because he was grave and his playfellows at  Poule  's school used to call him  "bishop"  ALL this while he had sat in my landlady's ridinghood with a linen nightcap on his head tyed on the top with a piece of black ribband which he told me he always rode in because it was cooler than a wig But the saddlebags were now ordered in and out of one of them he drew a large flowing grizzle carefully buckled which he combed out himself borrowing some flour from the kitchen drudger His splatterdashes were next taken off his shoes wiped with a wisp of hay and being assured by the landlady herself that his coat was dry enough to put on he completely equipped himself in order to wait on several tradesmen with whom he had dealings after dinner As this was not quite ready we took a walk to the stables to see his mare and though the beast seemed as lean and harmless as  Sancho  's ass he assured me he had much ado to ride her she was so frisky  "for she had not run in the chaise these two sundays past"  BEING summoned in to dinner we sat down to a repast of mutton chops and sheeps hearts which last he declared to be the wholsomest eating in the world He objected to wine because there was not a drop good for any thing to be got upon the road but he vastly recommended my landlady's homebrewed which he affirmed to be better  than  Hogsden  ale or the thatch beer at  Islington  Our meal being ended my companion took his pipe and we laid our heads together for the good of the nation when we mauled the  French  terribly both by land and sea At last among other talk he happened to ask me if I lived in the City As I was desirous of hearing his remarks I answered that I had never seen  London  "Never seen it says he Then you have never seen one of the finest sights in the whole world  Paris  is but a doghole to it"  There luckily hung a large Map of  London  over the chimneypiece which he immediately made me get from my chair to look at  "There says he there's  London  for youYou see it is bigger than the Map of all  England  He then led me about with the end of his pipe through all the principal streets from  HydePark  to  WhiteChapel    "That says he is the River  Thames  There's  London  BridgeThere my Lord Mayor livesThat's  Poule  'sThere the  Mo∣nument  stands And now if you was but on the top of it you might see all the houses and churches in  London  "  I expressed my astonishment at every particular but I could hardly refrain laughing when pointing out to me  Lincoln's Inn Fields    "There said he there all the noblemen live"  At last after having transported me all over the town he set me down in  Cheapside  "which he said was the big∣gest street in the City"  "And now says he I'll show you where I live  "That's  BowChurch  and there∣aboutswhere my pipe istherejust there my shop stands"  He concluded with a kind invitation to me to come and see him and pulling out a book of patterns from his coatpocket assured me that if I wanted any thing in his way he could afford to let me have a bargain  I PROMISED to call upon him and the weather now clearing up after settling the ballance of our reckoning with the landlady we took leave of each other but just as I had mounted my horse and was going to set forward my new acquaintance came up to me and shaking me by the hand  "Hearkye says he if you will be in town by the twenty fifth of this instant  July  I will intro∣duce you to the  Cockney's Feast  where I assure you you'll be mighty merry and hear a great many good songs"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXX THURSDAY  August    Nulla viri cura intereà nec mentio fiet  Damnorum  JUV  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  F polygamy was allowed in this country I am sure I might maintain a seraglio of wives at less expence than I have brought upon myself by marrying one woman One did I say Alas I find it to my cost that a wife like a polypus has the power of dividing and multi∣plying herself into as many bodies as she pleases You must know Mr TOWN I took a woman of small fortune and made her my own flesh and blood but I never thought that all her relations would likewise fasten on me with as little ceremony as a colony of fleas I had scarce brought  her home before I was obliged to marry her mother then I was prevailed on to marry her two maiden sisters after that I married her aunts then her cousinsIn short I am now married to the whole generation of them I do not exaggerate matters when I say that I am married to them all for they claim as much right to every thing that is mine as the person whom the world calls my wife They eat drink and sleep with me Every room in my house is at their command except my bedchamber They bor∣row money of meand since I have the whole family quartered upon me what signifies which of them takes upon her my namemy wife her sister or her twen∣tieth cousin  O Mr TOWN I never sit down to table without the lamentable prospect of seeing as much victuals consumed as would dine a whole vestry So many mouths constantly going at my expence And then there is such variety of provi∣sions for cousin  Biddy  likes one dish my aunt  Rachel  is fond of another sister  Molly  cannot abide this and mother could never touch thatthough I find they are all of them unanimous in liking the best of every thing in season Besides I could entertain a set of jolly topers at a less rate than it costs me in light wines for the women One of them drinks nothing but  Lisbon  with another nothing goes down but  Rhenish  and  Spa  a third swallows me an ocean of  Bristol Milk  with as little remorse as she would so much small beer my eldest aunt likes a glass of dry  Mountain  while the other thinks nothing helps digestion so well as  Madeira  'Twas but the other day that my wife expressed a desire of tasting some  Claret  when im∣mediately all my goodnatured relations had a mighty  longing for it but with much ado I at last prevailed on them to compound with me for a chest of  Florence  YOU may imagine that my house cannot be a very small one and I assure you there are as many beds in it as in a country inn Yet I have scarce room to turn myself about in it for one apartment is taken up by this relation another by that and the most distant cousin must have more respect shewn her than to be clapped up in a garret with the maidservants so that poor I have no more liberty in my own house than a lodger Once indeed I in vain endeavoured to shake them off and took a little box in the neighbourhood of town scarce big enough to hold my own family But alas they stuck as close to it as a snail to her shell and rather than not lie under the same roof with their relation they contrived to litter together like so many pigs in a stye At another time thinking to clear my house at once of these vermin I packed up my wife and mother and sent them to her uncle's in the country for a month But what could I do there was no getting rid of those left behind my wife had made over to them the care of the household allotting to each of them her particular employment during her absence One was to pickle walnuts another to preserve sweetmeats another to make Morella brandy all which they executed with the notableness peculiar to good housewives who spoil and waste more than they save for the satisfaction of making these things at home At last my wife returned and all that I got by her journey was the importation of two new cousins fresh out of the country who she never knew before were the least related to herbut they have been so kind as to claim kindred with me by hanging upon me ever since  ONE would imagine that it were sufficient for these loving relations to have the run of my table and to make my house in every respect their own but not content with this they have the cunning to oblige me in a manner to find them in cloaths likewise I should not repine if any of my worthy relations were humble enough to put up with a castoff suit of my wife's but that would be robbing the maid of her just dues and would look more like a dependant than a relation Not but that they will con∣descend now and then to take a gown before it is half worn out when they have talked my wife into a dislike of itbecause it is too good for a common servant They have more spirit than to  beg  any thing butif my wife has a fancy to  part  with itthey will wear it purely for her sake A cap an apron or an handkerchief which looks hideous upon her I always find is very becoming on any other of the family and I remember soon after we were married happening to find fault with the pattern of a silk brocade my wife had just bought one of her sisters took it from her and told me she would have it made up for herself and wear it on purpose to spite me  YOU must know Mr TOWN that upon my marriage I was indiscreet enough to set up my chariot and since my family has increased so prodigiously this has given them a handle to have a coach likewise and another pair of horses for them to take an airing in This also furnishes them with a pretence for running about to public diversions where I am forced to treat them all for they are so very fond of each others company that one will hardly ever stir out without the other Thus at home or abroad they con∣stantly herd together and what is still more provoking  though I had rather have a route every week at my house my wife makes a merit of it that she keeps little or no company  SUCH is the state of my family within doors and though you would think this sufficient for one man I can assure you that I have other calls on me from relations no less dear to me though I have never yet had the happiness to see them A third cousin by my wife's father's side was set up in the country in a very good way of business but by mis∣fortunes in trade must have gone to jail if my wife had not teized me into being bound for him and for which I was soon after arrested and obliged to pay the money Ano∣ther a very promising youth was just out of his time and only wanted a little sum to set him up which as soon as I had lent him he run away and is gone to sea One of the aunts who is now with me a widow lady has an only daughter a sober discreet body who lived as a com∣panion with an old gentlewoman in the country but the poor innocent girl being drawn aside by a vile fellow that ruined her I have been forced to support the unhappy mother and child ever since to prevent any reproach falling on our family I shall say nothing of the various presents which have travelled down to my wife's uncle in return for one turkey and chine received at  Christmas  nor shall I put to account the charge I have been at in the gossips fees and in buying corals c for half a dozen little ne∣phews neices and cousins to which I had the honour of standing godfather  AND now Mr TOWN the mention of this last circum∣stance makes me reflect with an heavy heart on a new ca∣lamity  which will shortly befal me My wife you must know is very near her time and they have provided as great a store of caps clouts biggens bellybands whittles and all kinds of childbedlinnen as would set up a Lyingin Hospital You will conclude that my family wants no fur∣ther increase Yet would you believe it I have just re∣ceived a letter that another aunt and another cousin are coming up in the stage coach to see their relation and are resolved to stay with her the month Indeed I am afraid when they have once got footing in my house they will resolve to stay with her till she has another and another child  I am sir Your humble servant c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXI THURSDAY  August    Genus humanum multò fuit illud in arvis  Durius  JUV  Mr VILLAGE to Mr TOWN  DEAR COUSIN  A  MERE Country Squire who passes all his time among dogs and horses is now become an uncommon character and the most aukward loobily inheritor of an old mansionhouse is a fine gentleman in comparison to his forefathers The principles of a town education for∣merly scarce spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the bills of mortality but now every  London  refinement travels to the remotest corner of the kingdom and the polite families from the town duly import to their distant seats the customs and manners of  Pallmall  and  GrosvenorSquare  I HAVE been for this fortnight past at Lord  Courtley  's who for about four months in every year leads a town life at the distance of above two hundred miles from  London  He never rises till twelve or one o'clock though indeed he often sees the sun rise but then that only happens when as the old song says he has  "drank down the moon"  Drinking is the only rural amusement he persues but even that part of his diversions is conducted entirely in the  Lon∣don  fashion He does not swill country ale but gets drunk with Champagne and Burgundy and every dish at his table is served up with as much elegance as at  White  's or  Ryan  's He has an excellent pack of hounds but I believe was never in at the death of a fox in his life yet strangers never want a chace for the hounds are out three times a week with a younger brother of Lord  Courtley  's who never saw  London  in his life and who if he was not indulged with a place at his lordship's table might naturally be considered as his whipperin or his gamekeeper  THE eveningwalk is a thing unknown and unheard of at Lord  Courtley  's for though situated in a very fine country he knows no more of the charms of purling streams and shady groves than if they never existed but in poetry or romance As soon as the daily debauch after dinner and the ceremonies of coffee and tea are over the company is conducted into a magnificent apartment illuminated with waxcandles and set but with as many cardtables as the route of a foreign ambassador's lady Here Faro Whist Brag Lansquenet and every other fashionable game make up the evening's entertainment This piece of politeness has sometimes fallen heavy on some honest country gentlemen who have found dining with his lordship turn out a very dear ordinary and many a good lady has had occasion to  curse the cards and her illstarred connections with per∣sons of quality though his lordship is never at a loss for a party for as several people of fashion have seats near him he often sits down with some of his friends of the club at  White  's I had almost forgot to mention that her ladyship  keeps a day  which is Sunday  THIS Dear Cousin is the genteel manner of living in the country and I cannot help observing that persons polite enough to be fond of such exquisite refinements are partly in the same case with the mechanic at his dusty villa They both indeed change their situation but neither find the least alteration in their ideas The tradesman when at his box has all the notions that employ him in his comptinghouse and the nobleman though in the far∣thest part of  England  may still be said to breath the air of St  James  's  I WAS chiefly induced to send you this short account of the refined manner in which persons of fashion pass their time at Lord  Courtley  's because I think it a very striking contrast to the character described in the inclosed paper I hope your readers will not do either you or me the honour to think this natural description a mere creature of the ima∣gination The picture of the extraordinary gentleman here described is now at the seat of Lord  Shaftsbury  at St  Giles  's near  Cranborn  in  Dorsetshire  and this lively character of him was really and truly drawn by  Anthony Ashly Cowper  first Earl of  Shaftsbury  and is inscribed on the picture I doubt not but you will be glad of being able to communicate it to the public and that they will receive it with their usual candour  I am dear Cousin yours c  The Character of the Honourable W HASTINGS of  Woodlands  in  Hampshire  Second Son of FRANCIS Earl of  Huntingdon  IN the Year lived Mr  Hastings  by his Quality Son Brother and Uncle to the Earls of  Huntingdon  He was peradventure an original in our Age or rather the Copy of our ancient Nobility in hunting not in warlike times  He was low very strong and very active of a reddish flaxen Hair His Cloaths always green Cloth and never all worth when new five Pounds  His House was perfectly of the old Fashion in the midst of a large Park well stocked with Deer and near the House Rabits to serve his Kitchen many Fishponds great store of Wood and Timber a Bowling Green in it long but narrow full of high Ridges it being never levell'd since it was plough'd They used round Sand Bowls and it had a Banquetting House like a Stand built in a Tree  He kept all Manner of Sport Hounds that ran Buck Fox Hare Otter and Badger And Hawks long and short winged He had all Sorts of Nets for Fish He had a Walk in the  New Forest  and the Manor of  ChristChurch  This last supply'd him with Red Deer Sea and River Fish And indeed all his Neighbours Grounds and Royalties were free to him who bestow'd all his Time on these Sports but what he borrow'd to caress his Neighbours Wives and Daughters there being not a Woman in all his Walks of the Degree of a Yeoman's Wife or under and under the Age of forty but it was extremely her Fault if he was not intimately acquainted with her This made him very po∣pular always speaking kindly to the Husband Brother or Father who was to boat very welcome to his House whenever he came There he found Beef Pudding and  small Beer in great plenty A House not so neatly kept as to shame  Him  or his dirty shoes the great Hall strow'd with Marrowbones full of HawksPerches Hounds Spaniels and Terriers the upper Side of the Hall hung with Foxskins of this and the last Year's kiiling here and there a PoleCat intermixt Gamekeepers and Hunter's Poles in great Abundance  The Parlour was a large Room as properly furnished On a great Hearth paved with Brick lay some Terriers and the choicest Hounds and Spaniels Seldom but two of the great Chairs had litters of young Cats in them which were not to be disturbed he having always three or four attend∣ing him at Dinner and a little white round Stick of fourteen Inches lying by his Trencher that he might defend such Meat as he had no mind to part with to them The Win∣dows which were very large served for Places to lay his Arrows CrossBows StoneBows and other such like Ac∣coutrements The Corners of the Room full of the bestchose Hunting and Hawking Poles An Oyster Table at the lower End which was of constant Use twice a Day all the Year round For he never failed to eat Oysters before Dinner and Supper through all Seasons the neighb'ring Town of  Pool  supply'd him with them  The upper part of the Room had two small Tables and a Desk on the one side of which was a Church Bible and on the other the Book of Martyrs On the Table were HawksHoods Bells and such like two or three old green Hats with their Crowns thrust in so as to hold ten or a dozen Eggs which were of a Pheasant kind of Poultry he took much care of and fed himself Tables Dice Cards and Boxes were not wanting In the Hole of the Desk were store of Tobacco Pipes that had been used  On one Side of this End of the Room was the Door of a Closet wherein stood the Strong Beer and the Wine which never came thence but in single Glasses that being the Rule of the House exactly observ'd For he never exceeded in Drink or permitted it  On the other Side was the Door into an old Chapel not used for Devotion The Pulpit as the safest Place was never wanting of a cold Chine of Beef Venison Pasty Gammon of Bacon or great Applepye with thick Crust extremely baked  His Table cost him not much though it was good to eat at His Sports supplied all but Beef and Mutton except Fridays when he had the best Saltfish as well as other Fish he could get and was the Day his Neighbours of best Quality most visited him He never wanted a  London  Pudding and always sung it in with  My Part lies thereina  He drank a Glass or two of Wine at Meals very often Sy∣rup of Gillyflower in his Sack and had always a Tun Glass without Feet stood by him holding a Pint of SmallBeer which he often stirr'd with Rosemary  He was well natured but soon angry calling his Servants Bastards and cuckoldy Knaves in one of which he often spoke Truth to his own Knowledge and sometimes in both though of the same Man He lived to

By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXII THURSDAY  August    Nosse omnia haec salus est adolescentulis  TER  T  HOUGH the following letter was origi∣nally written for the instruction of a Young Gentleman going to the University yet as it contains several just and sensible reflections which may be of use to many of my rea∣ders I have willingly complied with the request of my correspondent in making it the entertainment of today  DEAR SIR  AS you are now going to the University I would not be thought to pay so ill a compliment to your own natural good sense as to suppose that you will not like many young gentlemen of fortune in some measure apply yourself to study otherwise the time you spend there  will be entirely lost for as the SPECTATOR very justly remarks  "all ornamental parts of education are better taught in other places"  At the same time I do not mean that you should commence Pedant and be continu∣ally poring on a book since that will rather puzzle than inform the understanding Though I know many sprightly young gentlemen of lively and quick parts affect to despise it altogether it will be necessary to learn something of Lo∣gic I mean in the same manner one would learn Fencingnot to attack others but to defend one's self In a word you will find it a great unhappiness when you return hither if you do not bring with you some taste for reading for a mere Country Gentleman who can find no society in books will have little else to do besides following his sports but to sit as squire of the company tippling among a parcel of idle wretches whose understandings are nearly on a level with his dogs and horses  IT has been an established maxim that the world will always form an opinion of persons according to the company they are known to keep In the University as well as in other places there are people whom we ought to avoid as we would the plague and as it is of the utmost conse∣quence whether you plunge at once into extravagance and debauchery or sink gradually into indolence and stupidity I shall point out some of these pests of society in as few words as possible  THE first person I would caution you against is the wretch that takes a delight to turn religion into ridicule one that employs that speech which was given him by God to celebrate his praise in questioning his very being This as it is impious in itself is likewise the height of  illmanners It is hoped there are but few of them to be met with in a place of sound doctrine and religious education but wherever they are they ought as much as possible to be avoided and if they will force themselves into our com∣pany they should be used with the same contempt with which they have the hardiness to treat their Maker And this I can assure you may be done safely for I never knew any body who pretended to be above the fear of God but was under the most terrible apprehensions whenever attacked by man  THE next character whom I would advise you to shun is the GAMESTER in some respects not unlike the former The gamingtable is his shrine and fortune his deity nor does he ever speak or think of any other unless by way of blasphemy oaths and curses when he has had a bad run at cards or dice He has not the least notion of friend∣ship but would ruin his own brother if it might be of any advantage to himself He indeed professes himself your friend but that is only with a design to draw you in for his trade is inconsistent with the principles of honour or justice without which there can be no real friendship It should therefore be the care of every gentleman not to hold any commerce with such people whose acquaintance he cannot enjoy without giving up his estate  THE next person whom you ought to beware of is a DRUNKARD one that takes an unaccountable pleasure in sapping his constitution and drowning his understanding He constantly goes senseless to bed and rises maukish in the morning nor can he be easy in body or mind 'till he has renewed his dose and again put himself beyond the reach of reflection I would therefore entreat you by all  means to avoid an habit which will at once ruin your health and impair your intellects It is a misfortune that society should be esteemed dull and insipid without the assistance of the bottle to enliven it so that a man cannot entirely refrain from his glass if he keeps any company at all But let it be remembered that in drinking as well as in talking we ought always to keep a  "watch over the doors of our lips"  A LOWNGER is a creature that you will often see lolling in a coffeehouse or sauntering about the streets with great calmness and a most inflexible stupidity in his coun∣tenance He takes as much pains as the Sot to fly from his own thoughts and is at length happily arrived at the highest pitch of indolence both in mind and body He would be as inoffensive as he is dull if it were not that his idleness is contagious for like the  torpedo  he is sure to benumb and take away all sense of feeling from every one with whom he happens to come in contact  IT were also best to forbear the company of a WRANG∣LER or a person of a litigious temper This sometimes arises not from any great share of illnature but from a vain pride of showing one's parts or skill in argumentation It is frequently observed of young Academics in particular that they are very apt impertinently to engage people in a dispute whether they will or not But this is contrary to all the rules of goodbreeding and is never practised by any man of sense that has seen much of the world I have some∣times known a person of great sauciness and volubility of expression confuted by the  Argumentum Baculinum  and both his head and his syllogism broken at the same time  I NEED not point out to you the profligate RAKE or the affected COXCOMB as persons from whose company you can reap no sort of benefit From the first the good principles already instilled into you will doubtless preserve you and I am sure you have too much real sense not to despise the absurd fopperies of the latter Noted LYARS are no less to be avoided as the common pests of society They are often of a mischievous disposition and by their calumnies and false suggestions take a pleasure in setting the most intimate friends at variance But if they only deal in harmless and improbable lies their acquaintance must fre∣quently be out of countenance for them and if we should venture to repeat after them I am sure it is the way to be out of countenance for ourselves  BUT above all I must advise you never to engage at least not with any degree of violence in any PARTY Be not transported by the clamorous jollity of talking patriots be∣yond the sober dictates of reason and justice nor let the insinuating voice of corruption tempt you to barter your integrity and peace of mind for the paultry satisfaction of improving your fortune If you behave with honour and prudence you will be regarded and courted by all parties but if otherwise you will certainly be despised by all Per∣haps indeed if you should hereafter engage in elections and spend your own money to support another's cause the person in whose interest you are may shake you by the hand and swear you are a very honest gentlemanjust as butchers treat their bulldogs who spit in their mouths clap them on the back and then halloo them on to be tossed and torn by the horns of their antagonist  AFTER having guarded you against the evil influence of your own sex I cannot conclude without throwing in a  word or two concerning the Ladies But that I may not be thought unmannerly to the fair I shall pass over their faults only hoping that their excellencies will not tempt you to precipitate a match with one much your inferior in birth and fortune though  "endowed with every accom∣plishment requisite to make the marriage state happy"  In these hasty and unequal matches it sometimes happens that mutual love gives way to mutual reproaches We may per∣haps too late repent of our bargain and though Repentance be an excellent visiting friend when she reminds us of our past miscarriages and prescribes rules how to avoid them for the future yet she is a most troublesome companion when fixed upon us for life  I am dear sir your sincere friend c H A  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXIII THURSDAY  August    Me LITERULAS stulti docuere parentes  MART  S  INCE genius is the chief requisite in all kinds of poetry nothing can be more con∣trary to the very essence of it than the adopting as beauties certain arts which are merely mechanical There are daily arising many whimsical excellencies which have no foun∣dation in nature but are only countenanced by the present mode of writing with these it is as easy to fill our compo∣sitions as to dress ourselves in the fashion but the writer who puts his work together in this manner is no more a poet than his taylor Such productions often betray great labour and exactness but shew no genius for those who sit down to write by rule and follow  "dry receipts how  poems should be made"  may compose their pieces with∣out the least assistance from the imagination as an apothe∣cary's prentice though unable to cure any disease can make up medicines from the physician's prescription with no more knowledge of physic than the names of the drugs Thus the Muse that ought to fly and  "ascend the brightest heaven of invention"  walks in leadingstrings or is sup∣ported by a gocart  AMONG the many poetical tricks of this sort none has been more successfully practised or had more advocates and admirers than a certain fantastical conceit called ALLITERA∣TION which is nothing more than beginning two three or perhaps every word in a line with the same letter This method of running divisions upon the alphabet and pressing particular letters into the service has been accounted one of the first excellencies in versification and has indeed received the sanction of some of our best poets but wherein the beauty of it consists is something difficult to discover since  Quarles  or  Withers  might practise it with as much adroit∣ness as  Dryden  or  Spenser  It is one of those modern arts in poetry which require no fancy judgment or learning in the execution for an author may huddle the same letters on each other again and again as mechanically as the printer selects his types and ranges them in whatsoever order he pleases  THIS partial attachment to particular letters is a kind of contrast to the famous Odyssey of  Tryphiodorus  where every letter in the alphabet was in its turn excluded and the Al∣literator must be as busily employed to introduce his favou∣rite vowel or consonant as the  Greek  poet to shut out the let∣ter he had proscribed Nothing is esteemed a greater beauty  in poetry than a happy choice of epithets but Alliteration reduces all the elegancies of expression to a very narrow com∣pass Epithets are culled indeed with great exactness but the closest relation they are intended to bear to the word to which they are joined is that the initials are the same Thus the  fields  must be  flowry beauty  must be  beaming ladies  must be  lovely  and in the same manner must the  "waves wind their watry way"  the  "blustring blasts blow"  and  "locks all loosely lay"  not for the sake of the poetry but the elegance of the Alliteration This beauty has also taken possession of many of our tragedies and I have seen ladies wooed and heroes killed in it though I must own I never hear an actor dying with deadly darts and fiery flames c but it always puts me in mind of the celebrated pippinwoman in  Gay  's  Trivia  whose head when it was severed from her body rolled along the ice crying  pip pip pip  and expired in Alliteration  THE same false taste in writing that  "wings display'd and altars rais'd"  also introduced Alliteration and Acros∣tics in particular are the same kind of spellingbook poetry It is therefore somewhat extraordinary that those sublime writers who have disgraced their pages with it did not leave this as well as the other barbarous parts of literature to the  Goths  in poetry since it is a whimsical beauty below the practice of any writer superior to him who turned the  Aencid  into Monkish verses  Shakespeare  who was more indebted to nature than art has ridiculed this low trick with great humour in his burlesque tragedy of  Pyramus  and  Thisbe  Besides that noted passage of  With blade with bloody blameful blade  He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast  He before introduces a mock rant which  Bottom  calls  Ercles'  vein which is not only rank fustian but is also remarkable for its Alliteration  To make all split the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gatesand  Phibbus  car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates  In this strange stile have whole poems been written and every learned reader will recollect on this occasion the  Pugna Porcorum per P Porcium Poetam  which I wish some of our poetasters would translate in the true spirit of the original and praise pigs and pork with all the beauties of Alliteration  THE advocates and admirers of this practice have assert∣ed that it adds significance and strength of expression to their verses but I fear this boasted energy seldom appears to the reader The Alliteration either remains unregarded or if it is very striking disgusts those who perceive it and is often in itself from such a disagreeable cluster of the same letters harsh and uncouth There are very many instances where Alliteration though studiously introduced renders the versification rough and inharmonious and I will appeal to the greatest lovers of it whether the following line where the repetition was scarce intended is one of the most pleasing in all  Virgil  's works  Neu patriae Validas in Viscera Vertite Vires  IT must be acknowledged that there is something very mechanical in the whole construction of the numbers in most of our modern poetry Sound is more attended to than sense and the words are expected to express more than the sentiment There are set rules to make verses run off glibly or drawl slowly on c and I have read many a  poem with scarce one tolerable thought in it that has con∣tained all these excellencies of versification for which reason I must confess myself no friend to those critics who analyse words and syllables and discover latent beauties in every letter when the author intended that the whole should be taken together Poetry should seem at least to flow freely from the imagination and not to be squeezed from the droppings of the brain If we would endeavour to acquire a full idea of what we mean to describe we should then of course express ourselves with force elegance and perspi∣cuity and this native strength of expression would have more true energy than elaborate phrases and a quaint and studied combination of words and letters Fine numbers are undoubtedly one of the chief beauties in poetry but to make the sound echo to the sense we should make the sense our chief object This appears to me to have been the manly practice of the Ancients and of our own  Shake∣speare Milton  c who breathed the true spirit of poetry without having recourse to little tricks and mean artifices which only serve to disgrace it A good writer who would be above triffling even with a thought would never persue words and play with letters but leave such a childish em∣ployment for the small fry of rhimers who amuse them∣selves with anagrams and crambo The true poet trusts to his natural ear and strong conception and knows that the versification is adapted to the sentiment without culling particular letters and stringing them on his lines as he is sure that his verses are just measure without scanning them on his fingers  THERE are almost daily published certain Lilliputian volumes entitled  Pretty Books for Children  A friend of mine  who considers the little rhimers of the age as only  "children of a larger growth"  who amuse themselves with rhimes instead of rattles proposes to publish a small pocket volume for the use of our Poetasters It will be a treatise on the art of poetry  adapted to the meanest capacities  for which sub∣scriptions will be taken and specimens may be seen at  George  's and the  Bedford  coffeehouses It will contain full directions how to modulate the numbers on every occa∣sion and will instruct the young scribbler in all the modern arts of versification He will here meet with infallible rules how to soften a line and lull us to sleep with liquids and dipthongs to roughen the verse and make it roar again with reiteration of the letter R to set it hissing with semi∣vowels to make it pant and breathe short with a hun∣dred heavy aspirates or clog it up with the thickest double consonants and monosyllables with a particular table of Al∣literation containing the choicest epithets for any words that can be wanted To be illustrated with examples from the modern poets The whole to be published about the mid∣dle of the winter under the title of  The Rhimer's Plaything  or  Poetaster's Hornbook  since there is nothing necessary to form such a poet except teaching him his letters  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXIV THURSDAY  September    Tu dum tua navis in alto est  Hoc age  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  Y  OU obliged the world some time ago with a few reflections on the Gentlemen of the Army at the present juncture a word or two on our SeaOfficers would not be un∣seasonable I do not mean that you should presume to direct them how to behave in their several stations but rather to remark on their conduct and conver∣sation in private life as far as they are influenced by their maritime characters There is a certain unfashionable dye which their manners often take from the saltwater that tinctures their whole behaviour on shore If you could  assist in blotting out these stains and give a new colour to their conduct you would add grace and politeness to their ordinary conversation and would be of as much service to our naval commanders in this point as he was to navigation in general who first invented the compass  AS the conversation of those fairweather foplings many of whom may be met with in the three regiments of guards is usually flat and insipid that of our seaofficers is turbulent and boisterous and as a trip to  Paris  has perhaps overrefined the coxcomb in red a voyage round the world fre∣quently brutalizes the seaman who comes home so rough and unpolished that one would imagine he had not visited any nation in the world except the Savages the  Chinese  or the  Hottentots  The many advantages he has received from having seen the customs and manners of so many different people it is natural to suppose would render his conver∣sation very desirable as being in itself particularly instructive and entertaining but this roughness which clings to the seaman's behaviour like tar to his trowsers makes him un∣fit for all civil and polite society He behaves at an assembly as if he was upon deck and his whole deportment mani∣festly betrays that he is according to the common phrase quite out of his element Nor can you collect any more from him concerning the several nations he has visited than if he had been during the whole time confined to his cabin and he seems to know as little of them as the fine gentleman of his travels after the polite tour when he has for the sake of improvement rid post through all  Europe  THAT our ordinary seamen who are many of them draughted from the very lowest of the populace should be thus uncivilized is no wonder The common sailor's  education in  Broad St Giles's Tottenham Court  or at  Hock∣ley in the Hole  has not qualified him to improve by just reflections on what he sees during his voyage and going on board a man of war is a kind of university education suitably adapted to the principles imbibed in the polite semi∣naries which he came from A common sailor too is full as polite as a common soldier and behaves as genteely to a  Wapping  landlady as the gentleman soldier at a suttlinghouse But surely there ought to be as much difference in the behaviour of the commander and his crew as there is in their situation and it is beneath the dignity of the  British  Flag to have an Admiral behave as rudely as a Swabber or a Commodore as foulmouthed as a Boatswain  IT may perhaps be alledged in excuse that the being placed among such a boisterous set of people as our com∣mon sailors must unavoidably wear off all politeness and goodmanners as it is remarkable that all those who are employed in the care of horses grow as mere brutes as the animals they attend and as we may often observe those justices whose chief business is the examination of high∣waymen housebreakers and streetwalkers grow at least as vulgar and foulmouthed as a pickpocket As there may be some truth in this the commander should therefore be still more on his guard to preserve the gentleman in his behaviour and like the sea itself when the storm is over grow smooth and calm It is accounted a piece of humour on the  Thames  to abuse the other passengers on the water and there are certain set terms of abuse which fly to and fro from one boat to another on this occasion A wag might perhaps amuse himself with this waterlanguage in his voyage to  VauxHall  but must be a very silly fellow indeed to think of carrying the joke on shore with him In  the same manner some roughness may perhaps be necessary to keep the crew in order but it is absurd for an officer to retain his harshness in polite company and is in a manner tying his friends up to the yardarm and disciplining all his acquaintance with the catofninetails  BUT the worst part of this maritime character is a certain invincible contempt which they often contract for all man∣kind except their fellowseamen They look on the rest of the world as a set of freshwater wretches who could be of no service in a storm or an engagement and from an unaccountable obstinacy are particularly deaf to any proposals of new improvements in navigation though experience daily teaches them the great use of the discoveries already made and how much room there is for more They have no notion how studious men can sit in their closets and devise charts and instruments to direct them in their course and despise those ingenious persons who would assist them in their undertakings while they consider them with the utmost contempt as going round the world in their closets and sailing at sea in their elbowchairs It is no less shameful than true that the Ventilator one of the most beneficial inventions that ever was devised was first offered to the service of our men of war and rejected It was first used in foreign ships then by our merchantmen and last of all among our men of war to whose use it was first recom∣mended This is a strong proof of that fatal obstinacy which our SeaCommanders are too apt to contract and as a further instance of it I have been told of an Admiral's indignation on this subject venting itself in the following manner  "A pack of blockheads said he sit poring and pretend to make improvements for our use They  tell you that they discover this and discover that but I tell you they are all foolsFor instance now they say the world is round every one of them says the world is roundbut I have been all round the world and it is as flat as this table"  THE chief reason of their unpolished behaviour is owing to their being often sent to sea very young with little or no education beyond what they have received perhaps at the academy of  Woolwich  or  Portsmouth  A lad of good family but untoward parts or mischievous disposition who has been flogged for a while at the grammarschool or snubbed by his parents and friends at home is frequently clapped on board a ship in order to tame him and to teach him better manners Here perhaps he at first messes with the lowest of the seamen and all that the young gentle∣man can learn from his jolly mesmates in the course of two or three voyages is to drink flip sing a bawdy catch and dance an hornpipe These genteel accomplishments he is sure to retain as he grows old in the service and if he has the good fortune to rise to a command he is as surly and brutal when advanced to the cabin as when he was tugging before the mast  AFTER all it is but justice to confess that there are many among our SeaOfficers who deservedly bear the character of gentlemen and scholars and it is easy to perceive with how much better grace they appear in the world than the rest of their brethren who when laid up and taken out of service are as mere logs as the mainmast An officer who has any relish for reading will employ the many vacant hours in which he is relieved from duty much more to his improve∣ment  and satisfaction than in sauntering between the decks or muddling over a bowl of punch I would therefore seri∣ously recommend it to those young sailors who have the hap∣piness to launch forth with a genteel and liberal education not to suffer every trace of it to be washed away like words written on the sands but that when they return from sea they may be fit to be admitted at St  James  's as well as at  Wapping  or  Rotherhithe  BEFORE I conclude I must beg leave to say a word or two concerning our SeaChaplains The common sailors are known to have when on board a very serious regard for religion and their decent behaviour at prayers and sedate attention to the sermon upon quarterdeck might shame a more polite audience at St  James  's Church For this rea∣son a truly religious Chaplain of good morals and sober con∣versation will necessarily have as much influence on their be∣haviour as a mild and prudent Commander Nor can a clergyman be too circumspect in this point since if he does not act in every respect conformable to his function his place for ought I know might be as well supplied by any one of the unbeneficed Doctors of the Fleet In a word if a Chaplain will so far divest himself of his sacred character as to drink swear and behave in every respect like a com∣mon sailor he should be obliged to work in the gangway all the rest of the week and on sundays be invested with a jacket and trowsers instead of his canonicals  I am sir your humble servant T FORECASTLE  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXV THURSDAY  September    Nos animorum  Impulsu et caecâ magnáque cupidine ducti  HOR  S  O long ago as my fourth number the reader perhaps may not remember I made men∣tion of a FEMALE THERMOMETER constructed by my ingenious friend Mr  James Ayscough  Optician on  LudgateHill  and I then informed the public that  "the liquor contained within the tube was a chymical mixture which being acted upon by the circulation of the blood and animal spirits would rise and fall according to the desires and affections of the wearer"  But I have now the further satisfaction to acquaint my fair readers that after several repeated trials and improvements we have at length brought  the instrument to so great a degree of perfection that any common bystander may by a proper application of it know the exact temperature of any lady's passions The liquor among other secret ingredients is distilled  secundúm artem  from the herbs lady's love and maidenhair the wax of virginbees and the five greater hot and cold seeds and the properties of it are so subtle and penetrating that immediately on its coming within the atmosphere of a lady's affections it is actuated by them in the same manner as the spirits are by the impulse of the air in the common Ther∣mometer  IT was not without some difficulty that we could settle the different degrees of heat and cold in a lady's desires which it would be proper to delineate on our Thermometer but at last we found that the whole scale of female characters might be reduced to one or other of the fol∣lowing  viz  Abandoned IMPUDENCE  GALLANTRY  LOOSE BEHAVIOUR  INNOCENT FREEDOMS  INDISCRETIONS  Inviolable MODESTY  FROM these degrees which we have accurately marked on the side of the tube we have been able to judge of the characters of several ladies on whom we have made the experiment In some of these we have found the grada∣tions very sudden and that the liquor has risen very fast from the lowest point to the highest We could likewise discover that it was differently affected according to the  different station and quality of the subject so that the same actions which in a lady of fashion scarce raised the liquor beyond INDISCRETIONS in another caused it to mount almost to IMPUDENCE Much also depended upon the air and temperature of the place where we made our trials and even the dress had some influence on our Thermo∣meter as we frequently observed that the rise and fall of the liquor in the tube bore an exact proportion to the rise and fall of the stays and petticoat  I SHALL now proceed to give a succinct account of the many repeated experiments which we have made on differ∣ent subjects in different places During the winter season we had frequent opportunities of trying the effects which the playhouse the opera and other places of diversion might have on the Thermometer At the playhouse we always found the liquor rise in proportion as the drama was more or less indecent or immoral at some comedies and particularly the  Chances  its elevation kept pace exactly with the lusciousness of the dialogue and the ripening of the plot so that it has often happened that with some subjects at the opening of the play the liquor has struggled awhile and rose and sunk about the degrees just above MODESTY but before the third act it has stood suspended at the middle point between MODESTY and IMPUDENCE in the fourth act it has advanced as far as LOOSE BEHA∣VIOUR and at the conclusion of the play it has settled at downright IMPUDENCE At public concerts and the opera especially we observed that the Thermometer constantly kept time if I may say so with the music and singing and both at the opera and the playhouse it always regulated its motions by the dancer's heels We have frequently  made trials of our instrument at the masquerades in the  HayMarket  but the temperature of that climate has proved so exceeding hot that on the moment of our coming into the room the liquor has boiled up with a surprising effer∣vescence to ABANDONED IMPUDENCE  DURING the summer season we have not failed to make our observations on the company at the public gardens Here we found indeed that with some raw unpolished females who came only to eat cheesecakes and see the fireworks the liquor did not stir beyond MODESTY with many it has crept up to INDISCRETIONS and with some it has advanced to LOOSE BEHAVIOUR We had no opportunity to try our Thermometer in the dark walks but with some subjects we have plainly perceived the liquor hastening up towards INNOCENT FREEDOMS as they were retiring to these walks from the rest of the company whilst with others who have gone the same way it has only con∣tinued to point as it did at the beginning of our obser∣vations at GALLANTRY One young lady in particular we could not help remarking whom we followed into  VauxHall  gallanted by an officer we were glad to see at her first going in that the liquor though it now and then faintly aspired towards INDISCRETIONS still gravitated back again to MODESTY after a turn or two in the walks we perceived it fluctuating between INNOCENT FREEDOMS and LOOSE BEHAVIOUR after this we lost sight of them for some time and at the conclusion of the entertainment as we followed them out we could not without concern observe that the liquor was hastily bubbling up to a degree next to IMPUDENCE  BESIDES the experiments on those ladies who frequent the public places of diversion we have been no less careful in making remarks at several private routs and assemblies We were here at first very much surprised at the extreme degree of  Cold  which our Thermometer seemed to indicate in several ladies who were seated round the cardtables as we found not the least alteration in it either from the young or old but we at last concluded that this was owing to their love of play which had totally absorbed all their other passions We have indeed more than once perceived that when a lady has risen from cards after so much ill luck as to have involved herself in a debt of honour to a gentle∣man the Thermometer has been surprisingly effected and as she has been handed to her chair we have known the liquor which before was quite stagnate run up instantane∣ously to the degree of GALLANTRY We have also been at the trouble to try its efficacy in the long rooms at  Bath Tun∣bridge Cheltenham  c as it is well known that these places have brought about surprising changes in the constitutions of those SICK ladies who go thither for the benefit of the waters  HAVING thus sufficiently proved the perfection of our Thermometer it only remains to acquaint my readers that Mr  Ayscough  will be ready to supply the public with these useful instruments as soon as the town fills In the mean time I would advise those ladies who have the least regard for their characters to reflect that the gradations as marked on our Thermometer naturally lead to each other that the transitions from the lowest to the highest are quick and obvious and that though it is very easy to advance it is impossible to recede back again Let them therefore be  careful to regulate their passions in such manner as that their conduct may be always consistent with decency and honour and as  Shakespeare  says  "not stepping o'er the bounds of MODESTY"  I shall conclude with observing that these Thermometers are designed only for the ladies for though we imagined at first that they might serve equally for the men we have found reason to alter our opinion since in the course of several fruitless experiments on our own sex there has scarce appeared any medium in them between MODESTY and IMPUDENCE  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXVI THURSDAY  September    Viâ sacrâ sicut meus est mos  Nescio quid meditans nugarum et totus in illis  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  T has been generally imagined that learn∣ing is only to be acquired in the closet and by turning over a great number of pages for which reason men have been assiduous to heap together a parcel of dusty volumes and our youth have been sent to study at the universities as if knowledge was shut up in a library and chained to the shelves together with the folios This prejudice has made every one overlook the most obvious and ready means of coming at literature while as the wise man has re∣marked  "Wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words"  and no man regardeth her Every lane teems with instruction and every alley is big with erudition though the ignorant or incurious passerby shuts his eyes against that universal volume of arts and sciences which constantly lies open before him in the highways and byeplaces like the laws of the  Romans  which were hung up in the public streets  YOU must know Mr TOWN that I am a very hard student and have perhaps gleaned more knowledge from my reading than any of your poring fellows of colleges though I was never possessed of so much as an hornbook In the course of my studies I have followed the example of of the ancient  Peripatetics  who used to study walking and as I had not the advantage to be brought up a scholar I have been obliged like the  Lacedaemonian  children to the public for my education My first relish for letters I got by conning over those elegant monosyllables which are chalked out upon walls and gates and which as pretty books for children are adorned with cuts are generally en∣forced and explained by curious hieroglyphics in  caricatura  I soon made a further progress in the alphabet by staring up at the large letters upon playbills c 'till at length I was enabled to make out the inscriptions upon signs bills on empty houses and the titles on rubricposts From these I proceeded gradually to higher branches of literature and went through a complete course of physic by perusing the learned treatises of Dr  Rock  and other eminent practi∣tioners Having thus laid in the rudiments of literature my  method has since been to visit the  Philobiblian  libraries and other learned stalls and the noble collections at  Moorfields  in which choice repositories I have with infinite pleasure and advantage ran over the elaborate systems of ancient divines politicians and philosophers which have escaped the fury of pastrycooks and trunkmakers As for the modern writings of pamphletteers and magazinecompilers I make it my business to take my rounds every morning at the open shops about the  Royal Exchange  where I never fail to run through every thing fresh as it comes out Thus for example I make a shift to squint over the first page of the  Connoisseur  as it lies before me at Mrs  Cooke  's at the next shop I steal a peep at the middle pages at another proceed on to the fourth or fifth and perhaps return again to conclude it at Mrs  Cooke  's By the same means I am myself become a  Connoisseur  likewise and you will be sur∣prised when I assure you that I have a great variety of the finest prints and paintings and am master of a more curious set of nicknacks than are to be found in Sir  Hans Sloane  's  Collection  for as I constantly survey the windows of every printshop and attend every auction I look upon every curiosity as actually in my possession and you will agree with me that while I have the opportunity of seeing them the real owners cannot have more satisfaction in locking them up in cabinets and musaeums  YOU will conclude that the knowledge which I have thus picked out of the streets has been very extensive I have learned at every corner that the scurvy is a popular diseasethat the bloody flux cannot be cured by any of the faculty except the gentlewoman at the blue posts in  Haydon Yard  that nervous diseases were never so frequent  and that the royal family and most of our nobility are troubled with cornsand many other curious particulars of the same kind I have also got a smattering of the  French  language from the advertisements of taylors and staymakers and of Mrs  Dubois  's portable soop in  French  and  English  I was completely grounded in politics by stopping at  Temple Bar  every morning to read the  Gazzetteer  which used to be pasted up there to the great emolument of the hackneycoachmen upon their stands But above all I have acquired the most sublime notions of religion by listening attentively to the spirited harangues of our most eminent fieldpreach∣ers and I confess myself highly obliged to the itinerant missionaries of  Weslley Whitefield  and  Zinzendorf  who have instructed us in the New Light from empty barrels and jointstools Next to these I have received great im∣provements from the vociferous retailers of poetry as I constantly used to thrust myself into the circle gathered round them and listen to their ditties till I could carry away both words and tune I have likewise got some notion of the drama by attending the theatres though my finances were too scanty for me ever to get admittance into them I therefore had recourse to the following practice I would contrive to hear one act at the outside of one of the pitdoors the next act I took my stand at the other and as the author generally rises in the middle I could catch the most tearing parts during the third act in the passage to the twoshilling gallery in the fourth act the rants came tole∣ably loud to my ear at the entrance of the upper gallery and I very attentively listened to the pathetic at the con∣clusion of the play with the footmen in the lobby  ENDOWED with so much learning you will doubtless be curious to know to what purposes I have turned it Al∣most before I could read at all I got into the service of a very eminent doctor of physick who employed me in stick∣ing up his bills and slipping them slily into the hands of spindleshanked young fellows as they passed by After this by closely studying these elegant compositions I got together a sufficient set of medical phrases which by the help of  Bayley  's dictionary enabled me to draw up bills and affidavits for those doctors who were not so happy as to be able to write or read I was next promoted to the gar∣ret of a printer of bloody murders where my business was to invent terrible stories write  Yorkshire  tragedies or Christ∣mas carrols and occasionally to put the Ordinary of  New∣gate  's Account of Dying Speeches into lamentable rhyme I was afterwards concerned in works that required a greater fund of erudition such as boghouse miscellanies and little books for children and I was once engaged as the principal compiler of a twopenny magazine Since that I followed the occupation of an Evesdropper or Collector of News for the daily papers in which I turned a good penny by hunting after marriages and deaths and inventing lyes for the day Once indeed being out of other business I de∣scended to the mean office of a balladsinger and hawked my own verses but not having a good ear for music and the tone of my voice being rather inclined to whining I con∣verted my ballads into penitential hymns and took up the vocation of Methodist Preacher In this station I made new converts every day among the old women by my sighs and groans who in return contributed their halfpence which I disposed of in charityto myself but I was at last beat off the field by a journeyman shoemaker who fairly outwhined  me and finding myself deserted by my usual audi∣ence I became Setter to a Fleetparson  MY employment now was to take my stand at the end of  FleetMarket  and whenever I saw any gaping young couple staring about them to whisper them softly in the ear and ask them whether they wanted to be married assuring them withal that ours was the only marriagebooth in the fair Whenever the ceremony was performed I officiated as clerk and when my master the doctor died I made a shift to purchase his entire stock in trade consisting of a rusty cassock an old grizzle wig and one lappet of a band and succeeded him in his benefice of the  HandandPen Chapel  I now got a more comfortable subsistance than many regularly ordained curates in the country but the marriageact soon after taking place I was flung out of employ and as the Primate of  MayFair  the reverend Dr  Keith  is forced to sell snuff in the Fleetprison I have been obliged to re∣tail gin in a nightcellar  THUS Mr TOWN have I set before you the progress I have made in literature as well as the particular circumstances of my life in hopes they will induce you to the notice of the public As the parliament has not thought fit to make any provision for the poor distrest Clergy of the Fleet I in∣tend to open a New OratoryChapel in  Fleetmarket  to be conducted on the same principles with that established in  Claremarket  and for which I flatter myself I shall appear no less qualified by my education than the renowned  Henley  or any of his butchers I shall therefore beg leave to

dignum tanto tibi ventre gulâque precabor  MART  E  ATING and drinking being absolutely requisite to keep our crazy frames together we are obliged to attend to the calls of na∣ture and satisfy the regular cravings of the appetite Though it is in truth but a very small part of the world that eat because they are hungry or drink because they are dry The common daylabourer may indeed be glad to snatch an hasty meal with his wife and children that he may have strength to return to his work and the porter finds it necessary to refresh himself with a full pot of entire butt while he rests his load upon the bulk at the alehouse door but those who have more leisure to study what they shall eat and drink require some∣thing  more in their food than what is barely wholsome or necessary their palates must be gratified with rich sauces and highseasoned delicacies and they frequently have re∣course to whetters and provocatives to anticipate the call of hunger and to enable their stomachs to bear the load they lay on it There are a sort of men whose chief pride is a good taste as they call it and a great stomach and the whole business of their lives is included in their breakfast dinner and supper These people of whatever rank and denomination whether they regale with turtle or devour shoulders of mutton and peckloaves for wagers whether a duke at  White  's or a chairman at the  BluePosts  are cer∣tainly of the number of those  "whom nature as  Sallust  tells us has made like the brutes obedient to their bellies"  and indeed partake in some measure of the sentence passed on the Serpent  "to be cursed  above  all cattle and to go for ever on their bellies"  THERE are many follies and vices which men endeavour to hide from the rest of the world but this above all others they take a pride in proclaiming and seem to run about with the cap and bells as if they were ambitious to be ranked among the Sons of Folly Indeed as the politeness of the  French  language has distinguished every glutton by the title of  Bon Vivant  and the courtesy of our own has honoured their beastly gluttony by the name of  Good Living  the epi∣cure thinks to eat and drink himself into your good opinion and recommend himself to your esteem by an exquisite bill of fare However this may be it is remarkable that as the foxhunter takes delight in relating the incidents of the chace and kills the fox again over a bowl of punch at night so the  Bon Vivant  enjoys giving an account of a de∣licious  dinner and chews the cud of reflection on such ex∣quisite entertainment  I HAVE been led into these thoughts by an acquaintance which I have lately made with a person whose whole con∣versation is litterally speaking  TableTalk  His brain seems to be stuffed with an hodgepodge of ideas consisting of several dishes which he is perpetually serving up for the en∣terainment of the company As it was said of  Longinus  that he was a Walking Library in the same manner I con∣sider this gentleman as a Walking Larder and as the ora∣tions of  Demosthenes  were said to smell of the lamp so my friend's whole conversation savours of the kitchen He even makes use of his stomach as an artificial memory and recol∣lects every place he has been at and every person he has seen by some circumstances relating to the entertainment he met with If he calls to mind any inn he adds  "for there the cook spoiled a fine turbot"  another house is recollected  "because the parson took all the fat of the haunch of venison"  he remembers a gentleman you mention  "because he had the smallest stomach he ever knew"  or one lady  "because she drank a great deal of wine at supper"  and another  "because she has the best receipt for making her pickled cu∣cumbers look green"  HIS passion for eating also influences all his actions diversions and studies He is fond of harehunting as he says his persuit is animated by the hopes of seeing puss smoking on the table but he wonders how any man can venture his neck in a chace after a fox which when it is got is not worth eating He has had occasion to visit the  several Wells in this kingdom which he considers not as places where persons go to drink the waters but where they go to eat and in this light he gives a character of them all  "  Bath  says he is one of the best markets in the world At  Tunbridge  you have fine mutton and most exquisite wheatears But at  Cheltenham  pox take the place you have nothing but cowbeef red veal and white bacon"  He looks upon every part of  England  in the same light and would as soon go to  Cheshire  for butter and  Suffolk  for cheese as miss eating what each particular town or county is famous for having the most excellent in its kind He does not grudge to ride twenty miles to dine on a favourite dish and it was but last week that he appointed a friend in  Buckinghamshire  to meet him at  Uxbridge  "which says he in his letter is the best place we can settle our business at on account of those excellent rolls we may have for breakfast and the delicious trout we are sure to have at dinner"  MR CRAMWELL for that is his name is so unfortunate as to want a purse adequate to his taste so that he is put to several shifts and obliged to have recourse to several arti∣fices to gratify his appetite For this purpose he has with great pains constituted a Club consisting of persons most likely to promote Good Living This Society is composed of members who are all of them of some trade that can furnish it with provisions except one country squire who supplies it with game and they are obliged to send in the best of whatever their trade deals in at prime cost by which wise management the Club is supplied with every delicacy the seasons affords at the most reasonable rates Upon any vacancy much care and deliberation is used in  electing a new member A candidate's being able to de∣vour a whole turkey with an equal proportion of chine or eat one haunch of venison with the fat of another as sauce to it would be no recommendation On the contrary there was never more caution used at the death of a Pope to elect a successor who appears the most likely to be shortlived than by this Society of  Epicurean  Hogs to admit nobody of a stomach superior to their own Mr CRAMWELL on account of his extraordinary profici∣ency in the Science of Eating is honoured with the office of Caterer and has arrived to such a pitch of accuracy in the calculation of what is sufficient that he seems to gage the stomachs of the Club as an Exciseman does a cask and when all the members are present they seldom send away three ounces of meat from the table A Captain of a ship trading to the  WestIndies  has been admitted an hono∣rary member having contracted to bring over as a present to them a sufficient cargo of turtle every voyage and a few days ago I met CRAMWELL in prodigious high spirits when he told me that he was the happiest man in the world  "for now says he we shall have Ortolans as plenty as pidgeons for it was but yesterday that we balloted into our society one of the  FlanderkinBirdMerchants  "  This association for the preservation of elegant fare gratifies my friend CRAMWELL's luxury at a cheap rate and that he may make as many good meals as possible he often con∣trives to introduce himself to the tables of persons of quality This he effects by sending my lord or her ladyship a present of a  Bath Cheese  a  Ruff  or  LandRail  from his friends in  Lincolnshire  or  Somersetshire  which seldom fails to procure him an invitation to dinner It once happened that dining  with an Alderman his appetite got the better of his goodbreeding when he shaved off all the outside of a plumbpudding and he has ever since been talked of in the city by the name of SKINPUDDING  AS all his joy and misery constantly arises from his belly he thinks it is the same with others and I heard him ask a perfect stranger to him who complained that he was sick whether he had overeat himself It is no wonder that CRAMWELL should be sometimes troubled with the gout I called upon him the other morning and found him with his legs wrapped up in flannel and a book lying open before him upon the table On asking him what he was reading he told me he was  taking physic  and on enquiring whose advice he had  "Oh says he nobody can do me so much good as Mrs  Hannah Glasse  I am here going through a course of her  Art of Cookery  in hopes to get a stomach for indeed my dear friend added he with tears in his eyes my appetite is quite gone and I am sure I shall die if I do not find something in this book which I think I can eat"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER LXXXVIII THURSDAY  October    Fuit haud ignobilis Argis  Qui se credebat miros

into  the harbour believing them to be his own property The end of these madmen was also similar they were both cured and both complained that they were deprived of the satisfaction which they before enjoyed from a pleasing error of their minds  THAT the happiness and misery of the far greatest part of mankind depends upon the fancy need not be insisted on  Crede quòd habes et babes  Think that you have and you have is a maxim not confined to those only within the walls of  Bedlam  I remember an humourist who would fre∣quently divert himself in the same manner with the mad∣men abovementioned and supply his real wants by the force of his imagination He would go round the markets and suppose himself to be cheapening the most dainty provisions and when he came home to his scanty meal by the same ideal contrivance he would convert his trotters into turbot and his small beer into the most delicious Burgundy As he was a barber by trade he would put on the air and manners of his customers while he combed out their wigs with every bag he would conceive himself going to court or a ridotto and once when he was sick he got together three or four of the largest tyes placed them upon blocks round his bedside and called them a consultation of physicians  BUT of all others there are none perhaps who are more obliged to the imagination for their ideal happiness than the fraternity of which I am an unworthy member There is no set of people who are more ambitious to appear grand in the world and yet have less means than those gentlemen whom the world has stiled Authors Wit and pride as often  go hand in hand together as wit and poverty but though the generality of writers are by the frowns of fortune de∣barred from possessing a profuse share of the good things of this world they are abundantly recompenced by enjoying them in speculation They indulge in golden dreams at the time that they have not sixpence in their pockets and conjure up all the luxuries of  Pontac  's before them though they are at a loss perhaps where to get a dinner Thus a Critic by a kind of magic will transport himself to the thea∣tres in an imaginary gilt chariot and be seated at once in the frontboxes when in reality he has waited for two hours in  VinegarYard  before the opening of the doors to secure to himself a corner in the twelvepenny gallery Hence it also happens to most Authors that though their way of life be ever so mean their writings favour of the most unbounded magnificence and as they have nothing to bestow a most surprising generosity always accompanies every action of the quill Thus a Novellist for example is remarkably lavish of his cash on all occasions and spares no expence in carrying on the designs of his personages through ever so many volumes Nothing indeed is more easy than to be very profuse upon paper An author when he is about it may erect his airy castles to what height he pleases and with a wave of his pen may command the mines of  Peru  and as he deals about his money without once untying his pursestrings it will cost him the same whether he throws away a mite or a million and another dip of ink by the addition of two or three  gratis  cyphers may in an instant convert a single ten into as many thou∣sands We must not therefore be surprised that the heroes of our modern novels seem to possess the Purse of  Fortu∣natus  as their writers have all of them the power of his Wishingcap  BUT it must be confessed that we Essaywriters as we are the greatest  Egotists  are consequently most vain and ostentatious As we frequently find occasion to prate about ourselves we take abundant care to put the reader con∣stantly in mind of our importance It is very well known that we keep the best company are present at the most expensive places of diversion and can talk as familiarly of  White  's as if we had been admitted to the honour of lo∣sing an estate there Though the necessaries as well as the luxuries of life may perhaps be denied us we readily make up for the want of them by the creative power of the imagination Thus for instance I remember a bro∣ther Essayist who took a particular pride in dating his lu∣cubrations  From my own Apartment  which he represented as abounding with every convenience though at the same time he was working three stories from the ground and was often forced to scribble upon wrappers of tobacco for want of other paper As to myself I make no doubt but the reader has long ago discovered without my telling him that I loll at my ease in a crimson velvet chair rest my elbow on the polished surface of a mahogany table write my essays upon gilt paper and dip my pen into a silver standish  Indeed though I have taken upon me the Title of a CONNOISSEUR I shall not presume to boast that I am pos∣sessed of a  Musaeum  like  Sloane  's or a Library equal to  Mead  's But as  Pliny  and after him our countryman Mr  Pope  have left us a description of their elegant  Villa  I hope  it will not be thought arrogance in me after what I have said if I set before the reader an account of my own STUDY This is a little edifice situated at a small distance from the rest of the house for the sake of privacy and re∣tirement It is an ancient pile of building and hangs over a small rivulet which runs underneath it and as the entrance into it is shaded by a thick hedge of evergreens which cast a kind of awful gloom about it some learned antiquarians have been led to conjecture that it was formerly a Temple or rather Chapel of Ease dedicated to one of the heathen Goddesses This Goddess they inform me was worshipped by the  Romans  and was probably held in no less veneration by the  Aegyptians Chaldees Syrians  and other nations However this be the walls on the inside are deco∣rated with various inscriptions alluding to the religious rites performed there and hung round with the rude rhymes of ancient bards  TO this STUDY I retire constantly every morning after breakfast and at other parts of the day as occasions call Here I am at liberty to indulge my meditations unin∣terrupted as I suffer no one to break in upon my privacy and what will perhaps surprise my readers I find in myself the greatest inclination to visit it after an hearty meal In this place I have made a very rapid progress in literature and have gone through several very learned volumes which otherwise I should never have looked into I have here travelled leaf by leaf through the works of many worthy but neglected ancient divines critics and politicians and have turned over many a modern pamphlet or poem with equal satisfaction I must not forget to mention that like the scrupulous  Mahometans  I have often picked up the  fragments of several learned writers which have come from the chandlers and lodged them among others no less valu∣able in my STUDY  I MAY safely boast that I am indebted for many of my best thoughts in the course of these papers to the reflections I have had the leisure to make in this STUDY which pro∣bably has the same influence on my mind as the stew'd prunes which  Bayes  tells us he always took when he wrote But if my STUDY serves to inspire me sometimes with agre∣eable ideas it never fails on the other hand to remind me of the mortality of writers as it affords repeated proofs that we may justly say of our works as well as of ourselves  Seriùs aut citiùs SEDEM

est meae puellae  Passer deliciae meae puellae  Quem plus illa oculis suis amabat  CATULL  G  OING the other day to visit Mrs  Penelope Doat  after I had waited some time in the parlour the maid returned with her mistress's compliments and informed me that as she was extremely busy she begged to be excu∣sed coming down to me but that she would be very glad to see me in the  Nursery  As I knew she was a maiden lady I was a good deal startled at the message but how∣ever I followed the servant up stairs to her mistress whom I  found combing a little white dog that lay in her lap with a grey parrot perched on one arm of the settee where she sat a monkey on the back and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other corner The whole room which was a very large one was indeed a Nursery for all kinds of animals except those of the human species It was hung every where with cages containing parrots mackaws ca∣nary birds nightingales linnets goldfinches c on the chairs were several cats reposing on soft cushions and there were little kennels in the  Chinese  taste in almost every corner of the room filled with Pugs Fidos and King  Charles  's breed As soon as the chattering of the birds the barking of the dogs and the mewing of the cats which my entrance oc∣casioned began to cease  "You find me here Sir said the lady tending my little family the only joy of my life Here's a dear pretty creature holding up the dog she was combing a beauty sir a fine longeared snubnosed beauty Lady  Faddle  advertised three quarters of a year and cold not get the fellow to it Ah bless it and love it sweet soul"  And then she stroaked it and kissed it for near two minutes uttering the whole time all those inarticulate sounds which cannot be committed to paper and which are only addressed to Dogs Cats and Children and may be stiled the language of the Nursery Upon ob∣serving me smile at the embraces she bestowed on her little motley darling  "I am afraid said she you don't love these pretty creatures How can you be so cruel Poor  dumb  things I would not have them hurt for all the world nor do I see why a lady should not indulge herself in having such sweet little company about her as well as you men run out estates in keeping a pack of filthy  hounds"  Then she laid  Pompey  on his cushion by the fireside and railed at the barbarity of the human species to the rest of the creation and entered into a long dissertation on tenderness and humanity  A HUMANE disposition is indeed so amiable either in man or woman that it ought always to be cherished and kept alive in our bosoms but at the same time we should be cautious not to render the first virtue of our nature ridi∣culous The most compassionate temper may be sufficiently gratified by relieving the wretches of our own species but who would ever boast of their generosity to a lapdog and their conferring eternal obligations on a monkey or would any person deserve to be celebrated for their charity who should deny support to a relation or a friend because he maintains a litter of kittens For my part before I would treat a  Dutch  puppy with such absurd fondness I must be brought to worship dogs as the  Aegyptians  did of old and e'er I would so extravagantly doat upon a monkey I would as  Iago  says on a different occasion  "change my huma∣nity with a baboon"  YET there have been many instances besides my female friend of this fondness for the brute creation being carried to very ridiculous lengths The grave doctors of the faculty have been called in to feel the pulse of a lapdog and inspect the urine of a squirrel nay I am myself acquainted with a lady who carried this matter so far as to discharge her chaplain because he refused to bury her monkey But the most solemn piece of mummery on these occasions is the making provisions for these animals by will which absurd legacies as little deserve the title of humanity as those people  merit being called charitable who in a deathbed fright starve their relations by leaving their estates to found an hos∣pital It were indeed to be wished that money left in trust for such uses were subject to some statute of  Mortmain  or at least that the gentlemen of the long robe would contrive some scheme to cut off the entail from Monkeys Mackaws  Italian  Greyhounds and Tabby Cats  THAT a stage coachman should love his cattle better than his wife and children or a country squire be fond of his hounds and hunters is not so surprising because the reason of their regard for them is easily accounted for and a sea∣captain has upon the same principles been known to con∣tract an affection for his ship but no coachman would like  Caligula  tye his horses to a golden rack but thinks he shews sufficient kindness by filling them with good wholesome provender and the country sportsman takes care to provide his hounds with a good kennel and horse∣flesh but would never think of placing them on cushions before the fire and feeding them with fricasees or breed them with as much care as the heir to his estate This irre∣gular passion if I may so call it is most frequently to be met with among the ladies How often has the slighted gallant envied the caresses given to a lapdog or kisses be∣stowed on a squirrel and  "I would I were thy bird"  has been the fond exclamation of many a  Romeo  But it is remarkable that this affection for birds and beasts generally wears off after marriage and that the ladies discard their fourfooted darlings and feathered favourites when they can bestow their endearments on an husband Wherefore these dry nurses to Puggs and Grimalkins are mostly to be met with among those females who have been disappointed  in the affairs of love and have against their will retained the flower of virginity till it has withered in their possession It often happens that there is some kind of analogy between the gallant they once loved and the animal on which they afterwards fix their affections and I myself remember an instance of a lady's passion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot and have an old maiden aunt who once languished for a beau whose heart is now devoted to a monkey  BUT I should not so much quarrel with these humane ladies who chuse to settle their affections on the brute spe∣cies if they were not troublesome to others who are not so sensible of the charms of a snub nose or can discover any beauty in the grey eyes of a cat A doating mother would never forgive you if you did not call her brat a fine child and dangle it about and prattle with it with as much seeming rapture as herself and in like manner a lady would take it as an affront to her own person if you did not pay your adresses equally to her pug or her parroquet I know a young fellow that was cut off with a shilling by an old maiden aunt because he gave poor  Veny  a kick only for lifting up his leg against the gentleman's stocking and I have heard of another who might have carried off a very rich widow but that he could not prevail upon himself to extend his caresses to her dormouse Indeed I cannot help thinking that the embraces and endearments bestowed on these rivals of the human species should be as private as the most secret intrigues and I would have lapdogs like fretful and squalling children confined to bark and growl only in the Nursery We may often see a footman following his lady to church with a common prayerbook under one arm  a dog under the other I have also known a grave divine forced to stop short in the middle of a prayer while the whole congregation has been raised from their knees to attend to the howling of a lapdog and I once saw a tragedy monarch disturbed in his last moments as he lay expiring on the car∣pet by a little black dog of king  Charles  's breed who jumped out of the stagebox and seizing upon the hero's perriwig brought it off in his mouth and lodged it in his lady's lap  IT will not appear strange after what has been said that these ladies or ladylike gentlemen should be as sollicitous to preserve the breed of their favourite animals as a sports∣man of his hounds and horses I have known a gentleman in St  James  's street send his little  Cupid  in a sedan chair as far as  Grosvenor  square to wait upon a lady's  Veny  for this very purpose and I shall never forget a Card which was sent to another lady on a like occasion expressed in the fol∣lowing terms  "Mr 's compliments to Lady  Betty  is glad to hear Miss  Chloe  is safely delivered and begs it as a particular favour that her ladyship would be pleased to SET HIM DOWN FOR A PUPPY"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XC THURSDAY  October    Ego nec studium sine divite venâ  Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium  HOR  I  F we consider that part of our acquaintance whom we remember from their infancy we shall find that the expectations we once en∣tertained of their future abilities are in many instances disappointed Those who were accounted heavy dull boys have by diligence and application made their way to the first honours and become eminent for their learning and knowledge of the world while others who were regarded as bright lads and imagined to possess parts equal to any scheme of life have turned out dissolute and ignorant and quite unworthy the title of a Genius except in the modern acceptation of the word by which  it signifies a very silly young fellow who from his extrava∣gance and debauchery has obtained the name of a Genius like  lucus a non lucendo  because he has no Genius at all  IT is a shocking drawback from a father's happiness when he sees his son blessed with strong natural parts and quick conception to reflect that these very talents may be his ruin If vanity once gets into his head and gives it a wrong turn the young coxcomb will neglect the means of improvement trust entirely to his native abilities and be as ridiculously proud of his parts as the brats of quality are taught to be of their family In the mean time those whom nature threw far behind him are by application enabled to leave him at a distance in their turn and he continues boasting of his Genius till it subsists no longer but dies for want of cultivation Thus vanity and indolence prevents his improvement and if he is to rise in the world by his merit takes away the means of success and perhaps reduces him to very miserable distresses I know one of these early Geniuses who scarce supports himself by writing for a bookseller and another who is at leisure to contem∣plate his extraordinary parts in the Fleetprison  IF we look into the world we shall find that the mere Genius will never raise himself to any degree of eminence without a close and unwearied application to his respective business or profession The Inns of Court are full of these men of parts who cannot bear the drudgery of turning over dry Cases and Reports but though they appear ever so eloquent in taverns and coffeehouses not the nearest relation will trust them with a Brief And many a sprightly physician has walked on foot all his life with no more  knowledge of his profession than what lies in his perriwig For whatever opinion they themselves may have of their own parts other persons do not chuse to be bantered out of their estates or joked out of their lives And even in trade the plodding men of the Alley would foretell the bankruptcy of any wit among them who should laugh at the labour of Accounts or despise the  Italian  Method of Bookkeeping Thus we see that parts alone are not suf∣ficient to recommend us to the good opinion of the world and even these if not roused and called forth by study and application would become torpid and useless as the race∣horse though not put to drag a dray or carry a pack must yet be kept in exercise But I shall enlarge no further on this subject as I would not anticipate the thoughts con∣tained in the following elegant little Fable which as my correspondent informs me is written by the same ingenious hand that obliged the public with the Verses on  Imitation  inserted in my sixtyseventh number  The HARE and the TORTOISE  GENIUS blest term of meaning wide  For sure no term so misapply'd  How many bear the sacred name  That never felt a real flame  Proud of the specious appellation  Thus fools have christned Inclination  But yet suppose a Genius true  Exempli gratiâ  me or you  Whate'er he tries with due intention  Rarely escapes his apprehension  Surmounting ev'ry opposition  You'd swear he learnt by intuition  Should he presume alone on parts  And study therefore but by starts  Sure of success whene'er he tries  Should he forego the means to rise  Suppose your watch a  Graham  make  Gold if you will for value sake  It's springs within in order due  No watch when going goes so true  If ne'er wound up with proper care  What service is it in the wear  Some genial spark of  Phoebus'  rays  Perhaps within our bosom plays  O how the purer rays aspire  If Application fans the fire  Without it Genius vainly tries  Howe'er sometimes it seems to rise  Nay Application will prevail  When braggart parts and Genius fail  And now to lay my proof before ye  I here present you with a story  In days of yore when Time was young  When birds convers'd as well as sung  And use of speech was not confin'd  Merely to brutes of human kind  A forward Hare of swiftness vain  The Genius of the neighbouring plain  Would oft deride the drudging croud  For Geniuses are ever proud  His flight he'd boast 'twere vain to follow  For horse and dog he'd beat them  hollow    Nay if he put forth all his strength  Outstrip his brethren  half a length  A Tortoise heard his vain oration  And vented thus his indignation  O Puss it bodes thee dire disgrace  When I defy thee to the race  Come 'tis a matchnay no denial  I lay my shell upon the trial  'Twas done and done all fair a bet  Judges prepar'd and distance set  The scamp'ring Hare outstrip'd the wind  The creeping Tortoise lagg'd behind  And scarce had pass'd a single pole  When Puss had almost reach'd the goal  Friend Tortoise cries the jeering Hare  Your burthen's more than you can bear  To help your speed it were as well  That I should ease you of your shell  Jog on a little faster prithee  I'll take a nap and then be with thee  So said so done and safely sure  For say what conquest more secure  Whene'er he wak'd that's all that's in it  He could o'ertake him in a minute  The Tortoise heard the taunting jeer  But still resolv'd to  persevere    Still drawl'd along as who should say  I win like  Fabius  by delay  On to the goal securely crept  While Puss unknowing soundly slept  The betts are won the Hare awake  When thus the victor Tortoise spake  Puss though I own thy quicker parts  Things are not always won by starts  You may deride my aukward pace  But  slow and steady  wins the race  {inverted ⁂}It is necessary to acquaint the Public that the

an sint virtute beati  Et quae sit natura BONI  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  T  HE explanation which you gave us some time ago of GOOD COMPANY has led me to consider the import and extent of the epithet GOOD which in the modern sense of the word is indiscrimi∣nately applied to things very bad in their nature and is sometimes used only as a term of reproach  To begin first with what is called a GOOD MAN By this one would imagine should be understood an honest virtuous and religious person but to look for a GOOD MAN in this strict acceptation of the phrase among the men of fashion would be as vain a search as that of  Diogenes  with his lanthorn in open daylight This appellation is indeed very familiarly used among the gentlemen of  'Change Alley  but there it is meant only to signify a  Rich  man He is there called a GOOD MAN who is able to answer a bill at sight though he is known to be ever so great a cheat So by the same unaccountable phraseology a scoundrel with a large estate is entitled a  Man of Worth  as among rakes the HONEST fellow may be the most abandoned debauchee and great∣est villain upon earth  BY the same figure the GOOD FELLOW is he who at a Country Wake can soil the best wrestler break most heads and challenge the ring take  Broughton  by the nose bid defiance to the  ClareMarket  butchers knock down the constables and watch in beating the rounds in  CoventGarden  bilk the waiter and kick the bully out of doors in the hundreds of  Drury  carry off his six bottles of port at a sitting or drink October till he leaves the country squire and the parson on the floor  AS to the other sex the term GOOD WOMAN is applied as a mere expletive without any meaning to the poor only or perhaps to get rid of the importunity of a beggar In the country indeed a GOOD LADY is sometimes mentioned with a sneer or as a term of reproach and means one who is so oldfashioned as to go to church say her prayers  and convert her dressing room into an apothecary's shop But I would ask any wellbred lady if she would be content to banish herself from the delights of the theatre opera∣house masquerades routs drums assemblies and the dear cardtable to be confined to the country have prayers in her own house twice a day and do charitable offices to her poor neighbours merely to acquire the ridiculous reputation of a GOOD LADY  I SHALL proceed next to consider what is generally under∣stood by a GOOD EDUCATION This is not to be found in either of our Universities nor is any learning or know∣ledge implied in it except what is called the  Knowledge of the World  which cannot be attained among pedants or gathered from musty books Common lads may be lashed through a grammarschool and afterwards locked up in colleges but young fellows of taste and spirit have better opportunities of improving themselves by mixing with the town and the  beau monde  For this reason they are intro∣duced very early into those excellent Seminaries of GOOD EDUCATION about  Covent Garden  and placed under the tuition of  Haddock Douglass Harris  c It is also neces∣sary to ground them in the genteel principles of infidelity and freethinking that they should attend the disputations at the  Robin Hood  and the lectures of the  Claremarket  Orator and it would not be amiss if they were to get a little notion of the modern Art of Criticism by frequenting the  Bedford  and  George  's coffeehouses After this it is proper to compleat their education that they should make the tour of  France  and  Italy  which will not fail to inspire them with the laudable love of every thing that is foreign and a thorough contempt for their own country  Nothing now remains but to instruct them in the noble Science of Gaming for which purpose it has been found expedient to constitute an Academy at  White  's where it is taught in all it's branches The consequences of such a GOOD EDUCATION as is here set down may be seen in many instances Some have been enabled by it to ruin their constitutions and others to run out their estates Some have received the finishing stroke of a GOOD EDU∣CATION at  Tyburn  while others have given sufficient proofs of it by being gallantly run through the body in a duel or genteelly shooting themselves through the head  LET us now take a view of the GOOD EDUCATION which is at present in vogue among the fair sex As the GOOD LADIES of former days were desirous that their daughters should make GOOD WIVES they thought the first step towards it was to make them GOOD HOUSE∣WIVES They therefore bred them up in the domestic arts of pickling preserving distilling simple waters and the like they also taught them to work at their needle write cast accounts and read a chapter in the Bible or some other Good BOOK as they are ridiculously oalled But this method of education has been found to be fit only for low girls designed to go to service or poor parsons daugh∣ters that must come to be milliners or something worse As to ladies of fashion to learn  English  would only obstruct their advancement in the  French  language which they are taught to  speak  from their infancy but never to read besides they will get a better knowledge of their mother tongue from the peculiar dialects used at routes and assem∣blies and the spirited conversations carried on at masquerades and other public places than they could possibly do from  books All the writing required is to be able to scrawl out a billetdoux for which we must also own that spellingbooks are of no service and working we know would hurt their eyes no less than reading As to religion honour virtue charity and the like oldfashioned cant nobody would think of stuffing any girl's head with it above the degree of a chambermaid  THE present notion of a GOOD Education was there∣fore unknown to the females of former ages as besides the usual accomplishments of dancing or the like it will be found to consist in the knowledge of Intriguing Dress and I may add too the Cardtable In the first of these particulars they constantly receive lessons from the milli∣ners mantuamakers and maidservants and by being carried about to all public places of diversion they soon become proficients in the sciences The same tutors like∣wise take care to instruct their young pupils in the Art of Dress and I have known a little miss by the time she was arrived at her teens so nice an adept in facepainting as to apply the  rouge  to her pretty cheeks with as much elegance and propriety as her mamma To conclude when a young lady has got  Hoyle  's rules by heart and is qua∣lified to play a rubbers at a Sunday route it is a sure mark of her having had a compleat GOOD EDUCATION  THERE are many other instances in which this word GOOD is perverted to a very preposterous sense Thus GOOD LIVING is made to signify the practice of no other excellence but what consists in Good Eating and Drinking but as you have formerly given us the character of one of these GOOD LIVERS I shall only take notice that the ill  humours consequent of their luxury and intemperance which shew themselves in blotches and breakings out on their faces are emphatically called their  Goodness  In like manner by GOOD BLOOD we are taught to understand a gentility of birth and though a nobleman be ever so noto∣rious for his vices or though his ancestors have been raised by the vilest means his posterity always pride themselves on the GOOD BLOOD of the family I would not be thought to quibble about words when I observe that the most shocking and blasphemous ridicule on the sacred tenets of our religion though without the least shadow of wit is by the present shallow race of freethinkers applauded as a GOOD JOKE The most cruel and unmanly actions are by our Bucks and Bloods set down under the same denomination and if blasphemy and profaneness is a GOOD JOKE a rape or a murder is upon the same pinciples esteemed a very GOOD THING  I am Sir your humble Servant PHILAGATHUS  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XCII THURSDAY  October    O nata mecum Consule Manlio  Seu tu querelas sive geris jocos  Seu rixam et insanos amores  Seu facilem pia testa somnum  Descende  HOR  D  RINKING is one of those popular vices which most people reckon among their venial failings and it is thought no great blot on a man's character to say he takes his glass rather too freely But as those vices are most dangerous and likely to prevail which if not approved are at least excused by most people I have been tempted to examine whether Drinking really deserves that quarter it receives from the generality of mankind and I  must own that after a strict attention to the principal mo∣tives that induce men to become harddrinkers as well as to the consequences which such excesses produce I am at a loss to account for the received maxim that  "in good wine there is truth"  and should no more expect happiness in a full bowl than chastity in the bar of a tavern  THE incentives to this practice are some of them very shocking and some very ridiculous as will perhaps appear from the following characters Poor  Heartly  was blest with every noble qualification of the head and heart and bade fair for the love and admiration of the world but was unfortunately bound in a very large sum for a friend who disappeared and left him to the mercy of the law The distresses thus brought upon him by the treachery of another threw him into the deepest despair and he had at last re∣course to drinking to benumb if possible the very sense of reflection He is miserable when sober and when drunk stupified and muddled His misfortunes have robbed him of all the joys of life and he is now endeavouring wilfully to put an end to them by a slow death  TOM BUCK from the first day that he was put into breeches was always accounted a boy of spirit and before he reached the top of  Westminster  school knew the names and faces of the most noted girls upon town tossed off his claret with a smack and had a long tick at the ta∣vern When he went to  Oxford  he espoused the Tory party because they drank deepest and he has for some years been accounted a fourbottle man He drank for fame and has so well established his character that he was never known to send a man from his chambers sober but gene∣rally laid his whole company under the table Since his  leaving the university nobody ever acquired more reputa∣tion by Electioneering for he can  see out  the stoutest free∣holder in  England  He has indeed swallowed many a tun in the service of his country and is now a sounder pa∣triot by two bottles than any man in the county  POOR  Wou'dbe  became a debauchée through mere bash∣fulness and a foolish sort of modesty that has made many a man drunk in spite of his teeth He contracted an acquaintance with a set of hard drinkers and though he would as soon chuse to swallow a dose of physic has not courage to refuse his bumper He is drunk every night and always sick to death the next morning when he con∣stantly resolves to drink nothing stronger than small beer for the future but at night the poor fellow gets drunk again through downright modesty Thus  Wou'dbe  suffers himself to be prest into the service and since he has com∣menced a jolly fellow is become one of the most miserable wretches upon earth  HONEST  Ned Brimmer  is at present the most dismal object that ever fell a sacrifice to liquor It was unluckily his first ambition to promote what is usually called Good Fellowship In this undertaking he has in a very few years entirely ruined his constitution and now stalks up and down in so piteous a condition as might inspire his companions with more melan∣choly reflections than an empty bottle He has quite lost all appetite and he is now obliged to keep up a weak arti∣ficial heat in his body by the same means that destroyed the natural warmth of his constitution Rum brandy and us∣quebaugh are his dietdrinks and he may perhaps linger a few months before he falls a martyr to Good Fellowship  HAVING thus taken a short view of the unhappy mo∣tives that induce men to become harddrinkers few perhaps will think such reasons any recommendation to Drunkenness nor can I imagine they will grow more fond of it by ob∣serving what strange creatures they are during their intoxi∣cation  Shakespeare  calls it  "putting a devil into their mouths to steal away their brains"  and indeed a cup too much turns a man the wrong side out and wine at the same time it takes away the power of standing from the legs de∣prives the mind of all sense and reflection It is whimsical enough to consider the different effects which wine produces on different tempers Sometimes like love it makes a fool sensible and a wise man an ass and seems to imbibe a new quality from every different body as water takes a tincture from the ground it runs through  HORACE has with great pleasantry recapitulated the various effects of wine in a stanza which I have placed at the head of this paper One man grows maudlin and weeps ano∣ther becomes merry and facetious a third quarrels throws a bottle at his companion's head and could run his dearest friend through the body a fourth is mad for a girl and falls in love with a streetwalker or an old woman roasting chesnuts while to a fifth the liquor serves as an opiate and lulls him to sleep  Shakespeare  has also shewn this vari∣ety of characters with great humour  Cassio  crys  "let's to business"  and immediately begins to hiccup out his prayers and belches out his hopes of salvation Justice  Silence  who does not speak a word while he is sober has no sooner swal∣lowed the rouzing cup than he roars out a catch and grows the noisiest man in the company It is reported to have been one of the most exquisite entertainments to the  choice spirits in the beginning of this century to get  Addison  and  Steele  together in company for the evening  Steele  enter∣tained them till he was tipsy when the same wine that stu∣pified him only served to elevate  Addison  who took up the ball just as  Steele  dropt it and kept it up for the rest of the evening They who have never been present at a scene of this kind may see the whole group of drunken characters displayed at one view with infinite humour in  Hogarth's Modern Midnight Conversation  THUS excess of drinking verifies all the transformations recorded in the fable of  Circe  's cup and perhaps the true reason why  Bacchus  is always painted with horns is to in∣timate that wine turns men into beasts Indeed if none were to indulge themselves in drinking except those who like  Steele  and  Addison  could be witty and agreeable in their cups the number of harddrinkers would be very hap∣pily diminished Most men have so little right to plead an excuse of this sort in vindication of their drunkenness that wine either makes them very rude very stupid or very mad It is a vulgar error to suppose that liquor only shews ill qualities since it also frequently creates them and engen∣ders notions in the mind quite foreign to its natural disposi∣tion which are the mere effects of wine and break out like blotches and carbuncles on the face The disgustful appearance which most people make when they are drunk was what induced the  Spartans  to intoxicate their slaves and shew them to their children in order to deter them from so odious a vice In like manner let the Choice Spirit who is often seen hanging his head over the pot or snoring in an armedchair in a tavern reflect what a shocking figure he must have made when he sees the drunken beggar sleeping on a bulk or rolling in the kennel  WHOEVER thus considers the motives that generally in∣duce men to give into these excesses and how ridiculous and unhappy they are often rendered by the effects will hardly be tempted by the charms of a bottle and indeed HardDrinking is frequently one among the many evils that arise from want of education The dull squire settled in the country who has no taste for literary amusements has nothing except his dogs and horses but his bumper to divert him and the town squire fits soaking for the same reasons in a tavern These are the common herd of  Bacchus  's swine but nothing is more shocking than to see a man of sense thus destroying his parts and constitution It not only makes a terrible innovation in his whole frame and intellects but also robs him of the society of those like himself with whom he should associate and reduces him to the level of a set of wretches since all may be admitted to his com∣pany and conversation who are able to toss off a bumper  THESE considerations are sufficient to convince us of the evils which result from harddrinking but it will shock us still more if we reflect how much it will influence our life and conduct Whoever is engaged in a profession will never apply to it with success while he sticks so close to his bottle and the tradesman who endeavours to make business and plea∣sure compatible will never be able to make both ends meet Thus whether health fame or interest is regarded Drunken∣ness should be avoided and we may say with  Cassio  "Every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a Devil"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XCIII THURSDAY  November    Fortuna saevo laeta negotio et  Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax  HOR  I  CANNOT but admire the ingenious device prefixed to the advertisements of  Hazard  's LotteryOffice in which Fortune is repre∣sented hovering over the heads of a number of people and scattering down all kinds of Prizes among them What Mr  Hazard  has here delineated every adventurer in the late Lottery had pictured to himself the ten thousand constantly floated before his eyes and each person had already possessed it in imagination But alas all our expectations are now at an end the golden dream is at length vanished and those who were kept giddy all the while that the wheel of For∣tune  was turning round have now leisure soberly to reflect on their disappointment How many unhappy tradesmen must now trudge on foot all their lives who designed to loll in their chariots how many poor maidens of good family but no fortune must languish all their days with∣out the comforts of an husband and a coach and fix Every loser thinks himself ill used by Fortune and even Mrs  Betty  the possessor of a single sixteenth flies to the Office pays her penny and receives the tidings of her ill luck with surprize goes to another Office pays her penny hears the same disagreeable information and can hardly very hardly persuade herself that Fortune should have doom∣ed her still to wash the dishes and scrub down the stairs  THUS the views of every adventurer are directed to the same point though their motives for engaging in the Lot∣tery may be different One man puts in because he is willing to be in Fortune's way another because he had good luck in the last and another because he never got any thing before This indulges in the prospect of making a fortune and that buoys himself up with the hopes of retrieving his desperate circumstances Every one however thinks himself as sure of the ten thousand as if he had it in his pocket and his only concern is how to dispose of it In this light we may consider every adventurer as having been in actual possession of this treasure and out of fifty thousand people who have been blest within this fortnight with such ideal good fortune I shall select the fol∣lowing instances which fell within my own notice  JOSEPH WILKINS of  Thames Street  Esquire Oilman and Cheesemonger got the l He could not bear  the foggy air and dingy situation of the City he therefore resolved to take an house at the St  James  's end of the town and intended to fit up a snug box at  Hampstead  in the  Chinese  taste for his retirement on Sundays A Chariot was absolutely necessary to carry him to and from  'Change  every morning but he designed to have it made accord∣ing to the modern fashion that it might occasionally be con∣verted into a PostChaise to wheel him on a Saturday night to his Countryseat and back again on the Monday morning Nothing was now wanting but a careful plod∣ding partner who should take upon himself the whole drudgery of the shop so that the Squire might have no farther trouble than to receive his dividend of the profits But while he was considering on whom this important favour should be conferred his ticket was drawnblank and Squire  Wilkins  is contented with his greasy employment of measuring out lampoil and cutting out pennyworths of  Cheshire  Cheese  JOHN JONES of  Ludlow  in the county of  Salop  Esquire Dealer and Chapman got the l This gentleman was forewarned of his success by several undeniable to∣kens His lady had dreamt of a  particular Number  four nights together and while the bells were ringing upon his being chose Bailiff of the Corporation they spoke in as plain words as ever  Whittington  heard  "  Mr John Jones will get ten thousand poundMr John Jones will get ten thousand pound  "  He and his lady therefore came up to  London  and not being able to meet with the  particular Number  at  Hazard  's or  Wilson  's or any other Office always remarkable for selling the ten thousands they advertized it  in the papers and got the great Prize for only paying a guinea more for their ticket than the marketprice As Mrs  Jones  knew a good deal of the world having lived for some years in quality of an upper servant in a great house she was determined that Mr  Jones  should take the opportunity now they were in town of learning how to behave himself as he should do when he came to his fortune She therefore introduced him into the best com∣pany in all the housekeepers and stewards rooms in the best families where she was acquainted and as Mr  Jones  was so deficient in politeness as not even to know how to make a bow in coming into a room he had private lessons from Mr  Dukes  who undertakes to teach Grown Gentle∣men to dance Mrs  Jones  herself was very busy in con∣sulting with the milliner and mantuamaker about the newest fashions when the long lookedfor ten thousand came up and directly after the  HeyGeHo  carried them down again to  Salop  with this only consolation that their ticket was within one of the fortunate Number  JONATHAN WILDGOOSE of  Cheapside  Silk Mercer had too much taste to be confined to dirty business which he neglected for the more agreeable persuits of pleasure Having therefore met with great losses in trade he was obliged to embark the remains of his shattered fortune in the Lottery and by purchasing a number of tickets secured to himself the l He had determined to keep his success secret bilk his creditors by becoming bankrupt turn the whole into an annuity for his life and live abroad like a gentleman upon the income But unluckily his creditors came upon him too quickly and before he could know that he had  not  got the ten thousand hurried him  to jail where he now lies lamenting that the  Act of Insol∣vency  was not postponed 'till after the Lottery  SIR HUMPHRY OLDCASTLE having greatly dipt his estate by being chosen into Parliament on the Tory interest mortgaged all he had left to put himself in the way of the the l for the good of his country This seasonable recruit fixed him a staunch patriot and he declared he would stand another election against all oppositions But however it happened the finishing of the lottery has induced him to change his sentiments and Sir  Humphry  in lieu of the l has accepted a place  JEMMY LISTER an Attorney's Clerk was carried into the Lottery by pure disinterested love He had conceived a violent passion for his master's daughter but the prudent old gentleman could not be prevailed on to give her away to an handsome young fellow without a penny This enra∣ged him so much that he was in doubt whether he should bestow his l on the young lady or employ it more fashionably in keeping a girl However his hopes soon sunk to one of the l prizes which he at once deter∣mined to settle upon her together with his person But in this too he was disappointed as also of the other inferior prizes and having received a positive refusal from his mistress out of mere spite he directly married the maid  CAPTAIN MAC MULLEN a decayed Gamester made a shift to purchase the  Chance  of a Ticket which came up l He immediately flew to  Arthur  's late  White  's risked it all at Hazard set the whole table and stript the company of their last shilling After this he bought runninghorses made matches carried off the best plates and took in all the KnowingOnes on the Turf But so fluctuating is the situation of a Gamester that at the end of the Lottery  he found that Fortune had left him in the lurch without so much as a groat to buy an halter  Et frustrà mortis cupidum cùm deerit egenti  As laquei pretium  HOR  I NEED not point out any particular instances among the other sex with respect to their disposal of the l which every lady had secured by chusing the ticket herself taking particular care that the number be an odd one The married ladies have sufficient calls for even double this sum to supply them with the necessaries of dress and to answer the expences of frequenting public diversions and as to the unmarried ladies they very well know the truth of that maxim in the ballad that  "in ten thousand pounds ten thousand charms are center'd"  Some ancient maiden ladies who could never be brought to think of an husband or to give into the vanities of the world were resolved to live retired upon their Prize in the country and leave proofs of their good dispositions behind them by swelling out their Wills with a long list of  Items  to this or that charity or hospital  BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of the great generosity of my own PUBLISHER upon getting the l As his success was owing to his laying out in the Lottery all the profits which had already risen from the publication of this Paper he had determined to circulate my future numbers  gratis  and had even designed to keep open house for the re∣ception of poor authors Unhappily for the public as well as my brotherwriters Fortune has frustrated his disinterested scheme Even I myself am admitted to eat his mutton but once a week and instead of giving away my papers he has advertised that the  Twelves  edition of the CONNOISSEUR will be published on  Tuesday  the th of this instant  No∣vember  in  Two Pocket Volumes Price  Six Shillings  bound  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XCIV THURSDAY  November    Militavi non sine gloriâ  HOR  A  S I was going through  Smithfield  the other day I observed an old fellow with a wooden leg drest in a sailor's habit who courte∣ously invited the passerby to peep into his rareeshow for the small price of an half∣penny His exhibitions I found were very well suited to the times and quite in character for himself for among other particulars with which he amused the little audience of children that surrounded his box I was mightily pleased to hear the following  "there you see the  British  fleet persuing the  French  ships which are running awaythere you see MajorGeneral  Johnson  beating the  French  soldiers in  America  and taking Count  Dieskau  pri∣sonerthere you see the  Grand Monarque  upon his  knees before King  George  begging his life"  As the thoughts of the public are now wholly turned upon war it is no wonder that every method is taken to inspire us with a love of our country and an abhorrence of the  French  king and not only the old seaman with his rareeshow but the public theatres have likewise had a view to the same point At  DruryLane  we have already been enter∣tained with the  Humours of the Navy  and I am assured that at  CoventGarden  Mr  Barry  will make an entire con∣quest of  France  in the person of that renowned hero  Henry the fifth  And as the  English  are naturally fond of bloody exhibitions on the stage I am told that a new Pantomime entitled the  Ohio  is preparing at this last house more terrible than any of it's  Hells Devils  and  fiery Dragons  in which will be introduced the  Indian Manner of Fighting  to conclude with a representation of the Grand  Scalping Dance with all its Horrors  WHILE this warlike disposition prevails in the nation I am under some apprehensions lest the attention of the public should be called off from the weighty concerns of these papers I already perceive that the common news∣papers are more eagerly snatched up in the public coffeehouses than my essays and the  Gazette  is much oftener called for than the  Connoisseur  For these reasons I find it necessary to lay open my own importance before the public to shew that I myself am acting as it were in a military capacity and that CensorGeneral TOWN has done his country no less service as a valiant and skilful com∣mander at home than MajorGeneral  Johnson  in  America  Authors may very properly be said to be engaged in a state of literary warfare many of whom are taken into  pay by those great and mighty potentates the booksellers and it will be allowed that they undergo no less hardships in the service than the common soldiers who are contented to be shot at for a groat a day  IT has been my province to repell the daily inroads and encroachments made by vice and folly and to guard the nation from an invasion of foreign fopperies and  French  fashions The town has been principally the scene of action where I have found enemies to encounter with no less formidable than the  Tquattotquaws  or the  Chickchimuckchis  of  NorthAmerica  But as the curiosity of the public is so much engaged in attending to the enterprizes of Old  Hendrick  the  Sachem  and the incursions of  Indians  who have taken up the hatchet against our Colonies I am afraid that my exploits against the Savages which infest this metropolis will be wholly overlooked I have therefore resolved to give my readers fresh advices from time to time of what passes here drawn up in the same warlike stile and manner as those very alarming articles of news which are commonly to be met with in our public papers  WE hear from  White  's that the forces under Major General  Hoyle  which used to encamp at that place are removed from thence and have fixed their winter quarters at  Arthur  's The same letters say that an obstinate engage∣ment was fought there a few nights ago in which one party gained a great booty and the other suffered a consi∣derable loss We are also informed that an epidemical distemper rages among them and that several of the chiefs have been carried off by a sudden death  THEY write from  CoventGarden  that last week a Body of  Irregulars  sallied out at midnight stormed several forts in that neighbourhood and committed great outrages but being attacked by a detachment from the allied army of watchmen constables and justices they were put to flight and several of them taken prisoners The plague still rages there with great violence as well as in the neigh∣bouring territories of  Drury  WE hear from the same place that the  Company  com∣manded by Brigadier  Rich  has been reinforced with several newraised recruits to supply the place of some deserters who had gone over to the enemy but his chief dependance is on the lightarmed troops which are very active and are distinguished like the  Highlanders  by their partycoloured dress The enemy on the other hand have taken several  Swiss  and  Germans  into pay though they were at first under terrible apprehensions of their being set upon by the  Critics  These are a rude ignorant savage people who are always at war with the nation of  Authors  Their constant manner of fighting is to begin the onset with strange hissings and noises accompanied with an horrid instrument named the  Catcall  which like the  Warhoop  of the  Indians  has struck a panic into the hearts of the stoutest heroes  WE have advice from the  Butcher Row  that on monday night last the  Infidels  held a grand Council of war at their head quarters in the  Robin Hood  at which their good friend and ally the  Mufti  of  Claremarket  assisted in person After many debates they resolved to declare war against the  Christians  and never to make peace till they had pulled  down all the Churches in  Christendom  and established the  Alcoran  of  Bolingbroke  in lieu of the Bible  ALL our advices from the City of  London  agree in their accounts of the great havock and slaughter made there on the Festival commonly called  My Lord Mayor's Day  All the  Companies  in their black uniform and the trained bands in their regimentals made a general forage They carried off vast quantities of chickens geese ducks and all kinds of provisions Major  Guzzledown  of  Bassishaw  distinguished himself greatly having with sword in hand gallantly attacked the outworks scaled the walls mounted the ramparts and forced through the covertway of a large fortified Custard which seemed impregnable  THE Inhabitants of  Sussex  have lately been alarmed with the apprehensions of an Invasion as the  French  have been very busy in fitting out several small vessels laden with stores of wine and brandy with which it is thought they will attempt to make a descent somewhere on our coasts The Independant Companies of  Smugglers  in the service of  France  are to be sent on this expedition but if the fleet of Customhouse smacks c do not intercept them at sea we are preparing to receive them as soon as they are landed  FROM divers parts of the country we have advice that the roads are every where crowded with Ladies who not∣withstanding the severity of the weather are hurrying up to  London  to be present at the meeting of the  Female Parli∣ament  At this critical juncture the fate of the nation de∣pends entirely on the deliberations of this wise and august Assembly and as there are known to be many disinterested  patriots in the House it is not to be doubted but that proper measures will be persued for the good of their country Many salutary laws are already talked of which we could wish to see put in execution such asA Bill for prohibiting the importation of  French  Milliners Hair∣cutters and MantuamakersA Bill for the exportation of  French  Cooks and  French  Valets de ChambresA Bill to restrain Ladies from wearing  French Dresses  And lastly a Bill to restrain them from wearing  French Faces  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XCV THURSDAY  November    Melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam  Objicit  VIRG  A  S every marriage is a kind of family festival the weddingday is honoured with various celebrities and distinguished like the fifth of  November  the birthdays of the Royal Family or any other public day with many demonstrations of joy The happy couple are drest in their richest suits the bells ring all day and the evening is con∣cluded with the merry ceremony of throwing the Stocking But these festivities are not always so religiously observed in Town where many a pair of quality are tacked together with the utmost privacy and immediately after sneak out of town as if they were ashamed to shew their faces after what they had done In the Country when the squire or  any other person of distinction is married the HoneyMoon is almost a continued Carnival and every marriage is ac∣counted more or less likely to be prosperous in proportion to the number of deer oxen and sheep that are killed on the occasion and the hogsheads of wine and tuns of ale with which they are washed down By the last post I received an account from my Cousin VILLAGE of the wedding of a near relation with a particular detail of the magnificence of the entertainment the splendor of the ball and the uni∣versal joy of the whole manour At the same time I received compliments from the newmarried couple with a large slice of the BRIDECAKE the virtues of which are well known to every girl of thirteen I was never in pos∣session of this nuptial charm before but I was so much delighted with this matrimonial token and it excited in my mind so many reflections on conjugal happiness that though I did not lay it under my pillow it gave oc∣casion to the following Dream  I FOUND myself in the middle of a spacious building which was crouded with a variety of persons of both sexes and upon enquiry was told that it was the Temple of the God of Marriage and that every one who had an incli∣nation to sacrifice to that Deity was invited to approach a large altar which was covered with a great number of CAKES of different shapes and appearance Some of these were moulded into the form of hearts and others were woven into trueloversknots some were strewed with sugar and stuck about with sweetmeats some were covered with gold some were stamped with coronets and others had their tops embellished with glittering toys that represented a fine house a set of jewels a coach and  six or the like  Plutus  and  Cupid  were busily employed in distributing these Cakes which were all of them marked with the word MATRIMONY and called BRIDECAKES to different persons who were allowed to chuse for them∣selves according to their different views and inclinations  I OBSERVED several hasten to the altar who all appeared to be differently affected by their choice To some the Cakes seemed of so delicious a flavour that they imagined they should never be surfeited while others who found the taste very agreeable at first in a short time declared it to be flat and insipid However I could not help remark∣ing that many more particularly among the quality ad∣dressed themselves to  Plutus  than to  Cupid  BEING desirous to take a nearer view of the company I pushed through the croud and placed myself close by the altar A young couple now advanced and applying to  Cupid  desired him to reach them one of the Cakes in the shape of a double heart pearced through with darts but just as they were going to share it betwixt them a crabbed old fellow whom I found to be the girl's father stepped up broke the cake in two and obliged the young lady to fix upon another which  Plutus  picked out for her and which represented the figure of a fine gentleman in gilt gingerbread  AN old fellow of sixtytwo who had stolen one day from the business of the  'Change  and the  Alley  next came towards the altar and seemed to express a strong desire for a Cake  Plutus  who recollected him at first sight immedi∣ately offered him one which though very mouldy and  coarse was gilt all over but he was astonished at the old gentleman's refusing it and petitioning  Cupid  for a Cake of the most elegant form and sweetest ingredients of any on the altar The little God at first repulsed him with indig∣nation but afterwards  sold  it to him for a large sum of money a circumstance which amazed me beyond expres∣sion but which I soon found was very commonly practised in this Temple The old fellow retired with his purchased prize and though I imagined he might still have a colt's tooth remaining after having for some time mumbled it be∣tween his old gums in vain it lay by him untouched and unenjoyed  I WAS afterwards very much disgusted with the many instances that occurred of these delicate morsels being set up to sale and I found that their price rose and fell like that of beef or mutton according to the glut or scarcity of the market I was particularly affected with the disposal of the two following A young gentleman and lady were ap∣proaching the altar and had agreed to take between them a Cake of a plain form but delicious flavour marked  Love and Competence  but a person of quality stepping forward persuaded the false female to join with him and receive from  Plutus  a glittering dainty marked  Indifference and a large Settlement  Another lady was coming up with a Knight of the Bath being tempted by a Cake with a red ribbon streaming from it like the flags on a TwelfthCake but was prevailed on by a person of greater rank and dis∣tinction to accept a more showy Cake adorned with a blue ribbon and a coronet  A BUXOM dame of an amourous complexion came next and begged very hard for a Cake She had before received  several which suited her tooth and pleased her palate so excessively that as soon as she had dispatched one she constantly came to  Cupid  for another She now seized her Cake with great transport and retiring to a corner with it I could discern her greedily mumbling the delicious morsel though she had fairly worn out six and twenty of her teeth in the service After this an ancient lady came tottering up to the altar supported by a young fellow in a red coat with a shoulderknot  Plutus  gave him a stale Cake marked with the word JOINTURE in large golden capitals which he received with some reluctance while the old lady eagerly snatched another from  Cupid  who turned his head aside from her on which I could plainly discover the word DOTAGE  A RICH rusty batchelor of the last century then came bustling through the croud He brought with him a red∣cheeked country girl of nineteen As he approached the altar he met several coming from it with Cakes which he had refused some of which were marked  Riches  some  Family  some  Beauty  and one or two  Affection  The girl he brought with him proved to be his dairymaid whom he had for some time past been in vain attempting to bring over to his wishes but at last finding his design impracticable he came with her to the altar He seemed indeed a little ashamed of his undertaking and betrayed a good deal of aukwardness in his manner and deportment However as soon as he had taken his Cake he retired and determined to spend the rest of his days with his milchcow in the country  TO satisfy a modest longing there now advanced a mai∣den lady in the bloom of threescore She had it seems heretofore refused several offers from  Cupid  and  Plutus  but  being enraged to find that they had now given over all thoughts of her she seized by the hand a young Ensign of the Guards and carried him to the altar whence she her∣self snatched up a Cake and divided it with her gallant She was highly delighted with the taste of it at first but her partner being very soon cloyed she too late discovered that the half which she held in her hand was signed  Folly  and that which she had forced upon her paramour was marked  Aversion  A LITTLE pert forward Miss in a frock and hanging sleeves briskly ran up to  Cupid  and begged for a Cake what it was she did not care but a Cake she must and would have of one kind or another She had just stretched out her hand to receive one from  Cupid  when her mamma interposed sent the child back again blubbering to the boardingschool and carried off the Cake herself  AN old woman fantastically drest then burst into the Temple and run raving up to the altar crying out that her name was MARY SINGLETON and she would have an hus∣band But the poor lady seemed likely to be disappointed for as she could prevail on no one to join hands with her both  Cupid  and  Plutus  refused to favour her with a Cake Furious with rage and despair she snatched one off the altar and seizing on the first man that came in her way which unfortunately happened to be myself she would have crammed it forcibly down my throat As the least crumb of it was as disagreeable as a drench to an horse I began to spawl and sputter and keck and though the flurry of spirits which it occasioned awaked me I thought I had the nauseous taste of it still in my mouth  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN

pater chartae  Mercare tales ab eo nec sciet quisquam  MART  To Mr TOWN  SIR  A  MONG the many  Register Offices  erected within these few years past I am surprized that no scheme of the like nature has been thought of for the service of literature and that no place has been set apart where Literary Commodities of every sort might be disposed of where men of learning might meet with employment and where others who want their assistance might be sure to  meet with men of learning There is nothing of this kind in being at present except among the booksellers who have made a monopoly of the trade and engrossed the whole market to themselves To remedy this inconvenience my design is to set up a LITERARY REGISTER OFFICE for which purpose I intend to hire the now useless theatre in  Lincolns Inn Fields  and convert it into a mart for the staple commodities of the literary commonwealth I shall here fit up apartments for the reception of my authors who will be employed from time to time in supplying the public with the requisite manufactures This scheme will I doubt not meet with great encouragement as it is of general utility and I do not remember any design of the same nature except at a barber's on the other side the water who has hung out a board over his shop with the following in∣scription  Letters read and written for Servants and others  I SHALL always have a fresh assortment of goods in the best taste and newest fashion as of Novels for example while the humour of reading them is prevalent among all ranks of people For this branch I shall retain a very emi∣nent masternovellist to cut out adventures and intrigues and shall employ a proper number of hands to finish the work with all possible care and expedition and if any ladies of quality or others chuse to furnish their own materials for Memoirs and Apologies they may have them done up and be fitted exactly at my Office Besides several others which my men shall get up with the greatest dispatch I can assure you I have myself worked night and day and have already finished six and thirty sheets of the History of Miss  Sukey Sapling  Written by Herself  PAMPHLETS of all sorts shall be composed whenever any popular subject starts up that is likely to engage the attention of the public Every new play shall be followed by an  Examen  or  Remarks  all riots at either playhouse will afford scope for  Letters to the Managers  and every new actor or actress produce theatrical criticisms Poetry you know Mr TOWN is a mere drug but I shall always have a number of readymade Odes by me which may be suited to any Great Man dead or alive in place or out of place I shall also have a large bundle of  Poems on several Occasions  very proper for any gentleman or lady who chuses to publish by subscription besides a more ordinary sort of Hymns to the Morning Verses on the Death of Odes to Miss  A B C  Acrostics and Re∣busses for the use of the Magazines to be sold a penny∣worth with allowance to those who take a great quantity  WITH regard to Law matters as they have no sort of connexion with wit or learning I shall not concern myself with their unintelligible jargon nor presume to interfere with those authors in parchment who measure their words by the footrule and sell their writings at so much  per  line How∣ever I shall furnish young Students of the several Inns of Court with complete Canons of Criticism and Opinions on any new theatrical Cases on which they may argue very learnedly at a tavern or plead at the bar of a coffeehouse For Medical subjects I shall procure a learned Graduate by  Diploma  from abroad whose practice will not so much take up his time as to prevent his being at leisure to write oc∣casional treatises setting forth the virtues of any newlyinvented Powder or newlydiscovered Water He shall also draw up the advertisements for medicines that remove  all diseases and are never known to fail he shall compile the wonderful accounts of their surprising cures and fur∣nish cases that never happened and affidavits that were never made With respect to Divinity as I have reason to believe that controversial writings will be often called for I intend to bargain with the  Robin Hood  Society to undertake in the lump to furnish my Office with Defences of Lord  Bo∣lingbroke  c and till I can procure some poor curate out of the country or servitor from the university to write the  Manuscript Sermons of eminent Divines lately deceased war∣ranted originals  I must make shift with the  Fleet Parsons  now out of business  THOUGH I shall not keep any dramatic works ready made by me as these commodities are apt to grow stale and out of fashion yet either of the theatres may be served with tragedy comedy farce or the like by bespeaking them and giving but three days notice For the comic pieces I shall employ a poet who has long worked for the drolls at  Bar∣tholomew  and  Southwark  fairs and has printed a comedy as it was  half  acted at  DruryLane  My tragedies will be furnished by a  North Briton  who walked up to  London  from his native country last winter with a most sublime tragedy in his coatpocket and which is now to be disposed of to the best bidder Any old play of  Shakespeare  or  Ben Johnson  shall be pieced with modern ones according to the present taste or cut out in airs and recitative for an  English Opera

Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER XCVII THURSDAY  December    De te pendentis te respicientis amici  HOR  I  REMEMBER to have heard a cousin of mine who was formerly at  Cambridge  often men∣tion a sect of Philosophers distinguished by the rest of the collegians by the appellation of  TuftHunters  These were not the disciples of the  Stoics  or  Epicureans  or the advocates for the old or new philosophy but the followers literally speaking of the fellowcommoners noblemen and other rich students whom it seems the courtesy of the Univer∣sity has honoured with a cap adorned with a gold tossel These few gold threads have almost as much influence in the University as a red or blue ribband at court and always draw after the wearer a train of humble companions who  will be at his call to breakfast dine or sup with him whenever he pleases will go with him any where drink with him wench with him borrow his money or let him pay their reckoning They are I am told a sort of disease of the place which a man of fortune is sure to catch as soon as he arrives there and these fast friends stick so close to him that he can never shake them off while he keeps his gown on his back  THE University of  London  is not without its  TuftHunters  who fasten like leeches on a young man of fortune at his first coming to town They beset him as soon as he arrives and when they have once surrounded him seldom fail of se∣curing him to themselves for no persons of character care to have any connections with him when he has been fre∣quently seen in such bad company It is a great misfortune for any young gentleman to fall into their hands though indeed as a fool is the natural prey of knaves the wealthy maintainers of this fraternity are generally none of the wi∣sest And as at the University  "where the learned pate ducks to the golden fool"  the gentlemanstudent is distinguished by a cap with a gold tuft I always consider these sons of folly in town as adorned with a showy cap hung with bells which serve at once to denote the depth of their parts and to call their train about them  THE dialect of the town has very expressively charac∣terised these humble dependants on men of fortune by the name of  Hangerson  They will indeed take such sure hold and hang on a man so constantly that it is almost im∣possible to drop them Whenever the gentleman appears the  Hangeron  is sure to be at his elbow They will squeeze  themselves into every party that is formed and I have known instances of their thrusting themselves into strange families by sticking to their patron's skirts and impu∣dently introducing themselves where he has been invited to dinner which indeed I think would not be an im∣proper custom provided they would submit to stand behind his chair They will stick so closely that all the adhesive quality of burs pitch c seem to be collected in them and the line in  Pope  's  Odyssey  so often ridiculed may rather be considered as emphasis than tautology in speaking of Them The  Hangeron  clings to his fool as  Ulysses  did to the rock and in  Pope  's words  They STICK ADHERENT and SUSPENDED HANG  THE tenaciousness of a  Hangeron  is so very strong that whoever is drawn into their snares is so firmly limed he can hardly ever loose himself from them For as nothing but the lowest meanness of spirit could ever prevail on a man to submit to such dependance on another it is in vain to think of getting rid of such abject wretches by treating them with contempt They will take as much beating provided you will allow them an equal degree of familiarity as a spaniel They will also submit to do any little offices and are glad to make themselves useful whenever they have an opportunity They will go among the brokers to borrow money for you pimp for you or submit to any other such gentlemanlike employment to serve their friend  IT must here be noted that every  Hangeron  is a person of strict honour and a gentleman for though his fortune is to be sure somewhat inferior to yours and he submits to  make himself convenient on several occasions yet on that account you are indebted to his infinite goodnature and all his endeavours to serve you proceed from his great friend∣ship and regard for you I remember one of these friendly gentlemen who carried his esteem so far that in a quarrel with his rich companion in which he was favoured with several tweaks by the nose and kicks on the breech he received all these injuries with patience and only said with tears in his eyes  "Dear  Jack  I never expected this usage from you You know I don't mind fighting but I should never have a moment's peace if I was to do you the least injury Come  Jack  let us buss and be friends"  Their gentility is unquestionable for they are seldom of any trade though they are sometimes being youngerbrothers perhaps of a profession I know one who is a nominal lawyer but though his friend has often fee'd him our Counsellor could never with any propriety con∣sider him as a client and I know another who like  Gibbet  in the play is called Captain whose elegant manner of living must be supported by his being on full pay with his patron since he does not receive even the common soldier's groat a day from his commission However con∣sidering at one view the gentility of their profession and the shortness of their finances I often look on them as a band of decayed gentlemen the honourable pensioners of those they follow The great men among the  Romans  had a number of these  Hangerson  which attended them whereever they went and were emphatically called  Umbrae  or  Shadows  and indeed this appellation conveys a very full idea of the nature of these humble retainers to the wealthy since they not only follow them like their shadows but  "like a shadow prove the substance true"  for whenever  you observe one or more of these  Umbrae  perpetually at the heels of any gentleman you may fairly conclude him to be a man of fortune  THESE faithful friends are so careful of every thing that concerns you that they always enquire with the greatest exactness into your affairs and know almost as well as your steward the income of your estate They are also so fond of your company and so desirous of preserving your good opi∣nion that a  Hangeron  will take as much pains to keep you entirely to himself and to prevent a rival in your af∣fections as a mistress and as a convenient female is a very necessary part of the equipage of a person of fashion these male companions must be a very agreeable part of the retinue of those highspirited young gentlemen who are fond of being the head of their company It is only a more refined taste in expence to pay a man for laughing at your wit and in∣dulging your humour and who will either drink his bottle with you at the tavern or run to the end of the town for you on an errand  I MIGHT also take notice of an humbler sort of  Hangerson  who fix themselves to no one particular but fasten upon all their friends in their turns Their views indeed are seldom extended beyond a present subsistence and their utmost aim perhaps is to get a dinner For this purpose they keep a register of the hours of dining of all their acquaintance and though they contrive to call in upon you just as you are sitting down to table they are always with much difficulty prevailed upon to take a chair If you dine abroad or are gone into the country they will eat with your family to prevent their being melancholy on account  of your absence or if your family is out they will break∣fast dine and sup with you out of charity because you should not be alone Every house is haunted with these disturbers of our meals and perhaps the best way to get rid of them would be to put them with the rest of your servants upon boardwages  BUT besides these danglers after men of fortune and in∣truders on your table in town the country breeds a race of lowly retainers which may properly be ranked among the same species Almost every family supports a poor kinsman who happening to be no way related to the estate was too proud of his blood to apply himself in his youth to any profession and rather chose to be supported in laziness at the familyseat They are indeed known perhaps to be cou∣sins to the squire but do not appear in a more creditable light than his servants out of livery and sometimes actually submit to as mean offices of drudgery as the groom or whipperin The whole fraternity of  Hangerson  whether in town or country or under whatever denomination are the sons of idleness for it will be found upon examina∣tion that whenever a man whose bread depends on his industry gives himself up to indolence he becomes capable of any meanness whatever and if  they cannot dig  yet like our  Hangerson to beg they are not ashamed  This Day is Published  In Two Neat Pocket Volumes Price Six Shillings bound  The CONNOISSEUR revised and corrected  With a new Translation of the  Mottos  and  Quotations  THE

assentando indulgendo et largiendo  TER  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  HAVE been some years married to one of the best women in the world She possesses all the virtues that can be named but alas she possesses some of them to excess Those which I wish to particularize and which are infinitely pernicious to me and my fortunes are her superabundant Goodnature and her boundless Generosity  IT is a little difficult perhaps to ascertain what are or ought to be the exact bounds of Goodnature which of all virtues seems to me most necessary to be confined or at least mitigated in such a manner as to hinder it from de∣stroying  its own excellence and utility On the one hand if it is restrained too close the world will say that it must entirely lose its essence But fatal experience has convinced me that if it is permitted to enjoy a full unlimited sway this amiable virtue becomes a ridiculous vice and brings with it as in my wife's case fruitless expences illjudged concessions and a kind of blind folly that is always liable to contempt  GENEROSITY is the daughter of Goodnature She is very fair and lovely when under the tuition of Judgment and Reason but when she escapes from her tutors and acts in∣discriminately according as her fancy allures her she subjects herself like her mother to the blasts of sneer ridicule and disdain  TO illustrate these assertions by some examples from among the many mishaps losses and embarassments which have accrued to us in the course of our domestic affairs give me leave to tell you that some years ago we had a footboy who acted as butler and had the custody of all the little plate which our small fortune could afford us The fellow was aukward and unfit for the station but my wife very goodnaturedly was determined to keep him in our ser∣vice because he intended to marry the nurserymaid and would undoubtedly make an excellent husband The rascal was a thief but as it is illnatured to suspect people before we have full proof of their knavery several of his tricks and petty larcenies were attributed to the itinerant Jews and higlers we then living at  Newington  who frequently called at our door Flushed with success and relying on my wife's credulity and Goodnature he began to form deeper designs and as he lay in the kitchen pretended to have seen a man breaking in at the window and to have hid himself with a chopping knife in his hand so as to have felled the villain to the ground as soon as he had put his body through the case∣ment  A noise from without was said to have given an alarm to the housebreaker and to have interrupted him in his at∣tempt but some whole panes of glass being dislocated from their lead and some hacks and scratches of a chisel marks all made by our own servant being visible next morning my wife very generously  rewarded  her  Jemmy  whom she jocularly called  Scrub  for his diligence and courage in defending us from having our throats cut This terrible tale was doubtless formed in order to remove all suspicions when he should pillage the house himself but precautions being taken by us in consequence of this alarm to fortify our bedchamber where he knew our current treasure was reposited  Jemmy  thought it time to decamp so that in about a week after he had received the reward I hinted at of a crown piece from his lady he stole her gold repeating watch and a pair of our best silver candlesticks with which he voluntarily tran∣sported himself as we have been since told to the  WestIn∣dies  leaving his mistress the nurserymaid big with child and thereby giving great licence to the neighbourhood to animadvert upon my wife's amazing prescience in foreseeing his excellencies as an husband  YOU must further be told Sir that my dear consort in the full glow of her goodness is never contented unless her servants marry each other All I can urge against so impo∣litic a custom has been to no purpose Marriage she says prevents vice and saves souls from destruction Perhaps it may but are no unmarried servants to be found in Mr  Fielding  's Register Office or elsewhere but what are vicious At least I am sure that this piece of sanctity is very expensive in its effects and is attended with many inconve∣niences One of her maids about two years ago was disco∣vered to be very intimate with my footman my wife to prevent ill consequences hastened to have them married and was present herself at the ceremony She admired the mo∣desty of the woman and the decent gravity of the man during  the holy rites and she was entirely convinced that no harm could have happened from so decent a couple In little more than three months after the marriage  Patty  brought forth a swinging girl but as it was born almost six months before its time my wife advised them to keep it the remain∣ing half year in cotton She did this purely from a motive of goodnature to try to shield the new married woman's re∣putation but finding our neighbours fleer at the incident and smile contemptuously at the prescription of cotton she contented herself in believing  Patty  's own account that  "in truth she had been married eight months before by a  Fleetparson  but was afraid to own it"  BUT if my wife's indulging her domestics in matrimony was productive of no other ill consequence than merely their being married it might indeed sometimes rather prove a bene∣fit than a detriment but the chaster and more sober they have been before marriage the greater number of children are pro∣duced in matrimony and my wife looks upon herself as in duty obliged to take care of the poor helpless offspring that have been begotten under her own roof so that I assure you Sir my house is so well filled with children that it would put you immediately in mind of the  Foundling Hos∣pital  with this difference however that in  my Hospital  not only the children are provided for whether bastards or legi∣timate but also the fathers and mothers  YOUR high office Mr CENSOR requires and leads you to hear domestic occurrences otherwise I should scarce have troubled you with the records of a private family almost ruined by excrescencies of virtue The same overflowing humanity runs through the whole conduct of the dear wo∣man whom I have mentioned Even in trifles she is full of works of supererogation Our doors are perpetually sur∣rounded with beggars where the halt the maimed and the blind assemble in as great numbers as at the door of the  Roman  Catholic Chapel in  Lincoln's InnFields  She not only gives them money but sends them out great quantities of bread beer and cold victuals and she has her different  pensioners  as she herself calls them for every day in the week But the expence attending these outdoor petitioners many of whom have from time to time been discovered to be im∣postors is nothing in comparison to the sums that are almost daily drawn from her by begging letters It is impossible to imagine a calamity by which she has not been a sufferer in relieving those who have extorted money from her by pretended misfortunes The poor lady has been much hurt by losses in trade has been a great sufferer by fire under∣gone many hardships from sickness and other unforeseen ac∣cidents and it was but yesterday that she paid a long apothe∣cary's bill brought on by a violent fever Thus Sir though my wife goes into but little company and the familyexpences are to all appearance very small yet my wife's superabundant Goodnature is such perpetual drawback on her oeconomy that we run out considerably This extravagant and illjudged Generosity renders all her numerous excellencies of none effect and I have often known her almost destitute of cloaths because she had distributed her whole wardrobe among lyars sycophants and hypocrites  THUS Sir as briefly as I can I have set before you my un∣happy case I am perishing by degrees not by any real extravagance any designed ruin or any indulgence of luxury and riot in the person who destroys me On the contrary no woman can exceed my wife in the simplicity of her dress the humility of her desires or the contented easiness of her nature What name Sir shall I give to my misfortunes They proceed not from vice nor even from folly they proceed from too tender a heart a heart that hurries away or absorbs all judgment and reflection To call these errors the fruits of Goodnature is too mild a definition  and yet to give them an harsher appellation is unkind Let me suffer what I will I must kiss the dear hand that ruins me  IN my tender hours of speculation I would willingly im∣pute my wife's faults to our climate and the natural dis∣position of our natives When the  English  are Goodnatured they are generally so to excess and as I have not seen this particular character delineated in any of your papers I have endeavoured to paint it myself and shall draw to the conclusion of my letter by one piece of ad∣vice  Not to be  GENEROUS  overmuch  The highest acts of Generosity are seldom repaid in any other coin but base∣ness and ingratitude and we ought ever to remember that out of ten lepers cleaned one only came back to return thanks the rest were made whole

Da veniam servire tuis quòd nolo Calendis  MART  To Mr TOWN  SIR  A  T this season of the year while the streets resound with the cry of  New Almanacks  and every stall is covered with News from the Stars Diaries Predictions Complete Ephemeris c drawn up by  Partridge Parker Vincent Wing  and the rest of the sagacious body of Philomaths and Astrologers give me leave to acquaint you of my intentions of appearing annually in a like capacity You must know Sir that having observed that among the great variety of Almanacks now published there is not one contrived for the use of people of fashion I have resolved to remedy this defect by publishing one every year  under the title of the  Court Calendar  calculated for the Meridian of St  James  's  THE plan which has been hitherto followed by our Almanackmakers can be of no use whatever to the polite world who are as widely separated in their manner of living from the common herd of people as the inhabitants of the  Antipodes  To know the exact Rising and Setting of the Sun may serve to direct the vulgar tradesman and mechanic when to open shop or go to work but persons of fashion whose hours are not marked by the course of that planet are indifferent about its motions and like those who live under the Equinoctial Line have their days and nights of an equal degree of length all the year round The Redletter days pointed out in our common Almanacks may perhaps be observed by some formal ladies who regulate their going to church by them but people of quality percieve no difference between the Moveable or Immoveable Feasts and Fasts and know no use of Sunday but as it serves to call them to the cardtable What advantage can a beau reap from  Rider  's List of the Fairs which can only be of service to his groom or what use can any gentleman or lady make of those Diaries now inscribed to them which are filled with Algebra and the Mathematics In a word the present uncouth way of dividing the months into Saints Days Sundays and the like is no more adapted to the present modes of polite life than the  Roman  division into  Ides Nones  and  Calends  INSTEAD of supposing with the vulgar tribe of astro∣nomers that the day begins at sunrise my day which will commence at the time that it usually breaks in fashion∣able  apartments will be determined by the Rising of people of quality Thus the morning dawns with early risers be∣tween eleven and twelve and noon commences at four when at this time of the year the dinner and waxlights come in together For want of a thorough knowledge of the distribution of the day all who have any connection with the polite world might be guilty of many mistakes and when an honest man from  Cornhill  intended a nobleman a visit after dinner he would perhaps find him sipping his morning chocolate The inconveniences of the old style in our manner of reckoning the days were so manifest that it was thought proper to amend them by act of parli∣ament I am resolved in like manner to introduce the new style of dividing the hours also into my Almanack for can any thing be more absurd than to fix the name of morning noon and evening c at present on the same hours which bore them in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  A Dutchess is so far from dining at eleven that it often happens that Her Grace has not then opened her eyes on the teatable and a Maid of Honour would no more rise at five or six in the morning as it was called by the early dames of Queen  Bess  's court than she would in imitation of those dames breakfast upon strong beer and beefsteaks Indeed in those houses where the hours of quality are observed by only one part of the family the impolite irre∣gularity of the other in adhering to the old style occa∣sions great disturbance for as Lady  Townly  says  "such a house is worse than an inn with ten stage coaches What between the impertinent people of business in a morning and the intolerable thick shoes of footmen at noon one has not a wink of sleep all night"  THE reformation which I have also made in respect to the Redletterdays is no less considerable I have not only wiped away that immense catalogue of Saints which croud the  Popish  Calendar but have also blotted out all the other Saints that still retain their places in our common Alma∣macks wellknowing that persons of fashion pay as little attention to the Apostles and Evangelists as to St  Mildred  St  Bridget  or St  Winifred  Indeed I retain the old name of St  John  because I am sure that people of quality will not think of any body's being designed under that title except the late Lord  Bolingbroke  Having thus discarded the Saints  people whom nobody knows  I have taken care to introduce my readers into the best company for the RedLetters in my Calendar will serve to distinguish those days on which the ladies of the first fashion keep their routes and visiting days a work of infinite use as well to the persons of distinction themselves as to all those who have any occa∣sional intercourse with the polite world That season of the year commonly distinguished by the appellation of  Lent  which implies a time of fasting I shall consider according to its real signification in the  Beau Monde  as a yearly  festi∣val  and shall therefore mention it under the denomination of  The Carnival  The propriety of this will be evident at first sight since nothing is so plain as that at this season all kinds of diversion and jollity are at the height in this metro∣polis Instead of the  Man in the Almanack  I at first in∣tended in imitation of Mr  Dodsley  's Memorandum Book to delineate the figure of a fine gentleman drest  à la mode  but I was at length determined by the advice of some inge∣nious friends to suffer the old picture to remain there since as it appears to be run through the body in several places it may not improperly represent that fashionable character a Duellist  IN the place which is allotted in other Almanacks for the change of weather as hail frost snow cloudy and  the like I shall set down the change of dress adapted to different seasons and ranged under the titles of hats capu∣chins cardinals sacks negligees gause handkerchiefs ermine tippets muffs c and in a parallel column according to the custom of other Almanacks I shall point out the several parts of the body affected by these changes such as head neck breast shoulders face hands feet legs c And as Mr  Rider  accompanies every month with seasonable cau∣tions about sowing turnips raising cabbages bloodletting and such other important articles I shall give such direc∣tions as are most suitable to the beaumonde as a specimen of which I shall beg leave to lay before you the following Observations on the month of May  IF the season proves favourable it will be proper at the beginning of this month to attend to the cultivation of your public gardens Trim your trees put your walks in order look after your lamps have ballads written and set to music for the ensuing summer Ladies and gentlemen must be careful not to catch cold in crossing the water or by expo∣sing themselves to the damp air in the dark walk at  Vauxhall  Towards the middle of this month the air at both play∣houses will begin to be too close and sultry for ladies that paint to risk the loss of their complexion in them  About the end of this month it will be expedient for those ladies who are apt to be hysterical when the town empties to prepare for their removal to  Tunbridge Cheltenham  and  Scarborough  for the benefit of the waters  I am Sir your humble Servant TYCHO COURTLY  {inverted ⁂}I did not think of ever mentioning the old woman who calls herself MARY SINGLETON again but having just received the following letter by the pennypost I cannot so far affront the young lady by whom it is written as not to publish it But though I shall always be glad to hear from one who writes with so much spirit yet I must beg that for the future she would chuse some other subject since to use the expression of that wellbred lady her aunt  "it is not perfectly civil to entertain the town with her private affairs"  SIR  AS my Aunt  Singleton  has publickly given her honour that she will never read any of your future papers I think I may venture to send you a letter without fear of her discovery an incident which might per∣haps be of cruel consequence to me as I know she can never forgive I am not under any apprehensions of being betrayed by her friends She has but few and those are a sort that rather chuse to sooth her weaknesses than to raise her choler not knowing whether in her hours of peevishness some of her bile may not fall upon themselves  I OWN I was much surprised to find my name in print and to see my picture drawn at full length I observe that my guardian Aunt like all painters whether male or female has dipped her pencil in the colours of flattery and accordingly she has drawn me if not entirely perfect at least only with such faults as are rather commendable than otherwise  "A si∣lence in company and too much submission to judgments not so good as my own"  are failings natural to my youth and want of experience which time and an introduction into proper company very different from such as I see at my Aunt's teatable will soon cure but I am still con∣scious that neither the progress of time the gifts of fortune nor the success of improvement can render me what she has already painted me  A faultless monster whom the world ne'er saw  SHE affirms  "that I sing and play to great perfection"  Upon my word Sir I have no voice She teizes me sometimes to squall forth a Solo and I obey because as she justly tells you  "I tremble at her look"  which if it had the family power of one of her antient ancestors must long since have turned me into stone But what is the effect of my song Alas it generally proves only an incantation to rouse the lapdog out of a sound sleep upon his cushion or to set the parrot and the mackaw into a chorus of screaming that would if possible awaken our neighbours the dead in  St Giles's Church Yard  SHE hints that  "I am in love with a certain military Gentleman of no fortune"  and she adds that  "he is modest brave studious and polite"  That an officer comes often to our house is strictly true That he has no fortune is no less so But that I am in love with him is absolutely false nor are his visits to me They are to my Aunt whom he certainly  "would prefer to any dowager whatever without a jointure"  and who to my knowledge would be highly pleased notwithstanding her family pride to change the name of  Singleton  into  OKelly  THIS leads me to let you into the real cause why she prefers  The  WORLD to all other weekly essays whatever The partiality does not arise from the merit of the performance in general but from the subject of one parti∣cular paper N  o  which constantly lies upon her table hid under the workbasket and which strongly recommends by various precepts and ex∣amples the admiration and love of OLD WOMEN  I am watched too close to write to you a longer letter and am therefore obliged to conclude abruptly but am

ludificarier  Pergo ad alios venio ad alios deinde ad alios una res  PLAUT  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  AM one of those idle people of whom you have lately given an account who not being bred to any business or able to get a livelihood by work have taken up the more servile trade of an  Hangeron  I FIRST served my time with an old nobleman in the country and as I was a distant relation of his lordship's I was  admitted to the honour of attending him in the double ca∣pacity of valet and apothecary My business in a morn∣ing was to wait on him at dressing time to hold the bason while he washed his hands buckle his shoes and tye on his neckcloth Besides this his lordship had such a regard for me that nobody but myself was ever trusted with cut∣ting his corns or paring his toenails and whenever he was sick it was always my office to hold his head during the operation of an emetic to attend him in the watercloset when he took a cathartic and sometimes to administer a clyster If his lordship had no company I was indeed permitted to sit at table with him but when he received any visiters more grand than ordinary I was equipped toge∣ther with some of the bestlooking tenants in a tyewig fulltrimmed coat and lacedwaistcoat in order to swell the retinue of his servants out of livery I bore my slavery with the greatest degree of patience as my lord would often hint to me that I was provided for in his will However I had the mortification to find myself supplanted in his good graces by the Chaplain who had always looked upon me as his rival and contrived at length to outwheedle outfawn and outcringe me In a word my lord diedand while the Chaplain who constantly prayed by him du∣ring his last illness had the consolation of having a good benefice secured to him in the will my name was huddled among those of the common servants with no higher le∣gacy than twenty guineas to buy mourning  WITH this small pittance besides what I had made a shift to squeeze out of the tenants and tradesmen as fees for my good word when I had his lordship's ear I came up to town and embarked all I was worth in fitting my∣self  out as a gentleman Soon after as good luck would have it the nephew and heir of my old lord came from abroad when I contrived to wind me into his favour by abusing his deceased uncle and fattened my∣self upon him It is true he supported me admitted me into an equal share of his purse but considering the dan∣gers to which I was constantly exposed on his account I regarded his bounties as only plaisters to my sores My head back and ribs have received many a payment which should have been placed to his lordship's account and I once narrowly escaped being hanged for murdering a poor fellow whom my lord in a frolick had run through the body My patron among other marks of his taste kept a mis∣tress and I as his particular crony and a man of honour was allowed to visit her It happened one evening he un∣luckily surprised us in some unguarded familiarities together But my lord was so far from being enraged at it that he only turned madam out of the room and very coolly kicked me down stairs after her  I WAS now thrown upon the wide world again but as I never wanted assurance I soon made myself very familiarly acquainted with a young gentleman from  Ireland  who was just come over to  England  to spend his estate here I must own I had some difficulty in keeping on good terms with this new friend as I had so many of his own countrymen to contend with who all claimed a right of acquaintance with him and some of them even pretended to be related to him Besides they all persuaded the young squire that they had fortunes in different parts of  Ireland  though not one of them had any real estate any more than myself though indeed I also had a nominal  l per Ann  in  the  WestIndies  These furious fellows for Sir they would all fight gave me much trouble however I found out my young friend's foible and in spite of his countrymen became his inseparable companion He was not only very fond of women but had a particular passion for new faces and to humour this inclination I was perpetually on the lookout to discover fresh pieces for him I brought him mantuamakers milliners and servantmaids in abundance and at length grew so great a favourite by having prevailed on one of my own cousins to comply with his proposals that I verily believe he would soon have made me easy for life in an handsome annuity if he had not been unfortunately run through the body in a duel by one of his own countrymen  I NEXT got into favour with an old colonel of the guards who happened to take a fancy to me one evening at the  Tilt Yard  coffeehouse for having carried off a pint bumper more than a lieutenant of a man of war that had challenged my toast As his sole delight was centered in the bottle all he required of me was to drink glass for glass with him which I readily complied with as he always paid my reckon∣ing When sober he was the besthumoured man in the world but he was very apt to be quarrelsome and extremely mischievous when in liquor He has more than once flung a bottle at my head and emptied the contents of a bowl of punch in my face sometimes he has diverted himself by setting fire to my ruffles shaking the ashes of his pipe over my perriwig or making a thrust at me with the redhot poker and I remember he once soused me all over with the urine of the whole company by clapping a large pewter Jordan topsyturvy upon my head All these indignities  I very patiently put up with as he was sure to make me double amends for them the next morning and I was very near procuring a commission in the army through his interest when to my great disappointment he was suddenly carried off by an apoplexy  YOU will be surprised when I tell you that I next con∣trived to squeeze myself into the good opinion of a rich old curmudgeon a citymerchant and one of the circumcised He could have no objection to my religion as I used to spend every Sunday with him at his countryhouse where I pre∣ferred playing at cards to going to church Nor could I indeed get any thing out of him beyond a dinner but I had higher points in view As he had nobody to inherit his fortune but an only daughter who was kept always in the country I became so desperately in love with her that I would even have turned  Jew  to obtain her Instead of that I very foolishly made a  Christian  of her and we were privately married at the  Fleet  When I came to break the matter to the father and to make an apology for having converted her he received me with a loud laugh  "Sir says he if my child had married the DEVIL he should have had every penny that was her due Butas she is only my Bastard the law cannot oblige me to give her a farthing"  THIS I found to be too true and very happily for me my  Christian  wife had so little regard for her new religion that she again became an apostate and was taken into keep∣ing to which I readily gave my consent by one of her own tribe and complexion I shall not tire you with a particular detail of what has happened to me since I shall only ac∣quaint  you that I have exactly followed the precept of  "becoming all things to all men"  I was once supported very splendidly by a young rake of quality for my wit in talking blasphemy and ridiculing the bible till my patron shot himself through the head and I lived at bed and board with an old Methodist lady for near a twelvemonth on ac∣count of my zeal for the New Doctrine till one of the maidservants wickedly laid a child to me At present Mr TOWN I am quite out of employ having just lost a very profitable place which I held under a great man in quality of his Pimp My disgrace was owing to the baseness of an old  CoventGarden  acquaintance whom I palmed upon his honour for an innocent creature just come out of the coun∣try but the hussy was so ungrateful as to bestow on both of us convincing marks of her thorough knowledge of the town  I am

those who buy Quantities to give away  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CI THURSDAY  January    Janique bifrontis imago  Virg  A  S the appointed time of our publication now happens to fall on Newyear'sday I cannot open the business of the year with a better grace than by taking the present hour for the subject of this paper a subject which pleases me the more as it also gives me an opportunity of paying my readers the compliments of the season and most sincerely wishing them all  a happy new year and a great many of them  But in order to make these civilities of more consequence than a bare compliment I will also endeavour to give them a little  wholesome advice by which they may be most likely to ensure to themselves that happiness and to go through the ensuing year with ease and tranquility  No God in the heathen  Pantheon  was expressed by properer emblems or more significantly represented than  Janus  whom we may fairly stile in our language the God of the New Year The medals on which the image of this Deity was engraved bore two faces not ogling each other like those on the shillings of  Philip  and  Mary  nor cheek by jowl like the double visage on the coin of  William  and  Mary  but turned from each other one looking forwards as it were into futurity and the other taking a retrospective view of what was past There can∣not surely be devised a stronger or more sensible lesson of moral instruction than this figure teaches us This double view comprehends in itself the sum of human prudence for the most perfect reason can go no higher than wisely to guess at the future by reflecting on the past and morality is never so likely to persevere in a steady and uniform course as when it sets out with a fix'd determination of mutually regulating the New Year by a recollection of the Old and at the same time making the succeeding a critique on the last  Most of the faults in the general conduct of mankind and their frequent miscarriages in their most favourite en∣terprizes will be found upon examination to result from an imperfect and partial view of what relates to their duty or undertakings Some regulate their actions by blind guess and rashly presuming on the future without the least attention to the past With these the impe∣tuosity of the passions gives their reason no scope to exert itself but neglecting the premises they jump to a con∣clusion Others who are often taken for men of deep  reflection and marvellous understanding meditate so profoundly on the past that they scarce take any notice either of the present or the future To these two cha∣racters whose misconduct arises from two such contrary sources may indeed be added a third whose wild irre∣gular behaviour is founded on no fix'd principles but proceeds from a total absence of thought and reflection These easy creatures act entirely at random neither troubling themselves with what has been what is or what will be and as the image of  Janus  seems to bear two heads these thoughtless vacant animals may almost be said to have no head at all  But that the necessity of taking this comprehensive view of our affairs may appear in the stronger light let us consider the many difficulties in which men of any of the above characters are involved from a total neglect or partial survey of matters that should influence their conduct The first sort of men who nourish great expectations from the future and suffer hope to lay their prudence to sleep are very common Indeed almost every man like the dairymaid with her pail of milk pleases himself with calculating the advantages he shall reap from his undertakings There is scarce a servitor at either university who when he takes orders does not think it more than possible he may one day be a bishop or at least head of a college though perhaps at first he is glad to snap at a curacy Every walking attendant on our hospitals flatters himself that a few years will settle him in high practice and a chariot and among those few gentlemen of the inns of court who really deserve the name of students there is hardly one who sits down to Lord  Coke  without imagining that he may himself some time or other be Lord Chancellor At this early period  of life these vain hopes may perhaps serve as spurs to dili∣gence and virtue but what shall we say to those people who in spite of experience and repeated disappointments still place their chief dependance on groundless expecta∣tions from their future fortune This Town swarms with people who rely almost solely on contingencies and our goals are often filled with wretches who brought on their own poverty and misfortunes by promising themselves great profit from some darling scheme which has at last been attended with bankruptcy The present extra∣vagance of many of our spendthrifts is built on some ideal riches of which they are soon to be in pos∣session and which they are laying out as freely as the girl in the farce squanders the ten thousand pounds she was to get in the lottery I am myself acquainted with a young fellow who had great expectations from an old uncle He had ten thousand pounds of his own in ready money and as the old gentleman was a good deal turned of sixty the nephew very considerately computed that his uncle could hardly last above five years during which time he might go on very genteely at the rate of  l per ann  However the old gentleman held toge∣ther above seven years the two last of which our young spark had no consolation but the daily hopes of his uncle's death The happy hour at length arrived the will was tore open with rapture when alas the fond youth discovered that he had never once reflected that though he had a ticket in the wheel it might possibly come up a blank and had the mortification to find himself disin∣herited  I shall not dwell so particularly on the ridiculous folly of those profound speculatists who fix their attention en∣tirely on what is past without making their reflections of service either for the present or the future because it is not a very common or tempting species of absurdity  but shall rather advise the reader to consider the time past as the school of experience from which he may draw the most useful lessons for his future conduct This kind of retrospect would teach us to provide with fore∣sight against the calamities to which our inexperience has hitherto exposed us though at the same time it would not throw us so far back as to keep us lagging like the Old Stile behind the rest of the world To say the truth those sage persons who are given to such deep re∣flection as to let today and tomorrow pass unregarded by meditating on yesterday are as ridiculous in their con∣duct as country beaux in their dress who adopt the town modes just after they are become unfashionable in  London  But there is no task so difficult as to infuse ideas into a brain hitherto entirely unaccustomed to thinking for how can we warn a man to avoid the misfortunes which may hereafter befal him or to improve by the calamities he has already suffered whose actions are not the result of thought or guided by experience These persons are indeed of all others the most to be pitied They are prodigal and abandoned in their conduct and by vi∣cious excesses ruin their constitution till at length poverty and death stare them in the face together or if unfortu∣nately their crazy frame holds together after the utter destruction of their fortune they finish a thoughtless life by an act of desperation and a pistol puts an end to their miseries  Since then good fortune cannot be expected to fall into our laps and it requires some thought to ensure to our∣selves a likelihood of success in our undertakings let us look back with attention on the old year and gather instruc∣tions from it in what manner to conduct ourselves through  the New Let us also endeavour to draw from it a lesson of morality and I hope it will not be thought too solemn a conclusion of this paper if I advise my readers to carry this reflection even into religion This train of thought that teaches us at once to reflect on the past and look forward to the future will also naturally lead us to look up with awe and admiration towards that Being who has existed from all eternity and shall exist world with∣out end No idea can give us a more exalted idea of the Power who first created us and whose providence is always over us Let us then consider with attention this pagan image by which we may add force to our morality and prudence to our ordinary conduct nor let us blush to receive a lesson from Heathens which may animate our zeal and reverence for the Author of Christianity  G K is desired to send to the Publisher's where a Letter is left for him  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CII THURSDAY  January    Longumque pulchrâ stemma repetit a Ledâ  MART  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  T has been my good fortune to be born of a family that is recorded in the Herald's Dictionary as one of the most antient in the kingdom We are supposed to have come into  England  with  William  the Con∣queror Upon my accession some years ago to my elder brother's estate and title of a Baronet I received a visit from  Rouge Dragon  Esq  Pursuivant at Arms to congratulate me upon my new rank of a  Vavasour  and to know whether I should chuse to bear the  dexter base points of the Lady Isa∣bel's Saltire in chief  or only her  Sinister corners  she being one of the seventeen coheiresses of my great great great  great great grandfather's fourth wife  Dorothy  the daughter and sole heiress of  Simon de la Frogpool  of  Croakham  in  Suf∣folk  This unexpected visit must have disconcerted me to an invincible degree if upon recollection I had not only re∣membered Mr  Rouge Dragon  as a constant companion to my late brother but as a kind of tutor in initiating him into the Science of Heraldy and the Civil and Military Atchievements to which our nobility and gentry are entitled As soon therefore as I could recover myself from my first surprise in hearing an unknown  English  language I hum∣bly thanked Mr  Dragon  for the pains he had taken in con∣sidering my Coat of Arms so minutely but hoped he would give himself no farther trouble upon my account because I was fully determined to  bear  the plain  Shield  of my grand∣father Sir  Peter  without taking the least notice of Lady  Isabel's Saltire in chief  or even of her  Sinister corners  BE it to my shame or not I must confess that Heraldry is a science which I have never much cultivated nor do I find it very prevalent among the fashionable studies of the age Arms and Armorial tokens may I suppose be regu∣larly distinguished and properly emblazoned upon the family plate to which they belong but I have observed of late that these honorable ensigns are not confined entirely to their proper owners but are usurped by every body who thinks fit to take them insomuch that there is scarce an hackney coach in  London  which is not in possession of a Ducal Crest an Earl's Coronet or a Baronet's Bloody Hand This has often given me great offence as it reflects a scandal on our nobility and gentry and I cannot but think it very indecent for a Duke's coach to be seen waiting at a nightcellar while the coach∣man  is tipping off a glass of gin or for a Countess's landau to set down ladies at the door of a common bawdyhouse I remember I was one morning disturbed at my breakfast by a fashionable rap at my door when looking out of my window I saw the coach of the lady dowager drawn up before it I was extremely surprised at so early and un∣expected a visit from her ladyship and while I was pre∣paring to receive her I overheard her ladyship at high words with her coachman in my entry when stepping to the staircase I found that they were squabbling together about sixpence and soon perceived that her ladyship was dwindled into one of my housemaids This badge of nobility assu∣med at random according to the fancy of the coachpainter I have found inconvenient on other occasions for I once travelled from  London  to  Derby  in an hired chariot finely or∣namented with a Viscount's cypher and coronet by which noble circumstance I was compelled in every inn to pay as a Lord though I was not at that time even a simple Baronet or in the language of my friend Mr  Dragon  arrived to the dignity of a  Vavasour  I HAVE indeed sometimes doubted whether nobility and high rank are of that real advantage which they are generally esteemed to be and I am almost inclined to think that they answer no other desirable end than as far as they indulge our vanity and ostentation A long roll of ennobled ancestors makes I confess a very alluring appearance To see coronet after coronet passing before our view in an uninterrupted succession is the most soothing prospect that perhaps can present itself to the eye of human pride The exaltation that we feel upon such a review takes rise in a visionary and secret piece of flattery that as glorious and as  long or even a longer line of future coronets may spring from ourselves as have depended from our ancestors We read in  Virgil  that  Anchises  to inspire his son with the properest incitement to virtue shews him a long race of kings emperors and heroes whom  Aeneas  is foredoomed to give rise to and the misery of  Macbeth  is made by  Shakespeare  to proceed less from the consciousness of guilt than from the disappointed pride that none of his own race shall succeed him in the throne  THE pride of ancestry and the desire of continuing our lineage when they tend to an incitement of virtuous and noble actions are undoubtedly laudable and I should per∣haps have indulged myself in the pleasing reflection had not a particular story in a  French  Novel which I lately met with put a stop to all vain glories that can possibly be deduced from a long race of progenitors  "A NOBLEMAN of an antient house of very high rank and great fortune"  says the Novellist  "died suddenly and without being permitted to stop at Purgatory was sent down immediately into Hell He had not been long there before he met with his coachman  Thomas  who like his noble master was gnashing his teeth among the damned  Thomas  surprised to behold his lordship amidst the sharpers thieves pickpockets and all the  Canaille  of Hell started and cried out in a tone of admiration Is it possible that I see my late master among  Lucifer  's tribe of beggars rogues and pilferers How much am I astonished to find your lordship in this place Your lordship whose generosity was so great whose affluent housekeeping drew such crowds of nobility gentry and  friends to your table and within your gates and whose fine taste employed such numbers of poor in your gardens by building temples and obelisks and by forming lakes of water that seemed to vye with the largest oceans of the creation Pray my lord if I may be so bold what crime has brought your lordship into this cursed assemblyAh  Thomas  replied his lordship with his usual con∣descension I have been sent hither for having defrauded my royal master and cheating the widows and fatherless solely to enrich and purchase titles honours and estates for that ungrateful rascal my only son But prithee  Tho∣mas  tell me as thou didst always seem to be an honest careful sober servant what brought thee hither Alas my noble lord replied  Thomas  I was sent hither for be∣getting that Son"  I am Sir your most humble Servant REGINALD FITZWORM  I MUST agree with my correspondent that the study of Heraldry is at present in very little repute among us and our nobility are more anxious about preserving the genealogy of their horses than of their own family Whatever value their progenitors may have formerly set upon their Blood it is now found to be of no value when put into the scale and weighed against solid  plebeian  gold Nor would the most illustrious descendant from  Cadwallader  or the  Irish  Kings scruple to debase his lineage by an alliance with the daughter of a cityplumb though all her ancestors were yeomen and none of her family ever  bore arms  Titles of quality when the owners have no other merit to recommend them are of no more estimation than those which the courtesy of the vulgar have bestowed on the deformed and when I look over a long Tree of Descent I sometimes fancy I can discover the real characters of  Sharpers Repro∣bates  and  Plunderers of their Country  concealed under the titles of  Dukes Earls  and  Viscounts  IT is well known that the very servants in the absence of their master assume the same titles and  Tom  or  Harry  the butler or groom of his Grace is always  my Lord Duke  in the kitchen or stables For this reason I have thought proper to present my reader with the Pedigree of a Footman drawn up in the same sounding titles as are so pompously displayed on these occasions and I dare say it will appear no less illustrious than the pedigrees of many families which are neither celebrated for their actions nor distinguished by their virtues  THE Family of the SKIPS or SKIPKENNELS is very antient and noble The founder of it  Maitre Jaques  came into  England  with the Dutchess of Mazarine He was son of a Prince of the Blood his mother one of the  Mesdames  of  France  This family is therefore related to the most illus∣trious  Maitres d' Hotèl  and  Valets de Chambre  of that kindgom  Jaques  had issue two Sons  viz Robert  and  Paul  of whom  Paul  the youngest was invested with the purple before he was eighteen and made a Bishop and soon after became an Archbishop  Robert  the elder came to be a Duke but died without issue  Paul  the Archbishop left behind him an only daughter  Barbara  baseborn who was afterwards Maid of Honour and intermarrying with a Lord of the Bedchamber had a very numerous issue by him  viz Re∣becca  born a week after their marriage and died young  Joseph  first a Squire afterwards Knighted High Sheriff of a County and Colonel of the Militia  Peter  raised from a CabinBoy to a Lord of the Admiralty  William  a Faggot in the First Regiment of the Guards and a Brigadier  Tho∣mas  at first an Earl's Eldest Son and afterwards Lord Mayor of the City of  London  The several branches of this family were no less distinguished for their illustrious progeny  Jaques  the founder first quartered lace on his coat and  Robert  added the shoulderknot Some of them indeed met with great trouble Archbishop  Paul  lost his See for getting a cookmaid with child  Barbara  the Maid of Honour was dismissed with a big belly Brigadier  William  was killed by a Chairman in a pitched battle at an alehouse the Lord of the Admi∣ralty was transported for seven years and Duke  Robert  had the misfortune to be hanged at  Tyburn  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CIII THURSDAY  January    Nihil videtur mundius  TER  To Mr TOWN  SIR  I  T is my fortune to be married to a lady who is an extraordinary good housewife and is cried up by all the good women of her acquaintance for being the  neatest body in her house  they ever knew This Sir is my grievance This superabundant Neatness is so very troublesome and disgusting to me that I protest I had rather lodge in a carrier's inn or take up my abode with the horses in the stables  IT must be confessed that a due regard to Neatness and Cleanliness is as necessary to be observed in our habitations  as our persons But though I should not chuse to have my hands begrimed like a chimneysweeper's I would not as among the superstitious  Mahometans  wash them six times a day And though I should be loth to roll in a pigstye yet I do not like to have my house rendered useless to me under the pretence of keeping it clean  FOR my own part I cannot see the difference between having an house that is always dirty and an house that is always to be cleaned I could very willingly compound to be washed out of my home with other masters of families every Saturday night But my wife is so very notable that the same cleansing work must be repeated every day in the week All the morning long I am sure to be entertained with the domestic concert of scrubbing the floors scouring the irons and beating the carpets and I am constantly hunted from room to room while one is to be dusted ano∣ther dryrubbed another washed and another run over with a dry mop Thus indeed I may be said to live in continual dirtiness that my house may be clean For during these nice operations every apartment is stowed with soap brickdust sand scrubbingbrushes hairbrooms ragmops and dishclouts  YOU may suppose that the greatest care is taken to pre∣vent the least speck of dirt from soiling the floors For this reason all that come to our house besides the ceremony of scraping at the door are obliged to rub their shoes for half an hour on a large ragged mat at the entrance and then they must straddle their way along several lesser mats ranged at due distances from each other in the passage and like boys at play come into the room with a hop a step and a  jump The like caution is used by all the family I my∣self am scarce allowed to stir a step without slippers my wife creeps on tiptoe up and down stairs the maidservants are continually stumping below in clogs or pattens and the footman is obliged to sneak about the house barefooted as if he came with a sly design to steal something  AFTER what has been said you will naturally conclude that my wife must be no less nice in other particulars In∣deed she cannot conceive that any thing which is done by so neat a woman can possibly give offence I have there∣fore been in pain for her several times when I have seen her before company dust the teacups with a foul apron or a washinggown and I have more than once blushed for her when through her extreme cleanliness she has not been con∣tented without breathing into our drinkingglasses and after∣wards wiping them with her pocket handkerchief People Mr TOWN who are very intimate with families seldom see them especially the female part but in disguise and it will be readily allowed that a lady wears a very different aspect when she comes before company than when she first sets down to her toilette My wife appears decent enough in her apparel to those who visit us in the after∣noon but in the morning she is quite another figure Her usual dishabille then is an ordinary stuff jacket and petticoat a double clout thrown over her head and pinned under her chin a black greasy bonnet and a coarse dowlas apron so that you would rather take her for a chairwoman Nor indeed does she scruple to stoop to the meanest drudgery of one for such is her love of Cleanliness that I have often seen her on her knees whitening an hearth or spreading dabs of vinegar and fullers earth over the boards  IT is observed by  Swift  that  "a nice man is a man of nasty ideas"  In like manner we may affirm that your very neat people are the most slovenly on many occasions I have told you my wife's morning trim but besides this she has another custom which creates the greatest disgust in me You must know Sir that among other charms she prides herself vastly in a fine set of teeth and somebody has told her that nothing is so good for them as to rub them every morning with  Scotch  snuff and fasting spittle As an hus∣band is no stranger this recipe is constantly administered in my presence before breakfast and after this delicate appli∣cation her pretty mouth which is afterwards wiped for  me  to kiss in order to preserve her gums from the scurvy must be rincedwould you believe itwith her own water  I SHALL dwell no longer on this subject as I fear it may prove surfeiting both to you and your readers I shall there∣fore conclude with telling you that this scrupulous delicacy of my wife in the Neatness of her house was the means of our losing a very good fortune A rich old uncle on whom we had great dependance came up to town last summer on purpose to pay us a visit but though he had rode above sixty miles that day he was obliged to stand in the passage till his boots were pulled off for fear of soiling the  Turkey  carpet After supper the old gentleman as was his constant practice desired to have his pipe but this you may be sure could by no means be allowed as the filthy stench of the to∣bacco would never be got out of the furniture again and it was with much ado that my wife would even suffer him to go down and smoke in the kitchen We had no room  lodge him in except a garret with nothing but bare walls because the Chints bedchamber was indeed too nice for a dirty country squire These slights very much chagrined my good uncle but he had not been with us above a day or two before my wife and he came to an open quarrel and the occasion of it was this It happened that he had brought a favourite pointer with him who at his first co∣ming was immediately locked up in the coalhole but the dog having found means to escape had crept slily up stairs and besides other marks of his want of delicacy had very calmly stretched himself out upon a crimson damask settee My wife not only sentenced him to the discipline of the whip but insisted upon having the criminal hanged up after∣wards when the master interposing in his behalf it pro∣duced such high words between them that my uncle or∣dered his horse and swore he would never  darken our doors  again as long as he breathed He went home and about two months after died but as he could not forgive the ill treatment which both he and his dog had met with at our house he had altered his will which before he had made entirely in our favour  I am Sir Your humble Servant PETER MUCKLOVE  IT may not be improper as my correspondent has but slightly touched upon this topic to add a word or two by way of postcript to his letter on the extraordinary sollici∣tude of many notable housewives in the care and preserva∣tion of their furniture In middling genteel families it is not uncommon to have things more for shew than use  and I cannot but applaud the ingenious thought of a friend of mine who has contrived to furnish his house in the most elegant taste at a very small expence He is pleased it is true to eat off your common stone ware because it looks so clean but you see his beaufet crowded with a variety of curious enamelled China plates which are ranged in such manner as to conceal the streaks of white paint that cement the broken pieces together he likes to drink his porter out of the original alehouse pewter pot but a large silver tan∣kard always stands upon the sideboard which the most curious eye cannot at that distance discover to be  French  plate The whole range of rooms in his middle story is most grandly fitted up but as it would be pity to soil such good furniture his curtains which we must suppose to be made of the richest damask are carefully pinned up in paperbags and the chairs of which the seats and backs are undoubtedly of the same stuff are no less cautiously skreened with ordinarychecked linnen Thus does he an∣swer by the appearance of finery all the purposes of pride and ostentationLike many families who being really possessed of ornamental and useful furniture make no more use of it than the beau blockhead does of his library which though it contains many books finely bound and gilt is designed merely for shew and it would spoil the backs or rumple the leaves to look into the contents of them  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CIV THURSDAY  January    Actum est Ilicet Perîsti  TER  T  HE use of language is the ready communi∣cation of our thoughts to one another As we cannot produce the objects which raise ideas in our minds we use words which are made signs of those objects themselves No man could convey to another the idea of a table or chair without pointing to those pieces of furniture as children are taught to remember the names of things by looking at their pictures Thus if I wanted to mention King  Charles  on horseback I must carry my companion to  CharingCross  and would I next tell him of the statue of Sir  John Barnard  we must trudge back again and he must wait for my mean∣ing 'till we got to the  Royal Exchange  We should be like the sages of  Laputa  who as  Gulliver  tells us having substituted  things  for  words  used to carry about them  such  things  as were necessary to express the particular business they were to discourse on  "I have often beheld says he two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when they met in the streets would lay down their loads open their sacks and hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements help each other to resume their burthens and take their leave"  In these circumstances a man of the fewest words could not indeed talk without carrying about him a much larger apparatus of conversation than is contained in the bag of the noted  Yeates  or any other slightofhand artist he could not speak of a chicken or an owl but it must be ready in his pocket to be produ∣ced In such a case we could not say we heard but we saw the conversation of a friend as in the epistolary correspond∣ence carried on by those pretty  hieroglyphic  letters as they are called where the picture of a  deer  and a  woman finely drest  is made to stand for the expression of  dear lady  BUT the invention of words has removed these difficulties and we may talk not only of any thing we have seen but what neither we nor the persons to whom we speak ever saw Thus we can convey to another the idea of a battle without being reduced to the disagreeable necessity of learn∣ing it  "from the cannon's mouth"  and we can talk of the people in the world of the moon without being obliged to make use of Bishop  Wilkins  's artificial wings to fly thither Words therefore in the ordinary course of life are like the papermoney among merchants invented as a more ready conveyance by which the largest sum can be trans∣mitted to the most distant places with as much ease as a let∣ter while the same in specie would require bags and chests and even carts or ships to transport it But however great these advantages are the use of language has brought along with it several inconveniences as well as papermoney for as this latter is more liable to miscarry more easily concealed  carried off or counterfeited than bullion merchants have frequent cause to complain that the convenience of this sort of cash is not without some alloy of evil and we find that in the use of language there is so much room for deceit and mistake that though it does not render it useless it is much to be wished some remedy could be contrived  MEN are so apt to use the same words in different senses and to call the same thing by different names that they can∣not oftentimes understand or be understood If one calls that thing black which another calls green or that prodigality which another calls generosity they mistake each other's meaning and can never come to agree 'till they explain the words It is to this we owe so much wrangling in dis∣course and so many volumes of controversy on almost every part of literature I have known a dispute carried on with great warmth and when the disputants have come to explain what each meant it has been discovered they were both of a side like the men in the Play who met and fought first and after each had been heartily beat found themselves to be friends What should we say if this practice of calling things by their wrong names was to obtain among tradesmen If you was to send to your haberdasher for an hat you might receive a pair of stockings or instead of a cordial julep from your apothecary be furnished with a cathartic or a clyster  IT would be needless to insist on the inconveniences ari∣sing from the misuse or misapprehension of terms in all ver∣bal combats whether they be fought on the spot by word of mouth or like a game of Chess maintained even tho' lands and seas interpose by the assistance of the press In our ordinary conversation it is notorious that no less confu∣sion has arisen from the wrong application or perversion of the original and most natural import of words Thus for instance the word  Devil  is used at present only as a bug∣bear for children nor will it raise in the most vulgar minds  the idea even of a cloven foot or the smell of brimstone and all we can understand by it are the errandboy of a printinghouse the name of a tavern and the broiled giz∣zard of a turkey The no less tremendous words  damned  and  hellish  are usurped equally to signify any thing superla∣tively good as well as bad and I am almost ashamed to mention that we cannot wonder a particular liquor should be distinguished by the name of  bishop  when the title of the highest dignitary of our church has been prostituted to a more scandalous purpose A mere country put might be startled at this juncture especially at the warlike sound of a  route  a  drum  or a  drummajor  which we know have been long adopted by the fashionable world without any de∣sign to alarm us with the notion of a campaign or a battle but only to call us without a pun to more peaceful engage∣ments and he would be very much surprised to receive a card from a lady of quality inviting him to an  Hurricane  or perhaps an EARTHQUAKE  I REMEMBER when I commenced author I published a little pamphlet which I flattered myself had some merit though I must confess it did not sell Conscious of my grow∣ing fame I resolved to send the first fruits of it to an aunt in the country that my relations might judge of the great ho∣nour I was likely to prove to the family but how was I mortified when the good lady sent me word  "that she was sorry to find I had  ruined  myself and had wrote a book for the parson of the parish had assured her that authors were never worth a farthing and always died in a goal"  Notwithstanding this remonstrance I have still persisted in my  ruin  which at present I cannot say is quite compleated as I can make three meals a day have yet a coat to my back with a clean shirt for Sundays at least and am lodged somewhat below a garret However this pre∣diction of my aunt has often led me to consider in how many senses different from its general acceptation the word  RUINED is frequently made use of When we hear this ap∣plied to another we should naturally imagine the person is reduced to a state worse than he was in before and so low that it is scarce possible for him to rise again but we shall often find instead of his being undone that he has rather met with some extraordinary good fortune and that those who pronounce him  ruined  either mean you should understand it in some other light or else call him undone because he differs from them in his way of life or because they wish him to be in that situation I need not point out the extreme cruelty as well as injustice in the misapplica∣tion of this term as it may litterally  ruin  a man by de∣stroying his character according to the old  English  proverb  give a dog an ill name and hang him  MOST people are indeed so entirely taken up with their own narrow views that like the jaundiced eye every thing appears to them of the same colour and it is no wonder that they should see ruin staring every man in the face who happens not to think as they do From this selfish preju∣dice we are led to make a wrong judgment of the motives and actions of others I shall therefore here set down a catalogue of some of my own acquaintance whom the cha∣rity and goodnature of the world have not scrupled to pro∣nounce absolutely  ruined  A young clergyman of  Cambridge  might have had a good college living in about thirty years time or have been head of the house but he chose to quit his fellowship for a small cure in town with a view of recommending himself by his preaching  Ruined  A fellow of another college refused to quit his books and his retirement to live as chaplain with a smoking drinking swearing foxhunting country squire who would have pro∣vided for him  Ruined  Dr  Classic  a young physician from  Oxford  might have had more practice than  Radcliffe  or  Mead  but having studied  Aristotle's Poetics  and read the  Greek  Tragedies as well as  Galen  and  Hippocrates  he was tempted to write a play which was universally applauded  Ruined  A Student of the  Temple  might have made sure of a Judge's Robes or the Chancellor's Seals but being tired of saunter∣ing in  Westminster Hall  without even getting half a guinea for a motion he has accepted of a commission in one of the newraised regiments and is  Ruined  A younger brother of a good family threw himself away upon an obscure widow with a jointure of  l per annum  by which he is  Ruined  Another a man of fortune fell in love with and married a genteel girl without a farthing and though she makes him an excellent wife he is universally allowed to have  Ruined himself  BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of the strange sense in which a friend of mine once heard this word used by a girl of the town The young creature being all life and spirits engrossed all the conversation to herself and her∣self indeed was the subject of all the conversation But what most surprised him was the manner in which she used this word  Ruined  which occurred frequently in her discourse though never intended by her to convey the meaning gene∣rally affixed to it It served her sometimes as an aera to determine the date of every occurrenceshe bought such a gown just after she was  ruined  the first time she saw  Garrick  in  Ranger  she was in doubt whether it was before or after she was  ruined  Having occasion to mention a young gen∣tleman she burst into rapturesO he is a dear creatureHe it was that  ruined  meO he is a dear soulHe car∣ried me to an inn ten miles from my father's house in the country where he  ruined  meIf he had not  ruined  me I should have been as miserable and as moping as my sisters But the dear soul was forced to go to sea and I was obliged to come upon the town three weeks after I was  ruined  no not so much as three weeks after I was  ruined  yes it was full three weeks after I was  ruined  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CV THURSDAY  January    Gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi  HOR  M  Y Cousin VILLAGE from whom I had not heard for some time has lately sent me an account of a  Country Parson  which I dare say will prove entertaining to my town readers who can have no other idea of our Clergy than what they have collected from the spruce and genteel figures which they have been used to contemplate here in doctors scarfs puddingsleeves starched bands and feathertopp'd grizzles It will be found from my Cousin's de∣scription that these reverent ensigns of orthodoxy are not so necessary to be displayed among rustics and that when they are out of the pulpit or surplice the good pastors may without censure put on the manners as well as dress of a groom or whipperin  Mr VILLAGE to Mr TOWN  Doncaster  Jan  th  DEAR COUSIN  I AM just arrived here after having paid a visit to our old acquaintance  Jack Quickset  who is now become the Reverend Mr  Quickset  Rector of parish in the NorthRiding of this county a living worth upwards of three hundred pounds  per annum  As the ceremonies of ordination have occasioned no alteration in  Jack  's morals or behaviour the Figure he makes in the church is some∣what remarkable but as there are many other incumbents of country livings whose clerical characters will be found to tally with his perhaps a slight sketch or as I may say  rough draught  of him with some account of my visit will not be unentertaining to your readers  JACK hearing that I was in this part of the world sent me a very hearty letter informing me that he had been  doublejapanned  as he called it about a year ago and was the present incummbent of where if I would favour him with my company he would give me a cup of the best  Yorkshire  Stingo and would engage to shew me a noble day's sport as he was in a fine open country with plenty of foxes I rejoiced to hear he was so comfortably settled and set out immediately for his living When I arrived within the gate my ears were alarmed with such a loud chorus of  No mortals on earth are so happy as we  that I began to think I had made a mistake till observing its close neighbourhood to the church convinced me that this could be no other than the ParsonageHouse On my entrance my friend whom  I found in the midst of a roomfull of foxhunters in boots and bob wigs got up to welcome me to and em∣bracing me gave me the full flavour of his Stingo by belching in my face as he did me the honour of saluting me He then introduced me to his friends and placing me at the right hand of his own elbow chair assured them that I was a very  honest Cock  and loved a chace of five and twenty miles an end as well as any of them to preserve the credit of which character I immediately complied with an injunction though I must confess with less real rapture than a staunch foxhunter to toss off a pint bumper of Port with the foot of the fox dipped and squeezed into it to give a zest to the liquor  BUT the whole oeconomy of  Jack  's life is very different from that of his brethren Instead of having a wife and a housefull of children the most common family of a country clergyman he is single unless we credit some idle whispers in the parish that he is married to his housekeeper The calm amusement of piquet chess and backgammon have no charms for  Jack  who sees  "his dearest action in the field"  and boasts that he has a brace of as good hunters in his stable as ever leg was laid over Hunting and shoot∣ing are the only business of his life foxhounds and pointers lay about in every parlour and he is himself like  Pistol  al∣ways in boots The estimation in which he holds his friends is rated according to their excellence as sportsmen and to be able to make a good shot or hunt a pack of hounds well are admirable qualities His parishioners often earn a shil∣ling and a cup of ale at his house by coming to acquaint him that they have found a hare sitting or a fox in cover One day while I was alone with my friend the servant  came in to tell him that the Clerk wanted to speak with him He was ordered in but I could not help smiling when instead of giving notice of a burying christening or some other church business as I expected I found the ho∣nest clerk only come to acquaint his reverend superior that there was a covey of partridges of a dozen brace at least not above three fields from the house  JACK's elder brother Sir  Thomas Quickset  who presented him with the benefice he now enjoys is lord of the manor so that  Jack  has full power to beat up the game unmolested He goes out three times a week with his brother's hounds whether Sir  Thomas  hunts or not and has besides a deputation from him as lord of the manor consigning the game to his care and empowering him to take away all guns nets and dogs from persons not duly qualified  Jack  is more proud of this office than many other country clergymen are of being in the commission for the peace Poaching is in his eye the most heinous crime in the two tables nor does the cure of souls appear to him half so important a duty as the preservation of the Game  SUNDAY you may suppose is as dull and tedious to this ordained sportsman as to any fine lady in town not that he makes the duties of his function any fatigue to him but as this day is necessarily a day of rest from the usual toils of the chase It happened that the first Sunday after I was with him he had engaged to take care of a Church in the absence of a neighbouring clergyman which was about twenty miles off I engaged to accompany him and the more to encourage me he had assured me that we should ride over as fine a champaign open country as any in the  North  Accordingly I was rouzed by him in the morning before daybreak by a loud hollowing of  hark to Merriman  and the repeated smacks of his halfhunter and after we had fortified our stomachs with several slices of hung beef and a horn or two of stingo we sallied forth  Jack  was mounted upon a hunter which he assured me was never yet  thrown out  and as we rode along he could not help lament∣ing that so fine a  soft  morning should be thrown away upon a Sunday at the same time remarking that the dogs might run breast high  THOUGH we made the best of our way over hedge and ditch and  took  every thing we were often delayed by trying if we could prick a hare or by leaving the road to examine a piece of cover and he frequently made me stop not to look at the prospect but while he pointed out the particular course that  Reynard  took or the spot where he had  earth'd  At length we arrived on full gallop at the Church where we found the congregation waiting for us but as  Jack  had no∣thing to do but to alight pull his band out of the sermon∣case give his brown scratch bob a shake and clap on the surplice he was presently equipped for the service In short he behaved himself both in the desk and pulpit to the entire satisfaction of all the parish as well as the squire of it who after thanking  Jack  for his excellent discourse very cor∣dially took us home to dinner with him  I SHALL not trouble you with an account of our enter∣tainment at the squire's who being himself as keen a sports∣man as ever followed a pack of dogs was hugely delighted with  Jack  's conversation  Church and King  and another particular toast were in compliment I suppose to my friend's  clerical character the first drank after dinner but these were directly followed by a pint bumper to  Horses sound Dogs hearty Earth stopt and Foxes plenty  When we had run over again with great joy and vociferation as many chaces as the time would permit the bell called us to even∣ing prayers after which though the squire would fain have had us stay and take an hunt with him we mounted our horses at the churchdoor and rode home in the dark because  Jack  had engaged to meet several of his brothersportsmen who were to lie all night at his own house to be in readiness to make up for the loss of Sunday by going out a cockshooting very early the next morning  I MUST leave it to you Cousin to make what reflec∣tions you please on this character only observing that the country can furnish many instances of these ordained sports∣men whose thoughts are more taken up with the stable or the dogkennel than the church and indeed it will be found that our friend  Jack  and all of his stamp are regarded by their parishioners not as Parsons of the Parish but rather as Squires in Orders  I am dear Cousin yours  c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CVI THURSDAY  February    Non haec solennia nobis  Vana superstitio veterumve ignara Deorum  Imposuit Saevis hospes Trojane periclis  Servati facimus  VIRG  I  T is with the utmost pleasure that I have observed an article in the newspapers sig∣nifying that the magistrates of this city will oblige all taverns alehouses c to be shut up tomorrow which is appointed to be set apart as a day of solemn fast and humiliation on account of those dreadful Earthquakes from which we have been so providentially preserved Without such a restriction it is to be feared that too many of the vulgar will observe this day in the same manner as they are wont to observe the or∣dinary  Sundays which they have been long accustomed to look upon as dedicated to Idleness and Intemperance to which deities they very devoutly pour their libations accord∣ing to their own phrase in a  church with a chimney in it  BUT if the common herd are to be thus compelled to their duty persons of fashion who are above the law will I doubt pay as little regard to this nominal fastday as to  AshWednesday GoodFriday  or the longexploded th of  January  Nor can we expect that it will work any greater reformation of manners in them than the absurd panic oc∣casioned formerly by the ridiculous predictions of a  Swiss  madman Therefore as they are not to be frightened into a sense of virtue and religion we should rather try to wean them gradually from their darling vices which may be kept under by softening methods though we cannot hope wholly to eradicate them For this purpose the first step to be previously taken as it appears to me should be to decoy people of quality into coming to church by making it as fashionable to be seen there as it was some time ago to meet at  Ranelagh  on a Sunday They must therefore be al∣lowed to curtesy bow nod smile ogle whisper or even bawl to one another before the service is begun and that churches may resemble other public places of diversion ladies and gentlemen may be permitted to send their servants to keep places in the pews but it shall on no consideration be lawful for them as is their custom at the opera or playhouse to disturb the congregation by dropping in while the prayers are reading or to interrupt the parson by talking loud in the middle of the sermon  THIS point being once gained it might be possible to bring about some other reformations in the polite amuse∣ments Perhaps to banish all such moral plays as the  Chances  for ever from our theatres would be in effect to shut them up or condemn them to empty boxes the polite world may therefore be sometimes indulged with them  at the particular desire of several persons of quality  or for the be∣nefit of some hospital when their appearance may be attri∣buted to a motive of charity Nor would I be so scrupu∣lous as to abolish Masquerades entirely though I would have them put under new regulations and no lady should be suffered to go there halfnaked under the pretence of being better disguised nor should any one be allowed to personate  Eve  though with a figleaf As to the darling amusement of Gaming I fear it would be a vain attempt to think of restraining it within any bounds at present nor is it possible to expell the cardtable from the routes of persons of fashion even upon a Sunday I would therefore pro∣pose that since they must play the winnings on that day should be given to the poor of the parish and that they should use a particular sort of cards like those contrived for the amusement and instruction of children strewed with texts of scripture and other religious and moral sentences  GALLANTRY and intrigue may be likewise reckoned among the fashionable amusements of the present age and I confess I am at a loss to know under what restrictions to confine them Married people may perhaps be allowed to indulge themselves in any freedoms by the mutual consent of each party provided always that they are persons of distinction and that the match between them was made merely on account of family or fortune in conformity to  the true sense and spirit of the late Marriage Act With respect to those who take a pleasure in debauching raw country girls and common tradesmens daughters I had once a thought that a clause should be added to the above∣mentioned Act to oblige the offenders to do penance in a white sheet but I have since considered that our modern bucks and bloods would probably take as much pride in this badge of honour as a young officer in his scarf and cockade As to the genteel practice of keeping mistresses no one should be allowed to take a girl into keeping but those who are already past their grand climacteric and may be supposed to want a nurse except it should be thought expedient to extend this privilege to those spirited young fellows who at the age of five and twenty have worn down their constitutions to threescore  WE cannot but admire the extreme courage and sense of honour which characterises our modern heroes and inspires them sometimes with a desire of killing their friends and sometimes of killing themselves But as this noble spirit should be only exerted against the common enemy the honour of the Duellist might be satisfied I should think by a mockcombat without bloodshed and the courage of the Suicide might be confined to a bare  attempt  on his own life without the loss of it Duels therefore should be fought with guarded soils as in tragedyrencounters and any gentleman or even mechanic who finds an inclination to make away with himself may be allowed to try the expe∣riment by drawing a knife or razor across his throat so as not to cut the windpipe or by running a sword through the skin without piercing the ribs or he may flash a pistol in his face charged with powder only or be tucked up in his  own garters with a wad of cotton about his neck and his nearest relation standing by ready to cut him down if he pleases before he be quite dead  I am prevented from persuing this subject any farther in order to make room for the following letter  Mr TOWN  AS the day appointed for a General Fast in these king∣doms is now at hand I shall beg leave to touch upon some laxities in the usual manner of observing a Fast which though they are not of sufficient dignity to be taken notice of from the pulpit should yet be pointed out as the vio∣lation of the Fast in these particulars is almost universal  THE very name of a Fast implies a day of abstinence of mortification and selfdenial which has always been in∣joined as a necessary means of subduing irregular desires and fitting us for holy meditations For this reason in former days when people of quality rose earlier than even mecha∣nics now open their shops when the Court itself dined at eleven that meal was deferred till four o'clock in compliance with this religious exercise which was in those times a real abstinence a true piece of mortification and selfdenial But if the observance of a Fast consists in not dining till four o'clock our persons of fashion may be said to fast every day of their lives In truth the several hours of the day are adapted to such very different employments to what they were formerly that our four o'clock stands in the place of their eleven and nothing can be more absurd to use no harsher term than to adhere to the form in the performance of a religious act when by the alteration of circumstances  that form flatly contradicts the very meaning of its original institution I would also ask those rigid devotees who ob∣serve this day in all the strictness of the letter and would be shocked at sight of a leg of mutton or beefsteak on their tables whether the dining upon salt or other fish may not be considered rather as feasting than fasting if as is often the case it should happen to be a dish they are remarkably fond of All these methods of keeping a Fast without absti∣nence mortification or selfdenial are mere quibbles to evade the performance of our duty and entirely frustrate the design of appointing this solemnity There is some∣thing of this nature very commonly practised in  France  where there are many families who keep the whole Lent with great strictness but the last night of it invite a great deal of company to supper The moment the clock strikes twelve a magnificent entertainment consisting of all sorts of rich fare is served up and these most Christian debauchees sit down to indulge in luxury without sinning against the Canon  I am Sir your humble Servant c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CVII THURSDAY  February    Cedunt Grammatici vincuntur Rhetores  JUV  To Mr TOWN  College  Cambridge  Jan    th    SIR  I  HAVE just now with near an hundred more taken the first degree which this University confers on her sons and begin to consider within myself in what manner we have spent our time for these four years past and what profit we are likely to receive hereafter from these our academical studies But upon retrospection I find that instead of having laid up a store of learning which might have been of service to us in our future connections and intercourse with mankind we have been confounding our heads with a miscellaneous heap of nonsense which most of us I am certain are endeavouring to unlearn as  fast as possible we can instead of having acquired such a share of common sense as might have been of service to ourselves and acquaintance we must entirely sell off our old stock and begin the world of literature anew This re∣flection cannot be very pleasing to those who I must say have squandered away so very precious a time of life a time of life when though judgment perhaps is not come to maturity yet imagination and invention those noble off∣springs of a promising mind are in the very flower and bloom of perfection  THIS seat of learning for it undoubtedly deserves that name has drawn and kept us together for some years our manners conversation and studies bear a great similitude but now either chance or choice is going to disperse us over the whole kingdom and our places of abode will scarcely be more widely different than our schemes of life Notwithstanding this the same plan of study has been im∣posed on all Whether agreeable or contrary to the bent of inclination has never been regarded Mathematics is the standard to which all merit is referred and all the excellencies without these are quite overlooked and neg∣lected the solid learning of  Greece  and  Rome  is a trifling acquisition and much more so every polite accomplishment in short if you will not get all  Euclid  and his diagrams by heart and pore over  Saunderson  'till you are as blind as he was himself they will say of you as in the motto to one of your late papers  actum est ilicet peristi  Not that I would depreciate this kind of learning it is certainly a most noble science and reflects the greatest honour on human wit and invention all that I complain of is the unreason∣able stress that is laid upon it nay even the more abstruse  parts of it which is still more absurd as there are so very few heads able to perceive and retain the nice chain of reasoning and deduction which must necessarily be made use of and as a small number of mathematical geniusses would be sufficient for the service of his Majesty's dominions  I TAKE it for granted that your sagacity has by this time discovered that you have been addressed by a young man whose toooverweening conceit of himself has perhaps in∣duced him to imagine that the University has not suffi∣ciently rewarded his deserts If so you are not deceived but though this disappointment may at present set a little uneasy upon me yet I think I can foresee that it will be the most fortunate mortification that could possibly have befallen me For in the first place it has sufficiently abated that upstart pride which most young men are apt to take in their own abilities than which nothing can be more insufferable to all their acquaintance or a greater impediment to their own real improvement A pert scholar whenever he enters a room of company immediately assumes a superiority in discourse and thinks himself obliged to correct all impro∣prieties in thought or expression You must  "speak by the card"  as  Hamlet  says or expect the censure of this super∣ficial coxcomb If according to the common form of speech you say that there is either heat in fire or coldness in ice he will inform you that you deliver yourself very inaccurately as Mr  Locke  has fully demonstrated he will tell you you cannot prove that two and two make four or that you are alive yourself These and a thousand other equally impertinent observations he is continually making to the no small uneasiness and perplexity of the ladies and honest country gentlemen  WHAT is still a greater misfortune is that a man of this cast is never likely to know any better for having raked together a few metaphysical distinctions and scholastic re∣finements he thinks he has laid up a sufficient fund of knowledge for his whole life he despises all common sense which is the best sense through an ambition of appearing particular and as for the advice or opinion of others those he thinks himself indispensably bound to disregard inas∣much as such submission implies some inferiority which he would by no means be thought to labour under Such a disposition as this I take to be the sure and infallible token of confirmed ignorance a melancholy instance of the de∣pravity of human nature that the less we know the more we presume and the fewer advances we have made to∣wards true knowledge the less occasion we think we have of any further improvement  IN the second place if I may be allowed to judge of what I cannot possibly have experienced I take it to be the greatest benefit to a young person to meet with early disap∣pointments in life for sooner or later every one must have his share of them and the sooner we meet with some of them the better for by this means the mind is easily made familiar with crosses and vexations and is not thrown off its balance by every thwarting and wayward accident By this means we submit to ills and troubles as the necessary attendants on mankind just as on a rainy day we make ourselves quiet and contented but hope for sunshine on the morrow And indeed there seems to be a strong analogy between the inclemency of the weather attacking our bo∣dies and the storms of afflictions which batter our minds  The rain will beat and the wind will roar let us use our utmost endeavours to the contrary but by enuring our per∣sons to the vicissitudes of the seasons and using other pro∣per methods we shall feel no very sensible inconvenience from them In like manner all our skill and art cannot prevent or elude the rubs and disasters to which we are lia∣ble but if by degrees and early in life we are hardened and accustomed to them and if by the help of reason and sound philosophy we arm and fortify ourselves against them they may still perhaps reach us but their shocks will be quite weak and languid and we may say of Fortune as  Virgil  says of  Priam  when he hurled a javelin at  Pyrrhus  Telum imbelle sine ictu  Conjecit  THUS you see Mr TOWN that out of a seeming evil I have discovered a real good and I am certain if this me∣thod of reasoning could be made universal we should find much

escape me I bought this year the  Lady  's  Diary  merely because it was adver∣tised as the  Woman  's  Almanack  which I construed the Al∣manack composed by a Woman but I find I have been mistaken in my supposition It is not the work of a female The Christian name of the author I have reason to believe is  Marmaduke  unless I misunderstand a most curious copy of verses describing a most superb entertainment of fish flesh pies and tarts exhibited upon New Year's Day His Sirname remains as great an Aenigma as any in his book His coadjutors contributers or assistants are Messieurs  Walter Trott Timothy Nabb Patrick Ocavannah John Honey  Henry Season  and others I honour these gentlemen and their works but I own my chief delight is in reading over the Riddles and Unriddles the Questions and the Answers of Miss  Sally West Caelia  Miss  Nancy Evelyn  Miss  E S  Miss  Atkinson Enira  and other choice little feminine spirits of the age Riddles are so becoming and appear so pretty when dandled about by ladies that they may be compared to soft smooth painted waxen babbies dressed up in a pro∣per manner for Misses to play with from eighteen to four∣score But above all I must take this opportunity of congra∣tulating dear Miss  Fanny Harris  who I find  "  has given an elegant Solution to a Prize Problem by a Fluxionary Cal∣culus founded on the Properties of Tangents  "  and by that means has run away with no less than twelve Diaries for this important year As this young lady is justly called the  "honour of her sex"  and deals entirely in the Properties of Tangents I fear she will never descend so low as  Riddleme Riddlemeree  and therefore I must humbly offer by the vehi∣cle of your paper Mr TOWN a small Riddle invented with much pains and thought by myself to the

shall for the present fling together the two fol∣lowing from a number now lying before me though their subjects have no connection with each other  Mr TOWN  YOU must know Sir in my younger days I was very susceptible of the passion of love my heart was al∣ways fluttering jumping and skipping when a female object was in view and being a pretty good master of that  kind of romantic nonsense with which the fair are too often captivated being fond of dancing frisking capering and fidgeting to all public places I gained the affections of many but could settle to none and my heart constantly returned to its owner with the wound healed  IN this manner I lived till I grew past forty and think∣ing such kind of life not so agreeable but rather fatiguing I came to a resolution to marry and settle quietly in the world the remainder of my days You may guess from my general acquaintance I could not be a great while before I had an opportunity offered of meeting something suitable to my inclinations accordingly I fixed my mind on a widow lady about ten years younger than myself to whom I made known my intentions as soon as I could I was received in such a manner as all happy lovers would wish to be and at last got her promise for the completion but when I pres∣sed the day was told it could not be so soon as I desired for to surrender on so short a courtship the world might impute as an indecorum in her character  I MUST tell you I soon found like  Malvolio  in the play that she had a great passion for white silk stockings and you may be sure I always dressed my legs in that colour but as ill luck would have it some little time since having stayed with her pretty late and not being able to get either coach or chair I was forced to trudge home in the rain my cursed white stockings were wet from top to bottom the next morning the rheumatism took possession of one of my knees which not only caused an hobble in my gait but obliged me to cloath my legs with thick ribb'd worsted for the sake of warmth  THUS hobbling and cloathed I went to visit my charmer who as I entered the room was sitting in her chair more grave than usual which I imputed to her attention to do∣mestic affairs and sat down by her I took hold of her hand and was going to intrude on her lips for a kissBut would you think it Mr TOWN instead of suffering my sa∣lute she reclined her head on the chair drew her hand from mine held it up as a bar between us arose and told me I must take no such liberties in future I expostulated and was for attempting again imagining it was only a whim for you well know they all have their whims but to my great misfortune found it was real She resumed her place and in a grave manner told me I must think no more of what had passed between us that she should al∣ways have a regard for me but was determined not to marry and therefore expected I should from that time for∣bear all further pretension I earnestly as you can make no doubt pressed for reasons but could get none except broken hints such asI would not have you marryIt may hurt your constitution which seems to be very delicateI cannot turn NurseWe shall not answer each others expectationsand without any further or other ceremony she quitted the room with all the haughty airs of a fine lady who knows she has the man totally in her power  OH Mr TOWN imagine what a confused situation I was in I was thunderstruck I was overwhelmed with horror and astonishment I stood like the Soldier when he beheld the shocking condition of his General  Bellisarius  After being a long time in that condition I a little recovered my senses and with much difficulty prevailed on her maid to  follow her to her retreat and to beg the favour only to speak to her That was denied me I was told her determination was fixed she expected I would obey it and that she should be absent when I came again  I AM at present uncertain what to do I shall therefore be obliged to you if you will advise me as I can prove a promise of marriage whether I shall put the affair into the hands of my attorney or whether I shall stay till the warm weather comes which I imagine will carry off my rheu∣matism and attack her again or whether I shall pocket the disappointment and think no more of matrimony Give me some consolation if you can but if you have none I desire for the good of young batchelors like myself you would ad∣vise them all between forty and fifty not to wear white stock∣ings in winter  I am Sir your constant reader  c  TIMOTHY DOUBT  Mr TOWN  AS there are some vices which the vulgar have pre∣sumed to copy from the great so there are others which the great have condescended to borrow from the vul∣gar Among these I cannot but set down the blackguard practice for so I must call it of Cursing and Swearing a practice which to say nothing at present of its profaneness is low and indelicate and places a man of quality on the same level with the chairman at his door For my own part I cannot see the difference between a  By Gad  or a  Demme  minced and softened by a gentle pronunciation from wellbred lips and the same expression bluntly bolted out from the broad mouth of a carman or an oysterwench  YOUR predecessor the SPECTATOR has given us an account of a select party of Swearers who were extremely surprised at their own common talk which was taken down in short∣hand and afterwards repeated to them In like manner if we were to draw out a catalogue of fashionable Oaths and Curses in present use at  Arthur  's or any other polite assembly would not the company themselves be led to imagine that the conversation had been carried on between the lowest of the mob Would they not blush to find that they had gleaned their choicest phrases from streets and allies and en∣riched their discourse by the elegant dialect of  Wapping  or  Broad Saint Giles  's  I SHALL purposely wave making any reflections on the im∣piety of this practice as I am satisfied they would have but little weight either with the  beaumonde  or the  canaille  The Swearer of either station devotes himself piecemeal as it were to destruction pours out anathemas against his eyes his heart his soul and every part of his body and extends the same good wishes to the limbs and joints of his friends and acquaintance This they both do with the same fearless unconcern but with this difference only that the Gentle∣manSwearer damns himself and others with the greatest ci∣vility and goodbreeding imaginable  I KNOW it will be pleaded in excuse for this practice that Oaths and Curses are intended only as mere expletives to fill up and give a grace to conversation but as there are still some oldfashioned creatures who adhere to their common acceptation it would be proper to substitute some other un∣meaning terms in their room and at the same time remote from the vulgar Cursing and Swearing A worthy clergy∣man  whose name I cannot recollect being chaplain of a regiment is said to have reclaimed the officers who were much addicted to the vulgar idiom of swearing by taking occasion to tell them a story in which he introduced the words  bottle and glass  instead of the usual expletives of  God Devil  and  damn  which he did not think quite so becoming for one of  his cloth  to make free with The same method might I imagine be followed by our people of fashion whenever they are obliged to have recourse to the like substi∣tutes for thought  Bottle and glass  might be used with great energy in the tabletalk at the  King's Arms  or  Saint Alban's  ta∣verns the gamester might be indulged in swearing by the  Knave of Clubs  or the  Curse of Scotland  or he might with some propriety retain the old execration of  the Deuce take it  the beau should be allowed to  "swear by his gracious self which is the god of his idolatry"  and the common ex∣pletives of conversation should consist only of  upon my word  or  upon my honour  which whatever sense they might for∣merly bear are at present understood only as words of course without meaning  I am SIR Your humble Servant  c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CIX THURSDAY  February    Prudens futuri temporis exitum  Caliginosâ nocte premit Deus  Ridetque si mortalis ultra  Fas trepidat  HOR  I  T is not easy for the mind of man to recover itself from any extraordinary panic which has once seized it for this reason we can∣not be surprised that many wellmeaning people who have not yet shook off the ap∣prehensions occasioned by the late dreadful earthquakes should be led to conjure up new terrors and alarm them∣selves with imaginary dangers Their fears interpret every common incident and even the change of weather as signs of approaching destruction if the day be calm and serene such they say is the usual forerunner of a shock or if the  night prove tempestuous they can hardly persuade them∣selves that it is only the wind which rocks their houses With this propensity to entertain any unreasonable dread about future events it is no wonder that weak minds should be further worked upon by little dablers in philoso∣phy who having gleaned a few barren scraps from the Magazines presume even to foretell the dissolution of the world by the Comet which will appear in  Swift  in his  Voyage to Laputa  has a passage so very apposite to these idle pretenders to science that I shall beg leave to transcribe it  THESE people says he are under continual disqui∣etudes never enjoying a minute's peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals Their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies For instance that the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in course of time be absorbed or swallowed up That the face of the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more light to the world That the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes and that the next which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence will probably de∣stroy us For if in its perihelion it should approach with∣in a certain degree of the sun as by their calculations they have reasons to dread it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of one hun∣dred thousand miles from the  nucleus  or main body of  the comet it must in its passage be set on fire and re∣duced to ashes That the sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attend∣ed with the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light from it  THEY are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements of life When they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question is about the sun's health how he looked at his setting and rising and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of an approaching comet This conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for fear  LET us therefore banish from our thoughts all such vain notions and let us fortify our minds with a true sense of religion which will teach us to rely on the protection of that providence which has hitherto preserved us It is with great pleasure that I remarked the unanimous concur∣rence of all ranks of people in observing the late solemn Fast as a necessary act of humiliation to avert the wrath and vengeance of heaven and to call down its mercies upon us nor do I doubt but the approaching Season will awaken in us the same serious attention to our duty that we may not seem to have barely complied with a stated form or to have been affected with the shortlived piety of a single day  IT is true indeed that no persons do more prejudice to the cause of religion than they who cloud its genuine chearfulness with the gloom of superstition and are apt to consider every common accident that befalls us as a judg∣ment They cloath religion in the most terrifying habit and as it were dress it up in all the horrors of the Inquisition These people are much to be pitied and it is to be wished that their mistaken piety could be better regulated But there is another set of men of a different turn more nume∣rous and much more dangerous to the community who treat every act of religion as a jest and hold its most sacred ordinances in contempt Set forms and ceremonies though they have no essential virtue in themselves are yet indispen∣sably requisite to keep alive in us a quick sense of our duty It must be allowed indeed that if a man could constantly employ his mind in holy meditations exercise the virtues and believe the mysteries of our religion he would be a true Christian though he never complied with any outward forms or so much as repeated a single prayer But it is manifest from experience that those who neglect the ordi∣nances neglect also the duties of a Christian and the least reflection on the human mind will convince us that some external rites are necessary to settle the wandering ideas and to fix the attention on its proper object The fervent re∣petition of a prayer is apt to inspire us with love and gra∣titude towards the DEITY and kindles the sparks of devo∣tion within us and it is easy to conceive that if the cele∣bration of public worship was neglected among us only for one year it would be a more fatal blow to religion than all the weak attacks of infidels and freethinkers No argu∣ments therefore could be more illgrounded than the ob∣jections  of those people who considered the appointment of the late solemn fast as useless and unnecessary  BUT though forms may be said to compose the body a good life is the soul of religion without which the rest is but a dead mass The most rigid compliance with every ordinance of the Church if it has no influence on our con∣duct is rather a solemn mockery than an attonement for our offences as they who receive the bread and wine without a firm resolution to lead a new life are said to eat and drink their own damnation Wherefore a strict observance of this or that particular day is not a sufficient discharge of our duty except it serve to rouze us from the lethargy of sin to awaken in us a desire of becoming worthy the protection of the ALMIGHTY by animating our faith amending our lives and working in us a repentance of our transgressions Thus the Lord's Day is not merely set apart for devotion with an unlimited licence to wickedness all the rest of the week but our being particularly exercised in acts of piety for one day is calculated to strengthen our virtue and to give a tincture of religion to our whole conduct through the other six  THESE considerations I have thought fit to lay before the reader as preparatory to another solemn Fast ordained by the Church and if the observance of this should be neg∣lected or slightly passed over may we not conclude that our sense of religion is only in proportion to our sense of danger As for those who require constantly to be fright∣ened into their duty I will for once venture to commence prophet and let them be assured that my predictions will in∣fallibly come to pass There is a danger more certain than an  Earthquake or a Comet which will inevitably overwhelm us from which we cannot possibly guard ourselves and which perhaps is even now at our doors This danger I cannot better set forth than in the alarming words of a ce∣lebrated  French  preacher  "I know a man and I will point him out presently who is now in this church a man in perfect health a man in the flower of his age And yet this man perhaps before next Sunday perhaps by tomorrow will be in his grave This man my dear brethren is Myself who speak to you it is You who hear me"  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CX THURSDAY  March    Hoc opus hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli  Si volumus patriae si nobis vivere chart  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  E  VERY  Englishman  who has the good of his country at heart must lament the per∣plexity which our ministers labour under in contriving ways and means to raise money for the present exigence of affairs I have with pleasure hearkened to the several projects proposed in the debates of patriots in our coffeehouses and private clubs but though I find they are unanimous in allowing the neces∣sity of levying new taxes every one is willing to shift off the burthen from himself  I WAS introduced the other night into a set of worthy citi∣zens who very zealously took this subject into consideration over their evening pipe One of them a grave gentleman pulling the  Evening Post  out of his pocket and putting on his spectacles read aloud to us the several methods already proposed to which many wise objections were immediately started by the company  "What's that says an old don who I afterwards found had a small estate in houses An additional duty upon bricks and pantiles and plaintiles I suppose they will lay a tax upon plaintilepegs by and bye"  This speech was received with an hearty chuckle of applause from the rest of the company when another took occasion to observe  "that he very much approved the scheme for laying a larger tax upon cards and dice one of which he called the  devil's books  and the other his  bones  "  The duty upon plate might perhaps have passed into a law in this assembly if it had not been vehe∣mently opposed by one member whom I discovered to be a silversmith in which he was seconded by the landlord of the house who had a seat in this meeting and told us  "that it would lye very hard upon publicans as nobody would now drink their porter out of a pewterpot"  These and the like arguments induced us to set aside all the pro∣jects that had been offered hitherto and to consult together in order to find new ones in their room among which I could not but smile at the proposal of an honest perukema∣ker who advised the levying of a polltax upon all that wore their own hair  "For says he we have never had good times since wigs were out of fashion What rare days were those in Queen  Anne  's reign when the nobility and gentry wore large flaxen flows of thirty guineas price And  as you may see in my lord  Godolphin  's monument in  West∣minster  Abby a prime minister's wig could not be made I am sure under fifty guineas"  THE discourse that passed at this society of politicians has led me to turn my thoughts on devising some method that might answer the present demands for a supply with the least injury to the community On this account I am of Opinion that private vices according to the favourite tenet of  Maun∣derville  may in some measure be converted into public benefits by laying a certain tax or duty on the fashionable amusements of the gay and polite world For this purpose I have with great pains and labour contrived a plan a few heads of which without further preface I shall with your leave submit to the consideration of those whom it may concern  FIRST then I would propose that no persons of quality or others should be allowed to keep any route drum as∣sembly visitingday or whatever other name it may here∣after be called by at which more than one hundred persons shall be found assembled without paying a certain rate for every such route drum c The number of these meet∣ings which are held in this town including the city of  London  and the suburbs thereof I have computed upon an exact calculation to amount annually to eight thousand three hundred and upwards so that if a duty at only sixpence  per  head were to be levied upon the company it would bring in a prodigious income to the government deducting for the decrease consequent of this tax as also for those which we may expect will be smuggled or carried on clandes∣tinely And as gaming is an essential diversion at all these meetings I would further advise that every cardtable be  marked and numbered in the same manner as waggons and coaches and a proportionable rate fixed on them according to the degree and quality of the owners Be it enacted moreover that extraordinary licences shall be taken out for playing at cards on the Sabbathday but that these be granted only to persons of the highest rank and fashion  AT the present juncture of affairs every one will agree with me that if an absolute prohibition be impracticable an heavy duty should be laid on the importation of  French  fashions and fopperies into this kingdom It is therefore but reasonable that all  French  cooks valets de chambre mil∣liners mantuamakers haircutters c should be at least doubly taxed as it is notorious that they exact from the dupes who employ them more than double the wages or price for their labours that our own modest countrymen would re∣quire This tax I make no doubt would produce no incon∣siderable sum for the public use and as our ladies though I would not suspect that they have  French  hearts are ambi∣tious of wearing  French  complexions a further sum might also be raised by fixing an high duty upon  rouge  and  carmine  I SHALL not dwell on other particulars which might be turned in the same manner to the public good such as a tax on kept mistresses for example which practice is now become so generally fashionable that I question not but a duty properly levied on them would be sufficient to maintain all the widows of our soldiers and sailors who shall happen to be killed in the service But as it is incumbent on every  Englishman  to expose his life in defence of his country against the common enemy I must particularly re∣commend that some means may be devised that the gallant  feats of those men of honour who rather chuse to risk their lives in the modish way of duelling may be attended with some advantage to their countrymen I would therefore ad∣vise that swords and pistols of a settled length and bore with the Towerstamp be provided by the government for the use of Duellists and that they shall not presume to make use of any other under pain of incurring the guilt of murder These weapons may be let out at a certain price and if one of the parties happen to kill the other the sur∣vivor shall be subject to a fine according to his rank and station and a jury shall be directed to bring in the ver∣dict  SelfDefence  In like manner persons of quality may have leave granted them to put an end to their own lives after an ill luck at cards or the like emergent occa∣sions when upon paying a certain rate they may be in∣dulged in a private execution from the hands of  Jack Ketch  and the Coroner's inquest shall be directed to bring in their verdict  Lunacy  I am SIR Your humble Servant  c

ladies of the present age dislike no company so much as the elderly persons of their own sex whether married or unmarried Go∣ing with an old maiden aunt a mamma or grandmamma to the play or to  Ranelagh  is so insipid an amusement that it robs their entertainment of the very name of a party of pleasure To be handed into a box walk in the public gardens or make one at a cardtable at a route with a sprightly young nobleman or gallant colonel of the guards has some life in it but to be kept perpetually under the wing of an old lady can have no charms for a woman of spirit The presence of these antiquated females imposes a constraint on their behaviour they are indeed like the  Duennas  in  Spain  spies on the conduct of the gay and young and a good old gentlewoman with a young beauty by her side watches her every motion and is as much frighted if the pretty creature makes any advances to a man as a hen who has been fostermother to a brood of duck∣lings is alarmed at their taking to the water  BUT though a loose coquet behaviour is so much in vogue a modest deportment is most natural and becoming in the fair sex and I am always glad to see a young lady of sufficient sense and discretion to behave with an innocent chearfulness instead of apparent uneasiness and constraint before her more aged female friends and relations But though a daughter should prefer no company to her mother a son would appear as ridiculous if he always dangled at the side of his mamma as if he wore his sister's petticoats and however amiable this maidenly demeanor might seem in a young girl I cannot view it with equal approbation in the character of a MaleVirgina character with which I shall here present the reader as drawn by one of my cor∣respondents  To Mr TOWN  SIR  YOU have already given us several instances of those am∣biguous creatures among the men who are both male and female permit me to add to them an account of those ladylike gentlemen whom we may distinguish by the title of  their mother's own sons  who have in vain changed the bib and leadingstrings for the breeches and stick as close to their mammas as a great calf to the side of an old cow I am intimately acquainted with one of these overgrown ba∣bies  who is indeed too big to be dandled in lap or fed with a papspoon though he is no more weaned from his mother than if he had not yet quitted the nursery  THE delicate BILLY SUCKLING is the contempt of the men the jest of the women and the darling of his mamma She doats on him to distraction and is in perpetual admi∣ration of his wit and anxiety for his health The good young gentleman for his part is neither undutiful nor un∣grateful she is the only woman that he does not look on with indifference and she is his tutoress his physician and his nurse She provides his broth every evening will not suffer him to look into a book by candlelight lest he should hurt his eyes and takes care to have his bed warmed nay I have known him sit with his mamma's white hand∣kerchief round his neck through a whole visit to guard him from the wind of that  ugly door  or that  terrible chink in the wainscot  BUT however familiarly he may behave in his addresses to his mother and whatever little acts of gallantry may pass between them no encouragement can prevail on him to treat other women with the same freedom Being once de∣sired at a ball to dance a minuet instead of taking out any of the young ladies he could pitch upon no partner so agree∣able to whom he might offer the compliment of his hand as his mother and I remember when he was once called upon in a large company at a tavern to give a lady in his turn he plainly shewed who was the sole mistress of his affections by toasting his mother The gallant custom of challenging a lady to drink a bumper by leaving it to her option whether she will have  hob  or  nob  frequently gives a  delicious flavour to the liquor especially when as I have known it happen joining the lips of the glasses has made the prelude to a meeting between the lips of the parties but he could not be prevailed on to accept a glass of claret from the fairest hand though a kiss were sure to follow it I have known him so very nice as to refuse a glass of sack filled with walnuts which had been peeled by the snowy fingers of a beautiful young lady though I have seen him smack his lips after a glass of raisin wine in which his prudent mother had been dabbling with her snuffy finger in order to fish out the small particles of cork which might possibly have choaked him If a lady drops her fan he sits without any emotion and suffers her to stoop for it herself or if she strikes her teacup against the saucer to give notice that it is empty he pays no regard to the signal but sees her walk up to the teatable without stirring from his chair He would rather leave the most celebrated beauty in crossing the street to the mercy of a drayman than trust her with his little finger though at the same time should his mother be so distressed he would not scruple to bear as much of her weight as he could stand under and to redeem her silk stockings from jeopardy would even expose his own  ONE would imagine that this extreme coyness and re∣serve in which he so remarkably differs from the generality of his own sex would in another respect as effectually distin∣guish him from the generality of women I mean that being less polite in his address than a footman we should hardly ex∣pect to find him more loquacious than a chambermaid But this is really the case Suffer him to take the lead in conver∣sation and there are certain topicks in which the most  prating gossip at a christening would find it difficult to cope with him The strength of his constitution is his favourite theme he is constantly attempting to prove that he is not susceptible of the least injury from cold though a hoarse∣ness in his voice and the continual interruptions of a con∣sumptive cough give him the lye in his throat at the end of every sentence The instances indeed by which he endeavours to prove his hardiness unluckily rather tend to convince us of the delicacy of his frame as they seldom amount to more than his having kicked off the bedchoaths in his sleep laid aside one of his flannel waistcoats in a hot day or tried on a new pair of pumps before they had been sufficiently aired For the truth of these facts he always appeals to his mamma who vouches for him with a sigh and protests that his carelessness would ruin the constitution of a horse  I AM now coming to the most extraordinary part of his character This pusillanimous creature thinks himself and would be thought a Buck The noble fraternity of that order find that their reputation can be no otherwise main∣tained than by prevailing on an  Irish  chairman now and then to favour them with a broken head or by conferring the same token of their esteem on the unarmed and defence∣less waiters at a tavern But these exploits are by no means suited to the disposition of our hero and yet he always looks upon his harmless exploits as the bold frolicks of a Buck If he escapes a nervous fever a month he is quite a Buck if he walks home after it is dark without his mamma's maid to attend him he is quite a Buck if he sits up an hour later than his usual time or drinks a glass or two of wine without water he calls it a debauch and because his  head does not ache the next morning he is quite a Buck In short a woman of the least spirit within the precincts of  St James  's would demolish him in a week should be pretend to keep pace with her in her irregularities and yet he is ever dignifying himself with the appellation of a Buck  NOW might it not be giving this gentleman a useful hint Mr TOWN to assure him that while milk and water is his darling liquor a Bamboo cane his Club and his mother the sole object of his affections the world will never join in denominating him a Buck That if he fails in this attempt he is absolutely excluded from every order in society for whatever his deserts may be no assembly of antiquated virgins can ever acknowledge him for a sister nature having as deplorably disqualified him for that rank in the commu∣nity as he has disqualified himself for every other And that though he never can arrive at the dignity of leading apes in hell he may possibly be condemn'd to dangle in that capacity at the apronstring of an old maid in the next world for having so abominably resembled one in this  I am SIR Your humble Servant  c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXII THURSDAY  March    Aureus axis erat temo aureus aurea summae  Curvatura rotae radiorum argenteus ordo  Per juga chrysolithi positaeque ex ordine gemmae  OVID  To Mr  TOWN  SIR  I  T has for a long time been observable that the ladies heads have run much upon wheels but of late there has appeared a strange kind of inversion for the wheels now run upon the ladies heads As this assertion may probably puzzle many readers who pay no attention to the rapid and whimsical revolutions of modern taste it will be necessary to inform them that instead of a cap the present mode is for every female of fashion to load her head  with some kind of carriage whether they are made with broad wheels or not I cannot determine however as they are undoubtedly excluded the Turnpike Act it is by no means material Those heads which are not able to bear a coach and six for vehicles of this sort are very apt to crack the brain so far act consistently with prudence as to make use of a post chariot or a single horse chaise with a beau perching in the middle  THE curiosity I had of knowing the purport of this inven∣tion and the general name of these machines led me to make enquiry about them of a fashionable milliner at the court end of the town She obliged me with the sight of one of these equipages designed for the head of a lady of quality which I surveyed with much admiration and pla∣cing it on the palm of my hand could not help fancying myself like  Gulliver  taking up the Empress of  Lilliput  in her statecoach The vehicle itself was constructed of gold threads and was drawn by six dapple greys of blown glass with a coachman postilion and gentleman within of the same brittle manufacture Upon further enquiry the milli∣ner told me with a smile that it was difficult to give a reason for inventions so full of whim but that the name of this ornament if it may be called such was a  Capriole  or  Ca∣briole  which we may trace from the same original with our  English  word  Caprice  both being derived from the  French  word  cabrer  which signifies  to prance like an horse  IT is not to be doubted but that this fashion took its rise among the ladies from their fondness for equipage and I dare say that every fair one who carries a coach and six upon her head would be glad to be carried with equal splen∣dor  in a coach of her own I would therefore propose a scheme which might render this whimsical mode of some kind of service to both sexes by which the ladies may give a tacit hint of their inclinations without the least breach of modesty the men may prevent the danger and inconvenience attending the present method of advertising for wives and the whole course of a modern courtship may be carried on by means of this new headdress  INSTEAD of a  Capriole  suppose this capital decoration was called a  Scutcheon  of  Pretence  which must not here be un∣derstood as a Term of  Heraldry  but as an invitation to ma∣trimony Thus if a lady presumes that she has a right either from her wit beauty merit or fortune to pretend to a set of horses let six bright bays blacks or greys prance down one side of her head and according to the rank she insists upon let a ducal or an earl's coronet or a bloody hand be distinguished upon her  Capriole  The females of less ambition may likewise express their inclinations by a post∣chariot and pair and even those who from a due consi∣deration of the low condition of the funds are so con∣descending as to stoop to a plain cit have nothing to do but to fix upon their heads a single horse chaise filled with a loving couple sticking as close together as two dried figs As to those who have rashly vowed virginity if their great proneness to censure the rest of their sex and the fretfulness of their aspect be not sufficient indications to keep the men at a distance they may erect upon their noddles a formal female seated in a Sulky foolishly pleased with having the whole vehicle to herself and awkwardly exercising the imaginary power of having the sole command of the reins  AS a farther means of facilitating this new method of courtship I must beg leave to propose that every lady's bosom should instead of a pendent cross which savours of popery be ornamented with a chain and locket something like those bottletickets which direct us to port claret or burgundy upon which might be curiously engraved the numbers two hundred five hundred or a thousand accord∣ing to the settlement expected But to those female  Quixotes  who scorn the  Capriole  and erect  Windmills  upon their heads instead of it I shall offer a word of advice worthy their atten∣tion which is that they would provide a pipe of commu∣nication to be conveyed from these machines to the brain and constituted upon the model of the ingenious Dr  Hale  's ventilators that whenever the sails of the Windmill are put into motion by the external air they may draw off all pernicious vapours which may occasion a vertigo in the inside as well as on the outside of their heads  I am Sir your humble servant H  I AM much pleased with the proposal of my ingenious correspondent and think it particularly well adapted to the present disposition of the ladies A fondness for showy equipages is now become one of their darling passions and the splendor in which they are to be maintained seems to be one of the chief considerations in modern matches If a fine lady can be carried to court in a chair richly ornamented or roll to the opera in a gilt chariot she little considers with how disagreeable a companion she goes through the journey of life and a polite female would no more fix her affections on a man who drives but a beggarly pair than she could be content to be tumbled down to his country seat like  Punch  's wife to  Rumford  in a wheelborrow  BUT as the ladies have strongly manifested this passion for equipage the gentlemen I suppose out of mere gal∣lantry and in order to further the gratification of their de∣sires have taken great pains to convert themselves into coachmen grooms and jockies The flapped hat the jemmy frock with plate buttons and a leathern belt and the pride which some young men of quality take in driving are all calculated the better to qualify them for being the ladies humble servants I am therefore for extending my corre∣spondent's scheme and as the ladies now adorn their heads with the sign of a coach and six like the door of a  Meuse  alehouse I would have the gentlemen also bear these emble∣matical vehicles by which the other sex may by a single glance at a lover's head see in what state they will be sup∣ported as we know a clergyman by his rose or an officer by his cockade  THE pretty fellows who study dress might shew a great deal of invention in suiting their  Caprioles  to their circum∣stances Any nobleman or gentleman who has the honour to be a  Knowing one  might shew his affection for the turf by carrying the horse and jockey another who is an excellent driver might bear his own figure exalted in a  Phaeton  and a third who thinks of picking up a partner for life that can be pleased with a  têteatête  or sober picpuet party with her husband may bear a  visàvis  In a word all the different proposals of various suitors might be made by means of these ornaments which might be worn over the foreheads of the beaux like the white horse in the grenadiers caps and the ladies might be as much smitten with a promising  Capriole  on the head of a lover as heretofore with an elegant perriwig  IF this mode should prevail the concluding a treaty of marriage between two persons of quality might be considered in the same light and expressed in the same terms as  making a match  at  Newmarket  and instead of the hackneyed phrases at present used by our newswriters we might perhaps see the important articles in the public papers concerning mar∣riages drawn up after the following manner  We hear that a match will be shortly made between the mourning coach and six of a merchant's widow with a great jointure and an hunter in fine order belonging to a younger brother of a noble family  A running horse highly valued for his blood is expected to start soon with a young filly from Yorkshire Many thousand pounds are depending on this match  A few days ago a young fellow from  Ireland  mounted on a single horse attacked an heiress in her coach and six The lady made little or no resistance and suffered herself to be taken out of the coach and carried off behind him  A gay coach and six belonging to a young heir just of age came to town last week in great splendor and was in∣tended to be matched with an equipage of the same kind but having unfortunately run against  Arthur  's chocolatehouse it broke down and the owner was very much hurt  We hear from  Bath  that the postchaise of a young lady of great beauty lately made its appearance in the long room and soon after went off with the landau of a neighbouring country squire  We are also informed from the same place that an old∣fashioned twowheel chaise with a single horse contrived to hold only one person had drove about the walks for some time but having jostled against the Sulky of an old batchelor in his grand climacteric it was judged expedient to join them together when they formed a most agreeable  visavis  for the mutual accommodation of both parties  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXIII THURSDAY  March    O sanctas gentes quibus haec nascuntur in hortis  Numina  JUV  V  IRTU is almost the only instance in which the appearance of literary knowledge is affected in the present age and our per∣sons of rank acquire just enough scholarship to qualify themselves for  Connoisseurs  These sort of students become sufficiently acquainted with the cus∣toms of the ancients to learn the least interesting par∣ticulars concerning them They can distinguish a  Tiberius  from a  Trajan  know the  Pantheon  from the  Amphitheatre  and can explain the difference between the  praetexta  and the  tunica  which only supposing the present times to have elapsed some hundred years is just as deep knowledge as if  some future antiquarian should discover the difference between a  Carolus  and an  Anna  or St  Paul's  church and  DruryLane  playhouse or a fulltrimmed suit and a  French  frock  BUT the full display of modern polite learning is exhi∣bited in the decorations of parks gardens c and centered in that important monosyllable Taste Taste comprehends the whole circle of the polite arts and sheds its influence on every lawn avenue grassplat and parterre Taste has peopled the walks and gardens of the great with more nu∣merous inhabitants than the ancient Satyrs Fauns and Dry∣ads While infidelity has expunged the Christian Theology from our creed Taste has introduced the heathen Mytho∣logy into our gardens If a pond is dug  Neptune  at the command of Taste emerges from the bason and presides in the middle or if a vista is cut through a grove it must be terminated by a  Flora  or an  Apollo  As the ancients held that every spot of ground had its guardian Genius and that woodland deities were pegged in the knotty entrails of every tree so in the gardens laid out by modern Taste every walk is peopled with gods and goddesses and every corner of it has its tutelardeity Temples are erected to all the train of gods and goddesses mentioned in  Homer  or  Ovid  which edifices as well as their several statues are adorned with  Latin  or  Greek  inscriptions while the learned owner won∣ders at his own surprising stock of literature which he sees drawn out at large before him like the whole knowledge of an apothecary inscribed upon his gallipots  THESE persons of Taste may be considered as a sort of learned idolaters since they may be almost said to adore these graven images and are quite enthusiastic in their veneration  of them The following letter may possibly give them some offence but as I have myself no extravagant fondness for a  Jupiter Tonans  or a  Belvidere Apollo  I heartily wish the scheme proposed by my correspondent may take place though it should reduce the price of heathen godheads  To Mr TOWN  SIR  AT a time when all wise heads are considering of ways and means to raise taxes that may prove the least oppressive to indigence and most effectually restrictive of luxury permit me to propose as a supplement to the thoughts of one of your correspondents on this subject a national tax upon Gods  IT is a strange but an undeniable truth Mr TOWN that if you and I were to travel through  England  and to visit the citizen in his country box the nobleman at his seat the esquire at the hallhouse and even the divine at his parsonage we should find the gardens avenues and groves belonging to each mansion stuffed and ornamented with Heathen Gods  IN the present declining state of our established religion I almost tremble to consider what may be the consequences of these readymade deities Far be it from me to suppose that the great and the rich will worship any God what∣soever but still I am induced to fear that the poor and the vulgar when they find all other worship ridiculed and laid aside may foolishly take to these molten images and adore every leaden godhead they can find If a tax on wheels has put down some hundreds of coaches by a parity of reason a tax upon gods may pull down an equal if not a greater  number of statues I would also offer another proposal which is this That an oak be immediately planted whereever a statue has been taken away by which means those vast woods which of late years have been cut down in  England  to supply the immediate necessities of the illustrious  Arthurites  in St  James  'sstreet may be in some measure supplied to future generations  AMONG our present taxes some of them fall upon branches of splendor not totally luxurious Wheel carriages may be necessary want of health or lameness of limbs may require them but what necessities can we pretend for statues in our gardens  Penates  in our libraries and  Lares  on every chimneypiece I have remarked many wild whims of this kind that have appeared submissions if not attachments to idolatry A gentleman of my acquaintance has destroyed his chapel merely because he could not put up statues in it and has filled his garden with every god that can be found in  Spence  's  Polymetis  Another of my friends after having placed a  Belvidere Apollo  very conspicuously and na∣ked upon the top of a mount has erected an Obelisk to the Sun and this expence he has not put himself to for the beauty of the Obelisk for it is not beautiful nor again for the splendor of the planet which is of pewter double gilt but only because being in possession of copies or originals of every deity that  Greece  or  Italy  could boast he was resolved to have the God of  Persia  to compleat his collection A polltax therefore upon gods and goddesses be their repre∣sentation what it will Suns Dogs Moons or Monkies is absolutely necessary and would infallibly bring in a large re∣venue to the state  HAPPENING to be the other day at  Slaughter  's coffee∣house in St  Martin's Lane  I saw two very fine statues of  Fame  and  Fortune  brought out of Mr  Roubilliac  's gate and exposed to view before they were nailed up and carted The boy of the house told us they were to be placed upon the top of Sir  Thomas  's chapel in  Hampshire  "Is it for such as these observed a sneering papist who stood near me that crucifixes have been removed and that re∣verend saints and martyrs have been destroyed and pounded into dust Is it for these that St  Peter  has been broken to pieces and St  Paul  melted down into water pipes Must  Our Lady  make room for  Proserpine  And the holy giant St  Christopher  fall a victim to the  Farnesian Hercules  Will you not agree with me Sir continued he that as men are induced and almost constrained to judge of others by their own manners and inclinations we who are sup∣posed to worship the images of christians must naturally conclude that the protestants of the Church of  England  worship the images of heathens"  I confess I was at a loss how to answer the acuteness of his questions and must own that I cannot help thinking St  Anthony  preaching to the fishes or St  Dunstan  taking the Devil by the nose as pro∣per ornaments for a chapel as any Pagan deities whatever  HITHERTO I have kept you entirely among the molten images without doors but were we to enter the several mansions whose avenues and demesnes are adorned in the manner I describe we should find every chamber a pagod filled with all the monstrous images that the idolatry of  India  can produce I will not presume to infer that the ladies address  Kitoos  prayers which the  Japanese  make use of in  time of public distress to their  Ingens  but I am apt to sur∣mise that in times of danger and invasion some of your fair readers would be more alarmed at the  French  approach to their china than to their chapels and would sooner give up a favourite lapdog than a grotesque chimneypiece figure of a  Chinese  saint with numberless heads and arms I have not yet digested my thoughts in what manner the fair sex ought to be taxed It is a tender point and requires consi∣deration At present I am of opinion they ought to be spared and the whole burthen entirely laid upon those  Bramins  and  Imams  whose idolatrous temples lie publickly open to our streets  I am SIR Your most humble Servant MOSES ORTHODOX  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXIV THURSDAY  April    Vesanum tetigisse timent fugiuntque poetam  HOR  I  REMEMBER when I was very young a re∣lation carried me to visit a gentleman who had wrote some pieces that had been very well received and made me very happy by promising to introduce me to an Author As soon as I came I surveyed his whole person from top to toe with the strictest attention sat openmouthed to catch every syllable that he uttered and noticed his voice manner and every word and gesture with the minutest observation I could not help whispering to myself the whole evening  "I am in company with an Author"  and waited with the most anxious impatience to hear him deliver something that  might distinguish him from the rest of mankind The gentleman behaved with great chearfulness and politeness but he did not at all answer the idea which I had conceived of an Author and I went away exceedingly disappointed because I could not find any striking difference between him and the rest of my acquaintance  THERE is no character in human life which is the sub∣ject of more frequent speculation among the vulgar than an Author Some look on him with contempt and others with admiration but they all agree in believing him to be something different from all other people and it is re∣markable with what greediness they attend to any little an∣ecdotes which they can pick up concerning his life and con∣versation He is indeed a kind of an ideal being of which people conceive very different notions By some he is supposed never to stir out of a garret to wear a rusty black coat dirty shirt and darned stockings and to want all the necessaries as well as conveniences of life while others regard him as a creature superior to the rest of mortals and endowed with something more than reason One part therefore is surprised to see him walk abroad and appear as well dressed as other people and another is disappointed when they find him talk and act and fill the offices of life no better than any other common man  NOR is it less curious to consider the different ideas they conceive of the manner in which the business of writing is executed The novice in literature smit with the love of sacred song but not yet dipt in ink supposes it all rapture and enthusiasm and in imagination sees the Author running wildly about his room talking poetry to the chairs and ta∣bles  while the mechanick considers him as working at his trade and thinks he can set down to write whenever he pleases as easily as the smith can labour at his forge or a carpenter plane a board Indeed he regards the Author with some veneration as a scholar but writing appears to him a mighty easy business and he smiles whenever he hears any body mention the labour of it nor has he the least concep∣tion of the mind's being fatigued with thinking and the fancy harrassed with persuing a long train of ideas  AS people are led frequently to judge of a man from his ordinary conversation so it is common for them to form an idea of the author's disposition from the peculiar turn and colour of his writings they expect a gloom to be spread over the face of a mathematician a controversial writer must be given to wrangling and dispute and they imagine that a satirist must be made up of spleen envy and illnature But this criterion is by no means certain and determinate I know an author of a tragedy who is the merriest man living and one who has wrote a very witty comedy though he will sit an hour in company without speaking a word Lord  Buckhurst  is celebrated for being  "the best good man with the worstnatured muse"  and Mr  Addison  was remarkably shy and reserved in conversation I remember I once fell into company with a painter a poet a divine and a physician who were no less famous for their wit and humour than for their excellence in their several professi∣ons After the usual common topics were discussed the physician and the poet fell into a dispute concerning pre∣destination the divine smoked his pipe quietly without put∣ting in a word while the painter and myself formed a privy  council for the good of the nation Thus were it possible to conjure up the spirits of the most eminent wits in former ages and put them together they would perhaps appear to be very dull company  Virgil  and  Addison  would probably sit staring at each other without opening their mouths  Horace  and  Steele  would perhaps join in commendation of the liquor and  Swift  would in all likelihood divert him∣self with sucking his cheeks drawing figures in the wine spilt upon the table or twirling the corkscrew round his finger  THE strange prejudices which some persons conceive against Authors deter many a youth from drawing his pen in the service of literature or if he ventures to commit a favourite work to the press he steals to the printer's with as much caution and privacy as he would perhaps on ano∣ther occasion to a surgeon He is afraid that he shall in∣jure his character by being known to have written any thing and that the genteel part of his acquaintance will despise him as a low wretch as soon as they discover him to be an Author as if merely the appearing in print was a dis∣grace to a gentleman and the  imprimatur  to his works was no more than a stamp of shame and ignominy These are the terrors which at first disturb the peace of almost every Au∣thor and have often put me in mind of the exclamation of that writer who cried out  "O that mine enemy had writ∣ten a book"  THESE fearful apprehensions are perhaps no unlucky drawback on the vanity natural to all Authors which un∣doubtedly they often conceal or suppress out of deference to the world but if this false modesty is too much che∣rished  it must of course damp all genius and discourage every literary undertaking Why should it be disgraceful to exert the noblest faculties given us by nature and why should any man blush at acquitting himself well in a work which there is scarce one in five hundred has a capacity to perform Even supposing an Author to support himself by the profit arising from his works there is nothing more dis∣honest scandalous or mean in it than an officer in the army the politest of all professions living on his commission Sense and genius are as proper commodities to traffick in as courage and an Author is no more to be condemned as an hackney scribbler though he writes at the rate of so much  per  sheet than a Colonel should be despised as a mercenary and a bravo for exposing himself to be slashed stuck and shot at for so much  per  day The truth is that Authors themselves often create the evils they complain of and bring a disgrace on the service of literature by being ashamed to wear the badge of it  Voltaire  in his  letters on the  English relates a remarkable instance of this kind of false pride in our own  Congreve Voltaire  when he was in  England  waited on  Congreve  and told him that he was glad of an opportunity of paying his respects to a writer so much cele∣brated for his wit and humour  Congreve  received him po∣litely enough but told him that he should be glad to see him as a common gentleman but would not be considered or conversed with as an Author The  French  writer was a good deal surprised at such a ridiculous piece of delicacy and could not help telling him that he thought this nicety some∣thing extraordinary for that if he had been no more than a common gentleman he should never have had any desire of seeing him  I HAVE often pleased myself with reflecting on the differ∣ent opinions which my readers must have formed of me since my first appearance as an Author As poverty is one of the general characteristics of our brotherhood those who indulge themselves in a contempt of writers have I doubt  not often painted me to their own imagination in a very grotesque taste Their ideal caricatures have perhaps often re∣presented me lodged at least three stories from the ground composing dissertations on the modern taste in architecture at another time I may have been delineated sitting in a tat∣tered nightgown and the breeches of a heathen philosopher writing satires on the present modes in dress and sometimes perhaps they have figured me half starved for want of a hearty meal penning invectives against luxury and de∣bauchery  BUT while these have reduced me to this low condition and  "steeped me in poverty to the very lips"  I flatter my∣self that some few have bestowed on me an extraordinary share of virtue and understanding After so many grave les∣sons against the vices and luxury of the present age they will naturally suppose that I never risked a farthing at the gamingtable never kept a mistress would decline an invitation to a turtlefeast and rather than be provoked to fight a duel would take a kick on the breech or tweak by the nose with all the calmness and resignation imaginable As to my wit and humour I should blush to set down the many com∣pliments I have had from several unknown correspon∣dents on that head and I once received a note from a very honest gentleman who desired to spend an evening with me promising himself great diversion in cracking a bottle with the facetious Mr TOWN  THESE various opinions of me as an Author I shall never labour to reconcile but shall be equally contented with in∣structing or amusing the gentle reader whether he considers my papers as favours showered down upon him from a book∣seller's garret in  Grub Street  or issuing from my own apart∣ment However this may be I shall never think it a disgrace to have written or be ashamed to be considered as an Au∣thor and if ever Mr  Voltaire  should think proper to visit  England  again I shall be very glad of a literary chat with him and will give him a very gracious reception  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXV THURSDAY  April    Caelebs quid agam  HOR  To Mr TOWN  April    SIR  N  O man is a sincerer friend to innocent plea∣santry or more desirous of promoting it than myself Raillery of every kind pro∣vided it be confined within due bounds is in my opinion an excellent ingredient in conversation and I am never displeased if I can contribute to the harmless mirth of the company by being myself the subject of it but in good truth I have neither a fortune a constitution nor a temper that will enable me to chuckle and skake my sides while I suffer more from the festivity of my friends than the spleen or malice of my enemies could possibly inflict upon me nor do I see any reason why  I should so far move the mirthful indignation of the ladies as to be teized and worried to death in mere sport for no earthly reason but that I am what the world calls an Old Bachelor  THE female part of my acquaintance entertain an odd opinion that a Bachelor is not in fact a rational creature at least that he has not the sense of feeling in common with the rest of mankind that a Bachelor may be beat like a stockfish that you may thrust pins into his legs and wring him by the nose in short that you cannot take too many liberties with a Bachelor I am at a loss to conceive on what foundation these romping philosophers have grounded their hypothesis though at the same time I am a melancholy proof of it's existence as well as of it's absurdity  A FRIEND of mine whom I frequently visit has a wife and three daughters the youngest of which has persecuted me these ten years These ingenious young ladies have not only found out the sole end and purpose of my being them∣selves but have likewise communicated their discovery to all the girls in the neighbourhood So that if they happen at any time to be apprized of my coming which I take all possible care to prevent they immediately dispatch half a dozen cards to their faithful allies to beg the favour of their company to drink coffee and  help teaze  Mr  Ironside  Upon these occasions my entry into the room is sometimes obstructed by a cord fastened across the bottom of the door∣case which as I am a little nearsighted I seldom discover till it has brought me upon my knees before them While I am employed in brushing the dust from my black rollers or chasing my broken shins my wig is suddenly conveyed  away and either stuffed behind the lookingglass or tossed from one to the other so dextrously and with such velocity that after many a fruitless attempt to recover it I am obliged to sit down bareheaded to the great diversion of the spec∣tators The last time I found myself in these distressful circumstances the eldest girl a sprightly mischievous jade stepped briskly up to me and promised to restore my wig if I would play her a tune on a small flute she held in her hand I instantly applied it to my lips and blowing lustily into it to my inconceiveable surprise was immediately choked and blinded with a cloud of soot that issued from every hole in the instrument The younger part of the company declared I had not executed the conditions and refused to surrender my wig but the father who had a rough kind of facetiousness about him insisted on it's being delivered up and protested that he never knew the  Black Joke  better performed in his life  I AM naturally a quiet inoffensive animal and not easily ruf∣fled yet I shall never submit to these indignities with patience 'till I am satisfied I deserve them Even the old maids of my acquaintance who one would think might have a fellowfeeling for a brother in distress conspire with their nieces to harrass and torment me And it is not many nights since Miss  Diana Grizzle  utterly spoiled the only superfine suit I have in the world by pinning the skirts of it together with a redhot poker I own my resentment of this injury was so strong that I determined to punish it by kissing the offender which in cool blood I should never have attempted The satisfac∣tion however which I obtained by this imprudent revenge was much like what a man of honour feels on finding him∣self  run through the body by the scoundrel who had offended him My upper lip was transfixed with a large corkin pin which in the scuffle she had conveyed into her mouth and I doubt not that I shall carry the  memorem labris natam  from an old maid to the grave with me  THESE misfortunes or others of the same kind I en∣counter daily but at these seasons of the year which give a sanction to this kind of practical wit and when every man thinks he has a right to entertain himself at his friend's ex∣pence I live in hourly apprehensions of more mortifying adventures No miserable dunghillcock devoted a victim to the wanton cruelty of the mob would be more terrified at the approach of a  ShroveTuesday  were he endued with human reason and forecast than I am at the approach of a merry  Christmas  or the First of  April  No longer ago than last  Thursday  which was the latter of these festivals I was pestered with mortifying presents from the ladies obliged to pay the carriage of half a dozen oysterbarrels stuffed with brickbats and ten pacquets by the post containing nothing but old newspapers But what vexed me the most was the being sent fifty miles out of town on that day by a counter∣feit express from a dying relation  I COULD not help reflecting with a sigh on the resem∣blance between the imaginary grievance of poor  Tom  in the tragedy of  Lear  and those which I really experienced I like him was led through ford and whirlpool o'er bog and quagmire and though knives were not laid under my pil∣low minced horsehair was strewed upon my sheets like him I was made to ride on a hard trotting horse through the most dangerous ways and found at the end of my jour∣ney that I had only been coursing my own shadow  AS much a sufferer as I am by the behaviour of the women in general I must not forget to remark that the pertness and sauciness of an old maid is particularly offen∣sive to me I cannot help thinking that the virginity of these ancient misses is at least as ridiculous as my own celibacy If I am to be condemned for having never made an offer they are as much to blame for having never accepted one If I am to be derided for having never married who never attempted to make a conquest they are more properly the objects of derision who are still unmarried after having made so many Numberless are the proposals they have rejected according to their own account and they are eter∣nally boasting of the havock they have formerly made among the knights baronets and squires at  Bath Tun∣bridge  and  Epsom  while a tattered madrigal perhaps a snip of hair or the portrait of a cherrycheeked gentleman in a milkwhite periwig are the only remaining proofs of those beauties which are now withered like the shortlived rose and have only left the virgin thorn remaining  BELIEVE me Mr TOWN I am almost afraid to trust you with the publication of this epistle the ladies whom I last mentioned will be so exasperated on reading it that I must expect no quarter at their hands for the future since they are generally as little inclined to forgiveness in their old age as they were to pity and compassion in their youth One expedient however is left me and which if put in execution will effectually screen me from their resentment  I SHALL be happy therefore if by your means I may be permitted to inform the ladies that as fusty an animal as they think me it is not impossible but by a little gentler  treatment than I have hitherto met with I may be huma∣nized into a husband As an inducement to them to relieve me from my present uneasy circumstances you may assure them I am rendered so exceeding tractable by the very se∣vere discipline I have undergone that they may mould and fashion me to their minds with ease and consequently that by marrying me a woman will save herself all that trouble which a wife of any spirit is obliged to take with an unruly husband who is absurd enough to expect from her a strict performance of the marriage vow even in the very minute article of obedience that so far from contradicting a lady I shall be mighty well satisfied if she contents herself with contradicting me that if I happen at any time inadvertently to thwart her inclinations I shall think myself rightly served if she boxes my ears spits in my face or treads upon my corns That if I approach her lips when she is not in a kissing humour I shall expect she will bite me by the nose or if I take her by the hand at an improper season that she will instantly begin to pinch scratch and claw and apply her fingers to those purposes which they were certainly in∣tended by nature to fulfil Add to these accomplishments so requisite to make the married state happy that I am not much turned of fifty can tie on my cravat fasten a button or mend a hole in my stocking without any assistance  I am SIR Your very humble Servant CHRISTOPHER IRONSIDE  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXVI THURSDAY  April    Despicere unde queas alios passimque videre  Errare atque viam palantes quaerere vitae  LUCRET  T  HOSE parents who are unable to give their sons an estate regard the educating them to one of the three great professions of Law Physic and Divinity as putting them in the high road to acquire one Hence it happens that nineteen parts out of twenty of our young men are brought up with a view to  Lambeth  the  Seals  or  WarwickLane  But alas their hopes and ex∣pectations of rising by their professions are often frustrated and the surprizing numbers engaged in running the same race necessarily jostle one another For though the courts of justice are tolerably supplied with matters of litigation  though there are many invalids and valetudinarians and though great part of  England  is laid out into church pre∣ferments yet there is not in all the kingdom sufficient matter for legal contention to employ a tenth part of those who have been trained to engross deeds in their chambers or to harangue at the bar the number of patients bears no proportion to the swarms of the Faculty nor would it though a consultation were to sit on every sick man like carrionflies upon a carcase and the prodigious number of reverend Divines infinitely exceeds that of those bishopricks deaneries prebends rectories vicarages c which when they are ordained they conceive it to be part of their holy office to fill From these frequent failures in each of the professions the younger sons of great men often wish they had been permitted to disgrace the family by some mer∣cantile or more plebeian occupation while the son of the mechanic curses the pride of his father who instead of securing him a livelihood in his own business has con∣demned him to starve in puddingsleeves that he might do honour to his relations by being a gentleman  THE Three Professions being thus crouded with more candidates for business and preferment than can possibly be employed or promoted has occasioned several irregula∣rities in the conduct of the followers of each of them The utter impossibility of supporting themselves in the usual method of practising Law Physic or Divinity without clients patients or parishioners has induced the labourers in each of those vocations to seek out new veins and branches The young Solicitor who finds he has nothing to do now he is out of his clerkship offers his assistance in the transaction of all law affairs by the public papers and  like the advertising taylors promises to work cheaper than any of his brethren while the young Barrister after having exhibited his tyewig in  WestminsterHall  during several terms to no purpose is obliged to forego the hope of ri∣valling  Murray  and  Coke  and content himself with being the oracle of the courts of  Jamaica  The graduate in me∣dicine finding himself unsolicited for prescription or advice and likely to starve by practising Physic  secundùm artem  flies in the face of the college and professes to cure all dis∣eases by  nostrums  unmentioned in the dispensatory He com∣mences a thriving quack and soon makes his way through the important medical degrees of walking on foot riding on horseback dispensing his drugs from an onehorsechaise and lastly lolling in a chariot The Divine without living cure or lectureship may perhaps incur transportation for illegal marriages set up a theatricaloratorical  Billingsgate  chapel under the shelter of the tolerationact and the but∣chers of  ClareMarket  or kindle the  inward light  in the bosoms of the Saints of  MoorFields  and the  Magdalens  of  Broad  St  Giles  's  BUT notwithstanding these shoots ingrafted as it were into the main body of the professions it is still impossible for the vast multitude of Divines Lawyers and Physicians to maintain themselves at any rate within the pale of their respective employments They have often been compelled at least to call in adventitious ones and have sometimes to∣tally abandoned their original undertakings They have frequently made mutual transitions into the occupations of each other or have perhaps embraced other employments which though distinct from all three and not usually dig∣nified with the title of Professions may fairly be considered  in that light since they are the sole means of support to many thousands who toiled in vain for a subsistance in the three Capital Ones On these Professions and their various followers I shall here make some observations  THE first of these Professions is an Author The mart of literature is indeed one of the chief resorts of unbeneficed Divines and Lawyers and Physicians without practice There are at present in the world of Authors Doctors of Physic who to use the phrase of one of them have no great fatigue from the business of their profession many Clergymen whose sermons are the most inconsiderable part of their compositions and several Gentlemen of the Inns of Court who instead of driving the quill over skins of parch∣ment lead it through all the mazes of modern novels cri∣tiques and pamphlets Many also have embraced this Pro∣fession who were never bred to any other and I might also mention the many bankrupt tradesmen and broken artificers who daily enter into this new way of business if by persuing it in the same mechanical manner as their former occupati∣ons they might not rather be regarded as following a trade than a Profession  THE second of these Professions is a Player The inge∣nious gentlemen who assume the persons of the Drama are composed of as great a variety of characters as those they represent The history of the stage might afford many in∣stances of those who  in the trade of  death  might have slain men  who have condescended to deal counterfeit slaughter from their right hands and administer harmless phials and bowls of poison We might read also of persons whose fists were intended to beat the  "drum ecclesiastic"  who have  themselves become theatrical voluntiers In regard to the Law many who were originally designed to manifest their talents for elocution in  WestminsterHall  have displayed them in  DruryLane  and it may be added on theatrical authority that  Not even  Attorneys  have this rage withstood  But chang'd their pens for truncheons ink for blood  And strange reversedied for their country's good  I will not so far affront those gentlemen who were at any time engaged in the study of the three honourable profes∣sions of Law Physic and Divinity as to suppose that any of them have ever taken up the more fashionable employment of a Pimp Yet it is certain that this is a very common and lucrative Profession and that very many provide themselves with the necessaries of life by administering to the pleasures of others A convenient cousin sister or wife has some∣times proved the chief means of making a fortune and the tongue of slander has often ventured to affirm that the price of procuration has been paid with a place or a bishoprick  THE most advantageous and genteel of all Professions is Gaming Whoever will make this science his study will find it the readiest way to riches and most certain passport to the best company for the polite world will always admit any one to their society who will condescend to win their money The followers of this Profession are very nume∣rous which is indeed no wonder when we reflect on the numbers it supports in ease and affluence at no greater pains than packing the cards or cogging the dice and no more risk than being sometimes tweaked by the nose or kicked out of company besides which this Profession daily re∣ceives  new lustre from the many persons of quality that follow it and croud into it with as much eagerness as into the army Among Gamesters may also be found Lawyers who get more by being masters of all the Cases in  Hoyle  than by their knowledge of those recorded in the report∣books Physicians the chief object of whose attention is the circulation of the E O table and Divines who we may suppose were hinted at by a famous wit in a certain assembly when among the other benefits resulting from a double tax upon dice he thought fit to enumerate that it might possibly

NUMBER CXVII THURSDAY  April    Ergo haud difficile est perituram arcessere summam  Lancibus oppositis vel matris imagine fractâ  JUV  I  Have often amused myself with consi∣dering the mean and ridiculous shifts to which the extravagant are sometimes re∣duced When the certain supplies of a regular income are exhausted they are obliged to cast about for ready cash and set the invention to work in order to devise the means of repairing their finances Such attempts to enlarge their revenue have frequently driven those whose great souls would not be curbed by the straitness of their circumstances into very uncommon undertakings they have sent lords to  Arthur  's and ladies to assemblies or sometimes worse places We may safely conclude that whoever breaks through all oeconomy will soon discard honesty though perhaps it might be deemed  Scandalum Magnatum  to aver that prodigal men of quality have often sold their  country to redeem their estates and that extravagant ladies have been known to make up the deficiencies of their pinmoney by pilfering and larceny  But one of the first and chief resources of extravagance both in high and low life is the Pawnbroker's I never pass by one of these shops without considering them as the repositories of half the jewels plate  c  in town It is true indeed that the honest and industrious are sometimes forced to supply their necessities by this method but if we were to enquire to whom the several articles in these miscellaneous warehouses belong we should find the greatest part of them to be the pro∣perty of the idle and infamous among the vulgar or the prodigal and luxurious among the great and if in imi∣tation of the antients who placed the Temple of Honour behind the Temple of Virtue propriety should be at∣tempted in the situation of Pawnbrokers' shops they would be placed contiguous to a ginshop as in the in∣genious print of  Hogarth  or behind a tavern gaminghouse or bagnio  Going home late last Saturday night I was witness to a curious dialogue at the door of one of these houses An honest journeyman carpenter whose wife it seems had pawned his best cloaths having just received his week's pay was come to redeem them that he might appear as fine as he usually did on Sunday but it being past twelve o'clock the man of the house who kept up the conversation by means of a little grate in the door re∣fused to deliver them though the poor carpenter begged hard for his holiday cloaths as the morrow was  Easter  Sunday This accident led me to reflect on the various persons in town who carry on this kind of commerce with the Pawnbrokers and gave occasion to the fol∣lowing Dream  I was scarce asleep before I found myself at the entrance of a blind alley which was terminated by a little hatch where I saw a vast concourse of people of different ages sex and condition going in and coming out Some of these I observed as they went up very  richly drest and others were adorned with jewels and costly trinkets but I could not help remarking that at their return they were all divested of their finery and several had even their gowns and coats stript off their backs A lady who strutted up in a rich brocaded suit sneaked back again in an ordinary stuff nightgown a second retreated with the loss of a diamond solitaire and pearl necklace and a third who had bundled up her whole stock of linen scarce escaped with what she had upon her back I observed several gentlemen who brought their sideboards of plate to be melted down as it were into current specie many had their pockets dis∣burthened of their watches and some even among the military gentlemen were obliged to deliver up their swords Others of the company marched up heavy laden with pictures household goods and domestic utensils one carried a spit another brandished a gridiron a third flourished a fryingpan while a fourth brought to my remembrance the old sign of the Dog's Head in the Porridgepot I saw several trot up merrily with their chairs tables and other furniture but I could not help pitying one poor creature among the rest who after having stript his whole house even to his featherbed stalked along like a LockPatient wrapt up in the blankets while his wife accompanied him doing pe∣nance in the sheets  As I was naturally curious to see the inside of the re∣ceptacle where all these various spoils were deposited I stept up to the hatch and meeting a grave old gentleman at the threshold I desired him to inform me what place it was and what business was transacted there He very courteously took me by the hand and leading me through a dark passage brought me into a spacious hall which he told me was the Temple of Usury and that he himself was the chief priest of it One part of this building was hung round with all kinds of apparel like the saleshops in  Monmouth Street  another was strew'd with a variety of goods and resembled the brokers' shops in  Harp Alley  and another part was furnished with such an immense quantity of jewels and rich plate that I should rather have fancied myself in the Church of the  Lady of  Loretto  All these my guide informed me were the offerings of that croud which I had seen re∣sorting to this Temple The Churches in RomanCatholic countries have commonly a cross fixed upon them the  Chinese  erect dragons and hang bells about their Pagods and the  Turkish  Mosques have their peculiar hieroglyphics but I could not help taking particular notice that this Temple of Usury had its vestibule adorned with three wooden balls painted blue the mystery of which I was told was as dark and unfathomable as the  Pythagorean  number or the secret doctrines of  Trismegist  When I had in some measure satisfied my curiosity in taking a general survey of the Temple my instructor led me to an interior corner of it where the most splendid offerings were spread upon a large altar This bauble said he shewing me an elegant sprig of diamonds is an aigret sent in last week by a lady of quality who has ever since kept home with her head muffled up in a double clout for a pretended fit of the toothache She has at different times made an offering of all her jewels and besides these her whole wardrobe was very lately lodged here which threw her into an hysteric fever and con∣fined her to her bedgown for upwards of a month Those earrings and other jewels are the  parapher∣nalia  of a young bride who was so constant a votary to this place that when nothing else remained for an offering she even brought in her weddingring You may be surprised perhaps to behold such a variety of necklaces girdlebuckles solitaires and other female ornaments as are here collected but it is observable that their devotions in the Temple of Usury have been chiefly encouraged and kept alive by their assisting at the midnight orgies of Avarice  Nor are the gentlemen continued he less encouragers of our rites That gold watch laid snug for a consi∣derable time in the fob of a young man of quality but it was one night jerked out by a single throw of the dice at a gamingtable and made its way into the pocket of a stranger who placed it here to keep company with several others which have been brought hither on a  similar occasion Those brilliant buckles once glittered on the shoes of a very pretty fellow who set out last winter on his travels into foreign parts but never got further than  Boulogne  and that sword with the rich fillagree hilt and elegantlyfancied swordknot with gold tassels once dangled at the side of a spirited Buck who left it here two years ago when he went off in a great hurry to take possession of a large estate in his native country  Ireland  whence he is not yet returned You may see many others of these instruments of death which rust peacefully in their scabbards as being of no use whatever to their owners that which commonly hangs upon the vacant peg there belongs you must know to a noble captain it is called upon duty once a month and is at this instant mounting guard at St  James  's  Not far from these rich ornaments hung several em∣broidered coats laced waistcoats  Point d'Espagne  hats  c  This suit said my venerable instructor pointing to one richly embroidered was made up for a noble lord on the last Birthday and was conveyed hither the very next morning after it had appeared at court That jemmy waistcoat with the goldworked buttonholes on the next peg was the property of a smart templar who having spent a night out of his chambers sent his waist∣coat hither in the morning as a penitential offering by his landlady As to that heap of camblet gowns checked aprons and coloured handkerchiefs which you see strung together a little further off they are oblations made here by a sect of maudlin votaries who resort to this Temple to pay their devotions to a Goddess whom they have christened Madam  Gin  but whom they sometimes honour with the more proper appellation of  Strip me Naked  While my conductor was thus relating the history of the various offerings and the persons who had made them he was suddenly called aside to a dark closet se∣veral of which were erected near the entrance and ap∣peared not unlike the confessionals of the  Romish  priests These little boxes I found were appointed to receive the votaries who came to pay their devotions and make their offerings but the necessary rites and ceremonies  were commonly solemnized with as much caution and privacy as the mysteries of the  Bona Dea  among the  Romans  At present however there was a greater noise and hubbub than usual A person of the first rank in the kingdom who had made some very considerable oblations of gold and silver plate was now about to celebrate a feast in honour of  Bacchus  in which these rich utensils would be requisite on which occasion he prayed to have the use of them The chief priest after having received the customary fee granted a dispen∣sation for this purpose and loaded the messengers with a number of wrought ewers vases and chargers at the same time commissioning two or three of the inferior officials of the Temple to attend the celebration of the feast and to take care that the plate was duly returned and safely lodged again in the Temple  These matters were scarce adjusted before an unex∣pected incident filled the whole Temple with confusion and disturbance A rude tribe of officers broke in upon us put a stop to the rites and seized the chief priest himself charging him with having prophaned the place by a crime almost as infamous as sacrilege He was accused of having encouraged robbers to strip the citizens of their most valuable effects and for a small reward to deposit them as offerings The clamour on this occasion was very great and at last one of the officers methought seized me as a party concerned when endeavouring to clear myself and struggling to get out of his clutches I awoke  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXVIII THURSDAY  April    Communi sensu planè caret  HOR  T  HERE is no race of people that has been more conspicuous in almost every relation of life than the illustrious fa∣mily of NONSENSE In every age of the world they have shone forth with uncommon lustre and have made a wonderful progress in all the Arts and Sciences They have at different seasons delivered speeches from the throne harangued at the bar debated in parlia∣ment and gone amazing lengths in philosophical enqui∣ries and metaphysical disquisitions In a word the whole history of the world moral and political is but a  Cyclo∣paedia of  NONSENSE For which reason considering the dignity and importance of the family and the infinite service it has been of to me and many of my cotemporaries  I have resolved to oblige the public with a kind of abstract of the History of NONSENSE  NONSENSE was the daughter of IGNORANCE begot on FALSEHOOD many ages ago in a dark cavern in BOEOTIA As she grew up she inherited all the qualities of her parents she discovered too warm a genius to re∣quire being sent to school but while other dull brats were poring over an hornbook she amused herself with spreading fantastical lies taught her by her mamma and which have in later ages been familiarly known to us under the names of  Sham Banter  and  Humbug  When she grew up she received the addresses and soon became the wife of IMPUDENCE Who he was or of what profession is uncertain Some say he was the son of IGNORANCE by another  venter  and was suffered to become the husband of NONSENSE in those dark ages of the world as the  Ptolemies  of  Aegypt  married their own sisters Some record that he was in the army others that he was an interpreter of the laws and others a divine However this was NONSENSE and IM∣PUDENCE were soon inseparably united to each other and became the founders of a more noble and nume∣rous family than any yet preserved on any tree of descent whatsoever of which ingenious device they were said to have been the first inventors  It is my chief intent at present to record the great exploits of that branch of the family who have made themselves remarkable in  England  though they began to signalize themselves very early and are still very flourishing in most parts of the world Many of them were  Aegyptian  Priests four thousand years ago and told the people that it was religion to wor∣ship dogs monkeys and green leeks and their descen∣dants prevailed on the  Greeks  and  Romans  to build tem∣ples in honour of supposed deities who were in their  own estimation of them whores and whoremongers pickpockets and drunkards Others rose up some ages after in  Turky  and persuaded the people to embrace the doctrine of bloodshed and the sword  in the name of the most merciful God  and others have manifested their lineal descent from NONSENSE and IMPU∣DENCE by affirming that there is no God at all There were also among them many shrewd philosophers some of whom though they were racked with a fit of the stone or laid up with a gouty toe declared that they felt not the least degree of pain and others would not trust their own eyes but when they saw an horse or a dog could not tell whether it was not a chair or a table and even made a doubt of their own existence  We have no certain account of the progress of NON∣SENSE here in  England  till after the Reformation All we hear of her and her progeny before that period of time is that they led a lazy life among the monks in cloysters and convents dreaming over old legends of saints drawing up breviaries and massbooks and string∣ing together some barbarous  Latin  verses in rhyme In the days of Queen  Elizabeth  so little encouragement was given to her family that it seemed to have been almost extinct but in the succeeding reign it flourished again and filled the most considerable offices in the nation NONSENSE became a great favourite at court where she was highly caressed on account of her wit which consisted in puns and quibbles and the bonny monarch himself was thought to take a more than or∣dinary delight in her conversation At this time many of her progeny took orders and got themselves preferred to the best livings by turning the Evangelists into pun∣sters and making St  Paul  quibble from the pulpit Among the rest there was a bishop a favourite son of NONSENSE of whom it is particularly recorded that he used to tickle his courtly audience by telling them that  matrimony  was become a  matter of money  with many other right reverend jests recorded in  Joe Miller  Several bro∣thers of this family were likewise bred to the bar and very gravely harangued against old women sucked by devils in the shape of ramcats  c  As an instance of their profound wisdom and sagacity I need only men∣tion that just and truly pious act of parliament made against the crying sin of witchcraft    Jac  I chap  Such as shall use invocation or conjuration of any evil spirit or shall consult covenant with entertain employ feed or reward any evil spirit to any intent or take up any dead person or part thereof to be used in witchcraft or have used any of the said arts whereby any person shall be killed consumed or lamed in his or her body they together with their ac∣cessories before the fact shall suffer as felons without benefit of clergy  In the troublesome times of King  Charles  the first NONSENSE and her family sided with the Parliament These set up new sects in religion some of them cropt their hair short and called themselves the  enlightened  some fell into trances and pretended to see holy visions while others got into tubs and held forth with many whinings and groans and snuffling through the nose In the merry days of King  Charles  the second NONSENSE assumed a more gay and libertine air and her progeny from fana∣tics became downright infidels Several courtiers of the family wrote lewd plays as well as luscious lovesongs and other loose verses which were collected together and greedily bought up in miscellanies In the succeeding reign some of the kindred who had received their edu∣cation at St  Omers  thought themselves on the point of establishing NONSENSE in church and state and were preparing to make bonfires on the occasion in  Smithfield  when they were obliged to leave the kingdom  Since the Revolution the field of Politics has afforded large scope for NONSENSE and her family to make  themselves remarkable Hence arose the various sects in party distinguished by the names of  Whig  and  Tory Ministerial  and  Jacobite Sunderlandians Oxfordians Go∣dolphinians Bolingbrokians Walpolians Pelhamians c c c  names which have kindled as hot a war in pamphlets and journals as the  Guelphs  and  Gibilines  in  Italy  or the  Big  and  LittleEndians  in the kingdom of  Lilliput  I have here endeavoured to give a short abridgement of the History of NONSENSE though a very small part of the exploits of the family can be included in so com∣pendious a chronicle Some of them were very deep scho∣lars and filled the Professors' Chairs at the Universities They composed many elaborate dissertations to convince the world that two and two make four and discovered by dint of syllogism that white is not black Their enquiries in Natural Philosophy were no less extraordi∣nary many spent their lives and their fortunes in at∣tempting to discover a wonderful Stone that should turn every baser metal into gold and others employed them∣selves in making artificial wings by the help of which they should fly up into the world of the moon Another branch of the family took to the  Belles Lettres  and were the original founders of the learned Society of  GrubStreet  Never was any aera in the annals of NONSENSE more illustrious than the present nor did that noble family ever more signally distinguish itself in every occupation In Oratory who are greater proficients than the progeny of NONSENSE Witness many long and eloquent speeches delivered in St  Stephen  's Chapel in  Westminster  Hall at Assizes and QuarterSessions at  ClareMarket  and the  RobinHood  In Philosophy what marvellous things have not been proved by NONSENSE The sometime Professor of Astronomy at  Gresham  College shewed Sir  Isaac Newton  to be a mere ass and wire∣drawed  the books of  Moses  into a complete system of Natural Philosophy Lifeguardmen have with the ut∣most certainty of NONSENSE foretold Earthquakes and others have penned curious essays on Airquakes Water∣quakes and CometsIn Politics how successfully have the sons of NONSENSE bandied about the terms of Court and Country How wisely have they debated upon Taxes and with what amazing penetration did they but lately foresee an InvasionIn Religion their domain is particularly extensive for though NONSENSE is ex∣cluded at least from the first part of the service in all regular churches yet she often occupies the whole cere∣mony at the Tabernacle and Foundery in  Moorfields  and the Chapel in  LongAcre  But for the credit of so po∣lite an age be it known that the children of NON∣SENSE who are many of them people of fashion are as often seen at the Playhouse as at Church and it is something strange that the family of NONSENSE is now divided against itself and in high contest about the management of their favourite amusementthe OPERA  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXIX THURSDAY  May    Plenus Rimarum sum huc et illuc perfluo  TER  T  HERE is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a friend than the intrusting him with a secret nor any which he is so likely to abuse Confidantes in general are like crazy firelocks which are no sooner charged and cocked than the spring gives way and the report immediately follows Happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one friend they are impatient to manifest their importance to another 'till between them and their friend and their friend's friend the whole matter is presently known to  all our friends round the Wrekin  The secret catches as it were by contact and like electrical matter breaks forth from every link in the chain almost at the  same instant Thus the whole Exchange may be thrown into a buz to morrow by what was whispered in the middle of  Marlborough Downs  this morning and in a week's time the streets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of fashion bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers though at present it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her waitingmaid  AS the talent of secrecy is of so great importance to society and the necessary commerce between individuals cannot be securely carried on without it that this deplorable weakness should be so general is much to be lamented You may as well pour water into a funnel or a sieve and expect it to be retained there as commit any of your concerns to so slippery a companion It is remarkable that in those men who have thus lost the faculty of retention the desire of being communicative is always most prevalent where it is least to be justified If they are intrusted with a matter of no great moment affairs of more consequence will perhaps in a few hours shuffle it entirely out of their thoughts but if any thing be delivered to them with an air of earnestness a low voice and the gesture of a man in terror for the con∣sequence of it's being known if the door is bolted and every precaution taken to prevent a surprise however they may promise secrecy and however they may intend it the weight upon their minds will be so extremely oppressive that it will certainly put their tongues in motion  THIS breach of trust so universal amongst us is perhaps in great measure owing to our education The first lesson our little masters and misses are taught is to become blabs and telltales they are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues  of the family below stairs to pappa and mamma in the parlour and a doll or a hobbyhorse is generally the encou∣ragement of a propensity which could scarcely be attoned for by a whipping As soon as children can lisp out the little intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kit∣chen they are admired for their wit if the butler has been caught kissing the housekeeper in his pantry or the foot∣man detected in romping with the chambermaid away flies little  Tommy  or  Betsy  with the news the parents are lost in admiration of the pretty rogue's understanding and reward such uncommon ingenuity with a kiss and a sugarplumb  NOR does an inclination to secrecy meet with less encou∣ragement at school The governantes at the boardingschool teach miss to be a good girl and tell them every thing she knows thus if any young lady is unfortunately discovered eating a green apple in a corner if she is heard to pronounce a naughty word or is caught picking the letters out of another miss's sampler away runs the chit who is so happy as to get the start of the rest screams out her information as she goes and the prudent matron chucks her under the chin and tells her that she is a good girl and every body will love her  THE management of our young gentlemen is equally absurd In most of our schools if a lad is discovered in a scrape the impeachment of an accomplice as at the  Old Bailey  is made the condition of a pardon I remember a boy engaged in robbing an orchard who was unfortunately taken prisoner in an appletree and conducted under a strong guard of the farmer and his dairymaid to the master's house Upon his absolute refusal to discover his associates  the pedagogue undertook to lash him out of his fidelity but finding it impossible to scourge the secret out of him he at last gave him up for an obstinate villain and sent him to his father who told him he was ruined and was going to dis∣inherit him for not betraying his schoolfellows I must own I am not fond of thus drubbing our youth into treachery and am much more pleased with the request of  Ulysses  when he went to  Troy  who begged of those who were to have the charge of  Telemachus  that they would above all things teach him to be just sincere faithful and to keep a secret  EVERY man's experience must have furnished him with instances of confidantes who are not to be relied on and friends who are not to be trusted but few perhaps have thought it a character so well worth their attention as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may be di∣vided and the different methods by which secrets are communicated  NED TRUSTY is a telltale of a very singular kind Ha∣ving some sense of his duty he hesitates a little at the breach of it If he engages never to utter a syllable he most punctually performs his promise but then he has the knack of insinuating by a nod and a shrug welltimed or a sea∣sonable leer as much as others can convey in express terms It is difficult in short to determine whether he is more to be admired for his resolution in not mentioning or his in∣genuity in disclosing a secret He is also excellent at a  "doubtful phrase"  as Hamlet calls it or an  "ambiguous giving out"  and his conversation consists chiefly of such broken innuendos  As well I knowor I couldan if I would  Or if I list to speakor there be an if there might c  Here he generally stops and leaves it to his hearers to draw proper inferences from these piecemeal premises With due encouragement however he may be prevailed on to slip the padlock from his lips and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of secret history which rushes forth with more violence for having been so long confined  POOR MEANWELL though he never fails to transgress is rather to be pitied than condemned To trust him with a secret is to spoil his appetite to break his rest and to deprive him for a time of every earthly enjoyment Like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his pocket he is terrified if you approach him and immediately suspects that you come with a felonious intent to rob him of his charge If he ventures abroad it is to walk in some unfre∣quented place where he is least in danger of an attack At home he shuts himself up from his family paces it to and fro' in his chamber and has no relief but from muttering over to himself what he longs to publish to the world and would gladly submit to the office of town cryer for the li∣berty of proclaiming it in the market place At length however weary of his burthen and resolved to bear it no longer he consigns it to the custody of the first friend he meets and returns to his wife with a cheerful aspect and wonderfully altered for the better  CARELESS is perhaps equally undesigning though not equally excusable Intrust him with an affair of the utmost importance on the concealment of which your fortune and happiness depend he hears you with a kind of halfatten∣tion  whistles a favourite air and accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table As soon as your narration is ended or perhaps in the middle of it he asks your opinion of his swordknot damns his taylor for having dressed him in a snuffcolour'd coat instead of a  pompadour  and leaves you in haste to attend an auction where as if he meant to dispose of his intelligence to the best bidder he divulges it with a voice as loud as the auctioneer's and when you tax him with having played you false he is hear∣tily sorry for it but never knew that it was to be a secret  TO these I might add the character of the open and un∣reserved who thinks it a breach of friendship to conceal any thing from his intimates and the impertinent who ha∣ving by dint of observation made himself master of your secret imagines he may lawfully publish the knowledge it has cost him so much labour to obtain and considers that privilege as the reward due to his industry But I shall leave these with many other characters which my reader's own experience may suggest to him and conclude with pre∣scribing as a short remedy for this evilThat no man may betray the counsel of his friend let every man keep his own  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXX THURSDAY  May    Judicium subtile videndis artibus  HOR  T  ASTE is at present the darling idol of the polite world and the world of letters and indeed seems to be considered as the quin∣tessence of almost all the arts and sciences The fine ladies and gentlemen dress with Taste the architects whether  Gothic  or  Chinese  build with Taste the painters paint with Taste the poets write with Taste critics read with Taste and in short fidlers players singers dancers and mechanics themselves are all the sons and daughters of Taste Yet in this amazing super∣abundancy of Taste few can say what it really is or what the word itself signifies Should I attempt to define it in the stile of a  Connoisseur  I must run over the names of all the famous poets painters and sculptors ancient and mo∣dern  and after having pompously harangued on the excel∣lencies of  Apelles Phidias Praxiteles Angela Rubens Poussin  and  Dominichino  with a word or two on all  taste∣ful  compositions such as those of  Homer Virgil Tasso Dante  and  Ariosto  I should leave the reader in wonder of my profound erudition and as little informed as before But as deep learning though more flaming and pompous is perhaps not always so useful as common sense I shall endeavour to get at the true meaning of the word Taste by considering what it usually imports in familiar writings and ordinary conversation  IT is supposed by  Locke  and other close reasoners that words are intended as signs of our ideas but daily expe∣rience will convince us that words are often used to express no ideas at all Thus many persons who talk perpetually of Taste throw it out as a mere expletive without any meaning annexed to it  Bardolph  when demanded the meaning of the word  accommodated  wisely explains it by say∣ing that  "  accommodated  sir isaaa  accommodated  sir is as if one should saya  accommodated  "  and if in like manner you ask one of these people  What is Taste  they will tell you that "Taste is a kind of a sort of aaa in short  "Taste is Taste"  These talkers must be con∣sidered as absolute blanks in conversation since it is im∣possible to learn the explanation of a term from them as they affix no determinate meaning to any expression  AMONG men of sense whose words carry meaning in their sound Taste is commonly used in one of these two significations First when they give any person the ap∣pellation of a Man of Taste they would intimate that he  has a turn for the polite arts as well as the lesser elegancies of life and that from his natural bent to those studies and his acquired knowledge in them he is capable of distin∣guishing what is good or bad in any thing of that kind submitted to his judgment The meaning at other times implied by a Man of Taste is that he is not only so far an adept in those matters as to be able to judge of them ac∣curately but is also possessed of the faculty of executing them gracefully These two significations will perhaps be more easily conceived and clearly illustrated when applied to our Sensual Taste The Man of Taste according to the first may be considered as a  Bon Vivant  who is fond of the dishes before him and distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious or flat and insipid in the ingredients of each according to the second he may be regarded as the Cook who from knowing what things will mix well together and distinguishing by a nice taste when he has arrived at that happy mixture is able to compose such exquisite dishes  BOTH these significations of the word will be found agree∣able to the following definition of it which I have some∣where seen and is the only just description of the term that I ever remember to have met with  "Taste consists in a nice harmony between the Fancy and the Judgment"  The most chastised judgment without genius can never constitute a Man of Taste and the most luxuriant Imagina∣tion unregulated by Judgment will only carry us into wild and extravagant deviations from it To mix oil vinegar butter milk eggs c incoherently together would make an Olio not to be relished by any palate and the man who has no goût for delicacies himself will never compose a good  dish though he should ever so strictly adhere to the rules of  La Chapelle Hannah Glasse  and  Martha Bradley  I con∣fine myself at present chiefly to that signification of the word which implies the capacity of exerting our own facul∣ties in the several branches of Taste because That always includes the other  HAVING thus settled what Taste is it may not be unen∣tertaining to examine modern Taste by these rules and perhaps it will appear that on the one hand its most pleasing flights and ravishing elegancies are extravagant and absurd and that on the other hand those who affect a correct Taste in all their undertakings proceed mechanically without ge∣nius The first species of Taste which gives a loose to the imagination indulges itself in caprice and is perpetually striking new strokes is the chief regulator of the fashion In dress it has put huntingpoles into the hands of our gentlemen and erected coaches and windmills on the heads of our ladies In equipage it has built chariots of  papier maché  and by putting spotted  Danish  horses into the harness has made our beaux look like  Bacchus  in his car drawn by leopards The ornaments both on the outside and inside of our houses are all  Gothic  or  Chinese  and whoever makes a pagod of his parlour throws a plank or two with an irre∣gular crossbarred paling over a dirty ditch or places battle∣ments on a roothouse or a stable fits up his house and garden entirely in Taste  THE second sort of Men of Taste are to be found chiefly among the Literati and are those who despising the mo∣dern whims to which fashion has given the name of Taste pretend to follow with the most scrupulous exactness the  chaste models of the antients These are the poets who favour us with correct epithetical and  tasteful  compositions whose works are without blemish and conformable to the precise rules of  Quintilian Horace  and  Aristotle  and as they are intended merely for the perusal of persons of the most refined Taste it is no wonder that they are above the level of common understandings These too are the Critics who in their comments upon authors embarrass us with repeated allusions to the study of  Virtù  And these too are the Connoisseurs in Architecture who build ruins after  Vi∣truvius  and necessaries according to  Palladio  One gentle∣man of this cast has built his villa upon a bleak hill with four spacious porticos open on each side to court the four winds because in the sultry regions of  Italy  this model has been thought most convenient and another has in great measure shut out the light from his apartments and cut off all prospect from his windows by erecting an high wall be∣fore his house which in  Italy  has been judged necessary to screen them from the sun  ARCHITECTURE seems indeed to be the main article in which the efforts of Taste are now displayed Among those who are fond of exerting their fancies in capricious innova∣tions I might instance the many pretty whims of which an infinite variety may be seen within ten miles of  London  But us a proof of the noble and judicious Taste among us I shall beg leave to describe in the stile of a Connoisseur a most amazing curiosity erected in a very polite quarter of this town  IN the midst of a noble and spacious area stands a grand Obelisk The Base forms a perfect square with right  angles the Body of it is cylindrical but the Capital is an Heptagon and has several curious lines and figures described on each of its seven

CXXI THURSDAY  May    Placet impares  Formas atque animos sub juga ahenea  Saevo mittere cum joco  HOR  T  HOUGH I shall not as yet vouchsafe to let the reader so far into my secrets as to inform him whether I am married or single it may not be amiss to ac∣quaint him that supposing I still remain a batchelor it has not been the fault of my friends or relations On the contrary as soon as I was what they call settled in the world they were so assiduous in looking out for a wife for me that nothing  was required on my part but immediately to fall in love with the lady they had pitched upon and could I have complied with their several choices I should have been married at the same time to a tall and a short a plump and a slender a young and an old woman one with a great deal of money and another with none at all each of whom were separately recommended by them as the properest person in the world for me  I know not how it happens but it is notorious that most people take a pleasure in making matches either thinking matrimony a state of bliss into which they would charitably call all their friends and acquaintance or perhaps struggling in the toils they are desirous of catching others in the net that ensnared them Many matches have been brought about between two persons absolute strangers to each other through this kind mediation of our friends who are always ready to take upon them the office of an honourable gobetween Some have come together merely from having been talked of by their acquaintance as likely to make a match and I have known a couple who have met by accident at an horserace or danced together at an assembly that in less than a fortnight have been driven into matrimony in their own defence by having been first paired in private conversations and afterwards in the common newspapers  As we cannot insure happiness to our friends at the same time that we help them to husbands or wives one would imagine that few would care to run the ha∣zard  of bestowing misery where they meant a kindness I know a goodnatured lady who has officiously brought upon herself the illwill and the curses of many of her dearest and most intimate friends on this very account She has a sister for whom she provided a most excellent husband who has shewn his affection for her by spend∣ing her whole fortune upon his mistresses she con∣trived that another near relation should snap up a rich widow who was arrested for her debts within a week after marriage and it cost her a whole twelvemonth to bring two doating lovers of her acquaintance together who parted beds before the honeymoon was expired  But if our friends will thus condescend to be Matchmakers from a spirit of benevolence and for our own ad∣vantage only there are others who have taken up the pro∣fession from less disinterested motives who bring beauty and fortune to market and traffick in all the accomplish∣ments that can make the marriage state happy These traders dispose of all sorts of rich heirs and heiresses ba∣ronets lords ladies of fashion and daughters of country squires with as much coolness as drovers sell bullocks They keep complete registers of the condition and quali∣fications of all the marriageable persons within the king∣dom and it is as common to apply to them for an husband or wife as to the registeroffices for a man or maidservant They may indeed be considered as fa∣thers and guardians for the greatest part of our youth of both sexes since in marriage they may be most properly said to give them away  It is something comical to consider the various persons to whom men of this profession are useful We may naturally suppose that a young fellow who has no estate but what like  Tinsel  's in the  Drummer  is merely  personal  would be glad to come down handsomely after consummation with a woman of fortune and a smart girl who has more charms than wealth would give round poundage on being taken for better for worse by a rich heir Many a tradesman also wants a wife to manage his family while he looks after the shop and thinks it better to recommend himself by this convenient friend than by means of the  Daily Advertiser  There are also several young people who are indifferent as to any person in particular and have no passion for the state itself yet want to be married because it will deliver them from the restraint of parents But the most unnatural though very common applications of this sort are from the rich and the noble who having immense estates to bestow on their children will make use of the meanest instruments to couple them to another of the same over∣grown fortune  I have known many droll accidents happen from the mistakes of these mercenary Matchmakers and remem∣ber one in particular which I shall here set down for the entertainment of my readers A careful old gen∣tleman came up from the North on purpose to marry his son and was recommended by one of these couplers to a twenty thousand pounder He accordingly put on his best wig best beaver and goldbuttoned coat and went to pay his respects to the lady's mamma He told her  that he had not the pleasure of being known to her but as his son's quiet depended on it he had taken the liberty of waiting on her in short he at length broke the matter to her and informed her that his boy had seen her daughter at church and was violently in love with her concluding that he would do very hand∣somely for the lad and would make it worth her while to have him The old lady thanked him for the ho∣nour he intended her family but she supposed to be sure as he appeared to be a prudent and sensible gentle∣tleman he would expect a fortune answerable  "Say nothing of that madam say nothing of that"  inter∣rupted the Don  "I have heardbut if it was less it should not break any squares between us"  "Pray sir how much does the world say"  replied the lady  "Why madam I suppose she has not less than twenty thousand pounds"  "  Not so much sir  "  said the old lady very gravely  "Well madam I suppose then it may be nineteen ororonly eighteen thousand pounds"  "  Not so much sir  "  "Well well per∣haps not butif it was only seventeen thousand"  "No sir"  "Or sixteen"  "No"  "Or we must make allowances perhaps but fifteen thousand"  "  Not so much sir  "  Here ensued a profound silence for near a minute when the old gentleman rubbing his forehead  "Well madam we must come to some con∣clusionPray is it less than fourteen thousand How much more is it than twelve thousand"  "Less sir"  "  Less madam  "  "Less"  "But is it more than ten thousand"  "  Not so much sir  "  "Not so much madam"  "  Not so much  "  "Why  if it is lodged in the funds consider madam interest is low very lowbut as the boy loves her trifles shall not part us Has she got eight thousand Pounds"  "  Not so much sir  "  "Why then madam perhaps the young lady's fortune may not be above sixor five thousand pounds"  "NOTHING LIKE IT SIR"  At these words the old gentleman started from his chair and running out of the room  "Your servant your servantmy son is a fool and the fellow who recommended me to you is a blockhead and knows nothing of business"  Just is

CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXXII THURSDAY  May    Nullâ virtute redemptum  A vitiis  HOR  I  MENTIONED in a former paper that a friend of mine was writing  A New Treatise on Ethics  or  A System of Immoral Philosophy  compiled from the principles and practice of the present age in which the extraordinary modesty of the Mo∣derns would be enlarged on which has induced them to comprehend all the vices instead of virtues in their idea of a Fine Gentleman The work is now finished and the Author has sent me the following letter concerning the Dedication with leave to submit it to the public  DEAR TOWN  THE flatness and fulsom insipidity of Dedications has often been the subject of our conversation and we have always agreed that Authors have miscarried in these pieces of flattery by injudiciously affronting when they meant to compliment their patrons The humble Dedicator loads his Great Man with virtues totally foreign to his nature and disposition which sit as aukwardly upon him as lace or embroidery on a chimneysweeper and so overwhelms him with the huge mass of learning with which he graciously dubs him a scholar that he makes as ridiculous a figure as the Ass in the  Dunciad  After having thus bepraised his patron till the new  Maecenas  is heartily ashamed of himself he wonders that no notice is taken of so pompous an eulogium and that a Dedi∣cation should be as mere a drug as a sermon  Lory  in the  Relapse  advises  Fashion  to get into the good graces of Lord  Foppington  by falling in love with his coat being in raptures with his peruke ravished with the gen∣teel dangle of his swordknot and in short to recom∣mend himself to his noble elder brother by seeming to be captivated with his favourites In like manner the au∣thor who would make his Dedication really valuable should not talk to his patron of his honour and virtue and integrity and a pack of unfashionable qualities which only serve to disgrace a Fine Gentleman but boldly paint him what he really is and at the same time convince him of his merit in being a fool and his glory in being a scoundrel This mode of Dedication though proper at all times will appear with a particular good grace before a  System of Immoral Philosophy  where∣fore  as my book is now finished I have here sent you a rough draught of the Epistle Dedicatory and shall be glad to hear your opinion of it  May it please your Grace  or  My Lord  or  Sir  YOU are in every point so complete a Fine Gentle∣man that the following treatise is but a faint transcript of your accomplishments There is not one qualification requisite in the character of a man of spirit which you do not possess Give me leave therefore on the present occasion to point forth your inestimable qualities to the world and hold up to the public view so glorious an example  YOU distinguished yourself so early in life and exalted yourself so far above the common pitch of vulgar Bucks that you was distinguished before the age of twenty with the noble appellation of STAG And when I con∣sider the many gallant exploits you have performed the number of rascally poltroons you have sent out of the world the number of pretty little foundlings you have brought into it how many girls you have debauched how many women of quality you have intrigued with and how many hogsheads of  French  wine have run through your body I cannot help contemplating you as a STAG of the first head  WHAT great reason have you to value yourself on your noble Atchievements at  Arthur  's the sums you formerly lost and those you have lately won are amazing instances of your spirit and address first in venturing so deeply before you was let into the secret and then in manag∣ing it with so much adroitness and dexterity since you  have been acquainted with it Nobody cogs the dice or packs the cards half so skilfully you hedge a bet with uncommon nicety and are a most incomparably shrewd judge of the odds  NOR have your exploits on the Turf rendered you less famous Let the annals of  Pond  and  Heber  deliver down to posterity the glorious account of what plates you have won what matches you made and how often the Knowing Ones have been taken in when for private reasons you have found it necessary that your horse should run on the wrong side of the post or be di∣stanced after winning the first heat I need not mention your own skill in Horsemanship and in how many matches you have condescended to ride yourself for in this particular it must be acknowledged that you cannot be outdone even by your groom or jockey  ALL the world will witness the many instances of your Courage which has been often tried and exerted in  HydePark  and behind  MontagueHouse  nay you have sometimes been known to draw your sword most heroicly at the opera the play and even at private routes and assemblies How often have you put to flight a whole army of watchmen constables and beadles with the justices at their head You have cleared a whole bawdyhouse before you and taken many a tavern by storm you have pinned a waiter to the ground and have besides proved yourself an ex∣cellent marksman by shooting a postboy flying With so much valour and firmness it is not to be doubted but that you would behave with the same intrepidity if occasions called upon  HounslowHeath  or in  MaidenheadThicket  and if it were necessary you would as boldly resign yourself up to the hands of  Jack Ketch  and swing as genteely as  Maclean  or  Gentleman Harry  The same noble spirit would likewise enable you to aim the pistol at your own head and go out of the world like a man of honour and a gentleman  BUT your Courage has not rendered you insusceptible of the softer passions for which your heart has been ever inclined To say nothing of your gallantries with women of fashion your intrigues with milliners and mantuamakers or your seducing of raw country girls and innocent tradesmens daughters you have formerly been so constant in your devoirs to Mrs  Douglass  and the whole sisterhood that you sacrificed your health and constitution in their service But above all witness that sweet delicate creature whom you have now in keeping and for whom you entertain such a strong and faithful passion that for her sake you have tenderly and affectionately deserted your wife and family  THOUGH from your elegant taste for pleasures you appear made for the gay world yet these polite Amuse∣ments have not called off your attention from the more serious studies of Politics and Religion In Politics you have made such a wonderful proficiency both in theory and practice that you have discovered the good of your country to be a mere joke and confirmed your own interest as well as established your conse∣quence in the proper place by securing half a dozen Boroughs As to Religion you soon unravelled every mystery of that and not only know the Bible to be as romantic as the Alcoran but have also written several  volumes to make your discoveries plain to meaner capa∣cities The ridiculous prejudices of a foolish world un∣happily prevent your publishing them at present but you have wisely provided that they shall one day see the light when I doubt not they will be deemed invaluable and be as universally admired as the posthumous works of Lord  Bolingbroke  I am May it please your Grace  or  My Lord  or  Sir in humble admiration of your excellencies  c c

reception of all infants in general under a certain age have I find given uni∣versal satisfaction The consequences of a big belly do not appear so dreadful as heretofore and it was but yesterday that a young fellow of intrigue told me he was happy that his children would no longer be thrown out of the Hospital as he himself was out of  Arthur  's by black balls For my part though I have no lady in keeping no child by my housekeeper nor any other affair of gallantry on my  hands which makes me wish to swell the number of infants maintained by that charity I must own myself to be exceedingly rejoiced at the extension of so benevo∣lent a design I look upon it as the certain preservation of many hundreds in embryo nor shall we now hear of so many helpless babes birthstrangled in a necessary or smothered by the ditchdelivered drab As a bastard is accounted in law  quasi nullius filius  the child of no∣body and related to nobody and yet is blest with as fair proportions and capable of an equal degree of per∣fection with  "honest madam's issue"  it is surely an act of great humanity thus to rescue them from untimely deaths and other miseries which They do not merit whatever may be the guilt of their parents  THOUGH it is obvious that this Hospital will be made the receptacle of many legitimate children it is no less certain that the rich as well as the poor will often send their baseborn bantlings to this general nursery The wealthy man of quality or substantial cit may have their private familyreasons for not owning the fruits of their secret amours and be glad to put the little living witness of their intrigues out of the way For this reason an history of the Foundlings received there would be very curious and entertaining as it would contain many anec∣dotes not to be learned from any Parish Register The reflections that passed in my mind on this subject gave occasion the other evening to the following Dream  Methought as I was standing at the private door of the Hospital where a croud of females each of them with a child in her arms were pressing to get in an elderly gentleman whom from his white staff I took to  be a governour of the charity very courteously invited me to come in I accepted his offer and having seated myself next him  "Mr TOWN says he I am con∣scious that you look upon most these little infants as the offsprings of so many unmarried fathers and maidenmothers which have been clandestinely smuggled into the world Know then that I am one of those guar∣dian Genii appointed to superintend the fortunes of Bastards therefore as this Hospital is more immedi∣ately under my tuition I have put on this disguise and if you please will let you into the secret history of those babes who are my wards and their parents"  I assured him his intelligence would be highly agree∣able and several now coming up to offer their children he resumed his discourse  "Observe said he that jolly little rogue with plump cheeks a florid com∣plexion blue eyes and sandy locks We have here already several of his brethren by the mother's side some fair some brown and some black and yet they are all supposed to have come by the same father The mother has for many years been housekeeper to a gentleman who cannot see that her children bear the marks of his own servants and that this very brat is the exact resemblance of his coachman  "THAT puling whining infant there with a pale face emaciated body and distorted limbs is the forced pro∣duct of viperbroth and cantharides It is the offspring of a wornout buck of quality who at the same time he debauched the mother ruined her constitution by a filthy disease in consequence of which she with much  difficulty brought forth this just picture of himself in miniature  "THE next that offers is the issue of a careful cit who as he keeps an horse for his own riding on sundays which he lets out all the rest of the week keeps also a mistress for his recreation on the seventh day who lets herself out on all the other six That other babe owes his birth likewise to the city but is the joint product as we may say of two fathers who being great oeconomists in their pleasures as well as in their business have set up a whore and an one horsechaise in partnership together  "THAT pert young baggage there who so boldly presses forward with her brat is not the mother of it but is maid to a single lady of the strictest honour and unblemished reputation About a twelve month ago her mistress went to  Bath  for the benefit of her health and ten months after she travelled into  North Wales  to see a relation from whence she is just returned We may suppose that she took a fancy to that pretty babe while in the country and brought it up to town with her in order to place it here as she did a few years ago to another charming boy which being too old to be got into this Hospital is now at a school in  Yorkshire  where young gentlemen are boarded cloath∣ed and educated and found in all necessaries for ten pounds a year  "THAT chubby little boy which you see in the arms of yonder strapping wench in a camblet gown and red cloak is her own son She is by profession a bedmaker  in one of the universities and of the same college in which the father a grave tutor holds a fellowship under the usual condition of not marrying Many sober gentlemen of the cloth who are in the same scrape are glad to take the benefit of this charity And if all of the same reverend order like the priests abroad were laid under the same restrictions you might expect to see a particular Hospital erected for the reception of the Sons of the Clergy  "THAT next child belongs to a seacaptain's lady whose husband is expected to return every moment from a long voyage the fears of which have happily hastened the birth of this infant a full month before its time That other is the posthumous child of a wealthy old gentleman who had married a young girl for love and dyed in the honeymoon This his son and heir was not born till near a twelve month after his decease because its birth was retarded by the ex∣cessive grief of his widow who on that account ra∣ther chose to lyein privately and to lodge their only child here than to have its legitimacy and her own honour called in question by her husband's relations"  MY companion pointed out to me several others no less extraordinary among which I remember he told me one was the unhallowed brood of a Methodist teacher and another the premature spawn of a Maid of honour A poor author eased himself of a very heavy load of two twindaughters which in an evil hour he begot on an hawker of pamphlets after he had been writing a luscious novel but I could not help smiling at the marks sent in with these new Muses signifying that one had been  christened  Terpsichore  and the other  Polyhymnia  Several bantlings were imported from  Islington Hoxton  and other villages within the sound of  Bow Bell  many were transplanted hither out of the country and a whole litter of brats were sent in from two or three parishes in particular for which it is doubtful whether they were most indebted to the parson or the squire  A modestlooking woman now brought a very fine babe to be admitted but the governors rejected it as it appeared to be above two months old The mother on the contrary persisted in affirming that it was but just born and addressing herself to me desired me to look at it I accordingly took it in my arms and while I was tossing it up and down and praising its beauty the sly hussy contrived to slip away leaving the precious charge to my care The efforts which I made to bawl after her and the squalling of the brat which rung pite∣ously in my ears luckily awaked me and I was very happy to find that I had only been dandling my pillow instead of a bantling  Just Published  In Two Neat Pocket Volumes Price Six Shillings bound  The CONNOISSEUR revised and corrected  With a new Translation of the  Mottos  and

sine crimine mores  Nudaque simplicitas purpureusque pudor  Non mihi mille placent non sum desultor amoris  Tu mihi si qua fides cura perennis eris  OVID  A  LMOST every man is or has been or at least thinks that he is or has been a Lover One has fought for his mistress another has drank for her another wrote for her and another has done all three and yet perhaps in spite of their duels poetry and bumpers not one of them ever entertained a sincere passion I have lately taken a survey of the numerous tribe of  Enamoratos  and after having observed the various shapes they wear think I  may safely pronounce that though all profess to have been in Love there are very few who are really capable of it  IT is a maxim of  Rochefoucault  's that  "many men would never have been in Love if they had never heard of Love"  The justice of this remark is equal to its shrewdness The ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence on young minds who learn to Love as they do every thing else by imitation Young crea∣tures almost mere children have been consumed with this secondhand flame lighted up at another's passion and in consequence of the loves of the footman and chambermaid I have known little master fancy himself a dying swain at the age of thirteen and little miss pining away with Love in a bib and hanging sleeves  THAT vast heap of volumes filled with Love and suffi∣cient in number to make a library are great inflamers and seldom fail to produce that kind of passion described by  Rochefoucault  The chief of these literary seducers are the old romances and their degenerate spawn the modern no∣vels The young student reads of the emotions of Love till he imagines that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little breast as valetudinarians study the history of a disease till they fancy themselves affected with every symp∣tom of it For this reason I am always sorry to see any of this trash in the hands of young people I look upon  Cassandra  and  Cleopatra  as well as  Betty Barnes Polly Willis  c as no better than bawds and consider Don  Bellianis  of  Greece  and Sir  Amadis de Gaul  with  George Edwards Loveill  c as arrant pimps But though romances and novels are both equally stimulatives yet their operations are very different  The romancestudent becomes a fond  Corydon  of  Sicily  or a very  Damon  of  Arcadia  and is in good truth such a dying swain that he believes he shall hang himself on the next willow or drown himself in the next pond if he should lose the object of his wishes but the young novelist turns out more a man of the world and after having gained the affections of his mistress forms a hundred schemes to secure the possession of her and to bam her relations  THERE are among the tribe of Lovers a sort of luke∣warm gentlemen who can hardly be said in the language of Love to entertain a  flame  for their mistress These are your men of superlative delicacy and refinement who loath the gross ideas annexed to the amours of the vulgar and aim at something more spiritualized and sublime These philosophers in Love doat on the mind alone of their mistress and would fain see her naked soul diverted of its material incumbrances Gentlemen of this complexion might per∣haps not improperly be ranged in the romantic class but they have assumed to themselves the name of  Platonic Lovers  PLATONISM however is in these days very scarce and there is another class infinitely more numerous composed of a sort of Lovers whom we may justly distinguish by the title of  Epicureans  The principles of this sect are diametri∣cally opposite to those of the  Platonics  They think no more of the soul of their mistress than a mussulman but are in raptures with her person A Lover of this sort is in perpetual extasies his passion is so violent that he even scorches you with his flame and he runs over the perfec∣tions of his mistress in the same stile that a jockey praises his  horse  "Such limbs such eyes such a neck and breast suchoh she's a rare piece"  Their ideas go no farther than mere external accomplishments and as their wounds may be said to be only skin deep we cannot allow their breasts to be smitten with Love though perhaps they may rankle with a much grosser passion Yet it must be owned that nothing is more common than for gentlemen of this cast to be involved in what is called a Lovematch but then it is owing to the same cause with the marriage of Sir  John Brute  who says  "I married my wife because I wanted to lie with her and she would not let me"  OTHER gentlemen of a gay disposition and warm consti∣tution who go in the catalogue for Lovers are adorers of almost every woman they see The flame of Love is as easily kindled in them as the sparks are struck out of a flint and it also expires as soon A Lover of this sort dances one day with a lady at a ball and loses his heart to her in a minuet the next another carries it off in the mall and the next day perhaps he goes out of town and lodges it in the possession of all the country beauties successively till at last he brings it back to town with him and presents it to the first woman he meets This class is very numerous but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe of true Lovers since a gentleman who is thus in Love with every body may fairly be said not to be in Love at all  LOVE is universally allowed to be whimsical and if whim is the essence of Love none can be accounted truer Lovers than those who admire their mistress for some particular charm which enchains them though it would singly never captivate any body else Some gentlemen have been won  to conjugal embraces by a pair of fine arms others have been held fast by an even white set of teeth and I know a very good scholar who was ensnared by a set of golden tresses because it was the taste of the antients and the true classical hair Those ladies whose lovers are such piecemeal admirers are in perpetual danger of losing them A rash or a pimple may abate their affection All those the object of whose adoration is merely a pretty face or a fine person are in the power of the like accidents and the small pox has occasioned many a poor lady the loss of her beauty and her Lover at the same time  BUT after all these spurious  Enamoratos  there are some few whose passion is sincere and wellfounded True ge∣nuine Love is always built upon esteem not that I would mean that a man can reason and argue himself into Love but that a constant intercourse with an amiable woman will lead him into a contemplation of her excellent qualities which will insensibly win his heart before he is himself aware of it and beget all those hopes fears and other extrava∣gances which are the natural attendants on a true passion Love has been described ten thousand times but that I may be sure that the little picture I would draw of it is taken from nature I will conclude this paper with the story of honest WILL EASY and his amiable wife WILL EASY and Miss became very early acquainted and from being familiarly intimate with the whole family WILL might be almost said to live there He dined and supped with them perpetually in town and spent great part of the summer with them at their seat in the country WILL and the lady were both universally allowed to have sense and their fre∣quent conversations together gave them undoubted proofs of  the goodness of each other's disposition They delighted in the company and admired the perfections of each other and gave a thousand little indications of a growing passion not unobserved by others even while it was yet unknown and unsuspected even by themselves However after some time WILL by mutual agreement demanded the lady of her father in marriage But alas  "the course of true Love never yet run smooth"  the illjudged ambition of a parent induced the father out of mere love to his daugh∣ter to refuse her hand to the only man in the world with whom she could live happily because he imagined that he might in the  Smithfield  phrase do  better  for her But Love grounded on just principles is not easily shaken and as it appeared that their mutual passion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated the father at last reluctantly halfconsented to their union They enjoy a genteel competency and WILL by his integrity and abilities is an honour to a learned profession and a blessing to his wife whose greatest praise is that her virtues deserve such an husband She is pleased with having  "left dross to duchesses"  He considers her happiness as his main in∣terest and their example every day gives fresh conviction to the father that where two persons of strong sense and good hearts conceive a reciprocal affection for each other their passion is genuine and lasting and their union is perhaps the truest state of happiness under the sun  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXXV THURSDAY  June    Hae sane vires amicitiae mortis contemptum

correspondents in that learned University The Ode to Friendship has in my opinion many beauties and is infinitely superior  to the meagre productions of some celebrated Ode∣mongers The Fable I have

ordinary discouragement at this place yet  Cambridge  has produced many celebrated poets witness  Spenser Milton Cowley Dryden  c not to men∣tion some admired writers of the present times I my∣self Sir am grievously suspected of being better ac∣quainted with  Homer  and  Virgil  than  Euclid  or  Sander∣son  and am universally agreed to be  ruined  for having concerned myself with Hexameter and Pentameter more than Diameter The equity of this decision I shall not  dispute but content myself at present with submitting to the publick by means of your paper the following lines on the import of another favourite word occasioned by the essay above mentioned  WORDS are so  Wollaston  defines  Of our ideas merely signs  Which have a pow'r at will to vary  As being vague and arbitrary  Now  damn'd  for instanceAll agree  Damn'd  's the  superlative Degree    Means  that  alone and nothing more  However taken heretofore  Damn'd  is a word can't stand alone  Which has no meaning of its own  But signifies or bad or good  Just as its neighbour's understood  Examples we may find enough  Damn'd  high  damn'd  low  damn'd  fire  damn'd  stuff  So fares it too with its relation  I mean its substantive  damnation  The wit with metaphors makes bold  And tells you he's  damnation  cold  Perhaps that metaphor forgot  The selfsame wit's  damnation  hot  AND here a fable I remember  Once in the middle of  December  When ev'ry mead in snow was lost  And ev'ry river bound with frost  When families got all together  And feelingly talk o'er the weather  Whenpox of the descriptive rhime  In short it was the winter time  It was a pedlar's happy lot  To fall into a  Satyr  's cot  Shiv'ring with cold and almost froze  With pearly drop upon his nose  His fingers ends all pinch'd to death  He blew upon them with his breath  Friend quoth the  Satyr  what intends  That blowing on thy fingers ends  "It is to warm them thus I blow  "For they are froze as cold as snow  "And so inclement has it been  "I'm like a cake of ice within"  Come quoth the  Satyr  comfort then  I'll chear thy inside if I can  You're welcome in my homely cottage  To a warm fire and mess of pottage  THIS said the  Satyr  nothing loth  A bowl prepar'd of sav'ry broth  Which with delight the pedlar view'd  As smoaking on the board it stood  But though the very steam arose  With grateful odour to his nose  One single sip he ventur'd not  The gruel was so wondrous hot  What can be donewith gentle puff  He blows it till it's cool enough  WHY how now pedlar what's the matter  Still at thy blowing quoth the  Satyr  I blow to cool it cries the clown  That I may get the liquor down  For tho' I grant you've made it well  You've boil'd it Sir as hot as hell  THEN raising high his cloven stump  The  Satyr  smote him on the rump  "Begone thou double knave or fool  "With the same breath to warm and cool  "Friendship with such I never hold  "Who're so  damn'd  hot and so  damn'd  cold"  ☞We should be glad

NUMBER CXXVI THURSDAY  June    Proinde tona eloquio solitum tibi  VIRG  I  Remember a rector of a parish at the court end of the town who was gene∣rally accounted a very fine preacher that used to aim at delivering himself in the most bold and animated stile of oratory The tone of his voice was nicely accommodated to the different branches of his dis∣course and every thing was pronounced with uncommon energy and emphasis he also indulged himself in equal freedom of action and abounded in various extraordi∣nary gesticulations his sermons themselves were sown thick with tropes metaphors and similies and every where enriched with  apostrophe  and  prosopopaeia  AS I knew that this reverend gentleman had been abroad with a young nobleman in the capacity of a tra∣velling tutor I did not wonder at the violent exertion of his voice and the vehemence of his action as this is a piece of clerical foppery which an itinerant clergyman is apt to adopt while his pupil is gleaning all the other follies of  Paris  at which place it is very common to see a  capuchine  so heated with his subject that he often seems in danger of throwing himself out of the pulpit But I was at a loss how to account for the glowing stile of his discourses till happening to turn over the works of a celebrated  French  preacher I found that the oratorical performances of my friend were no other than faithful translations of them  THIS sort of pulpit plagiarism may perhaps be more adapted to the taste of some of our fashionable de∣claimers than the more hackneyed method of tran∣scribing a page from  Barrow Tillotson  or  Atterbury  but although such practices may be less liable to de∣tection it is certainly more orthodox to rifle the works of our own Divines than to ransack the treasures of  Romish  priests and their inflamed orations are undoubt∣edly less adapted to the genius of our people than the sober reasonings of our own preachers It must be owned indeed that some of our clergy are greatly want∣ing in that life and spirit which would render their instructions more affecting as well as more pleasing Their sermons are frequently drawn out in one continued drawl without any variation of voice or gesture so that it is no wonder if some of the congregation should be caught napping when the preacher himself hardly  seems to be awake But though this drowsy delivery is not to be commended yet a serious earnestness is most likely to engage the attention and convince the reason This manner as it is most decent in itself is best suited to an  English  audience though it is no wonder that a different strain of oratory should prevail in  France  since a  Frenchman  accompanies almost every word in ordinary conversation with some fantastic gesture and even enquires concerning your health and talks of the weather with a thousand shrugs and grimaces  BUT though I do not like to see a preacher lazily lolling on the cushion or dozing over his sermoncase and haranguing his audience with an unchristian apathy yet even this unanimated delivery is perhaps less offensive than to observe a clergyman less assiduous to instruct his audience than to be admired by them A sober divine should not ascend the pulpit with the same passions that a public orator mounts the  rostrum  much less should he assume the voice gesture and de∣portment of a player and the language of the theatre He should preserve a temperance in the most earnest parts of his discourse and go through the whole of it in such a manner as best agrees with the solemn place in which it is uttered Pompous nonsense bellowed out with a thundering accent comes with a worse grace from the pulpit than bombast and sustian injudiciously ranted forth by a  "periwigpated fellow"  on the stage I can∣not better illustrate the absurdity and indecency of this manner than by a familiar though shameful instance of it Whoever has occasionally joined with the butchers in making up the audience of the  ClareMarket  Orator will agree with me that the impropriety of his stile and the extravagance of his action become still more shocking and intolerable by the day which they pro∣phane and the ecclesiastical appearance of the place in which the declaimer harangues Thus while those who thunder out damnation from parish pulpits may from assuming the manners of the theatre be resembled to ranting players the  ClareMarket  Orator while he turns religion into farce must be considered as exhibiting shews and interludes of an inferior nature and himself regarded as a Jackpudding in a gown and cassock  A BLOATED stile is perhaps of all others least to be commended It is more frequently made a shelter for nonsense than a vehicle of truth but though improper on all occasions it more especially deviates from the chaste plainness and simplicity of Pulpit Eloquence Nor am I less displeased with those who are admired by some as  pretty  preachers as I think a clergyman may be a coxcomb in his stile and manner as well as a prig in his appearance Flowers of rhetoric injudiciously scattered over a sermon are as disgusting in his discourse as the snug wig and scented white handkerchief in his dress The  pretty  preacher aims also at politeness and goodbreeding takes the ladies to task in a genteel vein of raillery and handles their modish foibles with the same air that he gallants their fans but if he has a mind to put his abili∣ties to the stretch and indulge himself in a more than ordinary flow of rhetoric he fritters away the solemnity of some scriptural subject and I have heard a flourishing declaimer of this cast take off from the awful idea of the Passion by dwelling principally on the gracefulness of person sweetness of voice and elegance of deportment  in the Divine Sufferer and at another time in speaking of the Fall I have known him enter into a picturesque description of the woods groves and rivulets pansies pinks and violets that threw a perpetual gaiety over the face of nature in the garden of  Eden  AFFECTED oratory and an extravagant delivery were first practised by those who vary from the regular esta∣blished church nor is there any manner so unbecoming and indecent which has not at one time or another been accounted truly spiritual and graceful Snuffling through the nose with an harmonious twang has been regarded as a kind of churchmusic best calculated to raise devo∣tion and a piteous chorus of sighs and groans has been thought the most effectual call to repentance Irregular tremblings of the voice and contortions of the person have long been the eloquence of Quakers and Presbyterians and are now the favourite mode of preaching practised by those selfordained teachers who strike out new lights in religion and pour forth their extempore rhapsodies in a torrent of enthusiastical oratory An inspired cobler will thunder out anathemas with the tone and gesture of St  Paul  from a jointstool and an enlightened brick∣layer will work himself up to such a pitch of vehemence as shall make his audience quake again I am sorry to see our regular divines rather copying than reforming this hot and extravagant manner of preaching and have with pain been witness to a wild intemperate delivery in our parishchurches which I should only have expected at the chapel in  LongAcre  or at the Foundery and Ta∣bernacle in  MoorFields  AS a serious earnestness in the delivery and a nervous simplicity in the stile of a discourse are the most becom∣ing ornaments of the pulpit so an affectation of elo∣quence is no where so offensive The delivery of a preacher as well as his diction should like his dress be plain and decent Inflamed eloquence and wild gestures are unsuitable to the place and his function and though such vehement heat may perhaps kindle the zeal of a few enthusiastic old beldams in the isle it has a very dif∣ferent effect on the more rational part of the congrega∣tion I would therefore recommend it to our fashion∣able divines to aim at being Preachers rather than Orators or Actors and to endeavour to make their discourses ap∣pear like Sermons rather than Orations  Just Published  In Two Neat Pocket

THURSDAY  July    Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur  HOR  To Mr TOWN  SIR  W  E are told that in  Spain  it is the custom for husbands never to let their wives go abroad without a watchful old woman to attend them and in  Turkey  it is the fashion to lock up their mistresses under the guard of a trusty eunuch but I never knew that in any country the men were put under the same restrictions Alas Sir my wife is to me a very  Duena  she is as careful of me as the  Keisler Aga  or Chief Eunuch is of the Grand Signior's favourite Sultana  and whether she believes that I am in love with every woman or that every woman is in love with me she will never trust me out of her sight but sticks as close to me as if she really was without a figure bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh I am never suffered to stir abroad without her lest I should go astray and at home she follows me up and down the house like a child in leadingstrings nay if I do but step down stairs on any ordinary occasion she is so afraid I shall give her the slip that she always screams after me  "my dear you are not going out"  though for better security she generally locks up my hat and cane together with her own gloves and cardinal that one might not stir out without the other  I CANNOT flatter myself that I am handsomer or better made than other men nor has she in my eyes at least fewer charms than other women Need I add that my complexion is not oversanguine nor my constitution very robust Besides we have not been married above a month And yet she is so very doubtful of my con∣stancy that I cannot speak or even pay the compliment of my hat to any young lady though in public without giving new alarms to her jealousy Such an one she is sure from her flaunting airs is a kept madam another is no better than she should be and she saw another tip me the wink or give me a nod as a mark of some private assignation between us A nun Sir might as soon force her way into a convent of monks as any young woman get admittance into our house she has therefore affronted all her acquaintance of her own sex that are not or might not have been the grandmothers  of many generations and is at home to nobody but maiden ladies in the bloom of threescore and beauties of the last century  SHE will scarce allow me to mix even with persons of my own sex and she looks upon batchelors in particular as no better than pimps and common seducers One evening she indeed vouchsafed to trust me out of doors at a tavern with some of my malefriends but the first bottle had scarce gone round before word was brought up that my boy was come with the lanthorn to light me home I sent him back with orders to call in an hour when presently after the maid was dispatched with no∣tice that my dear was gone to bed very ill and wanted me directly I was preparing to obey the summons when to our great surprize the sick lady herself bolted into the room complained of my cruel heart and fell into a fit from which she did not recover till the coach had set us down at our own house She then called me the ba∣sest of husbands and said that all taverns were no better than bawdyhouses and that men only went thither to meet naughty women at last she declared it to be her firm resolution that I should never set my foot again in any one of them except herself be allowed to make one of the company  YOU will suppose Sir that while my wife is thus cautious that I should not be led astray when abroad she takes particular care that I should not stumble on tempta∣tions at home For this reason as soon as I had brought her to my house my two maidservants were imme∣diately turned away at a moment's warning not with∣out  out many covert hints and some open accusations of too near an intimacy between us though I protest to you one was a feeble old wrinkled creature as haggard and frightful as mother  Shipton  and the other a strapping wench as coarse and brawny as the Female  Samson  Even my man  John  who had lived in the family for thir∣ty years was packed off as being too well acquainted with his master's sly ways A chairwoman was forced to do our work for some time before madam could suit herself with maids for her purpose One was too pert an hussy another went too fine another was an impudent forward young baggage At present our household is made up of such beautiful monsters as  Caliban  himself might fall in love with my lady's own waitingwoman has a most inviting humpback and is so charmingly pa∣ralytic that she shakes all over like a  Chinese  figure the housemaid squints most delightfully with one soli∣tary eye which weeps continually for the loss of its fel∣low and the cook besides a most captivating red face and protuberant waist has a most graceful hobble in her gait occasioned by one leg being shorter than the other  I NEED not tell you that I must never write a letter but madam must see the contents before it is done up and that I never durst open one till she has broke the seal or read it till she has first run it over Every rap from the postman at the door makes her tremble and I have known her ready to burst with spleen at seeing a superscription written in a fair  Italian  hand though perhaps it only comes from my aunt in the country She can pick out an intrigue even from the impression on the wax and a cupid or two hearts joined  in union or a wafer pricked with a pin or stamped with a thimble she interprets as the certain tokens of a billet∣doux The other week I received a letter from  Derbyshire  which awakened all her mistrust She knew from the scrawl and strange spelling on the outside that it must come from a woman she therefore tore it open in a violent rage in hopes of making a most ma∣terial discovery but to her great disappointment the con∣tents were perfectly illegible She was now convinced that it came from some nasty creature whom I maintained in the country and that we corresponded together in cypher I was obliged to confess the truth that it was indeed drawn up in cypher and that I had the key to it At length with much ado I explained the whole matter to her telling her that it was a letter from my farmer who not having been bred at a writingschool expressed his meaning by characters of his own invention However this assurance did not at all pacify her till she had dispatched a trusty messenger to be certified of the truth  THIS loving creature happened to be taken ill lately when she thought that she was going to die She called me to her bedside and with tears in her eyes told me that she should not be able to die in peace except I would promise her one thing I assured her I would promise any thing to make her easy  "O my dear says she I cannot bear the thought of your being another's and therefore I shall not rest in my grave if you do not swear to me that you will never marry again or think of another woman as long as you  live"  My poor dear is however recovered with∣out putting my faith to so hard a trial though I may venture to say that I have already had so much of matrimony I could submit to any conditions to part with her  I am Sir Your very humble servant  c  Just Published  In Two Neat

CXXVIII THURSDAY  July    Felix convivium in quod choraules non venit  MART  To Mr TOWN  SIR  M  Y wife is mad stark mad and unless you can prescribe some remedy for that strange phrenzy that possesses her my peace of mind must be for ever broken and my fortune in∣evitably ruined You must know sir that she is afflicted with a disorder exactly opposite to the bite of a  Tarantula  for as that is said to admit of no cure but music there is not a note in the  Gamut  but what tends to heighten and inflame my wife's lunacy I find it is the fashion in this age for singers and fidlers to publish Appeals to the public wherefore as you have hitherto listened to the complaints of husbands I must beg you now to consider  mine and to suffer me also to Appeal to the public by means of your paper  A FEW years ago business called me over to  Italy  where this unfortunate woman received the first touches of this disorder She soon conceived a violent passion for Taste in general which settled at last in an unquenchable rage after musical compositions Solos Sonatas Operas and Con∣certos became her sole employment and delight and singers and musicians her only company At length full of  Italian  airs she returned to  England  where also her whole happiness has been centered in the orchestra and it has been her whole pride to be thought a  Connoisseur  in music If there is an opera oratorio or concert to be performed within the bills of mortality I do not believe that the riches of the  Indies  could prevail on her to be absent Two and only two good consequences attend this madness and those are that she constantly attends St  James  's chapel for the sake of the anthem and the rest of the music and out of the many pounds idly squandered on minums and semi∣quavers some few are dedicated to charities which are pro∣moted by musical performances  BUT what makes this rage after catgut more irksome and intolerable to me is that I have not myself the least idea of what they call Taste and it almost drives me mad to be pestered with it I am a plain man and have not the least spice of a  Connoisseur  in my composition yet nothing will satisfy my wife unless I appear as fond of such nonsense as herself About a month ago she prevailed on me to attend her to the Opera where every dying fall made her expire as well as Lady  Townly  She was ravished with one air in  extasies at another applauded  Ricciarelli  encored  Mingotti  and in short acted like an absolute madwoman while the performance and her behaviour had a quite different effect upon me who sat dumb with confusion  "most musical most melancholy"  at her elbow When we came home again she seemed as happy as harmony could make her but I must own that I was all discord and most heartily vexed at being made a fool in public  "Well my dear said she how do you like the opera"  "Zouns madam I would as soon be dragged through a horsepond as go to an opera with you again"  "O fie but you must be delighted with  The Mingotti  "  "The Mingotti  The Devil  "  "Well I am sorry for it Sir  Aaron  but I find you have no Ear"  "Ear madam I had rather cut off my ears than suffer them to make me an ideot"  To this she made me no reply but began a favourite opera tune and after taking a tour round the room like one of the singers left me alone  IF my wife could be satisfied like other musical ladies with attending public performances and now and then thrumming on her harpsicord the tunes she hears there I should be content But she has also a concert of her own constantly once a week Here she is in still greater raptures than at the opera as all the music is chosen and appointed by herself The expence of this whim is monstrous for not one of these people will open their mouths or rosin a single string without being very well paid for it Then she must have all the best hands and voices and has almost as large a set of performers in pay as the manager of the opera It puts me quite out of patience to see these fellows strutting about my house drest up like lords and gentlemen Not a  single fiddler or singer but what appears in lace or embroidery and I once mistook my wife's chief musi∣cian for a foreign ambassador  IT is impossible to recount the numberless follies to which this ridiculous passion for Music exposes her Her devotion to the art makes her almost adore the professors of it A musician is a greater man in her eye than a duke and she would sooner oblige an operasinger than a countess She is as busy in promoting their benefits as if she was to have the receipts of the house and quarrels with all her ac∣quaintance who will not permit her to load them with tick∣ets Every fidler in town makes it his business to scrape an acquaintance with her and an  Italian  is no sooner imported than she becomes a part of my wife's band of performers In the late Opera disputes she has been a most furious parti∣zan and it is impossible for any patriot to feel more anxiety for the danger of  Blakeney  and  Minorca  than she has suffered on account of the Opera and the loss of  Mingotti  I DO not believe my wife has a single idea except recita∣tive airs countertenor thoroughbass c which are perpetually singing in her head When we sit together instead of joining in any agreeable conversation she is always either humming a tune or  "discoursing most eloquent music"  Nature has denied her a voice but as  Italy  has given her Taste and a graceful manner she is continually squeaking out strains less melodious than the harmony of balladsinging in our streets or psalmsinging in a country church To make her still more ridiculous she learns to play on that masculine instrument the bassviol the pleasure of which nothing can prevail on her to forego as the  bassviol she daily tells me contains the whole power and very soul of harmony  WHAT method Mr TOWN shall I persue to cure my wife of this musical phrenzy I have some thoughts of holding weekly a burlesque  Rorotorio  composed of mockairs with grand accompanyments of the Jew's Harp Wooden Spoons and Marrowbones and Cleavers on the same day with my wife's concert and have actually sent to two of Mrs  Midnight  's hands to teach me the art and mystery of playing on the Broomstick and HurdyGurdy at the same time that my wife learns on the bassviol I have also a strong rough voice which will enable me to roar out  Bumper  Squire Jones  Roast Beef  or some other old  English  ballad whenever she begins to trill forth her melodious airs in  Italian  If this has no effect I will learn to beat the drum or wind the posthorn and if I should still find it impossible for noise and clamour to overcome the sound of her voices and instruments I have halfresolved peremptorily to shut my doors against singers and fidlers and even to demolish her harpsichord and bassviol  BUT this alas is coming to extremities which I am almost afraid to venture and would endeavour to avoid I have no aversion to music but I would not be a fidler nor do I dislike company but I would as soon keep an inn as convert my house into a theatre for all the idle things of both sexes to assemble at But my wife's affections are so wedded to the  Gamut  that I cannot devise any means to wean her from this folly If I could make her fond of dress or teach her to love cards plays or any thing but music I should be happy This method of destroying  my peace with harmony is no better than tickling me to death and to squander away such sums of money on a parcel of bawling scraping rascals in laced coats and bagwigs is absolutely giving away my estate for an old song You Mr TOWN are a professed  Connoisseur  therefore either give me a little Taste or teach my wife to abandon it for at present we are

of being indulged in all my odd humours and always having my own way This is one reason I never married for if my wife had been a shrewish termagant she would have killed me and if she had been a tame domestic animal I should have killed her but the way of life I have now fallen into is of all others the best calculated to gratify my fantastical temper I have no near relation indeed to treat as an humble cousin all my life in hopes of being happy at my death yet I abound in sycophants and followers all whom I delude  like another  Volpone  with the expectations of being made my heir The abject spirit of these wretches flatters me and amuses me I am indolent and hate contradiction and can safely say that not one of my acquaintance has contra∣dicted me for these seven years There is not one of them but would be glad if I would spit in his face or rejoice at a kick of the breech from me if they thought I meant it as a token of my familiarity When I am grave they appear as dull as mutes at a funeral when I smile they grin like monkies when I tell a silly story they chuckle over every ridiculous particular and shake their sides in admiration of my wit Sometimes I pretend to be shortsighted and then not one of them sees farther than his nose They swallow sour wine eat musty victuals and are proud to ride in my old boots  I HAVE been told of a certain prelate who brought his chaplains to such a degree of servility that after every deal at whist they would ask him what he would chuse to have for trumps next deal I keep my fellows in equal good order They all think me a close old hunks and imagining that winning their money will put me in good humour with them they practice all the arts of sharping to cheat them∣selves I have known them pack the cards at Whist that I might hold all the four honours in my own hand they will load the dice in my favour at Hazard pocket themselves on purpose at Billiards and at Bowls if any one is near win∣ning the game he never fails in the next cast to mistake his biass It is impossible for the most despotic monarch to be more absolute over his subjects than I am over these slaves and sycophants Yet in spite of all their endeavours to oblige me I most heartily despise them and have al∣ready  drawn up a will in which I have bequeathed to each of them a shilling and a dogcollar  BUT though I have settled in my mind what legacies I shall leave them I have not thoroughly resolved in what manner I shall dispose of the bulk of my estate Indeed I am fully determined like most other wealthy bachelors either to leave my fortune to some ostentatious pious uses or to persons whom I have never seen and for whose cha∣racters I have not the least regard or esteem To speak sin∣cerely ostentation carries away my whole heart but then it is a little difficult to find out a new object to indulge my va∣nity whilst I am on this side the grave by securing to me a certain prospect of posthumous fame which is always so agreeable to living pride  THE hospitals are so numerous that my name will be lost among those more known and established of  Guy Morden Bancroft  and I know not who Besides in the space of four or five centuries perhaps it may be thought notwithstanding my whole length picture and statue that I had assistance from parliament If I order my money to be laid out in churches they will never be built If in temple gardens lakes obelisks and serpentine rivers the next generation of the sons of Taste will demolish all my works turn my rounds into squares and my squares into rounds and not leave even my bust although it were cast a plaister of  Paris  by Mr  Racstrow  or worked up in wax by Mr  Goupy  Or supposing in imitation of some of my predecessors I were to bequeath my fortune to my housekeeper and recommend her in my will as a pattern of virtue diligence and every good quality what will be the effect In three weeks  after my death she will marry an  Irishman  and I shall not even enjoy my monument and marble perriwig in  WestminsterAbby  NOTHING perplexes me so much as the disposal of my money by my last will and testament While I am living it procures the most servile compliance with all my whims from my sycophants and several other conveniences but I would fain buy fame with it after my death Do but in∣struct me how I may lay it out in the most valuable pur∣chases of this sort only discover some new object of charity and perhaps I may bequeath you a round sum of money for your advice  I am SIR Your humble Servant THOMAS VAINALL  IT is said by an old poet that no man's life can be called happy or unhappy till his death in like manner I have often thought that no words or actions are a better comment on a person's temper and disposition than his last will and testament This is a true portraiture of himself drawn at full length by his own hand in which the painting is com∣monly very lively and the features very strongly marked In the discharge of this solemn act people sign and seal themselves either wise and good characters or villains and sools and any person that makes a ridiculous will and be∣queaths his money to frivolous uses only takes a great deal of pains like  Dogberry  in the play  "that he may be set down and ass"  THE love of fame governs our actions more universally than any other passion All the rest gradually drop off but this runs through our whole lives This perhaps is one of the chief inducements that influences wealthy per∣sons to bequeath their possessions to ostentatious uses and they would as willingly lay out a considerable sum in buying a great name if possible at their deaths as they would bestow it on the purchase of a coat of heraldry during their lives They are pleased with leaving some memorial of their existence behind them and to perpetuate the remembrance of themselves by the application of their money of some vainglorious purposes though the good gentlemen never did one act to make themselves remarkable laid out a single shilling in a laudable manner while they lived If an  Apotheosis  were to be bought how many rich scoundrels would be deified after their deaths not a plumb in the city but would purchase this imaginary godship as readily as he paid for his freedom at his first setting up and I doubt not but this fantastical distinction would be more frequent on an escutcheon than a coronet  THE disposal of our fortunes by our last will should be considered as the discharge of a sacred trust which we should endeavour to execute in a just manner and as we have had the enjoyment of rich possessions we ought care∣fully to provide that they may devolve to those who have the most natural claim to them They who may first de∣mand our favour are those who are allied to us by the ties of blood next to these stand those persons to whom we are connected by friendship and next to our friends and rela∣tions mankind in general But the humanity of a tes∣tator will not be thought very extensive though it reaches  to posterity or includes the poor in general if it neg∣lects the objects of charity immediately under his eye or those individuals who have the best title to his benevolence  Virgil  has placed those rich men who bestowed none of their wealth on their relations among the chief personages in his Hell Wherefore I would advise my good correspondent Mr  Vainall  first to consider whether he has not some poor relation starving perhaps in some distant part of the king∣dom after that let him look round whether he has not some friends whom he may possibly relieve from misery and distress But if he has no relation nor no person in the world that has any regard for him before he begins to en∣dow a college or found an hospital I should take it as a par∣ticular

passion for music and can there be a nobler or a more generous one My nerves are naturally strung to harmony and variously affected by the various combinations of the  Gamut  Some stay in  Italy  added skill and taste in composition to my natural happy disposition to music and the best judges as well as the best performers in that country allowed me to have an uncommon share of  virtù  I both compose and per∣form sir and though I say it perhaps few even of the profession possess the  contrapunto  and the  cromatic  bet∣ter and I have had the unspeakable pleasure of hearing my compositions and my performances dignified in  Italy  with the unanimous appellations of  squisito divino  and  adorevole  IS there any madness in this Does not he better de∣serve that imputation whose breast is insensible and im∣penetrable to all charms and powers of harmony To be plain I mean my husband whom I have frequently seen yawn nay leave the room in the middle of the most touching pathetic sung by the most affecting  Sig∣nora Mingotti  accompanied by the divine  Signor di Giar∣dino  And yetpardon this digressive transporthow irresistible is the expression the melody the cadences the  appogyraturas  of that incomparable  virtuosa  What energy what delicacy and what variety are in the in∣imitable  compositions and execution of the charming  Sig∣nor di Giardino  What an  arpeggio  he has what a  stacca∣to  what an  andante  In short I may I am sure with truth assert that whether in the  allegro  or the  piano  the  adagio  the  largo  or the  forte  he never had his equal O Mr TOWN what an irretrievable loss has this coun∣try sustained My good man among his other qualifi∣cations is a politician you must know and one of his principal objections against these  virtuosi  is that they are foreigners He flew into a violent passion with me last  Sunday  night because I had a concert at my house when he said such bad news were received from abroad I know not what he and other muddyheaded politicians may think but let him talk what he will of THE  Blakeney  THE Governor THE Admiral I am sure the nation cannot sustain a greater evil than the loss of THE  Mingotti  who as the public prints will inform you  "is gone to  Holland  till her affairs in  England  can be settled"  BUT however gothic my husband may be I am fully determined to discharge the duty of a good wife Ac∣cordingly whenever he comes into my room I sit down to my harpsichord and sing and play the most soothing pieces of music in hopes some time or other of hitting his unison but hitherto to no purpose and to say the truth I fear he has not one harmonic nerve in his whole system though otherwise a man of good plain sense When he interrupts my performances as in his letter he owns that he does with wishing for the men from  Mother Midnight's  with their wooden spoons saltboxes jewsharps and broomsticks to play in concert with me I answer him with all gentleness and calmness ima∣ginable  "Indeed my dear you have not the least no∣tion of these things It would be impossible to bring those ridiculous instruments into a concert and to adapt a thorough bass to them they have not above three notes at most and those cannot be  softenute  "  I wish  "for all that answers he that they were here I should like them better than all your  Signors  and  Signoras  and I am sure they would cost a great deal less"  THIS article of  expence  he often dwells upon and sometimes even with warmth to which I reply with all the mildness that becomes a good wife  "My dear you have a good fortune of your own and I brought you still a better Of what use is money if not em∣ployed and how can it be better employed than in encouraging and rewarding distinguished  gusto  and merit These people that you call balladsingers and pipers are people of birth though for the most part of small fortunes and they are much more consi∣dered as you know in  Italy  than all the greatest antient  Roman  heroes if revived would now be Many of them who would perhaps make a figure in the church or the state have been considerable losers by devoting themselves to the pleasures of mankind They leave their own country where they are infinitely esteemed for their moral as well as their musical characters and generously sacrifice all  these advantages to our diversion Besides my dear what should we do wish our money would you lavish it away upon foundling bastards lyingin women who have either no husbands or too many importunate beggars all whose cries and complaints are the most shocking discords or suppose that we were to save our money and leave our children better fortunes who knows but they might as too many do squander them away idly whereas what we give to these  virtuosi  we know is given to merit For my own part my dear I have infinite pleasure when I can get any of them to accept of fifty or an hundred guineas which by the way cannot always be brought about without some art and contri∣vance for they are most exceedingly nice and de∣licate upon the point of honour especially in the article of money And I look upon such trifling presents as a debt due to superior talents and merit and I endeavour to insinuate them in a way that the receiver may not blush"  Here my husband breaks out into a violent passion and says  "Oons madam show me a  virtuoso  or a  virtuosa  as you call them who ever blushed in their lives and I will give them the fee simple of my estate"  You see Mr TOWN what a strange man he is that he has no idea of elegance and  divertimenti  and when he is so violently in  alt  I will leave you to judge who it is that is mad stark mad  IN short sir my husband is insensible untuneable to the most noble generous and strongest of all hu∣man  passions a passion for music That divine passion alone engrosses the whole soul and leaves no room for lesser and vulgar cares for you must certainly have ob∣served Mr TOWN that whoever has a passion for and a thorough knowledge of music is fit for no one other thing Thus truly informed of my case I am sure you will judge equitably between Sir  Aaron  and  Your faithful humble servant MARIA HUMKIN  Just

social offices of life as Indolence An idle man is a mere blank in the creation he seems made for no end and lives to no purpose He can∣not engage himself in any employment or profession be∣cause he will never have diligence enough to follow it he can succeed in no undertaking for he will never persue it he must be a bad husband father and relation for he will not take the least pains to preserve his wife children and family from starving and he must be a worthless friend for he would not draw his hand from his bosom though to  prevent the destruction of the universe If he is born poor he will remain so all his life which he will probably end in a ditch or at the gallows if he embarks in trade he will be a bankrupt and if he is a person of fortune he stew∣ards will acquire immense estates and he himself perhaps will die in the  Fleet  IT should be considered that nature did not bring us into the world in a state of perfection but has left us in a capacity of improvement which should seem to intimate that we should labour to render ourselves excellent Very few are such absolute ideots as not to be able to become at least decent if not eminent in their several stations by unwearied and keen application nor are there any possest of such transcendant genius and abilities as to render all pains and diligence unnecessary Perseverance will over∣come difficulties which at first appear insuperable and it is amazing to consider how great and numerous obstacles may be removed by a continual attention to any particular point I will not mention here the trite example of  De∣mosthenes  who got over the greatest natural impediments to oratory but content myself with a more modern and fami∣liar instance Being at  Sadler's Wells  a few nights ago I could not but admire the surprizing feats of activity there exhibited and at the same time reflected what incredible pains and labour it must have cost the performers to ar∣rive at the art of writhing their bodies into such various and unnatural contortions But I was most taken with the ingenious artist who after fixing two bells to each foot the same number to each hand and with great propriety placing a cap and bells on his head played several tunes and went through as regular triple peals  and  Bob Majors  as the boys at  Christ Church  Hospital all which he effected by the due jerking of his arms and legs and nodding his head backward and forward If this artist had taken equal pains to employ his head in another way he might perhaps have been as deep a proficient in numbers as  Jedediah Buxton  or at least a tolerable modern rhimer of which he is now no bad emblem and if our fine ladies would use equal diligence they might fashion their minds as successfully as Madam  Catharina  distorts her body  THERE is not in the world a more useless idle animal than he who contents himself with being merely a Gentle∣man He has an estate therefore he will not endeavour to acquire knowledge he is not to labour in any vocation therefore he will do nothing But the misfortune is that there is no such thing in nature as negative virtue and that absolute idleness is impracticable He who does no good will certainly do mischief and the mind if it is not stored with useful knowledge will necessarily become a magazine of nonsense and trifles Wherefore a Gentleman though he is not obliged to rise to open his shop or work at his trade may always find some ways of employing his time to advantage If he makes no advances in wisdom he will become more and more a slave to folly and he that does nothing because he has nothing to do will become vicious and abandoned or at best ridiculous and contemptible  THERE is not a more melancholy object than a man of an honest heart and fine natural abilities whose good quali∣ties are thus destroyed by Indolence Such a person is a constant plague to all his friends and acquaintance with all the means in his power of adding to their happiness and  suffers himself to rank among the lowest characters when he might render himself conspicuous among the highest Nobody is more universally beloved and more universally avoided than my friend  Careless  He is a humane man who never did a beneficent action and a man of unshaken integrity on whom it is impossible to depend With the best head and the best heart he regulates his conduct in the most absurd manner and frequently injures his friends for whoever neglects to do justice to himself must in∣evitably wrong those with whom he is connected and it is by no means a true maxim that an idle man hurts nobody but himself  VIRTUE then is not to be considered in the light of mere innocence or abstaining from harm but as the exertion of our faculties in doing good as  Titus  when he had let a day slip undistinguished by some act of virtue cried out  "I have lost a day"  If we regard our time in this light how many days shall we look back upon as irretrievably lost and to how narrow a compass would such a method of cal∣culation frequently reduce the longest life If we were to number our days according as we have applied them to virtue it would occasion strange revolutions in the manner of reckoning the ages of men We should see some few men arrived to a good old age in the prime of their youth and meet with several young fellows of fourscore  AGREEABLE to this way of thinking I remember to have met with the epitaph of an aged man four years old dating his existence from the time of his reformation from evil courses The inscriptions on most tombstones commemo∣rate no acts of virtue performed by the persons who lie under  them but only record that they were born one day and died another But I would fain have those people whose lives have been useless rendered of some service after their deaths by affording lessons of instruction and morality to those they leave behind them Wherefore I could wish that in every parish several acres were marked out for a new and spacious BuryingGround in which every person whose remains are there deposited should have a small stone laid over them reckon∣ing their age according to the manner in which they have improved or abused the time allotted them in their lives In such circumstances the plate on a coffin might be the high∣est panegyric which the deceased could receive and a lit∣tle square stone inscribed with  Ob Ann Aetat  would be a nobler eulogium than all the lapidary adulation of mo∣dern epitaphs In a BuryingGround of this nature allow∣ing for the partiality of survivors which would certainly point out the most brilliant actions of their dead friends we might perhaps see some inscriptions not much unlike the following  Here lie the remains of a celebrated Beauty aged who died in the fifth year of her age She was born in her eighteenth year and was untimely killed by the small pox in her twenty third  Here rests in eternal sleep the mortal part of L  B  a Free∣thinker aged an Infant He came into the world by chance in the year and was  annihilated  in the first year of his age  Here continue to rot the bones of a noted Buck an em∣bryo who never shewed any signs of life and after twenty  three years was so totally putrified that it could not be kept above ground any longer  Here lies the swoln carcase of a Boon Companion who was born in a dropsy in the th year of his age He lin∣gered in this condition till he was obliged to be tapped when he relapsed into his former condition and died in the second year of his age and the d of his drinking  Here lies  Isaac DaCosta  a convert from Judaism aged He was born and christened in his st year and died in the true Faith in the third year of his age  Here is deposited the body of the celebrated Beau  Tawdry  who was born at court in the

et arceo  HOR  I  KNOW not any greater misfortune that can happen to a young fellow at his first setting out in life than his falling into Low Company He that sinks to a familiarity with persons much below his own level will be constantly weighed down by his base connections and though he may easily plunge still lower he will find it impossible ever to rise again We cannot give a liberal  turn of mind to a vulgar by introducing him to genteel company any more than we can make a beau of him by dressing him in embroidery but a gentlemen will as na∣turally catch the manners of a blackguard by mixing with blackguards as he would daub his cloaths with foot by running against a chimneysweeper  BY Low Company I would not be supposed to mean the best and most valuable part of mankind which have been distinguished by the name of Middling sort of people though I am not ignorant that these are despised by all who would be thought to keep the Best Company The apes of quality affect to look upon all others who have no relish for the amusements of high life or do not chuse to pay a guinea for their ordinary as downright vulgars and it was with the utmost contempt I once heard a young coxcomb of fashion speak of a most inti∣mate friend  "that he should be forced to drop his ac∣quaintance because he kept such low company"  Nei∣ther would I confine this appellation solely to the inferior order of tradesmen and mechanics or the whole body of the mobility in general for although this rank of people may be literally said to be in low life a right honourable who lets himself down to the manners of a porter or a hackneycoachman differs from them in nothing but his title  A PROPENSITY to Low Company is either owing to an original meanness of spirit a want of education or  an illplaced pride commonly arising from both the forementioned causes Those who are naturally of a grovelling disposition shew it even at school by chusing their playmates from the scum of the class and are never so happy as when they can steal down to romp with the servants in the kitchen But the most frequent cause is the desire of being as it is called the head of the company and a person of this humble ambition will be very well content to pay the reckoning for the honour of being distinguished by the title of The Gentle∣man It sometimes happens that a man of genius and learning will stoop to receive the incense of mean and illiterate flatterers in a porterhouse or a cydercellar and I remember to have heard of a poet who was once caught in a bawdyhouse in the very fact of reading his verses to the good old mother and a circle of her daughters  THERE are some who have been led into Low Company merely from an affectation of Humour and from a notion of seeing life and a desire of being ac∣counted men of humour have descended to associate with the meanest of the mob and picked their cronies from  WhiteChapel  and  Broad St Giles  's Of these cha∣racters the most remarkable is a young fellow of family and fortune who was born and bred a gentleman but has taken great pains to degrade himself and is now as complete a blackguard as those whom he has chosen for his companions He will drink purl in a  morning smoke his pipe in a nightcellar and eat black puddings at  Bartholomew Fair  for the Humour of the thing All the while he is reckoned by his friends to be a mighty goodnatured gentleman and without the least bit of pride in him  IN order to qualify himself for the society of the vulgar  Bob  has studied and practised all the vulgar arts under the best masters He has therefore cultivated an intimacy with  Buckhorse  and is very proud of being sometimes admitted to the honour of conversing with the great  Broughton  himself He is also very well known among the hackneycoachmen as a brother∣whip but his greatest excellence is cricketplaying in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the  Bennets  and is at length arrived at the supreme dig∣nity of being distinguished among his brethren of the wicket by the title of  Long Robin  IT is diverting enough to consider the fate of many of  Bob  's intimate friends and acquaintance It must be owned that some of these have come to an untimely end that some have been sent abroad and others been set in the pillory or whipt in  Bridewell  One of  Bob  's favourite amusements is attending the executions at  Tyburn  and it once happened that one of his com∣panions was unfortunately brought thither when  Bob  carried his regard for his deceased friend so far as to  get himself knocked down in endeavouring to rescue the body from the surgeons  As  Bob  constantly affects to mimic the air and man∣ners of the vulgar he takes care to enrich his conver∣sation with the emphatical oaths and expressive dialect of  Billingsgate  and  St Giles  's which never fails to re∣commend him as a man of excellent humour among the  Choice Spirits  and the  Sons of sound sense and satis∣faction  and frequently promotes him to the chair in these facetious societies But he is particularly famous for singing those  Cant Songs  drawn up in the lingo of sharpers and pickpockets the humour of which he greatly sets off and heightens by screwing up his mouth and rolling about a large quid of tobacco be∣tween his jaws  BOB  has indulged the same notions of humour even in his amours and he is well known to every streetwalker between  CharingCross  and  CheapSide  This has ruined his constitution and often involved him in several unluckly scrapes He has been fre∣quently bruised beat and kicked by the bullies in  FleetDitch  and  BloodBowl Alley  and he was once soundly drubbed by a soldier for engaging with his trull in St  James  's Park The last time I saw him he was laid up with two black eyes and a broken pate which he got in a midnight skirmish about a mistress in a nightcellar He had carried down a  bunter which he had picked up in the streets in order to treat her with a

Camaenis  CO LITT  To Mr TOWN  Middle Temple  SIR  I  F we look into the several inns of court the profest students of the law compose a very numerous body but if we afterwards turn our eyes on those few who are employed in exercising their talents in  WestminsterHall  this prodigious army of lawyers shrinks to a very thin and inconsiderable corps Thousands it seems are disgusted with the unpleasing dryness of the study as it is now ma∣naged and conceive an unconquerable aversion to the white  leaves and the old black letter This early dislike to legal enquiries certainly proceeds from the fatal mistakes in the plan of study hitherto marked out According to all systems now extant it is absolutely impossible to be at once a lawyer and a fine gentleman Seeing with concern the many evils arising from these erroneous principles I have at length devised a method to remedy all these inconveniences a method now very successfully practised by several young gentlemen Wherefore I must beg leave to submit my thoughts to the public by means of your paper and to chalk out the out∣lines of a treatise now ready for the press intitled  The Com∣plete Barrister  or  a New Institute of the Laws of England  MY Lord  Coke  prescribes to our student to follow the ad∣vice given in the ancient verses prefixed to this letter for the good spending of the day  "Six hours to sleep six to the study of the law four to prayer two to meals and the rest to the Muses"  But what an absurd and un∣fashionable distribution of the four and twenty hours I will venture a thousand pounds to a shilling that not one student in the kingdom divides his time in this manner Here is not a single word of  Vauxhall Ranelagh  the theatres or other public diversions not to mention that nobody but a methodist would ever think of praying four hours and that it would be impossible though we were content with snap∣ping up a chop every day at  Betty  's to dispatch even dinner in two How then shall we reconcile these precepts scarce practicable by a hermit to the life of a young gentleman who keeps the best company Or how can these rules for severe application be made consistent with the practice of those who divide their whole time between eating drink∣ing sleeping and amusements Well knowing that the  volatile dispositions of the young gentlemen of the present age can never submit the ordering of their lives to any pre∣scribed rules I have endeavoured to square my precepts to their lives and have so contrived the matter that amidst the keenest persuit of their pleasures they shall be engaged in the most improving course of the law  AS laws are chiefly nothing else but rules of action what can be more cruel and absurd than to coop up a brisk young man to learn in his chambers what he can so much better teach himself by going abroad into the world I propose to dose gentlemen with study as Dr  Rock  does with physic to be taken at home or abroad without loss of time or hindrance of business This I am convinced is not only the best me∣thod but also the only scheme which several inhabitants of the inns of court would ever follow I shall not at present forestall the contents of my treatise by presenting you with a dry abstract of it but rather endeavour to give you an idea of the spirit and manner in which it is written by delineating the plan diligently persued by one of my favourite pupils and I cannot but congratulate the bar that so many young men instead of blinding their eyes and bewildering their under∣standings with  Coke Plowden Salkeld  c have sense enough to follow the same course of study  TOM RIOT the principal ornament of my class of stu∣dents was sent to the  Temple  not with any intention that he should become a great lawyer but merely because for a few years his father did not know how to dispose of him other∣wise but so unwearied has been his application to the new method that his father and the rest of his friends will I doubt not be surprized at his wonderful proficiency As  nothing is of more consequence to those gentlemen who in∣tend to harangue at the bar than the acquiring a ready elo∣cution and an easy habit of delivering their thoughts in pub∣lic to this I paid particular attention For this purpose I advised him to a diligent attendance on the theatres and I assure you Mr TOWN he never fails to take notes at a new play and seldom or never misses appearing at one house or the other in the green boxes He has also gathered many beautiful flowers of rhetorick unblown upon by all other orators ancient or modern from the  Robin Hood  Society and at the same place he has collected the strongest argu∣ments on every subject and habituated himself to modes of reasoning never hitherto introduced into courts of justice But what has been of more than ordinary service to him and is particularly recommended by Lord  Coke  himself who calls  "conference the life of study"  is his so frequent atten∣dance at  George  's and the other coffeehouses about the  Tem∣ple  where every student has so many opportunities of bene∣fiting himself by daily conversation with counsellors attor∣nies clerks to attornies and other sages of law  THE law is intended to take cognisance of all our actions wherefore my pupil who is fond of exerting his faculties in polite life has already digested almost all the grand lead∣ing points of the law into a journal of his transactions which I shall lay before my readers at large in my treatise as the best method for a commonplacebook Thus for instance having been frequently employed after leaving the  Shake∣speare  in what is called  beating the rounds  it has happened to him to be taken into custody by the magistrate of the night and carried the next morning before a justice by which means he has attained as full a knowledge of certain parts of the duty of a constable and justice of peace as could be collected from  Dalton Blackerby  or  Burn  Certain impertinences of his taylor and other tradesmen have given him a very clear notion of the laws of arrest and been of as  much service to him as the best treatises on bail and mainprize Besides which the several sums of money which he has taken up at different times payable on his father's death have opened to him some difficult points in conveyancing by teaching him the nature of bonds deeds c and have at the same time shewn him what Lord  Coke  calls  "the ami∣able and admirable secrets of the common law"  by un∣ravelling to him the intricate doctrines of reversion and re∣mainder as well as the general nature of estates Thus he is continually improving and whenever he should happen to commit a rape or a genteel murder it will serve him for matter of instruction as well as any history of the pleas of the crown and give him an insight into the nature of the prac∣tice and extent of the jurisdiction of our courts of justice  BY this plan of study no time is lost so that while other students are idling away their vacation in the country my pupil is daily improving there As he is a member of the association he is very conversant in all the laws enacted for the preservation of the game and he picks up all the learning of the circuit by dancing at the Balls at the assizes As his father has a place he is employed in canvassing for votes at the time of an election which instructs him in all the points of law touching those matters He was principally concerned in discovering the  Customary Tenants  the new species of freeholders unknown to  Littleton Coke  and all the lawyers of antiquity and he is so intimately acquainted with all the doctrine contained in the several clauses of the bribery act that I propose publishing in the body of my treatise  Les Read∣ings Del Mon Seignior  RIOT  Sur L'Estatute de    Geo  c  BY this time Mr TOWN you must perceive that the ground of my scheme is in short no more than this  viz  that the student should regard his life as a kind of commentary on the law as it is recommended to the clergy to become examples of the doctrine they teach Or to bring my illus∣tration more home to these gentlemen let them learn the law by being occasionally interested in different parts of it  as they become in some measure doctors of physic from fre∣quent need of it and can cure themselves in certain cases as well as  Rock  himself Instead of poring over books a gen∣tleman need only observe how far the law and his actions tally with each other and as it is said by Lord  Coke  "that the knowledge of the law is like a deep well out of which each man draweth according to the strength of his understanding"  so in persuance of my plan the student will improve according to the eagerness with which he engages in his pleasures and this no doubt was intended by Lord  Coke  as it is the most obvious inter∣pretation of his words when he concludes the comparison by saying that  "when the professor of the law can dive into the depth it is  delightful easy  and  without any heavy bur∣then  so long as he keep himself  in his own proper element  "  WHAT plan Mr TOWN can be more  delightful easy  and  without any heavy burthen  than Institutes of this nature I have indeed often looked with concern upon those unhappy gentlemen who have impaired their health by the old me∣thod of study and considered them as martyrs to huge vo∣lumes of reports and statutes at large my pupils will be in no danger of these misfortunes It is recorded of an emi∣nent counsellor of the  North  family who being one of the ablest practitioners at the bar was so overloaded with business that sometimes chusing to retire awhile from hurry and per∣plexity he would say to his clerk  "Tell the people I do not practise this term"  This proper relaxation I always recommend to my pupils and have some reason to think they are prudent enough to embrace it for as I am ac∣quainted with several students on the new plan and do not remember to have seen them doing any business in the courts for some time I suppose they had given notice to their clerks  "to tell the people that they did not practise in those terms"  I am sir your humble servant IGNORAMUS  The Letter signed J C has been received and shall be duly regarded  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXXXIV THURSDAY  August    HOM  Mr VILLAGE to Mr TOWN  Dear Cousin  T  HE country at present no less than the metropolis abounding with politicians of every kind I begun to despair of picking up any intelligence that might possibly be entertaining to your readers However I have made a tour to some of the most distant parts of the kingdom with a clergy∣man of my acquaintance and shall not trouble you with an account of the improvements that have been made in the seats we saw according to the modern taste but pro∣ceed  to give you some reflections which occurred to us on observing several country churches and the behaviour of their congregations  THE ruinous condition of some of these churches gave me great offence and I could not help wishing that the honest vicar instead of indulging his genius for im∣provements by inclosing his gooseberry bushes with a  Chinese  rail and converting half an acre of his glebeland into a bowlinggreen would have applied part of his in∣come to the more laudable purpose of sheltering his pa∣rishioners from the weather during their attendance on divine service It is no uncommon thing to see the par∣sonag house well thatched and in exceeding good re∣pair while the church perhaps has no better roof than the ivy that grows over it The noise of owls bats and magpies makes a principal part of the church musick in many of these ancient edifices and the walls like a large map seem to be portioned out into capes seas and pro∣montories by the various colours with which the damps have stained them Sometimes it has happened that the foundation being too weak to support the steeple any longer it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building and to hang the bells under a wooden shed on the ground beside it This is the case in a parish in  Norfolk  through which I lately passed and where the clerk and the sexton like the two figures at St  Dun∣stan  's serve the bells in capacity of clappers by striking them alternately with a hammer  IN other churches I have observed that nothing un∣seemly or ruinous is to be found except in the clergyman and in the appendages of his person The squire of the pa∣rish  or his ancestors perhaps to testify their devotion and leave a lasting monument of their magnificence have adorned the altarpiece with the richest crimson velvet embroidered with vineleaves and ears of wheat and have dressed up the pulpit with the same splendour and expence while the gentleman who fills it is exalted in the midst of all this finery with a surplice as dirty as a farmer's frock and a periwig that seems to have trans∣ferred its faculty of curling to the band that appears in fullbuckle beneath it  BUT if I was concerned to see many of our country churches in a tottering condition I was more offended with the indecency of worship in others I could wish that the pastors would inform their hearers that there is no occasion to scream themselves hoarse in making the responses that the towncryer is not the only person qualified to pray with due devotion and that he who bawls the loudest may nevertheless be the wickedest fellow in the parish The old women too in the ayle might be told that their time would be better employed in attending to the sermon than in fumbling over their tattered testaments till they have found the text by which time the discourse is near drawing to a conclu∣sion while a word or two of instruction might not be thrown away upon the younger part of the congregation to teach them that making posies in summertime and cracking nuts in autumn is no part of the religious ceremony  THE good old practice of psalmsinging is indeed wonderfully improved in many country churches since the days of  Sternhold  and  Hopkins  and there is scarce a  parishclerk who has so little taste as not to pick his staves out of the New Version This has occasioned great complaints in some places where the clerk has been forced to bawl by himself because the rest of the congregation cannot find the psalm at the end of their prayerbooks while others are highly disgusted at the innovation and stick as obstinately to the Old Version as to the Old Stile The tunes themselves have also been newset to jiggish measures and the sober drawl which used to accompany the two first staves of the hundredth psalm with the  gloria patri  is now split into as many quavers as an  Italian  air For this purpose there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal musicians who make it their business to go round to all the churches in their turns and after a prelude with the pitchpipe astonish the audience with hymns set to the new  Win∣chester  measure and anthems of their own composing As these newfashioned psalmodists are necessarily made up of young men and maids we may naturally suppose that there is a perfect concord and symphony between them and indeed I have known it happen that these sweet singers have been brought more than once into disgrace by too close an unison between the thoroughbase and the treble  IT is a difficult matter to decide which is looked upon to be the greatest man in a country church the parson or his clerk The latter is most certainly held in higher veneration where the former happens to be only a poor curate who rides post every sabbath from village to village and mounts and dismounts at the churchdoor The clerk's office is not only to tag the prayers with an  Amen  or usher in the sermon with a stave but he is also the universal  father to give away the brides and the standing god∣father to all the newborn brats But in many places there is a still greater man belonging to the church than either the parson or the clerk himself The person I mean is the squire who like the King may be stiled Head of the Church in his own parish If the benefice be in his own gift the vicar is his creature and of con∣sequence entirely at his devotion or if the care of the church is left to a curate the Sunday fees of roast beef and plumb pudding and a liberty to shoot in the manor will bring him as much under the squire's command as his dogs and horses For this reason the bell is often kept tolling and the people waiting in the churchyard an hour longer than the usual time nor must the service begin till the squire has strutted up the ayle and seated himself in the great pew in the chancel The length of the sermon is also measured by the will of the squire as formerly by the hourglass and I know one parish where the preacher has always the complaisance to break off to a conclusion the minute that the squire gives the signal by rising up after his nap  IN a village church the squire's lady or the vicar's wife are perhaps the only females that are stared at for their finery but in the larger cities and towns where the newest fashions are brought down weekly by the stagecoach or waggon all the wives and daughters of the most topping tradesmen vie with each other every Sunday in the elegance of their apparel I could even trace the gradations in their dress according to the opu∣lence the extent and the distance of the place from  London  I was at church in a populous city in the north where the macebearer cleared the way for Mrs Mayoress  who came sidling after him in an enormous fanhoop of a pattern which had never been seen before in those parts At another church in a corporationtown I saw several Negligeès with furbelow'd aprons which had long dis∣puted the prize of superiority but these were most woe∣fully eclipsed by a burgess's daughter just come from  London  who appeared in a Trolloppeè or Slammerkin with treble ruffles to the cuffs pinked and gymped and the sides of the petticoat drawn up in festoons In some lesser borough towns the contest I found lay between three or four black and green bibs and aprons at one a grocer's wife attracted our eyes by a newfashioned cap called a Joan and at another they were wholly taken up by a mercer's daughter in a Nun's Hood  I NEED not say any thing of the behaviour of the con∣gregations in these more polite places of religious resort as the same genteel ceremonies are practised there as at the most fashionable churches at the court end of the town The ladies immediately on their entrance breathe a pious ejaculation through their fansticks and the beaus very gravely address themselves to the Haberdashers' Bills glewed upon the linings of their hats This pious duty is no sooner performed than the exercise of bowing and curtsying succeeds the locking and unlocking of the pews drowns the reader's voice at the beginning of the service and the rustling of silks added to the whispering and tittering of so much good company renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it  I am dear Cousin yours  c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and

and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXXXVI THURSDAY  September    Hominem pagina nostra sapit  MART  W  E whose business it is to write loose essays and who never talk above a quarter of an hour together on any one subject are not expected to enter into philosophical disquisitions or en∣gage in abstract speculations but it is supposed to be our principal aim to amuse and instruct the reader by a lively representation of what passes round about him Thus like those painters who delineate the  scenes of familiar life we sometimes give a sketch of a Marriage  à là mode  sometimes draw the outlines of a Modern Midnight conversation at another time paint the comical distresses of itinerant Tragedians in a barn and at another give a full draught of the Rake's or Harlot's progress Sometimes we divert the public by exhibiting single portraits and when we meet with a subject where the features are strongly marked by nature and there is something peculiarly characteristic in the whole manner we employ ourselves in drawing a full length In a word we consider all mankind as sitting for their pictures and endeavour to work up our pieces with lively traits and embellish them with beautiful colouring and though perhaps they are not always highly finished yet they seldom fail of pleasing some few at least of the vast multitude of Critics and Con∣noisseurs if we are so happy as to hit off a striking likeness  THERE is perhaps no knowledge more requisite and certainly none at present more ardently sought after than the Knowledge of the World In this science we are more particularly expected to be adepts as well as to ini∣tiate or at least improve our readers in it And though this knowledge cannot be collected altogether from books yet as  Pope  says  "Men may be read as well as books too much"  and it is to be lamented that many who have only consulted the volume of life as it lay open be∣fore them have rather become worse than better by their studies They who have lived wholly in the world  without regarding the comments on it are generally taint∣ed with all its vices to which the gathering part of their instructions from books would perhaps have proved an antidote There indeed though they would have seen the faults and foibles of mankind fairly represented yet vice would appear in an odious and virtue in an amiable light but those who unwarned go abroad into the world are often dazzled by the splendor with which wealth gilds vice and infamy and being accustomed to see bare∣foot honesty treated with scorn are themselves induced to consider it as contemptible For this reason I am a good deal offended at the ingenious contrivance of our modern novellists and writers of comedy who often gloss over a villainous character with the same false varnish that lackers so many scoundrels in real life and while they are exhibiting a fellow who debauches your daugh∣ter or lies with your wife represent him as an agreeable creature a man of gallantry and a fine gentleman  THE world even the gayest part of it may be paint∣ed like itself and yet become a lesson of instruction The pieces of  Hogarth  to recur to the illustration I first made use of are faithful delineations of certain scenes of life and yet vice and folly always appear odious and contem∣ptible I could wish it were possible to learn the know∣ledge of the world without being  "hackney'd in the ways of men"  but as that is impracticable it is still our duty so to live in it as to avoid being corrupted by our intercourse with mankind We should endeavour to guard against fraud without becoming ourselves deceit∣ful  and to see every species of vice and folly practised round about us without growing knaves and fools The villainy of others is but a poor excuse for the loss of our own integrity and though indeed if I am attacked on  HounslowHeath  I may lawfully kill the highwayman in my own defence yet I should be very deservedly brought to the gallows if I took a purse from the next person I met because I had been robbed myself  THE Knowledge of the World as it is generally un∣derstood consists not so much in a due reflection on its vices and follies as in the practice of them and those who consider themselves as best acquainted with it are either the dupes of fashion or slaves of interest It is al∣so supposed to lie within the narrow compass of every man's own sphere of life and receives a different interpre∣tation in different stations Thus for instance the man of fashion seeks it nowhere but in the polite circle of the  beaumonde  while the man of business looks no farther for it than the  Alley  I shall beg leave to illustrate this by two characters each of whom though diametrically op∣posite to the other has acquired a thorough Knowledge of the World  SIR  Harry Flash  had the good luck to be born be∣fore his brother  Richard  consequently the heir to the estate was bred a gentleman and the other condemned to plod in the dull drudgery of business The merchant was sent to learn accompts at the Academy upon  TowerHill  and the baronet had the finishing of his education in  France  Sir  Harry  is now a most accomplished fine gentleman is an excellent judge of fashions and can cal∣culate the odds at any game as readily as  Hoyle  or  De∣moivre  the Alderman is the most knowing man upon  'Change  and understands the rise and fall of Stocks bet∣ter than any  Jew  Both of them know the world but with this difference that one by his consummate know∣ledge has run out a large estate while the other has raised a plumb by it  BEFORE I conclude it will be proper to take notice of the great improvements made by our modern ladies in this part of their education The pretty creatures were formerly kept at home and employed in the domestic cares of good housewifery they were taught as much as possible to shun the company of the men and knew no more of the world than a cloistered Nun But these restraints are now happily removed by the present mode of education The little lady instead of being sent to the boardingschool to learn needlework is introduced to the politest routs and assemblies and taught to make one at the cardtable she is carried about to  Vauxhall Rane∣lagh  and other genteel places of amusement and besides these if we add a trip to  Bath  or  Cheltenham  there is no doubt but she is completely versed in the Knowledge of the World This we must own is very necessary to be attained by ladies of fashion but it is with great concern that I have observed the inferior rank of females fre∣quenting the same schools and learning the same lessons Some have purchased their knowledge very dearly at the  expence of their reputation while others have laid out their whole fortunes to acquire it and I could not but smile the other day at reading an advertisement in the public papers begging our charity for a poor distressed gentlewoman who had formerly lived well and seen a great deal of the World  Just Published  In Two Neat Pocket Volumes Price Six Shillings bound  The CONNOISSEUR revised and corrected  With a new Translation of the  Mottos  and  Quotations  THE CONNOISSEUR

it"  says Sir  John Brute  But if he had been joined to such an  Epicurean  consort as I those expressions that favour of the kitchen would have been real instead of metaphorical We live in a land really flowing with milk and honey and keep a house of entertainment for all comers and goers We  hardly ever sit down to table less in number than twenty or thirty and very often to above double that number of dishes In short sir so much feasting has given me a surfeit  THERE are I see scattered up and down your pa∣pers several accounts of the petty distresses and domestic concerns of private families As you have listened to many complaints from husbands I flatter myself you will not refuse your attention to the humble remonstrance of a wife being assured that my only reason for thus serv∣ing up my dear lord as a new dish to gratify the public taste is to check if possible his violent passion for give∣ing his friends entertainments of another kind which if indulged much longer must eat us out of house and home  THE magnificent feasts of  Timon  of  Athens  or the sto∣ries of old  English  Hospitality would give you but a faint idea of the perpetual riot and luxury of our family Our house is always stored with as large a quantity of provisi∣ons as a garrison in expectation of a siege and those too of the dearest and most extravagant kind Ortolans and woodcocks are as plenty as sparrows and red mullets are scarce a greater rarity with us than gudgeons or sprats while turtle and venison are regarded as branches of ci∣tizenluxury which scarce deserve notice among the ma∣ny other delicacies in which we abound Authors they say you will pardon me Mr TOWN are seldom ad∣mitted to great entertainments and I can assure you that it is not easy for any but those who are present to conceive the parade and extravagance displayed in our house I myself am condemned to sit at the head of the  table while my lord is placed at the other end in pain and uneasiness at my aukward mistakes in  doing the ho∣nours  You must know sir that I was bred up under an housewifely aunt in the country who taught me to pickle and preserve and gave me as I thought a tole∣rable notion of cookery But alas though I under∣stand plain boiled and roast and have a very good notion of a pudding I am often totally ignorant of the names and compositions of the delicacies before me and have imagined fish to be fowl and mistaken a  petit pateè  for a plebeian mincepie In the mean time my lord is dis∣playing his exquisite taste by deciding upon every dish and pronouncing with a critical smack upon the flavour of the wines all the while not a little solicitous about the exactness of the Removes and the duly adjusting the  entremets  Claret Burgundy and Champagne are as common as ale or smallbeer and even Hermitage and Tokay are swallowed with as little remorse as Port of Lis∣bon To add to all this is most absurdly introduced the  French  custom of serving in  les Liqueurs  which consist of almost as many sorts as are contained in the advertisements from the Rich Cordial Warehouse In a word every common dinner with us is a feast and when we have what my lord calls an entertainment it is an absolute de∣bauch  BUT there is no part of this monstrous expence af∣fects me so much as the vast sums ridiculously lavished on a Desert This piece of folly and extravagance could be nothing but the joint product of a  Frenchman  and a con∣fectioner After the gratification of the appetite with more substantial fare this whiptsyllabub rareeshew is served up chiefly to feed the eye not but that the mate∣rials  of which the Desert is composed are as expensive as the several ingredients in the dinner and I will leave you to your own method of rating the rest after telling you that my lord thinks himself an excellent oecono∣mist by having reduced the expence of the HotHouse to a thousand  per ann  which perhaps the admirers of exotic fruits will not think dear as we have pineapples as plenty as goldenpippins or nonpareils  ONE would think that the first requisite in eating was extravagance and that in order to have any thing very good it must be eat at a time that it is out of season Therefore one of the principal uses of our HotHouse is to invert the order of nature and to turn winter into summer We should be ashamed to see peas upon our table while they are to be had at a common market but we never spare any cost to provide a good crop by the assistance of our hotbeds at  Christmas  We have no relish for cucumbers during the summer months when they are no rarity but we take care to have them forced in  November  But my lord mostly prides himself on the improvements that he has made in his MushroomBeds which he has at length brought to so great perfection that by the help of horsedung and throwing artificial sunbeams through a burningglass we can raise any quantity of Mushrooms of the right  Italian  kind at two hours warning  FROM the HotHouse we may make a very natural transition to the Kitchen and as in the former every thing must be produced out of season so every thing in the latter must undergo a strange metamorphosis The ordinary distinctions of fish flesh and fowl are quite  destroyed and nothing comes upon table under its proper form and appellation It is impossible to conceive what vast sums are melted down into sauces We have a cargo of hams every year from  Westphalia  only to ex∣tract the  Essence  of them for our soups and we kill a brace of bucks every week to make a  Cullis  of the haunches Half a dozen turkies have been killed in one day merely for the sake of the pinions and I have known a whole pond dragged to furnish a dish of Carps' Palates and ten legs of mutton mangled raw to make out a dish of Pope's Eyes  THE concomitant charges of the cellar you will ima∣gine are no less extravagant and indeed it is not enough that we abound in the best  French  and  Italian  wines which by the bye are purchased on the spot at an extraordinary price but we must have several other kinds of the highest value and consequently a most delicious flavour And though but a taste of each has been sipped round by the company the same bottles must never be brought a second time upon table but are secured as perquisites by the butler who fells them to the merchant who sells them back again to my lord Besides these his lordship has lately been at an immense charge in raising a Pinery in order to try the experiment of making Cyder of Pineapples which he hopes to do at little more than treble the expence of Champagne To this article I might also add the charge of his IceHouses for although these are stored with an homecommodity originally of no value yet I may  to say that every drop of water comes as dear to us as the most costly of our wines  AS all our liquors I have told you are of foreign growth and all our dishes distinguished by foreign titles you will readily conceive that our houshold is chiefly composed of foreigners The butler out of livery and his two underbutlers are  Frenchmen  the clerk of the kitchen is a  Frenchman  and  Monsieur Fri∣cando  the headcook to be sure is a  Frenchman  This gentleman never soils his fingers in touching the least bit of any thing but gives his orders like a general to four subalterns who are likewise  Frenchmen  The baker the confectioner the very scullions and even the fellow that looks after the poultry are all of them  Frenchmen  These you may be sure are maintained at very high salaries and though  Monsieur Fricando  had the pay of a captain in a marching regiment my lord was forced to double his wages at the beginning of the war and allow him the free exercise of his  religion  to prevent his leaving the kingdom  I AM sorry to add that this pride of keeping a table has visibly impaired my lord's fortunes and this very summer he has been obliged to fell all the timber on his estate as I may say to keep up his kitchen fire The only satisfaction he can possibly reap from all this ex∣pence is the vanity of having it said  "that nobody treats so elegantly as his lordship"  and now and then perhaps reading in the newspapers  "that such a day the right honourable gave a grand entertainment at his house in at which were present the prin∣cipal Officers of State and Foreign Ministers"  I am SIR Your humble servant  c  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXXXVIII THURSDAY  September    Servatâ semper lege et ratione loquendi  JUV  I  N the comedy of the  Frenchman in Lon∣don  which we are told was acted at  Paris  with universal applause for several nights together there is a character of a rough  Englishman  who is represented as quite unskilled in the graces of conversation and his dialogue is made up of almost nothing but a repetition of the common salutation of  how do you do how do you do  Our nation has indeed been generally supposed to be of a sullen and uncommunicative disposition while on  the other hand the loquacious  French  have been allowed to possess the art of conversing beyond all other people The  Englishman  requires to be wound up frequently and stops as soon as he is down but the  Frenchman  runs on in a continued alarum Yet it must be acknow∣ledged that as the  English  consist of very different hu∣mours their manner of discourse admits of great variety but the whole  French  nation converse alike and there is no difference in their address between a  Marquis  and a  Valet de Chambre  We may frequently see a couple of  French  barbers accosting each other in the street and paying their compliments with the same volubility of speech and grimace of action as two courtiers in the  Thuilleries  I SHALL not attempt to lay down any particular rules for conversation but point out such faults in the discourse and behaviour as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amusing It is in vain indeed to look for conversation where we might expect to find it in the greatest perfection among persons of fashion where it is almost annihilated by universal cardplaying insomuch that I have heard it given as a reason why it is impossible for our present writers to succeed in the dialogue of genteel comedy that our people of quality scarce ever meet but to game All their discourse turns upon the odd trick and the four honours and it is no less a maxim with the votaries of Whist than with those of  Bacchus  that talking spoils company Every one endeavours to make himself as agreeable to society as he can but it often happens that those who most aim at shining in conversation overshoot their mark and though a man succeeds he should not as is frequently  the case engross the whole talk to himself for that destroys the very essence of conversation which is talk∣ing together We should try to keep up conversation like a ball bandied to and fro from one to the other rather than seize it all to ourselves and drive it before us like a football We should likewise be cautious to adapt the matter of our discourse to our company and not talk  Greek  before the ladies or of the last new furbelow to a meeting of country justices  THE pests and nuisances of society which are com∣monly to be met with may be ranged in the following manner And first the Attitudinarians and Facemakers These accompany every word with a peculiar grimace or gesture they assent with a shrug and contradict with a twisting of the neck are angry with a wry mouth and pleased in a caper or a minuet step They may be considered as speaking Harlequins and their rules of eloquence are taken from the posturemaster These should be condemned to converse only in dumb shew with their own persons in the lookingglass as also the Smirkers and Smilers who so prettily set off their faces together with their words by a  je ne sçai quoi  between a grin and a dimple With these we may likewise rank the affected tribe of Mimics who are constantly taking off the peculiar tone of voice or gesture of their ac∣quaintance though they  "imitate humanity so abomi∣nably"  that like bad painters they are frequently forced to write the name under the picture before we can discover any likeness  NEXT to these whose elocution consists chiefly in the action we may consider the profest speakers And first  of the Emphatical who squeeze and press and beat down every syllable with as much vehemence as a paviour thumps the pebbles with his rammer These energetic orators are remarkable for the force of expression with which they utter the particle  the  and conjunctive  and  which they seem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their own throats and to cram them with no less pain in∣to the ears of their auditors These should be suffered only to syringe as it were the ears of a deaf man through an hearing trumpet and with these we may join the Whisperers or Low Speakers who come up so close to you that they may be said to measure noses with you and have frequently a stinking breath I would have these oracular gentry obliged to talk at a distance through a speaking trumpet or apply their lips to the walls of a whispering gallery The Wits who will not condescend to utter any thing but a  bon mot  and the Whistlers or Tunehummers who never articulate at all may be joined very agreeably together in concert and to these tinkling cymbals I would also add the sounding brass the Bawler who inquires after your health with the bellowing of a towncryer  THE Tatlers whose pliable pipes are admirably adapt∣ed to the  "soft parts of conversation"  and sweetly  "prattling out of fashion"  make very pretty musick from a beautiful face and a female tongue but from a rough manly voice and coarse features it is as harsh and dissonant as a jig from a bagpipe The HalfSwearers who split and mince and fritter their oaths into  gad's bud ad's fish  and  demmee  and the Humbuggers and those who nickname God's creatures who call a man a cab∣bage a crab a queer cub an odd fish and an unac∣countable  muskin should never come into company with∣out an interpeter But I shall not tire my reader's pa∣tience by pointing out others no less destructive of so∣ciety such as the Sensibles who pronounce dogmatical∣ly on the most trivial points and speak in sentences the Wonderers who are always  wondering  what o'clock it is or  wondering  whether it will rain or no or  wondering  when the moon changes and lastly the Silent Men who seem afraid of opening their mouths for fear of catch∣ing cold and literally observe the precept of the gospel by letting their conversation be only  yea yea  and  nay nay  THE rational intercourse which is mutually kept up among men by conversing with each other is one of our principal distinctions from brutes and it is imagined by some philosophers that birds and beasts though with∣out the power of articulation perfectly understand one another by the sounds they utter and that dogs cats  c  have each a particular language to themselves like different nations Thus it may be supposed that the nightingales of  Italy  have as fine an ear for their own na∣tive woodnotes as any  Signor  or  Signora  for an  Italian Air  that the boars of  Westphalia  gruntle as expressively through the nose as the inhabitants in  HighGerman  and that the frogs in the dykes of  Holland  croak as intelligibly as the natives jabber their  HighDutch  However this may be we may consider those who let their tongues always vibrate as their hearts beat and do not keep up the proper conversation of human creatures as imitating the language of different animals Thus for instance the affinity between Chatterers and Monkeys and Praters and Parrots is too obvious not to occur at once Grunters  and Growlers may be justly compared to Hogs Snarlers are Curs that continually shew their teeth but never bite and the Spitfire Passionate are a sort of wild Cats that will not bear stroaking but will purr when they are pleased Complainers are ScriechOwls and Storytel∣lers who are always repeating the same dull note are Cuckows Poets that prick up their ears at their own hideous braying are no better than Asses Critics in gene∣ral are venomous serpents that delight in hissing and some of them who have got by heart a few technical terms without knowing their meaning are no other than Magpies I myself who have crowed to the whole town for near three years past may perhaps put my readers in mind of a Dunghill Cock but as I must acquaint them that they will hear the last of me on this day fortnight I hope they will then consider me as a Swan who is supposed to sing sweetly at his dying moments  Just Published  In Two Neat Pocket Volumes Price Six Shillings bound  The

DEAR COUSIN  IT was not without some regret that I received advice of your intentions to bid adieu to the public for as you had been so kind as to introduce me to their notice I began to indulge all the weakness and vanity of a young author and had almost persuaded myself that I was the principal support of your papers Conscious of my own importance I expect that you will do me the justice to acknowledge how much you are indebted to the as∣sistance  of your very ingenious Cousin and I care not how many compliments you pay me on my wit and learning but at the same time I must beg leave to put in a caveat against your disposing of me in what manner you yourself please Writers of essays think themselves at liberty to do what they will with the characters they have introduced into their works as writers of tragedy in order to heighten the plot have brought their heroes to an untimely end when they have died quietly many years before in their beds or as our chroniclers of daily occurrences put a duke to death give away an heiress in marriage or shoot off an admiral's legs whenever they please Mr ADDISON while he was carrying on the SPECTATOR said  "he would kill Sir  Roger de Coverly  that nobody else might murder him"  In like manner my dear Cousin you may perhaps take it into your head to cut me off you may make an end of me by a cold caught in partridgeshooting or break my neck in a stag∣hunt Or you may rather chuse to settle me perhaps with a rich old country dowager or press me into the army or clap me on board of a man of war But I desire that you will not get rid of me by any of these means but permit me to assure your readers that I am alive and merry and this is to let them know that I am in good health at this present writing  YOUR papers I assure you have made a great noise in the country and the most intelligent among us read you with as much satisfaction as the  Evening Posts  or the  Weekly Journals  I know more than one squire who who takes them in constantly with the  Magazines  and I was told by the postmaster of a certain town that they came down every week under cover to the but∣ler of a member of parliament There is a club of country parsons who meet every  Saturday  at a neigh∣bouring markettown to be shaved and exchange ser∣mons they have a subscription for books and pamphlets and the only periodical works ordered in by them are  the  Connoisseur  and the  Critical  and  Monthly Reviews  I was lately introduced to this society when the conver∣sation happened to turn upon Mr TOWN A young curate just come from  Oxford  said he knew you very well at  Christ Church  and that you was a comical dog but a  Cantab  declared no less positively that you was either a pensioner of  Trinity  or a commoner of  Bennet  's People indeed are very much perplexed about the real author some affirm that you are a nobleman and others will have it that you are an actor some say you are a young lawyer some a parson and some an old woman  THE subjects of your papers have often been wrested to various interpretations by our penetrating geniusses and you have hardly drawn a character that has not been fixed on one or other of the greatest personages in the nation I once heard a country justice express his won∣der that you was not taken up and set in the pillory and I myself by some of my rural intelligence have brought upon you the resentment of several honest squires who long to horsewhip the scoundrel for putting them in print Others again are quite at a loss how to pick out your meaning and in vain turn over their  Bailey  's dictio∣nary for an explanation of several fashionable phrases which though they have enriched the townlanguage have not yet made their way into the dialect of the coun∣try Many exquisite strokes of humour are also lost upon us on account of our distance from the scene of action and the wit which is very brisk and lively upon the spot loses much of its spirit in the carriage and sometimes wholly evaporates in the postbag  YOU moralists are very apt to flatter yourselves that you are doing a vast deal of good by your labours but whatever reformation you may have worked in town give me leave to tell you that you have sometimes done us harm in the country by the bare mention of the vices  and follies now in vogue From your intelligence some of our most polite ladies have learned that it is highly genteel to have a route and some have copied the fashion so exactly as to play at cards on  Sundays  Your papers upon dress set all our belles at work in following the mode you no sooner took notice of the cocked hats but every hat in the parish was turned up behind and be∣fore and when you told us that the townbeauties went naked our rural damsels immediately began to throw off their cloaths Our gentlemen have been also taught by you all the new arts of betting and gaming and the only coffeehouse in one little town where the most topping inhabitants are used to meet to play at draughts and backgammon has from the great increase of gamesters who resort to it been elegantly christened by the name of  White  's  AS to the small share which I myself have had in your work you may be sure every body here is hugely delighted with it at least you may be sure that I will say nothing to the contrary I have done my best to contribute to the entertainment of your readers and as the name of  Steele  is not forgot in the SPECTATOR though  Addison  has run away with almost all the honour I am in hopes that whenever the great Mr TOWN is mentioned they may possibly think at the same time on  Your affectionate Cousin and Coadjutor VILLAGE  AFTER this account which my Cousin has sent me of the reception I have met with in the country it will be proper to say something of my reception here in town I shall therefore consider myself in the threefold capacity of CONNOISSEUR CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL As a CONNOISSEUR in the confined sense of the word I must own I have met with several mortifications I have neither been made F R S nor even a member of the Academy of  Bourdeaux  or  Petersburgh  They have left  me out of the list of Trustees to the  British Musaeum  and his Majesty of  Naples  though he presented an "Account of the Curiosities found in  Herculaneum  " to each of the universities never sent one to me I have not been celebrated in the Philosophical Transactions or in any of our Magazines of Arts and Sciences nor have I been stiled  tresillustre  or  tressçavant  in any of the fo∣reign  Mercures  or  Journals Literaires  Once indeed I soothed myself in the vain thought of having been distin∣guished by the great  Swedish  Botanist  Linnaeus  under the title of  Eruditissimus Urbanus  which I conceited to be the name of TOWN latinized but to my great disap∣pointment I afterwards discovered that this was no other than the learned Naturalist Mr  Silvanus Urban  author of the  Gentleman's Magazine  This neglect of me as a CONNOISSEUR I can attribute to no other cause than to my not having made myself known by my  Musaeum  or Cabinet of Curiosities and to say the truth I am not worth a farthing in antique coins nor have I so much as one single shell or butterfly All my complaints against the modern innovations of Taste have been therefore disregarded and with concern I still see the Villas of our citizens fantastically adorned with  Chinese  palings and our streets encumbered with superb colonnades porticos  Gothic  arches and  Venetian  windows before the shops of our tradesmen  NOR have I as a CRITIC met with greater success or encouragement in my endeavours to reform the pre∣sent Taste in literature I expected to have the priviledge of eating beef  gratis  every night at  Vauxhall  for advising the gardenpoets to put a little meaning into their songs but though I was there several nights this summer I could not say with  Cassio  of any of their productions  "this is a more exquisite song than t'other"  I have not been able to write the operas out of the kingdom and though I have more than once shewed my contempt for Harlequin I am assured there are no less than three  Pantomimes to be brought on this season As I set my∣self up for supreme judge in theatrical matters I was in hopes that my Lord Chamberlain would at least ap∣pointed me his DeputyLicenser but he has not even consult me on any one new play I made no doubt but the managers would pay their court to me but they have not once sent for me to dinner and so far from having the freedom of the house I declare I have not had so much as a single order from any of the underactors  IN my office of CENSORGENERAL though I cannot boast of having overturned the cardtables at routs and assemblies or broke up the club at  Arthur  's I can safely boast that I have routed the manyheaded monster at the Disputant Society at the  Robinhood  and put to silence the great  Claremarket  Orator In a word I have la∣boured to prevent the growth of vice and immorality and with as much effect as the Justices at the Quartersessions For this reason I expected to have been put into commission and to have had the power of licensing all places of public diversion vested solely in my hands But as I find my merits have been hitherto overlooked I am determined to lay down my office and in my next num∣ber I shall take my final leave of the public when I shall give them an account or my correspondents together with a full and particular account of MYSELF  Preparing for the Press  And will be published with all convenient Expedition  The THIRD and FOURTH VOLUMES of  The CONNOISSEUR in Twelves  Which will complete the Work Corrected and improved  With a new Translation of the Mottos and a copious Table of Con∣tents as in the First and Second Volumes already published  THE CONNOISSEUR By Mr  TOWN  CRITIC and CENSORGENERAL  NUMBER CXL THURSDAY  September    Nos DUO turba sumus  OVID  Pene gemelli  Fraternis Animis  HOR  P  ERIODICAL writers who retail their sense or nonsense to the world sheet by sheet acquire a sort of familiarity and intimacy with the public peculiar to themselves Had the  Th  se Two Volumes in  will make Four in  Duodecimo  the Two  which are already published and the Third and Fourth preparing for the press  Two Volumes in  Folio  which have swelled by degrees to their present bulk burst forth at once Mr TOWN must have introduced himself to the acquaintance of the public with the aukward air and distance of a stranger but be now flatters himself that they will look upon him as an old companion whose  conversation they are pleased with and as they will see him no more after this time will now and then perhaps miss their usual visiter  HOWEVER this may be the Authors of the CON∣NOISSEUR now think proper to close the undertaking in which they have been engaged for near three years past and among their general thanks to the indulgent readers of their papers they must include in a particular manner their acknowledgments to those who have been pleased to appear in them as writers They have there∣fore at the close of their work brought Mr TOWN and all his associates on the scene together like the  dra∣matis personae  at the end of the last act  OUR earliest and most frequent correspondent is only known to us by the initials G K and we are sorry that he will not put it in our power to mention his name which if we are not mistaken in our guess would reflect as much credit on our work as we are sure will redound to it from his contributions To him we are proud to own ourselves indebted for most part of N  o  and for the letter signed  Goliah English  in N  o  for a great part of N  o  and and for the letters signed  Reginald Fitzworm Michael Krawbidge Moses Orthodox  and  T Vainall  in N  o  and  THE next in priority of time is a gentleman of  Cam∣bridge  who signed himself A B and we cannot but re∣gret that he withdrew his assistance after having obliged us with the best part of the letters in N  o  and and of the essays in N  o  and  THE letters in N  o  and came from various hands equally unknown to us The Imi∣tation of  Horace  in N  o  was written as we are in∣formed by a gentleman of  Oxford  the Ode to Friend∣ship in N  o  was sent to us by a gentleman of  Cam∣bridge  and from two other gentlemen of that University we received the letter signed  W Manly  in N  o  and another signed B A in N  o    THESE unexpected marks of favour conferred on us by strangers demand our highest gratitude but we are no less happy in being able to boast of the assistance of some other gentlemen whom we are proud to call friends though we are not at liberty to introduce them to the acquaintance of our readers From a friend en∣gaged in the Law we had the first sketches and most striking passages in N  o  and though it may be regretted by the public as well as ourselves that his leisure would not permit him to put the finishing hand to them From a friend a gentleman of the  Temple  we received N  o  and To a friend a member of  Trinity College Cambridge  we are indebted for the Song in N  o  and the Verses in N  o  and The list of contributions from such capable friends would doubtless have been much larger had they been sooner let into the secret but as Mr TOWN like a great prince chose to appear  incog  in order to avoid the impertinence of others he did not even make himself known to those about his person till at last they themselves found him out through his disguise  THERE are still remaining two correspondents who must stand by themselves as they have wrote to us not in an assumed character but  in propriâ personâ  The first is no less a personage than the great Orator HENLY who obliged us with that truly original letter printed in N  o  The other who favoured us with a letter no less original in N  o  we have reason to be∣lieve is a Methodist Teacher and a mechanic but we do not know either his name or his trade  WE now come to the most important discovery of Ourselves and to answer the oftenrepeated question of  Who is Mr  TOWN it being the custom for periodical writers at the same time that they send the hawkers abroad with their last dying speech like the malefactors like them also to couple it with a confession The general method of unravelling this mystery is by de∣claring to whom the different signatures affixed to dif∣ferent papers are appropriated For ever since the days of the inimitable SPECTATOR it has been usual for a  bold Capital to stand like a sentry at the end of our essays to guard the author in secresy and it is com∣monly supposed that the writer who does not chuse to put his name to his work has in this manner like the painters and statuaries of old at least set his mark But the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR now confess that the several letters at first pitched upon to bring up the rear of their essays have been annexed to different papers at random and sometimes omitted on purpose to put the sagacious reader on a wrong scent It is particularly the interest of a writer who prints himself out week by week to remain unknown during the course of this piecemeal publication The best method therefore to prevent a discovery is to make the road to it as intricate as possible and instead of seeming to aim at keeping the reader entirely in the dark to hang out a kind of wan∣dering light which only serves to lead him astray The desire of giving each writer his due according to the signatures has in the course of this undertaking often confused the curious in their inquiries Soon after the publication of our first papers some ingenious gentlemen found out that T O W N being the letters that form∣ed the name of TOWN there were four authors each of whom sheltered himself under a particular letter but no paper ever appearing with an N affixed to it they were obliged to give up this notion But if they had been more able decypherers they would have made out that though T O W will not compose the name of TOWN yet by a different arrangement of the letters it will form the word TWO which is the grand mystery of our signatures and couches under it the true and real number of the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR  HAVING thus declared Mr TOWN to consist of two separate individuals it will perhaps be expected that like two tradesmen who have agreed to dissolve their part∣nership we should exactly ballance our accounts and assign to each his due parcel of the stock But our ac∣counts are of so intricate a nature that it would be im∣possible for us to adjust them in that manner We have not only joined in the work taken altogether but almost every single paper is the joint product of both and as we have laboured equally in erecting the fabric we can∣not  pretend that any one particular part is the sole work∣manship of either An hint has perhaps been started by one of us improved by the other and still further heigh∣tened by an happy coalition of sentiment in both as fire is struck out by a mutual collision of flint and steel Sometimes like  Strada  's lovers conversing with the sym∣pathetic needles we have written papers together at fifty miles distance from each other the first rough draught or loose minutes of an essay have often travelled in the stagecoach from town to country and from country to town and we have frequently waited for the postman whom we expected to bring us the precious remainder of a CONNOISSEUR with the same anxiety as we should wait for the half of a bank note without which the other half would be of no value These our joint labours it may easily be imagined would have soon broke off ab∣ruptly if either had been too fondly attached to his own little conceits or if we had conversed together with the jealousy of a rival or the complaisance of a formal ac∣quaintance who smiles at every word that is said by his companion Nor could this work have been so long car∣ried on with so much chearfulness and goodhumour on both sides if the Two had not been as closely united as the two Students whom the SPECTATOR mentions as recorded by a  Terrae Filius  at  Oxford  "to have had but one mind one purse one chamber and one hat"  IT has been often remarked that the reader is very desirous of picking up some little particulars concerning the author of the book which he is perusing To gratify this passion many literary anecdotes have been publish∣ed and an account of their life character and behaviour has been prefixed to the works of our most celebrated writers Essayists are commonly expected to be their own Biographers and perhaps our readers may require some further intelligence concerning the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR But as they have all along ap∣peared as a sort of  Sofias  in literature they cannot now describe themselves any otherwise than as one and the same person and can only satisfy the curiosity of the pub∣lic by giving a short account of that respectable personage Mr TOWN considering him as of the plural or rather according to the  Grecians  of the dual number  Mr TOWN is a fair black middlesized very short man He wears his own hair and a perriwig He is about thirty years of age and not more than four and twenty He is a Student of the Law and a Batchelor of Physic He was bred at the University of  Oxford  where having taken no less than three degrees he looks down on many learned Professors his inferiors yet having been there but little longer than to take the first degree of Batchelor of Arts it has more than once happened that the CEN∣SORGENERAL of all  England  has been reprimanded by the Censor of his College for neglecting to furnish the usual Essay or in the collegiate phrase the Theme of the week  This joint description of ourselves will we hope sa∣tisfy the reader without any further information For our own parts we cannot but be pleased with having raised this monument of our mutual friendship and esteem and if these essays shall continue to be read when they will no longer make their appearance as the fugitive pieces of the week we shall be happy in con∣sidering that we are mentioned at the same time We have all the while gone on as it were hand in hand together and white we are both employed in furnishing matter for the paper now before us we cannot help smiling at our thus making our  exit  together like the two Kings of  Brentford  smelling at one nosegay  TWO  The End of the Second Volume  Preparing for the Press And will be published with all convenient Expedition The THIRD and FOURTH VOLUMES of The CONNOISSEUR in Twelves Which will complete the Work Corrected and improved With a new Translation of the Mottos and a copious Table of Con∣tents as in the First and Second Volumes already published
