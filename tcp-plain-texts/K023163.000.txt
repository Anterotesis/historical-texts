 Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable  RICHARD  Lord Viscount  COBHAM  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCXXXIV  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable  RICHARD  Lord Visc  t    COBHAM  _YES you despise the Man to Books confin'd  Who from his Study rails at human kind  Tho' what he learns he speaks and may advance  Some gen'ral Maxims or be right by Chance  The coxcomb Bird so talkative and grave  That from his Cage cries Cuckold Whore and Knave  Tho' many a Passenger he rightly call  You hold him no Philosopher at all  And yet the Fate of all Extremes is such  Men may be read as well as Books too much  To Observations which our selves we make  We grow more partial for th' Observer's sake  To written Wisdom as another's less  Maxims are drawn from Notions those from Guess  There's some  Peculiar  in each Leaf and Grain  Some unmark'd Fibre or some varying Vein  Shall only Man be taken in the gross  Grant but as many sorts of Mind as  There are above Sorts of Moss observed by Naturalists  Moss  That each from other differs first confess  Next that he varies from himself no less  Add Nature's Custom's Reason's Passion's strife  And all Opinion's Colours cast on Life  Yet more the Diff'rence is as great between  The Optics seeing as the Objects seen  All Manners take a tincture from our own  Or come discolour'd thro' our Passions shown  Or Fancy's beam inlarges multiplies  Contracts inverts and gives ten thousand dyes  Our Depths who fathoms or our Shallows finds  Quick Whir  s and shifting Eddies of our minds  Life's Stream for Observation will not stay  It hurries all too fast to mark their way  In vain sedate Reflections we would make  When half our Knowledge we must snatch not takeâ–ª  On human Actions reason tho' you can  It may be Reason but it is not Man  His Principle of Action once explore  That instant 'tis his Principle no more  Like following Life thro' Creatures you dissect  You lose it in the Moment you detect  Oft in the Passions wild rotation tost  Our Spring of Action to our selves is lost  Tir'd not determin'd to the last we yield  And what comes then is master of the field  As the last Image of that troubled heap  When sense subsides and fancy sports in sleep  Tho' past the recollection of the thought  Becomes the stuff of which our Dream is wrought  Something as dim to our internal view  Is thus perhaps the cause of all we do  In vain the grave with retrospective Eye  Would from th' apparent  what  conclude the  why  Infer the Motive from the Deed and show  That what we  chanc'd  was what we  meant  to do  Behold if Fortune or a Mistress frowns  Some plunge in bus'ness others shave their Crowns  To ease the Soul of one oppressive Weight  This quits an Empire that embroils a State  The same adust Complection has impell'd  CHARLES V PHILIP II  Charles  to the Convent  Philip  to the Field  Not always  Actions  shew the Man we find  Who does a Kindness is not therefore kind  Perhaps Prosperity becalm'd his Breast  Perhaps the Wind just shifted from the East  Not always humble he who seeks Retreat  Pride guides his Steps and bids him shun the Great  Who combats bravely is not therefore brave  He dreads a Deathbed like the meanest Slave  Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise  His pride in reas'ning not in acting lies  But grant that Actions best discover Man  Take the most  strong  and  sort  them as you can  The  few  that glare each Character must mark  You balance not the  many  in the dark  What will you do with such as disagree  Suppress them or miscal them Policy  Must then at once the Character to save  A plain rough Hero turn a crafty Knave  Alas in Truth the Man but chang'd his Mind  Perhaps was sick in Love or had not din'd  Ask how from  Britain Caesar  made retreat  Caesar  perhaps had told you he was beat  The mighty  Czar  what mov'd to wed a Punk  The mighty  Czar  might answer he was dunk  But sage Historians 'tis your task to prove  One action Conduct one Heroic Love  'Tis from  high Life  high Characters are drawn  A Saint in Crape is twice a Saint in Lawn  A Judge is just a Chanc'lor juster still  A Gownman learn'd a Bishop what you will  Wise if a Minister but if a King  More wise more learn'd more just more ev'ry thing  CourtVirtues bear like Gems the highest rate  Born where Heav'ns influence scarce can penetrate  In Life's low vale the soil the Virtues like  They please as Beauties here as Wonders strike  Tho' the same Sun with alldiffusive rays  Blush in the Rose and in the Diamond blaze  We prize the stronger effort of his Pow'r  And always set the Gem above the Flow'r  'Tis  Education  forms the vulgar mind  Just as the Twig is bent the Tree's inclin'd  Boastful and rough your first Son is a Squire  The next a Tradesman meek and much a Liar  Tom  struts a Soldier open bold and brave  Will  sneaks a Scriv'ner an exceeding Knave  Is he a Churchman then he's fond of Pow'r  A Quaker fly a Presbyterian sour  A smart Freethinker all things in an Hour  True some are open and to all Men known  Others so very close they're hid from none  So Darkness fills the Eye no less than Light  Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at sight  And ev'ry Child hates  Shylock  tho' his Soul  Still sits at squate and peeps not from its hole  At half Mankind when gen'rous  Manly  raves  All know 'tis Virtue for he thinks them Knaves  When universal homage  Umbra  pays  All see 'tis Vice and itch of vulgar praise  Who but detests th' Endearments of  Courtine  While  One  there is who charms us with his  Spleen  But these plain Characters we rarely find  Tho' strong the Bent yet quick the Turns of Mind  Here puzzling Contraries confound the whole  There Affectations quite reverse the Soul  The dull flat Falshood serves for Policy  And in the Cunning Truth itself's a Lye  Unthought of Frailties cheat us in the Wise  The Fool lies hid in Inconsistencies  See the same Man in vigour in the gout  Alone in company in Place or out  Early at Bus'ness and at Hazard late  Mad at a Foxchase wise at a Debate  Drunk at a Borough civil at a Ball  Friendly at  Hackney  faithless at  Whitehall  Catius  is ever moral ever grave  Thinks who endures a Knave is next a Knave  Save just a Dinnerthen prefers no Doubt  A Rogue with Ven'son to a Saint without  Who would not praise  Patritio  's high desert  His Hand unstain'd his uncorrupted Heart  His comprehensive head all Int'rests weigh'd  All  Europe  sav'd yet  Britain  not betray'd  He thanks you not his Pride was in Piquette  Newmarket  fame and Judgment at a Bett  What made say  Montagne  or more sage  Charron    Otho  a Warrior  Cromwell  a Buffoon  A perjur'd Prince a  leaden Saint  revere  A godless Regent tremble at a  Star  The Throne a  Bigot  keep a  Genius  quit  Faithless thro' Piety and dup'd thro' Wit  Europe  a Woman Child or Dotard rule  And just her  ablest  Monarch made a Fool  Know God and Nature only are the same  In Man the Judgment shoots at flying Game  A Bird of Passage lost as soon as found  Now in the Moon perhaps now under Ground  Ask Mens Opinions  J * * n  now shall tell  How trade increases and the World goes well  Strike off his Pension by the setting Sun  And  Britain  if not  Europe  is undone  Manners  with Fortunes  Humours  change with Climes  Tenets  with Books and  Principles  with Times  Judge we by  Nature  Habit can efface  Int'rest o'ercome or Policy take Place  By  Actions  those Un certainty divides  By  Passions  these Dissimulation hides  Affections  they still take a wider range  Find if you can in what you cannot change  'Tis in the  ruli ng Passion  There alone  The wild are constant and the cunning known  The Fool consistent and the false sincere  Priests Princes Women no Dissemblers here  This Clue once found unravels all the rest  The Prospect clears and  Clodio  stands confest  Clodio  the Scorn and Wonder of our Days  Whose ruling Passion was the  Lust of Praise  Born with whate'er could win it from the Wise  Women and Fools must like him or he dies  Tho' wond'ring Senates hung on all he spoke  The Club must hail him Master of the  Joke  Shall parts so various aim at nothing new  He'll shine a  Tully  and a  Wilmot  too  Then turns repentant and his God adores  With the same Spirit that he drinks and whores  Enough if all around him but admire  And now the Punk applaud and now the Fry'r  Thus with each Gift of Nature and of Art  And wanting nothing but an honest Heart  Grown all to  from no one Vice exempt  And most contemptible to shun Contempt  His Passion still to covet gen'ral praise  His Life to forfeit it a thousand Ways  His constant Bounty no one Friend has made  His Angel Tongue no mortal can persuade  A Fool with more of Wit than half Mankind  Too rash for Thought for Action too refin'd  A Tyrant to the Wife his Heart approves  A Rebel to the very King he loves  He dies sad outcast of each Church and Sate  And harder still flagitious yet not great  Ask you why  Clodio  broke thro' every Rule  'Twas all for Fear the Knaves shou'd call him Fool  Nature well known no Miracles remain  Comets are regular and  Clodio  plain  Yet in the search the wisest may mistake  If second Qualities for first they take  When  Catiline  by rapine swell'd his Store  When  Caesar  made a noble Dame a Whore  In this the Lust in that the Avarice  Were Means not ends Ambition was the Vice  That very  Caesar  born in  Scipio  's Days  Had aim'd like him by Chastity at praise  Lucullus  when Frugality could charm  Had roasted Turnips in the  Sabin  farm  In vain th' Observer eyes the Builder's toil  But quite mistakes the  Scaffold  for the  Pile  In this one Passion Man can strength enjoy  As Fits give vigour just when they destroy  Time that on all Things lays his lenient Hand  Yet tames not this It sticks to our last sand  Consistent in our Follies and our Sins  Here honest Nature ends as she begins  Behold a rev'rend Sire whom Want of Grace  Has made the Father of a nameless Race  Crawl thro' the Street shov'd on or rudely press'd  By his own Sons that pass him by unbless'd  Still to his Wench he creeps on knocking Knees  And envies ev'ry Sparrow that he sees  A Salmon's Belly  Helluo  was thy Fate  The Doctor call'd declares all help too late  Mercy cries  Helluo  Mercy on my Soul  Is there no Hope Alasthen bring the Jowl  " Odious in  Woollen  'twou'd a Saint provoke  Were the last Words that poor  Naroissa  spoke  " No let a charming Chintz and  Brussels  lace  " Wrap my cold Limbs and shade my lifeless Face  " One wou'd not sure be frightful when one's dead  " And  Betty  give this Cheek a little Red  Old Politicians chew on Wisdom past  And blunder on in Bus'ness to the last  As weak as earnest and as gravely  out  As sober  L * * w  dancing in the Gout  The Courtier smooth who forty Years had shin'd  An humble Servant to all Human Kind  Just brought out this when scarce his Tongue cou'd stir  " Ifwhere I'm goingI could serve you Sir"  " I give and I devise old  Euclio  said  And sigh'd "my Lands and Tenements to  Ned  "  Your Money Sir "My Money Sir what all  " Whyif I mustthen wept I give it  Paul  "  The Mannor Sir"The Mannor hold he cry'd  " Not thatI cannot part with that"and dy'd  And You brave COBHAM to the latest Breath  Shall feel your  ruling Passion  strong in Death  Such in those Moments as in All the past  " Oh save my Country Heav'n" shall be your last  FINIS
