 A SERIES of Genuine LETTERS BETWEEN HENRY AND FRANCES  Felices ter ampliùs  Quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis  Divulsus querimoniis  Supremâ citiùs solvet amor die  HOR Lib I Od  VOL I  LONDON Printed for W JOHNSTON in St  Paul's ChurchYard    MDCCLVII  HENRY TO THE EDITOR  SIR  _I Send you by the Bearer a Collection of the Letters which you complimented us so much upon when you were last at my House you should have had them before this but my  Clerk  had not finished them 'till Yesterday I should have stiled him  Secretary  for the greater Air of the Thing  You will find several Chasms in the Series of our Correspondence occasioned by our destroying on both Sides all the Letters which related to private History or private Business except a few which contained some Moral or other Sentiment and in general we neither of us preserved any of the other's Letters which we did not think might  be an Entertainment to us to read over again at some other Time which was a Manner I particularly have very often employed myself in for whenever I found my Resolution stagger with Regard to our Marriage or was offended at any of her Letters which betrayed Impatience Caprice or Suspicion of my Love I used to take out a Parcel from this Collection sometimes more or less according to the Disorder in my Affection and so read away 'till I had swallowed the  quantum Sufficit  to restore the full Health of my Attachment to her  And indeed it would amuse you greatly to hear the many ingenious Arts I have made use of for the first two or three Years of our Loves to preserve my Constancy toward her and I have actually several Times by the mere Force of Contemplation worked myself into such an Enthusiasm about her Knowledge Genius and Understanding that as you will casually observe in going through this Collection I have wrote  Latin  Philosophy and Metaphisicks to her during the Faroxisms of the Fit by which uncommon Proceeding  as I say in another Place  I reasoned myself into a real Passion for her  I will tell you whyIn Truth I could never have the least Enjoyment of Life without the sweet Indulgence of fond Affections and I always chose the most natural ones All the Pleasures of Sense the Beauties of Nature and the Pomp of Grandeur to me are tasteless As to a sick Man without a certain Tenderness of Sentiment a Something which as  Horace  expresses it  circum proecordia ludit  and gives a Relish to them all I had quitted an Engagement of this Sort about a Year before I entered into this because there were several Reasons which made it highly improper to continue in it and you cannot conceive what a wretched Vacuum of Life I passed during that Interval  "I rather pass'd than spent the Day" Before I could find out any Person whose Sense or Taste was agreeable enough to fix my Attachments I led an unsatisfactory Vague dissipated kind of Life during this Interregnum my Passions and Affections all in perfect Anarchy and like the Frogs petitioning  for a King My Mind was listless and my Time sauntered away without any Rule prescribed or purposed End At last like the worn out Smile of the  Patriarch  's Dove I found a resting Place and grew timerous of hazarding again a Flight back into the troubled Ocean of Life  Many of the Letters are displaced for want of Dates and even those which have them the Amanuensis has contrived to render Obscure meerly by his Regularity for as we corresponded for several Years three Times a Week without Intermission by copying the Letters according to their Dates he has introduced this Confusion that he has placed a Letter from  Frances  suppose because it was dated for Instance the Fourth of the Month immediately succeeding the Date of one of mine suppose of the Second or Third whereas he should have gone on to one of her's dated the Sixth for by not allowing the Interval of a Post the latter could not be an Answer to the former so that by taking them successively rather than alternately he has made several of them appear like  a Game of Cross Purposes where the Answer never corresponds with the Question except it be by Chance  However I have endeavoured to set these Matters right as well as I could by numbering the Letters which you are to attend to solely and not to the Pages but doubtless several Mistakes have slipt my Attention which I must leave to your own Observation to correct  In Return for all this Trouble which I have taken on your Account I hope for your critical Indulgence while you read over these hasty and incorrect Pieces wrote in the Hurry of a constant Correspondence many of them in the Midst of Business or Company and several in the Height of Sickness and in the Intervals of which  Aliter enim scribimus quod eos solos quibus mittimus aliter quod multos lecturos putamus  Cic Ep  If I had taken the Pains of copying out these Letters myself I could probably have put many of them in a better Dress and Letter ccxxxvii I should have left out intirely because I have  since been informed that the natural Principle which I presumed upon in that Letter about the Increase of Matter is false but I shall let it go along with several others which I think not worth reading because the Omission of them might break in upon the Thread of the Correspondence and because I promised to send you  bonâ fide  every Letter which had been preserved and this I take to be the best Way of dealing with a Friend to throw ourselves on his Mercy for the Whole of our Fault rather than make a partial Palliation by secreting any Part of it  I send you the Originals along with the Copy that you may compare them together which I confess I was too lazy to do but should be pleased if any one else would take the Trouble of doing  There are four Letters in this Collection and but four which have been wrote to three different Persons Letters clxxxvii cxc cxcii cxciii for having Occasion to write to those Persons upon the same Subjects the same Chain of Thought and Reasoning naturally  occurred but as they were wrote originally to  Fanny  I thought they had a Right to take their Places in the Course of this Collection  Adieu  HENRY  THE EDITOR TO THE PUBLICK  _I Here present you with a genuine Correspondence which passed for several Years between a Gentleman and Lady of the Kingdom of  Ireland  tho' the Scene has been laid in  England  by the Authors when the first Copy was made out as they designed to keep themselves unknown for Reasons which may be collected from some Parts of this Address and several Passages in their Letters  I endeavoured to prevail on the Parties to take the Trouble of digesting this Collection into a more regular Series than they are at present offered to you in but the various Business and family  Concerns which they are engaged in in the Country would not afford them Leisure And indeed there seems to obtain in them both a certain Indolence of Mind proceeding from a philosophick Acquiesence in their very narrow Fortunes which would prevent either of them from giving themselves so much Trouble as a Task of this Kind might require  But tho' they would not condescend to be Compilers even of their own Works I was in Hopes that they might be prevailed upon to undertake a Work of Genius by filling up the Chasms which appear too often in the Course of this Collection But this too they refused me from a certain Ingenuousness in their Natures which proceeded so far that tho' there were a good Number of entertaining Letters wrote since the last of these yet they would not suffer them to be inserted because they were written since the first Design of publishing this Collection which however was not any Thought of theirs during the whole Course of their Correspondence but hinted to them by Lady  O  so often  mentioned with Honour due in these Letters and who promised to prevail on Lord  O  a Nobleman of distinguished Sense Learning and classical Taste and who has sunk many eminent Titles of both Kingdoms in the private Character of the Man to revise and correct them for the Press but as higher Avocations have prevented them from appearing before the Publick with that Honour and Advantage I have obtained Leave after a Twelvemonth's Sollicitation to dispose of them after what Manner I please  But I have been so just to the Authors and to the Publick too that I have not left out even the most trifling Letter which came to my Hands my Design being not merely to give you a Collection of Letters but to present you with the genuine Pictures of two Persons whose Sense Wit and universal Benevolence do well intitle them to the publick Esteem but their Characters are better described by their own Writings than by any Thing I can say to recommend them for which Reason I have not attempted to make a single Alteration nor upon comparing  these Letters with the Originals which were sent me along with the Copy do I find there has been any Alteration made except the changing of one Word for another shifting the Scene as I hinted in the Beginning and the leaving out whole Paragraphs which related as  Henry  has expressed it in the foregoing Letter to private History or private Business  The Editor of St  Evremond  's Works speaks as follows in Part of his Preface to the third Volume  One of the Objections made to this Author is that odd Medley of serious and comical of grave Matters and Trifles which is to be met with in his Writings Would it not have been sufficient say certain austere and difficult Persons to have made a Collection of all that is good and solid Why was not every Thing left out that is not only useless but waggish  Those People who would have us apply ourselves only to useful Studies ought to consider that our Author is a Doctor who writes to instruct and dogmatize and that he is not a Man engaged by his Profession  to give the Publick an Account of his Time and Studies He is a Gentleman who having much Leisure seeks how to pass away the Time agreeably who writes sometimes on one Subject sometimes on another only for his own Amusement He is a Man of Wit who proposes to divert himself as well as certain Persons with whom he converses It would most certainly be unjust to judge of him with too much Rigour and the Injustice would be yet greater to oblige those who publish his Works to suppress all such as are purely diverting  So much by Way of Apology both for my Authors and myself for I think the above Quotation is applicable thro' the Whole to our Case  As to the Chasms I cannot barely say  Nonnulla defunt  but  Hiatus valdé deflendi  and when I declared my Design of publishing and applied a second Time to have the Chain connected I was told by  Henry  that he thought it not fair Dealing with the Publick that besides he thought they appeared at present more genuine than a complete  Suite of Letters would do and farther said that if the regular Series had been preserved from the Beginning he would take out an Handful here and there at random and throw them into the Fire lest it might be suspected that they were wrote or preserved with a Design of publishing as he was humble enough to think that they could have but very little Merit in this View In Allusion to which he told me a Story of a certain Lady who upon reading over a Letter she had wrote about Business to a Gentleman and thinking it too Orthographical for a Woman added an e to the Ende of severale Wordse leste it should bee suspected that she had spelte by the Aid of a Dictionarye  This Whim of his which however may be justified from a thorough Knowledge of Mankind puts me in mind of the virtuoso Taste for mutilated Statues and time eaten Coins where the Parts which remain rise in Value in Proportion to those which are lost or to the  Dutch  device of burning half their Spices in order to inhance the Price of the rest  But I was at length of Opinion with him in not framing any Letters to supply the Chasms because it would as he observed be disingenuous to give the Publick any Thing in this Collection which was not Original therefore I have not as I said before even taken the Liberty which the Authors paid me the high Compliment of indulging me in of altering any one Sentence which I thought might be better expressed or displacing any Argument which I presumed might perhaps be put in a stronger Light for certainly any Person of a curious Taste would rather see a true Copy of any Classick's original Text though incorrect than read all  Bentleii Emendationes    However I have thrown in a Note here and there to explain the Occasion upon which some of the Letters were wrote and to clear up some particular Passages or Allusions which might not perhaps be intelligibe to every Reader I have also arranged the Letters according to the Numbers which are prescribed in the foregoing Letter and these are all the Merits which I  claim to myself except the Publication in the Course of the following Collection  As I know nothing of the Lady but from her Writings I am not enabled to give any particular Account of her private History except that she is of a Gentleman's Family and had a very genteel Education but was left very young without a Father and without a Fortune She isbut  Henry  himself will better tell you what she is and making poetical Allowances for the Hyperbole of his warm Manner of expressing himself in her Favour I do not think he has at all exaggerated her Praise And if his Writings do not sufficiently describe her Worth I could supply their Deficiency to the entire Satisfaction of the World if I was at Liberty to tell them who Lady  O  is and that she received her early into her Matronage and Friendship from no other Tie or Attachment but the Goodness of her Character and the Excellency of her Understanding  Henry  is a Person of as good a Family as any in this Kingdom whose Patrimony was formerly looked upon  to be very considerable but Losses and Misfortunes in his Family have reduced his Fortunes to a very moderate Competence at present  His Education was unfortunately neglected notwithstanding the early and continued fair Omens he always gave of the happy Issue which might have been expected from it While he was very young he essay'd his genius in Poetry and wrote several Things which I have been told were surprizing for one of his Years and untutored Mind  He kept Copies of them for several Years as he told me himself 'till finding himself bereft at last of all Hope of an Education learned and polite enough to introduce him to  Apollo  's Court he threw them into the Fire and applied his Mind to graver Studies saying after his lively Manner that a bad Shoemaker was preferable to a bad Poet for that it was better to coble for Bread than coble to starve  Being at length left upon the World at large he had Sobriety and Address enough to introduce himself by Degrees into the genteelest and most reputable  Company but grew soon weary of the active Idleness as he termed it of a City Life and retired upon a Visit to a near Relation in the Country where he passed several Years in reading teaching himself  French  and studying Husbandry philosophically Then he engaged himself in a Farm and the Linen Manufacture in the Management of which and reading he has employed himself for several Years past and where we shall now take our Leave of him for the Present  His Acquaintance with  Frances  was accidental and commenced on his Part as an Affair of Gallantry but finding no Probability of Success and being enamoured with her Writings Conversation and Character became at last a real and honourable Lover but declined Matrimony for several Years as she had no Fortune and his Expectations from his Father were much larger than they are likely to turn out To which Consideration you may add his other Relations and Friends whose Interest he had great Prospects from tho' 'tis probable he may as he has hitherto been be deceived in these too  At length they married and it would not be amiss if the Reader before he proceeded should turn over to Letter ccxvi where he will find the noblest and most rational Arguments given for taking this Step that ever justified an Action which the World might deem imprudent and if the Design of this Publication was merely to stamp a Character for my Friend I need only print that Paper to his Praise But as I am certain that the Publick will receive a very agreeable and improving Entertainment from the whole Collection I shall detain them no longer from the Perusal of them than while I subscribe myself their unknown humble Servant  The EDITOR  To the Right Reverend Lord Bishop of  Clogher    My LORD  _YOU will doubtless be surprized at an Address from a Man who declares himself a Stranger to you and to whom even your Person is unknown  I acknowledge indeed that I have been particularly conversant in your Lordship's Writings but contrary to the usual Tenor of Dedications I mean not to confer Honour on you but on myself by declaring my Approbation and Esteem in general of all your Works  And yet this is not the Consideration which has induced me to place these Papers under your Patronage but  Henry  has  often in private Coversations with me raised your Lordship's Character higher in my Opinion than the best Writings can do as  One moral or a meer well natur'd Deed  Does all desert in Sciences exceed  And it is owing purely to such Hints as these that I have been prompted to borrow your Name to usher a Work to the World which is remarkable among other Excellencies for Humanity Charity and universal Love  I am with great Respect    My  LORD  Your most humble and most obedient Servant  The EDITOR  A

FRANCES    LETTER I  FRANCES  to  HENRY    _THOUGH I have not any Thing to say which can amuse you yet I could not think of sending you the inclosed Pamphlet under a blank Cover as a silent Remembrance is worse than none  I return'd to  ConduitStreet  the Evening you left us but found it was not the same Place  In short as  Pope  says the Sensation is like that of a Limb lopt off which one is every Minute unawares applying to Use but finds it is not  The Tune of  Delia  sounded in my Ears all Night and I could have sat by for the first Time with Patience while you play'd  Alberti  's twelve Concerto's to have had you back again for the Remainder of the Evening  Now let me shift the Scene and behold you galloping away delighted with the certain Prospect of giving as much Joy to those Friends you go to as you have left Concern with those you parted from At this Thought I begin to hate you and myself for being one Moment uneasy about a Man who perhaps hardly remembers me enough to forget me I am so mortified at this that I am angry at myself for having ever thought of you but as a common Acquaintance if indeed your Merit or particular Behaviour to me would have suffered me to remain in such a State of Indifference These Thoughts however do not proceed from any slight Opinion I have of your Sincerity but a mortal Apprehension that neither my Sense or Merits can purchase your Esteem without which your Love would shock me  I am running on too far mais il y à quelque chose de dans qui m'entraine So I shall conclude with some Lines of  Cowley  tho' you call him a surfeiting Author  Each Day think on me and each Day I shall  For thee make Hours canonical  By every Wind that comes this Way  Send me at least a Sigh or two  Such and so many I'll repay  As shall themselves make Winds to get to you  I know you will laugh as you did at  Tom  's Correspondent for tagging her Letters but consider I want a Poet's Help to speak to you though I need none to think of you  Frances  LETTER II  HENRY  to  FRANCES    Ma Chere Mignonne  QUELLE foule des affaires m'accable I thought to have wrote this Letter in  French  but you are too nice a Critick for me Only imagine to yourself a Person who has every Day of his Life as much Business to do as can be well compassed in twentyfour Hours to have three Months Affairs come upon him at once One who could scarce spare Time from the Hurry of Business in Town for  Love  and  Alberti  to be confronted with such an Embarras du MondeWithout your sprightly Conversation or my  Twelve Concerto's  to support my Spirits  Your very agreeable Letter I confess to have more than have repaid me for  Alberti  giving me Sense for Sound but nothing you can say or any one else can do will make me Amends for the Want of your Company if you would be as kind when present as you express yourself in Absence but as I have good Reason to think you Coquette in this Matter I swear it is a most cruel Treatment to give me Hopes which you have not Generosity or Courage to fulfil This is disingenuous Behaviour and very unkind too for I am of too sanguine a Constitution to bear Disappointments with Indifference and tho' I can fast a Day upon a Page in  Epictetus  yet I could not live one Night upon all the Volumes of  Plato    Henry  LETTER III  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THE only Consolation I had in the Midst of my Anxiety for your leaving Town was the pleasing Hope of an agreeable Correspondent but I find you design to rob me of that too for you seem inclined to misconstrue the Sentiments of an  Heart  touched with the most lively Esteem for the Effects of a Coquette Humour  Will you not suffer me to think of you but in an hostile WayAre you afraid I should love you too well that you thus make it my Duty to hate you I ought indeed to endeavour it at least to make a suitable Return for the Sentiments you seem to have towards me  As to your Hurry of Business I wish I could share or alleviate that or any Thing else which makes you uneasy but this like most of my Wishes is fruitless And I am poor even in Thanks for your obliging Compliment but I dare say that some new Acquaintance will soon make you ample Amends for the Loss of an old one  Frances  LETTER IV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I WAS never passionately fond of the Country but you have made me hate it You know my Nature jealous and I cannot help considering  Belvidere  as a beloved Rival who monopolizes all your Time yet like a true Woman I sincerely long to see it not to admire but to depreciate all it's Charms tho' much I fear there will be no Room for Envy so to work for I am apt to think that whatever you design and execute must be perfect  I have a great Mind if I thought it would vex you not to write to you this Month for your failing to answer my  Tuesday  's Letter but I will believe you did not receive it Time enough for I dare hope you would not fail me in a Matter of Business You may see by this that my Spirits are much recovered for when they are low I am always humble and desponding  You say that I never did nor ever will do any Thing you recommend to me and I am picqued into a Principle of Contradiction and resolvednot to do any Thing henceforward but what you desire In short you vile Men have strange Ways with us poor Women and you want but Power to be most admirable Tyrants  I must repeat what I have often told you that I never took ill any Advice you gave me for I could not be such a Child as to misinterpret the Kindness of your Design tho' I might be feeble enough to resent the Harshness of your Discipline I have from my Infancy been used to a fatal Delicacy Fatal indeed to me as it has enervated every Faculty of my Soul and superadded a thousand tender Weaknesses to the Weakest of the weaker Sex You were yourself my dear  Harry  as the Lawyers term it "accessary after the Fact" and helped to augment this Foible in me perhaps beyond a Cure The Tenderness of your Manners the  Fondness of your Expressions and the Softness of your Letters joined to render my weak Mind more delicate It is true that from the transitory State of sublunary Things I ought to know that our Passions are as variable as the Moon "Which monthly changes in her circling Orb" and that we should not depend on the Tempers or Affections of Men which can ebb and flow as frequent as the Sea  But bid Physicians preach our Veins to Temper  And with an Argument new set a Pulse  c  I acknowledge myself obliged for the friendly Concern you express at my Want of Health But for Heaven's Sake why need you be so anxious to divest yourself of that little Tenderness which remains for me At your Time of Life to set up for a  Stoick  is something extraordinary indeed and without assuming that insensate Apathy which they pretend to I cannot conceive what Glory you can find in an affected Insensibility for one who feels the tenderest Friendship and Esteem for you Adieu  Frances  LETTER V  Dear  FANNY  THE Indifference you mention is like other Matters unfairly laid to my Charge I feel no such mortal Symptom of a Decay in my Love therefore my dear  Goddess of Health  Hygea  you have with Reverence to your Divinity mistaken my Disorder If I do not indeed write in the same gallant gay Stile as formerly it is because no Man ever continued to do so except some vain Fop to shew his Wit his Jeu d'esprit or Tour d'expression I had already said every Thing which a fond Heart could dictate and instead of ransacking the Poets for apt Expressions which shew more of Fancy than of Love I for the Rest of my Life sincerely meant and purposed to prove my Attachments by Actions not by Words Few Words among Friends are best they say then fewer still between Lovers whose whole Life should be a Repetition of silent Minutes  Where Words meet Words e're from the Lips they part  My former Letters to which you allude were proper to persuade you into a Belief of my Passion for you But when you seemed convinced of  that Truth I thought it Time to quit romantick Flights for a more rational Converse In the Mathematicks some general Principles are at first demonstrated and then they are taken for granted thro' the Remainder of the Study for if they were to be repeated on every Occasion Science would be intolerably tedious  In short if my Professions are not as frequent as usual or my Expressions as fond it is owing to what  Shakespear  says for  Cordelia    Her full Heart  Reverberates no hollow Sound of Emptiness  The Paper you sent me does not answer the Character of it or perhaps I may have thought it insipid and inelegant having read it just after your dear Letter  Henry  LETTER VI  Dear  HARRY  THE Account of your Adventures diverted me extremely for I am always pleased when you seem so I wish you were not too wise and too lazy to write a Novel for I fancy you could do it admirably and it would be an easier Task for you than almost any Man for I think your whole Life and Character have a great deal of that Stile in them I wish I had  any Thing equally entertaining to amuse you with but my Set of Acquaintance may be properly called a Set for there is such a Sameness runs through them all that they are hardly to be distinguished but by their Voice and Features and are liable to such a Censure as somebody blundered out when he wanted to compliment a Collection of Portraits "All alike all alike" When I am confined to such machine Society which is too often my Fate I fancy I am got into  Powell  's Commonwealth and am looking about for the Wires to give them some Variety of Motion  Oh my dear  Harry  how cruel is it in you to torture me thus to raise my Taste for higher Joys yet leave me condemned to such mean Society for while I correspond with thee I fancy myself somewhat like  Dives  in the Parable condemned to Torments and conversing with  Abraham    Adieu Adieu  LETTER VII  Dear  HARRY  London  THOUGH you unkindly denied me the Liberty of enquiring about your Health last Night yet in a Matter where my Happiness is so much at Stake you must excuse my disobeying  your Commands by intreating you to let me know how my dear  Harry  does this Morning I will not be answered by the common Return to impertinent  How d'ye's  but insist on having what I shall always give Credit to nay what I esteem as an Oracle I hope you will not refuse me a Line to give me an Assurance of your Health and allow me to taste of Ease which I have not done since we parted though it is all I hope for 'till we meet again  For in thy Absence Joy is seen no more  I know not what I write my Head is quite giddy with my Fears for you which have not suffered me to sleep an Hour all Night You know though I do not the  Greek  Name for SelfTormentorthen save me from myself and tell me telling me Truth that you are well  F  Tuesday  MorningEight o'Clock When was I up so early  LETTER VIII  My Dear  FANNY  I AM much recovered since last Night tho' Mrs 's Devil of a Caustick has made my Throat as sore on the Outside as it was before within I felt all Night as  Hercules  did after he had put on  Dejanira  's Gift not that  she is any more to my  Dejanira  than I to  Hercules  who resemble him in nothing but that I am  To a Distaff chained  This Day would perhaps discourage a Man in better Health and Senses from stirring out But I have ordered my Horses immediately to shew the steddy Purpose of my Life which tho' your Commands diverted me from last Night neither the Severity of the Weather or acute Disorder shall be able to alter on any other Occasion You have here a Paraphrase Translation of the first Ode of  Anacreon  which I wrote last Night after you left me to amuse my Pain  My Fiddle I would fain employ  To sing the Chiefs who ruin'd  Troy    To  Cadmus  too my Fingers move  But my  Cremona  answers  Love    I change the Strings rosin my Bow  Praise on  Alcides  to bestow  I raise them high and strike them round  But  Love  alone they still resound  Adieu ye Heros and ye Kings  Of  Love  alone my  Fiddle  sings  LETTER IX  FRANCES  to  HENRY    IT has been a Fortnight since I heard from you 'till this Day during which Time my Life has been so perfect a Vacuum that I do not recollect Circumstances enough to know whether I existed during that Interval I am apt to think with the  Pythagoreans  that my Spirit grown weary of it's Confinement in so small a Prison had a Mind to animate some nobler Animal which it was in search of for so many Days but like the gadding  Dove  finding no Place of Rest has return'd again I cannot say it has brought the  OliveBranch  in it's Mouth tho' like  Mahomet  's Pigeon it has returned with a Letter more calculated for War than Peace as it seems to denounce the Loss of your Friendship as well as your Love but I shall not so easily renounce the Former as my Prudence inspires me to resign the Latter  You must surely have lost all Sense of either when you could think so meanly of me as you seem to do in your last Letter Have you forgot with what Satisfaction I received that Proof of your Confidence which you would now withdraw You tell me I shall hear no more of it but let me tell you if I do not you shall never hear the Last of it for I have fancied more Joy  in embracing that dear little Adoption than ever you received in the Arms of it's Mother I have not Thanks to Providence yet reduced myself to such an abject State as to have Reason to be jealous of your Amours nor do I heed  If here or there his Glances flew  Oh free for ever be his Eye  Whose Heart to me is always true  Frances  LETTER X  HENRY  to  FRANCES    THE Account you give me of Miss 's Rivalship is very entertaining but I return you the Letter because you seem to apprehend I should make an improper Use of it  When she said that "Beauty is Vanity" her Moral was certainly very good but she betrays at the same Time that Ugliness is  Vexation of Spirit  To be rendered an Object of Love is the Gift of Nature and very few are indowed with such a Blessing but I think Providence has put it out of the Power of fewer still to make themselves esteemed But Emulation not Jealousy must work this happy Effect  Beauty is at best but a flowery Triumph and that Person must have a very poor Ambition who does not struggle for the longest and surest Empire  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XI  Dear  FANNY  I DID not receive your Letter according to the Date of it and the Delay must have happened with you for I was at the PostOffice when your Letter came in last Night  Your Account of Miss 's Week's Route of Diversions made me laugh but I was actually out of Breath by the Time I had got to  Saturday  Night such a Passion for Shews and publick Places is natural to young People but there are many ridiculous Persons in the World who hurry thro' Life after the same Rate up to their grand Climacterick and in short the generality of Mankind seem rather to have a Stomach than a Taste for Pleasure  Call it Diversion and the Pill goes down  Which is entirely owing to the abrupt Entrance into the World which young People are too soon indulged in and makes them continue Children all the Days of their Lives as I have  observed that if you broach a Vessel of Liquor before it has purged off it's Crudities it will still drink new tho' you keep it on Draught never so long I wish all the Children of our Kingdom were made Children of the Publick as was the Method of some antient States but then without such antient StatesMen my Wish is absurd as  Horace  's proposing to fly from  Rome  as an Expedient against the Corruption of the People's Morals as if the Vice was rather in the Stones of the Street than in the Manners of the Citizens He who would reform publick Politicks must first reclaim private Morals and I agree rather with  Plato  who founds his Commonwealth on the Basis of Virtue than with  Harrington  who affirms the Bodypolitick to be a Machine  Adieu  LETTER XII  Dear  SPRIGHTLY  I RECEIVED your Ballad and read it to a large Company of Wit and Taste with proper Stops and Emphases It was extremely liked and Copies begged which I refused according to your Commands It really is in the true BalladStile and has a very pretty Turn of Poetry in it  I read  Cowley  's Translation or rather Imitation of  Anacreon  's first Ode which you sent me and am better pleased with my own than I was before for it is closer to the Original is short and has no affected Turn in it but what is in the Original  My reasons for withholding not refusing as you call it my Friendship at present are these which follow  I forget whether it is your favourite  Rochefaulcaut  or  La Bruyere  who says  there may be an Affection between Persons of different Sexes without any farther Desire or Thought but as they certainly regard each other as of different Genders this cannot be called pure Love or pure Friendship but is a mixed Affection of a third Sort  Now my dear  Fanny  since our Friendship cannot be pure let us stick to that Passion which may be so and is in effect but a warmer and more intimate Friendship Your only Reason for preferring  Platonics  must be that you imagine they may last longer than Love and if we were  Antediluvians  your Choice might be prudent but he that is born of the Women nowadays has but a short Time to live therefore it must certainly be better Oeconomy to make our Joys exceed in Exquisiteness what they fall short of in Duration by which Means we are beforehand with old  Time  and he has less to cut us off from  when he draws his Scythe But as they say Time strengthens Friendship and weakens Love you may with a little Patience see your strange Scheme come to pass at last upon this Assurance that I shall always add to one what I diminish from the other and perhaps we may become an hopeful old Couple in Time  We should do in Life as Gamesters do at Play push away for what they call the great Game but finding the Run against us we are then and not 'till then to play our Cards for the after Game Now when we find Love beginning to decline we may shuffle a good sober Friendship out of it but Love never was pieced up out of a decayed Friendship So that indeed my  Dear  you seem to begin at the wrong End and have both Reason and Nature against you  I am my dearest  Sappho  or tenth Muse  Your's c  LETTER XIII  HALF angry Half pleased with my dear  Harry  's sprightly EpistleI am quite divided whether I should make any Reply to it or not but I have still so much Regard left for you as to wish to convince you that your Opinion  is quite erroneous Love which is not founded on Esteem can neither be real or permanent it is only the Effect of a wanton Caprice and is more likely to terminate in Disgust than Friendship Pure Love like pure Gold cannot subsist without an Allay which tho' it debases the ideal Value enhances the true one by making them both Love and Gold more fixed and fit for Use and I dare answer for it that the Love which does not begin in Friendship will never end there But Friendship is independent requires no Mixture no Allay it's Purity contrary to the Nature of Gold is it's Strength and Stability nor is it without it's Elevations and Transports the mutual Contemplation of Truth and the Communication of Knowledge being higher Enjoyments than mortal Sense is capable of and as  Young  says upon this Subject  True Friendship warms it raises it transports  Like Musick pure the Joy without Allay  Whose very Rapture is Tranquility  But Love like Wine gives a tumultuous Bliss  Heighten'd indeed beyond all mortal Pleasures  But mingles Pangs and Madness in the Bowl  As Friendship then is independent of Love and selfsufficient in it's own Nature why may it not subsist from it's own Purity between Persons of different Sexes tho' with the Advantage of more Delicacy on one Side and more Respect on  the other which is more likely to make Friendship lasting than that Freedom and Equality which is generally between male Friends This  Platonick  Love which I am describing is of the Nature of that Affection which subsists between Father and Daughter Brother and Sister which consists of such a guardian Benevolence on one Side and such a Gratitude on the other as makes the most charming Society in the World  Recant thou Prophane nor offend me again by so much as hinting at that Love which is independent of Friendship  Adieu  Frances  LETTER XIV  My Dear  FANNY  YOUR Essay on Love and Friendship I acknowledge to be somewhat too abstracted and refined for me  So Angels love so let them love for me  When I'm an Angel so my Love shall be  In the mean Time my  Dear    let us e'en talk a little like Folks of this World  I know the Objections to my natural Scheme are that it is vulgar and brutal now by calling it vulgar they acknowledge it to be the common Sense of Mankind and what all Men agree in must be right  Vox Populi Vox Dei is the Adage for it  As to the Grossness of the Passion I think as Brutes are indulged but once a Year and Man the Year round we may fairly conclude Providence to have set the Mark of a rational Pleasure upon what is called a brutal Desire  I believe it possible in Nature tho' not in human Nature that there may be such a refined Love as you describe but then it must be reserved for that State where we shall live without Food and wrapt up in Hallelujah's resign the Pleasures of Sense for a Song  I have been very ill these ten Days past but no Matter for that  Mal que je suis je retiens mes Esprits  Et badiner à jamais l'Apothême de ma vie  Adieu  LETTER XV  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED your voluntary Epistle and am therefore to return you double Thanks and that I do not perform such Works of Supererogation is not on the Word of a Christian for Want of a superlative Devotion but the mere moral Want of Power perhaps the Want of  Grace  I am like a bad Pump into which you must pour Water before you can work it to Effect But then alas in Return for your  Pierian  Spring you have from me but the Rakings of a Kennel I am a mere Ghost in Wit and cannot speak 'till spoken to My highest Boast is to be your Shadow and must wait on your Substance in order to my own Appearance and if ever I put in the least Pretence to Wit it is owing to that Faculty in you which  Falstaff  pretended to of being not only witty yourself but the Cause of Wit in other People  I am extremely concerned to find you in such a gloomy Habit of Mind for Heaven's Sake why do you indulge such Spleen a Moment while you have the Powers from your own proper Fund of good Sense natural Spirit and Capacity of entertaining yourself of chacing away the  Fou fiend  If I hear any more from you in this Strain I shall recall the Compliment I paid you in a late Letter of a tenth Muse and rank you among the former odd Number of musty old Crones and give you the Place of the worst of them all namely a diabolical miserable Pelt of an old Maid called  Melpomene    I beg to hear from you constantly and never wait the Slowness of my Motions in Writing when you may be truly assured that my Heart at least keeps Time with yours tho' you may perhaps have more  Love  as well as Wit at your Fingers Ends  Your's in Truth  LETTER XVI  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I AM extremely pleased to find you in so chearful an Humour as your last informed me of it at the same Time flatters my Vanity as I appear in some sort to be the Occasion of it and in this I triumph that the Effect has at length answered the Constancy and Sincerity of my Endeavours Never suspect my Friendship or my Love after the Assurance I gave you that when I grow indifferent in either I will ingenuously confess it to you though How should I have Courage enough to declare a Thing for which I can never have a Reason  It concerns me indeed to hear you still complain of your Disorder but I often told you your Aid was not so much from Medicines as Regimen and Peace of Mind Let me have a better Account of your Health in your next or don't say any Thing about it for talking of those Things but makes them worse and must be uneasy to me as well as you  I am the same Man still to you and I blush to say it the same to myself too  Henry  LETTER XVII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED your Letter I shall not say Favour What you mention to me in relation to a Lady is Part of the World's Impertinence these many Years plaguing me with one Wife or other which I never thought of and the World is very much obliged to you for authorizing it's Impertinence for I shall bear it henceforward with better Temper when I find that a Person of your Understanding and good Breeding cannot avoid falling into the same provoking Raillery  If I were really such a goodfornothing Fellow as you take me for you have given me great Encouragement by shewing with what good Temper you can bear ill Usage for surely if I was when in Town or since I came down to the Country in any Manner engaged by Contract or Affections to any Woman alive I should have merited the highest Resentment to have said or wrote what I did to you Were the Merits and Fortune of the Lady you mention equal to my Wishes and within their Power the Consideration of the Friend you likewise mention would make me turn my Thoughts another Way and say with  Tamerlane  to  Moneses    I will not lose thee poorly for a Woman  Thus am I obliged to your Opinion for being thought capable of two the basest and most disingenuous Acts human Nature can be guilty of Falshood in Love and Dishonesty in Friendship  While I labour under such vile Suspicions it would pay you no Compliment the subscribing myself either your Lover or Friend  Henry  LETTER XVIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    ROCHFAUCAULT says  that nothing ought to make us wonder but that we should be still able to wonder at any Thing  But among all the Things I have ever met with to astonish me nothing has equalled your Letter I shall not say Favour any more than you In short the Statue of Surprize tho' done by  Phidias  would but faintly represent my Figure by the Time I had got to the End of your well penned Acrostick"  And fall these Sayings from that gentle Tongue  Where civil Speech and soft Persuasion hung  How could you possibly return me such an Answer to a Letter made up of Softness Tenderness and Fears And where for your Happiness or Advantage I generously offered to resign that  Love which you flattered me with and which 'till I received the Rudeness of your Letter I had Reason to think might have made the Happiness of my LifeBut we are now quit and your Generosity is equal to mine in throwing off the Masque which might have deceived me too far and it was extremely kind to open my Eyes before I was quite got to the Brink of a Precipice You seem to understand that Maxim very well  That the Violence which we use to preserve Love is worse than Infidelity  How should I imagine that your Marrying that Lady was a Breach of Friendship I rather thought that whom you honoured with your Friendship you honoured with your Alliance and he would be unworthy your Attachment who did not think so And as for my own Part I endeavoured to represent what you said or wrote to me merely as the Effects or Essay of a certain vague Gallantry which Men of Wit and Spirit exercise upon every silly Woman who comes in their Way  If you do not credit me in this Justification you may at least believe my Pride which would scorn to harbour a base or mean Opinion of one whom even that very Pride esteemed  I have thus condescended to make an Apology for the Letter which has offended you but more to vindicate myself than to satisfy you and I mention the Word  Condescension  from  no other Idea of Heighth or Superiority but what the Injured have over those who wrong them by having it in their Power to forgive which as it is a Thing you may almost plead a prescriptive Right to I shall not be disappointed if I receive no Thanks for  Frances  LETTER XIX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    See how Amazement on me sits  O Praxiteles  WHY my little Pet and a spoiled Pet thou art what Reason in the World had you to resent my Letter except as Children do being whipt when they do Mischief  I must have been extremely unworthy your least Regard if I had not resented being thought a Trifler at least which indeed was the smallest Part of your Charge against me and I must have thought you unworthy mine if I had not been highly piqued at being thought so by you  You still carry on your Unkindness by charging me with Rudeness in my Letter which I remember not at least I am very sure I had no Sentiment of Illbreeding in my Mind about you but if the Roughness of my Manners has offended you I ask your Pardon  Then you tell me I have thrown off the Masque  c c  In short I make such a paultry Figure thro' the Course of your Anecdotes that I should be ashamed to reoffer you my Love and Friendship if my Inclinations did not get the Better of my Modesty to assure you that they are both at your Service when ever you think them worth your Acceptance  Henry  LETTER XX  My dearest  HARRY  I RECEIVED your fond and elegant Letter I mean of the th Date for those Characteristicks could hardly distinguish which of your Letters I allude to  I am pleased to find I am at length brought to such a steady Temper of Mind as to be able to bear without Emotion those giddy Heighths to which your Praise used to raise me so that your Approbation now rather makes me emulous than vain However I owe this Strength not to my own Sense but to your Constancy as Use prevents our being affected with elevated Situations  Whatever Sense Accomplishment or Merit I have were inspired from your Precept Example and Instruction and like  Pygmalion  you  are become inamoured of the Works of your own Hands How doubly kind is it in a Master first to make his Pupil perfect in his Art and then commend him for his Excellence in it Farewel my Guide and Safeguard too thro' all the dangerous Paths of Life  LETTER XXI  My dear  FANNY  WE might have got farther Tonight but I chose to stop here for two Reasons the first was my Impatience to write to you and the next that I was heartily tired of my Companion who was too well mounted to escape from on the Roadbut I have locked myself up here  He is one of those  Matteroffact Men  who being incapable of striking out any Thing or Idea from their own Sense or Imaginations are eternally talking of what they have seen or heard as if they were reading over a MemorandumBook and whose whole Conversation is a Diary of their Lives for which Reason they are never tired of talking because they are themselves the chief Subjectmatter of their Discourse I asked him a little peevishly this Evening whether he had ever committed Muder  that he could not bear his own Thoughts a Moment  Perhaps I should have borne him with more Patience at any other Time but having so lately parted from your charming Converse I became more nice about my Company and less capable of any Entertainment except this of Writing to you while the happy Wretch is prating below Stairs to the Waiter  I have not Time now to send you the Rules or Maxims you promised to conduct yourself by with Regard to your Life and Health but if you consult your own Reason and Understanding I flatter myself you will have the Essence of them before I can reduce them into a dull Form  Adio Cara  LETTER XXII  Dear  HARRY  I HAVE no News to write but what I believe is none at present that I am very angry with you Now do but observe Spectators what an innocent Countenance he puts on such Gentleness of Manners and Demureness of Features that it would require Proofs equal to Mathematical Demonstration to convict him and yet I know this plausible Man to be worse  than a Devil because he has Art enough to hide his cloven Foot But alas Rage is the shortest Passion of a Woman's Soul and I find to quote a Passage from one of your Letters that  Absence to Lovers like Death to Enemies buries every Fault and enlivens every Virtue  However I am glad that you are in the Country that I may have the Pleasure to think of you in the most amicable Light tho' it is possible I lye for perhaps I have done nothing else but wish you back ever since you went Yet it is a vain Task to think of rivalling your  Naids Dryades  and  Hamadryads  so in Allusion to your Song I must "make a Virtue of Necessity" and be content  I am quite ashamed of this vilepenned Scrawl not of Quality but I hope you will excuse it when I tell you that this Pen was made by  Noah  and plucked from the Wing of that ungrateful  Raven  which flew from the  Ark  and returned not again and has been worn to the Stump by old Maids in making Anecdotes of Teatable talk ever since  Adieu  LETTER XXIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I DID not write to you before because I thought it a Solecism in good Breeding to pay you a Visit en passant as Country Gentlemen call it making an Inn of one's House Besides it would have been no Compliment to you to have wrote from an Inn where I was dull and idle so deferred it 'till I came here where I have a World of Business and the highest Entertainment that a Number of agreeable Women can give to a Man of my Constitution And to raise the Compliment higher "car il est bon de se fair valoir" I assure you I have a Struggle with myself at present about Writing to you at all lest my Letters should fall into aukward Hands during  Tom  's Illness but my Inclinations with Regard to you have always been too strong for my Prudence so on I venture with a "hoping these few Lines  c  I cannot forgive your making  Noah  's Messenger a  Raven  a Bird of ill Omen when you might have made so many pretty Allusions to the  Dove  Emblem of Love and Peace I beg henceforward your Quills may be gently drawn from the Pinion of the fond cooing Turtle and  that the harsh Croking of that boading Fowl may never once assault my Ears  Here I might bring in a Subjectmatter applicable but shall postpone it 'till I am sure there are none but Friends by The same Reason shall prevent me from giving my Thoughts upon the Business you mentioned to me at parting 'till I hear  Tom  is able to walk Abroad so shall conclude at present with an extempore Tag  Vive la joye et l'amour  Et Diable emporte les Caseurs  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XXIV  MY dear  Harry  's Letter at last relieved me from ten thousand Anxieties while you were on your Journey which are better felt than expressed If you knew what Pain your Negligence gives me I am sure you would be a little more punctual in your Correspondence but I almost despair of ever making you sensible of the Delicacy of my Sentiments and am sorry to find that you are still unknowing in my Heart However I accept your Apologies for  with Ease alas we credit those we love  But I beg henceforward that you would not be guilty of voluntary Faults and  Omissions merely to shew with what Address you can excuse them  I do not at all doubt your being perfectly happy in the Company of agreeable Women and more so than other Men can  oast in being approved by them But  why am I told how  Pyrrhus  loves or hates  unless it be to mortify my Vanity or hint that my Letters may be an impertinent Interruption to your Pleasures at  Elton  Yet I am encouraged to write more particularly at this Time because perhaps you may more readily come into my  Platonick  Scheme and that we may without Loss of Time enter upon that charming System I beg that by Return of the Post you will send me a full and true History of your giddy wandering Heart from the Time it last trembled at a Rod to its present Fluttering at Miss  Rawley  's Feet whom I know to be one of your Company and probably the fairest but I shall pursue this Subject no farther for I find myself beginning to grow grave which is the next Step to growing dull  I am offended at your seeming to doubt my Knowledge in Sacred History so shall refer you to the th Verse of the th Chapter of  Genesis  where you will find that the first living Creature which fallied out of the  Ark  was that very identical  Raven  mentioned in my last Letter I disclaim all Commerce with the  Dove    because it returned with an  OliveBranch  and I here declare War with your whole worthless Sex be you alone excepted from my general Resentment I wish you that soft Repose which has been this Week past a Stranger to  Your own Fanny  LETTER XXV  Dear  FANNY  TAKE Notice that this Letter is dated the th of  April    Old Stile  that you may see how punctual I am in answering your's For by your saying I was a Fortnight silent I suppose  Tom  forgot my Letter in his Pocket and I was really just sitting down to inquire what was become of you when I received your's I assure you I never suffer a Post to intervene between our Correspondence and I will date my Letters henceforward to convince you of it  I am sorry you are illI am not much better myself and am reduced to such a Degree of low Spirits as I should be ashamed to own but that I never disguise my Foibles to you I hope it is owing merely to my Disorder that your  Letter appears very unreasonable and unkind but that and other Matters be referred to our Meeting which shall be as soon as I am able to ride up to Town and tho' you stint me the Pleasure of your Company to Half an Hour I shall find nothing new in that for I never thought I had that Happiness longer in my Life  I thank you for the Trouble you have had about my Things and have here sent you a Bill for the Costs I have not seen them yet but am resolved to like them except the Green you have chosen be a Willow which from your Letter I have Reason to apprehend  I may hear from you once at least before I shall be able to set out and hope to have a better Account of your Health to know when you have fixed for your Journey and whither you are going  Adieu I am Your's in Sickness or in Health  LETTER XXVI  My dear  HARRY  I AM extremely sorry to hear that you are ill either in Body or Mind and I sincerely wish that my present Sympathy could alleviate your Pains for I could with Pleasure say  Ah more than share themgive me all thy Griefs  I took the Air three or four Times in a vile Hack and this has encumbered me with two new Disorders a Cold and ToothAch I have quite lost my Appetite and oh how long are the Nights and how short my Slumbers I am quite feeble and my Spirits so low that I can hardly speak to give necessary Directions about myself and you know what a helpless Family I am in Oh haste thee quickly to my Aid and bring  Hygea  with thee more welcome as alone enjoyed in thy loved Presence and admired Converseat least oh send me a Ray of Divinity in your next Letter by telling me you are recovered  You call my last Letter unreasonable and unkind and say you are preparing the Willow If to esteem you with unwearied Constancy and to preserve the strongest Friendship for you even tho' you do not merit it can be called unkind tho' I acknowledge it to be unreasonable I shall then own your Charge is just Yet notwithstanding all this Weakness in my easy Nature I am determined not to see you but for the Time I proposed and I hope to have Courage enough to keep a Resolution upon which perhaps the Happiness of my Life depends  My Head is so bad that I am hardly able to hold it down any longer tho' I have ten thousand Things to say but if I am able I will write again by next Post  I beg you will let me know when you intend to be in Town for I have a Question to ask you which is of some Consequence to my Repose  And oh what anxious Minutes count they e'er  Who doat yet doubt suspect yet fondly love  Do not ask me what it is for I will not tell you 'till we meet  Farewel Farewel  Frances  LETTER XXVII  My dear  FANNY  I AM very sorry for the Account you give of yourself and is it not at the same Time an extraordinary Thing that I should wish it were all true For I would rather you had real than imaginary Ills as one is much easier cured than the other and I have often had Reason to suspect you of Spleen and Vapours before now  I am quite recovered and design going to  London  in ten Days but think it needless to carry  Hygea  with me "Nec Deus intersit c" for you possess her already and bear her about as  Minerva  was born of  Jupiter  's Brain  Jupiter  did of old for  Hygea  is but one of the Names of  Minerva    As soon as I get to Town I shall wait upon you to talk over your extraordinary and cruel Scheme of banishing me from your Presence for ever and as to the Question you mean to ask me I will lay open my Heart and Mind as freely to you in any Particular you have a Curiosity to inquire into as I would to Heaven "from whom no Secrets are hidden" for indeed I know nothing merely relative to myself which I need or would chuse to conceal from you and for what concerns other People you can have no Reason to be anxious  I am  my dearest bestloved Girl  Your constant and bestloving  Lover  LETTER XXVIII  I AM extremely pleased to find that my dear  Harry  has neither forgot his Promise nor his  Fanny  You see my Pulse keeps equal Time  with your's I wish I could say they made as healthful Musick However you may be assured your Letter has been the most efficacious Medicine I could possibly have met withAs the Mind has often an Effect upon the Body to its Detriment which you hint to be my Case it is but fair it should also have the same towards its Good and as there has been a Sympathy between us in Sickness it would be a provokeing Circumstance if it did not continue in Health  Forgive me if I am laconick Tonight for I write in a Room where there are as many different Tongues as the Apostles were inspired with tho' I think the Allusion would have been juster if I had mentioned the Building of  Babel    I thank you for your refined Compliment which tho' I have not Vanity enough to give Credit to I am however pleased at as I am with any Thing which gives you an Opportunity of shewing that lively Wit which is elegant even in Trifles and perhaps that Passage in your Letter was designed as a Supplement to the  In Praise of Folly  Moriae Encomium  of  Erasmus    A Wellbred  young Man threatens to read my Letter so I will close it to save you from the Scandal of having so stupid a Correspondent  LETTER XXIX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I HAVE been abroad about Business these two Days tho' not very well able to go and am just returned to  Belvidere  which I call coming to myself again and the first Thing which occurs to me of Course must be the applying myself to you  Your Letter was as you say laconick but I should have thought so if it contained a Quire of Paper However I kissed your last Billet as it was in some sort an Emblem of yourself short and sweet  I sincerely wish there was such a Sympathy between us as you hint at of mutual Affections and Passions but all the Effect I feel is like what is perceivable in Iron touched by the Loadstone I am sensible of an Attraction but alas my Needle points still to the  North  which is the Region of your Chastity  I will make my Letter as short as your's to shew you I can keep to a Pattern tho' I have not been able to put as good Stuff in the Suit  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XXX  Dear  HARRY  Ripton  BECAUSE a Surprize is an agreeable Novelty in this same  repetitious  World I would not give you the least Hint of our intended Frolick  Kitty  and I set out on  Tuesday  Morning for this Place which we reached much fatigued that Night partly by Stage and partly Horses which her Brother brought to meet us at which Town was all in Flames as we passed thro' it but our Virtue carried us safe thro' the Fire  Ordeal    Direct for me at for we shall be all next Week at the Assizes which are expected to be very gay I have often thought this a very odd Time for Diversion and that a Jury shall now pass a Verdict of Death and then go dance There is also a Sort of Cruelty in it to the miserable Wretches who suffer Death or Banishment at such Times for the Weight of all Ills is increased by comparing ourselves with those who seem to rejoice in Health or Happiness  We shall return to  London  in ten Days  Adieu  LETTER XXXI  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I HAVE delayed answering your Letter 'till the Post is just going out that I might have as little Time to spare for that Purpose as possible lest I should answer it too fully and circumstantially therefore shall only say that if you will recollect yourself you will find that since the First of our Acquaintance there has not been an Act of Dishonour Unkindness or even the lowest Baseness to be imagined which you have not at several Times charged me with my Love my Friendship my Honour my Word my Oath all suspected And the highest and often repeated Testimonies of them all discredited  "Are these Things so" and are you surprized I should warmly expostulate about them Which was in Truth all I did in that Letter that has moved you to such intemperate Resentment  When I press you home about some Particulars in your former Letters you pretend to be in JestIs this ingenuous DealingWhen I invite a large Set of Company to pass the Summer at  Belvidere  merely to save Appearances in your coming you tell me you understand this but as a Pique of Honour But indeed  Fanny  if I had not more true Love for  you than I find I have Credit for the Caprice and Unreasonableness of your Behaviour in several Instances of our Lives would have left me no Necessity for preserving such a Pique  I shall say no more 'till we meet nor then I hope one Word upon this Subject for I believe Half an Hour's Reflection upon the Substance of this Letter will prevent all Occasion of such Altercation for the future  I am  my dearest  Fanny  notwithstanding the Mortifications I have met with    Your's indeed Henry  LETTER XXXII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    What is the Reason that you use me thus  But 'tis no Matter  Let  Hercules  himself do what he may  The  Cat  will mew and  Dog  will have his Day  IT is a provoking Thing that I have not any Person to whom I dare appeal upon a Difference or Dispute between us Yet it would avail me nothing if I had for that provoking insincere plausible philosophick Temper  of yours would prejudice any Judge in your Favour In short the Reasonableness of my Resentment cannot always appear but the Calmness of your Anger may for while I am raging like one bit by a mad Dog you are looking as demure and wise as a Physician feeling a Pulse Thus superficial Observers are imposed upon but the Searcher of Hearts would find mine all the Time overflowing with Tenderness and Goodnature your's rendered callous by deliberate Malice and calm Rancour  I know you will be angry at this but so you have  pleased  to be with almost every second Letter I ever wrote to you and every second or third Conversation has been a Quarrel  I find we are both apt Scholars at a Game they call  SnapDragon  but it shall not be my Fault if we do not leave off before we have burnt our Fingers therefore for the Sake of Peace and Friendship let our Correspondence end here  Adieu  Frances  LETTER XXXIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    YOU began your last with a Quotation which aptly describes the Life we have led for some Time past but that I think our's is more unaccountable for tho' a  Dog  and  Cat  begin with Squabbling yet Use soon reconciles them to each other and I have seen them in a short Time quietly occupy each a ChimneyCorner as becomes domestick Animals to do While on the contrary we met at first with that mutual Love and good Liking which might promise a long and constant Harmony yet were not one Month acquainted before  Puss  in her Majesty had her Back up and  Curr  fell a Snarling as if Use Habit or Custom whose constant Strife is against Nature made a Sport of reconciling Antipathies and destroying Sympathies  But to quit this Allegory I beg my Dear you will consider that I never reprimanded you for any Thing but what I thought some Injury to your Fortune Character or Health mostly the Last for the First is too small for Oeconomy and the Second too good for Scandal But you are constantly complaining of bad Health and yet always doing the very Things which destroy it you are eternally taking Medicines  and at the same Time doing irregular Things to prevent their Operation Now it is probable that there are but few Drugs in an Apothecary's Shop which may be said if they do no Good to do no Harm so that you may find the best Medicines without a Regimen turn to Poison and tho' frequent Parties to  Ranelagh  may be extremely agreeable to the Rules of a Novelthey are I assure you quite contrary to the Laws of Physick Such Irregularities or Excess of any Kind may not probably so soon as you imagine answer the End you have sometimes so wickedly wished for the End of Life but may perhaps take that shocking Turn I mentioned to you lately from an Hint of your Physicians who said you sometimes spoke like a Person who was going mad and with Regard to your Health you acted like one that was so  If from all these Apprehensions I should endeavour to exert perhaps a little too roughly the Power and Influence I thought I had over you and which I never will make Use of but for your own Advantage I was in Hopes of having the Reason and Nature of the Thing calmly and dispassionately considered and expected your Thanks tho' I acted not on so poor a Motive rather than your Resentment  But I have done and do here promise you that I will never give you any farther Offence  this Way for I find you will have no Regard to your Health for your own Sake and am afraid you have not Kindness enough to take Care of it for mine so I shall at least keep the Sentiments of my Heart to myself however I may be made uneasy with the Affections of it  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XXXIV  My dearest  FANNY  I VENTURED no farther than this Today for I had a great deal of Rain on the Road and was afraid to push on thro' the Night Air for the three Reasons I gave you this Morning as the sole Things which could make me uneasy at the Thoughts of Death I am now very well thank your asking have just dined and am drinking your Health  I thought with great Pleasure of your Meeting me at upon my Return but I do hereby release you from that Promise for coming by the House I saw even this bad Day three genteel Coaches two Hacks a PostChaise and two Fourwheeled Chairs unharnessed before the Door now it is possible and very probable that some Person in every one of these  Equipages know both you and me and the Pleasures I enjoy in your Love are not from open Vanity but secret Pride and  Like a good Conscience solid Joy supplies  Of which whoever could boast never knew the Sweets I would steal to your Love as Misers to their Wealth lest the Suspicion of it might tempt others to  where my Treasure is for there indeed my Heart is also  You see what a  Platonick  you have made me for I speak of intellectual Joys now as warmly as I used to do of the Pleasures of Sense But in short what I mean by all this is that since our Meeting at would not have the charming Consequences of such a frolick Appearance I should not chuse to act "Hypocrisy against the Devil" and leave the World Room to imagine me more happy than I am  At some Distance from this Town I amused myself with one of the most curious Pieces of exquisite bad Taste I have ever met with and which put me in Mind of that Epistle of  Pope  's which we read together the other Evening It was the  deceptio visûs  of a Ship in Sail on the Top of a Mountain which I suppose terminated the Visto of some absurd Fellow's Unimprovement thereabouts which shews Mistress  Johnson  's Expression  Improved for the better  hinted in one of your Letters tho' a Tautology in Sense not so much so in Terms This may be ranked among the  unnatural Pleasures I mentioned to you lately with which the Daemon of  Caprice  has possessed the human Brutes of this World The curious Artist too lest any of his Merit should be lost by the natural Appearance of the Object had placed it on the left Hand while the Sea was roaring on the Right that the paltry Contrivance might be obvious to the meanest Capacity or if there was any Design to deceive the View it was by fixing the Ship among a Parcel of horrid Rocks so that one might suggest to himself a shocking Object of Distress thrown up there by the Raging of a Tempest or the Violence of an Earthquake which but heighthened the Idea of false Taste and put me in Mind of several famous Pieces of Painting which have displeased me greatly such as Storms Battles Cities on Fire Executions chained Slaves  c  which I never could endure the Contemplation of for a Moment The only Thing which can recommend in such Pieces is their being well drawn but this only renders them still more shocking as a bad Man needs but Sense and Courage to be a Devil  There are some much admired Passages in Poetry which I am dissatisfied with for the same Reason and that a Relish for such Things is an Instance of false Taste I think may be deduced from this one Reflection that Providence  has so wisely and justly ordained it that nothing which gives us Pain can possibly give us Pleasure except overcoming the Distempers of the Body or the Vices of the Mind  Adieu  my dear  Moralist  and believe me  ever Your's Henry  LETTER XXXV  My Dear  FANNY  I DID not mean to trouble you about such a Trifle at a Time you were ill and only desired  Tom  to ask where you had bought the Silk that he might match the Colour Let me know what the Charge is that I may not owe you paltry Debts already so bound and mortgaged to you  I am extremely sorry any Thing in my Letter should provoke you or make you uneasy tho' I need not make any Apology for being guilty of an Error any body who knows you might be led into the Believing you never say or do any Thing without a Meaning or Design What I hinted at were Passages out of your own Letter and tho' upon my Honour I did not take them seriously I thought at least you meant to make me uneasy by them and  not having the Malice to disappoint the Design I thought it would be some Amusement to my little  SnapDragon  to find her Scheme was answered  You have a Right I think and a Power I swear to make me uneasy whenever you please and I shall henceforward never repine at your Prerogative but when you extend it as you often do to the cruel Height of rendering yourself unhappy in Health or Spirits which is a Method of wounding me beyond the Power of Temper or Philosophy  I am  my dearest  Fanny  because I would not help it if I could    Your's eternally Henry  LETTER XXXVI  WHEN my dear  Harry  left Town I flattered myself that I should enjoy  a cool Suspence from Pleasure and from Pain  and that I should recover my shattered Spirits and broken Constitution firmly resolved to live soberly quietly and righteously all the Days of my Life But see the strange Perverseness of my Stars more in Fault than I which drive me on the Rock I thought to shun for  I have not been one Evening at Home since I saw you but have been continually immersed in Noise Folly and Hurry dragged about in melancholy Parties of Pleasure where as  Pope  says  I sit with sad Civility I hear  With honest Anguish and an aching Ear  And surely it is a Vice which the Devil was not Fool enough to recommend to sacrifice one's Life and Health without some Joy in doing it I wish you had died three Years ago for if I had not known you the now insupportable Stupidity of Half the World would not have been so irksome to me for nothing is good or bad but by Comparison You will oblige me extremely if you will send me a Dissertation upon Fools why there should be such Difference between Men of the same Family and same Education as may frequently be observed and at the same Time explain to me the Cause for Reason there can be none why Women are generally so fond of them You must know that a Lady in  Queen  's  Square  whom you sometimes have heard me make whimsical Mention of has in one of her Flights taken a most unfortunate Passion for me and as Love is importunate she has not let me rest an Hour in Peace since that unlucky Aera tho' what I suffer from her is not the worst Part of the Adventure for the Oddness of her Character is  not unentertaining but she is generally surrounded by a Groupe of miserable young Men "of Wit and Humour about Town" who by the Way of being sprightly talk Nonsense by the Hour then by Way of Gallantry cram us into Hacks and away to where I have supped with the same Set twice this Week and  Woe is me  To have seen what I have seen seeing what I see  But now I think of it why did you not write last Post I confess indeed that your sprightly Letter had more fine Things in it than I should be able to pay you back in a thousand Years but to some the Gods have given Fortitude  c  and since Writing is not my Talent I think you would be more unreasonable than the  Aegyptian Taskmasters  if you expected a Return from me but to play back the Pertness of your own Expression in one of your Letters  You may be assured that my Heart at least keeps equal Time with your's tho' you may have more Wit as well as Love at your Fingers Ends  And tho' I cannot pay you off in your own Coin you may see by the Length of this Letter that I make you the only Tender I have in my Power and like a compounding Creditor you must accept of Quantity for Quality  We have dreadful Weather here long tedious wet Winterdays and short Nights which hardly give us Time to warm ourselves in Bed before the Ghost of  Phoebus  returns to haunt us with another uncomfortable Day The Streets are not much above Ancledeep which is an entertaining Circumstance to those who have no Equipages In short I am almost ruined with the Expence of Chairhire  I wish you could prevail on yourself to write oftener than once a Week for if I am reduced I vow I will print your LettersI think they will keep me in Tea clean Linnen and Plays which you know is all my Food my Apparel or my Amusement  Adieu and think often of Your affectionate  Pauper  LETTER XXXVII  My dear  PAUPER  I RECEIVED your pretty lively Letter and am now set down to consider of the Question you started in Natural Philosophy relating to Fools  As Nature is said to have made nothing in vain what Apology then for Fools This Difficulty which has so long puzzled the Learned  I will offer you two Solutions to answer one by denying and the other by admitting the Fact  First then I deny that Nature ever made a Fool but as she makes any other Monster not by Design but thro' some accidental Imperfection in the Organs of Conception or casual Event happening afterwards to the Infant in the Cradle  Next I admit Fools to have been made by Design and no Offence to you shall take the Liberty to offer you this Hypothesis of the Matter  Providence made Man and seeing it not good that Man should be alone made Woman then seeing it not good that Women should be alone he made a Fool before which Time it is said she amused herself with the Devil From which Time Knaves and Fools have divided the Favours of the Fair  Let me now attempt a Metaphysical Account of this extraordinary Matter which has so much surprized natural Philosophers That two Men who have had the same Education and upon Dissection have been found anatomically the same have yet so greatly differed in their Understanding For this see the  Metempsichosis  on Transmigration of Souls according to  Virgil  's Account of it He says in the sixth  Aeneid  that the Souls of those who die return to this  World again to animate other human Bodies except such as having compleatly acquitted themselves on Earth remain in  Elysium  for ever Now since as many or more are born as die therefore it is necessary to create a Number of new Souls to supply the Place of those who have finished their Course Thus I conclude that what is stiled Sense or Parts in Men is but a Recollection of former Experience and their having no Consciousness of this Matter need be no Objection to the Truth of it for Men have often in their Sleep exercised the Arts they have been bred to without any Recollection of their former Practice The Fools then of this World I take to be some of those newfashioned Souls occasionally created who must necessarily pass thro' an Infancy of threescore Years and be reborn to every Stage of human Life before they can arrive at an adult Understanding and find Rest for their Souls in  Elysium    The second Part of your Proposition must be deferred to be considered the next Post  I am  my fair Querist    Your faithful Respondent Harry  LETTER XXXVIII  IN Answer to the second Part of your Quere I shall observe to you that Fools are generally said to be  As I have not my Books by me I must leave this Section imperfect and proceed to another natural Reason which is that Thought and Reflection much waste the Strength and dissipate the animal Spirits which Weakness Fools being especially free from here again I am at a Loss so I shall quit this Subject after having made one Reflection that as Women are said in general to be extremely fond of Fools it is surprizing that Men of Sense find so little Favour from them as they are allowed to be incomparably the greatest Fools in Love For a Man of Sense must beat a Fool all to nothing even in Folly But this remarkable Distinction with Women must be owing to their extraordinary Piety paying greater Regard to Ideots delivered from the Hands of their Creator than to Fools of their own Making  Enough of this idle Subject  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XXXIX  FRANCES  to  HENRY    DOST thou expect to live after all this prophane Sarcasm against Women Or do you hope that  Hesiod  or  Orpheus  were to be the last Sacrifices to Female Justice Observe that I enter the Lists and draw my Pen as Champion for the Honour of my injured Sex in which I shall proceed after your own Method First by denying and then by admitting the Fact  First then I affirm that Souls are not of different Genders Therefore in the metaphysical Nature of the Question your Sex has originally no Advantage over our's I have indeed sometimes heard such an arbitrary Distinction made as Virtues masculine and Virtues feminine but the Antients who first classed all human Properties were of a different Way of thinking and tacitly confessed that all virtuous Qualities belonged more properly to our Sex for I have heard you say a very flattering Thing that  in all the learned Languages the moral Excellencies were Nouns of the feminine Gender  If you answer for  Greek  and  Latin  I will do the same for  French  and  Italian    This shews at least the general Sense of lettered Philosophers as also of great and warlike Nations in our Favour and what led them naturally into this Way of Thinking was the Observing that all Refinement in Sense and all Improvement in Manners was entirely owing to our Influence over your uncooth Natures who afterwards polished those Virtues which we first inspired"ye had been Brutes without us"  But not to insist on any Superiority in this Matter would it not be cruel and prophane to suppose that the Creator should require as great Virtues from us and subject us to as severe Trials as Men without inspiring our Minds with equal Strength or making our Souls capable of as high moral Perfection  Your own Reading can furnish you with Instances in Women of every manly Virtue even of personal Courage and Contempt of Death sufficient to prove the Force of my Reasoning which however I shall not enumerate lest my Memory failing me you should pertly say these Examples were but just sufficient to establish the contrary Rule by their Exceptions to it In Answer to which I shall make a Reply that a Lion did once to Man you "keep the Art of Painting in your own Hands" But grant that the Instances of female Heroism are but few are not the Opportunities of exerting  it as few also I mean with regard to Actions publick and shining enough for the Notice of History which however are neither more amiable or more difficult than many Virtues you vile Men give us the Occasion of exercising in private Life to which you have arbitrarily confined the Sphere of our Activity  Now even those few extraordinary Examples which you all admit of sufficiently prove or declare the original Excellence of our Natures for Reason or Philosophy may perfect Virtue but cannot create it tho' a narrow and illiberal Education may so depress and obscure great Qualities as to give that paltry Tenour to our Characters which you so unfairly reproach us withwhich brings me to the second Part of my Proposition and which according to your Example I shall make the Subject of a second Letterso a Truce 'till next Post but no Peace 'till you are fairly conquered  Farewel  F  LETTER XL  IN antient Times when Mankind began to frame themselves into Societies and States the male Part perceiving they were born with greater bodily Strength than the Female vainly concluded they were originally indued with greater Sense and nobler Souls so partially arrogated to themselves the Superiority at the same Time that they refused very unfairly the same Law of Reason to an Horse though they acknowledge him to be an Animal of greater Strength than they  Now in order to preserve this unjust Dominion to themselves and their Heirs Male for ever they concluded no  Salique  Law so effectual as to fetter and inslave our Minds by such a narrow domestick and partial Education as should bury the Seeds of Sense and Philosophy and byass our Opinions towards a Notion of their superior "manly Sense and Reason"  Thus uneducated and unimproved or what is worse condemned to a wrong Education it is as unfair to censure us for the Weakness of our Understandings as it would be to blame the  Chinese  Women for little Feet for neither is owing to the Imperfection of Nature but to the Cruelty of Custom  When Women then associate themselves with Men of moderate Understandings for I  think you too humble when you brand those with the Title of Fools who fall short of your own Sense it is only because it is natural and reasonable to prefer that Degree of Sense which they comprehend to that which is beyond their Apprehension and this is nothing more than you would do yourself for I do not know what Pleasure you could have in Company with a  Rabbi  merely for his understanding  Hebrew  of which you hardly know the Type  I believe that Women  caeteris paribus  as  Tom  says always prefer Men of the best Sense as far as the Limits of their own Understanding extend beyond which it would be Enthusiasm not rational Affection to carry their Regards I confess indeed that there must be an intire Equality between the Rivals with regard to Fortune Titles Dress Person  c  before the Superiority of Understanding can have the Chance of being considered But then this is owing to the false Byass of female Education which directs us to wrong Means of Happiness and instead of being censured for our Error we ought to be pitied for not being rendered capable of judging right  Henceforward therefore I interdict you wise Fools from the Unjustness of any Satyr against our Sex 'till you have by a proper and more liberal Education given our noble and ingenuous Natures fair Play to exert themselves  Do this if ye dare ye imperious Tyrants and ye shall see how small we will make you Oh let us once be free for know that Arts and Sciences cannot raise their Heads under despotick Sway  I shall mention but one Thing more which appears to me a very natural Thought that Providence certainly intended Women rather than Men for the Study and Contemplation of Philosophy and scientifick Knowledge as the Delicacy of our Frame seems fitter for Speculation than Action and our Homeprovince affords us greater Leisure than Men who from their robust and active Natures seem calculated more for Business Labour and mechanick Arts Out then ye vile Usurpers of our natural Rights and Liberties and oh for an Army of  Amazons  to vindicate our Wrongs  F  LETTER XLI  HENRY  to  FRANCES    Penthesilea  furens mediis{que} in millibus ardet  Bellatrix audet{que} viris concurrere  Virgo    There is more Latin for  Tom    I AM charmed at the Sense and Spirit of your Letters and find it easy to recant from an Error which was never seriously my Opinion  and you may forgive the Spleen of a provoked Lover who as is generally the Way abuses the whole Sex to shew his Resentment to one But I cannot help observing how generously and like a KnightErrant you have behaved to fly to the Succour of a weak Combatant by whose Fall you could no Way be affected  Since Satyrizing those is Praising you  To this you could not be induced by any State Policy to enter into an Alliance for your own Defence but like the  English  bravely ingage in the War to preserve the Ballance of  Power  and like them too furnish the whole Expence yourself  For my Part I declare that in general I both like and esteem Women better than Men they often excite the Exercise of the most pleasing Virtues Generosity Honour and Compassion they inspire us with the whole  petites Morales  as the  French  not unaptly term them of Complacency Politeness and Gentleness of Manners without which as you say we had been Brutes indeed  I never feel myself intirely chearful but in their Company for Sprightliness and good Humour more particularly become you than us as your gayer and more poetical Reading with almost an intire Vacation from Business enable you better to exert them In short what was said of Musick may very justly be applied to your Sex  Women  the Cordial of a troubled Breast  The softest Remedy that Grief can find  The gentle Spell which lulls our Cares to Rest  And calms the ruffling Passions of the Mind  Your Sense too is of a prettier and purer Kind than our's unincumbered with logical Distinctions and untainted with the Subtleties of the Schools "you strike each Point  c  "  Your Virtues also are more constant and perfect than our's as they flow from a natural Delicacy of Sentiment a chaste Education and a more implicit Sense of Religion while our Morals being first obscured by a libertine Youth are to be brought to Light by the Labour of Thought and Reflection then pass thro' the Hands of Legislators who so mix and blend them with human Policies that the very Spirit is evaporated or else they are so subtilized by the Refinements of the Philosophers that the intire Substance of Virtue is destroyed  I shall say no more now on this Subject but that as I formerly hated the whole Sex on Account of one Woman I shall henceforward love them all for the Sake of another in Consequence of which I here throw this Palinode at your Feet  Henry  I cannot resist a Piece of Pertness in Answer to the last Paragraph of your last Letter by observing that whether Knowledge was originally designed for Women or no I cannot tell but she certainly was the first who  tasted  of it  LETTER XLII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    ROCHFAUCAULT or some other Maximmonger has these Words  It is a common Thing with some People to exclaim against Inconstancy at the same Time that they are pleased to have an Example of Change for sometimes the warmest Love and strictest Friendship insensibly slacken and we then seek a Quarrel merely to have some Pretence to set ourselves at Liberty  This my dear  Fanny  seems really to be your Case for I'll be sworn there is not the least Colour in any of my Letters for such a Charge against me I have not found Fault because I would not wrong you with any of your Words or Actions I have not taken it into my Head that you seem tired of the Commerce between us either in Conversation or Correspondence nor have I ever sought a Pretence  to put an End to it So far from it that tho' you have so fairly say unfairly put one in my Way by your last extraordinary Epistle I will not take the Advantage of it tho' it has a Recommendation which could make me do almost any Thing else namely your Request  You desire too that I would return you all your Letters for indeed I have them all but this too I must refuse you for I should part even with your Writings with more Reluctance than it seems you would have in resigning mine and their Author too to help out the Bargain which I do not think an Equivalent for the Exchange you require and I am too poor in Wit to part with any Thing for less than its full Value tho' perhaps it would be but slightly prized if known how little I gave for it  Tho' I will not part with any Thing of your's you see how readily I give you what belongs either to myself or others I send you inclosed a Lock of my Hair which you desired when I saw you last and to pay the highest Compliment to female Vanity and Triumph I also send you a Locket to put it in which was given me by a very pretty Woman whose Hair I have taken out and burned this Day in the Midst of some of her Letters which I had by me  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XLIII  I RECEIVED my dear  Harry  's Letter and am much better pleased to acquit than condemn you for as somebody says I think it is  Pope    To say I have changed my Opinion is no more than to say I am wiser Today than I was Yesterday  I am doubly pleased to have my Knowledge increased by a Consciousness of your Regard but in Return for the Maxim you quoted give me Leave to use one of the same Author's where he says  That the Violence done us by others is often less painful than that we do ourselves  Now my dear  Harry  if this be the Case I am still unhappy in your Correspondence For be assured that my sole Motive for desiring to put an End to it was that I imagined it grew tiresome to you and it would mortify me extremely if I thought I owed more to your Goodbreeding than your Goodwill This Opinion of mine however did not proceed from any Suspicion of your Inconstancy but from a Consciousness that I had neither a natural or acquired Fund sufficient to return your charming and frequent Letters with that Sense and Spirit they required and if ever I neglected a Post it was from that Awe which has often made me silent in your Company But if you have indeed Condescension enough to read the Dictates of  my little artless Heart with a more than partial Eye if they sometimes give you Pleasure even of goodnatured Criticism and that you still regard me with friendly Opticks I wish no higher Satisfaction than the Continuance of your entertaining and improving Correspondence  It humbles me sometimes when I suspect that you only write to me as  Moliere  used to read his Works to his Housekeeper that he might be sure there was natural Wit in whatever was relished by her untutored Taste However your Condescension has any Way its Esteem with me and puts me in Mind of a beautiful Simile I have some where met quoted from the Antients  that a Man of Merit resembles an Ear of Corn which stoops the more it is loaded with Grain  I thank you for the Lock of your Hair but am angry at what you call a Compliment to female Vanity I assure you I do not feel any Joy in this shortlived Triumph but rather look upon it as a  Memento  Of that hard Fate which she must one Day prove  Who hopes from  Henry  's Vows eternal Love  Besides I should have set it in a more elegant Manner for your former Mistress seems to have had but an oldfashioned Taste but I will now keep it as it is for its own intrinsick Value  I should be tempted to send you a Locket to replace the one you have parted with but if Beauty could not keep its Situation near your Heart I fear you would not let any Thing which belonged to me have any Place about you nor even give it so honourable a Funeral as that of the antient  Romans  I wish however I could prevail with you to deal with my Letters as you say you have done with her's for I can't be easy while you have so many Proofs of my Folly in your Keeping  Adieu  Frances  Pray send me some more of your Poetry  LETTER XLIV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I AM very well pleased to find you are at length recovered to a right Way of thinking I swear you wronged me much if you really imagined I could any Way be tired of a Correspondence with you if you was kind enough to bless me with one in every Sense nor can I believe you had even the least Suspicion about it but had a Mind to make a farther Essay of my Fondness for you like People who rise to go away in order to be pressed to stay These are my dear  Fanny  idle romantick  Experiments and I beg you'll never make Use of them again as they suit not with my Sincerity and Plainness  As to the Sacrifice I made you it was neither out of Inconstancy or Ingratitude but she has been married some Years and lives very happily so I burned her Letters and destroyed her Bracelet because I did not care to keep any Thing of her's which might at any Time give Cause of unjust Suspicion or give me Occasion to recollect any Thing about her By which Means I thought to acquit myself with Honour both to her and you  The Inclosed I wrote the other Day upon my Friend's Illness which I should not think worth sending you if I had not received your Commands last Post to this Effect  Adieu  my Pett  write often and oftener  Henry  When first  Amyntor  caught Disease  My sympathizing Heart  Could taste no Joy 'till he had Ease  But felt an equal Smart  Far greater were my Griefs than theirs  Who wretched Exiles live  Sincerer were my silent Tears  Than hopeless Lovers give  A Home or Mistress all may find  And only Fools despair  A wise Man's Love is unconfin'd  His Home is ev'rywhere  But one sincere and faithful Friend  Is the best Gift of Heaven  And all his Wishes there should end  To whom that Bliss is given  LETTER XLV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THERE is something very provoking in your last Letter which I have observed in several others upon like Occasions and in short there is in your whole Behaviour towards me something which often distresses me to the highest Degree You first say or do some rude slighting or unkind Thing to me and when I resent it by Speech or Letter you throw yourself into your provoking Calmness and are Master of so much Politeness Address and Power of Countenance that you almost persuade me it was impossible for you to offend Which is somewhat like the Archness of an Academick who when he has burned your Fingers will give you Logick to prove there is no Heat in Fire which tho' it amuses does not not prevent  your Smarting and when I think to relieve myself by complaining to others they do not believe me against such Gentleness of Manners and specious Shew  In the History of  Reynard  the  Fox  there is a Story told That once upon a Time all the Beasts of the Field rose in Arms against our Hero on Account of some Rogueries charged upon him which they thought brought a Disgrace on their Bruteships But when they came to his Den they found him reading his  Credo  and concluded the Information to be malicious When  Nero  was seen playing on his Harp who could have thought it was he who had just fired the City  In short my dear  Harry  I wish you would resolve to be either an Angel or a Devil for you can be either and preserve Constancy in your Option because this Suspence you hold me in is the most uneasy State in the World as I cannot determine on any certain Scheme of loving or hating you So I shall conclude at present with a Tag from one of  Martial  's Epigrams  There is no Living with you or without you  Adieu  Frances  LETTER XLVI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THERE is no News in this Town but what to be sure you have heard before that is gone off with I pity her extremely for as she is very pretty and very young she has probably a long and shocking Scene to go thro' Had she erred with any other Man she might have the common Excuse of being deceived of a Dependance upon his Honour  c  But she abandons herself to the  ilest Infamy  Who swells the Triumph of known Perjury  If a Woman is tempted to forfeit her own Character she ought at least to take Care that the Man has some Character to lose so as tho' she becomes a private Victim she shall not be made a publick Sacrifice If I was to do an Act which I could not justify to the World I would at least take Care to have something to excuse me to myself But poor Miss has nothing of all this to palliate her Indiscretion for she has as  Young  movingly expresses it  Set out to Sea upon a shatter'd Plank  And puts her Trust in Miracles for Safety  I feel a mortified Pride and Indignation upon all Occasions like this as I suppose you Men do when you hear the Story of a Coward lest  it should bring a Reflection upon human Nature in general for Custom tho' not Ethicks or Religion has put Courage in your Sex and Chastity in ours upon the same Footing How inequitable a Law that is may be proved from this one Consideration That you have but seldom any Occasion of exerting your imaginary Point of Honour while poor weak Women may have every Day an Enemy to combat either within or without and sometimes hard Fate may be attacked by both at once  Some  French  Writer says  Qu'elle est a plaindre qui à au meme témps L'amour et la Vertu  but I say more justly  Qu'elle est a plaindre qui à que L'amour seulemen  ▪  I am ashamed at having ceded so much in this Argument but there is no disguising our Sentiments to you Natural Philosophers and to those who are acquainted with the Frame of human Nature I think it prudent to own the Truth lest our Actions might be deemed as disingenuous as our Words which puts me in Mind of a very just Remark of your's upon a certain Occasion  That none but Cowards ever denied their being liable to Fear  And it was a noble Saying of  Turenne  to one of his Generals who took Notice of an extraordinary Emotion he observed in him the Morning just before a desperate Engagement "This  Cowardbody trembles at what the brave Soul dares this Day"  I shall take Care to forward the Letters you inclosed to me last Post and think they are wrote with that Sense and Virtue which is so familiar to you as to appear in your most ordinary Actions I am fond of your good Wishes for their Happiness as you justly limit it to their Merits had you given them one Grain more I should have been extremely angry as it would have been impiously presuming to be more merciful than God himself However not to make too severe a Law against myself I hope you will not deal so  Debtor  and  Creditor  like with  Your very sincere and affectionate Fanny  LETTER XLVII  Monday  Morning o'Clock  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I AM just returned from performing my usual  Ambarvalia  in the Morning and have roused all my Labourers to Work except those who are ill whom I have visited and assisted both with Advice and Money Sometimes  when I take these Rounds I mend a Fence drive Cattle out of their Gardens and do many such little benevolent Offices which are extremely pleasing in the Exercise and flatter my Mind too as if I was a Sort of Guardian Angel assisting unseen and watching over those that slept  When I am as it were alone awake among the Brute Creation I feel myself like  Adam  sole Lord of this Globe and this Reflection cautions me from his Example  to take Heed lest I fall  In short I have often looked upon early Hours to be as necessary to Virtue as they are to Health for I believe most Men are wicked rather for Want of Reflection than Want of Principle and the charming Leisure which Rising early affords for Contemplation I take to be a great Help towards the Improvement both of Morals and Religion How natural is true Devotion when the Mind is at Liberty to reflect with Gratitude and Admiration upon the Bounties and Beauties of Providence and I am very sure that the Seducer has infinitely more Power over a Man immersed in the World than over one who has secluded himself from it insomuch that I never knew a very contemplative Man a wicked one since I have been capable to observe upon the Manners of Mankind It is in such Retirement that the Conscience has fair Play to exert itself and  that a Man has Leisure as it were to con over his Lessons of Philosophy Morality and Religion before he is called upon to repeat them when the School of the  World  is met by which Means he must be more perfect in his Part as he will have an Opportunity of getting it by Heart before he has Occasion to put it in Practice  Oh lost to Virtue lost to manly Thought  Lost to the noble Sallies of the Soul  Who think it Solitude to be alone  Communion sweet Communion large and high  Our Reason Guardian Angel and our God  Then nearest these when others more remote  And all e're long shall be remote but these  Young  's Night Thoughts  LETTER XLVIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    YOUR Thoughts upon the Nature and Passion of Resentment are philosophical and ingenious and are wrote with that sensible Calmness which I always admire in you tho' I am sometimes provoked at it In short I have often thought it was your peculiar Happiness to have been blessed by Providence with a Judgment to direct you right and an Heart to  pursue its Dictates for you really do not seem to be born with a Spirit sufficient to actuate your Virtue without it  But in Answer to your last Letter I think I may observe this that you seem rather to argue against the Passion of Anger than the Principle of Revenge That we are to submit to the Vicissitudes of Fortune with Chearfulness and Resignation as they are presumed to be the Dispensations of Providence who knows both what we are able and what it may be for our Advantage to bear is a Point we are both agreed in but whether we are to look upon those Misfortunes which proceed from the Ingratitude Perverseness Envy Hatred or Malice of Mankind as the Chastisement of Providence so as to consider our Enemies as evil Agents directed to good Purposes as Divines tell us is sometimes the Case is a Doctrine which does not appear quite so plausible to my Understanding Why may we not suppose that human Frailty or the Instigation of the Devil sometimes prompts Men to Enmity with their Fellowcreatures tempting them to communicate some Portion of that Misery to others which the evil Spirit of Mischief torments their own Hearts with In this Case then I look upon Revenge to be not only Natural but Moral too for the Disappointment of Malice or the Retorting of it with  Vengeance is a more likely Method of curing the vicious Habit than Nonresistance and Forgiveness which but nourish the Distemper  Your Sentiment  That we should behave well to our Friends out of Love and to our Enemies out of Picque  is certainly very noble but give me leave to observe that this is but a partial Virtue as it regards intirely our own Advantage but tends not to the Reformation of another's Manners This may have an Effect perhaps upon some ingenuous Natures but of such our late Letters have not been conversant and in Truth they are so few that this can only be considered as a particular not a general Rule  I may be wrong in my Opinion but Nature never errs and as the Brute Creation is inspired with such a Passion we may stile it the second Principle as Selfpreservation is the First and I dare say that  Seneca  dying in the Bath would have smiled in his last Moments to have seen  Nero  pale and breathless at his Feet Perhaps too it was some Idea of Revenge on  Caesar  that prompted  Cato  to put himself to Death otherwise he acted very unaccountably to disappoint the Conqueror's Triumph and to draw off the Acclamations of the World in secret Murmurs at their Hero's Fate However to compound this Dispute upon Revenge I will agree with you that as a Passion  it is a Vice provided you will admit that as a Principle it may be a Virtue  Adieu  F  LETTER XLIX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    THANKS to your Enquiry I am much better in Health and Spirits than I was Yesterday which I attribute chiefly to your Visit If you really have any Thing to say as you hint in your Letter are you like a Spright not able to deliver it 'till you are first spoken to I wish you would only give me the Clue that I may be able to trace your Labyrinth For I am not ingenious enough to unriddle your Meaning without it In short my Dear you have so speculated away your Senses that one must have the intuitive Science of an Angel to converse with you by the Intelligence of Souls  As for the Antithesis of your Regards for me it is no other Ways to be accounted for but by supposing that you have either imposed on me or yourself If you ever loved  me you do so still I need not add that you have more Reason for it now if Reason has any Thing to do in such Affairs If you never loved me you are only grown indifferent to me and being ashamed to own it as that is a State which Lovers never come to you pretend to hate me  Pray who are those Friends you hint at who have merited more from you than I None indeed thou Child of Fantasy and Caprice except by greater Merits you mean more personal Worth and in this Particular I must confess myself the meanest of your Admirers tho' the sincerest of your Friends You have certainly a very whimsical Manner of playing with my Passion for you and after the Kindness and Condescension of your Visit Yesterday I confess myself surprized at the Unaccountableness of your Letter this Morning I shall do myself the Pleasure of waiting on you this Evening and if I have the Happiness of meeting you alone and at Leisure enough I design to have some Conversation with you farther upon this Subject  Adieu  ma Bizarre  Henry  LETTER L  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I AM extremely obliged to you for your sprightly Poem there is an uncommon Fancy in it which pleases me and it is something of this Stile in your Character which attaches me so remarkably to you for were you but like the best of other Men you might find me oftener yawning in your Face as I do at them The only Variety I find in the Circle of my Acquaintance is in the Cornet who is grown so lively of late that as  Bayes  says he has "elevated and surprized me" and as a Man of Gaiety without a Mistress is in the Opinion of the Town no Man at all he has bethought himself of throwing his Devoirs at my Feet and taking Advantage of your Absence proceeds with so much unwonted Gallantry that your poor  Iphigenia  may be in Danger of being smitten by her  Cymon  or like  Pygmalion  become enamoured of a Statue of her own inlivening  Perhaps you are very little concerned about all this Danger and lest you should lead the Way in the high Road of Inconstancy I think it would be prudent to take  Prior  's Advice  Change thou the first nor wait thy Lover's Flight  Besides it is a good Maxim that they who are first cured are best cured which I hope is pretty much my Case Thanks to some Part of of your late Behaviour which has been the most efficacious Medicine and perhaps the only one which could possibly advance my Recovery so far I am your much obliged Debtor  I wrote to you last  Tuesday  but was then so much in the Elegiack Strain that I fear it was a dismal penned Piece I am not much in a gayer Mood at present than at that Time but why should I complain where I can hope for no Redress but merely to have my Griefs insulted by Philosophick Lectures  Indifference clad in Wisdom's Guise  All Fortitude of Mind supplies  It is easy for us to bear what we do not feel and they are best capable to give Advice who are not  concerned  However I cannot help acknowledging the Generosity of your Behaviour upon such Occasions for surely it is kind to take even so much Trouble in Matters where you seem to have no Sort of  Interest    Adieu  my dear  Stoick  Your's Fanny  LETTER LI  I AM extremely sorry for the Disorder you complain of as I know your Frame delicate and your Constitution tender your present State of Health is indeed a proper Apology for your Lowness of Spirits but at the same Time a strong Reason for your exerting them to the utmost  As for the Gentleman who you say has attempted in some Particularities as the Phrase is to take me off I beg you in Return will present him with my Thoughts upon his Pantomime Art in the following Essay  If Fools are not the only Mimicks they certainly are the best in the World for having no Characters of their own they can with more Ease adopt another's like the Cameleon which has no Colour itself and is reported to catch the Hue of any Object near it  To shew the Trivialness of this Art Children are observed to be the most natural Mimicks and a Girl in Leadingstrings will shew you how Mama and how Dada dances or takes Snuff  Even in mimick Life where one should expect this Practice to be in most Esteem among Stageplayers the Mimick is held among the lowest Class for in the same Proportion as  the representing the Excellencies of human Nature is the noblest Part so is ridiculing its Foibles the meanest  A Buffoon who values himself upon this  Imperfection  has the same Pride with a Baboon who itself the most ridiculous Animal in the whole Creation is notwithstanding the highest  Caracatura  upon the human Species  Adieu  LETTER LII  MY dear  Harry  may see by the Quickness of my Dispatch the Pleasure I take in obeying his Commands for tho' I have not any Thing to say yet I should think it a Breach of them to omit a Post But not to take more Merit upon me than I deserve I will honestly own that Selflove dictates most of my Letters and I undergo the Fatigue of writing many a tedious Page in order to purchase a few Lines from you "Point de Rose sans Pique" and am as well pleased with the Exchange as the  French  and  Spaniards  have Reason to be with their Traffick to the  Indies  where they purchase Gold and Jewels by Toys and Baubles  I was a great deal worse when I wrote last than I owned at that Time for I apprehended an  Inflammation on my Lungs which I was in Hopes would have proved mortal  For I am weary of this earthly Clay  Want higher Joys and long to wing away  My Reason for not telling you was because I was unwilling to anticipate your Pleasure on the Occasion besides when People are surprized they generally make a Simile and tho' I could not be sensible of what you might have said I have too much Regard to Posterity to prevent their Profiting by your Wit I am still as ill as a violent Cough Shortness of Breath sore Throat and Lowness of Spirits can make me and yet I am mightily afraid I shall recover and so I suffer to no End but to make me despise Life still more if possible  I assure you this is not Raillery for I was so serious as to make my Will and left you every Thing in Life which I thought valuable I chiefly mean your own Letters for alas I have little else that is worthy of your Acceptance  Farewel my dearest  Harry  living or dying  I am eternally Your's F  LETTER LIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED two Letters from you last Post of different Dates and find you are returning again to the  Melpomene  Strain and are as great a Riddle as ever You trifle with yourself very idly for sure if Life is not worth your Care Health is I felt your Disorder before I heard of it for I have been in the same Way myself for some Time past I am sorry to find the Sympathy of our Bodies so greatat this Distancebut I find the Sphere of your Activity is very extensive nay more powerful than any of the fixed Stars because you can influence as far as you are capable of being contemplated But no more of your malign Aspects and I beg that all your future Letters may be wrote in a chearful Strain tho' it should be even a  Strain  to youforgive the Quibble for be assured that nothing keeps off either natural or moral Evils so well as Chearfulness somebody calls it  the Health of Virtue  And I will not venture to carry it so far as to pronounce that a Man who is not chearful is either a Knave or a Fool Take Notice that all Distempers sooner seize on us when we are lowspirited and all ill Luck  and Misfortunes afflict the coward Mind more than the Brave Chearfulness I take to be the best Hymn we can offer up to our Creator as it shews Gratitude and Acquiescence while Melancholy betrays Repining and Despair at the Ways and Dispensations of Providence It is a Degree of the greatest Crime Man can be guilty of Suicide and the greatest Degree of it too for Deliberation is the highest Aggravation of a Crime  One of the strongest Articles of Guilt too instanced in the Crime I mention is the depriving the Society of a Member by how much more then the Victim's Merit is by so much greater must the Destroyer's Sin beThink of this and tremble  Henry  LETTER LIV  Dear  HARRY  I HOPE you have before this received my congratulatory Epistle on the Day that gave you Birth and I think I ought to condole with you now for having entered into the oldfashioned Scheme of Housekeeping I thank you for your obliging Wish but am angry with you for suspecting that I should be  tired of the Place for I could say with  Cowley    With thee for ever I in Woods could rest  Where never human Foot the Ground has prest  Thou from all Shades the Darkness can'st exclude  And from a Desert banish Solitude  So much by Way of Answer to the civil Part of your Letter but I confess I am quite at a Loss to know what Return to make to the Remainder of it I have so often spoke my Sentiments upon such Occasions that I have scarce any Thing left to say but Repetitions which I am not fond of upon so ungrateful a Subject  If I knew any Method to convince you I am serious and resolved in what I say I would upon my Honour attempt it with the greatest Pleasure tho' it were parting with a Limb as it would thenceforward save you a great deal of needless Trouble and me from a World of Anxiety and Mortification This might perhaps give such a Turn to your Regards for me as I could wish or prevent your ever thinking of me at all even which I should prefer to your thinking of me as you do I should then be at Liberty to love you without hating myself because I should then have an Esteem for you which might justify my Passion  I shall only add that if you have a Mind to convince me you desire either to see or hear from me again you will never mention so unkind so ungenerous and so unmannerly a Subject more for I shall never answer another Letter of your's wrote in such a Stile which if you sometimes use to shew your Wit you have no Excuse for as your Fund does not require the Aid of Libertinism  That I do love you I own and confess it more freely since I find I have thank God sufficient Strength to acknowledge it with Safety for I am glad to find I do not love you better than myself and tho' I would chearfully sacrifice all that is perishable of me for your Happiness I shall take Care to preserve that Part of me which may make you at some Time of your Life not ashamed of having loved me In short if you bear any Affinity to that Omnipotence which accepts a contrite Heart you cannot meet a more sincere Devotee but if you are like one of those Heathen Deities which required an human Sacrifice I declare I have no Offering for your Altar  Frances  LETTER LV  Dear  HARRY  THO' you have ventured upon that same Subject again yet you have done it with so much Address that I need not hold any Resolution of not answering your Letter The sudden Change in your Morals I confess surprizes me but too prompt Converts they say are seldom sincere and it must be a Goose indeed that is not aware when a Fox preaches  Now I think even your former Letter more tolerable than this for there you declared open War here you would circumvent and it would humour my Pride rather to be overpowered than to be overreached What you propose would do well enough for a Woman who only waited for an Excuse But in my Opinion this would only mend the Matter like Hypocrisy added to Vice or at best a Sort of don't know as it were neither this nor that nor one nor t'other nor good nor bad but hanging like  Erasmus  's Paradise between Heaven and Hell without Vice enough to repent of or Virtue sufficient to boast of Away away I'll ha' none on't I'll ha' none on't  I am not so unreasonable to take it ill that you do not offer what I know is not at present within your Power and Prudence but I have really great Reason to resent that you should attempt to offer me any Thing short of it  You rally me very unfairly upon what you call my  Platonicks  For I never pretended to carry Affectation to such a ridiculous Length so that I only declare myself a  Platonick  in Virtue not in Romance  Your Scheme is perhaps a very plausible one for the World if I should have Occasion  To tell them by and by how the Rogue served me  But notwithstanding there is wanting to me a certain Selfconviction without which all your Sense and Logick serve only to puzzle the Will not to determine it  You have without Doubt a very extraordinary Art which I never perceived in any other Person and which it is impossible for me to describe without a Paradox it is a Faculty of convincing the Reason without satisfying the Mind I know beforehand your ready Answer to this that it shews People's Prejudices stronger than their Reason But be it so for mewhen Prejudices are on the safe Side it is a Virtue to listen to them and I have just now luckily recollected an admirable  Sentiment I heard you once quote from some antient Ethicks  That we should never venture upon any Action where we have the least Doubt about its being honest or dishonest for this very Doubt declares at least our own innate Consciousness about it which is higher and prior to Logick and Casuistry  This and such other good Things has my dear  Harry  often said read and wrote to me for when you are not on your Guard I have often  detected  you to be a Man of Honour and Virtue and whenever you appear otherwise I am convinced that it is more the Vice of the Times than of the Man which was the Apology made for the Puns of  Shakespear  Indeed I tremble often to think how my dear  Harry  may be "beaten with many Stripes"  I have burned your last and former Letter upon this Subject lest they should ever happen to appear to the Disadvantage of your Character or to the Prejudice of mine  I would have preserved the Wit of them if I had been Chymist enough to separate the Gold from the Dross but they perished together in the Flames the natural Consequence of keeping bad Company  Adieu  Frances  LETTER LVI  I HOPE my dear  Harry  will excuse my Selfishness when I honestly confess that I am better pleased his Negligence should be owing to almost any Cause than his Forgetfulness of me Do not infer from this that I am unconcerned at your Illness for indeed I have felt it severely and Doubt has added a thousand Fears which I hope will never exist but in my tortured Fancy and surely your Neglect of Writing could not be worse timed for I really wanted something to support my Spirits in the Scene of Sorrow I have gone thro' since we parted Were I to repeat the Circumstances which have happened I dare say your good Nature and Generosity would be shocked therefore I shall be silentlet it suffice to tell you I have suffered dearly for my Indiscretion and "as to mention is to suffer Pain" I shall continue this Subject no farther If you are curious  Tom  can give you all the Particulars who has behaved with great good Nature in the Affair and I would not have mentioned it at all to you if I did not suspect that he would do it himself tho' I had his Promise he would not  My Aunt is still ignorant of your having been in Town But I fear will not long be so  as there wants only this to compleat the Affair But this and all other Ills vanish when I compare them to the Loss of your Life which I had Reason so lately to apprehend or to the Loss of your Love which I live in constant Apprehension of You desire me to write often to amuse you but my Letters are a slight Return for the Pleasure of yours tho'  Sappho  says  The less my Sense the more my Love appears  Which by the Way is no great Compliment to that Passion at least this is not such a Passion as you are capable of inspiring However I have often doubted of your own Tenderness from the Opinion I have of your Understanding and have sometimes asked myself  From whence do all his soft Expressions come  Sure not from Love for that they say is dumb  But such a Passion may I never prove  Give me a speaking and a writing Love  A Man that does with Eloquence persuade  And justifies the Fondness of a Maid  Adieu  P S  Upon Recollection I beg that if  Tom  has not mentioned the Affair to you you will not write to him about it and you shall hear it  all from me when we meet I have a Reason for this which did not occur to me when I gave you Leave to ask him  I sent off the Things you desired me to buy by I hope you got them safe and approved my Choice and Bargains  LETTER LVII  My dear  FANNY  LAST Post I received yours in Answer to mine from and I assure you the Hints you gave me of some Uneasiness you suffer at present lay me under the same Circumstances and more so because I cannot guess what it is which affects you  Tom  not having mentioned a single Word of it to me as you apprehended and has so far proved himself a better Confidant to you than a Friend to me Now I must insist upon it that you will give me a full Account of this Matter in your next Letter and not keep me any longer in Suspence on that Condition and no other I will not inquire about it from  Tom  nor shall I ever mention a Circumstance relating to it to any Person living if there be any Thing in the Story which requires being kept secret As to my State of Health which you are so kind to  be anxious about I am I think growing better every Day tho' but slowly I am however pronounced by the Physicians to be out of Danger and am resolved never to fall again except at your Feet I have discharged my Doctors and Time shall be the only Physician I will make Us  of for the future to perfect my Cure for as he comes generally unsent for I may spare my Fees of which I happen to have less at present than even of Health Time has this in common with most Physicians that tho' he fails to cure his Patients he can give them an Opiate which quiets them 'till the Day of Judgment and how it may fare with us then Time only can shew  The Things you bought for me are not come to Hand yet which happens to be very inconvenient to me Your Neglect of sending them by Mr was the Occasion of this Mishap and "the Moral of the Tale I sing" that ill Luck must attend every Thing you do contrary to my Advice which brings me back to my first Subject and may give you a sufficient Hint not to delay informing me fully of what you allude to in your former Letter which that you may the sooner apply yourself to the Discharge of I shall trespass no longer on your Leisure but conclude what I shall never otherwise conclude except with Life  Your sincere and affectionate Lover and your Friend  LETTER LVIII  Dear  HARRY  LAST Post brought me the pleasing Account of your Recovery surely some  Sylph  whose Charge I am contrived that it should then arrive even in the blackest Hour of all my Life when my Spirits were sunk to such an Ebb together with my own Uneasiness and Fears for you that nought within this sublunary Sphere but thou alone could raise them  Now give me Leave to tell you that nothing but the Joy I feel at your returning Health could make me bear the Remainder of your Letter with Patience if your Physicians had not pronounced you out of Danger I should have done it from your Writing in so peevish a Manner for you say of yourself and I have once or twice remarked it that when you are ill you feel more Tenderness Humanity and Goodnature about you than at any other Time which is contrary to the general Observation that Persons in Sickness Pain or Age even at those Seasons when they most stand in Need of the Comforts of Society and the Assistance of Friends do then more particularly and absurdly too contrive to deprive themselves of both by Illhumour and Perverseness  of Temper Perhaps Providence has wisely implanted this Weakness in human Nature to take off somewhat of the Concern we should otherwise be too sensible of for the Sickness or Death of our Friends or Parents which is something like the goodnatured Expedient I heard made Use of by a Gentleman who frequently retired to the Country to see his Father during his Vacation of Business at  London  and had a little Brother there who was so extremely fond of him as to cry for a Week after his Departure being informed thereof he ever after contrived to pick some Quarrel with the Boy the Morning he was to go away this succeeded so well that the little Fellow used to call for his Horses and cry  Well I am glad you are not to stay here another Day  But indeed I generally observe you scold me when you find me melancholy at least I perceive it more then as if I was a cross Child to be chid into good Humour If the Messenger neglected to deliver your Things I can't help it and as I thought mine the quicker Method of Conveyance I am no farther answerable for the Delay I shall not answer your Inquiry about the Matter I hinted at for if I had thought proper to write it I should have done so at first without waiting for your peremptory Commands and I must be for once as absolute as you in desiring that you will not mention  it to  Tom  Let it suffice to tell you that the Storm is now blown over and that Prince  Volscius  was the Person who raised it you shall know more when we meet if you rest content with this for the present  You did not tell me whether you would have the Callicoe Yard or Yard and half wide so I shall not buy it 'till you are more explicit lest you should please to be angry at another innocent Blunder of mine  Adeiu  LETTER LIX  Dear  FANNY  YOU rejoice me extremely by saying the Affair of Prince  Volscius  is blown over And I approve myself for my own Forecast as I own I suspected something relative to him in the MatterI perceive by Part of your Letter and by Recollection of several others that you are very fond of an Amusement the  French  call  faire Laguerre  and often imagine Unkindness in me for the Pride of forgiving it And indeed without some such Contrivance as this that noble Faculty in you could never have an Opportunity of exerting itself from any Occasion offered by me I only meant to rally you about the Disappointment of my Things which  I have since received safe and well approved of And wanted to tempt you to let me know the Affair you hinted at which you have not told me but I am easy because you say you are so I shall not call on  Tom  for any farther Explanation nor press you on that Head more 'till I see you and I am sorry to say that will not be so soon as I designed for I shall not be able to leave the Country this Fortnight yet on Account of some Business which has occurred since I wrote last The Callicoe is to be but Yard wide  My Health is almost established Thanks to your good Wishes I hope I may preserve it at our Assizes to which I am just summoned Health and Happiness attend my dear  Fanny  and take me in their Train  LETTER LX  Dear  FANNY  I Received yours and hope my last Letter will sufficiently explain the Mistake of the Post  I do assure you that you have no Rival at  Belvidere  but one which is at present sitting on the Table and endeavouring to snatch the Pen out of my Hand but according to the Fashion of the World you have nothing to apprehend  from her for she is not one I love but only one who loves me In short she has taken a most unnatural Affection to me for every other  Cat  in the House flies for it when I appear but  Sultana Puss  from a Kitten has sollicited my Regards followed me about the House and mewed at the Door when I was shut up in my Room She lay with me too for some Time 'till her Snoring disturbed me She is an odd Animal also in other Respects for she really is very low spirited sometimes and her Nerves are so weak which I attribute to her Drinking Tea in a Morning without Eating that the least loud Word sets her trembling so that I dare not chide an aukward Housemaid for Fear of putting Madam into one of her Hysterics I design taking her to Town with me for Advice of Physicians and perhaps a Creature which is reported to have nine Lives may at length find Benefit from their kill or cure Prescriptions  I have often laughed at the Simplicity of  Montaigne  playing with his Cat but shall henceforward accept him among the Philosophers  Mai Chere adieu  Et croyez vous  Que je suis  Sans contredit  Le plus fidele de vos Amis  LETTER LXI  I Am extremely glad to find my dear  Harry  a Votary to  Montaigne  he was always a Favourite of mine and I am greatly surprized that I never thought of introducing him in our epistolatory Conversations I know not whether he is numbered among the Philosophers but I think the very Amusement which you have copied from him speaks him a more practical one than any I have heard of For as to subdue our Passions is the End of all Philosophy he gave the highest Proof of having reduced his to a perfect Calm when he was content with so trifling an Employment as Fiddling with his Cat However I have yet one Doubt which possibly may derogate from his Merit whether he had not passed his grand Climacteric before he found out this charming Amusement I have often been delighted with him even when I was a Child for remarking  That there is a certain general Claim of Kindness and Benevolence which every Species of Creatures has a Right to from us  And think it much to be regretted that this generous Maxim is not more attended to in the Affair of Education for this Reason I admire you for endeavouring to obtain the best Advice you can for the Recovery of your Favourite's Health since the most refined Philosophy allows that we have Reason to believe the  Sensations of small Animals and Insects are in some Cases as exquisite as those of Creatures of far more inlarged Dimensions My darling  Shakespear  seems to be of this Opinion when he says  The poor Beetle that we tread upon in corp'ral Sufferance feels a Pang as great as when a Giant dies  But what amazes me is that you who love Retirement so much have not found out a more rational Companion than your Cat for I am of  Balsac  's Opinion  Que la solitude est certainement une belle chose Mais il y a plaisir d'avoir quelqu'un qui en sçache repondre a qui on puisse dire de tems en tems que la solitude est une belle chose  But I must not forget that as I often wish for your Company you may as often wish to be alone and that I may perhaps be at this Instant breaking in upon one of those Hours which you desire to enjoy without Interruption I shall no longer detain you than while I add that I am and ever shall be  affectionately yours Frances  LETTER LXII  Dear  FANNY  THE Rain overtook me at and there I wished for you as I fear I should have done though you had been present in vain all Night the lifelong Night Between that Stage and this the Rain so moistened my Clay again this Morning that here I am obliged to wish for you both Day and Night but in which Term I desire you most I do assure you I am sometimes doubtful for you alone of all your Sex young and handsome ever brought it any thing near a moot Point whether I should chuse the Possession of your Love or Friendship if by naming one I should be precluded from the other In such a Dilemma I should consider myself like the Paradise of  Erasmus  suspended between Heaven and Hell for tho' Enjoyment either of your Conversation or Person would be Heaven to me the Deprivation of either would be Hell This Equality of Sentiment is not owing to any Luckiness in my Composition setting the Balance between the Rationale and Irrationale of my Constitution but to your extraordinary Merit which makes me think the Enjoyment of your Person would be almost rational and in Return the Sprightliness of your Converse  and Poignancy of your Wit  darts thro' the Soul and almost gives Enjoyment  I left Town with a Cold and my frequent Wettings have so much increased it that I am at present as "hoarse as Bondage" I shall therefore stay here Tonight and quack myself for Tomorrow I will reach  coute qui coute  because I expect to receive a Letter from you there and besides the Impatience I have for Hearing from you I have so much good Breeding with Regard to every Thing which relates to you that it extends itself even to your Letters which I feel myself ashamed for if by any Chance they lie on my Table for a Moment before I kiss the Seal and ravish the Contents  I salute you now in SackWheyOh that it were the Posset  Adieu Adieu  LETTER LXIII On Absence  DEAR to my Soul while thou'rt away  I rather pass than spend the Day  Thy Absence clips the Wings of Time  And every Clock forgets to chime  With thee  L'Allegro  is my Song  Il Penseroso  tunes my Tongue  When thou art goneThe midnight Masque  The wanton Dance and sprightly Flask  The joyous Friends and flowing Bowl  Have lost the Power to warm my Soul  But like  Prometheus  ' Man of Clay  Ere he had felt the solar Ray  I stand unmov'd and wait in dull Suspense  Thy heav'nly Charms to warm me into Sense  LETTER LXIV  I Received my dear  Harry  's Letter and spite of my Resentment at your tedious Silence I find I must forgive I was determined never to write to you again but you have too often proved the Weakness of my Resolution and as  Prior  says  Forc'd to doat on thee thy own Way  I chide thee first and then obey  I thank you for your Poetry I think it extremely pretty but am jealous of the Person it was first addressed to tho' her Right was prior to mine  In the second Line I find you have aptly alluded to  Addison  's Distinction between  spending  our Time and letting it  pass  The second Couplet is truly poetical  Clips the Wings of Time and Clocks forgetting to chime  I  think you have with great Beauty and Judgment observed that Rule mentioned in the  Essay on Criticism  that the Words should seem an Echo to the Sense As for Example  With thee  L'Allegro  is my Song  goes off briskly and the Line is short  Il Penseroso  tunes my Tongue when thou art gone  Here the Words move heavily along and in order to lengthen out the Line you have suspended the Cadence 'till the Middle of the next The same Criticism I think may be made thro' the Whole and the last Line but one is a fine one in this Style I standunmov'dandwaitindullSus"pence"I fancy I see the Statue  I shall be quite piqued if you do not essay something in the poetic Taste in Compliment to me I am such a  Lilliputian  Subject that the Poesy of a Ring would serve me I mean to express my Merits but I should chuse you would rather expatiate on my Faults as the more copious Subject would give you a better Opportunity of shewing your Wit And take notice that if you ever again hint any thing of that Kind in plain Prose I shall call it downright Scolding  I should not finish this Letter so soon but that I find you expect half a Dozen for one so I must husband what little I have to say in the best Manner I can by dividing it into so many Posts  Adeiu  LETTER LXV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I Am not at all surprized at your Story of Mrs 's second Failure for indeed I am not apt to be surprized when I hear of such Things at the first This is not owing to any slight Opinion I have of Women but to the Knowledge I have of human Nature which with my Observation upon the careless and improper Education given to most young Women gives me rather frequent Surprize that we do not more often hear Stories of this Kind  Rochfaucault  who is a severe Moralist as most of the  French  are says  There are many Women who never had an  Affair  but there never was a Woman who had but  one  Which shews that he thought the first Step the only Difficulty Yet I have known some devout Sinners who tho' not able to defend themselves while yet in a State of Innocence vainly imagine to recover Virtue from their Fall like the Fable of  Antaeus  who is said to have gained fresh Strength when  Hercules  threw him on the Ground  Ovid  is severe too on this Subject "Laesa pudicitia est deperit illa semel" Which Passage is too grosly translated to be quoted here  Rowe  has a strong Line in his  Shore  They set like Stars which fall to rise no more  However I do not judge so hardly in this Matter as the Generality of People do I agree with them indeed that when Women fail from Wantoness or Vice it is very probable they may sin on to the End of Life but a Woman may be overcome so many other Ways Excess of Love too great Confidence in the Lover's Honour circumvented by Fraud or overpowered by Surprize that an Adventure of this Kind does not always betoken a Failure in Virtue and a Person injured in any of these Ways may possibly recover Strength from their Misfortunes as a Bone is said to knit firmer in the broken Part than in the sound  The Story you tell me of surprizes me more than the other tho' it is of a Piece with his known Character for of all human Vices Avarice astonishes me most as it appears to me the most unreasonable and unnatural too I should think that Misers may turn Prodigals upon this Principle that they may do so without Cost for he who spends his own Fortune certainly lives at the Expence of his Heir  You are welcome to buy the Books you mention for me for tho' I have read them before I think they will not disgrace my Study and this will give you an Opportunity of reading them yourself  Adieu  Henry  LETTER LXVI  Dear  FANNY  I AM extremely angry at Mrs for misrepresenting the Story you allude to I said indeed the Words to her and quoted them from a sprightly Lady of my Acquaintance but mentioned no Name and as there was certainly Wit in them she might probably attribute them to you and meant to compliment you with supposing you the Author It was Mrs who made Use of those Expressions on the Occasion I told her I declare that in any Part either of our Conversation or Correspondence I never remember you to have used any Expression  less modest than the Speech of  Prudes    or to have hinted or even seemed to relish the least double Entendre and I assure you I have often wondered that a Person who has as much Wit Spirit and Wildness in her Imagination as any one I know should have in Reality more Delicacy in her Sentiments and more Decency in her Expressions than I ever met with in any other Woman  It is upon this Account that I give you the Credit of more Wit than other Women as that Beauty must have greater Charms who  pleases a Man when she is cloathed than are necessary to move him when she is naked  But indeed I think in general that when Lewdness or Prophaneness are called in as Helps to Wit they but betray the Weakness of it as narrow Waters mark their Limits by exposing the Shallows  Cowley  speaks very prettily upon this Subject but I need not quote because you have him by Heart  Adeiu  LETTER LXVII  My dear  FANNY  I AM thank God quite well Today but must be cautious I shall stay at Home most Part of the Day and only take a Chair for an Hour to drink Tea with you and return the Manuscripts It was an Entertainment to read over most of the Letters I have wrote to you since the Commencement of our Acquaintance during the Course of a Correspondence remarkable for its Regularity and Constancy I read them in a confused Manner because there are but few of them dated and I was sorry I had not yours in Town to bring them  Face to Face which would have been a great Amusement to me during this Confinement as my Head was not well enough to venture upon more abstruse Studies I find you have destroyed a great many of my Letters for I remember a Folio of Advice which I suppose you mistook for Scolding and threw into the Fire I had a Mind to serve the rest after the same Manner and only spared them because you had done so  I send you  West  on the Employment of Time which is worth Reading not for saying any Thing new but for collecting together upon so important a Subject the Sense not  Opinions  of Mankind the thinking Part Read the Preface last which I think might be better stiled an Appendix  Farewel  LETTER LXVIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES  Wrote on the Death of  J K  Esq  HE was a Man of most excellent CompositionHis Characteristicks were many and extraordinary He was generous without Extravagance Oeconomist without Parsimony  had Pride without Vanity and was friendly without Professing A Libertine without Vice Religious without Bigotry and an Enthusiast without Fanaticism  He was a Man take him for all in all you shall not find his Fellow  or to have examined him by Parts you would have found each Character perfect like the Division of Matter where every Atom contains in itself the Dimensions of Solidity  He is dead but thou art alive The Lord's Will was done in the first Instance and mine in the Second Accept now an undivided Heart and live long to help me to forget my Grief  Henry  LETTER LXIX  THE Pleasure that I received from my dear  Harry  's Letter could alone compensate for the Pain I felt from your unusual Silence but you have made me large Amends and I can readily forget all that is past provided you do not repeat your Fault I am so thoroughly persuaded of your Tenderness for me that I know I need but tell how much your Silence affects me never to feel the Effects of it more  In short my Heart's dear  Harry  I am quite charmed with that manly Fondness that Elegance  of Love which you express in your last dear Letter and for the future I shall say with  Emma    Doubt shall for ever quit my strengthen'd Heart  And anxious Jealousy's corroding Smart  Nor other Inmate shall inhabit there  But soft Belief young Joy and pleasing Care  In spite of Medicines I grow worse every Day and am really reduced to a most melancholy State but you my dearest  Harry  have brought back calm Content to visit me and all may yet be well I have not known a Flight of Spirits since you left Town 'till I received your last and then I could not help bursting into  Othello  's Exclamation  If I were now to die I were now to be most happy  c  I cannot help thinking that Fate seems averse to my Recovery for the Sun  as if the Sun could envy  denies his wonted Beams nor with more Regret beholds me drooping than the Bells of Lillies I have for this Month past had a severe Cough and constant Pain across my Chest I am worn to a Skeleton and yet look as well as I ever did but far more delicate My Disorder is extremely polite for tho' it deprives me of the Reality it leaves me the Appearance of Health and I am so much a Woman to forgive the Substance for the Shadow  I think you have done the strictest Justice to our fair Friend's Character she is indeed a charming Girl Pray tell me when you think of coming to Town I fear you are grown so passionately fond of  Belvidere  that you have no Wish for any Thing beside nor even send a Sigh in Pity to your banished Friends However let the Time of our Exile be limited and when we have a Goal in View the Race will seem less tedious  My Hand trembles so violently that I can scarce hold my Pen I dare say you will find it difficult to decypher my  Hebrew  Characters I will therefore leave Puzzling and in the plainest which are generally the sincerest Terms assure you that  I am and ever shall be Your faithfully affectionate Frances  LETTER LXX  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED two Letters from you since my last and am heartily sorry to find you still continue ill You give me great Comfort  however by saying you have Hopes from Regularity and the Waters Because I am very certain they jointly will cure you I have often told you so and it is some Satisfaction to find you at length profiting like  Hudibras  of  Ralpho  's Gifts If I could perfectly master the Tenderness I have for you and only attend to the Friendship I bear you I should rejoice to hear you are so far ill as to require severe and speedy Assistance as I was at the taking of  Bergen  and other Towns belonging to the  Dutch  because I was then in Hopes as I am now for you that they would exert their utmost Vigour and Resolution when Destruction was coming so home to them tho' they were shamefully careless and lukewarm about their Safety before  I am sorry to find you still continue to give an unfair Turn to every Thing I say and do In your first Letter you twist and warp my Meaning in the Allusion of  Prior  and play  ShuttleCock  with my plain Sense meerly to amuse your own Jeu d'Esprit In your second Letter you misunderstand me greatly nay seem to forget intirely the gossipping Affair But you are sick and I am sorry  Adeiu  LETTER LXXI  My dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED yours this Morning and do assure you without Compliment that it wanted nothing but your being in the Right to be the best wrote Letter I ever read I commend every Thing but the Injustice of it like a certain Exile from  Athens  who could not forbear applauding and repeating to Strangers an Oration of  Demosthenes  by which the Wretch was banished The Cause of many of our Quarrels has been owing as at present to your never considering any Thing but the Matter before you When you receive my Letters you find some Things to displease you but never recollect your own which gave the Provocation You wrote me lately two of the most mortifying Letters which could be well imagined and now seem surprized I should resent them Consider that the Height of our Picques is always in Proportion to our Love and if had charged me with all the cruel Things you did I should not have offended her by any Reply inconsistent with the natural Complaisance I have for even the most disagreeable of your Sex You say several Things which when I require an Explanation of you cut me  short by answering me you was only in Jest These Things are certainly inconsistent at least and surely if you had reflected the least on them when you say  you so strictly examined your whole Conduct  I am persuaded you would have been generous and ingenuous enough to acknowledge I had good Reason to be provoked at being puzzled by contradictory Appearances and jested with in Matters which both mortified and alarmed me I confess indeed that I have many Faults but do not my Dear so vainly acquit yourself of any  I realy think you have many valuable Qualities and a great Number of agreeable ones and I have been always endeavouring to screen them from some irregular Flights and romantick Whims which are by no Means any Ornament to your Understanding I was but acting the good Farmer's Part and winnowing the Chaff from among the Wheat for could I but rid you of a few light Errors I think you need not the Addition of one Merit to make you perfect I have therefore on many Occasions restrained and disguised my Love and Tenderness for you like a cautious Parent lest it should but increase those irregular Whims and romantick Dreams which I have often wished out of your charming Composition My Actions I think kept on still one constant Tenor and always shall because my Principles  are in my own Power my Expressions and Manners indeed often varied as your Behaviour affected them because my Passions are in your Power you can increase or abate my Fondness but it is not in the Power of the rest of the World or what is more even of yourself to alter the obstinate and determined Purpose of my Actions towards you for where as I have Reason to apprehend from the strong Hints you gave me in your last Letter the Poverty of my Nature and Ungenerousness of my Principles shall leave me weak for so good a Work I will even borrow the Semblance of those Virtues which may best assist me to acquit myself as a Man of Honour to you  So shall Dissemblage once be virtuous in me  I confess that the Manner of my Invitation to had not all the Decorum it should have had at another Time but consider the Mortifications and Picque I laboured under just then from your Letters and Behaviour and it will convince you of the Truth of what I have just said that your Actions cannot lessen my Kindness tho' they may destroy my Complaisance  Farewel  Henry  LETTER LXXII  Dear  FANNY  LAST Post I received a Letter from the Answer of which he desires may be inclosed to you because he says you know where to direct to him From which Hint I gather two Things both equally disagreeable to me that you correspond with him and that he still knows you write to me and you know it was without my Consent or Approbation that he was at first let into the Secret That either of these Things gives me Offence my dear  Fanny  proceeds plainly from an high Sense of Honour and a generous Regard for you If I could basely indulge a Vanity of this Kind I do not know any Thing could answer the End so well as the letting your Correspondence with me be publicly known That it was not as I find now a particular Favour to me might indeed humble the Vanity of it but would not lessen the Pleasure for I take this Opportunity to assure you that tho' your Letters should come even thro' the Press to my Hands I do not know any Thing could give me a more agreeable Entertainment and I should then only chide you as  Alexander  did  Aristotle  for publishing his Works because what was before his  particular Study and the highest of his retired Pleasures more estimable than all his Conquests was then become common to all the World  It is the Nature of Man to render himself often miserable merely for the Vanity of being thought happy but I declare I would rather rejoice at being thought unhappy than even suspected to be otherwise at your least Expence If my Love my Friendship did not incline me to this Honour nay common Manhood would require it from me in the nice Circumstances of our Loves at present My Character is Libertine your Fortunes are small your Experience of the World but little your Age young and your Guardian old In such a Situation you should take Care not to trust to the charitable Opinion of the World who will hardly be brought to believe that either our Conversation or our Correspondence are upon such innocent Subjects as in Truth they are and if any Surmises should arise to the contrary as I fear this Indiscretion with Regard to whose Notions are not much out of the common Road of Things may give Occasion for it would not be in my Power to justify you nor indeed can any Thing a Man may say or swear upon such Occasions either condemn or acquit a Woman in my Opinion for if he traduces her Character I should think he might do so as well out of Falshood as Baseness and if he vindicates it I  might apprehend that he should do so as well out of Honour as Truth When I say I am displeased with your writing to I am not jealous of your Love but your Character which I have very honest Reasons to be careful of If you understand me right in any Reproof I ever gave you it would but improve your Love and Esteem for me which will be a fair Return for that warm Passion and sincere Friendship I at present feel toward my Heart's dearest  Fanny    Adeiu  LETTER LXXIII  Dear  FANNY  THE Alliances you mention from the public Prints either by Marriage or political Treaty cannot give us that Security for a general Peace which you so piously wish for No Tyes but its own State Policy govern even the best and no Principle but Ambition sways the worst of Princes It is certain that political Morals and private may easily be evinced the same and the Obligations between State and State the same as between Man and Man Nay much stronger the Reason may seem upon  the former yet it is astonishing that an Opinion so obvious should still be new for there are few Authors who confine political Maxims or what they term Reasons of State to the same Strictness they do private Morals I hope it is more owing to a wrong Judgment upon this Subject than to the Depravity of human Nature that so much Injustice and cruel Havock is made in the World by the lawless Ambition of Princes that Liberty Property or Life are safe no longer than our stronger Neighbour is pleased to be at rest and that the Sons of the Earth like the Army of  Cadmus  rise up only to destroy each other  The last Article of the  French  Paragraphs is really so ridiculous that I cannot determine whether the Publisher is in jest or earnest  Adeiu  LETTER LXXIV  My dear  FANNY  MRS 's Behaviour will certainly confirm the World's Opinion of her for some Time past True Virtue is modest in its Defence but Frailty like Cowardice puts on the Air of a Bully to disguise its Weakness  There is nothing which Women resent so highly as the free Manner with which the World judge and speak of their Actions I own that I have often myself joined with them in condemning such hasty Censures but upon more general Reflection I can't help agreeing with the World that few Women ever lose their Reputation 'till they have at least deserved to do so for tho' some may escape the actual Guilt who have suffered the Imputation of it yet their Indiscretions must have justly drawn upon them the Censure of the World and having gone so far they have done their Part and to speak like a Man of Gallantry it is the Lover's Fault if they go no farther  As I have really a great Tenderness for the  fair Sex  it often provokes me to hear some People either ignorantly or maliciously pretend to justify their Characters at the same Time they acknowledge all Appearances to be strong against them for this is even to allow they had the Vice and Folly of a Harlot but wanted her only Virtue Courage How cruel and severe must it be to say a Woman had no one Quality or Principle to preserve her from Perdition but Cowardice and how unhappy must it be for her too when she finds this  Hypocrisy against the Devil  will not avail her either in this World or the next for as the "Supervision" is seldom indulged to the Speculation of the  Curious People can only judge as  Iago  expresses it  by Circumstances leading to the Door of Truth  and as for the next World I fear Heaven needs no overt Act to prove loose Morals Treason  You see my Dear what a different Side of this Question you have reclaimed me to you have not only won my Heart but my Morals too not that the cowardly Despair of Conquest would ever have brought my indomitable Spirit to yield 'till by weighing well your Worth against your Person I thought I should gain like  Porus  by my Defeat  LETTER LXXV  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED your Letter from  Liverpool  which like most of your Letters of late was very pretty and very provoking If you had as much Ingenuousness as Ingenuity we should have been always upon better Terms than we are However you are honest enough to confess yourself a Woman which at the same Time accounts naturally for your Inconsistency and gives me comfortable Hopes that we nay again be very good Friends for I have great Sympathy in me with meer mortal  Women but have the most clumsy Address you can imagine towards your infallible Divinities  I do not know any Person who can tell a Story better and to whom it is more Advantage to be put upon the Defensive your Letter is a remarkable Instance of this for it is equally filled with literal as well as metaphorical  Turns  However I shall not dwell any longer on this Head since you are become a Woman but conclude this Letter with referring you to the Ode of the Book of  Horace  which you may meet with translated by several Hands to which desiring your Answer sincerely I subscribe myself  Your constant Friend Lover and humble Servant  LETTER LXXVI  Dear  FANNY  I AM just returned from my Circuit and found your Letter here which I was doubly pleased at to hear you were well and to hear you were coming to Town I laughed a good deal at myself just after I had wrote my last Letter to you to think of my Carelesness about  the Number of the Book and Ode of  Horace  I alluded to I did not exactly remember Chapter and Verse when I was writing but left Blanks to be filled up when I returned from my Study but forgot it 'till the Day after my Letter went However I am extremely satisfied at my Mistake now as you so quickly found out the Allusion Le Sage entend a demi môt and that I hope from thence it was from a strong Sympathy between us on the same Subject  Donec gratus eram tibe  c  I am sorry tho' to hear you call this but an Armstice for I assure you I sincerely meant a lasting Peace but I suppose you know your own Temper to be so like the  French  warm lively and restless that you look on all Terms made with you as with them to be only Truces gaining Breath to renew the Fight You say modestly you have no Hopes of  regaining  my Friendship and you are in the Right of it in Strictness of Speech for you have indeed never lost it nor are you likely so to do for as I have sometimes said or meant to say to you I find you have my Friendship in spite of yourself and my Love in spite of myself And on these Terms we shall always be from a happy Discovery I have made lately that you have been and shall always be in the Right in every Article of your Life Not that this Truth  appears to me with all the Strength of Demonstration I could wish but I read you as I do  Euclid  impatient to come to some pleasant practical Problem I take all the Theorems for granted which lead to so charming an End  I delivered your Letter and Pantin to my Sister she leaves me soon and will answer you I believe in Person  Adieu  Here followed an Interval of six Months in which Time there passed no Sort of Intercourse either of Visit or Correspondence for  Frances  had taken Offence at some Particulars in  Henry  's Behaviour but they happened to meet at a third Place just before the following Letter was written and  Frances  made a Request that he would return all her Letters being resolved to take Leave of the Correspondence for Life But the following Epistles soon reconciled them to each other again  LETTER LXXVII Elton  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I HAVE brought your Letters thus far that I might flatter myself with the Possession of them Half a Day longer and that they may be the less Time between your Hands and mine as I can intercept the Stage this Day at Dinner  I was several Times tempted to break my Word with you for the first Time I declare lest the Recollection which these dear Memorandums may give you of your having once loved me so well may provoke you now to hate me even more than you do I return them then to you as the only Equivalent I could ever make you for their Value and from a Principle I have some where before mentioned that I shall never desire any Tye over the Person I love but their own Inclinations and this is the Reason perhaps that I never married yet tho' never tempted to it but once in my Life and for their Sake more than my own rejoice now that it never happened  In Return for your Letters you offered me mine but I desired you to burn them which  I now revoke leaving them intirely at your Disposal for the only Reason I had for destroying them was that they might never be ashamed in Company with  yours  but as I beg you will keep  them  safe mine may serve to explain or illustrate some Passages for Foils they want not  I often refused you your Letters and should ever have continued obstinate in that Point while I had any Hopes of pleasing you otherways but in that Despair part madly with the only Things which can please myself now  In order to make this Sacrifice the stronger I read over all your Letters before I parted with them tho' this was a fond Folly as I am very sure I had every one of them by Heart before And now my ever best loved Girl accept these returned dear Pledges as a Sacrifice fit for the  Gods  religiously so as I flatter myself from former Recollection the Heart joined in the Address Let  them  boast of Inspiration if heavenly Spirits can taste of Vanity of this Loan you have acquitted yourself back with Interest for the Rays of Inspiration like Sunbeams give Light in the direct Line but owe their Heat to Reflection  I kept all your Letters as they were wrote by you and restore them now because I believe you repent your ever having wrote them  Lifeless Charms without the Heart  I shall always remember with Love and Gratitude any Kindness you ever shewed me I unfeignedly forgive the severe Treatment I have lately met with from you and shall hereafter rest satisfied in whatever Light you are pleased to regard me  As a Lover Friend Companion or most humble and obedient Servant  LETTER LXXVIII  SIR  THO' your Politeness forbid your desiring an Acknowledgment of the most trifling Favour with Regard to yourself and the most material one with Regard to me that you have perhaps ever conferred yet as I never meant tho' I may have failed in the Execution of my Design to be outdone in Generosity I now think it incumbent on me to offer my Thanks not according to the Value of the Present but to the Design of the Giver Were I not afraid of appearing insolent or ungrateful I need not have had Resource to this Method of shewing my Gratitude since I could with more  Ease to myself and I am sure Pleasure to you have returned the Obligation an hundred Fold  By returning his Letters  but the Author whom I have oftenest quoted to you and is of Course my greatest Favourite says  It is the highest Act of Ingratitude to  overpay  an Obligation which we receive from an  Equal  or  Superior    In which of these Denominations you are pleased to stile yourself I shall on this Occasion subscribe myself  Your most obliged and most obedient Servant Frances  LETTER LXXIX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I SHOULD have answered your Letter sooner but waited 'till I came here both because I have some Pleasure in writing to you from the Scene whence most of my Letters were dated to you and that I hope the Inclosed  His Picture  will be some Apology for the Freedom of writing to you now not from the Value of the Present but from the Obedience I shall always be proud  to shew to any Request of yours After the Sacrifice I have lately made you could have no Reason to doubt of my Compliance in this Particular or that I should refuse you the  Shadow  of that Substance which while it shall be enlivened with a Spirit of Sense Reflection or Gratitude must be ever your's Constant Lovers need only the Exchange of Hearts but fickle ones have need of Tokens Accept then of this as it is the only Way I fear is left me of restoring my Image to you And having already Fortune de l'Amour lost what I loved as well and liked infinitely better than myself I shall find no Difficulty in parting thus from that same self since you are pleased to act a Part in  Aesop  's Fables to quit the Substance and embrace the Shadow  You see I am resolved the Correspondence shall not drop on my Side and indeed I shall with real Transport take Advantage of every Occasion which will not appear Presumption on my former Happiness of assuring you that  I am with Sincerity Truth and Constancy Your's Henry  LETTER LXXX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED your Letter and shall continue the Corespondence while you will give me Leave Indeed I find something which pleases and flatters me too much in any Engagement with you to be easily discouraged for I sincerely think that vain as you are you do not know your own Merit or Value Your Writing particularly I really do not know any Thing in  English  equal to for Delicacy of Sentiment or Turn of Expression There are some faint Traces of your Point and Stile in a few of the polite  French  Authors almost to persuade one they were Imitations if there were not such strong Lines in yours of an Original  You say "here ends my Palinode" but pray Where did it begin What Recantation have you made of your Mistake or unkind and unjust Abuse of me What Answer have you given yet to a late Letter of mine where giving you the full Force of your Argument against me I will hazard my Defence in this World or the next upon my Justification there made where I was no more culpable than if I had lent you a Horse which by starting accidentally had broke your Leg But tho' it  gave you no just  Cause  for your unkind Treatment of me I own it afforded you a plausible Occasion being already determined Now as your Author  Rochfaucault  says a Woman never quits her first Love 'till she has engaged in a Second I shall be therefore much obliged if you will trust my Confidence so far as to let me know who my Rival is Nor have you any Thing to fear for him in this from a Wretch as impotent in Means as I have ever been in Will to be malicious And indeed it would be Madness in me to make my Rivals in your Love my Enemies for I am vain enough to think myself able to stand against a Multitude  You have often unjustly charged me with seeking an Opportunity of breaking with you on whom I pray does that Charge ungenerous as it is fall with the greatest Justice at present You have yourself presented that fair Occasion and yet see the Obstinacy of my Attachments to you and indeed the only Malice of the rest of my Life towards you shall be to convince you and you only how unkind and unjust so base a Sentiment was of me  I am my dearest  Fanny  your very sincere and constant Lover and Friend    P S  I found the Inclosed  The Case of his Picture  after I wrote to you last and send it kindly to you as it will help to hide even my Shadow from you  LETTER LXXXI  SIR  I CANNOT recollect any Period of my Life wherein I found myself more embarrassed than at this Moment As there is nothing I wish more earnestly to avoid than a Repetition of what now appears the most  assured Weakness  I ever did or can commitaddressing you by Letter  At the same Time the Complaisance you have shewn to my Requests obliges me to think tho' my  Thanks  can hardly be deemed an Acknowledgment for your late Favours it must appear like Ingratitude not to offer  them    Accept then of the poor but only return that is in my Power to make and let me add my sincere Wishes that I may be able to preserve the  Picture  you have sent much longer than you suffered me to do  that  which I unskilful had drawn of you  You say  I have quitted the Substance for the Shadow  I think you are deceived for I am sure there is more Stability and Truth in this miniature Mimickry than in most Originals I have ever known And yet I should even fear a Disappointment in this had I not long since proved the Fallacy of sympathetick  Influence  Ixion  's Fate thro' the greatest Part of my Life has still been mine but from your last Present and many other Circumstances of my instant Fortunes I have Reason to think the Scene is at length inverted and that Shadows alone elude my Grasp If I am in an Error I beg you will not undeceive me for I have taken great Pains to arrive at that Pitch of Philosophy common to all prudent Mortals of thinking that whatever is out of my Reach is not worth having  Farewel  LETTER LXXXII  BECAUSE I cannot bear to have you remain in a Mistake even in so trifling a Matter as any Thing must be which relates to me I shall trouble you with a few Remarks upon a late Conversation  You surprized me extremely by saying that  a Heart when  broken  can with more Ease be divided  and  a  broken  LookingGlass reflects more Images than a whole one  are the same Thoughts Now I really think a  broken  Pitcher is as like either of them as they are the one to the other for having had the  Misfortune to be  broken  it agrees in the only Circumstance common to them both  Observe that mine is a Thought  Suckling  's only a Simile If there was any Wit in mine it is owing to itself alone if there was any in his it must be owing to the Allusion for there was certainly none in saying the Parts of a Thing are more in Number than the Whole  There was nothing alike even in the Occasions of his Sentiment and mine He vile Libertine meant I suppose to apologize for his general Inconstancy I like a simple Swain to assert a double Constancy Now the Scope of  Suckling  's Poem I know not having never read any of his Works but what I have met quoted and in general few Persons have read less of polite Authors than myself therefore I can only reason upon this Passage as I received it from you Let us see then since the Wit of it is denied whether we can allow him even common Sense in this Illustration of his He tells his Mistress I suppose in Excuse for his Inconstancy that her Cruelty or his Excess of Love has torn his tempestbeating Heart into so many Pieces that like a broken LookingGlass it reflects more Objects than when whole Now I have seen Fragments of Mirrours sometimes which have indeed reflected my Image as whatever shews me truly must in your Opinion be a  Reflection  but then they  only multiplied the Object not exhibited any new Therefore if the Simile had been just his broken Heart should rather have increased his Constancy by affording him more Fragments susceptible of her Idea as one may be said to multiply Life by dissecting a Worm because each Part lives tho' like a broken Heart it lives in Pain If indeed she had expressed Surprize that a wounded Heart should still preserve its Constancy towards the Author of its Destruction his Simile tho' even here it would not come up to Wit might make a pretty Glare among the  Faux brilliant    He might say perhaps that the Fragments of a LookingGlass may comprehend more Objects than one but sure a whole one is capable of receiving more therefore a Man free from Love may and is more susceptible of many Impressions than one who has had the Misfortune of a broken Heart  Now the Reason I apprehend of your charging me with Plagiary is this  Suckling  you have admired and not finding either Sense or Wit in this Passage you had Reason to conclude they were both stolen and as I am a Person who in Wit as well as Fortune appears to live above my Means you had Reason to suspect me for the Theft    To be continued as the Author meets with Encouragement    LETTER LXXXIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    YOU see my Impatience of writing to you which does not wait for the Post and has got the better of a hot wet Day bad Paper Pens and Ink and a strong Inclination to sleep to pay me for last Night's Excess  I hope you all got safe to Town and found yourselves all safe in Town I beg to know with what Grace ye were differently accosted by wise Men and Parents for it is a vast Amusement to me to hear how innocent Frolicks are treated by sensible welldisposed Christians who know any Thing better than human Nature or the World  I recant my Error my dearest  Fanny  and here throw my Palinode at your Feet That I was loved let my Vanity now confess which my Humility made me doubt before It was a Madness to doubt at first according to a certain Definition of it a Reasoning right upon wrong Principles I thought it gross to Sense that I should be capable of inspiring that soft tender Passion I thought it possible indeed I might gain a Friend but never hoped to be able to win a Mistress so used to flatter myself as  Addison  does  Pope  upon his Eclogues that  if they are not Pastorals they are something better Another Reason I had to suspect I was not loved was that I feared I was no longer so and true Love like true Hanging or Drowning according to my Notion is not to be remedied on this Side the Grave I have observed to you before that true Love like the SmallPox never attacks us but once and Reason good because it lasts for Life It is a Kind of free ParadiseStock which can admit of no Inoculation so luxuriant that it is impatient of Pruning nor suffers itself to be twined into Espaliers A Scion of it was stolen by  Adam  when he was banished the Garden of  Eden  who to repair his Crime as much as in him lay bequeathed this divine Plant to such of his Posterity who should prefer Nakedness to Knowledge and piously attend to the Voice of Nature in open Defiance of every Preacher from the Serpent down to Consider of what has been said  c  Henry  LETTER LXXXIV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I AM much obliged for the Impatience you express of writing to me and sincerely  wish I could return the Compliment with Sincerity But at last that quick Spirit you have so often complained of is quite extinct There are so few Things in Life that can give me Pleasure that I cannot help regretting the Change in my Sentiments with Regard to Writing as by losing my Relish for it I have lost one of my principal Amusements  If a little Recollection recalled the Evidences of Truth to your Mind I am pleased the Conversation arose which at the Time it happened so much displeased me I know not how to suppose without having the meanest Opinion of you that you could ever entertain a Doubt If I thought it were possible you could I should only say may your Crime be your Punishment for "he who suspects deserves to find it true" As all Matters of this Kind are now and ever shall be as tho' they had never been you may be well assured I shall never give you or myself the Trouble of endeavouring to convince you of the Reality of a Passion which no longer exists but as there is no Imputation I could not more easily pardon than that you have charged me with as Hypocrisy is of all Vices most foreign to my open Heart give me Leave to ask you What End could be proposed from feigning What were the Advantages which could or did arise from the Reality What  other Cause in Nature can be assigned for a Person not quite an Ideot naturally prone to strong Resentments enduring the most provoking Insolence and I hope unparalelled Illnature without even shewing she was sensible of being sacrificed to every Gust of Vanity or Illhumour in your Temper or that of any other Person who thought proper to make their Court to you by slighting her Too plainly she for Years evinced the Truth of  Rochfaucault  's Opinion  We forgive as long as we love  Deal plainly with me Answer to these Truths if you can refute them or derive them from any other Cause I will confess that  Fanny  indeed  has much imposed upon herself  and allow what you have sometimes said that the natural Coquetry of her Disposition with a little Flight of Romance by being indulged too far had wrought upon her Mind the Semblance of a Passion which existed not in the Heart  How cruel is Reflection after Passion How different are the Points of Sight on the same Objects Why is not Reason strong enough to keep her Throne or so intirely vanished as never to reassume it  I am weary of this continued Warfare  As your Sentiments of Love and mine were always different I am pleased to find we at last agree in one Point that  like the  SmallPox it never attacks us twice  like that too where it is violent the Marks last for Life but the best and truest Affinity between them is that like that it may be cured I own it requires violent Corrosives but I am a living Instance that tho' the Cure is painful it is possible According to your idle Definition of Love it is plain I never was possessed of your's there is not any Thing nouvelle in this Discovery that Point has long been clear to me nor has it been in my Power for a vast While past tho' I took great Pains  to impose upon myself  with Regard to your Sentiments for me For this Reason I have ever been an earnest Advocate for your Friendship and still continue to desire it which I think the highest Compliment I can pay you as it is the strongest Proof of mine  Capt is to be married this Night to Miss I hear they set out for Tomorrow if so I suppose you'll be so much engaged that I shall not see you If it is inconvenient I beg you will not stir one Step towards me nor idly fancy I shall take your Absence ill as you may be perfectly assured that no Action or Omission of your future Life can either add to or take from the calm settled Regard I have now and ever shall retain for your Happiness and Welfare I am while  you continue to desire I should be so and much longer than you deserve  Your real Friend and most obedient Servant Frances  LETTER LXXXV  Dear  FANNY  YOU may see by the Badness of my Paper that I have not waited to get home before I indulged myself in the Privilege you have given me of writing to you I am now at where Parson lately lived and where your Friend's Brother is now beneficed This Paper is good enough to write Sermons on that when they are applied to their most general Use there may be but little Cost and perhaps it is the fitter for me too lest should I send you better the Messenger might be more worth than the Message tho' by it I with all Sincerity commend my Love to you corrected and amended from the Errors of the former Edition the  Impression  still remaining the same which tho' the  Type  is small I still retain for the Fairness and Beauty of the  Character    The Gentleman I am now with is a Person I contracted a Friendship with several Years ago upon a certain Sympathy I observed between us in three remarkable Particulars An Aversion to Matrimony a splenetick Cast of Mind and an unsociable Impatience at Fools But tho' the Effects are equally visible in us both they are owing to very different Causes in each of us The First proceeds in him from an  habitual  Disregard to Women for I can never allow that to be natural to any Man In me it proceeds from an Apprehension of not meeting Success with a Woman of Merit and Fortune and to take off the Merit of such Humility I make myself Amends by the Pride of not hazarding a Refusal The Second he has from a strong saturnine Complexion which was born with him but I have contracted that "gloomy Habit of Soul" from the many Mortifications and Disappointments I have met with almost ever since I was born The Third proceeds in him as a Man of Sense from a strong Antipathy he has naturally to such Animals joined to a generous Concern and honest Pride that Providence who could make such a M  n as him should suffer such imperfect Essays of human Nature to slip unfinished thro' his Hands but I am shocked at Fools perhaps as a Person deformed by Nature or rendered  o  by Disease may be at the Sight of his own Picture on Canvass or in the Glass  You see how occasionally I am led into a Description of my own Character which as it was Part of your Injunction to me you may perceive how strong an Impression your Commands make on my Mind that I am naturally led to obey them even when I don't particularly intend it but when I finish the Remainder of your Request I must sit down on deliberate Purpose for it as I despair of meeting any where save in my own Heart a Semblance good enough to draw your Likeness from  I now claim your Promise my dear  Fanny  of speaking with Freedom some Things which you hesitated once or twice about the few and very short Times I was in your Company the last Time I was in Town I shall be at home by the Return of the Post  I am  my dear agreeable Girl  sincerely and affectionately Your's  LETTER LXXXVI  Dear  FANNY  I AM glad to hear you are out of Danger and wish you were as much out of Apprehension  too You wrong me I never was so illbred as to charge you with Strength of Body or Robustness of Constitution but I had always a Whim in my Head that the most delicate Frames might live in Health which being independent of strong Features or large Limbs there might be Health as well as Life in a Mussel My Words and Actions never did contradict each other with Regard to you when they appeared to do so it was because you mistook either one or the other and I suspect your Error to be about the last and for this Reason too that my Words proceed from my Heart which by that Heart I swear is sincerely and affectionately attached to you but my Actions are crossed or restrained by your's which are governed by Caprice and a Temper bizarre Your Manner with me is extremely whimsical on your Part and dispiriting on mine and if you knew my natural Disposition and the vast and continued Calls I have for every Thought and Application I am Master of you'd be convinced of the Truth of my Attachment to you when I strive still to hold you even upon these Terms I beg to hear from you soon and that you will be neither sick or cross What an extravagant Passion for Change must that Woman have who can be the most agreeable Person in the World and yet for the Sake of Variety chuses to be otherwise  As Mrs  Diana  says  You fine Ladies affect an Undress  Pray tell me how I put it out of your Power to accept my Invitation which I again repeat and never gave one in my Life more sincerely  I am  my dear little cross Pett  your constant goodhumoured clumsy Country Farmer  LETTER LXXXVII  Dear  HARRY  I AM very ill able to write at all from the Effects of my Fatigue and less able to write to you than any one My Spirits are so much dissipated that it is impossible to call them home I would say much yet can't say any Thing A continued Variation of Objects has deprived me of the Power of forming Ideas and all the Account I can give of myself at present is that the Regret I felt at parting with you obtrudes itself on the Pleasure I receive from meeting the few that I love or the still fewer that love me To sum up all I am a perfect Antithesis  We met with no Accident but a Companion tolerably agreeably in the Coach so with  a Kind of  as it were  we jogged on quietly to  London  For my own Part I should have been better pleased to have had the Coach to myself as I might then have given Vent to the Croud of Ideas which filled my Mind and by being confined there have rendered it the Seat of Anarchy and Confusion  My Aunt is in the Country at Lord 's So far all is well I lay last Night and am now in  BondStreet  all here are much yours' You must not expect any Kind of Entertainment from my Letters you beat me all to nothing in Compliments but I think I make it up in Realities You were polite enough to say that I had restored the rational Enjoyment of your little  Eden  to you I can with Truth affirm that you have deprived me of the rational Enjoyment of my little Kingdom I mean my Mindat least you have destroyed perhaps the only Mark of Rationality I had about me Risibility I have hardly smiled since we parted In short my Intellects are much too weak to bear the Feelings of my Heart  Or ne'er to meet or ne'er to part is Peace  But I will have done with this Subject lest I should launch again into those Follies which while I am guilty of I despise  Adieu my once again dear  Harry  remember you are now in the Situation of  Porus    if you think your present Empire worth preserving beware of Tyranny for there cannot be a second Restoration  I am and ever wish to continue sincerely and affectionately Your's  LETTER LXXXVIII  Musaeum Chere  MIGNONNE  I AM heartily fatigued with our Assizes where we had a great deal of Hanging Wrangling and Duelling with other Amusements of that Kind which however was some Relief to me after our Parting as the Company of Fools or Knaves must for the Time quite exclude any Thought of you from my Mind and give me less Leisure to lament your Absence But I am now returned to myself and by giving up myself intirely to you may say with  Glocester    Richard  's himself again  When I walk about my Improvements where you so short a Time and so long ago was with me I recollect at each different Scene every Thing you said to me then and there  In the Midst of these Reflections I often repeat these Lines in my favourite Ode of  Boileau    Voici les Lieux charmants oú mon âme ravi  Passoit à contempler  Silvié    Ces tranquilles Moments si doûcement perdues  What I told you was indeed true that your Presence here had restored me to the rational Enjoyment of my rural Retreat I may now say that your Correspondence has given me for I would express it strongly the rational Enjoyment of your Absence While you were with me your sprightly Sense as it were awakened me from my supine lethargick Life and I felt my Intellects growing strong like one recovering from a Delirium and your Absence may be considered but as a certain Distance at which all beautiful Objects are placed that their Proportions may be more distinctly observed and their Symmetry viewed with less Confusion  My sincere Compliments to  Kitty  and thank her for the Postscript on the Back of your Letter and to speak in my Stile as a Man of Business if any Thing could be an Addition to the Credit of your Bill it must be her Indorsement on it  Adieu  Henry  LETTER LXXXIX  I HEARTILY thank you dear  Harry  for your kind and obliging Letter I rejoice at the Conclusion of the tiresome Scene I left you engaged in and that you are once more returned to you dear little  Eden  It is but fair that you should make a Kind of local  Memory  for me as  mine  is so much devoted to those Moments we spent together that they alone are present to me and these which I now pass seem but the faint Recollection of insipid Ideas My Imagination lively as your own accompanies you thro' every Step we ever trod together I walk with you sit with you talk to you but oh there ends the charming Reverie I cannot dare not venture to make Replies for you accustomed as I have been to that elegant Sense that flows for ever from your Lips my Understanding will not bear to be "imposed upon even by myself"  My Aunt is still in the Country I have been in the most uncomfortable Way that ever was since I came to Town I have been much out of Order with a constant Pain in my Side and living as it were on the Publick without a Home I have at last got Lodgings at but for particular Reasons would have you direct to  BondStreet    It would be impossible to give you an Idea of Mrs 's Behaviour to me She has however done me a real Service by it for tho' it is not even in her Power to prevent my having the sincerest Regard for her Welfare she has in a few Days weaned me from that painful Tenderness which was contracted by Years of Intimacy and by which I must have suffered severely at our Parting She set out this Morning for  Wales  may she there and every where meet that Happiness she so much deserves however hardly she may deal with me Don't reply to this Paragraph lest I should be tempted to accuse you as the Cause of having lost this still dear and ever valuable Friend  I was a good deal surprized to find by your Letter to  Kitty  that you did not intend Writing to me Was this well doneBut I will not pretend to "set you Tasks" please yourself in that Particular and you'll please mefor this be assured of that Writing to me cannot be a more disagreeable Employment to you than Writing is at all Times and to all Persons to me I have made a strange Jumble of this Writing between you and me but I will give you Demonstration that I don't like  it  by concluding like the Story of the Bear and Fiddle  Adeiu  LETTER XC  My dear  PET  I AM sorry for what you hint at about Mrs and can't help giving you a Speculation or two upon this Head tho' you have forbidden me just to give you a little better Notion of the World than you have at present and in order also to make your Mind somewhat easier with Regard to her Behaviour to you  Persons who set up for Advisers arrogate to themselves Perfection at least a high Preference to their Pupils which with Regard to her and you would be Perfection Now as most People's Pride is superior to their Friendship it is a great Humbling of one to find the fancied Superiority not acknowledged by the Counsel not being regarded and we would rather our Friends gained one Advantage by our Advice than twenty by taking their own Way Another Reflection to be considered is that those Persons whom  Will Honeycomb  calls the outrageously virtuous notwithstanding their boasted Goodness have at Heart a jealous Envy against those whom they suspect to have Sense or Spirit enough to enjoy any Pleasure or make Advantage of any Occurrence of Life which  perhaps for Want of Sollicitation proper Circumstance of Time and Place or more generally for Want of Courage they may have missed themselves Observe that I speak all along in general Terms of human Nature in general for Mrs thinks she has a great deal of Friendship for you and I believe she has She may also imagine she would rather lie in Mr 's Arms than in the Embraces of  Apollo  and perhaps she would there are Enthusiasms of all Kinds and yet her Behaviour to you may be fairly deduced from one or both of the general Reflections just mentioned unconscious to herself for it is not every Person even of the best Sense who acts that knows from what Principle he acts I could pursue this Subject a great deal farther but shall conclude it here by assuring you sincerely that you shall for ever find from my Behaviour toward you that I shall endeavour to make you what Amends may be in my Power for the Loss of a Friend which perhaps I was the Occasion of And here pray let me be vain enough to wish you Joy as well as myself upon the Exchange for both it seems you could not have thro' her Niggardliness Meer downright Friendship is like a very moral Discourse which if continued for any Time is apt to grow lethargick but Love with Friendship mixed is like a sensible Conversation enlivened  by Sallies of Wit which keeps us awake during a very long Feast In short Friendship is the Enjoyment of Men but Love of Gods In the whole Heathen Mythology I dont remember an Instance of Friendship but every God had his Amour except  Vulcan  who being in every Thing unlike a God save Immortality was married and it is said  Venus  has made that God subscribe himself a Devil  as he is generally painted with Horns My Love to  Kitty    I am sincerely and affectionately Your's  LETTER XCI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I RECEIVED your Reflections moral and entertaining and must acknowledge that Truth dwells in themthey have made me wiser but not happier and I much fear that is all the most refined Philosophy can do  Ah if she lend not Arms as well as Rules  What can she more than tell us we are Fools  Teach us to mourn our Natures not to mend  A sharp Accuser but an helpless Friend  For my own Part I look upon it as an Impossibility that I should ever be happy in Love or Friendship my Sentiments are vastly too quick as well as delicate to hope for a Return  I thank you for the Exchange you offer me but as I flatter'd myself I was long since possessed of your Regard I am not much pleased to find it is still to dispose ofI honestly confess I never had an Equivalent to offer for it but always looked on it as a valuable Present made in the genteelest Manner by accepting such a Trifle as my Esteem in Return and calling it an ExchangeI am however to thank you for the Promise you make and assure you on my Honour that it is in your Power and your's only to make me ample Amends for the Loss I have sustained  My Aunt is not come to Town I am still a Wanderer I was Fool enough to tell you in my last Letter that I was alarmed at your missing a Postbut you will make me wise in Time  I fear the  Inconstancy  of the Weather has removed  Paraclete  even from the tottering Situation I left it in I did suspect  a sudden Gust  would carry it away It was built too  high  to be at all  permanent  all its Strength was in the  Attic  Story the Foundation was indeed a  slight  oneHowever since the Remembrance or rather  Imagination  of it is all that now remains  I beg it as a Favour that you will collect the best  Plan  you can from the  Ruins  and send it to me  I was pleased with a Sentiment I this Morning met with in the  Spectator  and tho' I am sure there is nothing new in it to you I will transcribe it because it leads me to ask a Question I am perhaps too sollicitous about  We travel thro' Time as thro' a Country filled with wild and empty Wastes which we would fain hurry over that we may arrive at those several little Settlements or imaginary Points of Rest that are dispersed up and down in it  You see  Addison  has agreed with me that  Time like Space is marked only by its Limits  if you wish in the metaphorical Sense of the Expression to add Length to my Days tell me when shall we meetLike  Leonora  you  can make Time long  but you can do much more for you can shorten it  I would apologize for a foolish inconsistent Letter extremely ill written but that I am sure you have received several from me every Whit as bad and may in all Probability do so againIf you can remember  Boileau  's Ode which you lately quoted I shall thank you for transcribing it in your next  Adieu  Frances  LETTER XCII  TELL me my dear inconsistent  Harry  what can be the Meaning of your Silence I account for it a thousand different Ways in an Hour but if I may give Credit to your repeated Vows and my own presaging gloomy Soul I have infinitely more Cause to condole with than complain of you I wrote to you last  Tuesday  Night but was ashamed to send my Letter as the Occasion of it was a DreamYou cannot conceive how miserably superstitious it has made meI have been here these two Days but tho' in the Court of  Comus  Joy has been an intire Stranger to my Heart which is continually filled with melancholy Ideas of my dear  Harry  's Want of Health for sure nothing else could have prevented him from telling me that he received my last Tho' I determined on leaving this Tonight I would not defer enquiring into this Mystery 'till I got I was going to say home but alas I have none lest it should be too late to tell you that I feel the severest Pain from thinking you are ill I dare not ask myself whether I would not rather it was Want of Health than Tenderness that occasioned your Neglecting to writeI know not what I write from the double Fear and Distraction of  my Thoughts Mr sits close by my Side and thinks I am writing to my Aunt How shall I direct my LetterThe Servant waits Adieu my dear  Harry  may Restoration hang its Medicine on my Pen either to your Health or my Indifference  LETTER XCIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    THE Reason you did not or perhaps may not for the Future hear from me so punctually as in our former Correspondence is that I do not receive my Letters so regularly now as formerly for in strict Obedience to your Commands I have given Directions to the Postmaster not to give my Letters to any Person but myself or my Order which occasions some Delay when I am at which is a great Way from the PostTown So it was the Indisposition of Circumstance not of my Health which occasioned what I am pleased to hear you call a Disappointment I wish my  Calphurnia  would have better Dreams for I have been Thanks to you my dear  Hygea  in perfect Health since I saw you as the Recovery of your Love and Favour have fully restored  my Spirits which and Health reciprocally depend upon each other Nay I am grown quite gay and  Since I am crept in Favour with myself  I will maintain it at some little Cost  I have declared for Assemblies here and am "your only Jigmaker" to the Astonishment of all my Acquaintance I bebeau'd myself t'other Night and went to a Ball but soon found out that it was not the Amusement I was in Quest of The Women for whose Sake alone I powdered talked like Children more in Simplicity than Innocence and were dressed like Puppets more showy than fine However this Tawdriness tho' we may call it Poverty confessed does not offend me so much as what I have often stiled a Pedantry of Dress which Persons of better Fortune than Taste are apt to run into When I see any one dressed very fine without being genteel I compare them to a Man of Learning without Sense which makes his Want of Understanding more conspicuous as the Want of Taste is more manifest in the other With such Reflections as these I soon rendered myself unfit for the gay Place I was in So very quickly retired home with this Observation that the Joy Happiness or Pleasure which elevates our Spirits upon some Occasions does not support us thro' every Scene where Mirth is necessary  The Gaiety of giddy Youth alone can be able to effect this but in all rational People the Mirth or Chearfulness of most Things must flow from the particular Pleasure we find in the Things themselves Therefore I shall never again mistake that joyous Spirit which the Thoughts of you raises in my Heart for such a Lightness of Mind as can make me revel in Balls and Masquerades but rather what makes me more eminently unfit for such Amusements  I am  my dearest Companion and most charming Correspondent  Your's in Sense and Truth Henry  I send you the Ode you desired as well as I can recollect it  Voici les Lieux charmants où mon âme ravi Passoit à contempler  Silvié    Ces tranquilles Moments si doûcement perdues  Que je L'aimois alors que je La trouvois belle  Mon Coeur vous soupirez aù Nom de L'Infidelle  Avez vous oublié que vous ne L'aimois plus  Cest ici que souvent parmi ces prairies  Ma Main des fleurs les plus cheris  Lui faisoit des presens si tendrement receus  Que je L'aimois alors que je La trouvois belle  Mon Coeur voussoupirez aù Nom de L'Infidelle  Avez vous oublié que vous ne L'aimois plus  LETTER XCIV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    YOU will I dare say be heartily frighted at the enormous Size of my Packet But as it is the Privilege of great Wits to say much in a little so it is the Custom of small ones to say nothing in a great deal I have so often illustrated the latter Part of this Trueism that it is needless to say more on this little Occasion I must intreat you will be so kind as to forward the Inclosed as soon as you receive it I fear it has already been too long delayed  I am sincerely glad that you are well and happy and shall hereafter say with  Caesar  "We defy Augury"  I have often thought with you that the Satisfaction arising from a particular Object or  Circumstance is more apt to disqualify us for what the Generality of the World call Pleasure than even Grief or Pain as in the first Case the Mind is totally absorbed in one Contemplation without endeavouring to exert its Faculties on Objects less pleasing than those which already employ itIn the Latter we are attempting to rouse the Mind and trying to find Ease or Pleasure from every new Object or untried Folly that surrounds us Alas how vain the Effort  I can at last with great Pleasure inform you that I am writing by my own Fireside I am certain we should never enjoy the Pleasures or Conveniencies of Life did we not sometimes feel the Want of them The unsettled disagreeable Way I have been in ever since I came to Town has endeared Home so much that I think I would rather live in a Cottage where I was Mistress of myself than be a Visiter at  Versailles    Need I tell my Heart's dear  Harry  with what Earnestness and Sincerity I wish to see him here You and you alone can double every Charm I find in the rational Enjoyment of myself and every Thing about meMy Aunt is still in the Country  Kitty  remains in  BondStreet  The Gaiety of that Place is better suited to her chearful Disposition than my retired Pleasures for in  those  Views and  those  only Pleasure can be called my AssociateI here release the Postmaster of for I would rather my Letters should be read by the whole County than not be punctually answered by you  May your Heart beat Time to the gay Life you are engaged in may the Women talk sensibly and dress elegantly and may every one you meet with be as perfectly agreeable as you are to your  sincerely affectionate Frances  LETTER XCV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED your Packet and sent it off to my Sister  Your Manner of accounting for the Pleasure we receive from one Object rather disqualifying us for other Pleasures more than even Grief or Pain is very just and very pretty I found out the Truth from Experience But you did more by investigating the Cause from Reason This churlish Pleasure tho' must be such a one as I receive from you one which makes every other appear below my Regard But why do I call it one Pleasure when it comprehends the best Part of the highest Pleasures of Sense Reason or Reflection The greatest Happiness in this Life proceeds from Love  and Friendship how much more exquisite the Joy when both these are centered in the same Object as one Jewel tho' but equal in Size to two others rises infinitely in Value above them Let this be a Lesson to those coy Fair ones who suffer a Man to break his Heart before they accept on't One Heartwhole Lover is worth fifty whining Inamorato's  I am just come from to catch the Post going out  Adieu  Henry  LETTER XCVI  I SHOULD have wrote to my dear  Harry  last Post but was prevented by Illness I am now thank God a great deal better so will not trouble you with an Account of my Malady  I am much obliged to you for the romantick Gallantry you hint at in your last but in order to make a proper Return to so much Politeness I must assure you tho' I long with the utmost Earnestness to see you here it would rather give me Pain than Pleasure to think I was the sole Motive of your Coming I do not know but Pride may have a large Share in this Declaration for I confess I have not Humility enough in my Disposition to be pleased with receiving FavoursHowever my Vanity is much delighted  with the Compliment and insists on its remaining as it is a very genteel one  I hope I did not wrong you with Regard to  Paraclete  I should indeed be sorry it had a more solid Foundation than Fancy as we could in that build as pretty a Castle as any two People I know  I live toute Seul yet am as happy in mine own dear Home as my Health will permit I am grown quite a domestick Animal and have found out that the Reason we who pursue rarely find Happiness is because she is too near us and "hides behind her Ardour to be seen" for she very seldom lives from HomeI expect  Kitty  will exchange the Pleasure I have found in conversing with myself for a much higher that of conversing with her She is to come to me next Week and tho' from being too long immersed in Crowds and Hurry I have acquired a Kind of Passion for Loneliness I shall be sincerely glad of her Company but I much fear my Disposition which from the long Series of Disappointments and Mortifications I have met with is grown quietly gloomy will be but ill suited to her lively Gaiety However some say that Contrasts in Friendship like Sympathies in Love cement the Union I hope it will do so with usMy Aunt came to Town last NightI have no Kind of News to send you and my Spirits are so extremely  low that I fear my Epistle will be contagious and give you the Humdrums which have at present taken entire Possession of  Your sincere Friend and Servant  LETTER XCVII  Dear  HARRY  I HAVE received both your Letters I did not get that of the th 'till  Sunday  Morning let me beg you not to write by the Stage again for I hate Delays I wrote to you last  Saturday  on the same Subject I am now to treat of but as you desire I should be explicit I obey  And first let me again thank you for your designed Visit and again assure you that with neverceasing Earnestness I wish nay long to see you here But as I ever did and ever shall prefer your Ease and Happiness to my own I must insist on your not contributing to mine at the Expence of your's  In the most romantick Hours of my Life when every Instance of Tenderness transported me I well remember to have received more Pain than Pleasure from a parallel Proof of your Regard and to deal frankly with you which indeed I think you merit it is neither in my Power nor Inclination to make the Returns which I fear you would expect for such a Favour Let me intreat you then my dear  Harry  not to give yourself and me fruitless Trouble but wait 'till Time or Business produces some lucky Event which may render your Coming necessary to yourself and of Course pleasing to meWhenever that happens I will with the utmost Pleasure meet you at whatever Distance you shall appoint from Town with a Female Companion provided we can settle it so as not to interfere with my domestick Affairs and be assured that every Moment of my Life which can be spared from those shall be bestowed on you This is indeed no Compliment as I know no other Method of spending it with Satisfaction to myself  I now solemnly declare that by declining your intended Kindness I debar myself of the only Pleasure I am capable of receiving for all other Enjoyments  have lost the Power to charm my Soul  Do not then unkindly construe my Regard for your Welfare into Caprice or cruelly say that I don't desire to see youtoo well you know I do  You do me but strict Justice in believing that the most minute Matter relative to you must ever be of Consequence to me and since you have touched on Family Affairs you must give me Leave to tell you that I am extremely concerned for poor  Nancy  When I was at  Belvidere  I pitied her as much as I ever did any Creature for tho' I cannot suppose her  capable of that exquisite Anguish which more cultivated Minds must feel she could not avoid Suffering greatly from a Certainty of  Sally  's being the reigning Favourite If the Want of an elevated Mind prevented her feeling the "  Hydra  of Calamities" in the most poignant Manner it likewise deprived her of the only Resource which can be found for the Forsaken that of scorning the perjured Lover but she poor Soul pointed her misplaced Rage at her triumphant Rival forgetting the nine Hundred and ninetynine Damsels who must have been dethroned before she took Possession of the capacious Empire of your Heart  I am really sorry her Behaviour obliged you to part with her she was a good Servant and I believe sincerely attached to your Interest notwithstanding Mr 's Report to the Contrary  I cannot say how much I am obliged by your Writing so constantly let me intreat you will continue to deserve my sincerest Thanks for they are all that I can offer in Return It is not Want of Gratitude but Power that prevents my repaying the Obligation you must then like a compounding Creditor accept all I have to give tho' it falls ever so short of the Debt  I again intreat you to believe that I passionately long to see you and that I am with the sincerest Affection  Your's and only Your's  LETTER XCVIII  ParacleteMichaelmasDay  My dearest and bestloved Love  YOUR Manner of Writing about my going to  London  charms me extremely as it is very sensible and rational It flatters me too as it is somewhat in the Stile I have always treated you for I would never sacrifice one Sentiment of Friendship to all the Extravagance of Love for which Reason to ordinary Seeming I might perhaps appear not to have loved you half as well as I really did However that may be I do solemnly assure you upon my Word of Honour which when seriously given I never forfeited to you yet that from the Instant I first saw you here I have loved and approved you better than I ever did before and such a Turn at this Stage of our Acquaintance is very likely to last for Life  Amen  so be it  There is something however in your Manner which sometimes perplexes me As for Example in the two recent Instances of  Paraclete  and my going to  London  you speak of  Things which you seem to desire and when I think you in Earnest as I generally do my own Inclinations according with your's you then tell me you did not seriously intend what you hinted at But I am not to be trifled with after this Manner For whatever I undertake in Complaisance to you I shall certainly go thro' with in Compliance with my own Inclinations So I shall certainly pay my Visit to you in  London  soon in Hope you will return the Compliment to  Paraclete  next Summer  I hope you rejoice in the same Weather we have in the Country we have not had even the Whisper of a  Michaelmas  Rig yet and  October  which is generally a fine Month is setting in with all good Omens There is something more charming in a fine Season at this Time of the Year than in all the Sunshine of a Summer's Meridian Methinks it affects us somewhat like the pleasing Reverence we feel when we meet with Chearfulness in the Decline of Life I hope this Weather will continue 'till I see you  Bear me but to her then fail me if you can  Not that I am such a fair Weather Spark that the Difference of Season shall make any Difference in my stedfast Purpose to see you as soon as I can  Nor yet the Wint'ry Blasts I fear  Nor Storms nor Night shall keep me here  I am my Dearest your's 'till I see you and 'till I can see you no more  LETTER XCIX  NEED I tell my dear  Harry  that his Letter gave me the highess Pleasure as the utmost Wish my Heart e'er formed was to be approved by him Let us now mutually congratulate each other on our Coming to a right Understanding for I am persuaded that great Part of those Uneasinesses we have both given and received have been owing to our not being thoroughly acquainted with the Motives on which we separately acted I may have misconstrued Friendship into Want of Tenderness and you deemed that Caprice which was Excess of Love However this I am sure of that we either love one another extremely well or we must be a Couple of the proudest and most obstinate Mortals that ever yet existed I sincerely hope that our mutual Perseverance is owing to the first Cause as it is most for the Honour of human Nature in general and of us two in particular  I am sincerely grateful for the kind Assurance you give me of still increasing Love If every Thought Word or Action of my Life being devoted to you and you only can merit a Con+tinuance of your Regard I may venture to promise that it will last for Life and  that our Loves and Comforts will increase even as our Days do grow  As to that Part of my Conduct which you say perplexes you it is mighty easily accounted for I have perhaps more Romance in my Disposition than any Woman you may have met with for this Reason my Mind is ever filled with Ideas out of the common Road Whims which have any Degree of Tenderness or Delicacy please me extremely and I am apt to indulge them perhaps too much but when any Circumstance recalls the Remembrance of my Situation in Life I am immediately sorry for having given Way to my Folly and would retrieve it if I could But not to appear more variable than I really am I submit the Being or Annihilation of  Paraclete  intirely to you If you seriously think that my Aunt's Living there will add to your Happiness and not hurt my Fame I will again with Transport indulge my Heart with  Those Scenes of Bliss my raptur'd Fancy fram'd  In that dear Spot with Peace and thee retir'd  Tho' Reason then my sanguine Fondness blam'd  I'll still adhere to what my Love inspir'd  I insist on your answering me like the Man of Honour and the Friend The Lover must not have the smallest Part in your Reply  I do indeed rejoice with you and for you on Account of the Weather I never see a  Gleam of Sunshine or a clear Sky that does not afford me a double Pleasure by reflecting how much you enjoy it I would recommend it to you to stay in the Country while the Weather holds good assured of this that when  Sol  withdraws his Influence and refuses longer to chear us miserable Mortals you can more than supply his Absence by clearing those Glooms which even his chearful Rays cannot dispel without you  I have such a violent Pain in my right Shoulder that it is with the utmost Difficulty I move my Hand to write I am still une pauvre Solitaire  Kitty  has not yet left  BondStreet  nor do I know when she will  If I were able I would write another Letter and not send this for it is indeed a miserable Scrawl tho' as my Letters have been always Originals not Copies I think it would be illtimed to begin with Forms when I should leave them off  As to the Affair of  Nancy  and  Sally  it is of no farther Consequence to me than if  James  and the Coachman had been the Disputants Nor did I mention my Opinion of  Sally  with any Design for you may easily conceive that it is a Matter of Indifference to me whether your present Favourite was christened  Sarah  or  Anne  for while I am in Possession of the Jewel that is lodged within I care not who holds the Casket  Oh free for ever be his Eye  Whose Heart to me is always true  I have quotted these Lines to you before upon some such Occasion  Adieu my dear  Harry  and believe me as I am faithfully and affectionately  Your's  LETTER C  HENRY  to  FRANCES    YOU have distinguished very justly about the Disadvantages under which my Friendship and your Love have hitherto appeared to each other but they have both approved themselves of the best and most lasting Kind upon the Tests I have often mentioned to you that I should always preserve the same constant Tenor in my Behaviour toward you behaved you to me well or ill  True as the Dial to the Sun  Altho' it be not shin'd upon  and that if you once truly loved me whatever might happen in the Course of our Lives might perhaps interrupt but could never break the Chain Yet to say the Truth these convertible or reciprocal Terms of Love and Friendship have been so often commuted converted and compounded between us that they are now  become according to a  Latin  Sentence I have  unde nescio  met with  Utrum horum mavis accipe sive utrumque  and between us two have come to so near a Resemblance to each other that my Friendship from a constant unallayed Heat begins now to blaze into a Flame and the Extravagance of your Passion seems to have spent itself to  The calm Lights of mild Philosophy  and like the pure aetherial Spirit can subsist without Matter And here I must impose another  Latin  Sentence upon you from  Ovid  Quod nunc ratio est impetus ante fuit  Your saying that you rejoice now in fine Weather tho' all Seasons are equal to those who live in Town because you know the Pleasure I receive from it in the Country puts me in Mind of a Pair of romantic Lovers who agreed at Parting that at such an Hour of the Night they would each take a solitary Walk by Moonlight enjoying a whimsical Kind of Happiness in that they were both employed in contemplating the same Object at the same Time Such Instances as these to Persons who never were in Love may perhaps appear very ridiculous but the charming Caprices of this delightful Passion like the Taste which Men of a refined Genius have for the politer Arts and Sciences are as incomprehensible to Persons of  an ordinary Capacity as the Objects of a sixth Sense  My lovely loving and beloved Fair one  farewell  Henry  LETTER CI  Dear  HARRY  I Have entered upon the Study you prescribed to me and have read  Tully  's  Offices  almost thro' and I profess myself both pleased and surprized at finding to what a noble Height of virtuous Sentiment an uninlightened  Pagan  has carried the Point of Morals Truth and Justice There are some extreme nice Cases put in dealing between Man and Man in which  Cicero  has determined so differently from the general Practice and allowed Opinions of the mercantile World that a Person must have a very refined and abstracted Speculation who will readily join Issue with his Reasonings  I see now more than ever the Disadvantage in Morals which People must labour under who have not had the Happiness of a liberal and academic Education who have not secured a thorough Knowledge of Books before they venture upon any Acquaintance or Commerce with the World For it is in early Youth before Ideas are crowded or complexed while the Fancy is lively quick to receive and amorous  to retain the delicate Sensations that the moral Beauty of abstract Virtue can be able to impress its Image on the Mind and you might as well attempt to give a Man of Thirty a Taste for the nice and inexpressible Graces of Poetry Painting or Music as to teach a Merchant a Relish for the Refinements of  Cicero    However I must confess that the more I am pleased with this Author and others of the same heathen Class the more alarmed I find myself on Account of the Christian Religion which tho' allowed to be the finest and noblest System of Ethics that ever was framed I really can't perceive any thing more in than was said wrote and practised before the  Augustan  Period I have often heard Hints of the same Kind upon this Subject in Conversation but they never made the least Impression on me before because they never came from any Person whom I did not observe to be deficient either in Sense or Virtue Now do not imagine from any thing I say that I am in the least staggered with Regard to my Faith in our holy Religion but as we should upon all Occasions be ready to give an Account of the Faith that is in us I shall be obliged if you will take the Trouble to render me the Reason or Necessity for that Revelation which without having ever inquired about I most stedfastly and implicitly believe in Your Hours of Retirement and  Leisure have not been unemploy'd upon these Subjects and you are my  Abelard  my only Orthodoxy in speculative Points  LETTER CII  My dear  HELOISE  I Received your clever Letter upon those Subjects which I left you conversant about And tho' I have already given you every Book from my Study which I presumed might adorn a Lady's Library I believe I shall soon be obliged to thin my Shelves farther and call in Aid from the  Cotton  Musaeum to supply you  Your Criticism upon Taste is fine and puts me in Mind of a very judicious Remark I have somewhere met with upon  Julius Scaliger  who was allowed to be a Man of great Learning and deep Erudition but is observed to be but an heavy Commentator upon the inimitable Elegancies of the Classics  for that he applied himself to his Studies somewhat too late in Life  There are in moral Virtue certain Graces which it is not in the Power of Ethic Rules to prescribe analogous to the Jenesçayquoi of natural Beauty which the most descriptive Poetry cannot express and which a Person can be only capable of perceiving from a sort of Sympathy of Soul as refined  Spirits are supposed to communicate their Ideas rather by Intuition than Converse  Your Expression of  amorous to retain  is fine and one Instance among many in your Writings of that poetical Elegance which you allude to  I am not prepared to enter into a Treatise upon the Subject you have started but shall throw together a few unconnected Hints after the Manner of a CommonPlaceBook which is the only Way I can have Patience to write in  Religion may be considered but as moral Virtue reduced to Method as human Laws are but a Compendium of Equity Moral Virtue its Truth and Beauty like the Rays of the Sun are too weak and diffuse for many the best Purposes of Life but Religion like a BurningGlass collects those scattered Rays giving them united Force and more particular Direction  From the Light of Nature a few ingenious Philosophers might have deduced perhaps the Whole of revealed Ethics but their Writings could have but a flight and confined Influence over the Generality of Mankind Reasoning may convince our Minds but human Nature requires Authority to govern and controul its Actions Rewards and Punishments are not clear from the Light of Nature tho' they may  be presumed from the Analogy running thro' all the Works of Providence The Time at least could not be ascertained 'till Revelation denounced it to be immediately consequent of our Death so that before that Revelation Men might perhaps presume upon the Possibility of some farther State of Probation Nay what Certainty of an Hereafter upon any Terms could we have without Revelation  One great Comfort in this frail mortal Life was wanting from the Reasonings of Natural Religion which the Christian System has assured us of namely Remission upon Repentance and this has not only informed us of one darling Attribute more in the Godhead but has saved Sinners from the Misery and Danger of Despair  Why the great God has thought proper to make his Revelations so partially both with Regard to Time and Place in such and such a Manner the Mystery of the Incarnation the Passion with other Articles of Faith are too abstruse to enter into here Besides they more properly belong to what they call systematical Divinity and I shall let them rest 'till I am at Leisure to recommend proper Books for your Reading to instruct you in such speculative Subjects So having sufficiently answered as much of this Matter as your Letter required I shall only add this short Prayer  That we  may both live in Hope that we may die in Certainty  Adeiu  LETTER CIII  My dear  CONFESSOR  I Received your's but it has not answered my Expectations tho' you say it has answered my Letter Now I forget how fully I expressed myself there but I know I had more in Contemplation when I wrote than you have taken Notice of and pray observe there is a great Difference between answering a Question and solving a Difficulty  I remember  La Bruyere  gives the Character of a famous  French  Wit who made it a Rule with himself never to seem posed upon any Occasion whatsoever and being asked a little abruptly once What was the Difference between  Dryads  and  Hamadryads  answered very readily  You have heard of your Bishops and Archbishops  I had this Story from yourself some Time ago upon somewhat a similar Occasion and I must therefore confess the Pertness of my Reapplication and by Way of Apology for it I shall add the old Proverb That a Fool may ask more Questions than a wise Man can answer However I acknowledge that you have said  enough to loosen the Difficulty tho' not intirely to resolve it and for the rest I am satisfied to throw myself upon Faith  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CIV  Dear  FANNY  I Have read  Tom Jones  at your Request and return it to you with my Opinion upon it which you likewise require  The Novel is a true Copy of human Life the Characters thoroughly kept up to the Story well told the Incidents humourous the Sentiments noble and the Reflections just and moral  The only Fault I find with the Author is the illjudged Attempts he often makes to be witty which being by no Means his Talent and in a Work of this Kind wholly unnecessary he is therefore inexcusable if it should turn out as it frequently does here in poor Allusions bald Conceits or wretched Puns  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    MY not hearing from you these two Posts shall be no Reason for my not writing to  you for I do it for the Pleasure I have in addressing you after any Manner not because I think myself under a Necessity of answering you  You may remember the  Spectators  were in my Course of Reading when you was here and t'other Day I met a Paper of  Addison  's the d Paper of the th Volume which supports my Justification of  Pope  against your Censure  That there were but few Lines in his Works his own  Part of his  Preface  to his own Works too may be taken in  Every one who reads expects their Authors should be Scholars and yet are angry when they find them so  Is not your Action your own because it is as just and graceful as Lady 's  I have sometimes observed to you the great Inconvenience of a good Memory which Persons of the best Understandings or greatest Reading are seldom incumbered with by which Means whatever they read becomes their own by improving their Minds without burthening their Memories and like Persons who have studied Mathematics being once convinced of a Demonstration ever after retain the Truth tho' the  A's  and  B's  which explained it to them are forgot There is something analogous to Digestion in Learning One Person shall turn all he eats and drinks to sound Flesh and florid Complexion while another Person of a  disordered or weakly Constitution shall quote you a Piece of Partridge or Pheasant after every Meal  I beg to hear from you as soon as possible for I am afraid the Delay is owing to the Pain in your Arm you mentioned in one of your Letters  Your constant and affectionate Henry  LETTER CVI  I Think myself vastly obliged to dear  Harry  for his obliging Voluntier I wish it was in my Power to make him a better Return than meer Thanks but indeed that is all I have to offer for I am absolutely grown so intolerably stupid and have such a confirmed Aversion to Writing that I hate the Thoughts of touching a Pen conscious that it must be as tiresome to you to read as it is to me to write Let my Want of Power plead my Excuse and kindly accept of the Will for the Deed  I have not had Leisure enough since I received your's to look for the Paper you mention You mistake my Opinion with Regard to  Pope  I did not say his Verse was not his own but that he was only a Versifier and as his Thoughts and Expressions are I think more elegant than any of our  English  Poets I cannot help being sorry that he did not strike out  something of his own and not intirely confine his Genius to Translating or Versifying the Plans marked out by other Men for this Reason I think he had less Merit tho' more Charms than many of our  English  Writers as the Masons who built  Belvidere  had in my Mind no more Pretence to Taste or Elegance than if they had built a Barn  For when some lofty Pile is rais'd  We never hear the Workmen prais'd  Who bring the Lime or place the Stones  But all admire  Inigo Jones    Had I ever seen Lady it is certain I should have endeavoured to copy her I am glad I did not for I don't know that I ever yet saw a good Imitation for what may be elegantly graceful in one Person may appear ridiculously aukward in another  Your Remark with Regard to Memory is verified in me for I know no one that has a better than myself and it is indeed very often a great Incumbrance to me in more Cases than one  Mrs has been very well received by her FatherinLaw in  Wales  and is all so happy I sincerely rejoice at it tho' indeed she does not deserve I should give myself a Moment's Thought about her She had wrote several Letters to  Kitty  and others not a Line to me I am sorry to say she has descended to  little Meannesses I thought her incapable of particularly that of divulging every Passage relative to you herself and me with  Notes Variorum  on the Folly of my being again reconciled to you and many dreadful Prophecies on the ConsequenceI hope she will not prove a  Cassandra    I told you in my last Letter how my Time was employed I have not been any where from Home but at the  Park  this Fortnight The Pain in my Arm which you are so kind as to think of turned out to be the Rheumatism I was much worse after I wrote to you but by the Help of Patience and Warmth without Flannel which I hate I am now pretty well  I am surprized at your mentioning any Delay on my Side I have answered every one of your Letters by the next Post if you have not got them there must be some Blunder at your PostOffice You are extremely kind not to stand on Form You can never write out of Time I may Your Letters always give me Pleasure mine cannot afford you any yet are at this Time a higher Compliment than when they were perhaps more entertaining I hate Writing because I know I cannot write However I would not have you imagine that I think this Selfmortification too high a Price for your Correspondence I am only concerned that I have not an equivalent Return to make But this be  assured of that what I want in Expression is made up in Friendship and Affection for you Let my Actions supply the Place of Words and prove me  Ever Your's  LETTER CVII  I Received a Letter from you pleading your Incapacity of writing in the same Stile that  Jeremy  is said to exclaim against Wit in Love for Love which is our Comedy also But you must get somebody else indeed almost any body else to make your Apology on that Head for you can't avoid betraying yourself in your Defence In short my charming Girl you can never hope to be excused on this Subject for nothing but your Writing ill shall make me forgive your Neglect  I am sorry for Mrs 's Behaviour to you but am pleased to find you mention it as becomes you more in Concern than Picque which truly shews in you more Generosity and Virtue than she was ever capable of There is in her Censures of you a vast Air of the old Maid and tho' poor Mr for his Sins has rid her of that Reproach yet the terrible Apprehensions she some Time laboured under of that forlorn State have so soured her Morals that she wants nothingbut Witto be an excellent  Satirist The little Meannesses she has been guilty of in mentioning your Name convince me of the Truth of my Remarks about her in a late Letter for her Behaviour really shews more Picque for herself than friendly Concern for you Butfareherwellfor a  PseudoMaga  Notwithstanding what you say against poor  Pope  I am very well satisfied he has said many Things of his own nay many Things are his own tho' they perhaps were said before Now I am upon this Subject of Criticism I can't help observing to you that my Thought of a  divided Heart  and  Suckling  's of a  broken LookingGlass  being compared to each other was owing to a small Error only of mistaking Multiplication for Division  See Letter    I shall by the End of this Week have finished the earliest and the largest Sowing of any Man in this County Sixtythree Acres of Corn exactly one Third of my Demesne unploughed when you was here and all limed at eighty Barrels to an Acre After so much Labour and Fatigue I think I owe myself some Relaxation and shall then post up to  London  to see what Harvest you are making there which I shall share with you in order to provoke you to make Reprisals on mine here next Summer I am my dearest  Ever Your's Henry  LETTER CVIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I Am in Haste to dispatch my little Voluntier before the Post comes in lest your Letter should not leave me Room to say any Thing of my own for your Writings are generally so replete with Matter and Sentiment that it takes me up the full Extent of a Letter merely to answer your's so that there is hardly a Thought or Expression I can truly call my own except when I subscribe myself  Your Lover and your Friend  for that is a Sentiment which proceeds so naturally from my Heart that it would frequently occur whether you had wrote to me or no  I am well aware how far short these detached Essays will appear of the Papers of our regular Correspondence for this remarkable Reason that as natural Philosophers affirm the Statue to be originally in the Stone the Hammer and Chissel only clearing of the Rubbish so speculative Wits say that all Arts and Sciences are innate in the Mind and that an ingenious Querist may deduce the most abstruse Theorems of Mathematics Philosophy or Ethics from the Answers of a rational Respondent tho' ever so illiterate Our epistolary Converse I look upon in this  Socratical  Light insomuch that if I say any Thing which deserves to be taken  Notice of I may rather be said to have the Happiness to be inspired than to boast the Merit of Wit I have several Times since we founded the  Amourette  or  Paraclete  lamented that at your poetical Baptism you had not taken upon you  Le Nom d' Amour of Heloise  but upon Reflection I think it better became that Person who was lately stiled so as she indeed needed many Things to learn but  You strike each Point with native Force of Mind  While puzzled Learning labours far behind  and are fitter to be yourself the Preceptor than the Pupil For my Part I acknowledge to have been taught several Things by you but the most material and what pleases me most is that you have brought me to suspect that I never loved before I have Reason to think now that I formerly mistook a high Fever for that noble Passion and not being sensible of those Heartburnings and quick Pulses toward you which I had formerly felt for another I ingenuously confessed that the Love which makes such a Bustle in Romances was quite extinct in me However tho' I might have felt the  Passion  I think I never did the  Sentiment  before for your Charms  Inspire not Lust but elegant Desire  and are the exact Reverse of  Sidley  's Art as they  are capable of imparting the chastest Wishes to the loosest Heart and as  Milton  expresses it in refining upon sensual Pleasure can raise  the very  Spirit  of Love and amorous Delight  All my Family have been this Fortnight at attending my Sister's happy Minute which is not yet arrived and I have passed my Time here after a Manner I like best when I can't spend it with you I rise at Daybreak perform the Ambarvalia and divide the whole Daylight between my Ploughs and the Planting of my Trees never dine 'till Night then come in hungry cold and tired to a good Fire a Mutton Chop a Pint of Wine a Pinch of Snuff and a Book How often and how sincerely have I wished for you in this Retirement And what an Age it appears to me since I saw you last Which makes me suspect that Mr  Locke  's Assertion is not just for if Time is measured but by the Succession of Ideas how can your Absence appear tedious to me who have thought of nothing else but you There is something however in this disparted State which is not altogether unpleasant and shews the infinite Goodness of Providence and the Happiness of a Mind properly turned that there are Satisfactions and Emoluments even in the Misfortunes and Distresses of human Life and that we may as  Young  expresses it  Elaborate an artificial Happiness from Pains  And it is really my Opinion upon a good deal of Reflection that no Person was ever possessed of sublime Sense or Virtue who was incapable of melancholy Pleasures The Presence of those we love is like the Noon their Absence like the Even of Life which latter has I believe a good deal of that sort of Pleasure I have just mentioned  I am as I told you once before in this Letter both  Your Lover and your Friend Henry  LETTER CIX  FRANCES  to  HENRY    NOthing less than the extreme Pleasure I received from your last dear elegant Epistle could possibly have roused me from the lethargic Stupidity I have been lately immersed in  As after Winds of ruffling Wing the Sea subsiding slow settles into a Calm  But as I have already said it was such a one as I by no Means can boast of for it was from Passion being exhausted not the Power of Reason this Apathy arose But thy muchloved thy dear kind forming Hand  to healthful Measure has reduced and tempered the Rage of Pride the Felness of Revenge and all the weak Excesses of my Heart  Oh what a Charm has Flattery when it proceeds from those we truly love How far beyond Expression is the Pleasure I receive from your saying I am what I most wish to be For tho' I am not vain enough to fancy I have the least Pretence to those Praises you lavish on me yet as every Eye creates its own Charmer your kind Partiality may perhaps set my little Merits in such an advantageous Light as may render me pleasing to the single Person whose Approbation is of more Consequence to me than that of the united World  With Regard to myself I must differ from the Opinion you advance that  the Statue is originally in the Stone  for I am thoroughly conscious that I am more indebted to you for any amiable Quality which I may possess than to Nature Perhaps the first Sparks were formed by Nature but they lay as dead as Fire in Flint which can only be extracted by Steel What you have made accept of I am indeed a Creature of your own forming and therefore all your own But oh my dearest  Harry  remember that as you have raised the Sensations of my Mind to know the highest Happiness the human Heart can feel you have also rendered me capable of such Pains as would  make Hell superfluous  That you do love me I verily believe and the fond Hope that you will ever do so is all  the Hold I have of Happiness The charming Change you speak of in your Sentiments has transported me almost beyond my Senses To have you love me with Tenderness and Delicacy all gross Desires for ever banished from your Heart is Joy unspeakableNow and now only I begin to live and you to love  How earnestly how passionately do I languish to be a Partner in the rational Delight you mention to have the Essence of Wisdom Learning Eloquence and Truth from thy harmonious Tongue 'till raised by Gratitude and Rapture I catch my kind Instructor in my Arms and teach even him what it is to love Oh  Harry  why has not Fortune placed me in a Sphere to indulge my first my last my only Wish of being always and for ever your's From the Extremity of Joy my Heart is plunged in the severest Grief when I reflect that a few a very few Months will divide us perhaps for ever Oh I can't bear the ThoughtYou will forget me then no more remember that you once did love me or that I ever did and ever shall love youMy Heart is torn in Pieces with this ThoughtI'll not indulge it  As I am always pleased at your being engaged in any Pursuit that can be either useful or delightful to you I am charmed with your Passion for Planting I think it is  Addison  who says  There is something truly magnificent in  this kind of Amusement it gives a noble Air to several Parts of Nature it fills the Earth with a Variety of beautiful Scenes and has something in it like Creation for this Reason the Pleasure of one who plants is like that of a Poet who is more delighted with his own Productions than any other Writer or Artist whatsoever  I hope you'll pardon my Quotation as it is only meant to prove that the whole Study of my Life "true as the Needle to the Pole" tends to you only for I am well assured this Passage would have passed  unmarked by my unheeding Eye  had you not been ingaged in this noble Avocation In short I never take up a Book but with a Design of rendering myself more worthy of your personal or epistolary Converse I am well convinced that not all the Authors I can ever read will prevent my falling short of that  ne plus ultra  It is from you and you alone my dear Preceptor I must receive both Inspiration and Expression  From Lips like your's what Precepts fail to move  Too soon they taught me 'twas no Sin to love  I will with great Pleasure adopt the Name of  Heloise  provided you reassume that of  Abelard  she who lately had it might have a more intelligent Mind but not one so well calculated to  be your Pupil as I have for she wanted both Love and Respect for her Tutor  I have thought every Day increased in Length since you talked of coming to Town had I nothing to hope or fear it is highly probable I should have discovered every Day is shorter than the Day before but the nearer we approach to the Summit of our Wishes the intervening Space grows more tedious by Recollection of the past Fatigue  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CX  My dear  ELOISE  Paraclete    IF I had no other of the many Reasons I have to write to you this one would be sufficient that I observe my Letters have a good Effect upon your Spirits which gives me greater Pleasure and Pride than would the Applause of the World were I sure of gaining it by printing them  The Quotation you sent me on Planting is indeed from  Addison  in one of his Spectators for who can be in Doubt upon any Passage wrote by him What an infinite Difference there is between his Papers and any of the rest bound up with them What a Nobleness of Sentiment Justness of Thought Perspicuity of Stile Elegance of Expression and Propriety of  Language there is in all his Writings They say prudent Oeconomists should lay by something always out of their annual Income to avail themselves of upon any natural or accidental Emergency So I have marked several of  Addison  's Papers to be referred to on any extraordinary Distress or Misfortune of Life against Pain Sickness old Age Poverty the Hour of Death and the Day of Judgment In short meer Man is not able to support his Spirit under any of these Pressures and the Writings of several eminent Men are admirable Resources to strengthen Philosophy for the present and enliven Hope for the Future and a Collection of Pieces from several Authors in this Stile which may not improperly be intitled "The Cordial of Adversity" would be a very useful Work on many Occasions in Life  I am carrying on my Plantations with as much Diligence but not with the same Spirit as before I was then in Hopes of seeing you here and now I almost despair of that Pleasure the Genius of the Place is fledfor what Inspiration can I expect from hidebound Hamadryads when the  Diana  of the Woods is gone  Fear not my dearest Girl that either Distance of Place or Time shall ever make me forget to love you for it was ever my greatest Pleasure and shall be always my greatest Pride  to acknowledge myself your Lover and your Friend  Abelard  LETTER CXI  Dearest  FANNY  I RECEIVED a lowspirited Letter from you last Post which I am sorry for and surprized at For I think it is a Condescension beneath your Pride and giving a Triumph to a base Enemy whose Malice would be impotent if you would exert the Spirit you have with any other Person's Temper But of these Matters more at MeetingI shall only infer an Observation I have often made which this Subject makes occur to me now that a Man must be qualified by Nature for every Thing the greatest and even the most insignificant Without this natural Endowment Power will turn to Tyranny Learning to Pedantry nay should a Man even pretend to dress without a Genius he can but accomplish himself a Fop  There is something insolent in that Fellow's Manners which plainly proves he was never designed for Government When a Person of such mean Original and worthless Qualities rises to any Rule or Power he may be compared in a witty Phrase of Doctor  South  's to a Scum at once the basest and the uppermost Part  Every Happiness on this Earth attend my dearest Girl  LETTER CXII  I HOPE my having been extremely harrassed with Business for this Week past will appear a sufficient Excuse to dear  Harry  for my not writing last Post I own the Reproof in your's of the d both just and gentle but I think Nature is in Fault not I For I would not let the present Vexation or any other chagrine me if I could help itbut I will have done with the Subject lest I should again demonstrate that it is in the Power of Trifles to make me uneasy  Your Letters can indeed lower or raise my Spirits as you please For I consider myself but as an Instrument in the Hands of a skilful Musician who can  sound me from my lowest Note to the Top of my Compass  I think your System of Preparation against the numberless disagreeable Occurrences of Life a very good one but then believe me it will only avail you in the ordinary Accidents which are common to all Men For where a Mind like your's meets with any uncommon Misfortune it is not turning to Authors that we know wrote well will afford us Consolation Such an Understanding as your's must suggest to itself whatever has been said on a parallel Occasion But alas how incapable is Wisdom of alleviating those Distresses which affect the Heart Mr  Addison  has said  there is no  Consolation for unhappy Love A fine Understanding and an elegant Taste add Strength to the Passion while that of all others most enervates them  For my own Part I know not where to apply myself for Courage or Constancy to support what I think infinitely more terrible than Death If your Study or Philosophy has found out a Method of parting with all we love without a Pang it will be but Charity to let me know it and tho' it may not perhaps work so perfect a Cure on me as you If it does but alleviate any Part of the Pain it will be of infinite Service to me The Parting of the Soul and Body tho' a Circumstance that we are from our Infancy inured to think of has shook the Courage of the greatest MenHow much more dreadful is it to be for ever separated from what we value much above ourselvesBut since it must be I will endeavour to summon all my Fortitude and learn from you to bear it as I ought for  in Sight of such a Pattern to persist ill suits a Person honoured with thy Love  The only Return I can make to the kind Assurance you give me is to make you the same Promise which I believe you will not doubt for  Of all Afflictions taught a Lover yet  'Tis sure the hardest Science to forget  Adieu my dear  Abelard  may you remember me while the Remembrance is grateful and when it ceases to be so forget  Your Eloise  LETTER CXIII  My dearest  HARRY  OUR Journey is fixed and I am distracted I know the Prudence of the Scheme in every Point and yet nothing but Necessity should make me stir I long to see you and yet wish it not For tho' I were to see you every Day and Hour I shall never be able to forget but for a Minute that I must leave  England  in  May  with a moral Certainty of never seeing it again Had not Fortune as it were rooted you to a peculiar Spot what I now look upon as the severest Kind of Banishment could give me but very little Pain for we are all Citizens of the WorldAs to my Loss you will not cannot feel it For in Reality it is none and it is as much impossible that you can ever want a more charming agreeable Friend as that you can ever find a sincererSoon very soon you will forget me while I alas a helpless Stranger in a foreign Land shall neither wish nor hope for Consolation for where or how or from whom should I receive it  All that remains after our last Adieu is to consider you as an Inhabitant of another World and myself in a local Purgatory where having proved my Faith and Constancy we shall be reunited again shall meet to part no more tho' there can be no Certainty that we shall know one another in a future State I think it is extremely consistent with human Reason to suppose we shall for I think it is arraigning the Wisdom of the Almighty to imagine that he should form us with Passions and Attractions for each other which more frequently produce Misery than Happiness in this Life and let those strongest noblest Faculties of the Soul perish with the Body in the Grave Noit cannot be they were ordained to answer higher Ends to make the everlasting Happiness of his Creatures and will exist to all Eternity Besides we are taught to believe that we must render an Account of our past Lives Sure  Love is the informing active Fire that kindles up the Mass  and is it not the highest Absurdity to suppose that when in a State of Perfection we shall remember the Effects but forget the Cause I would not lose this Hope for any Certainty the World could give me Oh my bestloved my ever dear and charming Friend part when we will we have an Eternity to spend together and tho' I do not flatter myself with holding the first or  highest Place in your Regard I dare boast of as sincere as tender and as constant an Affection for you as ever  faithful Woman felt or false one feigned  and there where all the Mists of Error shall be cleared away  our Forms transparent naked every Thought  a Passion such as mine must have some Claim  As to what you mention with Regard to Fortune give me Leave to assure you in the most solemn Manner that were your's equal to your utmost Wish it should not make any Alteration in mine I love you much too well were it in my Power to buy my Happiness at the Price of your's and whatever Idea you may have formed of my Sentiments for you I swear by that allseeing Power who knows my inmost Thoughts that Fortune never had the smallest Share in my unchangeable Affection for you and could you seat me on a Throne this Moment it might add to my Gratitude but could not to my Love The sole Concern I have ever had about your Fortune with Regard to myself was that it's not being as easy as you could wish might perhaps engage you to enter into a Situation which must render my Affection for you criminal This I own has often filled my Heart with Sorrow and my Eyes with Tears as the constant Result of this Thought was a fixed Resolution never to see you more But when I have considered it would  be for your Happiness I quickly found I could give up my ownAll Reflections of this Kind are now over and since the longfeared fatal Separation must arrive I think I could without betraying any Weakness hear you were married to a deserving Woman with a good Fortune For since it is not in my Power to make you happy all that remains is with Sincerity and Truth to wish you so  I long impatiently to see you yet would by no Means have you come 'till it suits your own Convenience I have ten thousand Things to say to you  for I could find out Things to talk to thee for ever we ought to summon all the Spirit of soft Passion up to chear our Hearts thus labouring with the Pangs of parting  Pray let me know in your next when you really think of coming to Town I look on every Minute that we might and do not spend together as an irreparable Loss for oh they are but few compared to the numberless Hours we must pass asunder  Adieu my dearest  Harry  forgive my Weakness as it is you who cause it and rest assured that no Time or Chance shall ever change the unalterable Affection of  Your Eloise  LETTER CXIV  My dear  ELOISE  I THINK you have hit upon one Misfortune in Life which perhaps Philosophy may not be equal to either a Disappointment in our Loves or the intire Separation from the Person beloved But either of these did not occur to me at the Time I wrote that philosophick Letter Because I have not the least Apprehension of the first as I am well convinced of your Constancy and Truth and shall I think we are for ever parted because  rough Seas divide us and whole Oceans roll  No my bestloved I should think the whole Southern Ocean but an  Hellespont  between you and me Believe me that neither my Attachment here or your Engagement there shall separate us for any considerable Time perhaps not much longer than our separate Vocations do already of which we will talk more at Leisure soon  Another Letter of your's is just come in where you pay me a high Compliment that you would be pleased to have my Letters made publick You acknowledge some Vanity in this and you'll find upon Recollection that it was owing to the same not a different Turn of Mind  Alexander  's Quarrel with  Aristotle  In the Desire you express of making my Writings publick there is indeed a great deal of publick  Spirit and a very justifiable Vanity but neither in the Sense you mean them for if ever I appear in Print it shall be humbly Attending on you where I shall only appear like a  Dutch  Comment upon a Classick serve to explain the Sense incapable to express the Spirit I own I have often thought of some such joint Work of our's which should bear the Name of the Monument See the last Spectator of the th Volume but our Monument should be distinguished by the Title of  The Paraclete    You have no Reason to be jealous of my Attachment to rural  Pleasures  it is the Country  Business  which has detained me from you and perhaps the greatest Satisfaction I have in it is that it may soon the better enable me to see you often and for a longer Time The Pleasures alone tho' they were as high as the most Pastoral Poet ever feigned them could not withhold me a Moment from you whom I shall always consider as my charming  Rus in Urbe  in whom is joined all the Sweetness Innocence and Truth of a Country Life with all the highest Refinements of a Court  Your Argument about our Knowledge of each other in a future State has something in it not only very pretty but of rational Philosophy and sound Divinity and I will rest my Faith upon it as that charming Hope gives me  an higher Relish of the World to come than any Thing else which I have now a Notion of  Adieu  my dearest  Fanny  Your's here and hereafter  LETTER CXV  My dear  FANNY  I AM come hither in Quest of Vote and Interest but return Tomorrow  Wednesday  next I set out from  Belvidere  and  Friday  from for  London  I shall pass round thro' the County of so what Day I shall be in Town I can better let you know from some Stage on the Road  I can hardly express what an Impatience I have to return to the Country tho' I have been but two Days from it upon Business too which I like the Serving of a Friend and in a very agreeable Town too In short I find that all the Spirit of Ambition and active Life is quite extinguished in me and supplanted by the tranquil Pleasures and speculative Leisure of rural Retirement heedless how little my Sentiments or Actions shine forth before the busy World so you and I approve In this philosophick Heroism I think I exceed  Cincinnatus  and some other of the gallant Personages of Antiquity they indeed returned to the Plough but I would not leave it This Turn of Mind which I have  had for some Time has staggered my Faith with Regard to the Change occasioned in the Nature of Things on Account of original Sin Particularly that Tillage and Agriculture became then necessary to obtain the Fruits of the Earth which used to grow spontaneously before Now I am sufficiently orthodox in sound Doctrine tho' I have not a Leprosy of Faith about me and if this moral Exercise both of Body and Mind was meant as a Curse how comes it to be attended with so much rational and philosophick Pleasure If the Mind of Man was changed at the same Time so as to accommodate itself to this Employment what is become of the Curse There is such a natural Sense of these Pleasures implanted in our Souls that we are struck with it at first Sight we know not how we feel a vague Kind of Admiration we know not why and are sensible of a certain Earnestness of Affection we know not for what not unlike the first Longings of a Maid How high then must this natural Pleasure be when it becomes a rational one when we are able to contemplate the Beauties of the Creation in a philosophick Light to explore the admirable Contrivance of Providence and investigate the hidden Causes of all natural EffectsBut I am going too far and detaining myself from the Enjoyment of a Pleasure in the Contemplation of it so shall take my  Leave of it and you in order to prepare myself more speedily for the charming Possession of both which if I could enjoy together would form the highest Satisfaction I am at present capable of  Adieu  my Eloise  LETTER CXVI  Belvidere My dear  FANNY  IF you observe I generally accost you by the Stile abovementioned because it is the first that occurs to me The Noms d'Amour of  Eloise  or  Sappho  may be more according to the Rules of Gallantry But as in the latter Titles you are considered as a personated Character and in the Former a real One I chuse to address you in the familiar Phrase as I well know you have more Charms in Reality than it is in the Power of Fiction to give you In short my dear Girl according to an elegant Description in some of the Classicks in the Novel you are  formosa  but in yourself  ipsa Forma  The making Use of  Latin  Sentences to you may perhaps appear a little pedantick but there is indeed in your Understanding so little of Effeminacy that I frequently consider you not only as a Man but a Man of Letters too and I remember I once threatened that if at any Time you should say or do any Thing  rude to me I believed I should be brave enough to draw my Sword on you  Some elegant Author says that in Waiting for his Mistress all the rest of Life is but Attending 'till the comes so I confess sincerely to you that in your Absence I have no Enjoyment of myself but in this distant Intercourse between us for when I am at Leisure to retire within myself you are the only Object placed there which I find any Pleasure to converse with  I have observed since the Interregnum of our Loves a certain good Breeding in my Manners and Complacency of Address towards you which I am extremely pleased with which shews the Difference between a Triumph over our Persons and a Conquest over our Minds In a Word the Redintegration of our Affections like a mutual Triumph is to be considered more as an Alliance than a Conquest and for my own Part I confess that the Regaining of your Regard and Esteem like a Conquest over one's own Passions has such a Resignation to Sense and Virtue that it inspires me with a calm humble Pride very different from the Exultation we feel upon ordinary Triumphs  I received your Letter but could not answer it last Post as my Head Heart and Hand were taken up to serve a Relation and Friend  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CXVII  My dear  HARRY  I CONFESS that like you I am fonder of this simple Appellation than all the florid Names that ever graced Romance but like your Complaisance this Fondness bears but a late Date For I well remember a Time when I would have exchanged the most advantageous Proposal of Marriage for a Letter signed  Orondates Cyrus  or any other heroick Name I can now with great Pleasure boast a Change in my Disposition almost to a direct Contradiction of my former Sentiments and can assure you that I think it a very high Triumph for a Woman under five and Twenty to have surmounted all the Romance which could possibly be crammed into a little female Soul  Hurried as I am and plagued with Business more than ever I was in my Life I pass many Hours in silent Conversations with you and when I start from my Reveries am surprized and sorry at not finding you "close by my Side" My being immersed in Business as it confines me much at Home where I have no Companion makes all my Thoughts turn upon you and I have frequently in reading aloud applied to you for your Opinion of a Sentiment▪ Why are you not here to answer me  I begin to grow jealous of your contemplative Pleasures when I think my dearest  Harry  may indulge them when I am far removed from a Possibility of any other yet he now prefers them to a personal Converse with me  Perhaps I am too fond  but let the short Time limited for my earthly Happiness plead my Excuse  I am vastly indebted to you for your elegant Compliment tho' I am thoroughly conscious I by no Means deserve it I am pleased with that or any Thing else which gives my dear  Harry  an Opportunity of shewing his Wit and Politeness Not that I want fresh Proofs to convince me that had he a proper Object to inspire him his Writings might well vie with any the greatest Masters in the Art of Pleasing For my own Part I solemnly declare that the Addresses of the greatest Monarch on Earth could not to my Vanity afford so high a Triumph as those elegant Praises which your dear charming Letters abound with There is in my Temper something that arises either from Benevolence to the World or selfish Vanity I can't tell which that in Contradiction to  Alexander  's Opinion and your's makes me wish to communicate the Pleasure I receive from your Writings to the World for I look upon it as a high Degree of Avarice to monopolize such an invaluable Treasure  Tho' I am transported at the Thought of your considering me as a Male Friend yet I  in  something vastly tremendous in it The  great Disparity in our Understandings may now be accounted for with some Shew of Reason It is the Charter of our Sex to be Fools and the numberless Weaknesses which intitle us to your Regard and Protection create a peculiar Kind of Affection which it is natural to feel for Creatures in our Power But should we once disclaim that  powerful  Weakness which renders us alike Objects of Love and Pity we are no longer intitled to that Indulgence and Partiality which the Wisest of us want and the Simplest have a Claim to Let me therefore intreat my dearest  Harry  to look on my Friendship for him as truely Masculine But let my Understanding still claim all the Privileges of the Feminine Gender  I think we have both great Reason to triumph in our late Reconciliation as you in attempting to regain my Esteem paid the highest Compliment to my Affection for you while I proved to Demonstration that you had Merits sufficient to surmount my Pride and your own FailingsMay we long continue to receive Pleasure from the Recollection of our past Uneasinesses and to look on that as the happiest Aera of our Lives that restored us to each other  I heartily wish your Friend Success as you are interested for him but I shall be very apt to hate him bravely if he should be again the  Occasion of your missing a Post  I am my dear  Harry  constantly and sincerely  Your's  LETTER CXVIII  Dear  FANNY  I WAS as bad last Night as ever the Reason I did not appear so the Night before was that I did not sleep long enough to give my Rheum Strength sufficient to oppress me It is now near Two before I could set out and shall have but just Time to reach  Barnet  perhaps not before Night so can't call on you Today as I promised  I thank you for your Letter this Morning and am almost sorry I did not want your Favour for I have a Pleasure in being obliged to you But perhaps I shall soon and will then call on you I beg you will write me Word by  Tuesday  's Post whether you will speed the Frolick of coming down to the Country who the Party is to be and what the StageI mean the Place of Meeting Don't my dear  Fanny  have any Doubts or Qualms about my Desire to see you because I did not receive the Proposal with Transport at a Time when all my Faculties were overpowered by Disorder and Want of Rest besides you surely ought to distinguish between the Effects of Pleasure and those of Joy the Transports of the one your  Coyness has refused me but the Tranquility of the other your Conversation upon any Terms will always afford me  Consider too if I did not press you to a Fatigue and an Expence for this and the other Reasons above hinted I should not have been treated with such unkind Suspicion  Whenever your Words or Actions can bear two Meanings I always arrest the best and where they can admit but of one and that not favourable I set them by as not to be accounted for  I beg to hear from youand tell me of your Health  I am  my dearest  Fanny  Your's without Doubt    LETTER CXIX  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I RECEIVED your last Adieu and am in Reality more obliged to you than I should have been for a much kinder for by convincing me you felt no Concern from our Separaration you lessened mine extremely  I sincerely hope that the Freshness and Purity of the Country Air will in a few Days restore you to perfect Health and I make not the least Doubt but its contemplative Pleasures will quickly recover your Spirits to that calm uniform philosophick Chearfulness which the interposing Impertinence of disagreeable or  at best insipid Objects may for some Time past have ruffled  You compliment me extremely when you suppose me capable of distinguishing the Effects of Joy from those of Pleasure I have been but little conversant with either of them therefore my Ignorance is excusable should I tell you I always looked on them as twin Sisters and so very like that it was difficult to know one from t'other I think too they are the joint Offspring of Love and Reason who disputing to whom they should pay most Obedience quarrelled and have never since been reconciled  But to speak in a more natural Way I look upon Joy and Pleasure to be synonymous Terms they arise from one Faculty or Affection of the Mind and Joy is nothing more or less than the first and strongest Emotion which breaks out on our being really pleased I will not pretend to say that my Definition is right I have only given my OpinionBut this I know that if I am not capable of abstracting Joy from Pleasure I can at least distinguish Pleasure from IndifferenceFor this Reason you may justly suppose the Party at an End from the Moment it was mentioned and I here give you my Word it is the last of the Kind I shall ever propose with you I hope you will pardon what is past on this very sincere Promise of Amendment  I am far from being displeased at finding  your Prudence superior to mine It has indeed been so thro' the whole Course of our Acquaintance but as I believe there are few People who have more Quickness and Vivacity in their Dispositions so there is no Person breathing whose Spirits are more easily damped than mine for Want of Resolution has hitherto been my greatest Fault as well as MisfortuneAs I have been often led by Persuasion to many Things contrary to my Inclinations while from Want of Resolution I have left undone those Things which Reason Virtue Prudence and Pride dictatedIn both these Cases I consider myself as very blameable by acting in direct Opposition to the little Understanding that Providence has blessed me with In this Light I think my supporting any Kind of Correspondence with you an Offence against myself more unpardonable than any I ever yet had Will or Power to commit to the Prejudice of any other Creature But tho' this like all other Acts of Folly carries its Punishment in the Commission I am determined not to leave it in your Power to make that an Act of Necessity which I design a SacrificeAnd as I am not capable of affording you any Kind of Happiness without injuring myself I think it is high Time to put an End to our mutual Uneasiness and remain satisfied with the pleasing Belief that we would each do much to make the other happy  You know this Resolution has taken up my Thoughts for some Time and I solemnly declare I mention it now from no other Motive but a Design of reducing it to Practice I have not one Doubt with Regard to your Affection for me I do indeed believe you love me but I am certain  that  Love can only be productive of Misery to me and as you are and ever have been a thousand Times dearer to me than myself I can better bear a voluntary Punishment than any inflicted by you for there the Means would double the Misfortune  I thank you for your kind Construction of my Words and Actions may they ever appear to you in their native genuine Light you will then think of me  as one that loved not wisely but too well  I have not been out of Doors since I saw you nor well one Moment I had a violent Return of the Cholick about three Hours after you left me I could not rest in Bed but walked about the Room all Night by this Means I increased my Cold and have now got a very comfortable Cough I flatter myself your's has left you if so I shall bear mine with greater Patience for tho' I wish we should  both utter the same Harmony  I would not have the sympathetick Power extend to Pain or Discord  I heartily wish you the Compliments of the Season and a long and uninterrupted Succession  of healthful and happy Years  I am now and ever shall be your truly affectionate Friend and Servant    Frances  LETTER CXX  Dear  FANNY  I AM just got Home for I was so ill on the Road that I was not able to perform the Journey in the usual Time What alarms me is that I neither find myself better or worse which makes me apprehend that the Disorder is become Part of my Constitution for to borrow an Allusion from moral Things it has been observed that Persons of equal Tempers have been always found in Love or Friendship more remarkable for Constancy than those who are subject to Heats and Colds  MemorandumThis Cold I got in the Court of Chancery and I fear it will last like a Chancery Suit for Life tho' to shew you I am not splenetick about the Matter let us talk of Death and Burial a little for those who are most afraid care least to speak of them As to my Death I would chuse a sudden one contrary to a Prayer in the  Litany  for I hope nothing from a Deathbed Repentance as by the Tenor of a Man's Life he ought in Justice to be judged If I was to linger I should chuse to be in Pain as the getting Ease might better reconcile me to the Thoughts of Death  As to my Burial I do not like any of the Methods used by the Antients or Moderns The  Egyptian  Mummy which was in the highest Esteem I dislike more than all for I can't bear the Thought of lying a Moment idle either alive or dead for which Reason I prefer Burning the Body to any other Way not in the  Asbesto  Shrowd because the Parts dissipated in Smoke fall immediately to Earth again and become the first Food of Plants which immediately become the first Food of Animals so that a Man may have a Resurrection of every Part of his Body in a short Time after his Death which tho' he will not be conscious of will surely flatter his Vanity as well as the Thoughts of Fame which he is supposed to know as little of But tho' I prefer Burning for these Reasons to any other Method usually practised yet if I were to chuse for myself I would rather be devoured by Beasts as by that Means I should more immediately become Part of a living Animal and the Beasts I would name should be Dogs because their Instinct comes the nearest to human Reason of any Brute and the Dogs I would pitch upon should be three of three different Kinds a Mastiff for its Courage a Hound for its Sagacity and a Spaniel for its Fidelity  I have just received a Letter from you which may not improperly be taken Notice of here as the Thoughts of Death and Parting from you  are equally distant from me How could you write so peevishly my little cross PetI am extremely concerned to hear you are ill and beg to know how you are by the Return of the Post  LETTER CXXI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    A KIND of Superstition which I have neither Power nor Inclination to account for impels me in Contradiction to my Reason to write to you When I wrote last I resolved to write no more there is nothing in your Letter that requires an Answer yet in a Room full of Company where I have dined and supped for it is now near o'Clock I cannot resist a something like Insatuation that prompts me to tell you I am really concerned and alarmed at the Account you give me of yourself with Regard to your Mind as well as Body  Dost thou delight to make a constant Martyr of me  There is something so extremely illnatured in your endeavouring to shock me with the Mention of your Death as I should not easily forgive did not my superior Concern for your ill Health and gloomy Habit of Mind absorb all other ConsiderationsThat the Thought of Death is and should be frequent with all rational Mortals I allow but had you even common Tenderness for me it is the last Subject you would treat on it is indeed  the only melancholy Thought you have not rendered familiar to me and it is a Kind of Disgrace to me that I am not more conversant with what I have so often experiencedfor Death is Parting  This Day twelvemonth we were reconciled and now with a Heart and Eyes overflowing with the sincerest Tenderness I bid Adieu to my dear  Harry  and all those vain imaginary Schemes of Happiness which my fond Heart had formed for future Days  May every Happiness in Life attend you and if you wish to give me Ease tell me as soon as it is in your Power that you are well I neither wish nor desire that you should take more Notice of this than my former Letter excuse its Folly and Inconsistence and believe me your faithful and affectionate  Friend and Servant  LETTER CXXII  My dear  FANNY  YOU first banish me your Love and then seem concerned at the Apprehensions of my Death  Leonora  in the  Revenge  just after she has stabbed herself takes Notice of such an Inconsistency as this in  Alonzo  I shall say no more on this Head for the same Reason that as you say I took no Notice of your former Letter which is that I am resolved never to make Replication to any Paragraph of your's  which makes me uneasy lest the Altercation should grow to such a Warmth as is inconsistent with  that  which I sincerely hope may always subsist between us However I took Notice of the whole Subject of your Letter I think in the latter Part of mine and I am rejoiced to find you think in the same Way by saying in your last that "Death is Parting"  I thank you extremely for your Concern about my Health and be assured my dearest  Fanny  that this is equal to any one Reason I have to be concerned about it myself Upon my Honour if I had apprehended that Letter would have given you any Uneasiness I would not have wrote it for tho' the Unkindness of your's might have justified such a Reply yet it rendered me too lowspirited to be malicious and in general that Subject has and will whenever urged give me a great deal of unfeigned Uneasiness and Concern but must not ought not ever to raise my Resentment I spoke of Death as I hope you did of Parting without a certain or a serious Thought about it for since  Nero  's Days a Man may make his Will without the Danger of dying I am however a great deal better than I was at that Time tho' without using any Sort of Means not even as much as I did in Town and I believe if I could stay within for two Days I should be perfectly well but tho' I have no Person at Work these Holydays I can't help frequently to haunt and revisit  these dear Scenes late rendered more dear where we have sat walked and conversed together  I find my Love of Solitude increasing every Day which Inclination beside the Enjoyment of Solitude itself gives me a very flattering Pleasure for according to a rational and refined Opinion or Sentiment of your's mentioned in a late Conversation we are not only to perfect ourselves in Virtue here but also in a true Taste and Relish for the Pleasures of the Blessed if we would reach the Sublimity of those Joys which we are taught to hope for Now methinks my Aversion from Society and frequent Retiring as it were within myself in a great Measure prepares me for the Enjoyment of that intuitive Converse which Spirits or Angels hold with each other by intellectual Vision without the paltry slow and imperfect Aid of Sounds of which spiritual Act I think the Communing with our own Hearts Reflection or mental Soliloquy have a very great Resemblance  Other Lovers say they would retire from all Society for you but I would quit even Solitude for your Converse as it is a nearer Approach to those Pleasures I hinted at above and in some Sort the Enjoyment of that Heaven upon Earth But  They say bad Men would be unbless'd in Heaven  What is my Crime which makes me so with you  Oh Why am I sent a banish'd Man to roam  Adieu my Heart's dear  Fanny  I am your's in this World and the next  Henry  LETTER CXXIII  My dear  FANNY  WHEN we read a  Spectator  of  Addison  's together lately in  London  you may remember I cavi  led at his saying the Will was one of the Faculties of the Soul When I came home I looked into  Locke  's  Essay upon the human Understanding  and finding him in the same Story I began to reflect a little upon this Head and found I had apprehended that the Will was said to be one of the  special  Qualities of the Soul but the Word  Faculty  being a comprehensive Term and signifying a Power then whatever a Soul has the Power of doing is called one of its Faculties tho' not one of its essential Qualities so that in the general Sense of the Phrase neither  Addison  or  Locke  may be reprehended but as they both join  Willing  which is but a Power to  Thinking  which is a Property I apprehend they are mistaken in their Metaphysics by ranking them under the same Class And it was this Error which occurring  strongly to me at the Time I mention made me hastily conclude that if there was any Mistake in  Addison  it must be rather in his Words than his Sense  I was well pleased I had this Occasion of looking into Mr  Locke  's  Essay  which is a Book I had never read but once when I was very young because upon this same Subject he has affirmed a Thing which has provoked me extremely and if he has not been called to account for it before now it would surprize me but as I never met any Thing written on this Head I shall take the Liberty of answering him  In the first Chapter of his second Book he affirms that the Soul does not always think that Thinking is not Part of its Essence but one of its Operations  i e  Faculty or Power in the diffusive Sense This I deny for if we can suppose a Soul not to think for an Instant we can suppose it not to think for a Day a Month a Year and so for Eternity Which is contrary to the Nature of a Soul therefore impossible For wherein does a Soul consist if not in Thought and Reflection He compares Thought to Motion and says A Body tho' it sometimes moves does not necessarily move How imperfect is this Reasoning and how weak all Illustrations of spiritual Operations by referring them to sensible Acts A Body does not move of itself but either mediately or immediately by some Spirit and is therefore dependent  on Spirit for its Operations But surely Spirit is independant on Matter and selfsufficient in its own Powers and as the several Qualities Properties or Faculties of the Soul are not really distinct but only philosophically divided to give us a better or more formal Method of reasoning about them as it is the whole Soul which thinks reflects reasons  c  then should any of these Qualities or Faculties cease to operate but for an Instant what should ever call them to Action againexcept that Almighty Power which first set them to work And this would be equal to a new Creation of that or any other Spirit and to be repeated as often as it began to think reflect or reason Which as the Author of Nature acts always by the most simple Laws we are not to suppose without stronger Reasons than weak Men's mere Hypothesis In short if Thinking is not essential to a Soul what are its essential Qualities If it has no essential Qualities then it exists not at all Extension is essential to Matter when Matter ceases to have Extension it ceases to exist  Mr  Locke  speaks against the Soul's essential Thought to introduce his Reasoning against innate Ideas but as innate Ideas are one of the Proofs brought for the Being of a God I will never give them up upon any Reasoning less than Conviction He shews us indeed how we may come by most of the Ideas we have without  any previous Impression but this does not prove we have no such previous Impression for the same Truth may be conveyed to us by different Ways I grant him that the Ideas of Colours and of all sensible Objects may be acquired by Experience but if Truth Beauty Harmony or Order were not originally impressed on our Souls nothing in this World not even the Objects themselves could excite our Ideas of them All the Ideas we have in common with Brutes I will allow we may acquire as they dobut no farther  I am neither better or worse of my Cold nor more or less affectionately and sincerely your's my dear  Fanny  which I shall continue as long as my innate Ideas of Truth Beauty Harmony and Order shall exist  LETTER CXXIV  THE Pleasure I received from my dear  Harry  's last Letter like the intuitive Converse he mentions can only be imagined not expressed I care not how inconsistent you think me provided you believe that  Sorrow ne'er can touch my Mind  Whilst you are well and not unkind  Yet notwithstanding that my every Word and Action prove even against my Will the Strength of my Affection for you I cannot help earnestly desiring to put an End to the continual Anxiety which my Attachment does and  ever will produce I still think that Parting from what we love much dearer than ourselves is far more dreadful than the last sad Adieu 'twixt Soul and Body for in general the Soul is weary of its Confinement and tired out with Pain it longs to mingle with its kindred Spirits to satisfy its boundless Thirst of Knowledge to range thro' all the liquid Fields of Air to contemplate the Glories of its own Essence in the immediate Presence of that Almighty Being from whom it sprung Perhaps it longs to be again restored to the dear Converse of some muchloved and long lamented Friend On the Contrary a Person in this World who is separated from those he has loved long and well bears the worst Kind of Death a living one and may be considered in the same State as I should suppose an angelick Being if banished from his Creator's Presence compelled to take a human Form and live on Earth among the Sons of Men It is retaining a strong Idea of the Happiness he had once enjoyed must double every Distress and his Desire to be restored to the Converse he was deprived of must render all other painful to him  Let me now ask you if you suppose that any rational Being would voluntarily rush into such a Scene of Misery as I have described Yet this must be the End of all that Love that Constancy and Truth I have preserved inviolable  to youpainful Reflection this last Paragraph has sunk my Spirits so very low that I must quit the SubjectOh that my Heart could shut it out for ever  I think it is  Cowley  says  a Man must intirely be divested of all  Affections  as well as  Passion  before he can enjoy the Pleasures of Solitude For if his Mind be possessed with either he had better been in a Fair than a Wood for our Passions may like petty Thieves pick our Pockets in the Midst of Company but like Robbers they use to strip bind or murder us when they catch us alone This is but to retreat from Men and fall into the Hands of the Devil  I therefore congratulate you and should endeavour to condole myself did not your Happiness always appear of more Moment to me than my own but as I have not so entirely subdued my Passions as you seem to have done I can only pretend to assure you from the Sincerity of my Heart that I would prefer your Company to that of any Person who does or ever did exist I do not except any one of the first or last  Augustan  AgeAnd I may go farther by assuring you that if I know my own Heart I would prefer you to all of them and live in Shades with thee and Love alone or to use the Words of the Author I have already quoted  With thee for ever I in Woods could rest c  Your remembering any Sentiment of mine affords the highest Triumph both to my Love and Vanity For you and you only can raise either I don't wonder at all that you should prefer Communing with your own Heart to any other Conversation this World can afford it surely must be a Kind of Anticipation of those celestial Joys we are to suppose the Portion of the Blessed as it must continually fill your Mind with the highest Sentiments of Gratitude and Rapture to the Divine Being who has been graciously pleased to bring you so much nearer his infinite Perfection than your Fellowcreatures He has indeed my dearest  Harry  blessed you with such uncommon Talents as render it impossible for you to be negatively good and must either make you an Ornament or Disgrace to that Rank of Beings you are placed in  I thank you heartily for your very elegant Compliment but I am well convinced both from Reason and Experience that you must have less Understanding or I more before you can possibly prefer my Company to your own  I received your Essay and am excessively angry that you have left me nothing to say on the Occasion it is so like Conviction which I hate because it destroys Argument How was it possible for you to find Words to demonstrate the undoubted Truths which you have proved  For I look upon this to be the most difficult Species of Writing  Now for myself which by just Gradation I mention last I have been very ill with constant Cholicks ever since you left Town I grow worse every Day and am at last prevailed on to take an Emetick which disagreeable Operation I shall set about the Moment I have finished this abominable Scrawl I absolutely don't know what I write My Aunt has been talking to me ever since I took up the Pen I am really ashamed to let such a Collection of Blots Blunders and Tautologies go out of my Hands but if I ever had any Talent for Writing it is intirely worn out and I set about it with as much Reluctance as I do Eating when I have no Appetite merely because I know it is necessary to my supporting Life  You are not "sent a banished Man to roam" it is I alas who am the ExileI hope to hear by Tomorrow's Post that you have quite got the better of your Cold I shall always receive the utmost Pleasure from your Letters but as you may easily perceive I cannot write therefore hope you will excuse me You would pity me if you knew how I am plagued with ConversationAdieu my dear  Harry  I am as usual your sincerely affectionate  Friend and Servant  LETTER CXXV  My dear  FANNY  I AM heartily concerned at the bad Account you give me of your Health and must intreat you will act by me in that Affair as I did by you for when I found you were fondly alarmed at my Disorder I used all the Methods I could think of to get myself well against the next Post that I might ingenuously give you an Account of my Recovery which I partly feigned in my last Letter to make you easybut I shall make no Oblations to  Hygea  for the Cure if she has neglected your Health to take Care of mine  There is really something unaccountable in the Turn of Mind you seem to have been in for some Time past You say you fear we shall some Time or other part therefore desire to do it now  so run into the Danger to avoid the Apprehension  Such Caprice as this would make us banish Friends Children and every Blessing of Life from our Enjoyment because perhaps one Day or other we may be deprived of them What Reason in the World have you to apprehend any Separation in our Loves I declare upon my Honour that I am not the least sensible of any Decay in my Regard Affection Assiduity Love or Friendship for you nor am I conscious of any Engagement Scheme Policy or Ambition which should make it honourable or honest even to wish my Attachment  less to you Surely the fond Expostulation I make with you at present ought to convince you of the Sincerity and Ingenuousness of this Declaration for if my Fickleness or Caprice had given me other Sentiments toward you what a vast and lucky Relief would your present and late Behaviour be to me How readily should I then take you at your Word happy to have my Inconstancy accounted for to the World and justified even by the Person I was willing to forsake Indeed my dearest  Fanny  if ever you mention this Subject to me again there will be no Way left of accounting for it but supposing that you find something in your own Heart which may make you apprehend that my Constancy Love and Attachment to you may some Time or other be a Reproach to you  There is another Passage in your last Letter which I absolutely interdict you for the future How can you be so disingenuous as to say you cannot write For nobody who writes well can be ignorant of it nor can anybody ever write well who does not think they do I declare I never met with Writings in any Language more sensible more delicate or more correct than most of your Letters and if I do not upon every Occasion express my just Sense of them it is because I really think their Merit is above my Praise and whenever I do mention them in the Manner I do now it is more from the Vanity of shewing you my own Taste than to pay any Compliment to your's  We have had the most disingenous Weather I ever remember since I came down to the Country It promises and threatens by Turns but fulfils neither and keeps one in a State of Uncertainty both with Regard to Business or Pleasure which is very perplexing I cannot undertake any Business at home nor can I amuse myself with going abroad My Corn is growing too rank and my Sheep are dying of the red Water Write me a  Lapland  Ode my dear Muse to invite over some Frost and Snow immediately or we poor Farmers will be undone I forget whether I told you before that I have set the last Acre of since I came down which has made my Mind very easy and therefore I am pleased at mentioning it to you  I wish my dearest  Fanny  Joy of every Advantage of mine in LifeFarewel my charming Girl and believe nay be certain that I am ever your's  Henry  LETTER CXXVI  THE kind Concern my dear  Harry  expressed in his last Letter for my Health would I think render me unpardonable if I did not feel as much Pleasure in acquainting him with my Recovery as I flatter myself he will receive from the Account I am indeed much better Thanks to my Regard for you for were I not  persuaded that my Life is of Moment to your Happiness how earnestly should I wish to abandon it That Love of Life which is I believe implanted in the Heart of every Creature renders Death formidable to us while we are in perfect Health but when the animal Spirits are weakened by Pain when we only live to Misery our Sentiments are wholly changed and we wish for Death as a Relief from Torment Think then if my every Thought Hope and Wish were not centered in you how earnestly should I have desired a Deliverance from Pain But perhaps I deceive myself perhaps in Contradiction to what I have said the Voice of Nature more powerful than even that of Love made me wish to liveperhaps my Life is of no Consequence to you  I will however endeavour to banish the cruel Reason that would inform me and preserve my Illusion that I may preserve my Life  As my first Wish is to be beloved by you my second is to be approved let me then my dear  Harry  giving full Force to your Protestations account for what you unjustly call Caprice I own I love you enough to be guilty of the very Folly you charge me with imbittering the present Happiness by the Fear of losing it But it is not from this Motive that I have mentioned our Parting I know and feel that my Affection and Friendship for you increase daily therefore cannot suspect that  your's for me are lessened but whenever I dare venture to ask myself what will be the End of our mutual Attachment I tremble at the Reply my Reason makes and almost wish we hated one another For the present my Regard for you renders every Pleasure in Life insipid to me and every Accident indifferent that has not some Relation to you my whole Time and Thoughts are devoted to you and Business or Pleasure are alike hateful to me For this Indifference to the Objects that surround me I think myself amply rewarded by the Pleasure I receive from your Letters and wish for no other Recompence for all my Love and Tenderness but a Continuation of your's But tell me my dearest  Harry  what will all this end in The little Circle of my Acquaintance speak of my Attachment to you with seeming Pity from a Belief that you have none to me The World in general treat me in the severest Manner on your Account Answer me now my Heart's dear  Harry  with Truth and Justice for Reason prompts the Question and Honour will not dally longer can you indeed lay your Hand on that dear Breast where  Fanny  's Heart inhabits and tell me you have Love Honour and Constancy enough to repay all her past present and future Sufferings by seriously intending whenever it is in your Power to make her your WifeConsider well this Point for it is of the highest Moment to us both and  on your Answer intirely depends my continuing those pleasing Ideas which have hitherto supported me thro' the various Scenes of Distress I have suffered for you or by a proper Resolution erasing them and you for ever from my Heart Let not a false Delicacy to yourself or an affected Tenderness for me prevent your speaking your Sentiments with that Frankness which I think I ever merited from you and be assured your speaking candidly should it even acquaint me with the most unwelcome Truths will raise you higher in my Esteem than your attempting to amuse me with unmeaning Expressions of Regard I do not indeed suspect that you have hitherto said any Thing to me which you did not think but as the Matter in Question is of the nicest Nature I would guard against every Thing which could possibly aggravate the Misfortune I am taught to apprehend  Your Reproaching me with Want of Tenderness I can readily forgive First as my Heart is armed so strong with Truth that it repels the Dart nor suffers it to wound your Image which is lodged in its inmost Recessesnext as my so often mentioning our Parting without having Courage to assign the Cause might well warrant your seeming Suspicion of my Affection tho' I dare venture to affirm you never yet injured me so far as in Reality to doubt it  Let me now my dear and bestloved  Harry  conjure you by all the Love and Tenderness you ever vowed to me to rest assured that the Words which I have wrote on the melancholy Subject of our Parting have been so many Daggers to my Heart and that no light Suspicion of your Love or idle Caprice of my own has occasioned my reducing you to an Explanation which I would part with a Limb to avoid for tho' I cannot will not doubt your Love I tremble at the TrialNo my own Heart bears Witness to your Truth it is filled with you and you alone why then should I not in Contradiction to the World believe this faithful EvidenceAlas I fear it is too much your Friend  Deliver me I intreat you my Heart's dear  Harry  from the painful Situation I am in Raise me at once to a higher Sense of Happiness than I have yet known or plunge me into such a State of Misery as can only be relieved by the sad Cure of all our Ills  I thank you for your Account of You may indeed congratulate me on every Circumstance which gives you Pleasure assured of this that I receive a double Joy by Reflection and were we this Moment forever separated your Happiness and Interests would still continue far dearer to me than my own  You have commanded me not to apologize for my Writing I obey tho' conscious  that as all my Letters are wrote from the Heart they have nothing to attone for their Folly but their Sincerity which will ever impel me thro' every Season Change and Chance of Life to subscribe myself  Your's and only Your's  LETTER CXXVII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I AM but just able to tell my dear  Harry  that I have great Hopes of my Recovery because it is hardly possible I should be worse My Disorder is of an intermittent Nature and generally makes its Attacks like a Thief in the Night I was so violently ill as to be obliged to have my Apothecary called out of Bed at o'Clock this Morning Poor  Kitty  has a miserable Time of it for her Rest is as much broken as mine During my Intervals of Pain which are very short I find myself oppressed with a stupid Kind of Langour not unlike a Lethargy Can you believe that even bodily Pain could reduce me to such a State I am more alarmed at this than any other Part of my Disorder as it is intirely contrary to my natural Constitution but perhaps it is only the Effect of Pain that wearies out my Spirits and leaves this hateful Lassitude upon them I am this Moment obliged to leave off it is impossible to tell you what I suffer I am amazed at  my own Strength as I have sometimes been at that Constancy which makes me sick or well living or dying your's  I am again relieved from extreme Pain This last Fit has been much shorter than the former ones which is I hope a good Symptom but still so weak and trembling that I can scarce hold the Pen Why are not you here to pet me They have ordered something to make me sleep I will take that or any Thing else that they tell me will do me Good because you desire it  As soon as I am able I will answer your last Letter in the mean Time let me know you wish my Health as earnestly as I do your's and that shall avail me more than ten Physicians  LETTER CXXVIII  My dearest sick Pet  I AM just come home from a Week's Business and received your Letter which by my Absence has lain a Post unanswered and which indeed I should answer with the  ipse veni  as I shall do at present for while I am writing I am ordering fresh Horses to be saddled and it shall be their Fault if I don't outride the Post And dost thou wish me there to comfort you I will be there my wellloved Heart with all the Softness Tenderness with all the Woman in my Soul to ease thy throbing Breast and languid Head Nay with more  unfeigned Sollicitude than Woman ever could feel for the vainest Woman must be envious of you Your melancholy Account of yourself has made me recollect that Line in  Tickell  which we could not think of the last Time we were together and speaking of that pretty Poem  Sad Luxury to vulgar Minds unknown  Which Passage also occurred to me when I wrote to you on the Subject of melancholy Pleasures tho' I did not quote it  I hope my cross Pet that it is owing to the Peevishness of Sickness your saying you are surprized at your Constancy toward me Any Fickleness in that Point must be charged upon yourself for without Vanity I may say that it is impossible I can ever be less amiable than I was at first If from thenceforward I became capable of Sense Science or Philosophy I owe the Inspiration to you and you alone my  Iphigenia  When the Sun withdraws his Beams is it a Reflection upon our Horizon that it shines no more But like that tho' I love the Light I shall retain the Warmth 'till I am Earth indeed You have really my charming Woman not only given me a Relish for Life but a true Taste for every Thing in it which is worth living for And as you have given me Happiness I look upon it on some Occasions as an ungenerous Act to interrupt or endeavour to destroy that Bliss 'till I consider you in  the Light of a Woman who has brought a great Fortune to a Beggar and has consequently a natural Right to squander what Part she pleases From you my charming Muse I have learned particularly three Things more valuable than all the Science of the  Sorbonne  Chearfulness without Mirth Gravity without Spleen and oh take it for your Pains Love with Esteem the warmest Love with the highest Esteem  Farewel Farewel indeed I shall conclude your's in Haste to fly to you  Henry  LETTER CXXIX  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I Have spent my Time very ill since I saw you I have been reading a Collection of Letters from  Swift Pope Gay Bolingbroke c  which have spoiled my Relish for Writing by giving me too good a Taste for it However this Humility of mine cannot defend me from being a punctual Correspondent since I have had the Assurance to answer your Letters constantly and as  Hudibras  says  What is Worth in any Thing  But so much Money as 'twill bring  I may presume that my Letters are of inestimable Value while they purchase your's  I am now more entertained with the private Letters of eminent Men than I am with their  more public Writings because in the former Case I fancy I am conversing with them but in the latter I only hear of them for which Reason too I am fonder of Biography than of History  I must tell you a Circumstance of my Weakness that I dropt a Tear upon reading the Account of  Gay  's Death in these Letters tho' I knew he had been dead above twenty Years  LETTER CXXX  My dear  FANNY  THE Irksomeness of our Separation needs not the Addition of your Repinings It is said that all Unhappiness is lessened by Participation but your Complaints double mine My Philosophy is prepared for any Misfortune which falls on me alone but I feel its natural Weight tenfold when rebounded from you  Your Apprehension that Absence may in Time create Indifference may be true of human Nature in general but I think my Mind is particularly framed for all the Effect I am sensible of is what Slaves feel when they attempt to part For Distance in Love but stretches the Chain to make me perceive the Alliance more strongly  You can be in no Danger from my Inconstancy if what a  French  Wit has said be true that  Absence to Lovers like Wind to the Fire extinguishes a small Flame but increases a great one  However to shew you I do not mean as  Shakespear  has beautifully expressed it  to patch up Grief with Proverbs  I shall be in Town on the th of next Month and believe me that nothing but the Exigency of my Affairs prevents me that Pleasure sooner  Henry  LETTER CXXXI  My dear  HARRY  I Reached this Place without stopping which is above Half my Journey  After Dinner I finished  Montaigne  's long  Essay on Raymond de Sebonde  or rather intitled his  Apology for Raymond de Sebonde  for a very little Portion of it relates to that Author As you design soon to read it I shall give you some Criticisms by the Way which as they can be no Way necessary for you I do only to shew you that I read not for my own Improvement alone but for your Amusement  About the Beginning of the Essay he says speaking of the new Doctrines of  Luther  that by staggering our Belief they were likely to run us into Atheism See the whole Passage at large Now this Argument is bad by proving too much for it is equally strong to support all Religions nay the Errors too of all Religion But the Christian Religion is the only true one Shall we not prune away the Errors and Mistakes which the Frailty of Man has ingrafted  on it for Fear of hurting the Root Must Truth then avail itself of Falshood and must the Imperfections of Man be sanctified by the Perfection of God Let a Man be first convinced of the Truth and Reason of any Doctrine and then let him boldly speak out even in Religion itself nay more freely there for Truth cannot contradict Truth and Religion is our greatest Concern here as it must necessarily be our greatest Concern hereafter The Christian Religion is indeed founded and very properly so upon Faith and the strongest Reasons next to Demonstration for the Belief But all its Doctrines are and ought to be founded on Reasontherefore subject to Disquisition I am extremely provoked at those who justify the Superstitions and Impositions of the Priests under the plausible Title of pious Frauds which with more Justice I stile impious Falshoods Must Truth then avail itself of Error  c  For I think it Blasphemy to affirm any Thing under the Sanction of Religion which is not of divine Authority either from Reason which is the Deity within or Revelation its Manifestation without If  Montaigne  's Reasoning is just it was so from the Beginning and must consequently have overlaid the Christian Religion in its Birth His whole Argument upon this Passage might be shewn to be extremely weak but that I should think it a Weakness to confute him However it is not owing to any  Want of Sense or Judgment in the Author but to a certain Laziness in his Disposition which did not suffer him to examine closely his own Opinions but after the Manner of an old Man of which all his Writings are full found it easier to talk than think  After his wild Manner he hops away and flies into an Essay about the Rationality of Brutes If the Schoolmen will not allow me this Expression by tying me down to a certain Definition I shall only answer them by quoting a Criticism of  Addison  's upon  Pope  's  Eclogues  that if they are not Pastorals they are something better I think he has offered a great many very bold and clever Arguments on this Subject which tho' they do not prove the Matter do at least put it out of the Power of those who deny it to prove the Contrary His whole Design thro' the Essay is by shewing the Insufficiency of human Understanding to recommend to us our Dependence upon Faith and tho' there are few People who are more inclined to a free and canvassed Disquisition of all Matters even the most sacred and most general received Opinions than I have always been yet the Arguments of  Montaigne  deduced from the Writings of the wisest of the antient and modern Philosophers have indeed put me out of Conceit with the vain Imaginations and presumptuous Reasonings of human Understanding  It was said by some Writer that the Being of a God was so far from a Matter of Doubt that it was the only Thing of which we could be certain The Essay we are upon furnishes sufficient Arguments to prove how doubtful our Knowledge is in every Thing else which resolves all Science into Faith The highest Philosophy cannot give us Certainty on the most trifling Subjects if therefore we know any Thing certainly it must be from supernatural Aid  The whole Essay would be properly classed by being bound up with the  Moriae Encomium  of  Erasmus  only with this Difference that  Montaigne  is in earnest and  Erasmus  is in jest But I like my Author best because his is a philosophical Essay the other only an humorous Satire  Adeiu  LETTER CXXXII  Dear  FANNY  I CAME hither in spight of very opposing Weather Along the Road I perceived Marks of the violent Storm and I found the great Sign and Half of the Stables of this Inn carried away by it I beg the first Account you hear of the Yacht you will let me hear it  I amused myself on the Way with reflecting upon every Person Circumstance and Thing  which I parted from at But the only Occasion I had to philosophize was on little  Jenny  for from playing with the Child I took a Hint to examine into an Opinion which the World seems possessed with and perhaps receive it upon Trust from one another as they do a great many others without inquiring philosophically into the Matter  I remember Mr a Man of tender Affections but withal a Person of excellent Understanding playing one Day with a pretty Child of his own said that he was ever since it was born waiting for and attending to that Impulse or Instinct which is called natural Affection but that all he could perceive was that he loved it more and more from Use as he had done other Peoples Children before  In short when does this particular Attachment seize us If it is natural we should perceive it the Instant we heard the first Cry but at that Time we know nothing of the Matter If we are sensible of it some Time after it is merely owing to that Habit which Mr mentioned to that  Proteus  of Nature Custom which has misled most of those Philosophers who have read Men and Manners without having studied human Naturewhich is pretending to Physics without having learned Anatomy  But even the Instant the Child is born would not the Parent rather your's should die than his So he would your Horse The Love of Property  is natural but this is Part of a general Partiality not an Instance of a particular Attachment Men get their Pictures drawn bequeath Fortunes to Strangers nay raise Obelisks to bear their Names but this is natural Vanity not natural Affection  If either Parent was affected with this Impulse let us naturally suspect the Mother most as the Child is more immediately Part of herself her Affections softer and her Understanding weaker and yet how little does Providence seem inclined to trust to this natural Instinct by furnishing her with proper Nourishment for the Child and making it turn to Pain and Distemper if not that Way applied or otherwise carried off by Methods of like Operation  Adeiu  LETTER CXXXIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    Thursday  Evening    I HAD a fine Day hither and am now stretching my Limbs before a good Fire drinking your Health and all your Healths I find there is no Place I enjoy myself so much in as an Inn I am there so intirely my own Master so detached from the World and disengaged both from Business or the vain Pursuit of Pleasure that I feel a certain contemplative Calmness in my Mind which gives me a higher Satisfaction  than any of the active Spheres of Life can do However I must interrupt this Soliloquy to go and take Care of poor  George  who fell with his Horse within a Mile of this Town and is much bruised he had a very narrow Escape of his Life  My sincere Regards to  Kitty  I am my dearest  Fanny    Your's as before  LETTER CXXXIV  Dear  FANNY  I HAD the Satisfaction when I came home of finding every Thing here safe from the Storm tho' the whole Country round me has suffered infinite Damage of Housetops Ricks of Hay and Stacks of Corn carried off and Trees torn up by the Rootswhile I have forfeited but a few Slates and some of the Branches of my Elms dishevelled There is one Piece of Damage I just heard of which will give you some Concern that above of the fine Trees in  WindsorForest  are snapped short to the Stumps  As I have no Letter from you to answer and have not been long enough in the Country to meet with any entertaining Circumstances to send you the only Amusement I can give you is from what I read and as I am in  Montaigne  which is also your Study at present I shall occasionally  give you Hints of what I find remarkable in that vague diffuse witty and sensible Author  In his Chapter stiled  Pedantry  I was pleased to find him speak a great deal upon a Subject you may remember I am very fond of which is the Distinction between Learning and Wisdom What I have to say on that Head you have heard what he says upon it I refer you to and shall only quote one Passage because it is whimsical and somewhat in your Manner  He one Day was at a Loss for accounting how several Men of the greatest Learning among his Acquaintance were very silly weak Persons Upon which a lively Woman in Company said  That in order to make Room for other Men's Sense their own must be squeezed up into so narrow a Compass as will not leave it a Power of exerting itself  To which I shall only add this Remark of my own by Way of Illustration That the Understanding like a Nation should always depend upon its own proper Force for Auxiliaries too often make Slaves of those they were called upon to assist In short it is owing to this servile Obedience and blind Deference we pay to the Antients joined to an indolent Despair of excelling such great Patterns which has almost put a Period to the Advancement of Science or Wisdom so that all the Knowledge of the Moderns is but the Learning of the Antients Insomuch that  if you propose a Subject in natural or moral Philosophy to be discussed by any of the present Adepts in Art or Science instead of pressing forward into a Disquisition of the yet inexhausted Fund of human Reason they will poorly recur to what  Archimedes Plato  or  Seneca  said upon such Matters Here take a Quotation by way of Parody  Men should press forward in Truth's glorious Chace  They who look backward surely lose the Race  It has been Matter of Astonishment to these latter Ages of the World how the great Genii of Antiquity at Times when Learning and Science were in their Infancy in general nay some of them arose in Nations confessedly barbarous could shine forth with such amazing Lustre which far from attributing to their own natural Force they have poorly called in the Aid of Inspiration to account for What a mean and stupid Exposition is this of such extraordinary Phaenomena when the true Reasons lie hid in the very Causes of their Admiration The Mind of Man naturally active and inquisitous after Truth not finding wherewithal to satisfy its unbounded Curiosity in the Darkness and Ignorance of the early Ages of the World retired within itself and attending closely to the Ideas in its own Bosom from whence in Truth all human Science and Wisdom  is extracted did from such unbiassed Contemplation arrive to a higher Pitch in the Age of a Man than an Academy is able to attain to in a Century They were certainly guilty of some gross Errors in Theory and a manifest Neglect or Want of Method in their Reasonings which has been the sole Imployment of Posterity to correct the one and new model the other nay some of the best Critics have been so infatuated with their Beauties especially with Regard to Poetry that they have made Rules of their very Faults for the Moderns to err by In short my Opinion of human Learning is that it has made the Mind of Man like an overgrown Child which by being trammelled too long in Leadingstrings and paced up and down thro' the regular Alleys of a Parterre is deprived of that Strength and Activity which a free and unbounded Exercise thro' the Fields of Nature might make it capable of arriving at And here I must remind you of my Scheme of a College mentioned to you some Time ago For if a Set of Students could possibly be improved in the Contemplation of Truth and Nature without the least Biass or Tincture of modern Knowledge or Learning it is impossible to say to what a Height the Mind of Man is capable of attaining  I am  my dearest  Fanny  your sincere Automathes  Send me the Poem you promised me by the Return of the Post  LETTER CXXXV  Dear  HARRY  I SAID I would write by this Post and in order to fulfil my Promise have taken up the Pen but find that it is not in my Power to write any thing but Words for my Thoughts are so much dissipated by the continual Hurry I have been in since I saw you that it would require at least a Week's Solitude to reduce them to any Kind of Form unless I were to send you a little Journal and by that Means treat only of the Subject I dislike most I know no other that I could think of while I wrote three Words  Love  and  you  exceptedBut you indeed are one at least in my Idea And tho' that is a Theme to which my Thoughts for ever could attend yet as they are not capable of Change and have already spoke all the dear inspiring Subject could suggest I need not refer to your Memory for all the Sentiments of my Heart past present and to come  As I never was happy enough to be able to give my Opinion from Experience on the Subject of parental Affection I shall not venture to give it at all for more Reasons than one as it unfortunately differs from your's  To my great Surprize the Postman has this Instant brought me your's from  Belvidere  Had it been a Letter on which my Happiness depended  it would have met the same Delay I am so heartily provoked I could almost swear  I am sincerely glad to hear that your dear  Belvidere  and dearer Self have not received any Injury from the fierce Rage of  Boreas  We have dismal Accounts from most Parts of the Kingdom No certain Tidings of the Yatcht it is in general believed safe tho' not supposed to have escaped the Storm I am very sorry for the  Depopulation  of  WindsorForest  I think I may be allowed the Expression as supposing an Hamadryad the Inhabitant of each Tree I think the Subject would admit of a very pretty Pastoral Elegy  I thank you for your very elegant Dissertation on Learning I have the Honour to be so much of your's and  Montaigne  's Opinion that it is impossible for me to say any Thing on the Subject You must excuse my not sending the little Poem you desired this Post but to make you Amends I send you a much better Thing inclosed  I beg to hear from you continually and am  Your own Frances  LETTER CXXXVI  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED the Song of  Palma  's and do not think there is any Thing in the Tune any more than the Words so far they are adapted  to each other It would be an easy Task to improve the Thought in a Stanza more but then it would not serve for the same Tune for the whole Address of the Composer was to suit proper Musick to the Words "Laugh" and"Cry" therefore unless the same Words were repeated in the next Verse the Sound to use a bold Expression would be errant Nonsense  My Sentiments about natural Affection do not proceed you believe me from a  Stoical  Philosophy or the Want of an humane Disposition perhaps few People feel more of Tenderness in their Hearts than I do and from a certain Softness in my Nature tho' I have not the Appearance of it in my Manners I often experience a fond Temper for other People's Children which sometimes their Parents are insensible of Therefore the Arguments I amused the Time with in the Letter you mention proceeded merely from a certain Method I have always put in Practice ever since I ventured to think for myself which was never to take any Opinion or Dogma upon the common received Notions of the World or the  ipse dixit  of the Schools without first making it pass thro' the Scrutiny of Sense and Reason which is the surest Way of allowing the full Value to every Virtue or Quality in human Nature  Besides I am jealous for the Honour or Dignity of Man and would endeavour to rescue  every Thing from Instinct which can be attributed to Reflection or universal Benevolence I think too that the Doctrine of natural Affection has often had several very bad Consequences attending it in making many Children depending on that Prejudice behave themselves more unworthily toward their Parents than they would venture to do to their Patrons and many Fathers have left immense Fortunes to graceless Sons from this Mistake while they have left an honest Servant or valuable Friend unrewarded  I expected a good deal from you upon the Subject of my late Letters or what was better something relating to yourself but your Apologies put me in Mind of what was said by a surly Courtier to King  William  that King  Charles  refused a Favour with a better Grace than he granted one  I have often in Conversation in reading to you and by Letter endeavoured to lead you into Subjects of some Intricacy or Depth in order to make you experience your own Genius and be sensible of your Strength and tho' you are sometimes too cowardly to engage yet your slight Touches and irregular Essays are like the Tuning of an Instrument by a masterly Hand which has something more pleasing to a good Ear than the irregular Performance of a middling one  Like  Shakespear  Fancy's sweetest Child  Warbling his native Woodnotes wild  LETTER CXXXVII  Dear  HARRY  I AM sorry the Song did not please you but as I have not the Misfortune to be a Connoisseur I like it mightily I am not overburthened with Knowledge of any Kind and yet I sincerely wish I had less as the little I have serves more to improve my Folly than Reason by giving me a general Disrelish to most Things that I understand For Instancelet the Words and Musick of a Song be like that I sent you equally bad and I shall be disgusted with the Words and pleased with the Tune when perhaps if I understood Musick even as well as I do Poetry I should not have received any Pleasure from either Query could my understanding Crotchets and Quavers make me Amends for robbing me of Half an Hour's Entertainment  Your Sentiments on natural Affection may for aught I know be perfectly right but I think it is vastly more to the Honour of human Nature to suppose that our Virtues are innate which is but another Name for Instinct than acquired and it is to me quite certain that this particularly must proceed from honest Instinct for the very utmost Effect which can  arise from Reflection in this Case is not to make us feel but act as if we felt the natural Touch  I am quite sensible of my own Incapacity to engage on any Topick with you and if ever I venture to give my Opinion on Subjects that I neither am nor ever shall be Mistress of it must be owing to a strong Reliance on your Indulgence and to the Pleasure I always took in having you for a Preceptor There is a Kind of Pride in receiving Instruction from the Man I love which compensates for the Mortification of being ignorant For these Reasons I think your Sarcasm rather severe than just For were I even a greater Fool than I am it would be cruel to condemn me for being so while I make no Claim to Sense or Knowledge but you are welcome to say what you please nor am I angry at your being witty There is yet another Reason which I may offer in Defence of my Cowardice and is perhaps the most valid of anythe continual Hurry I have been in ever since you left Town While you was here I neither saw nor went to see any Creature of Course had not only many Visits but Apologies to make and these joined to more Business than ever I was engaged in with a thousand perplexing Circumstances have left me hardly Time to eat or sleep I have fretted myself to Death perhaps for Want of that Philosophy  and calm Composure which you have so happily acquired  I am this Moment going to dine with Lady I have spent much of my Time with her since I saw you she is indeed a true practical Philosopher her Life and Manners furnish as a noble Lesson as any to be found in the Volumes of  Socrates  or  Plato  yet not even her prevailing Example nor all the little Arguments which my distracted Thoughts can muster have been able to reduce my Mind even to its wonted Calm But I flatter myself that a few Days by putting an End to some Part of my Anxiety will abate my Uneasiness and for the rest Time and Time only must be my Physician  I again earnestly intreat that you write to me much and often You cannot conceive the Pleasure I receive from your Letters nor the Mortification your missing a Post gives me Adieu my Heart's dear  Harry  I am and ever shall be sincerely and affectionately  Your's  P S  You have got a very sprightly Correspondent if one may judge of her Letter by her Countenance for she fits by me writing and smiling without Ceasing  LETTER CXXXVIII  My dearest  FANNY  I CANNOT give up to you the Point about natural Affection tho' you have disputed it closely with me You say Reflection cannot make us feel tho' it may make us act as if we did which is extremely just therefore I did not make Reflection the Cause of this Feeling but Habit See my first Letter which I said steals so imperceptibly upon us that we mistake it for Nature and it is so near it that it is called a second Nature  I cannot think with you that the substituting innate Ideas instead of Reason and Reflection would be more for the Honour of human Nature tho' perhaps it would be for the Dignity of it as a Work made perfect is more valuable than a Work to be perfected The Dignity lying in the simple Nature of a Thing but the Honour in the Perfection of it And surely  Socrates  reformed from Vice or Passion by the Force of Philosophy is a nobler Subject for the Honour of Mankind than  Diogenes  who was said never to have been addicted or inclined to any Humour except that of railing It was from this Way of thinking that I said something to you in my last Letter which I am afraid has given you some Offence I considered you as a Work capable of Perfection in order to rouze you to exert yourself I said I  often tempted you to try your Strength or found your Depth Was this Sarcasm to allow you both Strength and Depth In short let this Reflection always prevent any Mistake of this Kind for the Future that I love you so sincerely and like you so extremely that I can never think or mean any Thing which might give you offence And whenever I say or do any Thing which you feel yourself picqued at you may reprehend my Manners which are I confess liable to Censure But blame not my Sentiments which are faultless with Regard to you  I did attribute your not Writing to the Hurry of Business and would have wrote to you last Post but for Fear of pressing you too much at this Time as the Fatigue of writing every Post must be too much for you unless you had more retired Leisure therefore I will not be so exact with you for the Future I will write to you every Post and if you answer two three or four of my Letters at once I shall be satisfied being well convinced that you will not neglect it on Account of any Employment more pleasant but from Business more necessary This is what I have refused you ever since we were Correspondents but have thought at last that taking off the Constraint of a regular Correspondence would give a freer Air and brisker Spirit to it The first savoured of Duty this of Love  I am▪ my dearest  Fanny  Your's only  LETTER CXXXIX  MY dear  Harry  's promised Indulgence shall not make me less sollicitous to express the Pleasure I receive from his charming Correspondence than if imagined that my Thanks were the Purchase of that Pleasure I confess that from the first I have been incapable of making any other Return and now find myself if possible less capable than ever for as the Value of your Letters increases every Day or at least my Esteem for them conscious as I am of their Worth it would appear a high Proof of Confidence in me to attempt any Thing more than bare Acknowledgments Accept then my dearest Love of the warmest Gratitude which that Heart you first taught to feel and that Understanding you alone have fashioned is capable of bestowing and let my Sensibility of  your  Merit excuse the Want of it in  me    I have not since you left Town had Leisure to read a Page in  Montaigne  or any other Author I have indeed passed thro' such a Series of Hurry Disquiet and Fatigue that I am more than half dead it is not to be told how much I am changed by it but I flatter myself that the Pleasure of seeing you and the Hopes I have of enjoying Peace and Content in the Country will restore me to myself or something better  I am still in the same disagreeable Way with Regard to my Healthperhaps I am vapourish and fancy myself worse than I really am  I saw this Day he says your Cough still continuesfor Heaven's Sake how can you be so excessively illnatured as not to take some Care of yourself You must on this Occasion give me Leave to remind you of that noblest Part of  Seneca  's Philosophy which your favourite Author mentions  He that loves not his Wife or Friend so well as to prolong his Health for them but will obstinately die is too delicate and effeminate the Soul must impose this on itself when the Utility of our Friends does so require it it is a Testimony of Grandeur and Courage to preserve one's Life for the Consideration of another when a Man perceives that this Office is pleasing agreeable or useful to some Person by whom we are tenderly beloved  Taking this for granted what Judgment am I to form of your Affection for me who have so earnestly sollicited you to apply the proper Means for surmounting that nasty obstinate illnatured Cough If it were only from a Desire of conquering any Thing so perverse I would get the better of it I hope this Consideration will have more Weight than any other I have been able to offer for alas  my Advocation is not now in Tune  The Pain in my Chest is so extreme that I am not able to stoop longer  Adieu then my dearest  Harry  I am as I shall never cease to be faithfully and affectionately Your's Frances  LETTER CXL  Dear  FANNY  I Received your  Laconic  Epistle which I could wish had been still shorter as far as it mentions your being out of Order I am myself a  ittle unwell from drinking these three Days past and it must be a very irksome Reflection not to be able to recollect any one Enjoyment of which my present Pain was the Purchase for Drinking in general you know I hate and yet I would rather have drank alone than in the Company I debauched with Do not think me conceited in this Speech for I really look upon it rather as an Imperfection than a Refinement that so few People are agreeable to my Taste as it is the Sign of a depraved Appetite not to be able to relish plain and simple Meats The Men of half or quarter Understandings disgust me most and mere Fools I can live tolerably well with provided they be goodhumoured tho' a goodhumoured Fool may be compared to a fine Day in Winter which keeps us all the While in Pain with the Fear of losing it as it has not a Season to support it It is Sense alone which can give Constancy to Chearfulness or Virtue  My Disrelish to Company is a good deal owing to a certain splenetic Cast of Mind which I have contracted from some Mortifications and Disappointments I have formerly met with  joined to some Uneasinesses I at present labour under which evil Habit as I am well aware of I shall endeavour to get the better of as fast as possible For should I suffer such a Humour as this to grow upon me it might render me incapable of enjoying the Favours which perhaps Fortune has in Store for me and would be as absurd as unmanning one's self upon being crossed in Love  You have my charming Girl a good deal to answer for with Regard to my Disrelish of Conversation in general and are likely to increase the Evil every Day For your Taste and Understanding improves constantly or to speak more properly is more illustrated For I believe that in Proportion as my Sense improves or Taste refines I may be said rather to discover new Beauties than you to acquire them Here I shall observe to you what you have sometimes upbraided me with that I did not seem to increase in my Love for you from the first Time I declared my Regards Which Observation is true enough for my Love was perfect at first as I esteemed and valued you not only for what you then were but by a Praesentiment for what you would be Like a skilful Lapidary I valued the Jewel in the Stone thinking the Polishing could add but an inconsiderable Value to intrinsic Worth  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CXLI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I DO not believe there are any Words that can possibly describe the Situation of my Mind I think I want but a small Matter to render me as incapable of feeling as I am of expressing it but as I  even in Madness love thee  my Heart received a momentary Calm from your dear Letter and  for a While forgot the Approach of  Caesar    You doubtless expect that I should assign some Reason for the extraordinary Emotion I have mentioned but it arises from such a Multiplicity of odd Circumstances that it would be impossible for me even to recollect the thousandth Part of them In short my Memory tho' contrary to your Opinion accompanied what little Understanding I had and they are both marched off together Whoever finds may take them for their Pains I should be ashamed to claim them There is no body doubts the Mind's Suffering with the Body and I positively affirm that the Body returns the Compliment for I am at this Instant so extremely ill and tremble so violently that I can hardly hold the Pen And it is more than probable I should have enjoyed a moderate Share of Health if my Mind had not been hurt and harrassed  Any Person of Sense or Taste who has ever had the Happiness of conversing with you can  easily account for your general Dislike to what is called Conversation and what is still worse you are the Cause of this Disrelish in others For my Part I have often lamented on this Account that we were ever acquainted for as by a fatal Necessity we are obliged to pass so much of our Time asunder the little we spend together hardly compensates for passing the greatest Part of my Life in a strong Contempt or at best insipid tasteless Apathy to every Thing I hear or seeAs we are on this Topic I will venture to say what to anybody else who did not know me very well would appear vastly impertinent and vainthat I have often in the Company of Fools been ashamed to give any Proofs of the little Understanding which Providence has blest me with and have left a Party of Idiots thoroughly satisfied that I was by many Degrees sillier than any of the Sett  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CXLII  My dear  HELOISE  THAT I have shewn you any Beauties in your Poem which you observed not before is owing to the Eye not seeing itself but by Reflection and like a Mirrour have barely reported the Form not capable of improving it  But I have this Advantage in the Simile that the Substance of your dear Image shall always remain with me tho' the Shadow of it should be vanished  As learned Commentators view  More Things in  Homer  that e'er  Homer  knew  So it is the Character of all Persons of Genius to say Things the Beauties of which they were not aware of For as all Truth Harmony and Order are but the Expressions of the innate Ideas of a perfect Mind it is natural for the human Soul exerted to its proper Force to hint unconscious at Science or Philosophy which it had never learned or thought of The utmost of my Art can but explain your Wit or Sense not improve them and as indeed you have more of both than it is possible your Youth and Inexperience should have Skill enough to find out it shall be henceforth my pleasing Task to make that  Mine  current which shines by Use and like other Treasures increases by Communication  I do not recollect what Lines of mine you hint at if you mention them more particularly I shall send them to shew my Obedience even after your's  I am still in the same Study of  Montaigne  and have begun him again in the old Edition I had formerly by me as perhaps that may give me Light into some Passages which are very obscurely  translated in the new one and the Press of this is also the most imperfect I ever saw of any Book The Errors which the Sense can set you right in are not material but there are some very unlucky ones which lead you quite astray from the Subject as particularly  unite  for  untye c c  which I mention to put you on your Guard as you go thro' it  I declare I never received more Pleasure or Satisfaction from any Author in my Life than this He has a thorough Knowledge of the World and human Nature and more Wit than all the Epigrams which were ever wrote and many poetical Flights which the best Verse I ever read might be proud to own He has a Sense which I am fond of more improved by Thought and Reflection than Study or Learning an Understanding free from Prejudice and a Judgment formed from a natural Discernment and not framed upon the Doctrines or Opinions of others  His Sentiments are everywhere just and noble and there is a certain Freedom in his Stile and Boldness in his Expression which are strong enough to break even thro' both his Translators As for what I have heard some small Critics cavil at that he is always talking of himself is it improper to speak about what he professedly makes his Subject He treats of human Nature in general then himself ought to be his particular Study What he says of others he  can only guess at but what he says of himself he may be sure of He speaks often too grossly it is said and it is certain he doesbut then the Freedom of his Descriptions and Expressions in those Passages are only shocking to those to whom the Study of Anatomy would be obscene In short I highly esteem his Writings and greatly honour his Memory  In his short Essay upon monstrous Births which I read over this Morning he makes a very fine Observation which has amused me greatlythat perhaps what we look upon as Monsters may not be really so in the Eye of Providence for nothing can be contrary to Nature unless we mistake Custom as I have said before is often done for Nature and these heteroclite Creatures may perhaps have Relation to a Species of the same Kind unknown to Man I am particularly pleased with his philosophick Turn of Thought as it takes off greatly from the Offence which such obscene Sights naturallyI mean usually give us This Sentiment I shall extend farther with relation to those extraordinary Spirits in Virtue or Science who seem to excel Mankind as if they were of a higher Species and may perhaps have Relation to a nobler Rank of Beings but sent down a Class or more lower for some Offence in their former State and obliged to earn their Way up again to their lost Dignity according to a Discipline I somewhere read of  and was pleased with in an Army where the greatest Officer upon any Error or Breach of his Duty was degraded to some inferior Station according to his Fault and so reduced to fight his Way back again to his forfeited Rank Or perhaps these rare Genii are now and then dropped among us to raise our Emulation in Virtue or Knowledge or it may be to hint to us Mortals that the ordinary Race of Man is not the greatest Work of God which however a very little Reflection upon Providence might convince us of for God as it has been elsewhere observed allpowerful may not rest at a Creature so imperfect as Man  Farewel  my dear  Heloise  and believe me Your faithful  Abelard  LETTER CXLIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THE Story I hinted to you in a late Letter was in great Measure the Cause of the excessive Lowness of Spirits you chide me for I am mortified at the Insincerity and Ingratitude of some People on whom I had a strong Dependence particularly Lady her vehement Professions and contemptible Behaviour have served to illustrate my real Opinion that Sense and Virtue are the only solid Foundation for Love and Friendship I am absolutely amazed and angry at myself for being duped by such a Woman  But in order to set her Behaviour in a much stronger Light I have in my Acquaintance with Lady  O  found such a Contrast as is not to be described Instead of an Affectation of Sense and Virtue in the one the Actions of the other speak the full Force of both Dignity without Pride good Humour without Folly Wit without Satire Charity without Ostentation and Philosophy with the extremest Quickness of Understanding and Tenderness of Heart are all joined in the amiable Composition of that unaffectedly good Woman  Just as I had finished the last Line her Chair came for me I have been with her three Hours and would not have quitted her now for any other Pleasure but that of returning to my dear  Harry    She has indeed calmed my Mind extremely by that just Method of reasoning she is perfectly Mistress of joined to such Praises as from any other would look like Adulation but from her Mouth are high Reward I hope my dear  Harry  will excuse my dwelling so long on a Subject my Heart is so much interested in as it overflows with Gratitude to one who will not even suffer an Attempt to express it  My sincerest Thanks are your's for consenting lately to my so often repeated Request you may indeed be satisfied that no Avocation more pleasant will ever interfere with my Part of our Correspondence assured of this that I would  give up every Thing that is called Pleasure in this World for the real one I enjoy in conversing with youOh when shall I have that Happiness without Allay  I was not picqued at your not supposing me capable of entering the Lists of Logick with you but at your seeming to gibe at my Want of Capacity which you know is a Misfortune and not a Fault You say you  did not mean it so  I will believe it first because you say it and next because I am too lowspirited to be angry if you had meant to make me so  Perhaps my present Dejection is the Cause of my fancying myself in a bad State of Health but from a Cough which has never left me since you did and a continued Pain across my Chest I imagine myself going into a Consumption I sincerely hope I am mistaken for indeed I do not wish to part with thee I intend consulting Doctor  Dawson  when I do you shall know his Opinion 'Till then and ever be assured the Bitterness of Death hath not a Pang but what the Loss of thee will give I find myself possessed with such a gloomy Tenderness as you certainly will be angry at Oh my Heart's Treasure forgive that selfish Weakness which laments thy Absence for Joy and thou are one  For Heaven's Sake burn this Letter I am strongly tempted to write another but if I  should perhaps it would be as foolishso e'en let it go  I should complain of your having wrote oftener to  Kitty  than me and by that Means seeming more anxious about the Business of her Fortunes than my Happiness but by making an Apology you have acknowledged a Fault which is all I ever required to render my Forgiveness absolute  Adieu my dearest bestloved first and only Friend may that Happiness which I think you merit and sincerely wish you ever attend you  Frances  LETTER CXLIV  January  st  New Stile    Dear  FANNY  LET us begin this Year with greater Chearfulness than any of the Former as it is to be eleven Days shorter than the preceding ones for our Legislature have agreed at last with the  Indians  to pay Obeisance to the  Sun  and to make this Religion a Sort of Loyalty too I think they have resolved to worship it in the Decline for the Alteration of Stile is to be made in  September  Parliaments have sometimes done as notable Things as this before now For upon a Rule of the House that Questions of particular Natures should not be put after such an Hour they have voted away two or three Hours often to serve some hopeful End  I am heartily sorry for the Disappointment and Mortifications you have met with but I have known the Lady's Character you mention so long that I am very sure I shall never be surprized at any Thing she does for I dare swear she will never grow good Lady 's Character you need not put in Contrast to make it greatly esteemed  I am concerned at the Account you give of your Health and cannot say I hope that it is only your Spleen which makes you fancy yourself unwell because I think imaginary Ills worse than the present and more difficult to be cured than real ones I hope to find you soon better than you believe yourself to be  Adeiu  LETTER CXLV  Paraclete  Dear  FANNY  I HAVE suffered my Affairs to run into great Confusion by my two last Journies to  London  for I have not been here these four Months I have been at a vast Expence and nothing done as I directedHow much I want the sweet Support of your charming Converse at present to assist me at once from Spleen and Labour two Things which never at the same Time afflicted any Person who was not as whimsically compounded as myself  However I have brought my favourite  Montaigne  with me for I dare not trust myself alone and tho' I am inamoured of Solitude yet I never retire but in order to chuse my Company which I cannot always do when I live in the World Some  Dramatis Persona  says  Death is the being born to  Plato  's and to  Caesar  's  Then sure a philosophical Solitude is to live with them There is this flattering Difference between the World and a Library that there you are subject to every Fool's Humour here you can make every Wit subject to your's It is said that a Man must be a God or a Brute who can live alone Be it so but surely the Contemplation of Virtue Truth and Nature being the highest Entertainment of Angels may enable a philosophick Mind to support Retirement without Hanging or Drowning Mere Solitude or even the most learned Leisure is said to unqualify a Man for the Commerce or even the Conversation of the World and perhaps it doesbut this Objection is only from them to you not from you to yourself Dancing may be a necessary Accomplishment for the Stage but why shall a Man practise Coupees who only means to walk Such Hints as these should make a virtuous Mind the more inamoured of Fields and Groves for sure it is a high Recommendation of Truth and Honesty that the first would disappoint a Courtier's Preferment and the latter mar an Attorney's Fortune  I read over a long Chapter in  Montaigne  Yesterday absurdly stiled  of Cruelty  for the Subject is entirely on Virtue I think this Essay by much the best of all his Works and well worth frequent Reading I don't know whether any Thing he has said is the Occasion of this Observation occurring to me but I have often thought that the Writers both upon Religion and Morality have said enough about Virtue and Vice yet have not sufficiently distinguished between Vice and Vice which would be a more useful Criticism as less obvious I am realy afraid that some of the Works of our learned Divines have hardened more People thro' Despair than ever they reclaimed by Repentance proceeding too much upon a literal Construction of that Text  He who is guilty of the Breach of any Part of the Law is guilty of the Whole  Which is a Doctrine as severe against God as against ManFor then who was born to be saved My Opinion is that as there is no Vice which the Frailty of human Nature may not be led into so there is no Crime which the Divine Nature will not pardon and the most irreligious Crime is the Despairing of that Pardon The Christian Religion goes Hand in Hand with the Weakness of human Nature and the very Doctrine of Repentance without which no Man can be perfect supposes us to have erred  Christ  was a Pattern given us to imitate not to equal  However when our Saviour wishes the bitter Cup to pass by him and makes that frail Ejaculation  Eli Eli lama sabacthani  he seems to suffer with more Weakness than many Mortals have betrayed in Death or Torments But surely this was to abate the Vainglory of  Stoicism  to humble the Pride of Selfsufficiency and to shew us that God who made us as we are indulges human Weaknesses even in the most perfect Man  Farewel my charming Sinner and I wish I had half your Virtues to attone for even all my Frailties  Your's No Saint  LETTER CXLVI  Dear  HARRY  I HAVE observed since you left Town that the Letters which have passed between us have not had the least Air of a Correspondence Your's indeed are infinitely superior to any Thing I have ever seen under that Denomination being regular finished Essays while mine have been mere Acknowledgments for the Receipt of such a Treasure And if at any Time I have chanced to vary from the usual Form and given Expression to my own Thoughts which are only filled with Tenderness for you you have not deigned to take the least Notice of them To illustrate this Truth  can any Thing be more extraordinary than your addressing your Answer to the most important Concern of my Life to  Kitty  yet write to me by the same Post without ever mentioning it However the Means cannot rob me of the Pleasure I take in knowing you are well  Whatever Effect Spleen may have on my Mind I do assure you my Body without that is much disordered But I hope every Thing from clear Air Regularity and Content none of which I have the least Expectation of enjoying in  London  tho' I believe I shall not go above five or six Miles from it in Pursuit of them all My Scheme with Regard to  Hertfordshire  is quite changed but more of this when we meet You flatter me with the Hopes of seeing youDo you really think of coming Tell me and when  Mr and Mrs have left Town Mr goes to  Ireland  next  Monday  I am just going to bid him Adieu Indeed I shall be the most disconsolate of all Mortals left among those who serve only to debar me of the Pleasures of Solitude and remind me of the Absence of them I love I detest going abroad yet must be obliged to it for it will be impossible to bear Home without a Companion or the Liberty of Reading Which last should I attempt would not only be impracticable but explained into an Act of the highest Disregard and Ingratitude by my AuntIs not this a pleasant Situation  I have read six or seven Chapters of  Montaigne  but as I read regularly am not come to that you lately mentioned on  Cruelty  I like him vastly and have a Kind of Pleasure in recalling the Ideas he inspired me with some Years ago I am ashamed and sorry to tell you that I think my Understanding and Judgment were infinitely superior even in my childish Days to what they are at present I can only account for it by my Thoughts being more dissipated and eagerly engaged in a Variety of Pursuits than they then were And there being at first but a slight Foundation it was intirely destroyed in the Division I will not expatiate farther on those Merits which as I no longer possess them may appear to you quite imaginary but shall build all my Hopes of your Regard on  one  which neither Time nor Chance can alterthat of being sincerely and affectionately  Your's  LETTER CXLVII  HOW could you take me to Task so unfairly as you did about my Carelessness with Regard to your Inquiries Recollect yourself of my Letter to  Kitty  you'll find when I had sealed mine to you that Post  George  brought me your Letter from I was then writing to  Kitty  about Business and I thought the Account of my Health would come as quickly  to you by a Paragraph in her Letter as if I had broke open a Seal to inform you of it in your's This would have been such a Piece of Formality as I would be very sorry we were upon Terms to require As for the critical and philosophical Subjects of my Letters which you so genteely reprimand let me make this Apology for them That they never once diverted me from answering and observing upon every single Paragraph of your Letters and I only essay my own Fund when I have nothing better to comment upon  Your Observation upon disagreable Company is very pretty and just They destroy the Pleasures of Solitude but leave us the irksome Part of it which is the Remembrance of our absent Friends and this too in a stronger Manner than when alone by affording us an Opportunity of Comparison I am sure you make a provoking Comparison between your former and present Understanding and the Reason that you thought better of the first was because it was the weakest Our Humility increases in Proportion to our Sense and Knowledge A Person in a Valley is insensible of the narrow Circumference of his Sight but mounting up the Hill the Extent of Prospect betrays the short Limits of that Sense If you will rest your Opinion upon my Judgment in this Matter be assured that I never said any Thing either of your Sense Wit Taste or other Merits that I  did not really think to the full Extent of the Letter  I am  my dearest  Fanny  your's Au pied du Lettre  LETTER CXLVIII  Dear  FANNY  THE Lines you desire are not worth sending but to write good Verses is one Thing and to obey is another so according to your Commands take what follows  A vile Phrase and worse Matter but both preferable to the Subject I suspect these were not the Lines you enquired for and fancy those wrote in were what you meant tho' I believe I gave you them before They had some Spirit it them but alluded to secret History so much that they could not be understood without a Comment which I shall never give  Let us now proceed to Prose for I look upon Verse I mean Rhyme to be such a Device for reading or writing as the jingling Bells which our Carters use that are supposed to encourage  their Brutes to labour with more Chearfulness and I shall ever honour that Critick in the Class of false Taste who said that  Milton  wanted only the Ornament of Rhyme to render him perfect Such a Genius would cut all the Trees of a Forest into Pyramids and fashion Mount  Athos  into the Figure of a Man as was projected once by  Alexander  and shew the Power of Art by it's Violence upon Nature  To give you my Opinion of Rhyme I look upon Puns to be a Species of it as they are a Jingling of Words and a Tinkling of Sounds Indeed those who can write like you may be excused where the real Beauties of Poety render the Reader insensible to the Crambo but then this Apology is such a one as is made for the Quibbling of  Shakespear  that the false Relish of the Age required such a Condescension You use Verse as you do Cloaths not for the Ornament but in Compliance to Custom and not because you have one Blemish to cover but because you can afford to hide many Beauties  I left this Morning not that I had finished my Business there but because I had read out the only Book I had with me and was then exposed to the Mercy of the Winds and Rains which have been very severe there this Week  The only Fault I find in  Montaigne  is the Profusion of Quotations he intersperses thro' all his Works It is necessary sometimes to illustrate our Reasonings by Examples but these should be drawn from our own Observations rather than the Sentiments of others When we treat of Death Immortality  c  why need we produce the Opinions of  Plato  or  Seneca  upon these Subjects We dare not depend on our own Strength but lean upon others and often support weak Judgments by the Force of Authority This is one of the Reasons we make such slow Progress of late in Science or Philosophy for we follow one another in such beaten Tracks that our View cannot be extended farther than to the Person who goes before us and are afraid of turning to the Right or Left lest we should lose our Way I am so disatisfied with Quotations that I run into the contrary Extreme and endeavour to avoid them as much as others do to bring them in insomuch that I often shun the very Thoughts which naturally occur to me in writing or speaking if I recollect they have been made use of upon the same Occasion before This is perhaps an Affection greater than the other and may fall under the Censure objected to Writings of this Kind that those who will not condescend to say any Thing which has been said before them will probably never say any Thing which will be quoted after them But this last  Nicety perhaps I owe to my Correspondence with you lest I should be suspected of Plagiarism as you have read every Thing which I am capable of Understanding yet I have a more humble Reason for avoiding Quotations that I don't care to give People an Opportunity of making Comparisons to my Disadvantage  There is a Passage in  Montaigne  which I am particularly flattered with because it puts me in Mind of a bold Expression and Sentiment of mine in a former Letter to you  that I had so compleat a Possession of you that I enjoyed your very Absence  or Words to that Purpose Speaking of a Friend he loved he says  A Correspondence destroys Absence as it gives us a Liberty of conversing together We better filled and extended the Possession of Life in being parted He lived rejoiced and saw for me and I for him as plainly as if he had himself been there One Part remained idle and we confounded one another when we were together Distance of Place rendered the Conjunction of our Wills more rich The insatiable Desire of personal Presence somewhat implies Weakness in the Fruition of Souls  Nothing can he more finely imagined or better expressed than this whole Passage after which I will not venture to add any Thing of my own but conclude in his Words  While natural Conveniencies fail  let us supply the Defect with those that are artificial  Farewel  my Love my Friend  Henry  LETTER CXLIX  My dear  FANNY  I AM jealous of you from your last Letter You say  H G  and  J S  make such a Noise in the Room that you cannot attend to what you are writing I don't care that you should divide yourself between your common Acquaintance and me and am such a Churl that I have no Enjoyment either of your Conversation or Correspondence but when I have them entirely to myself  Adam  relating she sole Auditress  When I write to you my whole Soul is yours I am not however so selfish or rather I am so selfish as to be willing to communicate your charming Converse to those few who have a just Relish for your Wit and Sense for this is but enlarging my own Capacity and increasing my Comprehension which is too narrow to enjoy the Fullness of the Feast  If I appear to have a better Philosophy or more refined Sense than formerly it is but to accommodate myself to your Sentiments and Taste which by the Continuance of your Favour may perhaps strengthen Habit into Nature However in general I endeavour to  appear to you what I really in myself am because I cannot be otherwise assured either of your Love or Esteem I am certain that by shewing myself in this Light I may lessen both But then I secure those Portions of each which I may honestly or prudently claim All farther Regard is but paid to something foreign from me and I should be jealous of your Attachments even to an imaginary Personshould I pretend to more Knowledge Virtue or Philosophy than I possess what should I do more than idly raise Sentiments or Affections in you which I am not able to gratify And would be a Sort of Weaning you from your Attachments to me as if a Peasantlover should endeavour to inspire his  Amaryllis  with high Notions of Pomp Riches and Grandeur  All the Hazard I run from my free Commerce with you is that as Presumption and Selfsufficiency are apt to get the Start of Sense or Knowledge your Praise and Approbation may give me such a Vanity as possessed antient Heroes with an Opinion of their being more than Human but that the Charms of your Person tempt me often to recollect my Manhood However the vain Apotheosis may still remain when I reflect that God's themselves have been inamoured of mortal Women less amiable than you who have every Perfection of the most Eminent of your Sex without their Extremes The Philosophy of  Portia  without her Stoicism  all the Love of  Sappho  without her Wantonness the Wit of  Heloise  without her Prophaneness and the Spirit of  Cleopatra  without her Extravagance  Write to me my charming  Epitome  but never when you have any Thing else to do  Adieu  Henry  End of the  FIRST VOLUME  N B  The first Letter of the Second Volume is by Mistake of the Printer numbered  CLXXX  whereas it should be only  CL
