Fix'd on the solid base of adamantine fame  J T TO MEM OF GRAY  EDINBURG AT THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY  THOMAS GRAY the subject of this narrative was the fifth son of Mr Philip Gray whose father was a considerable merchant and who himself was engaged in business  A moneyscrlvener  though not to the pecuniary advantage of his family for being of a shy and indolent temper he suffered those opportunities of improving his fortune to escape him which others would have eagerly embraced His son Thomas was born Dec th in Cornhill London and sent early to Eton school under the tuition of Mr Antrobus his maternal uncle This gentleman being both a good scholar and a man of taste was assiduous in directing the attention of his nephew to those sources of improvement which he afterwards applied to with so much success During the time of Mr Gray's continuance in this abode of the Muses he contracted the strictest intimacy with two of their votaries whose dispositions in many respects were congenial with his own One of these was the Honourable Horace Walpole who hath been so long conspicuous for his skill in the fine arts and his love of letters the other Richard West Esq son to a late lord chancellor of Ireland and grandson by his mother to the celebrated Bishop Burnet As the accident of his uncle's being an assistant at Eton was the  cause of his going thither for his classical learning so to this gentleman's being Fellow of Peterhouse in Cambridge it was owing that he was sent to the same university and admitted in the year a Pensioner of the same college  The relish Mr Gray had contracted for polite literature before his removal to Cambridge rendered the abstruse studies which then almost wholly engrossed and at present too much occupy the attention of young men altogether tasteless and irkfome still  "Song was his favourite and first pursuit"  and tho' his thoughts were directed towards the law as a profession for life yet like Garrick in the picture between Tragedy and Comedy he hung back with fond reluctance on the Muse Nor was this bias of his inclination a little influenced by the constant exhortations of his two friends particularly Mr West who was now removed to Christ's Church Oxford and whose propensity to poetry and dislike to the law appear to have even exceeded his own After having passed four years in college Mr Gray returned to his father in Town where he remained till the following spring at which time Mr Walpole being about to travel invited his friend to go along with him The invitation was accepted and they accordingly set out for Italy together but some disagreement arising between them occasioned as Mr Walpole ingenuously confesses less by his companion's conduct than his own  they parted at Rheggio from whence after having made a short stay at Venice Mr Gray returned The time however devoted to this excursion was by no means lost nothing that our poet saw was suffered to escape him From no relation though purposely designed for the publick eye can so much information be drawn as from his casual letters During this interval of his friend's absence Mr West finding that his aversion to the profession for which he had destined himself and with a view to which he had resided some time in the Temple became almost insuperable wrote to Mr Gray on the subject expressing in the strongest manner the  ennui  that almost overwhelmed him To this letter an answer was returned which presents the finest picture of the writer's mind and abounds with a justness of thinking far beyond his years Gray was now at Florence where he had spent in all eleven months amusing himself at intervals with poetical compositions It was here that he conceived the design and produced the first book of a didactick poem in Latin entitled  De Principiis Cogitandi  and addressed to Mr West a work which he unfortunately never completed From Florence proceeding to Venice he returned to England deviating but little from the route he had gone but particularly taking once more in his way the Grand Chartreuse where in this visit he wrote on the album of that monastery the following Alcaick ode  Oh Tu severi Religio loci  Quocunque gaudes nomine non leve  Nativa nam certè fluenta  Numen habet veteresque sylvas  Praesentiorem et conspicimus Deum  Per invias rupes fera per juga  Clivosque praeruptos sonantes  Inter aquas nemorumque noctem  Quâm si repòstus sub trabe citreâ  Fulgeret auro et Phidiacâ manu  Salve vocanti ritè fesso et  Da placidam juveni quietem  Quod si invidendis sedibus et frui  Fortuna sacrâ lege silentii  Vetat volentem me resorbens  In medios violenta fluctus  Saltem remoto des Pater angulo  Horas senectae ducere liberas  Tutumque vulgari tumultu  Surripias hominumque curis  On the st of September he arrived in London where he had not been much more than two months before his father was carried off by the gout a malady from which he had long and severely suffered As the inactivity and ill health of the elder Mr Gray had prevented him from accumulating the fortune he might have acquired with ease so his imprudence had induced him to squander no inconsiderable part of what he possessed The son therefore finding his patrimony inadequate to the profession he had intended to follow without diminishing the income of his mother  and his aunt resolved for this reason to relinquish it yet to silence their importunities on the subject he proposed only to change the line of it and accordingly went to Cambridge in the year to take his Bachelor's degree But the inconveniencies incident to a scanty fortune were not the only evils he had now to combat Poor West the friend of his heart was overborne by a consumption and family distresses and these alas were burthens which friendship could not remove After languishing a considerable time under their united oppression this amiable youth fell a victim to both on the st of June at Pope's and was interred in the chancel of Hatfield church beneath a stone bearing the epitaph below  Here lieth the body of Richard West Esq only son to the Right Hon Richard West Esq late Lord Chancellor of Ireland who died the st of June in the th year of his age    From the time of Mr Gray's return out of Italy to the date of this melancholy event he seems to have employed himself chiefly in writing for in this interval he communicated to Mr West the  fragment of his tragedy and several other pieces  The shock however of so severe a stroke disarranged his plans and broke off his designs The only addition he afterwards made to his didactick poem is the apostrophe to the friend he had lost  Hactenus haud segnis Naturae arcana retexi  Musarum interpres primusque Britanna per arva  Romano liquidum deduxi flumine rivum  Cum Tu opere in medio spes tanti et causa laborls  Linquis et aeternam fati te condis in umbram  Vidi egomet duro graviter concussa dolore  Pectora in alterius non unquam lenta dolorem  Et languere oculos vidi et pallescere amantem  Vultum quo nunquam Pietas nisi rara Fidesque  Altus amor Veri et purum spirabat Honestum  Visa tamen tardi demùm inclementia morbi  Cessare est reducemque iterum roseo ore Salutem  Speravi atque unà tecum dilecte Favoni  Credulus heu longos ut quondam fallere Soles  Heu spes nequicquam dulces atque irrita vota  Heu maestos Soles sine te quos ducere flendo  Per desideria et questus jam cogor inanes  At Tu sancta anima et nostri non indiga luctus  Stellanti templo sincerique aetheris igne  Unde orta es fruere atque o si secura nec ultra  Mortalis notos olim miserata labores  Respectes tenuesque vacet cognoscere curas  Humanam si fortè alta de sede procellam  Contemplere metus stimulosque cupidinis acres  Gaudiaque et gemitus parvoque in corde tumultum  Irarum ingentem et saevos sub pectore fluctus  Respice et has lacrymas memori quas ictus amore  Fundo quod possum juxtà lugere sepulchrum  Dum juvat et mutae vana haec jactare favillae  and nothing can more pathetically  display the feelings of a heart wounded by such a loss than that apostrophe and the sonnet in which he gave them vent  In vain to me the smiling mornings shine  And redd'ning Phoebus lifts his golden fire  The birds in vain their am'rous descant join  Or cheerful fields resume their green attire  These ears alas for other notes repine  A diff'rent object do these eyes require  My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine  And in my breast th' imperfect joys expire  Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer  And newborn pleasure brings to happier men  The fields to all their wonted tribute bear  To warm their little loves the birds complain  I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear  And weep the more because I weep in vain  The Ode to Spring was written early in June at Stoke whither he had gone to visit his mother and sent to Mr West before Mr Gray had heard of his death how he employed his pen when this ode was returned to him with the melancholy news we have already seen Impressions of grief on the generality of mankind like characters marked on the sand of the sea are speedily effaced by the influx of business or pleasure but the traces of them on the heart of Gray were too deeply inscribed to be soon obliterated we shall not therefore wonder at the subjects he has chosen nor at the solemnity with which he hath treated them His Ode on the Prospect of Eton College as well as the Hymn to Adversity were both written in the following August and it is highly probable that the Elegy in the Country Church yard was begun also about this time  Having made a visit of some length at Stoke to his mother and aunt our poet returned to Cambridge which from this period became his principal home The conveniencies resulting from that situation to a person of circumscribed fortune and a studious temper were in his estimation more than a counterbalance for the dislike which on several accounts he bore to  the place Less pleased with exerting his own powers than in contemplating the exertions of others he almost wholly devoted himself to the best writers of Greece and so assiduously did he apply to the study of their works as in the course of six years to have read with critical exactness almost every author of note in that language During this interval however he was not so entirely occupied with his stated employment as to have no time for expressing his aversion to the ignorance and dulness which appeared to surround him but of what he intended on this subject a short fragment only remains  In the year he appears to have given up entirely his didactick poem and to have relinquished for sometime at least any further solicitations of the Muse Mr Walpole notwithstanding being desirous to preserve what he had already written and to perpetuate the merit of their deceased friend importuned Mr Gray to publish his own poems together with those of Mr West but this Mr Gray declined from the apprehension that the joint stock of both would hardly fill a small volume▪ A favourite cat belonging to Mr Walpole happening about this time to be drowned Mr Gray amused himself with writing on the occasion an elegant little ode in which he hath happily united both humour and instruction But the following year was distinguished by a far more important effort of his Muse the Fragment on Education and Government which is  superiour to every thing in the same style of writing that our own language can boast of and perhaps any other  ESSAY I    Theoc  As sickly plants betray a niggard earth  Whose barren bosom starves her gen'rous birth  Nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains  Their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins  And as in climes where Winter holds his reign  The soil tho' fertile will not teem in vain  Forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise  Nor trusts her blossoms to the churlish skies  So draw mankind in vain the vital airs  Unform'd unfriended by those kindly cares  That health and vigour to the soul impart  Spread the young thought and warm the op'ning heart  So fond Instruction on the growing pow'rs  Of Nature idly lavishes her stores  If equal Justice with unclouded face  Smile not indulgent on the rising race  And scatter with a free tho' frugal hand  Light golden show'rs of plenty o'er the land  But Tyranny has fix'd her empire there  To check their tender hopes with chilling fear  And blast the blooming promise of the year  This spacious animated scene survey  From where the rolling orb that gives the day  His sable sons with nearer course surrounds  To either pole and life's remotest bounds  How rude soe'er th' exterior form we find  Howe'er opinion tinge the vary'd mind  Alike to all the kind impartial Heav'n  The sparks of truth and happiness has giv'n  With sense to feel with mem'ry to retain  They follow pleasure and they fly from pain  Their judgment mends the plan their fancy draws  Th' event presages and explores the cause  The soft returns of gratitude they know  By fraud clude by force repel the foe  While mutual wishes mutual woes endear  The social smile and sympathetick tear  Say then thro' ages by what fate confin'd  To diff'rent climes seem diff'rent souls assign'd  Here measur'd Laws and philosophick Ease  Fix and improve the polish'd arts of peace  There Industry and Gain their vigils keep  Command the winds and tame th' unwilling deep  Here force and hardy deeds of blood prevail  There languid Pleasure sighs in ev'ry gale  Oft' o'er the trembling nations from afar  Has Scythia breath'd the living cloud of war  And where the deluge burst with sweepy sway  Their arms their kings their gods were roll'd away  As oft' have issu'd host impelling host  The blueey'd myriads from the Baltick coast  The prostrate South to the destroyer yields  Her boasted titles and her golden fields  With grim delight the brood of Winter view  A brighter day and heav'ns of azure hue  Scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose  And quaff the pendent vintage as it grows  Proud of the yoke and pliant to the rod  Why yet does Asia dread a monarch's nod  While European freedom still withstands  Th' encroaching tide that drowns her less'ning lands  And sees far off with an indignant groan  Her native plains and empires once her own  Can op'ner skies and suns of fiercer flame  O'erpow'r the fire that animates our frame  As lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray  Fade and expire beneath the eye of day  Need we the influence of the northern star  To string our nerves and steel our hearts to war  And where the face of Nature laughs around  Must sick'ning Virtue fly the tainted ground  Unmanly thought what seasons can controul  What fancy'd zone can circumscribe the soul  Who conscious of the source from whence the springs  By Reason's light on Resolution's wings  Spite of her frail companion dauntless goes  O'er Lybia's deserts and thro' Zembla's snows  She bids each slumb'ring energy awake  Another touch another temper take  Suspends th' inferiour laws that rule our clay  The stubborn elements confess her sway  Their little wants their low desires refine  And raise the mortal to a height divine  Not but the human fabrick from the birth  Imbibes a flavour of its parent earth  As various tracks enforce a various toil  The manners speak the idiom of their soil  An iron race the mountaincliffs maintain  Foes to the gentler genius of the plain  For where unweary'd sinews must be found  With sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground  To turn the torrent's swiftdescending flood  To brave the savage rushing from the wood  What wonder if to patient valour train'd  They guard with spirit what by strength they gain'd  And while their rocky ramparts round they see  The rough abode of Want and Liberty  As lawless force from confidence will grow  Insult the plenty of the vales below  What wonder in the sultry climes that spread  Where Nile redundant o'er his summerbed  From his broad bosom life and verdure flings  And broods o'er Aegypt with his wat'ry wings  If with advent'rous oar and ready sail  The dusky people drive before the gale  Or on frail floats to neighb'ring cities ride  That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide  How much it is to be wished that Gray instead of compiling chronological tables had completed what he thus admirably begun In the year he put his last hand to the Elegy in the Country Churchyard which when finished was communicated first to Mr Walpole and by him to several persons of distinction I his brought Mr Gray acquainted with Lady Cobham and furnished an occasion for his Long Story a composition in which the different colours of wit and humour are peculiarly and not less intimately blended than the shifting hues on the faces of a diamond The elegy having been for some time privately transmitted from onehand to another at length found its way into publick through The Magazine of Magazines This disgraceful mode of appearance subjected the Author to the necessity of exhibiting it under a less disadvantageous form and Mr Bentley soon after wishing to supply every ornament that his pencil could contribute drew not only for it but also for the rest of Mr Gray's productions  The headpiece to the Long Story exhibiting a view of StokePogeis church and mansion was copied from a sketch by Mr Gray The Churchyard was the subject of his elegy  a set of designs which were handsomely repaid by some very beautiful stanzas of which unfortunately no perfect copy remains In the March of Mr Gray sustained a loss which he long severely felt his mother to whom his conduct was exemplary for the discharge of every filial duty and who merited all  the tenderness and attention she received was taken from him by death The lines in which Mr Pope hath expressed his piety beautiful as they are and much as they deserve to be praised appear notwithstanding to excite less of sympathy than a single stroke in the epitaph on Mrs Gray  Here sleep the remains of  Dorothy Gray    widow the careful tender mother  of many children one of whom alone  had the misfortune to survive her  or a passage in a letter to Mr Mason written the following December on the deaths of his father and friend  "I have seen the scene you describe and know how dreadful it is I know too I am the better for it We are all idle and thoughtless things and have no sense no use in the world any longer than that sad impression lasts  the deeper it is engraved the better  "  Mr Gray as is evident by a letter to Dr Wharton had finished his Ode on the Progress of Poetry early in his Bard also was begun about this time and in the year following the beautiful fragment on the Pleasures of Vicissitude From the loose hints in his commonplacebook he appears to have planned a fourth ode on the connexion between genius and grandeur but it cannot now be ascertained if any part of it was actually written A vacancy in the office of PoetLaureate was occasioned in by the death of Colley Cibber The Duke of Devonshire  being at that time Chamberlain made a polite offer of it to Mr Gray through the hands of Lord John Cavendish his brother but the disgrace brought upon that office by the profligacy and inability of some who had filled it probably induced Mr Gray to decline the appointment This part of our poet's life was chiefly devoted to literary pursuits and the cultivation of friendship It is obvious from the testimony of his letters that he was indefatigable in the former and that he was always ready to perform kind offices in the latter Sir William Williams an accomplished and gallant young officer having been killed at Bellisle his friend Mr Fred Montagu proposed to erect a monument over him and with this view requested Mr Gray to furnish the epitaph His slight acquaintance with Sir William would have been a sufficient reason for declining the task but the friendliness of Mr Montagu's disposition and the sincerity of affliction with which he was affected wrought so powerfully upon Mr Gray that he could not refuse him though he was by no means able to satisfy himself with the verses he wrote The professorship of modern languages and history in the University of Cambridge becoming vacant in through the death of Mr Turner Mr Gray was spirited up by some of his friends to ask of Lord Bute the succession His application however failed the office having been promised to Lady Lowther for the tutor of Sir James from a motive which reflected more honour on her  Ladyship than on the gentleman who succeeded In Mr Gray ever attached to the beauties of Nature as well as to the love of antiquities undertook a journey to Scotland for the purpose of gratifying his curiosity and taste During his stay in this country Dr Beattie though not the first of philosophers yet a poet inferiour to none since the death of his friend and whom he in many respects resembled found the means of engaging his notice and friendship Through the intervention of this gentleman the Marisehal College of Aberdeen had requested to know if the degree of Doctor of Laws would be acceptable to Gray but this mark of their attention he civilly declined In December Dr Beattie still desirous that his country should afford some testimony of its regard to the merit of our poet solicited his permission to print at the University press of Glasgow an elegant edition of his Works Dodsley had before asked the like favour and Mr Gray unwilling to refuse gratified both with a copy containing a few notes and the imitations of the old Norwegian poetry intended to supplant the Long Story which was printed at first only to illustrate Mr Bentley's designs The death of Mr Brocket in the July following left another opening to the professorship which he had before unsuccessfully sought Lord Bute however was not in office and the Duke of Grafton to preclude a request within two days of the vacancy appointed Mr Gray Cambridge before  had been his residence from choice it now became so from obligation and the greater part of his time there was filled up by his old engagements or diverted to new ones It has been suggested that he once embraced the project of republishing Strabo and there are reasons to believe that he meant it as the many geographical disquisitions he left behind him appear to have been too minute for the gratification of general inquiry The like observation may be transferred to Plato and the Greek Anthologia as he had taken uncommon pains with both and has left a ms of the latter fit for the press His design of favouring the publick with the history of English poetry may be spoken of with more certainty as in this he had not only engaged with Mr Mason as a colleague but actually paraphrased the Norse and Welsh poems inserted in his Works for specimens of the wild spirit which animated the bards of ancient days The extensive compass however of the subject and the knowledge that it was also in the hands of Mr Warton induced him to relinquish what he had thus successfully begun Nor did his love for the antiquities of his country confine his researches to its poetry alone the structures of our ancestors and their various improvements particularly engaged his attention Hitherto there hath nothing so authentick and accurate on the subject of Gothick architecture appeared as the observations upon it drawn up by Mr Gray and inserted by Mr Bentham in his Hist of Ely Of heraldry its correlative science  he possessed the entire knowledge But of the various pursuits which employed his studies for the last ten years of his life none were so acceptable as those which explained the economy of Nature For botany he acquired a taste of his uncle when young and the exercise which for the sake of improvement in this branch of the science he induced himself to take contributed not a little to the preservation of his health How considerable his improvements in it were those only can tell who have seen his additions to Hudson and his notes on Linnaeus While confined to zoology he successfully applied his discoveries to illustrate Aristotle and others of the Ancients From engagements of this kind Mr Gray's attention was neither often nor long diverted Excepting the time he gave up to experiments on flowers for the purpose of investigating the process of vegetation which can scarcely be called a relaxation from his stated occupations his only amusement was musick nor was his acquaintance with this art less than with others of much more importance His skill was acquired from the productions of the best composers out of whose works when in Italy he had made a selection Vocal musick he chiefly preferred The harpsichord was his favourite instrument but though far from remarkable for a finished execution yet he accommodated his voice so judiciously to his playing as to give an auditor considerable pleasure His judgment in statuary and painting was exquisite and formed from an almost  instinctive perception of those graces beyond the reach of art in which the divine works of the great masters abound As it was through the unsolicited favour of the Duke of Grafton that Mr Gray was enabled to follow the bent of his own inclination in the choice of his studies we shall not be surprised to find from a letter to Dr Beattie that gratitude prompted him to offer his firstling  O Meliboee Deus nobis haec otia fecit  Nanque erit ille mihi semper Deus illius aram  Saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus  Ille meas errare boves ut cernis et ipsum  Ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti  Accordingly on his Grace's being elected Chancellor of the University Mr Gray unasked took upon him to write those verses which are usually set to musick on this occasion and whatever the sarcastick Junius notwithstanding his handsome compliment to the poet might pretend this was the offering of no venal Muse The ode in its structure is dramatick and it contains nothing of the complimentary kind which is not entirely suited to the characters employed Not long after the bustle of the installation was over Mr Gray made an excursion to the sequestered lakes of Westmoreland and Cumberland The impressions he there received from the wonderful scenery that every where surrounded him he transmitted to his friend Dr Wharton in epistolary journals with all the wildness of Salvator and the softness of Claude Writing in May to the same friend he complains of a  violent cough which had troubled him for three months and which he called incurable adding that till this year he never knew what mechancial low spirits were One circumstance that without doubt contributed to the latter complaint was the anxiety he felt from holding as a sinecure an office the duties of which he thought himself bound to perform The object of his professorship being twofold and the patent allowing him to effect one of its designs by deputy it is understood that he liberally rewarded for that purpose the teachers in the University of Italian and French The other part he himself prepared to execute but tho' the professorship was instituted in none of his predecessors had furnished a plan Embarassed by this and other difficulties and retarded by ill health the undertaking at length became so irksome that he seriously proposed to relinquish the chair Towards the close of May he removed from Cambridge to Town after having suffered from flying attacks of an hereditary gout to which he had long been subject and from which a life of singular temperance could not protect him In London his indisposition having increased the physician advised him to change his lodgings in Jermynstreet for others at Kensington This change was of so much benefit that he was soon enabled to return to Cambridge from whence he meditated a journey to his friend Dr Wharton which he hoped might reestablish his health but his intentions and hopes were delusive  On the th of July a violent sickness came on him while at dinner in the Collegehall the gout had fixed on his stomach and resisted all the powers of medicine On the th he was seized by a strong convulsion which the next day returned with additional force and the evening after he expired At the first seizure he was aware of his danger and tho' sensible at intervals almost to the last he betrayed no dread of the terrours of death  To delineate his portrait in this place would be needless The reader will acquire the best idea of his character if after perusing his life and his writings he will use his own memory a sa cylindrick mirror and collect into one assemblage the scattered features Of Mr Gray's religious opinions but little is known there are however sufficient traces left to shew him a believer To Lord Bolingbroke's atheism he hath written an answer His sentiments of Lord Saftesbury cannot be mistaken and both Voltaire and Hume he censures with freedom In private life he was most respected by those who best knew him his heart was benevolent and his hand liberal  On his poems it will be needless to bestow praises or to repel the attacks of envy and rancour If Mr Gray was not a poet of the first order there is no poetry existing and if his bold expressions be nonsense so are the best passages of Shakespeare and Milton and the sublimest figures of divine inspiration  THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF MR THOMAS GRAY  Extracted from the registry of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury  IN the name of God  Amen  I Thomas Gray

GOSTLING  jun  THE TEARS OF GENIUS  AN ODE TO THE MEMORY OF MR GRAY  By J T    ON Cham's fair banks where Learning's hallow'd fane  Majestick rises on th' astonish'd sight  Where oft' the Muse has led the fav'rite swain  And warm'd his soul with heav'n's inspiring light  Beneath the covert of the sylvan shade  Where deadly cypress mix'd with mournful yew  Far o'er the vale a gloomy stillness spread  Celestial Genius burst upon the view  The bloom of youth the majesty of years  The soften'd aspect innocent and kind  The sigh of sorrow and the streaming tears  Resistless all their various pow'r combin'd  In her fair hand a silver harp she bore  Whose magick notes soft warbling from the string  Give tranquil joys the breast ne'er knew before  Or raise the soul on rapture's airy wing  By grief

THE PROGRESS OF POESY PINDARICK  Advertisement  WHEN the Author first published this and the following ode he was advised even by his friends to subjoin some few explanatory notes but had too much respect for the understanding of his readers to take that liberty    PINDAR Olymp ii  I  AWAKE Aeolian lyre awake  Awake my glory awake lute and harp  David's Psalms  Pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompaniements  Aeolian song Aeolian strings the breath of the Aeolian fluteThe subject and simile as usual with Pindar are here united The various sources of poetry which gives life and lustre to all it touches are here described as well in its quiet majestick progress enriching every subject otherwise dry and barren with all the pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers as in its more rapid and irresistible course when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions    And give to rapture all thy trembling strings  From Helicon's harmonious springs  A thousand rills their mazy progress take  The laughing flow'rs that round them blow  Drink life and fragrance as they flow  Now the rich stream of musick winds along  Deep majestick smooth and strong  Thro' verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign  Now rowling down the steep amain  Headlong impetuous see it pour  The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar  I  Oh Sov'reign  Power of harmony to calm the turbulent passions of the soul The thoughts are borrowed from the first Pythian of Pindar  of the willing soul  Parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs  Enchanting shell the sullen Cares  And frantick Passions hear thy soft controul  On Thracia's hills the lord of War  Has curb'd the fury of his car  And dropp'd his thirsty lance at thy command  Perching on the sceptred hand  This is a weak imitation of some beautiful lines in the same ode  Of Jove thy magick lulls the feather'd king  With ruffled plumes and flagging wing  Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie  The terrour of his beak and lightnings of his eye  I  Thee  Power of harmony to produce all the graces of motion in the body  the voice the dance obey  Temper'd to thy warbled lay  O'er Idalia's velvet green  The

notes in cadence beating  Glance their manytwinkling feet  Homer Od Θ    Slowmelting strains their queen's approach declare  Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay  With arms sublime that float upon

chiefs and dusky loves  Her track where'er the goddess roves  Glory pursue and gen'rous shame  Th' unconquerable mind and freedom's holy flame  II  Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep  Progress of poetry from Greece to Italy and from Italy to England Chaucer was not unacquainted with the writings of Dante or of Petrarch The Earl of Surry and Sir Thomas Wyatt had travelled in Italy and formed their taste there Spenser imitated the Italian writers Milton improved on them but this school expired soon after the restoration and a new one arose on the French model which has subsisted ever since    Isles that crown th' Aegean deep  Fields that cool Ilissus laves  Or where Maeander's amber waves  In ling'ring lab'rinths creep  How do your tuneful echoes languish  Mute but to the voice of Anguish  Where each old poetick mountain  Inspiration breath'd around  Ev'ry shade and hallow'd fountain  Murmur'd deep a solemn sound  Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour  Left their Parnassus

yon' footstep dread  c    Oh lyre divine what daring spirit  Wakes thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor ample pinion  That the Theban eagle bear  Olymp ii  Pindar compares himself to that bird and his enemies to ravens that croak and clamour in vain below while it pursues its flight regardless of their noise    Sailing with supreme dominion  Thro' the azure deep of air  Yet oft' before his infant eyes would run  Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray  With orient hues unborrow'd of the sun  Yet shall he mount and keep his distant way  Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate  Beneath the

country ordered all the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  I  ' RUIN seize thee ruthless King  ' Confusion on thy banners wait  ' Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing  ' They mock

friend of giving a history of English poetry in the introduction to it be meant to have produced some specimens of the style that reigned in ancient times among the neighbouring nations or those who had subdued the greater part of this island and were our progenitors the following three imitations made a part of them He afterwards dropped his design especially after he had heard that it was already in the hands of a person well qualified to do it justice both by his taste and his researches into antiquity  PREFACE  IN the th century Sigurd Earl of the OrkneyIslands went with a fleet of

STORY  Advertisement  MR GRAY's Flegy previous to its publication was handed about in ms and had amongst other admirers the Lady Cobham who resided in the mansionhouse at StokePogeis The performance inducing her to wish for the Author's acquaintance Lady Schaub and Miss Speed then at her house undertook to introduce her to it These two ladies waited upon the Author at his aunt's solitary habitation where he at that time resided and not finding him at home they left a card behind them Mr Gray surprised at such a compliment returned the visit and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some appearance of romance he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the Long Story contains  IN Britain's isle no matter where  An ancient pile of building stands  The mansionhouse at StokePogeis then in the possession of Viscountess Cobham The style of building which we now call Queen Elizabeth's is here admirably described both with regard to its beauties and defects and the third and fourth stanzas delineate the fantastick manners of her time with equal truth and humour The house formerly belonged to the Earls of Huntingdon and the family of Hatton    The Huntingdons and Hattons there  Employ'd the pow'r of Fairy hands  To raise the ceiling's fretted height  Each pannel in achievements clothing  Rich windows that exclude the light  And passages that lead to nothing  Full oft' within the spacious walls  When he had fifty winters o'er him  My grave LordKeeper  Sir Christopher Hatton promoted by Queen Elizabeth for his graceful person and fine dancingBrawls were a sort of figuredance then in vogue and probably deemed as elegant as our modern cotillons or still more modern quadrilles  led the brawls  The seal and maces danc'd before him  His bushy beard and shoestrings green  His highcrown'dhat and sattin doublet  Mov'd the stout heart of England's queen  Tho' Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it  What in the very first beginning  Shame of the versifying tribe  Your hist'ry whether are you spinning  Can you do nothing but describe  A house there is and that's enough  From whence one fatal morning issues  A brace of warriours  The reader is already apprised who these ladies were the two descriptions are prettily contrasted and nothing can be more happily turned than the compliment to Lady Cobham in the eighth stanza  not in buff  But rustling in their silks and tissues  The first came  capapee  from France  Her conq'ring destiny fulfilling  Whom meaner beauties eye askance  And vainly ape her art of killing  The other Amazon kind Heav'n  Had arm'd with spirit wit and satire  But Cobham had the polish giv'n  And tipp'd her arrows with goodnature  To celebrate her eyes her air  Coarse panegyricks would but tease her  Melissa is her  nom de guerre  Alas who would not wish to please her  With bonnet blue and capuchine  And aprons long they hid their armour  And veil'd their weapons bright and keen  In pity to the country farmer  Fame in the shape of Mr P  t  I have been told that this gentleman a neighbour and acquaintance of Mr Gray's in the country was much displeased at the liberty here taken with his name yet surely without any great reason  By this time all the parish know it  Had told that thereabouts there lurk'd  A wicked imp they call a Poet  Who prowl'd the country far and near  Bewitch'd the children of the peasants  Dry'd up the cows and lam'd the deer  And suck'd the eggs and kill'd the pheasants  My Lady heard their joint petition  Swore by her coronet and ermine  She'd issue out her high commission  To rid the manor of such vermine  The heroines undertook the task  Thro' lanes unknown o'er stiles they ventur'd  Rapp'd at the door nor stay'd to ask  But bounce into the parlour enter'd  The trembling family they daunt  They flirt they sing they laugh they tattle  Rummage his mother pinch his aunt  And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle  Each hole and cupboard they explore  Each creek and cranny of his chamber  Run hurryskurry round the floor  And o'er the bed and tester clamber  Into the drawers and china pry  Papers and books a huge imbroglio  Under a teacup he might lie  Or creas'd like dogscars in a folio  On the first marching of the troops  The Muses hopeless of his pardon  Convey'd him underneath their hoops  To a small closet in the garden  So Rumour says who will believe  But that they left the door ajar  Where safe and laughing in his sleeve  He heard the distant din of war  Short was his joy he little knew  The pow'r of magick was no fable  Out of the window wisk they flew  But left a spell upon the table  The words too eager to unriddle  The Poet felt a strange disorder  Transparent birdlime form'd the middle  And chains invisible the border  So cunning was the apparatus  The pow'rful pothooks did so move him  That will he nill he to the great house  He went as if the devil drove him  Yet on his way no sign of grace  For folks in fear are apt to pray  To Phoebus he preferr'd his case  And begg'd his aid that dreadful day  The godhead would have back'd his quarrel  But with a blush on recollection  Own'd that his quiver and his laurel  'Gainst four such eyes were no protection  The court was sat the culprit there  Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping  The Lady Janes and Joans repair  And from the gallery stand peeping  Such as in silence of the night  Come sweep along some winding entry  Styack  The housekeeper  has often seen the sight  Or at the chapeldoor stand sentry  In peakedhoods and mantles tarnish'd  Sour visages enough to scare ye  High dames of honour once that garnish'd  The drawingroom of fierce Queen Mary  The peeress comes the audience stare  And doff their hats with due submission  She court'sies as she takes her chair  To all the people of condition  The Bard with many an artful sib  Had in imagination fenc'd him  Disprov'd the arguments of Squib  The steward    And all that Groom  Groom of the chamber  could urge against him  But soon his rhetorick forsook him  When he the solemn hall had seen  A sudden fit of ague shook him  He stood as mute as poor Macleane  A famous highwayman hanged the week before    Yet something he was heard to mutter  " How in the park beneath an oldtree  " Without design to hurt the butter  " Or any malice to the poultry  " He once or twice had penn'd a sonnet  " Yet hop'd that he might save his bacon  " Numbers would give their oaths upon it  " He ne'er was for a conj'rer taken"  The ghostly prudes with hagged  Hagged  i e  the face of a witch or hag the epithet  hagard  has been sometimes mistaken as conveying the same idea but it means a very different thing  viz  wild and farouche and is taken from an unreclaimed hawk called an hagard  face  Already had condemn'd the sinner  My Lady rose and with a grace  She smil'd and bid him come to dinner  Here the story finishes the exclamation of the ghosts which follows is characteristick of the Spanish manners of the age when they are supposed to have lived and the stanzas said to be lost may be imagined to contain the remainder of their longwinded expostulation    " JesuMaria Madam Bridget  " Why what can the Viscountess mean"  Cry'd the square hoods in woful fidget  " The times are alter'd quite and clean  " Decorum's turn'd to mere civility  " Her air and all her manners shew it  " Commend me to her affability  " Speak to a Commoner and Poet"  Here stanzas are lost  And so God save our noble king  And guard us from longwinded lubbers  That to eternity would sing  And keep my lady from her rubbers  ELEGY  WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD  THE curfew tolls  squilla di lontano  Che paia 'l giorno pianger che si muore  Dante Purgat  the knell of parting day  The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea  The ploughman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The moping owl does to the moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Modest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtree's shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever

rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy housewife ply her ev'ningcare  No children run to lisp their sire's return  Or climb his knees the envy'd kiss to share  Oft' did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their furrow oft' the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Await alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye Proud impute to these the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze

growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade thro' slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious Truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous Shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  This part of the Elegy differs from the first copy the following stanza was excluded with the other alterations  Hark how the sacred calm that breathes around  Bids ev'ry fierce tumultuous passion cease  In still small accents whisp'ring from the ground  A grateful earnest of eternal peace  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd Muse  The
