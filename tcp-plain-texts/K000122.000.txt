 THE Bricklayer's POEM TO THE Countess of CHESTERFIELD On Her LADYSHIP'S saving the SOLDIERS from being shot  DUBLIN  Printed in the Year M DCC XLV  THE BRICKLAYER'S POEM TO THE Countess of CHESTERFIELD c  WHAT means this dismal Sound that March so slow  This solemn Sadness and this Pomp of Woe  Why hangs that Horror on the Soldier's Mien  Why droop the Multitude What means the Scene  Behold two Victims pale and trembling led  Already number'd with the mould'ring dead  What ghastly Terrors on each Brow we trace  See Death imprinted on each dying Face  Frail Nature bends beneath the pond'rous Woe  And prone to Death would fain prevent the Blow  Yet Love of Life asserts its eager Claim  But Hope alas affords no flatt'ring Gleam  Lo the pale King in horrid Pomp appears  What cruel Eye could then refrain from Tears  What Heart relentless then forbear to melt  Who saw their Sorrows but like Sorrows felt  How sad the Conflict how severe the Strife  Of Wretches clinging to the Verge of Life  When angry Justice claim'd her destin'd Prey  And frown'd vindictive on the kind Delay  Thy saving Mercy in that Moment flew  The darling Attribute of Heav'n and You  To soft Compassion won thy willing Lord  His Justice temp'ring sheath'd th' uplifted Sword  And in that fearful that tremendous Hour  Snatch'd the pale Victims from th' offended Pow'r  As when by adverse Stars or Chance misled  Entic'd by Lucre or pursu'd by Dread  A Wretch from some high Rock's stupendous Brow  Hangs o'er the Waves and dreadful Depths below  The slender Bough he grasps his only Stay  Yields to his Weight and more and more gives way  Of Hope abandon'd as the Branch he tears  He views th' Abyss and as he views despairs  'Till some unhop'd for Hand prevents his Doom  Lifts him to Life and lengthen'd Years to come  Redeem'd from Fate nor yet restor'd to Life  They wond'ring pause and feel a doubtful Strife  If still on Earth they breathe with human Race  Or mix with Shades in Death's obscure Embrace  'Till dawning Hope the dubious Horror clears  Confirms their Safety and dispels their Fears  Loud Shouts of Triumph waft Thy Name on high  And STANHOPE'S Goodness fills the vaulted Sky  Oh hadst Thou Pow'r afflicted Realms to spare  And rescue  Europe  from the Waste of War  Fell Rage and Discord at thy Nod should cease  And all Mankind enjoy the Sweets of Peace  Then human Blood should deluge Earth no more  But Leagues of Commerce stretch from Shore to Shore  You like the Dove the friendly Branch would bring  And blooming Olives in each climate spring  golden Age the guilty Globe shou'd see  And  Scotia  faithful as  Hibernia  be  No Feuds intestine in  her  Bosom jar  No Breath rebellious wakes the Trump of War  Her martial Tribe a loyal Fervour feels  And Virtue's Strength each manly Bosom steels  For Truth and Freedom firmly they unite  And stand resolv'd to tempt the hardy Fight  Thy STANHOPE'S Presence shall each Breast inspire  And GEORGE's Glory set their Souls on Fire  The END
