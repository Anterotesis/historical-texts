 CONSPIRACY A TRAGEDY  BY R JEPHSON ESQ  DUBLIN PRINTED BY GRAISBERRY CAMPBELL FOR JOHN ARCHER N  o  DAMESTREET    PROLOGUE  THIS night with dread unusual we appear  For this has been a very damning year  Establish'd fame perhaps in vain we bring  Since rigid justice is an awful thing  Awful and hateful human but in part  All frown an outside man without a heart  Such you may see in every street you pass  Just as like men in plaister stone or brass  Our early Prologues in less cautious times  Rail'd at the audience in permitted rhymes  Faults there might be they own'd but then wou'd swear  Of faults or beauties you no judges were  As peers by brother peers alone are tried  Poets alone on poets shou'd decide  With surly Ben this dogma first began  So in succession to pert Colley ran  John Dryden with a crab stick of harsh wit  Rejoiced to drub the Hydra of the pit  Tho' little then was right and much amiss  Not one of all the venom'd tongues durst hiss  On the tamed spirit of the cudgel'd town  Almanzor and mad Maximin went down  Now by inversion ten times more polite  The poet's always wrong the critic right  Nay some have found a more enlighten'd way  And boldly censure who ne'er saw the play  This mayn't perhaps be justice to the letter  To see is well but inspiration's better  Of old the vehicles of wit were scarce  Men judged upon the spot of play or farce  By no concocted spite the piece was torn  The short lived Virus died where it was born  No daily column then was gladly seen  By envy raised and scribled o'er by spleen  And sure if pleas'd or griev'd we little gain  By reasoning back the pleasure or the pain  Still safely we may trust the feeling part  But never set the head against the heart  For various causes you frequent the scene  Some to dispel but more to indulge the spleen  Some fly a dun and some a railing wise  And lose the real in fictitious life  A passive mistress many here pursue  But most we see have nothing else to do  Others prefer the days dull business done  To yawn in company than quite alone  Good harmless souls may no rude sounds molest 'em  Nor passions feign'd or real e'er infest 'em  In times not long gone by a noble peer  Unlike the sprightly race who now trip here  Four previous footmen his high state express  And gorgeous as a satrap was his dress  No household fowl on maple perch repos'd  As innocent of thought more sweetly dozed  Warm in his muff with periwig for cap  Here he indulged one discontinuous nap  Yates Woodward Cibber Garrick charm'd in vain  Kind Morpheus held him in his softer chain  Just as the curtain drop'd he heard it said  A well known slentor of the stage was dead  "I'm glad on't cries my lord and why do you think  "He roar'd so loud I cou'd not sleep one wink"  This night at times may kinder slumbers seize you  Sleep when we're dull and wake when we can please you  PROLOGUE  THO' he pretends no commerce with the skies  A perfect stranger to deep mysteries  Nor is astrologer enough to make  Predictions for a new year's Almanack  Yet for his play the poet sees with sorrow  And now foretells what all may see tomorrow  Tho' here where genuine sense with candour reigns  Fair approbation crown his tragic strains  For oft this favour'd muse has been before you  Always to thank but never to implore you  A hundred sterner critics still remain  To damn his labours and your taste arraign  In posts gazettes and chronicles they rage  And failing to adorn affright the stage  Turn to the usual column there you'll see  What those sage Delphic oracles decree  First for the fable "that's a flimzy tale  "With unsupported characters dull stale  "Not one generic or original  "The situations want dramatic art  "Such feeble patho's ne'er can touch the heart  "Next plainly does the plagiary appear  "This  Ha  is Richard and that  Oh  is Lear  The  Pshaws  and  Tuts  are Shakspeare Shakspeare clear  Yet why this rage to damn the thief on shore  Who eyes the labouring bark when tempests roar  And prays that rocks the vessel's ribs may break  Means his own gain in plundering the wreck  But tho' a thousand foundering poets split  None thrive and some must lose by shipwreck'd wit  Who steals your fame as Shakspeare said of yore  Enriches not himself but makes you poor  The Tartar when his comely foe lies slain  Hopes with his spoils his qualities to gain  Cou'd critics every excellence destroy  They nought inherit but the barbarous joy  Then of all censors none are so severe  As those whose scenes have been exploded here  Self rais'd to the tribunal seat of letters  As rogues made justices they try their betters  Unlike the Carthage queen the ills they bore  But indurate their callous bosoms more  Shou'd some pert teacher his own worth to enhance  Decry all rival brothers of the dance  Swear one was aukward t'other's manner coarse  Another hobbled like a founder'd horse  Say wou'd you not the envious railer blame  When once you knew Coupee himself was lame  Some merry idlers to the pen resort  And free from malice write at us in sport  Like the poor pelted frogs we cry out thus  "Alas 'tis play to you but death to us"  Yet shou'd some genuine critic point a fault  Our author's not too forward to be taught  To sage good counsel thankful he'll attend  And think who spares him least is most his friend  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Men

E  CONSPIRACY A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  Apartments of  VITELLIAVITELLIA SEXTUS  Vitellia  THOU dost but mock me Must I hear for ever  How great thy preparations while I know  How poor the deeds that follow What avails it  That thy deep practices with Lentulus  Inflamed his ardor that the fuel's laid  To wrap the towering capitol in fire  The appointed signal to begin the assault  On the unguarded Titus that our friends  On the right arm display a Tyrian scarf  Amidst the blaze and tumult to distinguish  The abettors of our boldnessthis dull tale  With nauseous iteration ten times boasted  Indignant I have heard Still my revenge  Preys on itself the tyrant lives to scorn me  Lives to usurp a throne by right Vitellia's  Nay worse to brave me by a public act  That gives my sceptre and his worthless hand  To Syrian Berenice  Sextus  Worthless hand  Then wherefore anxious how he give that hand  Why shou'd you wish it offer'd  Vitellia  To reject it  What can I plead for thee My own just rage  That burns unceasing in this boiling breast  At times seems heighten'd by thy fiercer flame  What will not Sextus dare at parting from me  Allegiance danger friendship melt before me  But when I fly with ready recompence  I find the promis'd service unperform'd  Some haggar'd fear arrests thy trembling arm  Phantoms and doubts and conscience shiver thee  How can I reconcile such contraries  Such ardor with such coldness  Sextus  I as well  Might bid the rapid whirlwind give me audience  For while intemperate choler  Vitellia  Now I'm calm  Now to thy casuistryif words have power  To reconcile a lover's faith and honour  With expectations rais'd but to be crush'd  With oaths dissolv'd even like the breath that form'd them  Thou art a rhetorician subtler far  Than he of Greece or our own smoothtongued Tully  Sextus  I know no art nor does this cause require it  If 'tis a crime to be irresolute  Where duty honour gratitude combine  To bid me not resolve I own the charge  Nay ought whate'er the forfeit glory in it  Cou'd I at once determine on this deed  Did no compunctious harrowings within  Print deep the prohibition on my soul  I were a monster madam not a Roman  Vitellia  A Roman no give o'er that empty boast  Shame of the unworthyOaths are bonds with Romans  Even at the altar of eternal Truth  The holy fane clasp'd by thy outstretch'd arms  I bound thee by such sacred ceremonies  When first I listen'd to thy wellfeign'd passion  Ne'er to divulge what to thy faith I trusted  And next tho' Stygian horrors compass'd it  To join my vengeance now to hear this sound  This windy vaunt "that Sextus is a Roman"  Sextus  Whatever be my country or my nature  One character I wear indelible  Thy fond thy faithful lover Oh Vitellia  The wavering of my soul too strongly proves  How fierce the storm that shakes me Yet alas  Like the tall pine when Caurus takes his top  While the sharp axe indents his trunk beneath  I struggle but to fall Say is it little  I can even think to perpetrate a crime  To late posterity must damn my fame  Blanch the dark records of past villainy  And make the name of Caesar's treacherous friend  Stand single in th' abhor'd preeminence  Vitellia  Then be the friend of Caesar from this hour  No more Vitellia's lover  Sextus  Ever ever  My fruitless turmoil in the fatal snare  But winds it closer round me Urged by thee  Treason seems justice dark assassination  Wears the bright robe of honourable vengeance  I know the infatuation of my soul  There is no crime of deepest ebon dye  My prompt obedience would not perpetrate  By thee arraign'd this gracious emperor  Seems to deserve the bloodiest tyrant's doom  But oh when I approach his matchless virtues  My fury turns to reverence awe and wonder  Vitellia  Brave when the danger's distantwhat more common  The courage of our peasantsBut go on  Sextus  Unjust Vitellia think ere you condemn  A heart so torn as mineyou steel my arm  To wreak your dire revenge the emperor  Demands my loyalty Thy offer'd hand  Impels on one side every tye of honour  Binds me to Titus All my love is thine  My duty his To thee when I return  Some new discover'd beauty fires my sense  While in the soul of Titus I admire  Some freshly blooming virtue Scorned by thee  Life were a burden yet to pay this price  Seals me a wretch for ever Powers of justice  Can she hear this and yet reproach her Sextus  Vitellia  Assure thyself of no reproach from me  Scorn and contempt are silent monitors  Sextus  Yet think ere one irrevocable stroke  Deprive the world of its first ornament  Rome of a father Nature of a friend  Revolve the heroic spirits of times past  See him unparallel'd  Vitellia  He has some virtues  But men like monsters only are without them  Nero reign'd five years wiselyBut my father  Was there an insult to sink degradation  From Pride's high pinnacle to ignominy  Unpractised on their emperor Hooted drag'd  The dagger at his throat by dungeon slaves  O'er their polluted pavements O just Ate  Appease his manes with luxuriant slaughter  Sextus  What justice can involve him in the charge  He not contrived nor countenanced the outrage  Vitellia  No but he profits by it That condemns him  Sextus  I know him form'd with every excellence  Brave pious merciful benevolent  Would he reward desert his coffers seem  Poor to his boundless liberality  Is he constrain'd to punish his sweet nature  Finds some soft palliative for every wretch  Green inexperience pleads the excuse for one  Grey hairs absolves another Every day  That passes o'er his head unmark'd by bounty  He calls a blank in life and strikes it off  As worthless to be number'd  Vitellia  Grant it all  Yet still he reigns  Sextus  He reigns 'tis true Vitellia  But all the cares of royalty are his  And all the blessings oursthe laurel wreath  The Imperial purple  Vitellia  Hear majestic Juno  And dost thou come with pomp of sounding words  The herald of my foe to trumpet forth  His irksome virtues sure thou hast forgot  This boasted pageant wears the diadem  His father tore from mine Say shou'd he not  Had he a monarch's sense of royal justice  Have shar'd that diadem his father ravish'd  With her who rightly own'd it  Sextus  Ah Vitellia  Is this the proof of hate the vizor falls  In vain its outside varnish wou'd display  The father's wrongs the daughter's piety  Reveal'd beneath the genuine face displays  The burning flush of angry jealousy  Vitellia  Jealousy  Sextus  Alas too plain  Vitellia  How jealousy  Sextus  And must this desperate hand  Vitellia  I'll hear no more  Here I absolve thee from thy worthless vows  Thus give them to the winds Soon shall I find  A braver arm to vindicate my cause  Sextus  I cannot bear these frowns  Vitellia  Away unhand me  Let Titus bleed and call Vitellia thine  To them  ANNIUS  Annius  Sextus the emperor seeks thee  Vitellia  Quick be gone  'Tis strange he can afford a moment's leisure  To any but his lovely Berenice  Annius  Madam he pays th' obedience he exacts  Governing himself he learns to rule the world  Within this hour by his especial order  The unwilling queen departed  Sextus  How  Vitellia  What say'st thou  Annius  Present I saw the tender separation  And scarce cou'd trust the fortitude I witness'd  Vitellia  My hopes revive  Aside  Sextus  O unexampled virtue  Vitellia  Wou'd I had seen it with what extacy  Cou'd I have heard the proud forsaken wretch  Reproach her faithless lover  Annius  Tears alone  Were her upbraidings Gently she withdrew  Convinced the tender soul of Titus suffer'd  More than her own by the constrain'd adieu  Vitellia  Her pride perhaps deceived her  Annius  No 'twas plain  Conflict preceded conquest But the senate  And Rome's repeated wish  Vitellia  The senate Rome  It is a kind of mockery to name them  Did they not flatter Nero Half the crimes  Of their mad emperors Rome's slaves engender'd  Her infancy was savage and unjust  Polish'd depravity her riper age  With every new refinement some new guilt  Even in her sports and pleasures barbarous  But now her rank maturity arrived  She soaks and fattens in gross infamy  If there were any righteous Jupiter  His thunder would proclaim him This vile city  This stew of sordid vice and luxury  Upturn'd from its foundations rent and crush'd  Would smoke in frightful piles a monument  That there were gods and Rome provok'd their vengeance  Apart to Vitellia  Sextus  The object of your hatred changes quickly  'Twas Titus now 'tis Rome I see the cause  Of this so sudden mutability  Vitellia  You see with jaundiced eye But mark me Sextus  Still apart  'Twere most unwise to prosecute our vengeance  Till the fresh gloss of this late specious act  Fades in the public eyeyou look mistrust  My will you have heardobey me or resign me  Exit Vitellia  Remain  ANNIUS  and  SEXTUS  Annius  Why droops my friend Why o'er thy labouring brow  Rides that black tempest while beneath thine eye  Glares wildly to the centre  Sextus  Annius Annius  I am a wretch whom Jove's almighty arm  Cou'd scarce pluck from perdition Let me warn thee  Give not unbounded empire o'er thy soul  To proud revengeful woman  Annius  Nay my friend  Sink not beneath the scorn of that coy beauty  Yet full orb'd charms like her's tho' past the bud  Strike deeper root in the young amorous heart  Than equal youth in its fresh primy bloom  Than Hebe or Janthe's orient softness  Sextus  Their smiles are goddesses but once inflamed  All good perverted to its opposite  Keen in the feeling of imagin'd wrongs  They know no ties all duties sink beneath them  Virtue and vice are shades to fade or glow  As their outrageous passions give them colour  Annius  I view them Sextus in a brighter mirror  A pure expanse unclouded and serene  Thy lovely sister's charms This day my friend  For fair Cornelia smiled her approbation  Knit close the ties of our dear amity  And gain the emperor's consent to join us  Sextus  He has heap'd his favours on me and I know  Sighing deeply  Unworthy as I am will meet my wish  United thus to thine with gracious ardor  May the soft powers who smile on nuptial bliss  Lucina Hymen and the Idalian love  Strew their unfading roses o'er your couch  And from the brightness of your mutual joy  Send one kind gleam to warm this chearless breast  Annius  Nay do not wound me with this deep dejection  Had Fortune thus conspired to make thee happy  I swear I wou'd have hush'd my own complaints  Nor let one inauspicious thought intrude  To cloud my gladness in a friend's contentment  Farewell I will precede thee to the emperor  And wait impatient till you crown my wishes  Sextus  Anon I'll follow thee Farewell one moment  Exit Annius  SEXTUS  alone  For see the fiery Lentulus appears  Indignant of restraint I know he comes  With furious zeal to chide my cold delay  And push me to destruction  To him  LENTULUS  Lent  Well encounter'd  All is disposed why then this dull suspense  Our eager friends like staunch hounds in the leash  Pant for the welcome signal to be loos'd  And snuff the destin'd quarry  Sextus  Are they then  So eager to embrue their ruthless fangs  In the rich blood of Titus are they weary  Unthinking fools to their own happiness  Blind to the blessings of his gentle reign  To heaven ungrateful do they wish to seat  A direr Nero in the imperial chair  And bow the knee to the remorseless brother  Lent  Of that hereafter No they wish to avoid  The fate of poor Alienus and Marcellus  Who with protracting councils like our own  Conspir'd against Vespasian and gave time  For this his son's preventive vigilance  To turn the destin'd slaughter on themselves  Sextus  O righteous doom of black conspiracy  Always abhor'd and rarely fortunate  The blood that issues from a monarch's wound  Ensanguines deep the sword which dares to shed it  What gain'd the noblest of conspirers Brutus  By Caesar's slaughter but to fall himself  By the same steel and dying to prophane  Substantial virtue as an empty shadow  Lent  He made half work he left a second Caesar  But like ripe corn beneath the sharpen'd scythe  Here the whole Flavian line shall down together  Sextus  O Rome preposterous Rome how many tyrants  Smear'd with the blood of your best citizens  Have in their palaces slept undisturb'd  And sunk in peace to execrated graves  While this great Paragon  Lent  For shame forbear  These thoughts should have preceded not crept after  Your bold concurrence in a perilous league  Like the vile rabble in our warlike triumphs  Disgracing the proud pomp they howling follow  Where were these thoughts when thy young ardour found me  Brooding o'er mutter'd threats and unshap'd mischief  Thy forward zeal bad me despise complaint  And Romanlike trust to my arm for vengeance  Sextus  Oh the more villain I and every tongue  Like thine should lash me with the memory  But you invert the charge Black was the hour  That knowing thee I shun'd notyou received me  While yet the embrio guilt but gasp'd within me  With quick preventive keen malignity  Lent  And sav'd thy puny blushes But no matter  With pride I wear the wreath pale fear casts from thee  Be it thine to praise him Sextus and betray  Mine to avow my anger and chastise  In thee it may be guilt in me 'tis justice  Sextus  The difference I doubt 'Tis your's to explain it  Lent  When the world's wonder Sion's haughty Temple  Smok'd on the ground an undistinguish'd ruin  Fast by his side I fought There he beheld  How this good arm scarce second to his own  Dealt death among his foes but when I ask'd  To rule the province I had help'd to conquer  He durst deny mewhat the reason think you  Because those outcasts of the peopled world  The scum and scorn of nations Jews vile Jews  Accused me of extortion in his absence  Sextus  Was that the cause O godlike emperor  How shall the breath of friendship raise thy name  When hate itself brings wreaths to thy renown  And points its accusation from thy virtue  Lent  Thou pale cold medler in a manly danger  Go with thy palsied conscience aspen traitor  Fall at the tyrant's foot reveal thy plot  But cast the blame on me or some brave Roman  Seduced by thy false tongue and now betray'd  Sextus  Rail onI have deserv'd it  Lent  Be a man  And what you durst contrive dare execute  The dull are unsuspicious This good emperor  Whom our prone senate have already godded  For reptiles can make gods is penetrable  By any gallant steel  Sextus  And know'st thou not  That she who set thee onI blush to name her  That beauteous mischief wou'd suspend the blow  Lent  Be thou the floating feather of her whim  Move or be still as her caprice ordains it  I shall plow on with my broad canvass spread  Too full to waver with a woman's breath  Tho' she indeed deserves a firmer sex  Woman in beauty but a bold she falcon  That masculinely soars on female pinions  Our Clelias Portias Arrias rise in her  Sextus  And canst thou do this deed  Lent  And canst thou ask it  I'm weary of this wrangling Freeze thou here  While I go send him to enjoy his godship  His apotheosis on earth is little  Above our heads throned near immortal Jove  With pity he'll look down on this dim earth  And thank me for his passport to the skies  Exit Lentulus  SEXTUS  alone  These are the bitter fruits of treachery  This thing of malice I myself have hatch'd  This viper of my treason with foul breath  Casts back the venom he imbibed from me  And stings while he obeys me Shame and ruin  I have step'd midway in the swelling tide  While the loud torrent thunders from above  Where'er I turn grim horror sits array'd  And shakes a dreadful dart I dare not pass  Nor can regain the shore Avenging Jove  Bare thy red arm chuse out thy hottest bolt  And headlong hurl me to the hell I merit  Exit  END OF FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Temple of Jupiter  TITUS  with Guards Lictors c  PUBLIUS  with several Senators and the Deputies of the subject Provinces bringing the accustomed Tribute  SEXTUS  and  ANNIUS  come forward from the opposite sides among the rest  LENTULUS  Publius  O FATHER of thy country thus the senate  With general voice salute their emperor  Nor ever did their awful rolls contain  A vote more just a title so deserv'd  Annius  O Titus not alone thy country's father  She deems thee more her guardian deity  As such decrees thee temples and hereafter  Means as a god to invoke thy sacred name  Publius  This annual tribute of the subject states  To that great work she dedicates and prays  Thy kind acceptance of the offer'd homage  Lent  Now the God speaks and now for oracles  Aside  But thy celestial panoply shall yield  To one good stroke from this poor mortal arm  Titus  Hear me ye Romans to deserve your love  Is the first wish that animates my breast  Let not that love exceed its modest bounds  To stain the emperor's cheek and yours with blushes  How wou'd the eternal movers of the world  Smile to behold my puny godhead shake  When the North's icy arrows search'd my breast  Or while my altars smoked with sacrifice  Shou'd fevers riot in my burning veins  To hear my prostrate deity implore  Some friendly hand to moisten my parch'd lip  To extend a little Tiber in a cup  And comfort immortality with water  Annius  Thus greatly to deserve and greater still  Decline the tribute of your subjects praise  Casts deeper shame on their preposterous zeal  Who lavish'd on imperial Tyranny  And monsters miscall'd men the praise of gods  Titus  I not reject the offerings of your love  But wou'd apply them to a worthier purpose  Vesuvius' late eruption has laid waste  Tremendous visitation the fair country  A prodigy reserv'd for this ill time  That loudly warns for some new expiation  The neighbouring cities lye one cumbrous mass  Of hideous ruin Whom the fiery wave  Spared to destroy pale Famine now devours  This gold may bring relief to misery  These be my temples thus be Titus worship'd  Publius  Such temples are indeed more durable  Than pyramids whose proud tops pierce the sky  No storm can shake them nor no time destroy  Their altars rise in every virtuous breast  And their rich incense is the o'erflowing heart  Titus  Enough enoughI would be private friends  Annius stay thou Approach come near my Sextus  Exeunt Publius and others  TITUS SEXTUS ANNIUS  Annius  Now Sextus warmly urge my dearest interest▪  Sextus  Ah Sir I dread to speakyour Berenice  Titus  Oh spare me spare me 'Twas a painful struggle  Rome and the emperor saw with different eyes  Rome that she was a stranger and a queen  And I her truth and beauty  Sextus  Yet she left you  Titus  Reluctantly alas as I endured it  The senate press'd me long to native nuptials  I interposed as long with feign'd delays  While one dear image mistress of my soul  In silent soft security reign'd there  To dictate all which caution seem'd to utter  Sextus  'Twas most unjust and cruel so to urge you  Titus  The chambers next to these were once the queen's  Nor eye nor foot but mine shall visit them  Since she forsakes them There I'll give my soul  Its burst of anguish there I'll hear her voice  There her enchanting form shall smile before me  In all her soft luxuriancy of beauty  The lute she touch'd the flowers her needle painted  Now mute or scatter'd as she cast them from her  Remind me of the dear delicious hours  When my enamour'd heart spoke out and own'd her  Thy master there will be no emperor  Sextus  Yet in the senate be an emperor  The name of queen we know is alien to them  Such is the force of rooted prejudice  Tho' in the imperial title they endure  More subjugation than Rome's seven kings  Had all been Tarquins cou'd impose upon them  They tremble at the shade but hug the substance  Titus  I rule their will but can't remove their error  Fatal to my repose or shade or substance  A prey to cankerous regret within  I strive against the feeling which consumes me  My reason disesteems my heart's desire  Condemns the choice and yet adores the object  Sextus  Thus princes are but subjects to opinion  Titus  New importunity each hour assails me  To fix the sceptre in the Flavian line  And with some daughter of Patrician blood  To share the imperial purple Warm esteem  Since Rome will have me wived with calmer fires  Must light the torch of Hymen This my Sextus  Pleads for thy sister most dear by that tie  And in herself unrival'd  Sextus  How my sister  Cornelia Sir  Titus  Cornelia  Annius  Dire election  Aside  Titus  Thou Annius bear my greetings to Cornelia  The senate have my promise ere the sun  Sunk in his western tent their new Augusta  Shou'd be proclaim'd So tell them of my choice  My heart can form no new engagement Sextus  To loose the bonds of friendship Names alone  The emperor and the subject must not weaken  Strict amity like ours  Sextus  Oh Sir consider  An humbler lot will suit my sister's fortune  Besides your bounties shower'd upon our house  Will fall in envious curses on my head  And sink my name but to exalt your error  Titus  Let Rome be envious not thy prince unjust  The friend adopted thus holds not his place  By the light tenure of the popular breath  But by my weigh'd selection  Sextus  'Tis too much  Stop this profusion of unbounded goodness  Unless you mean to swell the mighty debt  Beyond my power to thank you lest you turn  The feelings of a heart that knows its frailty  To undeserving and ingratitude  Titus  I cannot taste a rough unsocial joy  Nor trust me wou'd it stir my blood one jot  Tho' at my nod the necks of Rome shou'd bow  Like willows to the wind One good man's thanks  The warm effusions of a soul obliged  To me are more than all the pageantry  My heart partakes not tho' my power commands  Exeunt Titus and Sextus  ANNIUS  alone  Curs'd be my fortune curs'd the medling senate  That in the blindness of their busy zeal  Thus goad him to my ruin Slavish drones  That buzzing search their musty registers  To find some record of past turpitude  A sanction for the meditated shame  An earlier precedent of ignominy  Then dawb their volume with some worse disgrace  Some fouler stain of manhood's dignity  And call the enrollment sacredYet why curse them  Hence from my breast this selfish vile alloy  Debasing genuine passion Let her glory  Be now thy mistress Bow to that my soul  And worship her at distance Yet 'tis hard  To cast away affection like a garment  To tame young blood by cold necessity  And love for thy untutor'd fervency  To learn the icy lesson of respect  But see she comesOh never did my eyes  Behold her half so beauteous as this moment  A dear thing lost thus puts forth all its value  To him  CORNELIA  Cornelia  My Annius  Annius  Soft Cornelia 'tis a crime  To use endearments now  Cornelia  A crime amazement  Annius  Yes a most dangerous crime a new made crime  A crime within this hour no less than treason  Know thou art destin'd to ascend the throne  Of Rome's great masterCan I utter it  Thou art his choice the empress of Caesar  And would'st thou think it he to me assign'd  The barbarous task as such to greet thee for him  Going  Cornelia  The empress of Caesar which way wherefore  Annius  Because my destiny but toil'd to plague me  Because thy virtues beauty were too bright  To bless these humble armsfarewell for ever  I could but give a heart and he the world  Oh I shall grow disloyal if I gaze  And curse the man my duty bids me honour  Exit Annius  CORNELIA  alone  Me Caesar's empress Can that name alone  Turn oaths to air and melt the soul's affections  And can the generous TitusNo I wrong him  He knows not our engagements He's too good  Too gentle thus with tyrannous violence  Rudely to seize involuntary vows  And force by power what's due alone to love  Exit Cornelia  SCENE  An Apartment in the Palace  TITUS  meeting  PUBLIUS  who holds a Paper  Shouts heard  Titus  Whence this rude dissonance whose barbarous roar  Shakes to the centre these tall battlements  Publius  Loud as a stormy sea the people rush  Promiscuous to the temples and with shouts  Deaf'ning the sky implore the gods to guard you  Titus  Such clamorous prayers are impiety  They do instruct the gods and not adore them  There is more worship in one contrite sigh  Breath'd from the breast of humble penitence  Than in whole hecatombs and clouds of incence  If heaven will grant me length of days 'tis well  But the last blessing I should beg from heaven  Publius  'Tis the wan cast of transient melancholy  A momentary shade that comes and passes  Can make great Titus speak thus to his Romans  Titus  Survey man's little state thro' every age  And tell me wherefore shou'd we fear to change it  When children all our wishes gape at manhood  And that arriv'd we sigh to recollect  The lively blossom of our greener years  Swearing our school days were the happiest  Then frowns Ambition's strife and Disappointment  Or Friendship's brow estranged or luckless love  Unbless'd thus in the past or present hour  No centre fix'd for fleeting happiness  Old age creeps joyless on with envious step  Stealing us further from each sweet remembrance  Till all that minister'd our brief delight  Whether from pamper'd sense or flattering hope  Lies buried in that mouldering monument  Is that for my inspection  The paper held by Publius  Publius  It contains  The names of those rash citizens who dared  With calumny licentious to traduce  The fame of our great emperors before you  Titus  A barbarous register which nought avails  To the departed and administers  Unnumber'd wiles for treachery and fraud  To ensnare the living so henceforth remember  To pluck the root up of this dangerous evil  The informer not the accused shall meet my wrath  Publius  Yet Sir it is but just  Titus  Were justice urged  To rigor's iron verge the peopled earth  Would swarm with herds not men For who has found  In frail humanity the faultless monster  Guilt steels itself and hardens in society  Besides 'tis dangerous trust me to divulge  The world contains so little virtue Publius  Publius  But Sir there are who with foul breath will dare  Even to traduce your name  Titus  Why let them Publius  If Levity give breath to foul discourse  It matters not if Folly I lament it  If men complain with reason I shou'd thank them  And profit by reproof Does Malice blame me  I know my innocence and scorn the slander  To them  CORNELIA  My fair one my elect my lovely empress  Cornelia  Suspend a while that title Hear me first  A secret presses on this anxious breast  To you and only you I can discover  Titus  Publius farewell now freely speak Cornelia  Exit Publius  Cornelia  That you have deign'd from all the maids of Rome  To chuse Cornelia to partake your throne  O emperor I own the bright distinction  Deem'd worthy of thy choice my conscious soul  Rises in self esteem this prompts my tongue  To trust thy goodness to conceal no thought  Whose reservation might upbraid my weakness  With mean suspicion of thy matchless justice  Titus  Speak freely speak  Cornelia  First let me swear there lives not  Who more than I do venerates thy name  And owns thy wond'rous virtue Yet my heart  I fear to move your anger  Titus  Pray go on  Cornelia  It is not mine to give An early flame  Felt ere I knew to name it burn'd for Annius  If so you will accept my hand'tis yours  Titus  Perish so base a thought for once I see  Rare sight for kings the visage of bright truth  Unmask'd and genuine Thou hast nobly ventur'd  Even when it might offend the emperor  To show her undisguis'd My best Cornelia  How much am I thy debtor Cou'dst thou fear  I wou'd disturb your loves  Cornelia  bursting into tears  I knew you wou'd not  If lost in admiration of thy goodness  My words but poorly thank you O believe it  Too big for speech my swelling gratitude  Beggars the weak expression of my tongue  Most thankful when most silent  Titus  Dear Cornelia  Wou'dst thou indeed be grateful teach to others  Sincerity like thine Bid wholesome Truth  Coy visitant of courts return secure  Even in her homeliest garb she shall be welcome  More welcome than the practised harlot smiles  The ambush'd lie of guileful flattery  Soft are her blandishments the vizor fair  But underneathoh how unlike the varnish  Exit Titus  To  CORNELIA VITELLIA  Vitellia  May I without offence presume to offer  My early homage to my sovereign  May I adore that beauty whose bright beams  Thus shine superior with unrival'd radiance  And charm the soul of Titus Roman ladies  Tho' paragons before must humbly seek  Espousals in the senate must submit  To match with praetors or poor deputies  And leave the only Caesar for Cornelia  But  one  can be Augusta  Cornelia  Insolent  Aside  But let her be deceiv'd Such scorn deserves it  Farewell Vitellia  Going  Vitellia  This disdain becomes you  Once we at least were equal Time has been  Tho' now the giddy wheel's fantastic round  Has whirl'd thee highest that Rome's proudest she  Even Sextus' sister even the elect of Titus  Had statuelike stood still at my command  And blush'd obedience to the emperor's daughter  Cornelia  Enraptured with the sense of boundless joy  My transports might seem insultlet me fly  From that stern brow where smiles and love await me  Exit Cornelia  VITELLIA  alone  Must I endure it bear with tame submission  This contumelious superiority  With what disdain the haughty minion eyed me  May their false Hymen wave Alecto's torch  To scatter discord hate and barrenness  May furies yell around their nuptial couch  And Jove's red lightning in the embrace consume them  Yawn gaping hell ingulf them from my sight  To hide in Tartarus the bliss that blasts me  Tremble ingrate tremble at my rous'd fury  Thy blood this very hour  To her  SEXTUS  Sextus  I joy to meet thee  My sun but rises to renew that hope  And his sloped beam that dims the shadowy world  Takes nothing but thy beauty from my sight  To sadden his decline  Vitellia  Is Rome on fire  The capitol in ashes Where is Lentulus  Does Titus bleed say is the tyrant dead  Sextus  Suspension of the deed you last commanded  Vitellia  The deed suspended yet dar'st thou presume  Thus boldly to approach me thus to greet me  As if secure thy presence wou'd be welcome  Sextus  I heard no revocation of the order  Vitellia  Hast thou not heard the insult of this hour  Cruel unparalleled and dost thou wait  A signal less equivocal Oh fool  To take him for a lover who thus poorly  Can know my wrongs nor think they cry for vengeance  Sextus  Oh cou'd I find a single specious cause  To varnish o'er the act  Vitellia  A single cause  I'll give thee thousands One for ev'ry impulse  That can excite a noble mind to daring  Does freedom charm thee tear away the shackles  That clank at the degraded senate's heels  And rise the Brutus of these servile times  Does bright ambition fire thee open lies  The broad strait road to empire All my train  My friends my title to the imperial rule  All shall be thine Say can my hand my heart  Crown thy desires fly to the enterprise  Let me behold thee crimson'd in the blood  Of this perfidious to my arms I'll clasp thee  With fervor Juno like Is't not enough  Can'st thou still hesitate know then till now  I lov'd this TitusStill I may return  I dare not trust my heart again to love him  Now fly If thou can'st poorly shrink insensible  To all the charms of glory empire love  If thou can'st bear a rival who disputes  Usurps and violates Vitellia's heart  Thou art the last the meanest of mankind  Sextus  O thou hast found the way to rouse my fury  Love and a rival both shall justify  I feel thy rage infused Yes thou shalt see  Yon stately pile yon capitol in flames  This sword shall blush with rich imperial blood  My own runs back and curdles at the thought  Vitellia  Doubt but a moment and no more behold me  Sextus  Then vanish doubt And may thy scorn repay me  And aggravate my shame if I obey not  Exit Sextus  VITELLIA  alone  Yes Titus thou shalt feel me feel too late  The power of this despised rejected beauty  Too late shalt thou repent  To her  PUBLIUS  Publius  Princess your pardon  My tidings will I hope excuse the intrusion  For sure they should be welcome Thro' the palace  The emperor seeks you madam  Vitellia  Seeks me Publius  Not so not soWhy should he seek Vitellia  Publius  Can it be possible you know not why  To make you partner of his throne and greatness  Vitellia  What have I done that thou shou'd'st dare to mock me  Publius  To mock you lady by my life I swear  He bad me in his name salute you empress  Vitellia  Cornelia but this hour  Publius  This too I know  Cornelia has declined his offer'd hand  His faith was pledg'd and that's inviolable  By solemn deputation to the senate  This day to name his empress and th' election  Lights worthily on you Fear of Domitian  His successor in power tho' not in virtue  Shou'd our good Titus childless seek the skies  With ghastly hue makes pale the senate's cheek  Turns all the nectar of their bowls to gall  And sickens worse than surfeits  Vitellia  Oh distraction  Lose not a momentfly begone and find him  Publius  Whom madam  Vitellia  Sextus Oh thou loiterer  Publius  What message must I bear  Vitellia  Bid him return  On all the wings of wind return and meet me  Be speedy Publius to my chamber send him  For more than life hangs on each precious moment  Exeunt  END OF SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Palace  LENTULUS  with some  PLEBEIANS  Lentulus  YOU know your stations When the signal's rais'd  Conspicuous from my roof a lofty standard  With crimson banners floating fire the piles  Beneath the capitol then crowd the ways  And bar all access to extinguish them  Look well for me I shall approach to lead you  And give your thirsty swords their glut of slaughter  Shout as I cry and strike where I command you  Be resolute spare none and earn your drachmas  What humble virtue when a drachma bribes it  Exeunt  SEXTUS  with a crimson Scarf on his Arm  These fears are well these secret horrors tell me  I am but half a villain Every shadow  Each passing breath that rides th' invisible air  Swells to a terrible form and with shrill tongue  Appals me as I tread Rash Lentulus  Speeds to the capitol He but begins  The bloody business he rejoices in  And happier so than I am Cou'd I think  That I shou'd live to envy Lentulus  Then yet draw back thy foot Can love require  A sacrifice of blood and a friend's blood  Murder assassination no Vitellia  Thy rage and not thy nature prompted thee  Thy soul's a woman's and thy calmer thoughts  Will bless my disobedience Then prevent it  What do I see the capitol on fire  Already 'tis begun My curs'd remorse  May mourn too late but not prevent his doom  As he is rushing out Annius meets him  Annius  Where dost thou rush why this distemper'd haste  What means this wild distraction in thy looks  Sextus  No questions nowmy shame too soon will tell thee  Rushes out  ANNIUS  alone  What can this mean "My shame too soon will tell thee"  Shame finds no harbour in a breast like thine  The seat of truth and honour Yet his eyes  Glared wildly his cheek pale his trembling palm  Cold as the grasp of death Some strong convulsion  Too fierce for utterance or concealment shakes him  Oh what a mournful change in his kind temper  Gay as the ruddy morning which he met  Or the rous'd lark Hyperion's harbinger  Obvious to allNow gloomy sad retired  And shunning with mistrust even love that seeks him  Yet may the balm of friendship  To him  CORNELIA  Cornelia  O my Annius  Wake ev'ry sense to joy and gratitude  The antic fortune that with cruel sport  But mocks us with the approach of happiness  Weary at length gives o'er the unequal strife  And baffled owns our stronger destiny  Annius  I know it all thy matchless constancy  And flew to glad thy brother with the tidings  Cornelia  Yet art thou cold to the transporting bliss  Thy wandering eyes require some other object  The pressure of thy hand but feebly holds me  Nay now it bids me leave thee bids my tongue  For other ears reserve the ungrateful tale  Or wait thy better leisure to be welcome  Annius  I could for ever hear for ever hold thee  But now a dearer interest than my own  Dearer than all but thee must force me hence  A little moment in the account of time  But tedious hours in love's swift calendar  Must I be absent from thee  To them  PUBLIUS  with a Centurion  Publius  Noble Annius  I grieve to find thee thus At such a time  The capitol on fire all Rome alarmed  Wild consternation stalking through the streets  And dangers doubled by men's ignorance  Thus unconcerned to shun the public care  And loiter while thy country claims thy service  Annius  Ha then my friend's distraction when we parted  Aside  May have some fatal cause  Going  Cornelia  Stay Annius stay  Thou wilt not thus abandon me exposed  Defenceless to the tumult  Annius  For a moment  Good Publius guard her to thy care I trust  A dearer pledge than yon devouring flames  Tho' Rome's seven hills smoak'd from their hot embrace  And all their wealth was mine could ravish from me  Exit Annius  Remain  CORNELIA PUBLIUS  and a Centurion  Cornelia  But tell me Publius whence this accident  Publius  So may it prove Yet is there cause to fear  'Twas not the work of chance Some dark design  Untraced as yet to its pernicious source  Has spread these threat'ning fires Madam retire  And banish every fear This brave Centurion  Will guard your safety I must speed to find  The destin'd empress 'Twas the emperor's order  I should take care of both  Cornelia  Did Titus then  Think of our safety  Publius  He to all attends  Provides 'gainst all Had'st thou but seen the hero  Serene amidst confusion check the rash  Confirm the timorous with threats with praise  Quick to discern now urge and now restrain  You would have seen united in one man  The delegate of Jove Rome's sword and shield  The prince the friend the citizen the father  I must delay no longer Now 'tis safe  To lead you hence Valerius will conduct you  Clear from the capitol he knows the passage  Madam farewell I must attend the princess  Exit Publius Centurion conducts Cornelia  Enter  VITELLIA  looking about distractedly  My search is bootless some propitious ray  Direct me where to find him 'Tis in vain  Then let me fly and warn the emperor  Sextus 'tis he  To her  SEXTUS  with a bloody dagger  Sextus  In human yes behold him  Know thy own ensigns these distracted looks  These tottering knees this dagger dyed in blood  Now smile and gild these horrors if you can  Thy cruel mandate is too well obey'd  Vitellia  What do I hear  Sextus  Alas too sure Vitellia  Titus oh Gods pours forth his mighty soul  And throbs in death's last pangs  Vitellia  Dies by thy hand  Sextus  I did it not Struck with remorse too late  I strove to save him Ere I could arrive  A villain of the vile confederacy  Had pierced him from behind In vain I cried  "Hold monster hold" the fatal blow was sped  The assassin left his execrable steel  Deep in the wound and fled In haste I tried  To wrench it forth but with the reeking blade  The blood gush'd on my robe and oh dire fate  The hero closed his eyes and lifeless fell  Vitellia  Why am not I too dead Oh tis too much  Had the same hour that snatch'd his precious life  Seal'd these sad eyes in everlasting night  Had the same stroke transfix'd this throbbing heart  How had I bless'd the hour how clasp'd the wound  What endless misery had this breast escaped  Sextus  Pity and rage impell'd me to chastise  The impious murderer In vain I sought him  He has escaped my fury Fiends shall find him  No darkness can conceal it But oh Princess  What shades will cover Sextus Earth nor heaven  Will shelter or receive me Where's my peace  See what a price my desperate passion pays  To satisfy thy fury  Vitellia  True too true  I am a monster This inhuman breast  Might suckle tigers give to savage natures  More deadly fierceness Bloodstain'd as thou art  Thy soul is white as Alpine snow compared  With my deep guilt From this detested hour  Mankind like withering pestilence will shun me  I am the curse which yon mysterious heaven  Hangs o'er thy destin'd towers imperial Rome  Thy sun is set let darkness veil the earth  Portentous terrible the offended Gods  Tho' hoary Flamens choke their skies with incense  Ne'er cast one look to this devoted land  Abandoned o'er to man's enormity  This land of horror guilt and parricide  Sextus  Oh thou had'st wrongs to mitigate thy crime  But what had I I lost no throne by Titus  Tho' thousands sought and merited his favour  Still on my head the precious dew was shower'd  Honour and wealth thro' all the mighty empire  In copious streams flow'd from the will of Sextus  Cherish'd beloved and well have I repaid him  No father's shade like thine cou'd haunt my slumbers  To punish in the son the sire's offence  Yet villain I contrived  Vitellia  A father's shade  Oh speak no moreCan base hypocrisy  Affected reverence for a father's wrongs  Wash out the stains that purple all my soul  A father's wrongs a fury's jealousy  Revenge devised the tale and hell confirm'd it  I felt no touch of filial piety  Deluded man now be thy anger just  Why gleams that dagger idly in thy hand  It reeks with precious blood Here turn the point  One drop from that dear stream mix'd in my veins  At least will rise and plead in Heaven to spare me  Sextus  Wou'dst thou then doubly dye my hands in murder  To wash out blood by blood Unhappy princess  'Twere blessedness to die The righteous gods  Reserve us both for heavier punishment  Fruitless remorse and ever gnawing anguish  We must endure while mortal and hereafter  All hell will rouse to wake new torments for us  Vitellia  Give me my just preeminence in woe  Can friendship mourn like love Too long I feign'd  Struggled too long to hide the secret from thee  Deceived thee most when most I seem'd to hate him  Sextus  'Tis well 'tis well let me feel all my horror  Vitellia  The first strong passion of my soul was love  Its first dear object Titus Burst poor bosom  All my fond heart could wish my fancy form  Was heaven contriving for me At the moment  My fatal frenzy urged thee to the deed  I was proclaim'd his empress This curs'd day  Had seal'd him mine Be merciful and kill me  Take pity on me heaven it chokes devours me  'Tis insupportable O Titus Titus  Sextus  Is this the balm thou pour'st into my wounds  First raise the assassin's arm and then despise him  Tho' all the world should cast me forth with scorn  Abhor pursue me thou shou'dst stretch thy hand  And pour the balm of comfort o'er my anguish  Vitellia  What balm what comfort can Vitellia give thee  Ask it from roaring seas or burning Aetna  Their rage is calm as slumb'ring infancy  To the wild passion of this stormy breast  These hornet sounds already buzz around me  "An emperor might be spared but not a Titus  "The land just panting with recover'd breath  "Raw from the lash of gory tyranny  "A balmy prince healing and merciful  "Snatch'd from the bliss of sweet benevolence  "To satiate an Alecto's jealous fury"  Sextus  'Twas fear 'twas phantom when I urged his virtues  Vitellia  Oh let us meet no more Each time I view thee  Again I seem to urge he bleeds again  Thou wert too quick too ready to obey me  Wou'd I had found some dilatory slave  Insensible and cold He wou'd have sooth'd  Promis'd but not perform'd saved me from crimes  Heaven's mercy can't absolve nor hell can punish  Vitellia rushes out  SEXTUS  alone  All is accomplish'd I have pass'd the brink  Of every hope and fear Does ought remain  Is there a friend to trust and be betray'd  A mistress to impel my hand to murder  And then disclaim revile me and avoid  Ye thoughts that drive my whirling brain to madness  Ye vengeful furies that besiege my soul  I will not wait your tardy ministry  But leap the gulph and plunge at once to darkness  Going to slab himself Annius enters  Annius  Hold thy rash hand The emperor requires  Sextus  Requires my blood He shall be satisfied  Struggling  Annius  Requires to see thee  Sextus  Where in heaven to see me  No those bright portals are for ever bar'd  There throned with demigods the hero sits  Nor bends his glorious eyes to earth and me  But I am doom'd to tread the dreary realms  Where sad Cocytus rolls his sullen wave  Where Phlegeton boils o'er with livid fires  Where guilty ghosts shall hiss me from their haunts  And yelling furies through the gloom pursue me  Annius  Thy reason is disturb'd Rouse rouse for shame  Decline not thus thy drooping brow to earth  Why roll thy wandering eyes on vacant air  Shaping a hideous host of threat'ning forms  From the black coinage of distemper'd fancy  Sextus  Think'st thou these horrors are fantastical  I feel them here here is substantial hell  Here ever whirling wheels and gnawing vultures  Striking his breast  Annius  Come banish in the emperor's embrace  This gloomy brood of thickeyed melancholy  Now while the busy throng surround his throne  When even Indifference wears the face of zeal  And feels or feigns officious loyalty  He wonders much thou art not by his side  That thou cou'dst leave him in the hour of peril  Sextus  That I cou'd leave him how is he not slain  Annius  Forbid it heaven No he returns unhurt  Safe from the wild commotion  Sextus  Can it be  Are my eyes false Sure I beheld him fall  Pierc'd by the assassin's dagger  Annius  Where beheld him  Sextus  In the frequented pass that leads from hence  To the Flaminian  Annius  Then thy eyes deceived thee  Some other in the throng and wild confusion  Thy sight mistook for Titus  Sextus  How some other  Say who cou'd dare to assume the imperial robe  The sacred laurel and the sovereign ensigns  Worn by the emperor only  Annius  Nay I know not  But Titus lives praise to kind heaven unhurt  I left him but this moment and to seek thee  Sextus  Did I hear right All gracious Jove I thank thee  Falling on his knees  Sound it to lands remote to air and skies  Transporting word again again repeat it  Hush'd be the winds no accent breathe but this  O muchloved prince Unfold thy arms receive me  Thou ever kind and welcome now more dear  Than all the blessings love cou'd shower upon me  Running into his arms  Teach me to bear this joy Thou dost not mock me  Annius  What still incredulous convince thyself  Trust thy own sense and see if I deceive thee  This moment come before him  Sextus  Come before him  Shew him the vile perfidious who betray'd him  Annius  AmazementThou  Sextus  Yes I 'Twas I betray'd him  I the prime mover of the foul sedition  The master daemon I Go get thee from me  Contagion strikes from my infectious touch  My breath will blast thee  Annius  I am lost in wonder  Thou Sextus thou betray the emperor  Sextus  Ask me no more Spare the reiteration  One fatal moment Annius has undone me  Farewell a long a last adieu to Rome  Think sometimes of thy friend not what he is  But what he was and if his crimes will rise  To blot the kind remembrance oh forget not  These bitter tears that scald his burning cheek  How sharp his sufferings how sincere his sorrow  Annius  This is indeed a dreadful cause for sorrow  Sextus  Ay is it not for never ceasing sorrow  Farewell once more I go for ever from thee  To mourn and hide my guilt in solitude  To fall by my own hand were cowardice  May every God who sees my deep remorse  Guard him whom I no more must dare to name  Thou Annius with thy courage and thy faith  'Gainst foreign danger and domestic treason  By day by night in peace in war defend him  Defend him from the inconstancy of Rome  But most defend him from his treacherous friends  Annius  Another time explain this mystery  Now let me think The plot is yet unknown  The flames 'tis thought were spread by accident  But thy precipitate flight unhappy friend  Will six on thee the stain  Sextus  What canst thou counsel  Annius  Do not withdraw but keep the secret close  Attend the emperorthink all pass'd a dream  When dusky spirits ruled the unwholesome air  And from their vaprous pinions dipt in Styx  Shook phantoms round thy head  Sextus  The wounded wretch  Whoe'er he was that fell beneath the stroke  Ere this perhaps has given me up to shame  Annius  I'll to the place where you beheld him fall  Examine who he was and bring thee tidings  Of all that may concern thy life or safety  Before the breast of Titus can admit  Suspicion of thy faith there will be time  To apprise thee of the danger Then withdraw  Uncertain is the peril if you stay  But certain if you fly  Sextus  My scatter'd sense  Scarce comprehends thy reason tho' my heart  Acknowledges the kindness Guide me Annius  I go since you advise itBut these cheeks  Stript of their wholesome hue these haggard eyes  Loud as the herald's throat will publish me  Annius  The least delay may bring destruction now  Sextus  I go this bloody mantle will betray me  Annius  Whence is that blood  Sextus  It spouted from the veins  Of the unhappy man I mourned for Titus  Annius  Hide it with strictest care from every eye  Hold as we pass we may exchange our robes  I will take thine these crimson drops wash'd out  My chamber's near I'll meet thee with the emperor  The presence of a friend may bring thee comfort  Sextus  'Tis all I have leftwilt thou still call me friend  As just awaken'd from a hideous trance  The dreadful phantoms still encompass me  I tread with fear and doubting every step  Am lost in the delirium  Annius  Oh be gone  END OF THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  An Apartment in the Palace  TITUS CORNELIA  Titus  CONSPIRE against my life said you not so  Cornelia  Hoping my intercession might prevail  To obtain his pardon from your clemency  One of the traitors made confession full  The man you know and like the chief he follow'd  A worthless object of your frequent bounty  Yet to be prais'd in this  Titus  Then Lentulus  Is guilty That bad man unfit for trust  Check'd by my power in his rapacity  Wou'd wipe the memory out of past offence  But by transgressing deeper In the account  Of foes like him I count my own desert  His enmity's a laurel But what further  Cornelia  Lentulus the impious Lentulus  Devised the enterprise with mad design  To wrest Rome's sceptre from thy sacred hand  He sired the capitol to raise the tumult  And in the imperial robe and wreath expected  The giddy crowd for ever fond of change  And ever for the worst shou'd shout him up  A sovereign for his plumage But the robe  How just is heaven assumed for thy perdition  Assured his own One of the desperate band  Mistaking the impostor for the prince  Drench'd in the blood of Lentulus his steel  Deceived but by that garment  Titus  Is he dead  Cornelia  Of that I'm yet to learn  Titus  Methinks 'tis strange  They cou'd so long conceal the bold design  Cornelia  Oh generous prince thou art not yet secure  Treason is round thee See this crimson badge  A riband such as this binds up the robe  O'er the right arm of every daring villain  Shewing a riband  Observe it and be cautious  Titus  My fair friend  These are the joys of empire Judge me Truth  Have I not held my people's happiness  Much dearer than my own yet all my cares  Are sown in barrenness or shoot rank weeds  Choking the soil that nurs'd them From my brow  One desperate hand wou'd tear this hardearn'd wreath  To wear it on his own and still more strange  He finds abettors Can it be in Rome  Does Rome then hate thee Titus  Cornelia  Think not so  Think it a monster which the matron Rome  'Gainst Nature's course shook in convulsions forth  Which when the startled parent found to swell  With venom dangerous to her proper life  With her own hands she strangled  Titus  Heavenly Synod  You know if I have serv'd her You beheld  When on the banks of Ister or of Nile  Patient I felt the changing season's rage  Or scorch'd in sultry Syria for her glory  For her indulgence cruel to myself  I stifled my affections banish'd from me  The first dear object of a mutual passion  And thus my tears will fall ingrateful Rome  Even thus am I requited  Cornelia  Never yet  Was man so vile or enterprize so wild  Scorn'd or detested by the general sense  As to want followers from vice or folly  Tho' hopeless still the issue  To them  SEXTUS  Sextus  Oh that face  I dare not look upon it  Titus  Sextus welcome  How oft have we reproved our satyrists  For dark'ning Nature with black characters  Impress'd but by their spleen nor could believe  The principles of ill so widely sown  In human bosoms to give countenance  For such irreverence 'gainst our common parent  But farewell now fond plausibility  Our milkiness be henceforth turn'd to gall  For wou'd'st thou think it Titus is betray'd  Sextus  Alas too well I know it  Aside  Titus  Wou'd'st thou think  Titus is Rome's abhorrence Thou canst tell  For thou hast visited my inmost soul  Have I deserv'd to be abhor'd by Rome  Sextus  Abhor'd  Titus  Nay tell me friend  Sextus  I cannot speak  Titus  Thy tears speak for thee Come to my embrace  Why this is retribution these console me  Such tender proofs of thy unshaken faith  For Rome's ingratitude  Sextus  I cannot bear it  Aside  My silence is a second treachery  To them  VITELLIA  Vitellia  Ha Sextus here then all is secret yet  Aside  Sextus  I will shake off this load  Aside  Vitellia  Victorious Caesar  Advancing  The gods still guard thee this auspicious hour  Thy country 'midst her happiest registers  Shall keep enroll'd for ever Our glad altars  When the revolving sun renews this day  Smoke with rich incense and large hecatombs  Attesting thee preserv'd and heaven propitious  Titus  Thanks for this pious wish yet trust me princess  Nor life nor empire do I prize so high  To think them worth a struggle for themselves  Let heaven reclaim my life and Rome her empire  Thankful for their short date I will resign them  But go my Sextus in the emperor's name  Send to their homes the astonish'd citizens  Tell them the danger's past and thank their love  That made my safety their peculiar care  When peril was to all as imminent  That done return A grateful labour Sextus  Bears its own thanks  Sextus  Oh Janus what an office  Aside  Exit Sextus  At the opposite door enter  ANNIUS  in the robe of  SEXTUS  Annius  Order resumes its place the flames are quell'd  But wou'd our gilded palaces had choked  Their masters with their ashes ere the shame  Of spreading them to catch the life of Titus  Had stain'd our annals Therefore Sir take heed  There are who seek thy death  Titus  Too plain I see it  I read it with broad eyes yet still my heart  Combats the witness and wou'd fain disprove  The palpable conviction of their sense  While you like an ambiguous sorcerer  Shew me at once my fate and warn against it  'Tis past all doubtCornelia look behold  The very badge the traitorous ensign see  Hangs on the arm of Annius  Cornelia  Ha it blinds me  Titus  Too plain too plain The very form the colour  Vitellia  He in our league I have destroyed him too  Aside  Cornelia  Traitor  Annius  Amazement and from thee Cornelia  Titus  And wou'd'st thou shed my blood my son my Annius  Annius  Sooner let furies seize or lightning blast me  Titus  Dissembling now is vain That crimson flag  That blushing symbol is the kindred badge  Of perfidy and murder  The riband on the robe of Annius  Annius  This what's this  You make me wonder By my soul I swear  I know of no device this silk contains  Vitellia  Distraction comes for thought O pitying powers  Aside  Suggest some lucky artifice to save him  Annius  But Sir forgive my honest indignation  My conscious innocence assumes the licence  Had any tonguebut thinethus dared to accuse me  I shou'd not tamely stand to expostulate  Nor put my well tried truth on affirmation  But my quick sword had started from my side  And stab'd the lie in the foul slanderer's throat  Titus  The injured must complain nor wou'd I check  A decent freedom in the meanest tongue  Such passion shou'd have praise with honesty  Yet think not loudness can outorganize  The silent crimination of that silk  Why dost thou wear it  Annius  Wear it Sir this silk  Unhappy friend No Sextus I will spare thee  Aside  Vitellia  Oh that the earth wou'd yawn and swallow me  Aside  Titus  'Tis manifest Guilt chokes his utterance  Vitellia  Heart heart be still Thy throbbing will betray me  Aside  Titus  Cornelia pity me All men but me  Make friends by bounties When I pray the Gods  I must not pray against mine enemies  Who meet me in the glittering files of war  But that the bosom of the friend I cherish  And strain to mine may not hide daggers 'gainst me  That every benefit my hand confers  By transformation most unnatural  Become not like the ooze of ebbing Nile  A bed to engender asps and crocodiles  Cornelia  Medusa's sever'd head that brew'd a pest  With every drop that fell produced no fang  No viper keen as this ingratitude  Titus  May thunder strike me if I wou'd not rather  Had I unnumber'd lives at once resign them  Than hold one fitful feverish being thus  With such vile thoughts and such detested caution  Vitellia  Oh for an age of bliss I'd not endure  Aside  The hell of this distraction in my bosom  Titus  Now own the improvidence of persidy  If trifles make men jealous oftener still  Trifles betray the deep concerted wile  With all black powers of night evoked to hide it  Behold him there the lover for whose arms  Thy constancy refused Rome's diadem  Cornelia  Oh add not to my sorrow On this cheek  Deep glows the unextinguishable shame  Which that proud front still bold and unabash'd  Tho' native to his crime disdains to wear  Titus  Yet answer me say most ungrateful man  How could thy bosom harbour the foul thought  To murder him who loved thee Answer me  Annius  Appearances condemn me Let your wisdom  Against this fluttering frivolous levity  the riband  Weigh the whole tenor of my life my truth  Protested strongly this encreasing wonder  That almost strangles utterance then determine  Which scale preponderates  Titus  So may it prove  Publius I grieve to see his conscious pangs  My presence doubles his distress and shame  See him secured and straight instruct the senate  To examine his design and find its source  I leave thee to thy heart a keener monitor  Than my reproaches which henceforth I spare thee  Proportion but thy sorrow to thy sin  And life will prove thy heaviest punishment  Exit Titus Publius signs to an Officer who puts chains on Annius and exit  Remain  ANNIUS VITELLIA  and  CORNELIA  Annius  All is not lost thou ever kind and gentle  My rest my harbour from the storms of fate  My tempest beaten bosom flies to thee  And longs to be enfolded by thy softness  What means this scorn  Cornelia  Away and come not near me  Unless thou mean'st still deeper to impress  My rooted detestation Witness Dian  Had fortune emptied her whole quiver on thee  Stript thee of wealth and honours chang'd thy form  Thus goodly as it is to loathsome foulness  My constancy had triumph'd o'er her malice  And woes on woes had more endear'd thee to me  But now to love thee treacherous base ungrateful  Were to forget myself renounce my honour  And make me share the persidy I scorn  Exit Cornelia  ANNIUS VITELLIA  Annius  Yet innocent I will abide it all  Princess you gaze as I were dangerous  Yet seeming not reality confounds me  As from the eclipse of black surrounding clouds  The sun's effulgence breaks with double lustre  So shall my truth cast off this veil of shame  And shine more bright from base obscurity  Vitellia  O rank not me with those obdurate hearts  Which always frail and often hypocrite  Less adverse to the crime than the detection  Wou'd sharpen hard affliction's keenest pang  As they were charter'd against mortal frailty  I have a thousand things to say to thee  I staid not to upbraid but give thee comfort  Know Annius  To them  SEXTUS  entering  Sextus  Bear me whirlwinds to his feet  Hold on your livesOff with these shameful bonds  Shall truth and honour walk thus manacled  While treason roams at large That robe was mine  The guilt is mine Be quick ye tardy slaves  Fix your vile fetters here  Vitellia  Be patient Sextus  He heeds me not These have no power to free him  Officer  My lord the consuls send to summon us  To the assembled senate  Annius  Lead me to them  Thou see'st what I endure Push'd to the brink  I kept thy fatal secret If 'tis possible  Save thy own life but O preserve my honour  Exit Annius guarded  Remain  SEXTUS VITELLIA  Sextus  Off let me pass  To Vitellia who holds him  Vitellia  Yet hold a little moment  Sextus  Is't not enough What not yet satisfied  Vitellia  Oh do not waste these precious hours in strife  But fly this moment and by flight preserve  Thy life and poor Vitellia's  Sextus  How by flight  And leave my guiltless friend exposed to ruin  Vitellia  I will preserve thy friend Frame thou the form  Of any solemn oath be heaven and hell  Attested for its sanction bind me down  To pains on earth to Tartarus hereafter  Write it in blood my own blood boiling blood  May my remaining hours be more accurs'd  The pangs more sharp than those I suffer now  May I be still more wretched  Sextus  No I stir not  While the rais'd sword hangs threatning o'er his head  What leave him in this dire extremity  The forfeit of my crime  Vitellia  How shall I swear  By heaven by all my hopes I will preserve him  Sextus  But what avails my flight  Vitellia  Is that a question  My honour and thy life are both secure  Discovery must destroy thee and my secret  Becomes as public as the capitol  Sextus  No fear not By my life and all things sacred  Here shall it rest deep buried in my bosom  To death I will conceal it  Vitellia  I cou'd trust thee  If less thy love to Titus 'Gainst his rigour  Thy courage wou'd sustain thee But his mercy  His gentleness and friendship must subdue  And melt thy soul to weakness Hear oh hear me  By the dear memory of the first soft hours  That charm'd thy soul to fondness by our loves  By all thy hopes hold dear I beg thee fly  Confirm my fluttering heart I owe thee much  O make me more thy debtor 'tis the boon  The mightiest thy affection can bestow  Or mine accept It gives me peace and honour  See on my knees I supplicate Oh Sextus  Kneels  Let me prevailcan'st thou behold me thus  See these uplifted hands these streaming eyes  Sextus  Wou'd we had never met our destinies  Raising her  Had slept divided centuries asunder  But fate ordain'd us dreadful instruments  To toil together in one Stygian web  And in the texture weave our own destruction  Vitellia  Oh impotence of wishes what avail they  The child the dotard's waste of hours unpriz'd  Who was e'er wise or happy for a wish  Will they recall time past secure my honour  Seal up the senate's ears or break thy fall  When the grim lictor drags thee to the rock  Thy mildest doom to hurl thee down for ever  Sextus  Thy counsels have been ever fatal to me  And shall I trust them now My deafen'd ears  Still ring with thy reproach thy love avow'd  Even for the man you rais'd my arm to murder  Vitellia  These were the rash effusions of despair  The last I e'er shall utter From this hour  Let peace and gentleness unite our hearts  Sorrow and shame have so subdued me since  Scarce have I power enough to ask forgiveness  Yet listen to my suit Thy soften'd eyes  Beam sweet compliance Yes thou dost consent  I read it in thy looks thy soft'ning brow  Turn not away say do my hopes deceive me  With my heart's wings spread over thee I wait  Pity my anguish Speak oh speak and ease me  Sextus  I can forgive my wrongs and mourn thy sorrow  I wou'd obey thee too but my poor friend  My generous Annius he forbids my flight  Bids me sustain a thousand lingering deaths  Rather than poorly fly and let him perish  Vitellia  Inexorable still then take thy fate  My fears were most for thee I have a heart  Can give bold counsel in extremity  A hand can execute And each resolv'd  This dagger ends our strife  Draws a dagger  Sextus  For pity hold  Depend upon my faithagain I swear  No torture from my breast shall wring the secret  To them  PUBLIUS  with a guard  Publius  I grieve at the sad office but my duty  Requires that I demand that dangerous sword  Sextus  Why dost thou ask it  Publius  Know unhappy man  Fierce Lentulus still lives You guess the rest  Vitellia  Oh death to all my hopes  Aside  Sextus  The toils are round me  Seest thou Vitellia  Publius  I must lead thee hence  Already are the senators assembled  To sentence or acquit thee 'Tis my charge  To bring thee to the trial With reluctance  Unfelt before must I fulfill the office  Follow me this way  Exit Publius  VITELLIA SEXTUS  Vitellia  Thou self sacrificed  A moment might have saved thee Now 'tis pass'd  Farewell this one embrace 'tis all I have left  For the vast ruin I have brought down on thee  Sextus  O if prolong'd 'twou'd make death smile Vitellia  Once I had fame and honour both are lost  And 'tis but sit my life shou'd follow them  Exit guarded  VITELLIA  alone  Oh most compleatly wretched swallow'd quick  All the proud structure of my towering hopes  Love glory empire to the centre sink  And leave me whelm'd in infamy and horror  Hark the invenomed whisper spreads around  My shame becomes the tale of babbling Rome  Lo Sextus drags me to the bloody bar  And awful Titus by my rage devoted  Mounts his tribunal and to death consigns me  Then since thy frantic jealousy cou'd rise  To mock at danger and to spurn all laws  Let one bold frenzy soar a nobler height  Cut short the specious forms of tardy justice  And satiate hell with voluntary blood  Exit  END OF FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  Apartment of  VITELLIA  VITELLIA  alone  NO rest for the unhappy Sleep forsakes me  What a

forbode the worstNay dry thine eyes  Despair in this is bless'd 'tis the dead calm  Of misery's consummationZanthia speak  Zanthia  Forgive my tears the awful spectacle  Still shakes my very soulThink you beheld  The populous city pour forth all its swarms  To cluster in the forum The robed fathers  As if they sat not judges of the crime  But pale and anxious were themselves arraign'd  Even breathing seem'd suppress'd by expectation  And every eyeball shot beyond its sphere  Vitellia  Shall I hear more or bid thee spare the rest  My boasted resolution dies within me  And like an untrain'd soldier ere the sight  Shrinks at the distant sounding of the charge  But tell me allI wish yet dread to hear thee  Zanthia  Soon was the unhappy youth mournful abash'd  Remorse not fear stamp'd on his gracious visage  His pale cheek resting on his iron chain  Led forth to judgment while his stern accuser  With eyes all fire tho' feeble from his wound  Flung heavy treasons on him  Vitellia  Oh that tyger  Rash incapacity yet driving ever  The wiser who shou'd guide him to their ruin  Name him no morebut Sextus  Zanthia  Meek and sad  He neither strove to palliate or deny  But earnest beg'd as all the guilt was his  He only he might 'bide the punishment  Vitellia  O ancient honour O true Roman heart  Worthy thy firm forefather Regulus  Speak on speak on let every word you utter  Strike daggers here and frustrate this my hand  Resolved to give him justice  Zanthia  When the consul  With faltering voice pronounced his dreadful doom  Vitellia  Be brief and tell me what  Zanthia  Most horrible  My blood runs cold to name it On the Arena  By ravenous lions to be torn alive  Vitellia  Barbarians monsters why revile the senate  They sentence but the crime I made him guilty  Hast thou more torture for me  Zanthia  Thus condemn'd  A general groan as if the mingled throng  Had but one breast shook all the spacious dome  In copious streams tears gush'd from every eye  He only unappall'd with modest grace  In reverent silence bow'd to own their justice  The assembly rising his attendant guard  Led him to Caesar who has since confirmed  The sentence of the fathers and this hour  Illfated Sextus dies  Vitellia  Led him to Caesar  Then Hope's last ray is quench'd my shame reveal'd  His fate inevitable Bastard conscience  That dreading the detection urged the deed  Repentance for a childenough retire  Zanthia  Pardon your faithful slave I dare not leave you  There is a deadly fixture in your eye  Bespeaks some fatal purpose  Vitellia  Yes most fatal  And all

following  Cornelia  Support me save me Oh eternal powers  What have my eyes beheld  Annius  Heart thou art stone  Else thou wou'd'st burst at this  Cornelia  Is this their love  O thou vile city that but yesterday  Cast forth thy tribes to shout him to the sky  Deaf'ning the ears of Jove now to the Circus  To see him mangled his poor heart torn out  They fly as volleying sires pursued their speed  Nor cast one look behind  Annius  His blood this hour  Will glut their savage curiosity  The surly keepers by the senate's order  From the gaunt lions hold their wonted food  To whet their fierceness for the barbarous meal  I saw their glaring eyes heard the deep growl  Portentous of the carnage they expected  Cornelia  I am most miserible My exulting heart  Beat high with joy to find thee innocent  But oh I little thought a husband's honour  Cou'd be redeem'd but by a brother's death  Is no way left to save him  Annius  None but one  And that he has rejected I was present  A weeping witness of the interview  Soften'd almost to tears the gracious prince  By the dear memory of their early friendship  By duty faith and gratitude adjured him  To make a full confession of the cause  Which wrought him to the attempt By such compliance  Deep in oblivion to entomb offence  And give him back the wonted place he held  First in his soul's affection  Cornelia  Cou'd my brother  Hear it unmoved  Annius  Oh no his streaming eyes  His breast convuls'd with passion deep fetch'd groans  Proclaim'd th' unutterable agony  Prostrate to earth he fell avow'd his crime  And in the frantic vehemence of grief  Call'd blessings on his injured master's head  And curses on his own But to reveal  The cause of his revolt nor threats nor prayers  Favor nor life nor fear of death could move him  Cornelia  Then what remains for me I vainly hoped  A sister's tears might move him From our infancy  The tenderest union twined our hearts in love  Like blossoms from one parent stock we grow  Put forth the opening buds of youth together  And both at once must wither Oh believe it  So dear so vital is my fondness for him  To save my brother's blood I'd meet pale death  And clasp him like a bridegroom My next hope  Was in the emperor's pity he alas  Forbids my intercession  Annius  Never saw I  Passion so shake him His last wrathful words  I hear their thunder still "hence to thy doom  "Unnatural were thy deeds thy end be dreadful"  Cornelia  I rack my thoughts in vain Yet oh I know  Were he not bound by some delusive tie  Of spurious honour to this fatal silence  His soul wou'd yield to friendship's sympathy  Nor hide this secret canker which within  Consumes his life in silence  Annius  Thine too with it  But when were crimes confined in consequence  Yet leave me nought untried Go seek the emperor  Again embrace his knees shew thy sad eyes  There is in woman's tears a melting power  Man's nature can't attain nor man resist  Perhaps he may relent  Cornelia  He must he shall  God of persuasion with prevailing sounds  Endue thy suppliant's tongue such as may wrest  The brandish'd bolt from this imperial Jove  Quench the red lightning of his terrible eye  And for the fiery shaft of ruthless ire  Infuse sweet peace and melting clemency  Exeunt  SCENE  The Circus  TITUS PUBLIUS  Senators Lictors Guards c  LENTULUS  and other Conspirators in Chains at the bottom of

to at your feet behold  Titus  Cornelia rise Think not the soul of Caesar  Keeps one unshaken tenor while thy breast  Is heav'd with anguish or that thick rib'd ice  Surrounds a heart cold and insensible  Not to be thaw'd but by the melting power  Of drops from woman's eyes  Cornelia  Oh for my brother  Let my tears stream for ever the cold ground  Be channel'd by my knees no accent heard  But my perpetual prayer  Titus  A soundless voice  Beyond the tongues of Rome's best orators  Gesture or Hybla periods here within  Pleads for him deep so trust me all offence  'Gainst Titus is absolv'd  Cornelia  Why then with all  Is he absolv'd for you and only you  Has he offended  Titus  With the emperor  The abstract of Rome's state and majesty  Who chiefly stands responsive for her weal  Some commutation must be made for mercy  Improvident to leave a noxious spring  To burst out on the general health unsearch'd  Would ill become my prudence or my fanctions  Observe him pray be silent  Sextus brought forward by Publius  Cornelia  For a moment  But for a little momentOh my brother  Seize now the trembling crisis of thy fate  Cast from thy soul this obstinate disease  This vice of honour shameful in the extreme  Oaths with the wicked in themselves are void  What's holy made unholy heaven adjur'd  Against itself It cannot be in reason  In virtue lessdisclaim it oh disclaim it  Or reprobate at once both truth and wisdom  Titus  Once more we meet The senate have condemn'd thee  To a sore punishment Rome's peace disturb'd  Offended majesty the laws infringed  Friendship betray'd Both earth and heaven cry out  For justice on thee  Sextus  Both shall be appeas'd  Make my dire sentence still more horrible  Oh had I lives unnumber'd as thy virtues  And all paid down how poor the expiation  Titus  Then hear my last award Publius go thou  Pronounce to Lentulus and his followers  Forgiveness life and freedom Romans mark  I know I pardon and forget their crimes  Cornelia  How my heart throbs O Gods look down on Sextus  Titus  I would not mix thee with the common herd  To Sextus  The subjects of the state not Caesar's friends  But wishing to restore thee to my heart  Wou'd make thee worthy of it  Sextus  That vast treasure  Lost in a sea of guilt and sunk for ever  No more must call me master  Titus  One condition  So oft proposed even now accept from Titus  And if in all our days of life to come  One semblance of enstrangement from my brow  Reprove thee by its coldness call me loudly  Vindictive baseascribe the good I mean thee  Not to my kindness but my fear to punish  Sextus  New torture new distraction how determine  Aside  My silence will offend the generous prince  And if I speak I must destroy Vitellia  Titus  Have you a care more instant than your life  Have you a bond more sacred than your duty  Have you a friend more cordial than your prince  What no reply Is then my pity for thee  Not worth the stooping for take heed rash man  Wake not again my anger  Cornelia  Sextus brother  Pull not the unwilling thunder on thy head  But stop it yet suspended  Sextus  Extrication  Aside  Is most impossible I cannot 'tis in vain  Titus  Proceed  What dost thou mean to tell me  Sextus  That the fates  Avenging fates have hurl'd their curses on me  That I no longer can sustain the load  Of my sad destiny that I proclaim myself  A traitor villain that I merit death  And as the last the greatest boon implore it  Cornelia  Not all the gods can save him  Titus  From this hour  All pressures of affection quit my breast  Make it a plate of iron no soft touch  To leave a print more than the reptile's trail  Wiped off with scorn and loathing Armed files  Observant of my danger watch my steps  Place them around my table and my couch  My food be tasted all my chambers search'd  For kindness is a fool dulleyed and dim  Losing the dolt who trusts him  Annius  Emperor  Titus  Away away I shall mistrust myself  Suspect my head may plot against my heart  My hand be arm'd 'gainst both My nature's frame  Is wrench'd by this convulsion  Sextus  Death's worst pang  To Cornelia  In his enkindled wrath I have proved already  Then welcome all to come  Titus  Hear me ungrateful  Tho' justice well might bid thy treacherous blood  Stream o'er these sands and from her steady throne  Unshaken hear thee howling yet for these  Unworthy as thou art who mourn thy folly  I spare thy life but from my sight for ever  From the wide precincts of imperial Rome  I banish thee Approach no more this city  Nor me thy injured master else thy life  With treble vengeance pays the disobedience  Sue not in vain for by Olympian Jove  To Cornelia  This stands immutablePublius lead on  VITELIA  entering attended by  ZANTHIA  Vitellia  Stand off and give me way This is no time  For forms and maiden coldness View me Rome  Behold the bridal of your destin'd empress  New pomp new triumphs wait your new Augusta  No Hymen now shall wave his sprightly torch  Nor choral virgins strew my paths with flowers  But the fell sisters wind the thin spun thread  And death and horror deck my funeral couch  Titus  Whence is that voice that makes my bosom's chords  Turning  Vibrate its mournful music ha our empress  Vitellia  Where is the senate that condemn'd young Sextus  Where he who durst accuse him turn to me  Ye undiscerning judges Saw ye not  A woman's rage a woman's jealousy  Kindled this brand of discord  Titus  Do I wake  Sure the red Sirius from his fiery orb  Scattering contagious frenzy thro' the air  Has smote the general reason All's infection  Vitellia  Oh Sextus Sextus groveling at thy feet  Thus prostrate on the ground let me approach thee  Pardon thy murdress whose fleeting soul  Just hovers at her lips to catch that sound  And soon in night's eternal shade shall join thee  Sextus  Stop this wild frenzy to the world proclaim not  Vitellia  O glorious frenzy wou'd this feeble voice  Were loud as Jove in thunder that the poles  The high rais'd heaven might hear me I proclaim  Your cruel sentence void Can they condemn  The obedient hand the senseless instrument  And let the forming head the prompting heart  That instigate the crime pass by unpunish'd  Such Sextus is the hand of my device  By love well feign'd by Syren slattery  By tears by soothing every wile I wrought him  To plot his master's death Is Sextus guilty  No I and only I Revoke his doom  If Roman blood must gorge your lions maws  Cast forth Vitellia to them  Titus  Both I look at  Till wonder stifles angerThou Vitellia  With rancorous hate to raise the assassin's arm  Against my life  Vitellia  Far dearer than my own  Thy native inborn gentleness deceived me  And heighten'd kindness to a warmer flame  Oh 'tis the weakness of o'erweening love  To think a passion mutual where 'tis hoped  I hoped thy hand thy throne but twice postponed  I cou'd not bear the affront and sought thy ruin  I had no sex my heart was adamant  Titus  Then thus the long sought mystery's reveal'd  And thou the cause of all Restore his sword  The guilt which sprung from love I pardon freely  And thus embrace thee for that perilous honour  That nobly risk'd thy life and braved my anger  Embracing Sextus  Vitellia  Then I have saved him every bounteous God  On that forgiving head send blessings down  May laurel'd victory grace thy arms in war  And peace in soft security enfold thee  For me a draught of deadly aconite  Winds its cold current thro my freezing veins  Sextus farewell this serpent drinks my blood  Caesar I die  Sextus  What's this her quivering lips  Grow pale her gleaming eyes  Vitellia  Shoot their last sires  Ere this I had been dust but hope to save  Thy forfeit life like a strong antidote  A little while kept in the struggling soul  Titus  Poison'd  Zanthia  Too sure and by her own rash hand  Vitellia  A father's gift more dear than life he gave me  Titus  Unhappy fair one  Vitellia  Oh let none lament me  I was not form'd for happiness on earth  Downy it rests on the soft textur'd mind  Repelled from throbbing sensibility  Passions too strong a pride implacable  Had kept me restless even with all I wish'd  One glance from thee to any other woman  Had I once call'd thee mine had fired my brain  To some mad act to end like this in ruin  Light swims before meTitusOh farewell  Dies  Titus  Sextus delusion's victim this way turn  My heart once more is open to receive thee  Let friendship's gentler steadier flame dispel  The sad remembrance of that fatal passion  Sextus  May the black hour when first my heart conceived it  Be blotted from the Roman calendar  Or if it circles with the round of time  Disasters mark it All things thought or done  In that ill season like my luckless love  Find shame their issue till the dire increase  Of multiplied distractions end like this  In blindfold rage and desperate self destruction  Stabs himself  Cornelia  Horror on horror Annius Publius all  Arrest his furious arm He bleeds he dies  Titus  All but this blow I cou'd have pardon'd Sextus  This deed was all thy own it proudly spurns  The life my friendship gave my heart rejoiced in  Sextus  My prince my friend my father benefactor  Most dear by every name tho' wrong'd in all  Ask thy great heart cou'd I survive this shame  Has not this gazing city seen me shackled  Heard me pronounced a traitor doom'd to die  And worse than death have not my deeds deserv'd it  There was no way but this I can no more  Oh wou'd the darkness that invites my eyes  Might hide my name for ever Oh  dies  Annius  He's gone  wringing his hands  Titus  Annius I owe more tears to that pale corpse  Than Rome shall see me shed Break off the games  Let every sad and honourable rite  Hallow their urns Farewell ill fated pair  My sorrow shall embalm your memory  And with your ashes be your frailties buried  Curtain falls  FINIS  EPILOGUE  SUCH is the force of custom's powerful sway  An Epilogue must finish every play  But when or where or why the mode began  Tell it some stageread scholar if he can  I know enough for me that 'tis the fashion  Which governs this and every other nation  And yet to try with some poor paltry jest  To chase all tragic feelings from the breast  Appears to my weak judgment let me own  Like filling of the pail to kick it down  Nor less absurd than if some beauteous queen  With mantle flowing and majestic mein  More admiration of her charms to gain  Shou'd chuse a Monkey to bear up her train  Pray tell would Handel's oratorio's please  If clos'd with  Bobbin Joan  or  Butter'd Peas  Yet since the tyrant custom bids us try  To make you laugh whom we before made cry  I wish with all my heart our Proteus poet  Had rhym'd me something merry that would do it  No matter what of homely Gills or Jacks  Or Beaux with spider legs and lizard backs  How the bold spirit of the modern dame  Throned in her car drives the high road to fame  While more delight the labour can afford  To rule four coursers than obey one lord  Behold incumbent o'er her ponies backs  The sounding lash our female Jehu smacks  Thro' her small fingers plys her skilful reins  And cheers the nags with hoarse equestrian strains  "Gee Rainbow Peacock Button gee along  Then squares her elbows and confounds the throng  While her soft bosom too robustly feels  A man like glory from her kindling wheels  At these perhaps you have sometimes laugh'd before  Yet faith I wish you'd laugh at them once more  I'd do my best to oblige you as I live  Then in return for once to oblige me strive  Nor now to modern France can we resort  Murder and crimes make melancholy sport  Once 'twas a happy land for all conditions  Now all is assignats and requisitions  Nor does the war with Holland promise much  For who e'er brought home fancy from the Dutch  Pepper and cheese they had let us not wrong 'em  But scarce one sprig of bays e'er grew among 'em  The use of language as most travellers tell  They think was only given to buy and sell  And when three weighty words the price is spoke  Mynheer sinks down again to mum and smoke  But now 'tis time to drop the mimic art  And breathe one wish that swells each honest heart  May Britain's son's with victory by their side  Make Holland shake and humble Gallia's pride  The God of battle thro' all dangers guard 'em  And their best meed a Nation's thanks reward 'em
