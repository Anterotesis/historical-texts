 SPEED THE PLOUGH  A COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AT THE  THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  By THOMAS MORTON Esq AUTHOR OF "A CURE FOR THE HEART ACHE" "WAY TO GET MARRIED"  c c  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON  PRINTED BY A STRAHAN PRINTERSSTREET FOR T N LONGMAN AND O REES PATERNOSTERROW    Price Two Shillings  PROLOGUE  Written by  W T FITZGERALD Esq SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON  IN ev'ry age the trump of deathless fame  Proclaims the warrior's and the poet's name  Painting and sculpture all the pow'rs combine  And  laurels  deck the bard's and hero's shrine  No further can the parallel extend  The poet's honours on success depend  While Fortune's frown can ne'er molest the brave  Nor blast the laurel springing from his grave  An equal wreath impartial Fame supplies  To him who conquers and to him who dies  For British valor was displayed not more  On Nile's proud flood than Helder's barren shore  The chance of war the bravest may control  But leaves untouch'd the courage of the soul  And England gives her heroes ever dear  The shout of triumph or the starting tear  Not so the Bardwith him success is all  When Fortune frowns his airbuilt castles fall  But if she smiles he sails with prosperous breeze  Like the small Nautilus o'er Summer seas  Whose little oars on ocean's bosom sweep  Fearless of all the monsters of the deep  After a pause  Oft at  this Bar  our Author has been  tried  Where English Judges take the pris'ner's side  Guilty of faults no doubt he will appear  But human errors find acquittal here  Where e'en the friendless always meet support  From honest Juries and an upright Court  Critics who rule o'er politics and plays  If you are adverse vain the poet's lays  "You who with equal hands the balance hold  "Whose just decision ne'er was bought or sold  "But who to ev'ry candidate dispense  "His lot of humour and his share of sense"  Protect our Author on the coming day  And though you damn the Prologuespare the Play  To your decree each Dramatist must bow  Give but your aid and that will "Speed the Plough"  The lines marked with inverted commas were omitted  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Sir Philip Blandford  Mr POPE

therefore the humble native artist may ever hope to obtain from his countrymen those fostering smiles without which genius must sicken and industry decay But it requires no  valet de place  to conduct you through the purlieus of fashion for now the way of the world is for every one to pursue their own way and following the fashion is differing as much as possible from the rest of your acquaintance

unfortunately proved that at her ball there was room to dance and eat convenientlythat n  lady received a black eye and no coachman was killed the thing was voted decent and comfortable and scouted accordingly  Miss B  Is comfort then incompatible with fashion  Handy jun  CertainlyComfort in high life would be as preposterous as a lawyer's bag crammed with truth or his wig decorated with coquelicot ribbons Noit is not comfort and selection that is sought but numbers and confusion So that a fashionable party resembles Smithfield market only a good one when plentifully stockedand ladies

Never speak of him more Have you removed every dreadful vestige from the fatal chamber  EVERGREEN  hesitates    O speak  Everg  My dear master I confess my want of duty Alas I had not courage to go there  Sir Philip  Ah  Everg  Nay sorgive me wiser than I have selt such terrorsThe apartments have been caresully locked upthe keys not a moment from my possessionhere they are  Sir Philip  Then the

Enter  Miss BLANDFORD  Miss B  Dear father I came the moment I heard you wished to see me  Sir Philip  My good child thou art the sole support that props my feeble life I fear my wish for thy company deprives thee of much pleasure  Miss B  Oh no What pleasure can be equal to that of giving you happiness Am I not rewarded in seeing your eyes beam with pleasure on me  Sir Philip  'Tis the pale reflection of the lustre I see sparkling there My love did you enjoy the scenes you beheld  Miss B  Greatly How strongly they contrast with those we witnessed abroad  Sir Philip  True Happy country which in the midst of direful war can draw out its rustic train to join the festive dance as securely as if peace again had blessed the worldBut tell me did your lover gain the prize  Miss B  Yes papa  Sir Philip  Few men of his rank  Miss B  Oh you mean Mr Handy  Sir Philip  Yes  Miss B  No he did not  Sir Philip  Then who did  you  mean  Miss B  Did you say lover II mistookNo a young man called Henry obtained the prize  Sir Philip  And how did Mr Handy succeed  Miss B  Oh it was so ridiculous I will tell you papa what happened to him  Sir Philip  To Mr Handy  Miss B  Yes as soon as the contest was over Henry presented himself I was surprized at seeing a young man so handsome and elegant as Henry isthen I placed the medal round Henry's neck and I was told that poor Henry  Sir Philip  HenrySo my love this is your account of Mr Robert Handy  Miss B  Yes papano papahe came afterwards dressed so ridiculously that even Henry could not help smiling  Sir Philip  Henry again  Miss B  Then we had a dance  Sir Philip  Of course you danced with your lover  Miss B  Yes papa  Sir Philip  How does Mr Handy dance  Miss B  Oh he did not dance till  Sir Philip  You danced with your lover  Miss

papaand I am certain he don't love me  Sir Philip  Indeed  Miss B  Yes papa for when he touched my hand he trembled as if I terrified him and instead of looking at me as you do who I am sure love me when our eyes met he withdrew his and cast them on the ground  Sir Philip  And these are the reasons which make you conclude he does not love you  Miss B  Yes papa  Sir Philip  And probably you could adduce proof equally convincing that you don't love him  Miss B  Oh yesquite for in the dance he sometimes paid attention to other young women and I was so angry with him Now you know papa I love youand I am sure I should not have been angry with you had you done so  Sir Philip  But one question moreDo you think Mr Handy loves you  Miss B  I have never thought about it papa  Sir Philip  I am satisfied  Miss B  Yes I knew I should convince you  Sir Philip  Oh Love malign and subtle tyrant how falsely art thou painted blind 'Tis thy votaries are so for what but blindness can prevent their seeing thy poisoned shaft which is for ever doomed to rankle in the victim's heart  Miss B  Oh now I am certain I am not in love for I feel no rankling at my heart I feel the softest sweetest sensation I ever experienced But papa you must come to the lawn I don'tknow why but today Nature seems enchanting the birds sing more sweetly and the flowers give more perfume  Sir Philip  aside  Such

PHILIP  on secing him starts then becomes greatly agitated  Sir Philip  Ah do my eyes deceive me No it must be him Such was the face his father wore  Henry  Spake you of my father  Sir Philip  His presence brings back recollections which drive me to madness How came he here Who have I to curse for this  Miss B  falling on his neck  Your daughter  Henry  Oh Sir tell me on my knees I ask it do my parents live Bless me with my father's name and my days shall pass in active gratitude  my nights in prayers for you  Sir PHILIP  views him with severe contempt    Do not mock my misery Have you a

command is I obey itI shall often look at this  touching the medal  and think on the blissful moment when your hand placed it there  Sir Philip  Ah tear it from his breast  SERVANT  advances    Henry  Sooner take my life It is the first honour I have earned and it is no mean one for it assigns me the first rank among the sons or industry This is my claim to the sweet rewards of honest labour This will give me competence nay more enable me to despise your tyranny  Sir Philip  Rash boy mark Avoid me and be secureRepeat this intrusion and my vengeance shall pursue thee  Henry  I defy its powerYou are in England Sir where the man who bears about him an upright heart bears a charm too potent for tyranny to humble Can your frown wither up my youthful vigour NoCan your malediction disturb the slumbers of a quiet conscience No Can your breath stifle in my heart the adoration it feels for that pitying angel Oh no  Sir Philip  Wretch you shall be taught the difference between us  Henry  I feel it now proudly feel itYou hate the man that never wronged youI could  love the man that injures meYou meanly triumph o'er a wormI make a giant tremble  Sir Philip  Take him from my sight Why am I

then hope to be united  Miss B  O heaven  Sir Philip  Have you not promised me the disposal of your hand  Miss B  Alas my father I didn't then know the difficulty of obedience  Sir Philip  Hear then the reasons why I demand compliance You think I hold these rich estatesAlas the shadow only not the substance  Miss B  Explain my father  Sir Philip  When I left my native country I lest it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the falsehood of others or my own conscience could inflict Hateful to myself I became the victim of dissipationI rushed to the gaming table and soon became the dupe of villainsMy ample fortune  was lost I detected one in the act of sraud and having brought him to my feet he confessed a plan had been laid for my ruin that he was but an humble instrument for that the man who by his superior genius stood posseffed of all the mortgages and securities I had given was one Mortington  Miss B  I have heard your name him before Did you not know this Morrington  Sir Philip  No he like his deeds avoided the lightEver dark subtle and mysterious Collecting the scattered remnant of my fortune I wandered wretched and desolare till in a peaceful village I first beheld thy mother humble in birth but exalted in virtue The morning after our marriage she received a packet containing these words  The reward of virtuous love presented by a repentant villain  and which also contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thousand pounds  Miss B  And no name  Sir Philip  None nor could I ever guess at the generous donor I need not tell thee what my heart suffered when death deprived me of her Thus circumstanced this good man Sir Abel Handy proposed to unite our families by marriage and in consideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance agreed to pay off every incumbrance on my estates and settle them as a portion on you and his son Yet still another wonder remainsWhen I arrive I find no claim whatever has been made either by Morrington or his agents What am I to think Can Morrington have perished and with him his large claims to my property Or does he withhold the blow to make it fall more heavily  Miss B  'Tis very strange very mysterious But my father has not told me what misfortune led him to leave his native country  Sir Philip  greatly agitated  Ha  Miss B  May I not know it  Sir Philip  Oh never never never  Miss B  I will not ask

then  sarcastically  bid him approach  Exit  EVERGREEN  Enter  HENRY  Sir Philip  By what title Sir do you thus intrude on me  Henry  By one of an imperious nature the title of a creditor  Sir Philip  I  your  debtor  Henry  Yes for you owe me justice You perhaps withhold from me the inestimable treasure of a parent's blessing  Sir Philip  impatiently  To the business that brought you hither  Henry  Thus thenI believe this is your signature  producing a bond  Sir Philip  Ah  recovering himself  it is  Henry  Affixed to a bond of £ which by assignment is mine By virtue of this I discharge the debt of your worthy tenant Ashfield who it seems was guilty of the crime of vindicating the injured and protecting the unfortunate Now Sir Philip the retribution my hate demands is that what remains

He didand of your daughter "Conjure him" said he "not to sacrifice the lovely Emma by a marriage her heart revolts at" Teil him the life and fortune of a parent are not his own He holds them but in trust for his offspring  Bid him reflect that while his daughter merits the brightest rewards a father can bestow she is by that father doomed to the harshest fate tyranny can inflict  Sir Philip  Torture  with vehemence  Did he say who caused this sacrifice  Henry  He told me you had been duped of your fortune by sharpers  Sir Philip  Aye He knows that well Young man mark meThis Morrington whose precepts wear the face of virtue and whose practice seems benevolence was the chief of the hellish banditti that ruined me  Henry  Is it possible  Sir Philip  That bond you hold in your hand was obtained by robbery  Henry  Confusion  Sir Philip  Not by the thief who encountering you as a man stakes life against life but by that most cowardly villain who in the moment when reason sleeps and passion is roused draws his snares around you and hugs you to your ruin then fattening on the spoil insults the victim he has made  Henry  On your soul is Morrington that man  Sir Philip  On my soul he is  Henry  Thus then I annihilate the detested actand thus I tread upon a villain's friendship  tearing the bond  Sir Philip  Rash boy What have you done  Henry  An act of justice to Sir Philip
