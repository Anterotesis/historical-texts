 LEWIS BABOON  Turned Honest AND JOHN BULL POLITICIAN Being The FOURTH PART  OF Law is a BottomlessPit  Printed from a Manuscript found in the Cabinet of the famous Sir  Humphry Polesworth  And Publish'd as well as the Three former Parts and  Appendix  by the Author of the NEW ATALANTIS  LONDON  Printed for  John Morphew  near  StationersHall  Price d  THE PREFACE  WHEN I was first call'd to the Office of Historiographer to  John Bull  he express'd himself to this purpose  Sir  Humphry  I know you are a plain Dealer it is for that Reason I have chosen you for this important Trust speak the Truth and spare not  That I might fulfil those his honourable Intentions I obtain'd Leave to  repair  to and attend him in his most secret Retirements and I put the Journals of all Transactions into a strong Box to be open'd at a fitting Occasion after the manner of the Historiographers of some Eastern Monarchs This I thought was the safest way tho' I declare I was never afraid to be  chop'd  by my Master for telling of Truth It is from those Journals that my Memoirs are compil'd Therefore let not Posterity a thousand Years hence look for Truth in the voluminous Annals of Pedants who are entirely ignorant of the secret Springs of great Actions if they do let me tell them they will be  Nebus'd  With incredible Pains have I endeavour'd to copy the several Beauties of the ancient  and modern Historians the impartial Temper of  Herodotus  the Gravity Austerity and strict Morals of  Thucidides  the extensive Knowledge of  Xenophon  the Sublimity and Grandeur of  Titus Livius  and to avoid the careless Stile of  Polybius  I have borrow'd considerable Ornaments from  Dionysius Halicarnasseus  and  Diodorus Siculus  The  specious Gilding  of  Tacitus  I endeavour'd to shun  Mariana Davila  and  Fra Paulo  are those amongst the Moderns whom I thought most worthy of Imitation but I cannot be so disingenuous as not to own the infinite Obligations I have to the  Pilgrim's Progress  of  John Bunyan  and the  Tenter Belly  of the Reverend  Joseph Hall  From such Encouragement and Helps it is easy to guess to what a degree of Perfection I might have brought this great Work had it not been nip'd in the Bud by some illiterate People in both Houses of Parliament who envying the great Figure I was to make in future Ages under Pretence of raising Money for the War have padlock'd all those very Pens that were to celebrato the Actions of their Heroes by silencing at once the whole Ʋniversity of  Grubstreet  I am perswaded that nothing but the Prospect of an approaching Peace could have encourag'd them to make so bold a step But suffer me in the Name of the rest of the Matriculates of that famous Ʋniversity to ask them some plain Questions Do they think that Peace will bring along with it the Golden Age Will there be never a DyingSpeech of a Traitor Are  Cethegus  and  Cataline  turn'd so tame that there will be no opportunity to cry about the Streets  Dangerous Plot  Will Peace bring such Plenty that no Gentleman will have occasion to go upon the Highway or break into a House I am sorry that the World should be so much impos'd upon by the Dreams of a  False Prophet  as to imagine the  Millennium  is at hand O  Grubstreet  thou fruitful Nursery of tow'ring Genius's how do I lament thy Downfall Thy Ruin could never be meditated by any who means well to  English  Liberty No modern  Lycaeum  will ever equal thy Glory whether in soft Pasiorals thou sung the Flames of pamper'd Apprentices and coy CookMaids or mournful Ditties of departing Lovers or if to  Maeonian  Sirains thou rais'd thy Voice to record the Stratageies the arduous Exploits and the nocturnal Scalade of needy Heroes the Terror of your peaceful Citizen describing the powerful  Betty  or the artful  Picklock  or the secret Caverns and Grotto's of  Vulcan  sweating at his Forge and slamping the Queens Image on viler Metals which he retails for Beef and Pots of Ale or if thou wert content in simple Narrative to relate the cruel Acts of implacable Revenge or the Complaints of ravish'd Virgins blushing to tell their Adventure before the listening Crowd of City Damsels whilst in thy faithful History thou intermingles the gravest Counsels and the purest Morals Nor less acute and piercing wert thou in thy Search and pompous Description of the Works of Nature whether in proper  and emphatick Terms thou didst paint the blazing Comets fiery Tale the stupendous Force of dreadful Thunder and Earthquakes and the unrelenting Inundations Sometimes with  Machiavelian  Sagacity thou unravellest the Intrigues of State and the traiterous Conspiracies of Rebels giving wise Counsel to Monarchs How didst thou move our Terror and our Pity with thy passionate Scenes between  Jackcatch  and the Heroes of the  OldBaily  How didst thou describe their intrepid March up  HolbornHill  Nor didst thou shine less in thy theological Capacity when thou gavest ghostly Counsel to dying Felons and recorded the guilty Pangs of Sabbathbreakers How will the noble Arts of  John Overton'  s Painting and Sculpture now languish where rich Invention proper Expression correct Design divine Altitudes and artful Contrast heighten'd with the Beauties of  ClarObscur  embellish'd thy celebrated Pieces to the Delight and Astonishment of the judicious Multitude Adieu persuasive Eloquence the quaint Metaphor the poinant Irony the proper Epithet and the lively Simile are fled to  Burleigh on the Hill  Instead of these we shall have  I know not what  Vid  Bp of  St Asap  Preface  The Illiterate will tell the rest with Pleasure  I hope the Reader will excuse the Digression due by way of Condolance to my worthy Brethren of  Grubstreet  for the approaching Barbarity that is likely to overspread all its Regions by this oppressive and exorbitant Tax It has been my good Fortune  to receive my Education there and so long as I preserv'd some Figure and Rank amongst the Learned of that Society I scorn'd to take my Degree either at  Utrecht  or  Leyden  though I was offer'd it  gratis  by the Professors there  THE CONTENTS  Chap I THE Sequel of the History of the Meeting at the  Salutation Pag

left  John Bull  sitting between  Nic Frog  and  Lewis Baboon  with his Arms  akimbo  in great Concern to keep  Lewis  and  Nic  asunder As watchful as he was  Nic  found the Means now and then to stear a Whisper and by a cleanly Conveyance under the Table to slip a short Note into  Lewis  's hand  which  Lewis  as slyly put into  John  's Pocket with a Pinch or a Jog to warn him what he was about  John  had the Curiosity to retire into a Corner to peruse these  Billet deux  of  Nic  's wherein he found that  Nic  had used great Freedoms both with his Interest and Reputation One contained these words  Dear  Lewis  Thou seest clearly that this Blockhead can never bring his Matters to bear Let thee and me talk to night by our selves at the  Rose  and I'll give thee Satisfaction  Another was thus express'd  Friend  Lewis  Has thy Sense quite forsaken thee to make  Bull  such Offers Hold fast part with nothing and I will give thee a better Bargain I'll warrant thee  In some of his Billets he told  Lewis  "that  John Bull  was under his Guardianship that the best part of his Servants were at his Command that he could have  John  gagg'd and bound whenever he pleased by the People of his own Family"  In all these Epistles Blockhead Dunce Ass Coxcomb were the best Epithets he gave poor  John  In others he threatned  "that He Esquire  South  and the rest of the Tradesmen would lay  Lewis  down upon his Back beat out his Teeth if he did not retire immediately and break up the Meeting  I fancy I need not tell my Reader that  John  often chang'd Colour as he read and that his Fingers itch'd to give  Nic  a good Slap on the Chops but he wisely moderated  his cholerick Temper  "I sav'd this Fellow quoth he from the Gallows when he ran away from his last Master because I thought he was harshly treated but the Rogue was no fooner safe under my Protection than he began to lie pilfer and steal like the Devil When I first set him up in a warm House he had hardly put up his Sign when he began to debauch my best Customers from me Then it was his constant Practice to rob my Fishponds not only to feed his Family but to trade with the Fishmongers I conniv'd at the Fellow till he began to tell me that they were his as much as mine In my Manour of  Eastcheap  because it lay at some distance from my constant Inspection he broke down my Fences robb'd my Orchards and beat my Servants When I us'd to reprimand him for his Tricks he would talk saucily lye and brazen it out as if he had done nothing amiss Will nothing cure thee of thy Pranks  Nic  quoth I I shall be forced some time or another to chastise thee The Rogue got up his Cane and threatned me and was well thwack'd for his Pains But I think his Behaviour at this time worst of all after I have almost drowned my self to keep his Head above Water he would leave me sticking in the Mud trusting to his Goodness to help me out After I have beggar'd my  self with his troublesome LawSuit with a Pox to him he takes it in mighty Dudgeon because I have brought him here to end Matters amicably and because I won't let him make me over by Deed and Indenture as his lawful Cully which to my certain Knowledge he has attempted several times But after all canst thou gather Grapes from Thorns  Nic  does not pretend to be a Gentleman he is a Tradesman a selfseeking Wretch but how camest thou to bear all this  John  The Reason is plain Thou conferrest the Benefits and he receives them the first produces Love and the last Ingratitude Ah  Nic Nic  thou art a damn'd Dog that's certain thou knowest too well that I will take care of thee else thou would'st not use me thus I won't give thee up it is true but as true as it is thou shalt not sell me according to thy laudable Custom  While  John  was deep in this Soliloquy  Nic  broke out into the following Protestation  Gentlemen  I believe every body here present will allow me to be a very just and disinterested Person My Friend  John Bull  here is very angry with me forsooth because I won't agree to his foolish Bargains Now I declare to all Mankind I should be ready  to sacrifice my own Concerns to his Quiet but the care of his Interest and that of the honest Tradesmen that are embark'd with us keeps me from entring into this Composition What shall become of those poor Creatures The Thoughts of their impending Ruin disturbs my Night's Rest therefore I desire they may speak for themselves If they are willing to give up this Affair I shan't make two words of it  John Bull  begg'd him to lay aside that immoderate Concern for him and withal put him in mind that the Interest of those Tradesmen had not sat quite so heavy upon him some Years ago on a like Occasion  Nic  answer'd little to that but immediately pull'd out a Boatswain's Whistle upon the first Whiff the Tradesmen came jumping into the Room and began to surround  Lewis  like so many yelping Curs about a great Boar or to use a modester Simile like Duns at a great Lord's Leve the Morning he goes into the Country one pull'd him by the Sleeve another by the Skirt a third hallow'd in his Ear they began to ask him for all that had been taken from their Forefathers by Stealth Fraud Force or lawful Purchase some ask'd for Manours others for Acres that lay convenient for them that he would pull down his Fences level his Ditches all agreed in one common Demand that he should be  purg'd sweated vomited and starv'd till be came to a sizeable Bulk like that of his Neighbours one modestly ask'd him Leave to call him Brother  Nic Frog  demanded two Things to be his Porter and his Fishmonger to keep the Keys of his Gates and furnish his Kitchen  John  's Sister  Peg  only desir'd that he would let his Servants sing Psalms a Sundays some descended even to the asking of old Cloaths Shoes and Boots broken Bottles Tobaccopipes and Ends of Candles  Monsieur  Bull  quoth  Lewis  you seem to be a Man of some Breeding for God's sake use your Interest with these Messicurs that they wou'd speak but one at once for if one had a hundred pair of Hands and as many Tongues he cannot satisfy them all at this rate  John  begg'd they might proceed with some Method then they stop'd all of a sudden and would not say a word If this be your Play quoth  John  that we may not be like a Quaker's dumb Meeting let us begin some Diversion what d'ye think of RoulyPouly or a CountryDance What if we should have a Match at Football I am sure we shall never end Matters at this rate  CHAP II  How  John Bull  and  Nic Frog  settled their Accompts  J Bull  DƲring this general Cessation of Talk what if You and I  Nic  should enquire how Moneymatters stand between us  Nic Frog  With all my Heart I love exact Dealing and let  Hocus  Audit he knows how the Money was disburs'd  J Bull  I am not much for that at present we'll settle it between Ourselves Fair and Square  Nic  keeps Friends together There have been laid out in this LawSuit at one time Pounds and Crowns In some Cases I in others you bear the greatest proportion  Nic  Right I pay three Fifths of the greatest Number and you pay two Thirds of the lesser Number I think this is Fair and Square as you call it  John  Well go on  Nic  Two Thirds of Pounds are Pounds for your Share and there remains for mine Again Of the Crowns I pay which is three Fifths and you pay only which is two Fifths Crowns make Pounds and Crowns make Pounds and make and makes So there are Pounds to my Share of the Expences and to yours  After  Nic  had bambouzled  John  a while about the and the  John  call'd for Counters but what with Slight of Hand and taking from his own Score and adding to  John  's  Nic  brought the Balance always on his own side  J Bull  Nay good Friend  Nic  though I am not quite so nimble in the Fingers I understand Cyphering as well as you I will produce you my Accompts one by one fairly writ out of my own Books And here I begin with the first You must excuse me if I don't pronounce the Law Terms right  John Reads     l  s  d  Fees to the Lord Ch Justice and other Judges by way of Dividend        Fees to puny Judges        To Esquire  South  for  post Terminums        To ditto for  Non est Factums        To ditto for  Discontinuance Noli prosequi  and  Retraxit        To ditto for a  Non Omittas  and Filing a  post Diem        To  Hocus  for a  Dedimus potestatem        To ditto for  Casas  and  Fifas  after a  Devastait        Carry over        Brought over        To ditto for a  Capias ad computandum        To  Frog  's new Tenants  per  Account to  Hocus  for  Audita querelas        On the said Account for Writs of  Ejectment  and  Destringas        To Esquire  South  's Quota for a Return of a  Non est invent  and  nulla habet bona        To for a Pardon  in forma pauperis        To  Jack  for a  Melius inquirendum  upon a  Felo de se        To Don  Diego  for a  Defecit        To Coachhire        For Treats to Juries and Witnesses        Sum        Due by  Nic Frog        Of which paid by  Nic Frog        Remains due by  Nic Frog        Then  Nic Frog  pull'd his Bill out of his Pocket and began to read  Nicholas Frog  's Account Remains to be deducted out of the former Account     l  s  d  To  Hocus  for Entries of a  Rege inconsulto        To  John Bull  's Nephew for a  Venire facias  the Money not yet all laid out        The Coachhire for my Wife and Family and the Carriage of my Goods during the time of this LawSuit        For the extraordinary Expences of feeding my Family during this LawSuit        To  Major Ab        To  Major Will        Sum        From which deduct        There remains due to  Nic Frog        Besides recollecting I believe I paid for  Diego  's  Defecit  John Bull  As for your  Venire facias  I have paid you for one already in the other I believe you will be Nonsuited I'll take care of my Nephew my self Your  Coachhire  and Family Charges are most unreasonable Deductions  at that rate I can bring in any Man in the World my Debtor But who the Devil are those two  Majors  that consume all my Money I find they always run away with the Ballance in all Accompts  Nic Frog  Two very honest Gentlemen I assure you that have done me some Service  To tell you plainly  Major Ab  denotes thy greater Ability and  Major Will  thy greater Willingness to carry on this Lawsuit It was but reasonable thou shouldst pay both for thy  Power  and thy  Positiveness  J Bull  I believe I shall have those two honest Majors discount on my side in a little time  Nic Frog  Why all this Higgling with thy Friend about such a paltry Sum Does this become the Generosity of the Noble and Rich  John Bull  I wonder thou art not asham'd Oh  Hocus Hocus  where art thou it used to go anotherguess manner in thy time when a poor Man has almost undone himself for thy sake thou art for fleecing him and fleecing him is that thy Conscience  John  J Bull  Very pleasant indeed it is well known thou retains thy Lawyers by the Year so a fresh Lawsuit adds but little to thy Expence they are thy Customers I hardly ever sell them a Farthings worth of any thing nay thou hast set up an Eatinghouse where the whole Tribe of them spend all they can rap or run if it were well reckon'd I believe  thou gets more of my Money than thou spends of thy own However if thou wilt needs plead Poverty own at least that thy Accompts are false  Nic Frog  No marry won't I I refer my self to these honest Gentlemen let them judge between us let Esquire  South  speak his Mind whither my Accounts are not right and whither we ought not to go on with our Lawsuit  J Bull  Consult the Butchers about keeping of  Lent  I tell you once for all  John Bull  knows where his Shoe pinches none of your Esquires shall give him the Law as long as he wears this trusty Weapon by his side or has an inch of broad Cloath in his Shop  Nic Frog  Why there it is you will be both Judge and Party I am sorry thou discoverest so much of thy headstrong Humour before these strange Gentlemen I have often told you that it would prove thy Ruin some time or another  John  saw clearly he should have nothing but wrangling and that he should have as little Success in settling his Accounts as ending the Composition Since they will needs overload my Shoulders quoth  John  I shall throw down the Burden with a squash amongst them take it up who dares a Man has a fine time of it amongst a combination of Sharpers that Vouch for one anothers Honesty  John  look to thy self Old  Lewis  makes reasonable  Offers when thou hast spent the small Pittance that is left thou wilt make a glorious Figure when thou art brought to live upon  Nic Frog  and Esquire  South  's Generosity and Gratitude if they use thee thus when they want thee what will they do when thou wants them I say again  John  look to thy self  John  wisely stiffled his Resentments and told the Company that in a little time he should give them Law or something better  All  Law Law Sir by all means what is Twenty Two poor Years towards the finishing a Lawsuit For the Love of God more Law Sir  J Bull  Prepare your Demands how mamany Years more of Law you want that I may order my Affairs accordingly In the mean while farewel  CHAP III  How  John Bull  found all his Family in an Ʋproar at Home  NIc Frog  who thought of nothing but carrying  John  to the Market and there disposing of him as his own proper Goods was mad to find that  John  thought himself now of Age to look afer his own Affairs He resolv'd to traverse this  new Project and to make him uneasie in his own Family He had corrupted or desuded most of his Servants into the extravagantest Conceits in the World that their Master was run mad and wore a Dagger in one Pocket and Poison in the other that he had told his Wife and Children to  Lewis  disinherited his Heir and was going to settle his Estate upon a Parish Boy that if they did not look after their Master he would do some very mischievous Thing When  John  came home he found a more surprising Scene than any he had yet met with and that you will say was somewhat extraordinary  He call'd his Cookmaid  Betty  to bespeak his Dinner  Betty  told him  That she beg'd his Pardon she could not dress Dinner till she knew what he intended to do with his Will  Why  Betty  Forsooth quoth  John  thou art not run mad art thou My Will at present is to have Dinner That may be quoth  Betty  but my Conscience won't allow me to dress it till I know whither you intend to do righteous Things by your Heir I am sorry for that  Betty  quoth  John  I must find some body else then Then he call'd  John  the Barber Before I begin quoth  John  I hope your Honour won't be offended if I ask you whither you intend to after your Will If you won't give me a positive Answer your Beard may grow down to your Middle for me I gad and so it shall quoth  Bull  for I will never trust my Throat  in such a mad Fellows Hands Where's  Dick  the Butler Look ye quoth  Dick  I am very willing to serve you in my Calling d'ye see but there are strange Reports and plaindealing is best d'ye see I must be satisfied if you intend to leave all to your Nephew and if  Nic Frog  is still your Executor d'ye see if you will not satisfie me as to these Points d'ye see you may drink with the Ducks And so I will quoth  John  rather than keep a Butler that loves my Heir better than my self  Hob  the Shoemaker and  Pricket  the Taylor told him they would most willingly serve him in their several Stations if he would promise them never to talk with  Lewis Baboon  and let  Nicolas Frog  Linnendraper manage his Concerns that they could neither make Shoes nor Cloaths to any that were not in good Correspondence with their worthy Friend  Nicolas  J Bull  Call  Andrew  my JourneyMan How goes Affairs  Andrew  I hope the Devil has not taken Possession of thy Body too  Andrew  No Sir I only desire to know what you would do if you were dead  J Bull  Just as other dead Folks do  Andrew  This is Amazing  Aside  Andrew  I mean if your Nephew shall inherit your Estate  J Bull  That depends upon himself I shall do nothing to hinder him  Andrew  But will you make it sure  J Bull  Thou mean'st that I should put him in Possession for I can make it no surer without that he has all the Law can give him  Andrew  Indeed Possession as you say would make it much surer they say it is eleven points of the Law  John  began now to think that they were all enchanted he enquires about the Age of the Moon if  Nic  had not given them some intoxicating  Potion  or if old Mother  Jenisa  was not still alive No o'my faith quoth  Harry  I believe there is no  Potion  in the Case but a little  Aurum Potabile  You will have more of this by and by He had scarce spoke the Word when of a sudden  Don Diego  follow'd by a great Multitude of his Tenants and Workmen came rushing into the Room  D Diego  Since those worthy Persons who are as much concern'd for your Safety as I am have employ'd me as their Orator I desire to know whither you will have it by way of  Syllogism Enthymem Dilemma  or  Sorites  John  now began to be diverted with their Extravagance  J Bull  Let's have a  Sorites  by all means tho' they are all new to me  D Diego  It is evident to all that are versed in History that there were two  Sisters  that play'd the Whore two thousand Years ago Therefore it plainly follows that it is not lawful for  John Bull  to have any manner  of Entercourse with  Lewis Baboon  If it is not lawful for  John Bull  to have any manner of Entercourse Correspondence if you will that is much the same thing then  a Fortiori  it is much more unlawful for the said  John  to make over his Wife and Children to the said  Lewis  if his Wife and Children are not to be made over he is not to wear a Dagger and Ratsbane in his  Pockets  if he wears a Dagger and Ratsbane it must be to do Mischief to himself or some body else if he intends to do Mischief he ought to be under Guardians and there is none so fit as my self and some other worthy Persons who have a Commission for that purpose from  Nic Frog  the Executor of his Will and Testament  J Bull  And this is your  Sorites  you say with that he snatch'd a good tough Oaken Cudgel and began to brandish it then happy was the Man that was first at the Door crouding to get out they tumbled down Stairs and it is credibly reported some of them drop'd very valuable Things in the hurry which were pick'd up by others of the Family  That any of these Rogues quoth  John  should imagine I am not as much concern'd as they about having my Affairs in a settled Condition or that I would wrong my Heir for I know not what Well  Nic  I really cannot but applaud thy Diligence I must own  this is really a pretty sort of a Trick but it shan't do thy Business for all that  CHAP IV  How  Lewis Baboon  came to visit  John Bull  and what pass'd between them  I Think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the Reader that this Chapter was not wrote by Sir  Humphry  himself but by another very able  Pen  of the University of  Grubstreet  John  had by some good Instructions that was given him by Sir  Roger  got the better of his Cholerick Temper and wrought himself up to a great steadiness of Mind to pursue his own Interest through all Impediments that were thrown in the way he began to leave off some of his old Aquaintance his roaring and bullying about the Streets he put on a serious Air knit his Brows and for the time had made a very considerable progress in Politicks considering that he had been kept a stranger to his own Affairs However he could not help discovering some remains of his Nature when he happen'd to meet with a FootBall or a Match at Cricket for which Sir  Roger  was sure to take him to task  John  was walking about his Room with folded Arms and a most thoughtful Countenance his Servant brought him Word that one  Lewis  Baboon  below wanted to speak with him  John  had got an Impression that  Lewis  was so deadly a cunning Man that he was afraid to venture himself alone with him At last he took heart of Grace  Let him come up  quoth he  it is but sticking to my Point and he can never overreach me  Lewis Baboon  Monsieur  Bull  I will frankly acknowledge that my Behaviour to my Neighbours has been somewhat uncivil and I believe you will readily grant me that I have met with Usage accordingly I was fond of Backsword and Cudgel play from my Youth and I now bear in my Body many a black and blue Gash and Scars God knows I had as good a Warehouse and as fair Possessions as any of my Neighbours tho' I say it but a contentious Temper flattering Servants and unfortunate Stars have brought me into Circumstances that are not unknown to you These my Misfortunes are heighten'd by domestick Calamities that I need not relate I am a poor old batter'd Fellow and I would willingly end my Days in Peace But alas I see but small hopes of that for every new Circumstance affords an Argument to my Enemies to pursue their Revenge formerly I was to be bang'd because I was too Strong and now because I am too Weak to resist I am to be brought down when too Rich and oppressed when too Poor  Nic Frog  has used me like a  Scoundrel  You are a  Gentleman and I freely put my self in your Hands to dispose of me as you think fit  J Bull  Look you Master  Baboon  as to your Usage of your Neighbours you had best not dwell too much upon that Chapter let it suffice at present that you have been met with you have been rolling a great Stone uphill all your Life and at last it has come tumbling down till it is like to crush you to pieces Plaindealing is best If you have any particular Mark Mr  Baboon  whereby one may know when you Fib and when you speak Truth you had best tell it me that one may proceed accordingly but since at present I know of none such it is better that you should trust me than that I should trust you  L Baboon  I know of no particular Mark of Veracity amongst us Tradesmen but Interest and it is manifestly mine not to deceive you at this time you may safely trust me I can assure you  J Bull  The Trust I give is in short this I must have something in hand before I make the Bargain and the rest before it is concluded  L Baboon  To shew you I deal fairly name your Something  J Bull  I need not tell thee old Boy thou canst guess  L Baboon  Ecclesdown Castle  I'll warrant you because it has been formerly in your  Family Say no more you shall have it  J Bull  I shall have it to m'own self  L Baboon  To thy n'own self  J Bull  Every Wall Gate Room and Inch of  Ecclesdown Castle  you say  L Baboon  Just so  J Bull  Every single Stone of  Ecclesdown Castle  to m'own self speedily  L Baboon  When you please what needs more Words  J Bull  But tell me old Boy hast thou laid aside all thy  Equivocals  and  Mentals  in this case  L Baboon  There is nothing like Matter of Fact Seeing is Believing  J Bull  Now thou talk'st to the purpose let us shake Hands old Boy Let me ask thee one Question more What hast thou to do to meddle with the Affairs of my Family To dispose of my Estate old Boy  L Baboon  Just as much as you have to do with the Affairs of Lord  Strut  J Bull  Ay but my Trade my very Being was concern'd in that  L Baboon  And my Interest was concern'd in the other but let us drop both our Pretences for I believe it is a moot point whether I am more likely to make a Master  Bull  or you a Lord  Strut  J Bull  Agreed old Boy but then I must have Security that I shall carry my Broadcloth to Market old Boy  L Baboon  That you shall  Ecclesdown Castle Ecclesdown  Remember that Why would'st thou not take it when it was offer'd thee some Years ago  J Bull  I would not take it because they told me thou would'st not give it me  L Baboon  How could Monsieur  Bull  be so grosly abused by downright Nonsense They that advised you to refuse must have believed I intended to give else why would they not make the Experiment But I can tell you more of that Matter than perhaps you know at present  J Bull  But what say'st thou as to the Esquire  Nic Frog  and the rest of the Tradesmen I must take care of them  L Baboon  Thou hast but small Obligations to  Nic  to my certain Knowledge He has not us'd me like a Gentleman  J Bull  Nic  indeed is not very nice in your Punctilio's of Ceremony he is Clownish as a Man may say Belching and Calling of Names have been allow'd him time out of mind by Prescription but however we are engag'd in one Common Cause and I must look after him  L Baboon  All Matters that relate to him and the rest of the Plantiffs in this LawSuit I will refer to your Justice  CHAP V  Nic Frog  's Letter to  John Bull  wherein he endeavours to vindicate all his Conduct with relation to  John Bull  and the LawSuit  NIC  perceiv'd now that his Cully had elop'd that  John  intended henceforth to deal without a Broker but he was resolv'd to leave no Stone unturn'd to recover his Bubble Amongst other Artifices he wrote a most obliging Letter which he sent him Printed in a fair Character  Dear Friend  When I consider the late ill Usage I have met with from you I was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it but upon a narrow Inspection into my Conduct I can find nothing to reproach my self with but too partial a Concern for your Interest You no sooner set this Composition afoot but I was ready to comply and prevented your very Wishes and the Affair might have been ended before now had it not been for the greater Concerns of  Esq  South  and the other poor Creatures embark'd in the same Common Cause whose Safety touches me to the Quick You seem'd a little jealous that I bad dealt unfairly with you in Moneymatters  till it appear'd by your own Accounts that there was something due to me upon the Ballance Having nothing to answer to so plain a Demonstration you began to complain as if I had been familiar with your Reputation when it is well known not only I but the meanest Servant in my Family talk of you with the utmost Respect I have always as far as in me lies exhorted your Servants and Tenants to be dutiful not that I any ways meddle in your domestick Affairs which were very unbecoming for me to do If some of your Servants express their great Concern for you in a manner that is not so very polite you ought to impute it to their extraordinary Zeal which deserves a Reward rather than a Reproof You cannot reproach me for want of Success at the  Salutation  since I am not Master of the Passions and Interests of other Folks I have beggar'd my self with this LawSuit undertaken merely in Complaisance to you and if you would have had but a little Patience I had still greater things in Reserve that I intended to have done for you I hope what I have said will prevail with you to lay aside your unreasonable Jealousies and that we may have no more Meetings at the  Salutation  spending our Time and Money to no Purpose My Concern for your Welfare and Prosperity almost makes  me mad You may be assur'd I will continue to be  Your affectionate Friend and Servant NIC FROG  John  receiv'd this with a good deal of  Sang froid Transeat  quoth  John    cum caeteris erroribus  He was now at his Ease he saw he could now make a very good Bargain for himself and a very safe one for other Folks My Shirt quoth he is near me but my Skin is nearer Whilst I take care of the Welfare of other Folks no body can blame me to apply a little Balsam to my own Sores It's a pretty thing after all for a Man to do his own Business a Man has such a tender Concern for himself there's nothing like it This is somewhat better I trow than for  John Bull  to be standing in the Market like a great Drayhorse with  Frog  's Paws upon his Head  What will ye give me for this Beast Serviteur  Nic Frog  you may kiss my Backside if you please  Though  John Bull  has not read your  Aristotles Plato  's and  Machiavels  he can see us far into a Milstone as another With that  John  began to chuckle and laugh till he was like to burst his Sides  CHAP VI  The Discourse that pass'd between  Nic Frog  and Esquire  South  which  John Bull  overheard  JOhn  thought every Minute a Year till he got into  Ecclesdown Castle  he repairs to the  Salutation  with a Design to break the Matter gently to his Partners Before he enter'd he overheard  Nic  and the Esquire in a very pleasant Conference  Esq  South  Oh the Ingratitude and Injustice of Mankind That  John Bull  whom I have honour'd with my Friendship and Protection so long should flinch at last and pretend that he can disburse no more Money for me that the Family of the  Souths  by his sneaking Temper should be kept out of their own  Nic Frog  An't like your Worship I am in amaze at it I think the Rogue should be compell'd to do his Duty  Esq  South  That he should prefer his scandalous Pelf the Dust and Dregs of the Earth to the Prosperity and Grandeur of my Family  Nic Frog  Nay he is mistaken there too for he would quickly lick himself whole again by his Vails It's strange he should prefer  Philip Baboon  's Custom to  Esq  South  's  Esq  South  As you say that my Clothier that is to get so much by the Purchase should refuse to put me in Possession did you ever know any Man's Tradesman serve him so before  Nic Frog  No indeed an't please your Worship it is a very unusual Proceeding and I would not have been guilty of it for the World If your Honour had not a great Stock of Moderation and Patience you would not bear it so well as you do  Esq  South  It is most intolerable that's certain  Nic  and I will be reveng'd  Nic Frog  Methinks it is strange that  Philip Baboon  's Tenants do not all take your Honour's part considering how good and gentle a Master you are  Esq  South  True  Nic  but few are sensible of Merit in this World It is a great Comfort to have so faithful a Friend as thy self in so critical a Juncture  Nic Frog  If all the World should forsake you be assur'd  Nic Frog  never will let us stick to our Point and we'll manage  Bull  I'll warrant ye  Esq  South  Let me kiss thee dear  Nic  I have found one honest Man amongst a thousand at last  Nic Frog  If it were possible your Honour has it in your Power to wed me still closer to your Interest  Esq  South  Tell me quickly dear  Nic  Nic Frog  You know I am your Tenant the Difference between my Lease and an Inheritance is such a Trifle as I am sure you will not grudge your poor Friend that will be an Encouragement to go on besides it will make  Bull  as mad as the Devil You and I shall be able to manage him then to some purpose  Esq  South  Say no more it shall be done  Nic  to thy Heart's Content  John  all this while was listening to this comical Dialogue and laugh'd heartily in his Sleeve at the Pride and Simplicity of the  Esquire  and the sly Roguery of his Friend  Nic  Then of a sudden bolting into the Room he began to tell them that he believ'd he had brought  Lewis  to reasonable Terms if they would please to hear them  Then they all bawl'd out aloud  No Composition Long live Esquire  South  and the Law  As  John  was going to proceed some roar'd some stamp'd with their Feet others stop'd their Ears with their Fingers  Nay Gentlemen quoth  John  if you will but stop proceeding for a while you shall judge your selves whether  Lewis  's Proposals are reasonable  All  Very fine indeed stop proceeding and so lose a Term  J Bull  Not so neither we have something by way of Advance he will put us in Possession of his Mannor and Castle of  Ecclesdoun  Nic Frog  What dost talk of us thou mean'st thy self  J Bull  When  Frog  took Possession of any thing it was always said to be for  Ʋs  and why may not  John Bull  be  Ʋs  as well as  Nic Frog  was  Ʋs  I hope  John Bull  is no more confin'd to Singularity than  Nic Frog  or take it so the constant Doctrine that thou hast preach'd up for many Years was that Thou and I are One and why must we be supposed Two in this Case that were always One before It's impossible that Thou and I can fall out  Nic  we must trust one another I have trusted thee with a great many things prithee trust me with this one Trifle  Nic Frog  That Principle is true in the main but there is some Speciality in this Case that makes it highly inconvenient for us both  J Bull  Those are your Jealousies that the common Enemies sow between us how often hast thou warn'd me of those Rogues  Nic  that would make us mistrustful of one another  Nic Frog  This  Ecclesdoun  Castle is only a Bone of Contention  J Bull  It depends upon you to make it so for my part I am as peaceable as a Lamb  Nic Frog  But do you consider the unwholesomness of the Air and Soil the Expences of Reparations and Servants I would scorn to accept of such a Quagmire  J Bull  You are a great Man  Nic  but in my Circumstances I must be e'en content to take it as it is  Nic Frog  And you are really so silly as to believe the old cheating Rogue will give it you  J Bull  I believe nothingbut Matter of Fact I stand and fall by that I am resolv'd to put him to it  Nic Frog  And so relinquish the hopefulest Cause in the World a Claim that will certainly in the End make thy Fortune for ever  J Bull  Wilt thou purchase it  Nic  thou shalt have a lumping Pennyworth nay rather than we should differ I'll give thee fomething to take it off my Hands  Nic Frog  If thou would'st but moderate that hasty impatient Temper of thine thou should'st quickly see a better thing than all that What should'st thou think to find old  Lewis  turn'd out of his paternal Estates and Mansionhouse of  ClayPool  Would not that do thy Heart good to see thy old Friend  Nic Frog  Lord of  Clay Pool  Then thou and thy Wife and Children shall walk in my Gardens buy Toys drink Lemonade and now and then we should have a Countrydance  J Bull  I love to be plain I'd as lieve see my self in  Ecclesdoun  Castle as thee in  ClayPool  I tell you again  Lewis  gives this as a  Pledge of his Sincerity if you won't stop proceeding to hear him I will  CHAP VII  The rest of  Nic  's Fetches to keep  John  out of  Ecclesdoun  Castle  WHEN  Nic  could not diswade  John  by Argument he try'd to move his Pity he pretended to be sick and like to dye that he should leave his Wife and Children in a starving Condition if  John  did abandon him that he was hardly able to craul about the Room far less capable to look after such a troublesome Business as this Lawsuit and therefore begg'd that his good Friend would not leave him When he saw that  John  was still inexorable he pull'd out a CaseKnife with which he used to Sneakersnee and threaten'd to cut his own Throat  "Thrice he aim'd the Knife to his Wind pipe with a most determin'd threatning Air What signifies Lise quoth he in this languishing Condition it will be some Pleasure that my Friends will revenge my Death upon this barbarous Man that has been the Cause of it  All this while  John  look'd Sedate and Calm neither offering in the least to snatch the Knife nor stop his Blow trusting to the Tenderness  Nic  had for his own Person  When he perceiv'd that  John  was immoveable in his Purpose he apply'd himself to  Lewis  Art thou quoth he turn'd Bubble in thy Old Age from being a Sharper in thy Youth what occasion hast thou to give up  Ecclesdoun  Castle to  John Bull  his Friendship is not worth a Rush give it me and I'll make it worth the while If thou dislikest that Proposition keep it thy self I'd rather thou shouldest have it than he If thou hearkens not to my Advice take what follows Esquire  South  and I will go on with our Lawsuit in spite of  John Bull  's Teeth  L Baboon  Monsieur  Bull  has used me like a Gentleman and I am resolv'd to make good my Promise and trust him for the Confequences  Nic Frog  Then I tell thee thou art an old doating Fool With that  Nic  bounc'd up with a Spring equal to that of one of your nimblest Tumblers or Rope dancers falls foul upon  John Bull  to snatch the Cudgel he had in his Hand that he might Thwack  Lewis  with it  John  held it fast so that there was no wrenching it from him At last  Esquire South  buckl'd to to assist his Friend  Nic John  hall'd on one side and they two on the other sometimes they were like to pull  John  over then it went all of a sudden again on  John  's side so they went seesawing up and down from one End of the Room to the  other Down tumbl'd the Tables Bottles Glassēs and Tobacco Pipes The Wine and the Tobacco were all spilt about the Room and the little Fellows were almost trod under Foot 'till more of the Tradesmen joyning with  Nic  and the Esquire  John  was hardly able to pull against them all yet he never quit hold of his trusty Cudgel which by the contranitent Force of two so great Powers broke short in his Hands  Nic  seiz'd the longer end and with it began to Bastinado Old  Lewis  who had slunk into a Corner waiting the Event of this Squabble  Nic  came up to him with an insolent menacing Air so that the old Fellow was forc'd to skuttle out of the Room and retire behind a Dungcart He call'd to  Nic  thou insolent Jackanapes time was when thou durst not have used me so thou now takest me unprovided but old and infirm as I am I shall find a Weapon by and by to chastise thy Impudence  When  John Bull  had recover'd his Breath he began to parly with  Nic Friend  Nic  I am glad to find thee so strong after thy great Complaints really thy Motions  Nic  are pretty Vigorous for a consumptive Man  As for thy worldly Affairs  Nic  if it can do thee any Service I freely make over to thee this profitable Lawsuit and I desire all these Gentlemen to bear witness to this my Act and Deed yours be all the Gain as mine has been the  Charges I have brought it to bear finely However all I have laid out upon it goes for nothing thou shalt have it with all its Appurtenances I ask nothing but leave to go home  Nic Frog  The Counsel are fee'd and all Things prepared for a Tryal thou shalt be forced to stand the Issue It shall be pleaded in thy Name as well as mine Go home if thou can'st the Gates are shut the Turnpikes locked and the Roads barracado'd  J Bull  Even these very ways  Nic  that thou toldest me were as open to me as thy self If I can't pass with my own Equipage what can I expect for my Goods and Waggons I am deny'd Passage through those very Grounds that I have purchased with my own Money however I am glad I have made the Experiment it may serve me in some stead  John Bull  was so overjoy'd that he was going to take Possession of  Ecclesdoun  that nothing could vex him  Nic  quoth he  I am just a going to leave thee cast a kind look upon me at parting  Nic  look'd sower and grum and would not open his Mouth  J Bull  I wish thee all the Success that thy Heart can desire and that these honest Gentlemen of the long Robe may have their Belly full of Law  Nic  could stand it no longer but flung out of the Room with disdain and beckon'd the Lawyers to follow him  J Bull  Buy buy  Nic  not one poor Smile at parting won't you shake your dayday  Nic  Buy  Nic With that  John  march'd out of the common Road cross the Country to take Possession of  Ecclesdoun  CHAP VIII  Of the great Joy that  John  express'd when he got Possession of  Ecclesdoun  WHEN  John  had got into his Castle he seem'd like  Ʋlysses  upon his Plank after he had been well sous'd in Saltwater who as  Homer  says was as glad as a Judge going to sit down to Dinner after hearing a long Cause upon the Bench I dare say  John Bull  's Joy was equal to that of either of the two he skip'd from Room to Room ran up Stairs and down Stairs from the Kitchen to the Garrets and from the Garrets to the Kitchen he peep'd into every Crany sometimes he admired the Beauty of the Architecture and the vast Solidity of the Masons Work at other times he commended the Symetry and Proportion of the Rooms He walk'd  about the Gardens he Bath'd himself in the Canal swimming diving and beating the liquid Element like a milkwhite Swan The Hall resounded with the sprightly Violin and the martial Hautboy The Family trip'd it about and Caper'd like  Hailstones bounding from a Marble Floor  Wine Ale and October flew about as plentifully as KennelWater then a Frolick took  John  in the Head to call up some of  Nic Frog  's Pensioners that had been so mutinous in his Family  J Bull  Are you glad to see your Master in  Ecclesdoun  Castle  All  Yes indeed Sir  J Bull  Extremely glad  All  Extremely glad Sir  J Bull  Swear to me that you are so  Then they began to damn and sink their Souls to the lowest Pit of Hell if any Person in the World rejoyc'd more than they did  J Bull  Now hang me if I don't believe you are a parcel of perjur'd Raseals however take this Bumper of October to your Master's Health  Then  John  got upon the Battlements and looking over he call'd to  Nic Frog  How d'ye do  Nic  D'ye see where I am  Nic  I hope the Cause goes on swimmingly  Nic  when dost thou intend to go to  ClayPool Nic  Wilt thou buy there some HighHeads of the newest Cut for my Daughters How comest thou to go with thy Arm ty'd  up Has old  Lewis  given thee a rap over the Fingerends Thy Weapon was a good one when I weilded it but the Buttend remains in my Hands I am so busy in packing up my Goods that I have no time to talk with thee any longer It would do thy Heart good to see what Waggon Loads I am preparing for Market if thou wantest any good Office of mine for all that has happen'd I will use thee well  Nic  buy  Nic  {inverted ⁂} John
