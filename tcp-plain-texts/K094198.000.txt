 A COLLECTION OF POETICAL ESSAYS  CONSISTING OF  I An ELEGY on a  Pile  of SACRED RUINS imitating the Manner of Mr  Cunningham  's celebrated Elegy  II ELEGIAC REFLECTIONS written in the VAULT of ST NICHOLAS CHURCH  Newcastle upon Tyne  III FRAGMENT written among the RUINS of  Tinmouth Castle  and  Monastery  IV ODE for the  Nativity  of the MESSIAH  V MIRA's DESPAIR an ELEGY  VI ODE to PEACE  c  By  J B  of  Newcastle upon Tyne  NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE Printed by I THOMPSON  Esq    And Sold by the BOOKSELLERS in Town and Country  PREFACE  C  ONTEMPLATIONS  on the fluctuating  Uncertainty  of  Temporal Things  and the various  Evils  and  Vicissitudes  of  Human Life  as they have in all  Ages  claimed the  Attention  of the  good  and  serious  Part of  Mankind  so are in a more particular Manner beneficial to the  INTERESTS  of  CHRISTIANITY  They may be considered I presume as so many  Addenda  to throw  Light  and  moral Confirmation  upon those  VOLUMES  of  REVEALED WILL  which tho' presented to us in the  Medium  of a critically im∣perfect  Translation  proceed in their divine  ORIGINALS  from the immediate  Inspiration  of  unerring  and  eternal WISDOM  By Way of  Preface  to these  ELEGIAC ESSAYS  I have chosen to premise a few  Observations  of this Kind which to me at least appear the natural  Result  of every candid and impartial  Enquiry  after  Truth  Whosoever takes an unprejudiced  Survey  of the  FACULTIES  of the  HUMAN MIND  must necessarily acknowledge their  Constitution  to be in many Respects  ENIGMATICAL  and  CONTRADICTORY  and indeed whether we examine the  Public Annals  of  Society  or have Regard to the  Private Information  of our own  Consciences  whether the  Characters  of the  Learned  or  Illiterate  become  Objects  of our  Consideration  the  Truth  of this  Assertion  is made equally clear and conspicuousSeparately we may discern the same longing  Desires  after  Happiness  and yet voluntary  Subjection  to  Misery  the same boasted imaginary  Strength  and  Weakness  when tested by  Experience  the same  Love  of  Truth  and leaning  Credulity  towards  Error  In a Word the same diametrically opposite  Inclinations  of  Virtue  and  Vice  tho' varied in Proportion to an endless  Variety  of  Circumstances  pro∣ducing them    may be easily traced through the general  Tenor  of the  Actions  of  Mankind  and upon the whole form so intricate a  Knot  of  Contraricties  as unassisted  Reason  shall by no Means be able to unloose  If we further add to this seemingly unaccountable  Composition  of the  MIND  that  Multiplicity  of  Disorders Pains  and disastrous  Ac∣cidents  to which the  BODY  stands particularly exposed we may with  Hippocrates  almost venture to affirm  "The whole  Man  from his  Birth  is a  Disease" We may exclaim with the  Poet  O LIFE tremendous  Interval  of  Birth  and  Death  Who shall recount  thy  ILLS what  Hand  shall pen  Th' immeasurable  Logarithm  of  Woes  Mental  Anxieties  corporeal  Pains  That 'twixt these solemn  Periods  intervene  And with all possible  Justness  and  Propriety  may denominate  MAN  the  RIDDLE  of the  CREATION  I would infer from these  Observations  the apparent  Necessity  of  DIVINE REVELATION  how highly it behoves us to listen to the infallible  Dictates  of this great  CONDUCTRESS  whose peculiar  Pro∣vince  it is to point out the hidden  Causes  of all the inevitable  Miseries  and  Misfortunes  of  Human Life  as also how diffident we ought to be in trusling solely to the  Directions  of this so much boasted  Rational Faculty  which is but  moleey'd  at best and whose chief  Constituent  seems to be an inherent  Pride  which refuses to put on the  CHRISTIAN YOKE  and of consequence secludes us from being  Objects  of the  Fa∣vour  of the  SUPREME BENIGNITY  This blind  Reli∣ance  on our own  Strength  loosens insensibly the  Ties  of our  De∣pendance  upon him who is  ALLSUFFICIENT  We imperceptibly become ashamed of conversing with him by  Prayer  regard as  Superflui∣ty  the tributary Incense of  Gratitude  and  Praise  and at length wilfully shut our  Eyes  against the  midday Beams  of the  SUN OF RIGHT∣EOUSNESS  Hence  Irreligion Profaneness  groveling  Sensuality  and all that black  Catalogue  of  Crimes  which are the evident  Marks  of the benighted unregenerate  Mind  hence the  Beau Monde  the  Papilios  of the  Human Race  place their chief Happiness in contem∣plating the  Finery  of their own  Dress  the  Prude  or  Coquette  is more solicitous of  Admiration  in a brilliant  Assembly  upon  Earth  than studious to adorn herself for the inexpressibly magnificent  Assem∣bly  of the  FIRSTBORN  in  HEAVEN  Upon the whole  PRIDE  may be justly stiled the  Primum Mobile  of  Evil  the  Sire  of  Sin  the  Source  of  Mischief  and the  Bane  both of  Temporal  and  Eternal Felicity  J B  ARGUMENT  ELEGY may be termed with metaphorical  Propriety  the eldest  Daughter  of  Meditation  and highly merits the  Veneration  of the  Learned  and  Benevolent  as being a  Species  of the greatly di∣versified  Science  of  Poetry  every Way adapted to the serious  Taste  or solemn  Temper  of the human  Soul  When her  Theme  contem∣plates the short Duration of all earthly  Grandeur  in the awful  Ruins  of  Temples Towers  and other superb  Edifices  become a Prey to  Time  we are naturally led by her to a  Reflection  on the empty  Efforts  of ambitious  Art  the  Imbecillity  of mortal  Power  and the changing  Inconstancy  and  Vicissitude  of all  sublunary Things  {inverted ⁂} The public  Candour  is here more particularly requested as the following  Essays  are the first  Offspring  of a  Juvenile Muse  and on many Accounts of  Time Person  and  Circumstance  have been liable to  Hinderance  and unavoidable  Difficulties  If the  Attempt  merits the least  Shadow  of  Approbation  let the censorious  Criti∣cisins  of the  Injudicious  be its  Encomium  AN ELEGY ON A PILE of SACRED RUINS  The solemn  TEMPLES  Yea the great Globe itself and all which it inherit  Shall dissolve and like the baseless Fabrick of a Vision
