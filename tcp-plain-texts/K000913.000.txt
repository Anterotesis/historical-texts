 AN EPISTLE TO THE Right Honourable Sir  ROBERT WALPOLE  KNIGHT of the Most Noble Order of the Garter  By  RICHARD SAVAGE  Esq  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  MDCCXXXII Price one Shilling  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable Sir  ROBERT WALPOLE  STILL let low Wits who Sense nor Honour prize  Sneer at all Gratitude all Truth disguise  At living Worth because alive exclaim  Insult the Exil'd and the Dead defame  Such paint what Pity veils in private Woes  And what we see with Grief with Mirth expose  Studious to urgewhom will mean Authors spare  The Child's the Parent's and the Consort's Tear  Unconscious of what Pangs the Heart may rend  To lose what they have ne'er deserv'da Friend  Such ignorant of Facts invent relate  Expos'd persist and answer'd still debate  Such but by Foils the clearest Lustre see  And deem aspersing Others praising Thee  FAR from these Tracks my honest Lays aspire  And greet a gen'rous Heart with gen'rous Fire  Truth be my Guide Truth which thy Virtue claims  This nor the Poet nor the Patron shames  When PartyMinds shall lose contracted Views  And Hist'ry question the recording Muse  'Tis this alone to AfterTimes must shine  And stamp the Poet and his Theme divine  LONG has my Muse from many a mournful Cause  Sung with small Pow'r nor sought sublime Applause  From that great Point she now shall urge her Scope  On that fair Promise rest her future Hope  Where Policy from State Illusion clear  Can through an open Aspect shine sincere  Where Science Law and Liberty depend  And own the Patron Patriot and the Friend  That Breast to feel that Eye on Worth to gaze  That Smile to cherish and that Hand to raise  Whose best of Hearts her best of Thoughts inflame  Whose Joy is Bounty and whose Gift is Fame  WHERE for Relief flies Innocence distrest  To you who chase Oppression from th' Opprest  Who when Complaint to you alone belongs  Forgive your own tho' not a People's Wrongs  Who still make publick Property your Care  And thence bid private Grief no more despair  ASK they what State your shelt'ring Care shall own  'Tis Youth 'tis Age the Cottage and the Throne  Nor can the Prison 'scape your searching Eye  Your Ear still opening to the Captive's Cry  Nor less was promis'd from thy early Skill  Ere Power enforc'd Benevolence of Will  To Friends refin'd thy private Life adher'd  By thee improving ere by thee prefer'd  Well hadst thou weigh'd what Truth such Friends afford  With thee resigning and with thee restor'd  Thou taught'st them All  extensive  Love to bear  And now Mankind with thee their Friendships share  AS the rich Cloud by due Degrees expands  And showers down Plenty thick on sundry Lands  Thy spreading Worth in various Bounty fell  Made Genius flourish and made Art excell  HOW many yet deceiv'd all Power oppose  Their Fears increasing as decrease their Woes  Jealous of Bondage while they Freedom gain  And most oblig'd most eager to complain  BUT well we count our Bliss if well we view  When Power Oppression not Protection grew  View present Ills that punish distant Climes  Or bleed in Mem'ry here from ancient Times  MARK first the Robe abus'd  Religion  wore  Storied with Griefs and stain'd with human Gore  What various Tortures Engines Fires reveal  Study'd empower'd and sanctify'd by Zeal  STOP here my MusePeculiar Woes descry  Bid 'em in sad Succession strike thy Eye  Lo to her Eye the sad Succession springs  She looks she weeps and as she weeps she sings  SEE the doom'd  Hebrew  of his Stores bereft  See holy Murder justify the Theft  His ravag'd Gold some useless Shrine shall raise  His Gems on superstitious Idols blaze  His Wife his Babe deny'd their little Home  Stripp'd starv'd unfriended and unpity'd roam  LO the Priest's Hand the  WaferGod  supplies  A King by consecrated Poison dies  SEE  Learning  range you broad Etherial Plain  From World to World and Godlike Science gain  Ah what avails the curious Search sustain'd  The finish'd Toil the Godlike Science gain'd  Sentenc'd to Flames th'expansive Wisdom fell  And Truth from Heav'n was Sorcery from Hell  SEE  Reason  bid each mystic Wile retire  Strike out new Light and Markthe Wise admire  Zeal  shall such Heresy like  Learning  hate  The same their Glory and the same their Fate  Lo from sought Mercy one his Life receives  Life worse than Death that cruel Mercy gives  The Man perchance who Wealth and Honours bore  Slaves in the Mine or ceaseless strains the Oar  So doom'd are these and such perhaps our Doom  Own'd we a Prince avert it Heaven from  Rome  NOR private Worth alone false Zeal assails  Whole Nations bleed when Bigotry prevails  What are sworn Friendships What are Kindred Ties  What's Faith with Heresy the Zealot cries  See when War sinks the thund'ring Cannon's Roar  When Wounds and Death and Discord are no more  When Musick bids undreading Joys advance  Swell the soft Hour and turn the swimming Dance  When to crown these the social Sparkling Bowl  Lifts the chear'd Sense and pours out all the Soul  Sudden he sends red Massacre abroad  Faithless to Man to prove his Faith to God  What pure persuasive Eloquence denies  Alldrunk with Blood the arguing Sword supplies  The Sword which to th' Assassin's Hand is given  Th' Assassin's Handpronounc'd the Hand of Heaven  Sex bleeds with Sex and Infancy with Age  No Rank no Place no Virtue stops his Rage  Shall Sword and Flame and Devastation cease  To please with Zeal wild Zeal the  God  of  Peace  NOR less Abuse has scourg'd the Civil State  When a King's Will became a Nation's Fate  Enormous Pow'r Nor noble nor serene  Now fierce and cruel now but wild and mean  See Titles sold to raise th'unjust Supply  Compell'd the Purchase or be fin'd or buy  No public Spirit guarded well by Laws  Uncensur'd censures in his Country's Cause  See from the Merchant forc'd th'unwilling Loan  Who dares deny or deem his Wealth his own  Denying See where DungeonDamps arise  Diseas'd he pines and unassisted dies  Far more than Massacre that Fate accurst  As of all Deaths the ling'ring is the worst  NEW Courts of Censure griev'd with new Offence  Tax'd without Power and fin'd without Pretence  Explain'd at Will each Statute's wrested Aim  'Till Marks of Merit were the Marks of Shame  So monstrousLife was the severest Grief  And the worst Death seem'd welcome for Relief  IN vain the Subject sought Redress from Law  No Senate liv'd the partial Judge to awe  Senates were void and Senators confin'd  For the great Cause of Nature and Mankind  Who Kings superiour to the People own  Yet prove the Law superiour to the Throne  WHO can review without a gen'rous Tear  A Church a State so impious so severe  A Land uncultur'd thro' Polemic Jars  Richbut with Carnage from intestine Wars  The Hand of Industry employ'd no more  And Commerce flying to some safer Shore  All Property reduc'd to Pow'r a Prey  And Sense and Learning chas'd by Zeal away  Who honours not each dear departed Ghost  That strove for Liberty so won so lost  So well regain'd when Godlike  William  rose  And first entail'd the Blessing  George  bestows  May  Walpole  still the growing Triumph raise  And bid These emulate  Eliza  's Days  Still serve a Prince who o'er his People Great  As far transcends in Virtue as in State  THE Muse pursues thee to thy rural Seat  Ev'n there shall Liberty inspire Retreat  When solemn Cares in flowing Wit are drown'd  And sportive Chat and social Laughs go round  Ev'n then when pausing Mirth begins to fail  The Converse varies to the serious Tale  The Tale pathetic speaks some Wretch that owes  To some deficient Law reliefless Woes  What instant Pity warms thy gen'rous Breast  How all the Legislator stands confess'd  Now springs the Hint 'tis now improv'd to Thought  Now ripe and now to public Welfare brought  New Bills which regulating Means bestow  Justice preserve yet soft'ning Mercy know  Justice shall low vexatious Wiles decline  And still thrive most when Lawyers most repine  Justice from Jargon shall refin'd appear  To Knowledge thro' our native Language clear  Hence may we learn no more deceiv'd by Law  Whence Wealth and Life their best Assurance draw  THE freed  Insolvent  with industrious Hand  Strives yet to satisfy the just Demand  Thus ruthless Men who wou'd his Pow'rs restrain  Oft what Severity would lose obtain  THESE and a thousand Gifts thy Thought acquires  Which Liberty benevolent inspires  From Liberty the Fruits of Law increase  Plenty and Joy and all the Arts of Peace  Abroad the Merchant while the Tempests rave  Advent'rous sails nor fears the Wind and Wave  At Home untir'd we find th' auspicious Hand  With Flocks and Herds and Harvests bless the Land  While there the Peasant glads the grateful Soil  Here mark the ShipWright there the Mason toil  Hew square and rear magnificent the Stone  And give our Oaks a Glory not their own  What Life demands by this obeys her Call  And added Elegance consummates all  Thus stately Cities statelier Navies rise  And spread our Grandeur under distant Skies  From Liberty each nobler Science sprung  A  Bacon  brighten'd and a  Spenser  sung  A  Clarke  and  Locke  new Tracks of Truth explore  And  Newton  reaches Heights unreach'd before  WHAT Trade sees Property that Wealth maintain  Which Industry no longer dreads to gain  What tender Conscience kneels with Fears resign'd  Enjoys her Worship and avows her Mind  What Genius now from Want to Fortune climbs  And to  safe  Science ev'ry Thought sublimes  What Royal Pow'r from his superiour State  Sees public Happiness his own create  But kens those PatriotSouls to which he owes  Of Old each Source whence now each Blessing flows  And if such Spirits from their Heav'n descend  And blended flame to point one glorious End  Flame from one Breast and thence on  Britain  shine  What Love what Praise O  Walpole  then is thine  FINIS  ERRATÆ²M  Page Line leave out the  Comma  after  State
