WestminsterHall  Price One Shilling  Augusta Triumphans  OR THE WAY TO MAKE  LONDON  The most Flourishing CITY in the Universe  _A Man who has the Publick Good in View ought not in the least to be alarm'd at the tribute of Ridicule which Scoffers constantly pay to projecting Heads It is the Business of a Writer who means well to go directly forward without regard to Criticism but to offer his Thoughts as they occur and if in twenty Schemes he hits but on one to the Purpose he ought to be excused failing in the Nineteen for the Twentieth Sake 'Tis a kind of good Action to mean well and the Intention ought to palliate the Failure but the  English  of all People in the World show least Mercy to  Schemists for they treat them in the vilest manner whereas other Nations give them fair Play for their Lives which is the reason why we are esteem'd so bad at Invention  I have but a short Time to live nor would I waste my remaining Thread of Life in Vain but having often lamented sundry Publick Abuses and many Schemes having occur'd to my Fancy which to me carried an Air of Benefit I was resolv'd to commit them to Paper before my Departure and leave at least a Testimony of my good Will to my Fellow Creatures  But of all my Reflections none was more constantly my Companion than a deep Sorrow for the present decay of Learning among us and the manifest Corruption of Education we have been a brave and learned People and are insensibly dwindling into an Effeminate Superficial Race Our young Gentlemen are sent to the Universities 'tis true but not under Restraint or Correction as formerly not to study but to drink not for Furniture for the Head but a Feather for the Cap merely to say they have been at  Oxford  or  Cambridge  as if the Air of those Places inspir'd Knowledge without Application 'Tis true we ought to have those Places in Reverence for the many learned Men they have sent us but why must we go so far for Knowledge  why should a young Gentleman be sent raw from the Nursery to live on his own Hands to be liable to a thousand Temptations and run the Risque of being snapt up by sharping Jilts with which both Universities abound who make our Youth of Fortune their Prey and have brought Misery into too many good Families Not only the Hazard of their Healths from Debauches of both Kinds but the waste of their precious Time renders the sending them so far off very hazardous Why should such a Metropolis as  London  be without an University Would it not save considerably the Expence we are at in sending our young Gentlemen so far from  London  Would it not add to the Lustre of our State and cultivate Politeness among us What Benefits may we not in time expect from so glorious a Design Will not  London  become the Scene of Science And what reason have we but to hope we may vye with any Neighbouring Nations Not that I would have  Oxford  or  Cambridge  neglected for the Good they have done Besides there are too many fine Endowments to be sunk we may have Universities at those Places and at  London  too without Prejudice Knowledge will never hurt us and whoever lives to see an University here will find it give quite another turn to the Genius and Spirit of our Youth in general  How many Gentlemen pass their Lives in a shameful Indolence who might employ themselves to the purpose were such a Design set on foot Learning would flourish Art revive and not only those who study'd would benefit by it but the Blessing would be convey'd to others by Conversation  And in order to this so laudable design small Expence is required The sole Charge being the hire of a convenient Hall or House which if they please they may call a College But I see no necessity the Pupils have to lye or diet there that may be done more reasonably and conveniently at home under the Eye of their Friends Their only necessary Business at College being to attend their Tutors at stated Hours and Bed and Board excepted to conform themselves to College Laws and perform the same Exercises as if they were actually at  Oxford  or  Cambridge  Let the best of Tutors be provided and Professors in all Faculties encouraged this will do a double good not only to the Instructed but to the Instructors What a fine Provision may here be made for Numbers of ingenious Gentlemen now unpreferr'd And to what a heighth may even a small Beginning grow in time  As  London  is so extensive so its University may be compos'd of many Colleges quarter'd at convenient Distances for Example  one at  Westminster  one at St  James  's one near  Ormond Street  that part of the Town abounding in Gentry one in the Centre of the Inns of Court another near the  RoyalExchange  and more if Occasion and Encouragement permit  The same Offices and Regulations may be constituted Cooks Butlers Bedmakers  c  excepted as at other Universities As for Endowment there is no need the whole may be done by Subscription and that an easy one considering nothing but Instructions are paid for  In a Word an Academical Education is so much wanted in  London  that every Body of Ability and Figure will readily come into it and I dare engage the Place need but be chosen and Tutors approved of to compleat the Design at once  It may be objected that there is a kind of University at  GreshamCollege  where Professors in all Sciences are maintained and obliged to read Lectures every Day or at least as often as demanded The Design is most laudable but it smells too much of the  Sine Cure  they only read in TermTime and then their Lectures are so hurried over the Audience is little the better They cannot be turn'd out 'tis a good Settlement for Life and they are very easy in their Studies when once fix'd Whereas  were the Professorship during good Behaviour there would be a Study to maintain their Posts and their Pupils would reap the Benefit  Upon second Thought I think Colleges for University Education might be formed at  Westminster Eaton  the  CharterHouse  St  Pauls MerchantTaylors  and other Publick Schools where Youth might begin and end their Studies but this may be farther consider'd of  I had almost forgot the most material Point which is that his Majesty's Sanction must first be obtain'd and the University propos'd have Power to confer Degrees  c  and other Academical Priviledges  As I am quick to conceive I am eager to have done unwilling to overwork a Subject I had rather leave part to the Conception of the Readers than to tire them or my Self with protracting a Theme as if like a Chancery Man or a Hackney Author I wrote by the Sheet for hire So let us have done with this Topick and proceed to another which is  A Proposal to prevent Murder Dishonour and other Abuses by erecting an  Hospital  for Foundlings  IT is needless to run into a Declamation on this Head since not a Sessions passes but we see one or more merciless Mothers try'd for the Murder of their BastardChildren and to the Shame of good Government generally escape the Vengeance due to shedders of Innocent Blood For 'tis a common Practice now among them to hire a set of OldBedlams or pretended Midwives who make it their Trade to bring them off for three or four Guineas having got the ready rote of swearing the Child was not at its full Growth for which they have a hidden Reserve that is to say the Child was not at Man's or Woman's Growth Thus do these impious Wretches cheat the World and damn their own Souls by a double Meaning which too often imposes on a cautious merciful and credulous Jury and gives wicked Murderers means to escape and commit fresh Sins to which their Acquitters no doubt are accessary  I wonder so many Men of Sense as have been on the Jury have been so often impos'd  upon by the stale Pretence of a Scrap or two of ChildBed Linnen being found in the Murderer's Box  c  when alas perhaps it was ne'er put there till after the Murder was committed or if it was but with a view of saving themselves by that devilish Precaution for so many have been acquitted on that Pretence that 'tis but too common a Thing to provide ChildBedLinnen beforehand for a poor Innocent Babe they are determin'd to murder  But alas What are the exploded Murders to those which escape the Eye of the Magistrate and dye in Silence Add to this procur'd Abortions and other indirect means which wicked Wretchesmake use off to screen themselves from the Censure of the World which they dread more than the Displeasure of their Maker  Those who cannot be so hardhearted to murder their own Offspring themselves take a slower tho' as sure a way and get it done by others by dropping their Children and leaving them to be starved by ParishNurses  Thus is God robb'd of a Creature in whom he had breath'd the Breath of Life and on whom he had stamp'd his Image the World of an Inhabitant who might have been of use the King of a Subject and future Generations of an Issue not to be accounted for had this Infant lived to have been a Parent  It is therefore the height of Charity and Humanity to provide against this Barbarity to prevent this crying Sin and extract Good even out of Evil by saving these Innocent Babes from Slaughter and bringing them up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord to be of Benefit to themselves and Mankind in General  And what nearer what better way can we have than to erect and endow a proper Hospital or House to receive them where we may see them tenderly brought up as so many living Monuments of our Charity every one of them being a convincing Proof of a Christian saved and a Murder prevented  Nor will this be attended with so much Charge as is imagin'd for we find in many Parishes that Parents have redemanded their Children on encrease of Circumstances and paid all Costs with a handsome Present in the Bargain and many Times when a Clandestine Marriage is clear'd up and openly avow'd they would purchase the FirstFruits of their Loves at any Rate Oftentimes a Couple may have no more Children and an Infant thus sav'd may arrive to inherit a good Estate and become a Benefactor where it was once an Object of Charity  But let us suppose the worst and imagine the Infant begot in Sin and without  the Sanction of Wedlock is it therefore to be murder'd starv'd or neglected because its Parents were wicked hard Fate of innocent Children to suffer for their Parents Faults Where God has thought fit to give his Image and Life there is Nourishment demanded that calls aloud for our Christian and Human Assistance and best shows our Nobleness of Soul when we generously assist those who cannot help themselves  If the Fault devolv'd on the Children our Church would deny them Baptism Burial and other Christian Rites but our Religion carries more Charity with it they are not deny'd even to partake of our Blessed Sacraments and are excluded no one Branch or Benefit accruing from Christianity if so how unjust are those who arraign 'em for their Parents Faults and how barbarous are those Parents who tho' able make no Provision for them because they are not Legitimate My Child is my Child let it be begot in Sin or Wedlock and all the Duties of a Parent are incumbent on me so long as it lives if it survives me I ought to make a Provision for it according to my Ability and tho' I do not set it on a Footing with my Legitimate Children I ought in Conscience to provide against Want and Shame or I am answerable for every Sin or Extravagance  my Child is forc'd or led into for want of my giving an Allowance to prevent it  We have an Instance very fresh in every ones Memory of an ingenious nay a sober young Nobleman for such I must call him whose either Father was a Peer and his Mother a Peeress This unhappy Gentleman toss'd from Father to Father at last found none and himself a Vagabond forced to every Shift he in a manner starved for many Years yet was guilty of no Capital Crime till that unhappy Accident occur'd which God has given him Grace and Sense enoughto repent However I cannot but think his hardhearted Mother will bear her Portion of the Guilt till wash'd away by a severe Repentance  What a Figure might this Man have made in Life had due Care been taken If his Peerage had not been adjusted he might at least have been a fine Gentleman nay probably have fill'd some handsome Post in the Government with Applause and call'd as much for Respect as he does now for Pity  Nor is this Gentleman the only Person begot and neglected by Noble or rather Ignoble Parents we have but too many now living who owe their Birth to the best of our Peerage and yet know not where to eat Hard Fate when the Child would be glad  the Scraps which the Servants throw away but Heaven generally rewards them accordingly for many Noble Families are become Extinct and large Estates alienated into other Houses while their own Issue want Bread  And now methinks I hear some oversqueamish Ladies cry  what would this Fellow be at would not he set up a Nursery for Lewdness and encourage Fornication who would be afraid of sinning if they can so easily get rid of their Bastards we shall soon be overrun with  Foundlings  when there is such Encouragement given to  Whoredom To which I answer that I am as much against Bastards being begot as I am for their being murder'd but when a Child is once begot it cannot be unbegotten and when once born it must be kept the Fault as I said before is in the Parents not the Child and we ought to shew our Charity towards it as a FellowCreature and Christian without any regard to its Legitimacy or otherwise  The only way to put a stop to this growing Evil would be to oblige all Housekeepers not to admit a Man and Woman as Lodgers till they were certify'd of their being lawfully marry'd for nowaDays nothing is more common than for a Whoremonger and a Strumpet to pretend Marriage  till they have left a Child or two on the Parish and then shift to another end of the Town  If there were no Receivers there would be no Thieves If there were no BawdyHouses there would be no Whores and though Persons letting Lodgings be not actual Procurers yet if they connive at the Embraces of a Couple whose Marriage is doubtful they are no better than Bawds and their Houses no more than Brothels  Now should any Body ask how shall this Hospital be Built how endow'd to which I answer follow the Steps of the  Venetians  the  Hamburgers  and other foreign States  c  who have for Ages past prosecuted this glorious Design and found their Account therein As for building a House I am utterly against it especially in the Infancy of the Affair Let a Place convenient be hir'd Why should such a considerable Sum be sunk in building as has in late publick Structures which have swallow'd up part of the Profits and Dividend if not the Capital of unwary Stockmongers  To my great Joy I find my Project already anticipated and a noble Subscription carrying on for this purpose to promote which I exhort all Persons of Compassion and Generosity and shall think my self happy if what I have said on this Head may any ways contribute to further the same  Having said all I think material on this Subject I beg pardon for leaving my Reader so abrubtly and crave Leave to proceed to another Article  viz  A Proposal to prevent the expensive Importation of  Foreign Musicians  c by forming an Academy of our own  IT will no doubt be asked what have I to do with Musick to which I answer I have been a Lover of the Science from my Infancy and in my younger Days was accounted no despicable Performer on the Viol and Lute then much in Vogue I esteem it the most innocent Amusement in Life it gently relaxes after too great a hurry of Spirits and composes the Mind into a Sedateness prone to every thing that's generous and good and when the more necessary parts of Education are finish'd 'tis a most genteel and commendable Accomplishment it saves a great deal of Drinking and Debauchery in our Sex and helps the Ladies off with many an idle Hour which sometimes might probably be worse employ'd otherwise  Our Quality Gentry and better sort of Traders must have Diversions and if those that are commendable be denied they will take to worse Now what can be more commendable than Musick one of the seven liberal Sciences and no mean Branch of the Mathematicks  Were it for no other Reason I should esteem it because it was the favourite Diversion of his late Majesty of glorious Memory who was as wife a Prince as ever fill'd the  British  Throne Nor is it less esteem'd by their present Majesties whose Souls are form'd for Harmony and who have not disdain'd to make it a part in the Education of their sacred Race  Our Nobility and Gentry have shown their Love to the Science by supporting at such prodigious Expence the  Italian Opera  improperly call'd an Academy but they have at the same time shown no small Partiality in discouraging any thing  English  and overloading the Town with such heaps of Foreign  Musicians  An Academy rightly understood is a Place for the Propagation of Science by training up Persons thereto from younger to riper Years under the Instruction and Inspection of proper Artists How then can the  Italian Opera  properly be call'd an Academy when none are admitted but such as are at least are thought or ought to  be adepts in Musick If that be an Academy so are the Theatres of  DruryLane  and  LincolnsInnFields  Nay  Punch  's  Opera  may pass for a lower kind of Academy Would it not be a glorious thing to have an  Opera  of our own in our own most noble Tongue in which the Composer Singers and Orchestre should be of our own Growth Not that we ought to disclaim all Obligations to  Italy  the Mother of Musick the Nurse of  Corelli Handel Bononcini  and  Geminiani  but then we ought not to be so stupidly partial to imagine our Selves too Brutal a part of Mankind to make any Progress in the Science By the same reason that we love it we may excel in it Love begets Application and Application Perfection We have already had a  Purcel  and no doubt there are now many latent Genius's who only want proper Instruction Application and ENCOURAGEMENT to become great Ornaments of the Science and make  England  emulate even  Rome  it self  What a number of excellent Performers on all Instruments have sprung up in  England  within these few Years that this is owing to the  Opera  I will not deny and so far the  Opera  is an Academy as it refines the Taste and inspires Emulation  But tho' we are happy in Instrumental Performers we frequently send to  Italy  for Singers and that at no small Expence To remedy which I humbly propose that the Governours of  Christ'sHospital  will show their publick Spirit by forming an Academy of Musick on their Foundation after this or the like manner  That out of their great number of Children thirty Boys be selected of good Ears and Propensity to Musick  That these Boys be divided into three Classes  viz  Six for WindInstruments such as the Hautboy Bassoon and GermanFlute  That sixteen others be selected for StringInstruments or at least the most useful  viz  the Violin and BassViolin  That the remaining eight be particularly chosen for Voice and Organ or Harpsichord That all in due time be taught Composition The Boys thus chosen three Masters should be elected each most excellent in his Way that is to say one for the WindInstrument another for the String'd and a third for the Voice and Organ  c  Handsome Salaries should be allowed these Masters to engage their constant Attendance every Day from eight till twelve in the Morning and I think a  l per Annum  for each would be sufficient which will be a Trifle to so wealthy a Body  The multiplicity of Holidays should be abridg'd and only a few kept there cannot be too few considering what a hinderance they are to juvenile Studies It is a vulgar Error that has too long prevail'd all over  England  to the great Detriment of Learning and many Boys have been made Blockheads in Complaisance to Kings and Saints dead for many Ages past  The Morning employ'd in Musick the Boys should go in the Afternoon or so many Hours to the Reading and WritingSchool and in the Evening should practice at least two Hours before Bedtime and two before the Master comes in the Morning This Course held for seven or eight Years will make them fine Proficients but that they should not go too raw or young out of the Academy 'tis proper that at the stated Age of Apprenticeship they be bound to the Hospital to engage their greater Application and make them thorough Masters before they launch out into the World for one great hinderance to many Performers is that they begin to teach too soon and obstruct their Genius  What will not such a Design produce in a few Years will they not be able to perform a Consort Choir or Opera or all three among  themselves and overpay the Charge as shall hereafter be specify'd  For Example we will suppose such a Design to be continued for ten Years we shall find an Orchestre of forty Hands and a Choir or Opera of twenty Voices or admitting that of those twenty only five prove Capital Singers 'twill answer the Intent  For the greater Variety they may if they think fit take in two or more of their Girls where they find a promising Genius but this may be further consider'd of  Now when they are enabled to exhibit an Opera Will they not gain considerably when their Voices and Hands cost them only a College Subsistance And 'tis but reasonable the Profits accruing from Operas Consorts or otherwise should go to the  Hospital  to make good all former and future Expences and enable them to extend the Design to a greater Length and Grandeur so than instead of l  per Ann  the price of one  Italian  Singer we shall for l once in ten Years have sixty  English  Musicians regularly educated and enabled to live by their Science  There ought moreover to be annual Probations and proper Prizes or Premiums alloted to excite Emulation in the Youths and give Life to their Studies  They have already a MusickSchool as they call it but the Allowance is too poor for this Design and the Attendance too small it must be every Day or not at all  This will be an Academy indeed and in Process of Time they will have even their Masters among themselves and what is the Charge compar'd with the Profits or their Abilities  One thing I had like to have forgot which is that with Permission of the Right Reverend the Lords Spiritual some Performance in Musick suitable to the Solemnity of the Day be exhibited every Sunday after Divine Service Sacred Poesy and Rhetorick may be likewise introduc'd to make it an Entertainment suitable to a Christian and Polite Audience and indeed we seem to want some such commendable Employment for the better Sort For we see the publick Walks and Taverns crowded and rather than be idle they will go to  Newport Market  That such an Entertainment would be much preferable to Drinking Gaming or profane Discourse none can deny and till it is proved to be prejudicial I shall always imagine it necessary The Hall at the  Hospital  will contain few less than seven hundred People conveniently seated which at so small a Price as one Shilling  per  Head will amount to l per Week and if the  Performance deserve it as no doubt it will in time they may make it half a Crown or more which must considerably encrease the Income of the  Hospital  When they are able to make an Opera the Profits will be yet more considerable nor will they reap much less from what the Youths bring in during their Apprenticeship when employ'd at Consorts Theatres or other publick Entertainments  Having advanc'd what I think proper on this Head or at least enough for a Hint I proceed to offer  That many Youths and Servants may be sav'd from Destruction were the Streets clear'd of shameless and impudent Strumpets GamingTables totally suppress'd and a stop put to Sabbath Debauches  THE Corruption of our Children and Servants is of Importance sufficient to require our utmost Precaution and moreover Women Servants commonly call'd MaidServants are such necessary Creatures that it is by no means below us  to make them beneficial rather than prejudicial to us  I shall not run into a Description of their Abuses we know enough of those already Our Business now is to make them useful First by ascertaining their Wages at a proper Standard  Secondly by obliging them to continue longer in Service not to stroll about from Place to Place and throw themselves on the Town on every Dislike  Thirdly To prevent their being harbour'd by wicked Persons when out of Place or living too long on their own Hands  As for their Wages they have topp'd upon us already and doubled 'em in spight of our Teeth but as they have had Wit enough to get 'em so will they I doubt not have the same Sense to keep 'em and much Good may it do those indolent oversecure Persons who have given 'em this Advantage However if they are honest and diligent I would have them encourag'd and handsome Wages allow'd 'em because by this Means we provide for the Children of the inferior Class of People who otherwise could not maintain themselves nay sometimes Tradesmen  c  reduced are glad when their Children cease to hang upon them by getting into Service and by that Means not  only maintaining themselves but being of Use in other Families But then there ought to be some Medium some Limitation to their Wages or they may extort more than can well be afforded  Nothing calls more for Redress than their quitting Service for every idle Disgust leaving a Master or Mistress at a Nonplus and all under Plea of a foolish old Custom call'd Warning no where practis'd but in  London  For in other Places they are hir'd by the Year or by the Statute as they call it which settles them in a Place at least for some Time whereas when they are not limited it encourages a roving Temper and makes them never easy  If you turn them away without Warning they will make you pay a Month's Wages be the Provocation or Offence never so great but if they leave you tho' never so abruptly or unprovided help yourselves how you can there is no Redress Tho' I think there ought in all Conscience to be as much Law for the Master as for the Servant  No Servant should quit a Place where they are well fed and paid without assigning a good Reason before a Magistrate On the other Hand they should receive no Abuse which should not be redress'd For we ought to treat 'em as  Servants not Slaves and a Medium ought to be observ'd on both Sides But if they are not restrain'd from quitting Service on every Vagary they will throw themselves on the Town and not only ruin themselves but others For Example a Girl quits a Place and turns Whore if there is not a Bastard to be murder'd or left to the Parish there is One or more unwary Youths drawn in to support her in Lewdness and Idleness in order to which they rob their Parents and Masters nay sometimes any Body else to support their Strumpets so that many Thieves owe their Ruin and shameful Deaths to Harlots Not to mention the Communication of loathsome Distempers and innumerable other Evils to which they give Birth  How many Youths of all Ranks are daily ruin'd And how justly may be dreaded the Loss of as many more if a speedy Stop be not put to this growing Evil Generations to come will curse the Neglect of the present and every Sin committed for the future may be pass'd to our Account if we do not use our Endeavours to the contrary  And unless we prevent our MaidServants from being harbour'd by wicked Persons when out of Place or living too long on their own Hands our Streets will swarm with impudent shameless Strumpets  the Good will be molested those prone to Evil will be made yet more wicked by having Temptations thrown in their Way And to crown all we shall have scarce a Servant left but our Wives  c  must do the Housholdwork themselves  If this be not worthy the Consideration of a Legislature I would fain know what is Is it not Time to limit their Wages when they are grown so wanton they know not what to ask Is it not Time to fix 'em when they stroll from Place to Place and we are hardly sure of a Servant a Month together Is it not Time to prevent the Encrease of Harlots by making it penal for Servants to be harbour'd in Idleness and tempted to Theft Whoredom Murder  c  by living too long out of Place And I am sure it is high Time to begin the Work by clearing the publick Streets of Nightwalkers who are grown to such a Pitch of Impudence that Peace and common Decency are manifestly broken in our publick Streets I wonder this has so long escap'd the Eye of the Magistrate especially when there are already in force Laws sufficient to restrain this Tide of Uncleanness which will one Day overflow us  The lewdest People upon Earth ourselves excepted are not guilty of such open Violations of the Laws of Decency Go all the World over and you'll see no such Impudence as in the Streets of  London  which makes many Foreigners give our Women in general a bad Character from the vile Specimens they meet with from one End of the Town to the other Our SessionsPapers are full of the Triais of impudent Sluts who first decoy Men and then rob 'em A Meanness the Courtesans of  Rome  and  Venice  abhor  How many honest Women those of the Inferior Sort especially get loathsome Distempers from their Husband's Commerce with these Creatures which Distempers are often entail'd on Posterity nor have we an Hospital separated for that Purpose which does not contain too many Instances of honest poor Wretches made miserable by Villains of Husbands  And now I have mentioned the Villainy of some Husbands in the lower State of Life give me leave to propose or at least to wish that they were restrained from abusing their Wives at that barbarous Rate which is now practised by Butchers Carmen and such inferior Sort of Fellows who are publick Nusances to civil Neighbourhoods and yet no Body cares to interpose because the Riot is between a Man and his Wife  I see no Reason why every profligate Fellow shall have the Liberty to disturb a whole Neighbourhood and abuse a poor honest Creature at a most inhuman Rate and is not to be call'd to Account because it is his Wife this sort of Barbarity was never so notorious and so much encourag'd as at present for every Vagabond thinks he may cripple his Wife at pleasure and 'tis enough to pierce a Heart of Stone to see how barbarously some poor Creatures are beaten and abused by merciless Dogs of Husbands  It gives an ill Example to the growing Generation and this Evil will gain Ground on us if not prevented It may be answer'd the Law has already provided Redress and a Woman abus'd may swear the Peace against her Husband but what Woman cares to do that It is revenging herself on herself and not without considerable Charge and Trouble  There ought to be a shorter way and when a Man has beaten his Wife which by the Bye is a most unmanly Action and great Sign of Cowardice it behoves every Neighbour who has the least humanity or Compassion to complain to the next Justice of the Peace who should be impowered to set him in the Stocks for the first Offence to have him well scourg'd at the WhippingPost for the second and  if he persisted in his barbarous Abuse of the holy Marriage State to send him to the House of Correction 'till he should learn to use more Mercy to his Yokefellow  How hard is it for a poor industrious Woman to be up early and late to sit in a cold Shop Stall or Market all Weathers to carry heavy Loads from one End of the Town to the other or to work from Morning till Night and even then dread going Home for fear of being murder'd Some may think this too low a Topic for me to expatiate upon to which I answer that it is a Charitable and a Christian one and therefore not in the least beneath the Consideration of any Man who had a Woman for his Mother  The Mention of this leads me to exclaim against the vile Practice now so much in vogue among the better Sort as they are called but the worst sort in fact namely the sending their Wives to MadHouses at every Whim or Dislike that they may be more secure and undisturb'd in their Debaucheries Which wicked Custom is got to such a Head that the Number of private MadHouses in and about  London  are considerably increased within these few Years  This is the heighth of Barbarity and Injustice in a Christian Country it is a clandestine Inquisition nay worse  How many Ladies and Gentlewomen are hurried away to these Houses which ought to be suppress'd or at least subject to daily Examination as hereafter shall be proposed  How many I say of Beauty Vertue and Fortune are suddenly torn from their dear innocent Babes from the Arms of an unworthy Man who they love perhaps but too well and who in Return for that Love nay probably an ample Fortune and a lovely Offspring besides grows weary of the pure Streams of chaste Love and thirsting after the Puddles of lawless Lust buries his vertuous Wife alive that he may have the greater Freedom with his Mistresses  If they are not mad when they go into these cursed Houses they are soon made so by the barbarous Usage they there suffer and any Woman of Spirit who has the least Love for her Husband or Concern for her Family cannot sit down tamely under a Confinement and Separation the most unaccountable and unreasonable  Is it not enough to make any one mad to be suddenly clap'd up stripp'd whipp'd ill fed and worse us'd To have no Reason assign'd for such Treatment no Crime alledg'd or Accusers to confront And what is worse no Soul to appeal to but merciless Creatures who answer but in Laughter  Surliness Contradiction and too often Stripes  All Conveniences for Writing are denied no Messenger to be had to carry a Letter to any Relation or Friend and if this tyrannical Inquisition join'd with the reasonable Reflections a Woman of any common Understanding must necessarily make be not sufficient to drive any Soul stark staring mad though before they were never so much in their right Senses I have no more to say  When by this Means a wicked Husband has driven a poor Creature mad and rob'd an injur'd Wife of her Reason for 'tis much easier to create than to cure Madness then has the Villain a handle for his Roguery then perhaps he will admit her distressed Relations to see her when 'tis too late to cure the Madness he so artfully and barbarously has procured  But this is not all something more dismal Effects attend this Inquisition for Death is but too often the Cure of their Madness and End of their Sorrows some with ill Usage some with Grief and many with both are barbarously cut off in the Prime of their Years and Flower of their Health who otherwise might have been Mothers of a numerous Issue and surviv'd many Years This is Murder in the deepest Sense and  much more cruel than Dagger or Poison because more lingring they die by Peacemeal and in all the Agonies and Terrors of a distracted Mind  Nay it is Murder upon Murder for the Issue that might have been begot is to be accounted for to God and the Publick Now if this kind of Murder is conniv'd at we shall no doubt have enough nay too much of it for if a Man is weary of his Wife has spent her Fortune and wants another 'tis but sending her to a MadHouse and the Business is done at once  How many have already been murdered after this manner is best known to just Heaven and those unjust Husbands and their damn'd Accomplices who tho' now secure in their Guilt will one Day find 'tis Murder of the blackest Dye has the least claim for Mercy and calls aloud for the severest Vengeance  How many are yet to be sacrificed unless a speedy Stop be put to this most accursed Practice I tremble to think our Legislature cannot take this Cause too soon in hand This surely cannot be below their Notice and 'twill be an easy matter at once to suppress all these pretended MadHouses Indulge gentle Reader for once the doting of an old Man and give him leave to lay down his little System without arraigning him of Arrogance or Ambition  to a be Lawgiver In my humble Opinion all private MadHouses should be suppress'd at once and it should be no less than Felony to confine any Person under pretence of Madness without due Authority  For the cure of those who are really Lunatick licens'd MadHouses should be constituted in convenient Parts of the Town which Houses should be subject to proper Visitation and Inspection nor should any Person be sent to a MadHouse without due Reason Inquiry and Authority  It may be objected by Persons determined to contradict every thing and approve nothing that the Abuses complained of are not so numerous or heinous as I would insinuate Why are not Facts advanced they will be apt say to give a Face of Truth to these Assertions but I have two Reasons to the contrary the first is the more you convince them the more angry you make 'em for they are never better pleased than when they have an Opportunity of finding Fault Therefore to curry Favour with the Faultfinders I have left 'em a loop Hole the second and real is because I don't care to bring an old House over my Head by mentioning particular Names or special Cases thereby drawing my self into vexatious Prosecutions and Suits  at Law from litigious Wretches who would be galled to find their Villainies made publick and stick at no Expence or foul Play to revenge themselves Not but I could bring many Instances particularly of an unhappy Widow put in by a Villain of a Husband and now continued in for the sake of her Jointure by her unnatural Son FAR from common Honesty or Humanity Of another whose Husband keeps his Mistress in black Velvet and is seen with her every Night at the Opera or Play while his poor Wife by much the finer Woman and of an Understanding far superior to her thick Skull'd Tyrant is kept mean in Diet and Apparel nay ill us'd into the Bargain notwithstanding her Fortune supplies all the Villain's Extravagancies and he has not a Shilling but what came from her but a Beggar when once set on Horseback proves always the most unmerciful RIDER  I cannot leave this Subject without inserting one particular Case  A Lady of known Beauty Vertue and Fortune nay more of Wisdom not flashy Wit was in the Prime of her Youth and Beauty and when her Senses were perfectly sound carried by her Husband in his Coach as to the Opera but the Coachman had other Instructions and drove directly to a MadHouse where the poor innocent  Lady was no sooner introduced under pretence of calling by the way to see some Pictures he had a mind to buy but the Key was turn'd upon her and she left a Prisoner by her faithless Husband who while his injur'd Wife was confined and us'd with the utmost Barbarity He like a profligate Wretch ran through her Fortune with Strumpets and then basely under Pretence of giving her Liberty extorted her to make over her Jointure which she had no sooner done but he laugh'd in her Face and left her to be as ill us'd as ever This he soon ran through and happily for the Lady died by the Justice of Heaven in a Salivation his Debauches had oblig'd him to undergo  During her Confinement the Villain of the MadHouse frequently attempted her Chastity and the more she repuls'd him the worse he treated her till at last he drove her mad in good earnest Her distressed Brother who is fond of her to the last Degree now confines her in part of his own House treating her with great Tenderness but has the Mortification to be assured by the ablest Physicians that his poor Sister is irrecoverably distracted  Numberless are the Instances I could produce but they would be accounted fictitious because I don't name the particular Persons for the Reasons before assigned  but the Sufferings of these poor Ladies are not fictitious nor are the Villainy of these MadHouses or the unnatural though fashionable Barbarity of Husbands Chimira's but too solid Grievances and manifest Violations of the Laws of God and Man  Most Gracious and August Queen  Caroline  Ornament of your Sex and Pride of the  British  Nation the best of Mothers the best of Wives the best of Women Begin this Auspicious Reign with an Action worthy your illustrious Self rescue your injur'd Sex from this Tyranny nor let it be in the Power of every brutal Husband to Cage and confine his Wife at pleasure A Practice scarce heard of 'till of late Years Nip it in the Bud most gracious Queen and draw on your self the Blessings of numberless of the fair Sex now groaning under the severest and most unjust Bondage Restore 'em to their Families let 'em by your Means enjoy Light and Liberty That while they fondly embrace and with Tears of Joy weep over their dear Children so long witheld from them they may invoke accumulated Blessings from Heaven upon your Royal Head  And you ye fair illustrious Circle who adorn the  British  Court and every Day surround our gracious Queen Let generous Pity inspire your Souls and move you to  intercede with your noble Consorts for Redress in this injurious Affair Who can deny when you become Suitors and who knows but at your Request a Bill may be brought into the House to regulate these Abuses The Cause is a Noble and a Common one and ought to be espoused by every Lady who would claim the least  to Vertue or Compassion I am sure no  Member in either honourable House will  so reasonable a Bill the Business is for some publick Spirited Patriot to break the Ice by bringing it into the House and I dare lay my Life it passes  I must beg my Reader's Indulgence being the most immethodical Writer imaginable 'tis true I lay down a Scheme but Fancy is so fertile I often start fresh Hints and cannot but pursue 'em pardon therefore kind Reader my digressive way of Writing and let the Subject not the Stile or Method engage thy Attention  Return we therefore to complain of destructive GamingHouses the Bane of our Youth and Ruin of our Children and Servants  This is the most unprofitable Evil upon Earth for it only tends to alienate the proper Current of Specie to maintain a pack of idle sharping Rascals and beggar unwary Gentlemen and Traders  I take the Itch of gaming to be the most pernicious of Vices it is a kind of avaritious Madness and if People have not Sense to command themselves by Reason they ought to be restrained by Law Nor suffered to ruin themselves and Families to enrich a Crew of Sharpers  There is no playing on the Square with these Villains they are sure to cheat you either by slight of Hand Confederacy or false Dice  c  they have so much the Odds of their infatuated Bubbles that they might safely play a Guinea to a Shilling and yet be sure of winning This is but genteel Pocketpicking or Felony with another Name and yet so fond are we of it that from the Footboy to the Lord all must have a touch of gaming and there are Sharpers of different Stations and Denominations from  Southwark Fair  to the  Groom Porters  Shame that Gentlemen should suffer every Scoundrel to mix with them for Gaming sake And equal Shame that honest laborious Tradesmen should be obstructed in crossing the publick Streets by the gilt Chariots of Vagabond Gamesters who now infest the Land and brave even our Nobility and Gentry with their own Money  But the most barbarous Part of this hellish Trade is what they call setting of young Gentlemen Apprentices and  others this ought to be deem'd Felony without Benefit of Clergy for 'tis the worst of Thievery Under Pretence of taking a Bottle or spending an Evening gayly they draw their Cull to the Tavern where they sit not long before the Devil's Bones or Books are found accidentally on purpose by the Help of which they strip my Gentleman in an Instant and then generously lend him his own Money to lose a fresh and create a Debt which is but too often more justly paid than those more justly due  If we look into some late Bankrupcies we shall find some noted Gamesters the principal Creditors I think in such Cases 'twould be but Justice to make void the Gamester's Debt and subject his Estate to make good the Deficiencies of the Bankrupt's Effects If Traders have no more Wit the Publick should have Pity on 'em and make it as penal to lose as to win And in Truth if Cards Dice  c  were totally suppress'd Industry and Arts would encrease the more Gaming may make a Man crafty but not polite one may understand Cards and Dice perfectly well and be a Blockhead in every Thing else  I am sorry to see it so prevalent in the City among the trading Part of Mankind who have introduc'd it into their Clubs and Play so high of late that  many Bankrupts have been made by this pernicious Practice  It is the Bane of all Conversation And those who can't sit an Hour without Gaming should never go into a Club to spoil Company In a Word 'tis mere Madness and a most stupid Thing to hazard ones Fortune and perplex ones Mind nay to sit up whole Nights poring over Toys of pipt Ivory and painted Pasteboard making our selves worse than little Children whose innocent Sports we so much ridicule  To sum up all I think 'twould be a noble Retribution to subject Gamester's Estates to the Use and Support of the poor Widows and Orphans of their unfortunate Bubbles  Sunday  Debauches are Abuses that call loud for Amendment 'Tis in this pernicious Soil the Seeds of Ruin are first sown Instead of a Day of Rest we make it a Day of Labour by toiling in the Devil's Vineyard and but too many surfeit themselves with the Fruits of Gluttony Drunkenness and Uncleanness  Not that I am so superciliously strict to have the Sabbath kept as rigidly here as in  Scotland  but then there ought to be a Medium between the Severity of a Fast and the Riot of  Saturnalia  Instead of a decent and chearful Solemnity our Taverns  and PublickHouses have more Business that Day than all the Week beside Our Apprentices plume themselves nay some scruple not to put on their Swords and Tye Wigs or Toupees and the loose End of the Town is their Rendezvous  Sunday  being MarketDay all round the Hundreds of  Drury  While we want Servants to do our Work those Hundreds as they call 'em are crowded with Numbers of idle impudent Sluts who love Sporting more than Spinning and inveigle our Youth to their Ruin Nay many old Lechers Beasts as they are steal from their Families and seek these Harlot's lurking Holes to practice their unaccountable Schemes of new invented Lewdnesses Some half hang themselves others are whipt some lie under a Table and gnaw the Bones that are thrown 'em while others stand slaving among a Parcel of Drabs at a WashingTub Strange that the Inclination should not die with the Power but that old Fools should make themselves the Prey and Ridicule of a Pack of Strumpets  Some heedless Youths are wheedled into Marriage which makes them and their unhappy Parents miserable all their Lives others are drawn into Extravagancies and but too often run into their Master's Cash  and for fear of a Discovery make away with themselves or at least run away and leave their distracted Parents in a Thousand Fears Not to mention the Frustration of their Fortune and the Miseries that attend a Vagabond Life Thus honest Parents lose their Children and Traders their Apprentices and all from a Liberty we have of late given our Youth of rambling Abroad on  Sundays  For many now adays will lie out all Night or stay out so late to give no small Disturbance in sober Families It therefore behoves every Master of a Family to have his Servants under his Eye And if the going to Church Meeting or whatever Place of Worship suited their Religion were more enforc'd it would be so much the better  In short the Luxury of the Age will be the Ruin of the Nation if not prevented We leave Trade to game in Stocks We live above ourselves and barter our Readymoney for Trifles Tea and Wine are all we seem anxious for and God has given the Blessings of Life to an ungrateful People who despise their own Productions Our very PloughFellows drink Wine now adays Our Farmers Grasiers and Butchers are above MaltLiquors and the wholesome Breakfast of Watergruel and Milkpottage is chang'd for Coffee and Tea This is the Reason  Provisions and Corn  c  are so dear we all work for Vintners and raise our Prices one upon another to such a Degree 'twill be an Impossibility to live and we shall of Course become our own Devourers  We strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel And in this Instance the Publick Houses are kept open to furnish our Luxury while we deny ourselves other Necessaries of Life out of a Scruple of Conscience For Example in extreme hot Weather when Meat will not keep from  Saturday  to  Sunday  we throw or cause to be thrown away vast Quantities of tainted Meat and have generally stinking Dinners because the Butchers dare not sell a Joint of Meat on a  Sunday  Morning Now tho' I would not have the  Sabbath  so far violated as to have it MarketDay yet rather than abuse God's Mercies by throwing away Creatures given for our Use nay for our own Healths and Cleanliness Sake I would have the same Indulgence in extreme hot Weather as there is for Milk and Mackrell that is to say that Meat might be kill'd in the cool of the Morning  viz  One or Two of the Clock and sold 'till Nine and no longer Nor should villainous Informers have Power to molest them in this innocent and reasonable Amendment of a ridiculous vulgar Error  I cannot forbear taking Notice of the extravagant Use or rather Abuse of that nauseous Liquor call'd  GENEVA  among our lower sort Those who deny that an inferior Class of People are most necessary in a Body Politick contradict Reason and Experience itself since they are most useful when Industrious and as pernicious when lazy By their Industry our Manufactures Trade and Commerce are carried on The Merchant in his Compting House and the Captain in his Cabbin would find but little Employment were it not that many Hands carried on the different Branches of the Concern they superintended  But now so far are our common People infatuated with  Geneva  that Half the Work is not done now as formerly It debilitates and enervates them and they are not near so strong and healthy as formerly This accursed Liquor is in itself so diuretick it overstrains the Parts of Generation and makes our common People incapable of getting such lusty Children as they us'd to do Add to this that the Women by drinking it spoil their Milk and by giving it to young Children as they foolishly do spoil the Stomach and hinder Digestion so that in less than an Age we may expect a fine Spindleshank'd Generation  There is not in Nature so unhealthy a Liquor as  Geneva  especially as commonly sold It curdles the Blood it stupifies the Senses it weakens the Nerves it spoils the Eyesight and entirely ruins the Stomach nay some Stomachs have been render'd so cold by the Use of  Geneva  that LampSpirits have not been a Dram warm enough for 'em Surely they will come to drink  Aquafortis  at last  On the contrary our own Malt Liquors especially common Draught Beer is most wholesome and nourishing and has brought up better Generations than the present It is strengthening cooling and balsamick It helps Digestion and carries Nourishment with it And in spight of the Whims of some Physicians is most pertinent to a humane especially a good wholesome  English  Constitution Nay the honest Part of the Faculty deny not the Use of SmallBeer well brew'd even in Fevers I my self have found great Benefit by it and if it be good in its Kind 'tis the finest Julap upon Earth  If this Abuse of  Geneva  be not stopt we may go whoop for Husbandmen Labourers  c  Trade must consequently stand still and the Credit of the Nation sink Nor is the Abatement of the Excise tho' very considerable and most worthy Notice any ways comparable to the Corruption of  Manners the Destruction of Healt  all the Train of Evils we are threaten'd with from pernicious  Geneva  An effectual Method to prevent StreetRobberies  THE principal Encouragements and Opportunity given to StreetRobbers is that our Streets are so poorly watch'd the Watchmen for the most Part being decrepid superannuated Wretches with one Foot in the Grave and the t'other ready to follow so feeble that a Puff of Breath can blow 'em down Poor crazy Mortals Much fitter for an Almshouse than a Watchhouse A City watch'd and guarded by such Animals is wretchedly watch'd indeed  Nay so little Terror do our Watchmen carry with them that hardy Thieves make a mere Jest of 'em and sometimes  even the very Watchmen who should apprehend 'em to light 'em in their Roguery And what can a poor Creature do in Terror of his Life surrounded by a Pack of Ruffians and no Assistance near  Add to this that our Rogues are grown more wicked than ever and Vice in all Kinds is so much wink'd at that Robbery  is accounted a petty Crime We take pains to puff 'em up in their Villainy and Thieves are set out in so amiable a Light in the  Beggar's Opera  that it has taught them to value themselves on their Profession rather than be asham'd of it  There was some Cessation of StreetRobberies from the Time of  Bunworth  and  Blewitt  's Execution 'till the Introduction of this pious Opera Now we find the  Cartouchian  Villainies revived and  London  that us'd to be the most safe and peaceful City in the Universe is now a Scene of Rapine and Danger If some of  Cartouch  's Gang be not come over to instruct our Thieves and propagate their Schemes we have doubtless a  Cartouch  of our own and a Gang which if not suppress'd may be full as pernicious as ever  Cartouch  's was and  London  will be as dangerous as  Paris  if due Care be not taken  We ought to begin our Endeavours to suppress these Villainies first by Heavenly and then by Earthly Means  By Heavenly Means in enforcing and encouraging a Reformation of Manners by suppressing of Vice and Immorality and punishing Prophaneness and Licentiousness Our Youth are corrupted by filthy lewd Ballads sung and sold publickly in our Streets Nay unlicens'd and  stamp'd  notwithstanding Acts of Parliament to the contrary  Coachmen Carmen  c  are indulg'd in Swearing after the most blasphemous shocking and unaccountable Rate that ever was known New Oaths and Blasphemies are daily utter'd and invented and rather than not exercise this hellish Tallent they will vent their Curses on their very Horses and Oh stupid Damn the Blood of a Post rather than want something to curse  Our common Women too have learn'd this Vice and not only Strumpets but labouring Women who keep our Markets and vend Things about Street swear and curse at a most hideous Rate Their Children learn it from the Parents and those of the middle or even the better Sort of People if they pass through the Streets to School or to play catch the Infection and carry home such Words as must consequently be very shocking to sober Parents  Our Youth in general have too much Liberty the Sabbath is not kept with due Solemnity Masters and Mistresses of Families are too remiss in the Care of the Souls committed to their Charge Family Prayer is neglected and to the Shame of Scoffers be it spoken too much ridiculed All Ages and Sexes if in Health should be obliged to attend publick Worship according to their respective Opinions  Were it only to keep Youth out of Harm's Way it would do well But it is to be hoped if their Parents Masters or Mistresses should oblige their Attendance at publick Devotion they would edify by what they should hear and many wicked Acts would be stifled in their Infancy and check'd even in the Intention by good and useful Doctrine  Our common People make it a Day of Debauch and get so drunk on a Sunday they cannot work for a Day or two following Nay since the Use of Geneva has become so common many get so often drunk they cannot work at all but run from one Irregularity to another 'till at last they become arrant Rogues And this is the Foundation of all our present Complaints  We will suppose a Man able to maintain himself and Family by his Trade and at the same Time to be a Genevadrinker This Fellow first makes himself incapable of working by being continually drunk this runs him behindhand and he either pawns or neglects his Work for which Reason no Body will employ him At last Fear of Arrests his own Hunger the Cries of his Family for Bread his natural Desire to support an irregular Life and a propense Hatred to Labour turn but too many an honest Tradesman into  an arrant desperate Rogue And these are commonly the Means that furnish us with Thieves and Villains in general  Thus is a Man that might be useful in a Body politick render'd obnoxious to the same And if this Trade of Wickedness goes on they will grow and encrease upon us insomuch that we shall not dare to stir out of our Habitations nay it will be well if they arrive not to the Impudence of plundering our Houses at Noon day  Where is the Courage of the  English  Nation that a Gentleman with Six or Seven Servants shall be robb'd by one single Highwayman Yet we have lately had Instances of this and for this we may thank our Effeminacy our Toupee Wigs and powder'd Pates our Tea and other scandalous Fopperies and above all the Disuse of noble and manly Sports so necessary to a brave People once in Vogue but now totally lost among us  Let not the Reader think I run from my Subject if I search the Bottom of the Distemper before I propose a Cure which having done tho' indeed but slightly for this is an Argument could be carried to a much greater Length I proceed next to propose Earthly Means in the Manner following  Let the Watch be composed of stout able bodied Men and of those at least treble the Number now subsisting that is to say a Watchman to every Forty Houses Twenty on one Side of the Way and Twenty on the other for it is observable that a Man cannot well see distinctly beyond the Extent of Twenty Houses in a Row if 'tis a single Row and no opposite Houses the Charge must be greater and their Safety less This Man should be elected and paid by the Housekeepers themselves to prevent Misapplication and Abuse so much complain'd of in the Distribution of Publick Money  He should be allow'd  s per Annum  by each Housekeeper which at Forty Houses as above specify'd amounts to  l per Annum  almost treble to what is at present allow'd and yet most Housekeepers are charg'd at least  s    d  a Quarter to the Watch whose beat is generally speaking little less than the Compass of half a Mile  This Salary is something of Encouragement and a pretty Settlement to a poor Man who with Frugality may live decently thereon and by due Rest be enabled to give vigilant Attendance  If a Housekeeper break or a House is empty the poor Watchman ought not to  suffer the Deficiency should be made up by the Housekeepers remaining  Or indeed all Housekeepers might be excus'd if a Tax of only  s per Annum  were levied on every Batchelor within the Bills of Mortality and above the Age of One and Twenty who is not a Housekeeper for these young Sparks are a Kind of unprofitable Gentry to the State they claim publick Safety and Advantages and yet pay nothing to the Publick nay indeed they in a Manner live upon the Publick for on a  Sunday  especially at least a Million of these Gentlemen quarter themselves upon the married Men and rob many Families of part of a Week's Provision more particularly when they play a good Knife and Fork and are of the Family of the  Tuckers  I beg Pardon for this whimsical Proposal which ludicrous as it seems has something in it and may be improved Return we in the mean Time to our Subject  The Watch thus station'd strengthen'd and encourag'd let every Watchman be arm'd with FireArms and Sword and let no Watchman stand above Twenty Doors distant from his Fellow  Let each Watchman be provided with a BugleHorn to sound on Alarm or in Time of Danger and let it be made penal  if not Felony for any but a Watchman to sound a Horn in and about the City from the Time of their going on to that of their going off  An Objection will be here made on Account of the PostBoys to obviate which I had Thoughts of a Bell but that would be too ponderous and troublesome for a Watchman to carry besides his Arms and Lanthorn As to a fix'd Bell if the Watchman is at another Part of his Walk how can he give Notice Besides Rogues may play Tricks with the Bell whereas a Horn is portable always ready and most alarming  Let the PostBoys therefore use some other Signal since this is most convenient to this more material Purpose They may carry a Bell in a Holster with Ease and give Notice by that as well as those who collect the Letters  That the Watchmen may see from one End of their Walks to the other let a convenient Number of Lamps be set up and those not of the Convex Kind which blind the Eyes and are of no manner of Use they dazzle but give no distinct Light And farther rather than prevent Robberies Many deceiv'd and blinded by these  Ignes fatui  have been run over by Coaches Carts  c  People stumble more upon one another even under these  very Lamps than in the Dark In short they are most unprofitable Lights and in my Opinion rather Abuses than Benefits  Besides I see no Reason why every Ten Housekeepers can't find a Lamp among themselves and let their Watchman dress it rather than fatten a crew of Directors But we are so fond of Companies 'tis a Wonder we have not our Shooes black'd by one and a Set of Directors made rich at the Expence of our very Blackguards Convenient Turnpikes and Stoppages may be made to prevent Escapes and it will be proper for a Watchman to be plac'd at one of these fix'd at the End of a Lane Court Alley or other Thoroughfare which may happen in any Part of his Beat and so as not to obstruct his View to both Ends thereof or being able to give Notice as aforesaid for the Watch ought to be in View as well as in the Hearing of each other or they may be overpower'd and much Danger may happen  The Streets thus guarded and illuminated what remains but that the Money allotted by the Government be instantly paid on Conviction of every Offender for Delays in this Case are of dangerous Consequence and no Body will venture their Lives in Hopes of a Reward if it  be not duly and timely paid If there is Reason of Complaint on this Head it ought to be look'd into by those at the Helm for nothing can be more vile than for Underlings to abuse the Benevolence of the Publick or their Superiors by sinking abridging or delaying publick or private Benefits And it is by no Means below the Dignity or Care even of the greatest to see the Disposal of their own Bounty and Charity for it loses but too often by the Carriage And where a Nobleman or other generous Person has order'd Five Guineas to be given 'tis well if the proper Object has had even One  Something allow'd by the Chamber of  London  to every Person apprehending a Robber would have a good Effect especially if it be not told over a Gridiron but paid without Delay or Abatement And what if the fewer Custards are eat so it augment the Publick Safety  Some of our common Soldiery are and I hope unjustly suspected This may be easily confuted if strict Orders are enforc'd that none but Commission or Warrant Officers shall be out of their Quarters after Ten at Night But if we consider that neither  Blewit Bunworth  or their Gangs were Soldiers and that of those who have been executed for Ten Years past not One in Ten were Soldiers  but on the contrary Seamen discharg'd and thrown on the Publick without present Subsistence which made them desperate But I hope the Act now depending for the Encouragement of Seamen  c  will sufficiently remove that Obstacle also This I hope will stop the Mouths of censorious Persons who unjustly arraign our Soldiery for the Vices of others However to make all easy I believe the Generality of them will gladly submit to the Restraint propos'd merely to show their Innocence  Mean Time would his most sacred Majesty let them partake of his Bounty as the Officers  c  have done and raise their Pay were it but One Penny  per Diem  it would be a most Royal Bounty would considerably contribute to their Support and put them above any sordid Views And there was never more Occasion than now when Provisions of all Kinds are so excessive dear  Having offer'd my little Mite to the Publick I beg they will excuse the Deficiency of my Stile and Multitude of my Errors for my Intention's Sake I write without Prospect of Gain If I am censured 'tis what I can but expect but if among all my Schemes One proves of Service my Desires and Labours are amply answer'd  OMISSIONS  IN my Scheme for an University in  London  I proposed only a Hall or publick Room on Recollection I find it should be a large House or Inn in the Nature of a College with store of convenient Rooms for Gentlemen not only to study separately but wherein to lodge their Books for 'twould be most inconvenient to lug them backwards and forwards They may indeed Breakfast Sup and Sleep at Home but 'twill be highly necessary they should dine in Commons or at least near the College not that I would have Cooks Butlers Caterers Manciples and the whole Train of College Cannibals retained but for fear they should stay too long at Home or be hindred from returning to Study in due time some proper Place or Person might be pitch'd upon to keep an Ordinary at a prefix'd Price and Hour and for the Students only  My Reasons are these  First A young Gentleman may live too far from College  Second The College Hours for Dinner may not agree with those of the Family  Third Company may drop in and detain him  These being I think the only material Objections could be offered I hope I have amply provided against them and rendered my Project more perfect and unexceptionable  One Omission I made in the Discourse on MadHouses  c  is that Maiden Ladies as well as Widows and Wives are liable to the Inquisition there complained of and I am inform'd a good Estate is lately come to a worthless Family by the Death or rather Murder of an innocent young Creature who being left very rich chose to live with her Friends but well had it been for her had she taken up her Abode among Strangers for they stay'd off all Proposals for Marriage a considerable time and when at last they found the Lady would not be hindered from altering her Condition she was hurried away to a MadHouse where she miserably ended her Days while they rioted in the Pillage of her Fortune Thus neither Maid Wife or Widdow are safe while these accursed MadHouses are suffered Nay I see no Reason if the Age improves in Wickedness as in all Probability it may but the Men  per Contra  may take their Turns Younger Brothers  c  may clap  up their Elders and jump into their Estates for there are no Questions ask'd at these MadHouses but who is the Paymaster and how much give them but their Price mad or not mad 'tis no matter whom they confine so that if any Person lives longer than his Relations think convenient they know their Remedy 'tis but sending them to a MadHouse and the Estate's their own  Having answer'd all that I think liable to Objection and recollected what I had omitted I desire to stand or fall by the Judgment of the serious Part of Mankind wherein they shall correct me I will kiss the Rod and suffer with Patience but if a pack of Hackney Scriblers shall attack me only by way of a getPenny I shall not be provoked to answer them be they never so scurrilous lest I be accounted as one of them  TO LieutenantColonel  Samuel Robinson  SIR  I Shall congratulate you on your Election into the Chamberlainship of the City of  London  or otherwise as you shall acquit your self in answering candidly and impartially to the following Queries  I Whether there is not Money sufficient in the Chamber of  London  to pay off the Orphan's Fund Or if not a sufficient Sum What Sum it is and what is the Deficiency How long it has lain there and what Interest has been made upon it  II If there are not considerable Arrears due from many Wards and what those Arrears are  III Who are these poor Orphans we pay so much Money to And whether they are not some of the richest Men in the City of  London  who have got the Stock into their own Hands and find it so snug a Fund they do not care to get out of it  IV If it would not be much better to gather in the Arrears join 'em to the Money in the Office and collect the Overplus at once rather than suffer the Tax to become eternal and to pay so much Interest  This is but a reasonable Request and if Col  Robinson  is the honest Gentleman Fame reports him to be he will make no Scruple to give a ready Answer And indeed it will be but a handsome Return made to his Fellow Citizens for their Choice of him to begin his Office with such an Act of Justice Honesty and publick Satisfaction For many People don't know what is meant by the Orphan's Tax They pay it with Remorse and think themselves aggrieved Even those who know the Reason of the Fund think it has been continued long enough wish it were once paid off suspect some Secret in the Affair and give their Tongues the Liberty all Losers claim  Our Fathers  say they  have eaten four Grapes and our Teeth are set on Edge we are visited for their Transgressions and may be to the World's  End unless we find an honest Chamberlain who will unveil this cloudy Affair and give us a Prospect of Relief  Thus Sir it lies at your Door to gain the Applause of the whole City a few Misers excepted by a generous and Gentlemanlike Discovery of this Affair And you are thus publickly call'd upon that your Discovery may be as publick and beneficial to all If you comply I shall think you an honest Man above a Fellowfeeling or being byass'd and most worthy your Office If not give me Leave to think the Citizens of  London  have made but an indifferent Choice I am  SIR  Yours as you prove yourself  February  FINIS
