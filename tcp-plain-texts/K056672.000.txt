 AN ESSAY ON THE Treaty of Commerce WITH FRANCE With necessary EXPOSITIONS  PROV xviii  He that Judgeth a Matter before he Heareth it 'tis Folly and Shame unto him  LONDON  Print for J BAKER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price  d    AN ESSAY ON THE Treaty of Commerce WITH FRANCE  c  IT is in vain to make Complaints of the Iniquity of the Times and make a long Introduction to blame the People for the Humour that at present like a Contagion infects the Nation and spreads it self Universally into all Conversation  viz  of finding Fault with and Condemning every publick Transaction before they Weigh or Consider the Reason and Nature of the thing It is enough to sit down and look on it with regret and with a just Pity for the Distempers of our Native Country apply suitable Remedies for the use of such as are not Incurable and  for the opening the Eyes of those who are not wilfully and resolutely blind leaving the rest as the Parishes used to do Houses shut up with the Plague to their own Fate with  Lord ha' Mercy and a Cross  set upon the Door  The Treaty of Commerce made with  France  is the present Subject of every Man's Discourse and it were to be wished People came to the Reading it with less resolution to Dislike it beforehand than they do or at least with a just resolution to Read and Consider it before they passed their judgment for or against but since that cannot be hoped for in this Age it may not be a useless endeavour to open the Eyes of some misguided mistaken People about such things in the said Treaty which they may either on one side or other Causelesly Condemn or too easily approve That things being set in a true light every Man may Reason with himself calmly of this matter for certainly a thing of this Consequence ought to be Duly weigh'd and Cooly Debated before we come to make such Conclusions as are to Determine our judgments both of the Treaty made and of those that made it  To Do this as it ought to be done it seems needful to enquire a little into the  state of our Commerce with  France  before the War began that People may a little know upon what Foundation things formerly stood and may accordingly judge whether we are better or worse than we were before  We are told in the Treaty of a General TARIF that is an Act of Trade made in the Year by the  French  by this some People understand a Treaty of Commerce formerly made between  England  and  France  which is a general mistake and which mistake ought to be set right the Words themselves explain it  a Tarif made in  France  the Treaty by which is to be understood a Table or Decree of the several Impositions and Prohibitions made by the King of  France  for the Regulation of his own Subjects declaring what Goods shall be Imported into  France  and from what Countries and what shall not be Imported and what Customs or Duties shall be paid in  France  upon those Goods which are allow'd to be Imported something like our act of Navigation allowing for the difference of the Subject only  When the  Dutch  have entred into any Treaty of Commerce with  they have grounded those Treaties with re  pect  to their Liberty of Trading into  France  upon that Tarif of  that is to say  They have declared themselves Content with those Conditions of Trade and have only Articled that they should not be otherwise obstructed and therefore we found that in all the Transactions at  Ʋtrecht  when the  Dutch  were Insisting on the particulars of their Trade to  France  it was call'd  The  French  granting  them the Tarif of that is  granting  that no other Impositions or Prohibitions should be laid upon them in  France  than that Act of Trade had formerly laid  Pursuant to this Notion we never find any of our former Treaties with  France  make the least mention of these things since admitting or not admitting the Importation of Goods and Merchandizes into a Kingdom is the undoubted Property and Right of the Sovereign Power or Government of that Kingdom much more the determining what Duties Payments or Impositions shall be charged upon the respective Goods brought in which Payments and Duties being paid by the People of the said Nation who Import no other Nation can Object against them  And therefore we find in all our former Treaties nothing of this nature has  been entred into at all The first Treaty of Peace between  England  and  France  after the Restoration was the Treaty of  Breda    Anno  wherein all that is said of this matter is in the Fourth Article thus  "Navigation and Commerce shall be Free between the Subjects of both the Kings as it was during the Peace insomuch that all of them may Freely and without any Molestation go with their Goods into each others Kingdoms Provinces Places of Commerce Ports Rivers and there stay and Traffick"  Vide  Treaty of  Breda  In the  Feburary  following there was a Treaty between  England  and  France  concluded at St  Germans on Lay  the late Duke of  Montague  being then the  English  Ambassador in  France  and this is call'd a Treaty of Commerce yet from one end to the other there is not one Word mention'd in it of the Duties paid or to be paid in either Kingdom by the Merchants as what really was the peculiar of every Prince or Sovereign Power in their respective Dominions and therefore tho' this Treaty is called a Treaty of Commerce it ought rather to have been call'd a Treaty of Navigation every Article therein respecting the Navigation of Ships Freedom of Ports Visiting Ships  adjustitg what are and what are not Contraband Goods Terminating Differences about Passports detaining Vessels  c  what Goods are liable to Forfeiture and how to be Seiz'd and the like but not a Word about Tolls Customs Duties  c  upon Importation  The next Treaty was that of  Nimeguen  where the  Dutch  were only immediately concern'd and a Treaty of Commerce was likewise settled then between  France  and  Holland    Anno  but even in this Treaty we have not a Word relating to what Duties or Imposits the  French  should lay upon Goods Imported into  France  except as follows  "Neither Party shall be permitted to grant to their own Subjects any Immunities Benefits Gratuitous Concessions or any other Advantages besides those granted to the Subjects of the other Party or to their prejudice neither shall the Subjects on either side be bound to pay greater or other Duties Charges Payments or Impostions whatsoever upon their Persons Goods Wares Ships or Freights directly or indirectly by any Name or under any Title or Pretence whatsoever other than such as shall be paid by the  proper and natural Subjects of either Party"  Vide Treaty of Commerce at  Nimeguen  Article  The only Remedy in all these Cases that has been used by these several Nations has been that wh  laid high Duties upon the Goods imported or Ships Importing from another or Prohibited the Importing  and such Goods or stop'd Trade with the other the other Nation con  the like and these Impositio  s  and Interruptions of Commerce were generally taken off at the concluding a Peace tho' not always  Thus when the  French  after their Tarif of laid a Duty of F  ty  Sols per  Tun upon all Shipping that came into their Harbours it was  highly by all the Trading part of  Europe  the  Danes  and  Sweedes  were very uneasy at it their Ships being large and the Loading such as Timber  boards Planks Baulks Spars  c  being of but little value it went  nto the Freight but they were of too small Consquence to obtain any A  eration in  France  The design of the  French  King being Really very justifiable  difference to encourage    to build Ships of their own and fetch the Goods themselves in which Case they went Free The  Dutch  sollicited eagerly to be exempted from this Duty the Trade they had with  France  being very great and carried on wholly in their own Shipping but they were so far from obtaining an Exemption that in the Treaty of  Nimeguen  the  Dutch  by a separate Article consented to pay that Duty of Fifty  Sols per  Tun as follows  'It hath been stipulated on the behalf of his most Christian Majesty and consented to by the Lords the StatesGeneral of the United Provinces of the  LowCountries  That the Equality which is precisely to be observ'd with relation to the Subjects of each and the Natives as to Duties Charges and Impositions according to the Seventh Article of Treaty of Commerce this Day concluded shall not derogate from the Imposition of Fifty  Sols per  Tun Imposed in  France  upon Strangers Ships and that the Subjects of the Lords the StatesGeneral of the United Provinces of the  LowCountries  shall be bound to pay the same as other Strangers'  Vide Treaty of  Nimeguen  separate Article  The  English  were as much concern'd in this Imposition of Fifty  Sols per  Tun as any Nation the  Dutch  excepted but seeing no just Foundation to object against the reasonableness of the  French  laying such an Imposition and having by their own Act called  The Act of Navigation  done almost the same thing or in effect worse they contented themselves with laying a like Duty of  s per  Tun upon all  French  Ships which should Lade in the several Ports of  England  and so it has rested till this time  The next Treaty of Peace was at  Ryswick  and in this  England  made no Treaty of Commerce at all It was indeed Verbally agreed that Commissioners should be appointed to meet afterwards to enter into a Treaty of Commerce and to settle the Trade between the two Nations But as  France  did not seek it and  England  thought they had no occasion for it the War also being very quickly renewed that Proposal vanished  Now to make way a little to the explaining the present Article of Commerce in debate it may not be amiss to enquire Why  England  was so indifferent at the late Treaty at  Ryswick  whether they entred into a Treaty of Commerce with  France  or no And if this thing be rightly Understood  it will open the Eyes of many if not of every considering Person to the Justice nay to the Advantage to  England  by the present Article of the Treaty of Commerce now made which so many complain of and so few understand  It is too well known to need any Debate that  England  had for many Years we may say Ages carried on the Trade with  France  with manifest disadvantages That by the prodigious quantity of Wines Brandies Silks Linnen Paper Glass and other Goods which we greedlly Imported into  England  from  France  the Ballance of Trade went against us to a very great yearly Sum  France  having used many ways to encourage the Industry of their own People in Woollen Manufactures there in order to lessen as much as might be the demand they might make from  England  When the War interven'd  England  by  veral Acts of Parliament laid Excessive high Duties upon some of the Goods usually Imported from  France  especially Wine and Brandy and others were entirely prohibited to encourage the  English  to pursue with Success the Attempts they had made of setting up the  Manufactures in  England  such as Paper GlassWares Hats Linnen  Wrought Silks and the like these high Duties and Prohibitions remain'd in Force even when the War was at end nor did the restoring of Commerce in general Terms by the Treaty of  Ryswick  alter the Case at all  It came immediately into Debate among the Men of Trade Whether the  French  Trade was worth so much to us as to make it worth while to open it at the Expence of taking off those high Duties and Prohibitions or no And it appeared so evident that it was absolutely necessary to keep on the high Duties as well to encourage the Trade to  Portugal  from whence all our Wines came in return for Woollen Manufactures as also to prevent the excessive Flux of  French  Wine and Brandy to the overballancing the Trade to  France  as also to support our several Manufactures of Silk Glass Paper Wrought Linnen Iron  c  in which we began to Improve so as to be likely in time not to want any or those Goods from  France  I say this appeared so evident that no Man c  uld think with any Patience of entring into any Treaty of Commerce with  France  but every one was convinc'd that it was necessary to keep on the high Duties  to give the Advantage to the other Trades above  named and keep the  French  Trade under foot  Upon these accounts it was that no Treaty ever came to any head with  France  notwithstanding Peace was made for the regulation of Commerce and it was apparent that  England  was in the right of it at that time for that in that Interval of time from the Peace of  Reswick  to the Commencement of the last War the  French  bought exceeding Great Quantities of Goods from us while we on the contrary took but very few Goods of them in Return and the Ballance of Trade was turn'd against  France  This the  French  King was so sensible of That to give his People the Equivalent he made a new Tarif or Settlement of Duties and Customs of Goods  Anno  the same which is now mentioned in the th Article of the present Treaty by which some Goods he entirely Prohibited from  England    viz  Red Herrings which when some of his own Merchants Petitioned against he answered wisely  Is not the Sea open If my Subjects want Herrings let them Catch them not Buy them of others  Upon other Goods from  England  he laid higher Duties than before especially our Woollen Manufactures supposing two things That  it would encourage his own People to make them at Home and might lead the  English  to open the Trade for  French  Wines and Brandies in order to make way for the Trade of the Woollen Manufactures again into  France  But this had no effect here for the Government here who easily foresaw that the Trade of our Woollen Manufactures in  France  was never equal to their Trade of Wine and Brandy here and that the Channel of Trade was Happily turn'd to our Advantage against  France  were far from enclining to alter it and thus the Notion of a Treaty of Commerce was slighted as a thing  France  might desire indeed but we were better without than with And this was the true Reason why it never came to a head  Upon renewing the War New Prohibitions of Commerce on both sides follow'd of Course and to prevent the Wine Trade falling in by private Methods such as Confiscation Prizetaking and the like under which Heads while the Duties were low great quantities of  French  Wine was dayly brought a new Duty additional to the former was lay'd upon Wine and Brandy particularly  per  Ton upon the Wine and  per  Ton upon the Brandy which amounted to a meer Prohibition  except for a very small quantity so great an Advance of the Price reducing the Consumption to almost nothing and the  Portugal  Wines a very profitable Trade to  England  became our general Draught all over  England  This is the true state of the Affair of Commerce between  England  and  France  and thus Her Majesty found things when her Ministers came at  Ʋtrecht  to Treat of the Settling a New Treaty of Commerce and from Hence it will appear that the Measures taken in the said Treaty and the Conditions agreed on relating to our Manufactures in  France  and their Wine and Brandy in  GreatBritain  and taking off the Duty on either side are not only equal and just but are founded on the True Interest of Trade and much more to the advantage of  Britain  than of  France  as will appear if the following Particulars are Impartially Considered  Upon this New Treaty after having in General Agreed in the th Article thus That  the Subjects of each Party shall Pay the Tolls Customs and Duties of Import and Export through all the Dminions and Provinces of either Party as are Due and Accustomed  That is as the Government of that respective Country shall Exact or legally Impose And again in the th Article  'That  Subjects of each of their Royal Majesties may have Leave and Licence to come with their Ships as also with the Merchandizes and Goods on Board the same the Trade and Importation where  are not prohibited by the Laws of either Kingdom to the Lands Countries Cities Ports Places and Rivers of either side'  This again allows that either Nation may Make and Continue such Prohibitions of Trade as they think fit without any Infringement of the Peace Indeed the Nature of the Thing implies that they should and ought to do so for every Country is judge for themselves what it is they ought to Admit and what to Prohibit  The Ministers of  England  then finding the High Duties necessary to be Continued upon Wine and Brandy at least to a certain Degree as well to support the Appropriations of those Duties as to prevent the Ruin of our Trade and also Considering that those Duties being laid by Parliament could not be taken off but by Parliament and that therefore the Plenipotentiaries could not positively agree to take off what their Principals had no Dispensing Power to Direct Our said Ministers abroad  I say  could not therefore reasonably yield to the taking off those Duties by an absolute Concession And as it could not be expected on the other hand that the  French  would without such a Concession take off the Duties they had laid on our Goods and leave the Duties we had laid upon theirs to be paid there appeared but one Expedient for settling this which is contain'd in the th Article  viz  That when the Parliament and Government of  England  shall agree to take off the high Duties in  England  then the  French  shall take off their Duties upon our Goods in  France  The Ballance of Equallity in which is evedently given to  Great Britain  in that the  French  are bound and the Choice is given to  England  whether to take off their Duties and open the Trade or let it remain as it is  I can see no Objection that lies against this Article but what is founded upon those unreasonable Peoples Notions who expect the  French  to give up all Conditions of Trade to us and that we at the same time should absolutely tye up our Trade from them and since the Advantage of the Trade as it now stands lyes manifestly against the  French  the leaving this Article to our own Choice to Deliberate  upon and Determine as we shall find Cause is a tacit preserving in our own Hands those Advantages as long as we shall think fit which is a kind of Advance made upon the  French  that they have very seldome been found to admit and had any such Advantage been given on our side some People would have vallued themselves very much upon taking hold of it against the Prudence or Fidelity of those who Managed the Treaty  I shall return to this Head again after a brief Examination of some Clauses in Commerce which are settled by this Treaty particularly to the advantage of the  British  Trade and which no Treaty before this ever either obtain'd or so much as offer'd at Not that th  is spoken of as a Ballance to any thing yielded up by our Ministers for it do  s not appear that any thing is so yielded up o  that it is expected those who Compl  in in General Terms should be Answer'd and Silenc'd by such Particulars but it may be needful to remind some People more Reasonable than others how far the Interests of the Commerce of  Britain  are really secured by this Treaty and what Advantages in Trade are obtain'd by this Treaty which  never were obtain'd before  For Example  The Imposition of  Sols per  Ton is here expresly agreed to be quitted in  France  to all Her Majesty's Ships It is true we quit at the same time the  s per  Ton on  French  Ships but whoever pleases to Calculate the Number of Ships Trading from each Kingdom respectively will allow there is no Comparison to be made and tho' we contented our selves as is noted before with laying that Duty of  s per  Ton upon  French  Shipping as a Return for their Tax of  Sols per  Ton it was because it was a Duty of the same kind with the other rather than that it was any way Proportion'd in the Collection and therefore when the  French  take of their  Sols per  Ton for your  s per  Ton they give you  s  for every  s  you give them  The Liberty of Importing Cured or Salted Fish into  France  is a Point in Trade Gain'd m  rly by this Treaty and which as I noted before after the Peace at  Reswick  was absolutely Prohibited in  France  and upon the best Reasons turning the Tables and making  their  side  our own  that could be imagined  viz    to Encourage his own Subjects to Fish for themselves which is many ways an Advantage to the  French  more than to other Nations especially in the Breeding and Encreasing their Seamen a thing they so greatly want This Trade by the d Article of the Appendix to the Treaty is to be admitted being only referr'd to the Discussion of Commissioners whether it shall pay according to the Rule of the Tarif of or of  Liberty of Religion comes in as an Addition to this Treaty and which I do not observe to be mentioned in any of the former Treaties occasion'd I suppose by an Edict of the King of  France  past and published in whe  in no Merchant Strangers were allow'd to  in  France  without Conforming to the Popish Church whereas now every Protestant is at liberty to pursue the Dictates of his own Conscience as by the th Article thus  "But in the Businness of Religion there shall be an entire Liberty allow'd to the Subjects of each of the Confederates as also if they are married to their Wives and Children neither shall they be compell'd to go to the Churches or be present at the Religious Worship in any other Place On  the contrary they may without any kind of mollestation perform their Religious Excercises after their own way altho' it be forbid by the Laws of the Kingdom Privately and within their own Walls and without the admittance of any other Persons whatsoever"  Vide the Treaty  P  Article    I might enlarge on the justice of this Article and the Consequences which omitting it might have brought to this Nation but being principally engaged here in matters relating to Commerce I purposely omit it for the present  The Fourth Article  viz  for the Freedom and Equality of Importing  Virginia  Tobacco into  France  seems to be very considerable and especially upon two Accounts or in two Cases in which  England  has been and might be under especial disadvantages in the Tobacco Trade in  France  which Trade as it is Improving in  France  is of the last Consequence to  England  to preserve and if possible to Improve it that Trade being at this time in the greatest danger imaginable of being utterly lost to this Nation as to that part of it especially which is Exported again to other Countries  The two Heads of this Article relate to the selling it into  France  to understand which more especially it is to be observ'd that there is a certain set of Men who have engrossed  as we would call it here  the Privilege or obtain'd a Patent from the King  to use our own Words again  for the sole Liberty of Importing Tobacco Again by another Edict no Stranger can be allowed to Sell or Import any Tobacco but it must be done by such and such so that whoever brings any Tobacco into  France  is obliged to sell it to these Men or have it seized and give it to them for nothing which he pleases Now this Monopoly is put to an end and the Subjects of the Queen of  Great Britain  may Import and Sell their own Tobacco to whom they please and for the best price they can and in one of the Articles not yet adjusted it is demanded by our Ambassadors That the letting out the Duties of Tobacco to Farmers shall wholly cease The other Article relating to the Trade of Tobacco is that  Tobacco Imported into  France  from  England  shall pay the same Duties and no other as the Tobacco of any Country in  Europe  or  America  being brought into  France  does or shall pay    this I mention because of the loud Complaints that some People make of the great probability nay certainty that after the Peace  France  and  Spain  would give and take reciprocally such Advantages in Trade to and from each other as should be very much to the detriment of  England  and to the Advantage of  France  in matters of Commerce Now as it is manifest that in the Article of Tobacco especially Tobacco prepared as for Snuff  c Spain  has great quantities brought Home yearly from  America  and that it would be much for the Advantage of  Spain  to have the same Imported upon easy and good terms into  France  yet that by this Treaty  France  obliges her self to give neither  Spain  or any other Nation any advantage over the  English  in the Trade of Tobacco  Nor is this an Inconsiderable Article  France  being lately come into the Custom of Smoaking Tobacco and which  England  can supply placing the Goodness against the Price Cheaper and Better than any Nation in the World also the Encroachments upon the  Virginia  Trade which have happen'd in these few years being considred together with the discouragements which the  Virginia  Merchants have of  late met with this  Article  is of very great Consequence to them and may help to save that sinking Trade from final Ruin till some other Methods may be found out which may restore and revive it some other way  As to the rest of the Articles of this Treaty as they are the same  Mutalis Mutandis  with the other Treaties of the same kind either made by  England  or by other Nations with the  French  there needs no other Remark to be made nor can any Objection lye against them the usual Forms being Calculated for the Security of Commerce and Navigation I shall therefore return to the said Ninth Article in which all that can reasonably be objected against in the whole Treaty seems to be contain'd and here it may be enquir'd what the real Objections that our People pretend to make are and to what they tend for till this is known it will be very difficult to know what part of it wants explanation  The first thing which I meet with is That our high Duties and Impositions as well as Prohibitions upon the Growth and Manufactures of  France  are demanded to be taken off and those Duties reduc'd to an equality with the Duties on the like  Goods brought into  Great Britain  from other Parts  This it is alledged cannot be done Because it is expresly stipulated against in our Treaty with  Portugal  Because it would Ruin our Wine Trade to other Countries Because it would overrun our whole Trade and turn the ballance against us again as it was before in favour of  France  The short Answer to this without any Circumlocutions is  Then    can't you refuse it and not take those Duties off  But then say Objectors You cannot have the free Export of your Manufactures into  France  to which the Answer is also direct you must do without that too And what then  Why then    You will have as free an Export as you had before the War  You had better be without that free Export if the equivalent which you are to give for it would Ruin your Trade But let us enquire into the thing  I say  You will have as free an Export as what you had before the War  this has some things in it which would a little reflect upon the Prudence and Judgment  of some People and for that Reason I shall mention them very cautiously You will have the same Liberty of Trade which you had after the Treaty of  Ryswick  and which then was not complain'd of at all If as some alledge the  French  are so fallen upon making the Woollen Manufactures of  England  that they are in a Condition to supply  Spain  What need have we to insist so much and at so great a Price upon the Liberty of sending our Manufactures to them who can have no occasion for them being able to supply themselves and other Nations also But to pursue this Argument would seem Inviduous this Paper has no such Design the present Argument extends thus far only The State of the Case between the  English  and the  French  Trade is such That no other Conclusion could possibly be made in the particular Article of the respective Duties Our Ministers if they had been willing could not have conceded the high Duties laid here to the  French  because they could not repeal Acts of Parliament Some of the Prohibitions laid on  French  Goods are so essential to the encouraging the like Manufactures here that it could by no means be thought of at least till it was  laid before the Parliament by whom these Encouragements and Acts of Parliament were Granted and Made On the other Hand How could it be asked of any Nation to open their Doors to our Trade and agree that we should shut our Doors against theirs And yet even in that Case the Treaty as it stands has  as is said above  actually done so in some Particulars for whereas not the least Farthing is abated by the Treaty on our side the  French  in the several Articles mentioned before have actually receeded from several things on their side as the Fifty  Sols per  Ton upon Ships the M  nopoly of Tobacco the admitting Fish in Ba  rels that is  Herring  and  Salmon  which they had prohibited before All this is done on their Side without the least Concession on our Side but all that is offered on our Side is left to the Parliament to determine whether they will come into it or no  If the Equivalent which you are to grant in Lieu of the  French  Trade be too great if it be ruinous to our Trade we had better be without it  Upon this Foundation no question the Plenipotentiaries of her Majesty acted for first obliging the  French  to stand to it on their part they left it entirely to the Determination of the Parliament to whom it would certainly occur what the value was they Exchanged as well on one Side as the other If it be true that the  French  have Wooll sufficient for their own Manufacturing and both can and do Manufacture sufficient not only to supply their own Dominions Collonies and Plantations but also to Export to other Nations then it must certainly be of no great Use to us to open a Trade with them at all because there is no Advantage to us in it they having little or no occasion for the Manufactures which we think to supply them with  On the other hand If it be true that the  French  upon taking off their new Duties revoking and repealing their Edicts and Tarifs will necessarily take off a great quantity of our Manufactures then it cannot be true as has been so warmly suggested by same Writers That the  French  have go  en the Manufacture into their own Hands and will not only supply themselves but other Nations also On the other hand  France  is a Country  of a vast Extent full of People and if they take our Manufactures for their own Use will take so great a quantity as we can hardly Buy such an Advantage too Dear and the reducing the Duties of their Goods here especially as it is mention'd in the Ninth Article of the Treaty may or may not be a thing of great Extent to them and to us too as we do or do not rightly manage it For example  What is it they ask of us I see but two things that are material in their Demand They ask That we should Repeal all our Prohibitions And Reduce our Additional Customs which have been laid upon their Goods since the Year and they offer to do the like Well says our Merchants What then must the Customs of Wines and Brandies be no more than in the Year that will bring Claret down to the Price of Six Pound to Eight Pound a Hogshhead again and the common Tavern Price to One Shilling  per  Quart and what then will become of our  Spainish  and  Portugal  Wine Trade The Article answers for it self in this Case the mistake is in the Reader not in the Expression for in truth there is nothing at all of such a  reduction but on the contrary the  French  are oblig'd to submit to whatever Duties we think fit to lay upon the Wine and Brandy as will appear more particulary in the next Head For the  French  are wisely brought down to consent to this Proposal  viz  That their Wine should pay as much as the  Portugal  Wine only we join to admit that it shall pay no more and yet the Complaint of our People against this Clause is  so loud  that the old Proportion of things can be ill heard and some People conlude that this equality will ruin the Trade of  England  For  say they  The Inclination of our People to  French  Wine is such that if it be at the same price with the  Portugal  Wine none will Drink the latter and therefore it is absolutely necessary that the  French  Wine should be laid under the disadvantage in their payment of Customs that the  Portugal  Wines may still be made the  Common Draught  as it is called through the Nation  To this there lies two Ob  ections  If it be true that upon opening the  French  Trade as above they will necessarily take our Manufactures in Return for their Wines then we have the same Advantage  in both Trades and ought to Encourage one as well as the other and the Reason is just that the Duties should be alike and the Encouragements or Disadvantages equal if it be not so then it alters the Case But then some other Objections will be ill maintain'd  viz    That the  French  have rejected our Trade to set up the Manufactures among themselves and plac'd high Duties on all our Goods without which they would be outdone and their own Manufactures Discouraged  That the  Portugal  Trade always paid a less Duty than the  French  is a great mistake and consequently it is a mistake That it they are reduced to an Equality the  Portugal  Trade will be ruin'd for it is apparent that from the Restoration to the Revolution being Twenty eight years and the Reign of two Kings the  French  Wines were always Charg'd at above  s per  Ton less Custome than the  Portuguese  Wines which always paid  Spanish  Wine Duties and yet the  Portuguese  had a very considerable Trade with us for Wine and very far it was from being lost  Again We do not see that this Demand of the  French  will help their Brandy Trade at all For all they Demand is that their Brandy shall pay no more Duties than the Brandy of other Nations it is but passing an Act then that the Brandy from  Spain    Italy  or any other Nation shall pay as much as the  French  pay now and the Brandy Trade stands just where it was This is so easie to do and of so little Consequence to us that it cannot be Disputed For all the Brandy that we Import from  Spain  and  Italy  is so little and so ordinary that it matters not to us whether we Import any of it or no and whatever then is wanting in the Import of Brandy by reason of the high Duty will be made up in Malt and Melasses Spirits and so the Treaty of Commerce may be a means to preserve the Distilling Trade to us which every one owns is of the Greatest Consequence and which can be supported humanly speaking no other way  If the  English  Plenipotentiaries foresaw this they acted very wisely when they brought the  French  to yield up that Point and not absolutely Determine the reducing the Duties to what they were before the first War which would have  been very injurious to our Trade if they did not forsee it the good Luck is greater than the good Meaning and it is to be hoped the Commissioners who are to Treat still of farther Regulations will take care to make this Article of the Brandy effectual  In this could we be Impartial in our Judgment of things we might see that this Treaty of Commerce is made with several advantageous Clauses against the  French  Trade which none that ever past before Contain'd and in this particular it is remarkably advantageous That the  French  are bound to take off all the Duties Customs Tarifs Edicts  c  since as by the Article but we are only obliged to provide by a Law that their Goods pay no more than the Goods of other Nations So that if we please to Charge the  Spanish  Brandy the  Portugal  Reds  Malaga  Whites  Florence    Galitia    c  at  l per  Ton the  French  must pay the same  I would not be found putting a wrong Construction upon the Treaty and consequently upon the Treaters but I leave every Man to make his judgment from the Words of the th Article which run thus  'It is farther Enacted That within the space of two Months after a Law shall be made in  GreatBritain  whereby it shall be sufficiently provided That no more Customs or Duties be paid for Goods and Merchandizes brought from  France  to  GreatBritain  than what are payable for Goods and Merchandizes  of the like Nature  Imported into  GreatBritain  from any other Country in  Europe  and that all Laws made in  GreatBritain  since the year for Prohibiting the Importation of any Goods and Merchandizes coming from  France  which were not Prohibited before that time be Repealed The General Tarif made in  France  the th day of  September  in the year shall take Place there again and the Duties payable in  France  by the Subjects of  GreatBritain  for Goods Imported and Exported shall be paid according to the Tenor of the Tarif above mentioned and shall not exceed the Rule therein settled'  It seems plain here as Words can express it That we are only to make a Law or Act of Parliament to reduce the Duty of  French  Wines and the Duty of all other Country Wines to the same Rate the like of Brandies  c  That  upon our doing this upon our passing this Law or within two Months after it the  French  are obliged to admit our  English  Goods upon the Foot of the Tarif of and to Repeal all the Additions of Taxes Customs or Duties Whatsoever which have been laid since that time to the Rate they were at before  I believe this part of the Article has not been Considered as it might have been by most People and if it had perhaps so many would not blindfold have Condemn'd the Article  Ruinous and Destruct  to our Trade even before they enquired into the particulars But as I hope the  istakes of this kind are not so many or so great but that they may be easily rectified and the People will be forward to own themselves in the wrong when they see plainly that the Advantage is on our side These Considerations obliges me rather to endeavour to convince the Persons of their Error than to refle  t upon their Weakness  Upon the whole the Treaty like other things of so nice a nature gives many People uneasiness at first sight for want of rightly understanding the intent and meaning of it and to others for want of Considering rightly what they  do understand of it The Conditions of it are evidently to the Advantage of the  English  Commerce in the main perhaps some part of Trade some particular Persons and Interests in Trade may be touch'd may be shortned in their present Advantages and future Prospects but as to the Interest of Trade in General I think it easie to make out that the Commissioners who are to meet to Regulate Duties Remove Difficulties and State the P  ons and D  ences of Things may so order it that the General Interest of Trade in  Britain  shall be bettered very much by the Treaty And tho' it is reported and is not doubted but Endeavours are now using and will be used to procure Clamouring Petitions from the several Manufacturers and Labouring Poor as well in the Trade of Silk as Wooll yet I am perswaded Time will shew them that the first will be little injur'd and the last greatly better'd by this Treaty espece  lly if the Commissioners who shall be Entrusted with the Management of it understand their Duty and act their Part with Courage and Fidelity  And that we may a little open the Eyes of the Commons about this matter for they seem to be the most affected with the Danger from it a Word or two may be necessary to say to them  First for the Woollen Manufacturers It has been for many Years the Complaint That the  French  have Prohibited our Woollen Manufacture That they have put a stop to our Trade That the  Dutch  have a great Trade to  France    Holland  and  Flanders  who make prodigious quantities of our kinds of Manufactures send them into  France  and ours are Prohibited and the like The Government having now made an Essay to Remedy this Evil and to open a Trade for our Manufactures We seem agriev'd and as much offended the other way because by opening this Trade with them the Silk Trade and the  Portugal  Wine Trade will be touch'd But look into your Woollen Manufacture Trade if opening a Trade with  France  Gives you a Free Market in so large a Country where you had none before Shall not this Encrease the Consumption of the Woollen Manufacture And is not that of infinitely more vallue than what we  speak of against it Every one agrees that our Woollen Manufacture is the Life and Soul of the  English  Trade and if this be but forwarded and promoted whatever other Trade suffers it is able sufficiently to make us amends for that Loss The Employment of Families is this way and perhaps this way only to be supplied If it were possible that other Manufactures could be Encourag'd and this be Preserv'd we should all be pleas'd and satisfied But this must be Preserv'd must be Encourag'd must be Extended whatever risque we run of the rest Either  France  will  upon the making this Treaty Effectual  take off a very great quantity of our Woollen Manufactures or it will not  if it will not  Why do we desire a Treaty of Commerce at all Why do we Complain that the  French  have Prohibited Trade with us  If it will  if the Market for our Manufactures will be great in  France  then what are we Dissatisfied at and why is not the Treaty now made our Advantage Let those People who argue against it Compare the Advantages of an Encrease of our Wollen Manufacture with all the Disadvantages to other Trades and see whether  the Benefit on one hand is not such that the Loss on the other hand ought to be risqu'd for it  But here comes in our Complaining Crouds with Petitions and mournful Representations That their Manufactures will be ruin'd the  Colchester  poor People as I have been told are particularly alarm'd and yet it was never heard that the  French  ever went about to make a Piece of Bays in this World no nor are they able to do it they know the impracticableness of it What then can be the Dissatisfaction that can affect that side I might name sundry other People who are Employed in Manufactures in  England  especially those which depend upon the goodness of the Wooll whether the Fineness or the Length of the Staple The Petitions therefore of these People if they come ought to express that their Apprehensions of the  French  are grounded upon sufficient Evidence of Fact such as That they have already attempted or are likely to attempt the making Bays in  France  and the like  It were then to be wish'd some People would calculate a little from just propositions what quantity of Manufactures  France  has usually taken from us when we Traded with them upon the Foot of the Tarif of and what it is probable they may take again if matters return to that Channel and then it would be seen what price we ought to bid in Order to restore the Trade to that Rule of Taxation and what such a purchase would be worth in our other Trade which as they say we must give in Exchange for it and this would be a very good way to make a right Judgment of the thing for as is said before either our Goods will find a Sale in  France  or they will not if they will it is certainly our Interest to procure the Trade to be open and though it should hurt us a little in some other branches of our Commerce the loss would not be felt  at least  not enough to move us to prevent it because of the Profit of the Woollen Manufactures which is our main Support and Dependency  This brings me to mention the Complaint of those who are concern'd in the Silk Manufactures which is the alternative  to the other These People are made to believe that they shall Infallibly not suffer only but be ruin'd and they talk already of such a stop to the Weaving that I know not how many Journeymen Weavers more I believe by a great many than there are in the whole Broad Weaving Trade are already turn'd off and out of Employment  I do acknowledge it is a hard and melancholly Circumstance when any publick Transaction so clashes the parts of the Body I mean the Body of the Nation that one can hardly live without the Destruction of the other and yet as I said above the Woollen Trade is so great that there is no comparison between it and the Silk Manufacture neither must the preservation of the one be set in competition when the preservation of the other is the immediate Question But what if after all the Melancholly things which have been said upon this Subject it should appear that the Silk Manufacture in  England  may be preserv'd and supported in a consistency with the present Treaty of Commerce and particularly with that part of the Ninth Article which Conditions  for the taking off the Prohibitions upon the  French  Goods Imported into  England  This is a Point few have touch'd upon but I make no question it may be farther handled in time and those Persons whoever they shall be who shall be employ'd by the Government to regulate the Duties of the two Naions and to remove the difficulties that may be in the way cannot be so Destitute as to want a proper medium for the clashing Interests between the Silk Manufactures of each Kingdom as well as for that of the Woollen  If then the Woollen Manufacture be encreased and the Silk not diminished the Woollen advanced and the Silk not discouraged Men must be very much at a loss to find out wherein the Damage or Intricacy of the Ninth Article of the Treaty of Commerce does consist  The missfortune lies in the difficulty there is to open the Eyes of the Poor People who are severally employ'd in the  English  Manufactures whether of Silk or Wooll both which for ought I see are equally allarm'd and equally possess'd with apprehensions of their Trade being ruin'd by the  French  But all popular Disatisfactions are allay'd by time the care of the Government will be to prevent the real Mischiefs and the Fears of the People will wear off in the experiment when the Woollen Manufacturers shall see that a greater quantity of Goods are Vended than used to be and the Silk Manufacturers shall see that as many Looms are employ'd as were before then the Folly and Blindness of their present apprehensions will abate and they will Peaceably acknowledge that that were mistaken  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  THe History of Treaties Containing all those that have been concluded from the Peace of
