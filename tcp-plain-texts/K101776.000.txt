 POEMS UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  By Mrs  LEAPOR  of  Brackley  in  Northamptonshire  LONDON  Printed And Sold by  J Roberts  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXLVIII  TO THE READER  THE Author of the following Poems was taken from the World at the time when she first began to meet with Encouragement to print them and in Compliance with her dying Request they are now published for the Benefit of her Father who is desirous to make use of this Opportunity of returning his humble Thanks to the Subscribers for the Favour they have been pleased to shew him  The short Account which has been given of Mrs  Leapor  with the Proposals for a Subscription it is hop'd will sufficiently apologize for the Defects that shall be found in this Collection Had she lived to correct and finish these first Productions of a young unassisted Genius certainly they would have been greatly improved tho' as they now appear in their native Simplicity they cannot surely but afford an agreeable Entertainment to the Reader and serve as a convincing Proof of the common Aphorism  Poeta nascitur non fit  Mrs  Leapor  from a Child delighted in reading and particularly Poetry but had few Opportunities of procuring any Books of that kind The Author  she most admired was Mr  Pope  whom she chiefly endeavoured to imitate how far she succeeded in this or any other of her Attempts must be left to the Judgment of the Publick And indeed if the Poems will not recommend themselves to the Reader little Advantage is to be expected from any thing that can be said of them here but in Justice to the Memory of the Author as well as for the Satisfaction of all those who have so chearfully and generously contributed to improve the best Legacy she could bequeath to her Father we beg leave to inform them that her Conduct and Behaviour entirely corresponded with those virtuous and pious Sentiments which are conspicuous in her Poems She was courteous and obliging to all chearful goodnatured and contented in the Station of Life in which Providence had placed her The generous and charitable Spirit that appeared in her was exerted upon all Occasions to the utmost of her Ability and was such as would have been ornamental in a much higher Sphere to which in all Probability if it had pleased God to spare her Life her own Merit would have raised her  Some of her Papers a little time before her Death were communicated to several Persons of Rank and of distinguished Taste and Judgment who were pleased to express a great Satisfaction in the View they had of promoting a Subscription for their being printed and by that means encouraging her to proceed in a Science so agreeable to herself and entertaining to them but her Friends are now left to lament her Loss and that so great a Part of a short and valuable Life was spent in Obscurity  A LIST OF THE SUBSCRIBERS NAMES  A  THE Right Honourable the Earl of  Arran  The Right Honourable the Countess of  Arran  Mrs  Mary Adkins  Mrs  Addis  Mrs  Abram  Mrs  Sarah Arme

and Triumph of the Plain  Whose shining Eyes a thousand Hearts alarm'd  Whose Wit inspired and whose Follies charm'd  Who with Invention rack'd her careful Breast  To find new Graces to insult the rest  Now sees her Temples take a swarthy Hue  And the dark Veins resign their beauteous Blue  While on her Cheeks the fading Roses die  And the last Sparkles tremble in her Eye  Bright Sol had drove the sable Clouds away  And chear'd the Heavens with a Stream of Day  The woodland Choir their little Throats prepare  To chant new Carols to the Morning Air  In Silence wrap'd and curtain'd from the Day  On her sad Pillow lost  Dorinda  lay  To Mirth a Stranger and the like to Ease  No Pleasures charm her nor no Slumbers please  For if to close her weary Lids she tries  Detested Wrinkles swim before her Eyes  At length the Mourner rais'd her aking Head  And discontented left her hated Bed  But sighing shun'd the Relicks of her Pride  And left the Toilet for the Chimney Side  Her careless Locks upon her Shoulders lay  Uncurl'd alas because they half were Gray  No magick Baths employ her skilful Hand  But useless Phials on her Table stand  She slights her Form no more by Youth inspir'd  And loaths that Idol which she once admir'd  At length all trembling of herself afraid  To her lov'd Glass repair'd the weeping Maid  And with a Sigh address'd the alter'd Shade  Say what art thou that wear'st a gloomy Form  With low'ring Forehead like a northern Storm  Cheeks pale and hollow as the Face of Woe  And Lips that with no gay Vermilion glow  Where is that Form which this false Mirror told  Bloom'd like the Morn and shou'd for Ages hold  But now a Spectre in its room appears  All scar'd with Furrows and defac'd with Tears  Say com'st thou from the Regions of Despair  To shake my Senses with a meagre Stare  Some stragg'ling Horror may thy Phantom be  But surely not the mimick Shape of me  Ah yesthe Shade its mourning Visage rears  Pants when I sigh and answers to my Tears  Now who shall bow before this wither'd Shrine  This Mortal Image that was late Divine  What Victim now will praise these faded Eyes  Once the gay Basis for a thousand Lyes  Deceitful Beautyfalse as thou art gay  And is it thus thy Vot'ries find their Pay  This the Reward of many careful Years  Of Morning Labours and of Noonday Fears  The Gloves anointed and the bathing Hour  And soft Cosmetick's more prevailing Pow'r  Yet to thy Worship still the fair Ones run  And hail thy Temples with the rising Sun  Still the brown Damsels to thy Altars pay  Sweetscented Unguents and the Dews of  May  Sempronia  smooths her wrinkled Brows with Care  And  Isabella  curls her grisled Hair  See poor  Augusta  of her Glass afraid  Who even trembles at the Name of Maid  Spreads the fine  Mechlin  on her shaking Head  While her thin Cheeks disown the mimick Red  Soft  Silvia  who no Lover's Breast alarms  Yet simpers out the Ev'ning of her Charms  And tho' her Cheek can boast no rosy Dye  Her gay Brocades allure the gazing Eye  But hear my SistersHear an ancient Maid  Too long by Folly and her Arts betray'd  From these light Trifles turn your partial Eyes  'Tis sad  Dorinda  prays you to be wise  And thou  Celinda  thou must shortly feel  The sad Effect of Time's revolving Wheel  Thy Spring is past thy Summer Sun declin'd  See Autumn next and Winter stalks behind  But let not Reason with thy Beauties fly  Nor place thy Merit in a brilliant Eye  'Tis thine to charm us by sublimer ways  And make thy Temper like thy Features please  And thou  Sempronia  trudge to Morning Pray'r  Nor trim thy Eyebrows with so nice a Care  Dear Nymph believe'tis true as you're alive  Those Temples show the Marks of Fiftyfive  Let  Isabel  unload her aking Head  Of twisted Papers and of binding Lead  Let sage  Augusta  now without a Frown  Strip those gay Ribbands from her aged Crown  Change the lac'd Slipper of delicious Hue  For a warm Stocking and an easy Shoe  Guard her swell'd Ancles from Rheumatick Pain  And from her Cheek expunge the guilty Stain  Wou'd smiling  Silvia  lay that Hoop aside  'Twou'd snow her Prudence not betray her Pride  She like the rest had once her flagrant Day  But now she twinkles in a fainter Ray  Those youthful Airs set off their Mistress now  Just as the Patch adorns her Autumn Brow  In vain her Feet in sparkling Laces glow  Since none regard her Forehead nor her Toe  Who would not burst with Laughter or with Spleen  At  Prudo  once a Beauty as I ween  But now her Features wear a dusky Hue  The little Loves have bid her Eyes adieu  Yet she pursues the Pleasures of her Prime  And vain Desires not subdu'd by Time  Thrusts in amongst the Frolick and the Gay  But shuts her Daughter from the Beams of Day  The Child she says is indolent and grave  And tells the World  Ophelia  can't behave  But while  Ophelia  is forbid the Room  Her Mother hobbles in a Rigadoon  Or to the Sound of melting Musick dies  And in their Sockets rolls her blinking Eyes  Or stuns the Audience with her hideous Squal  While Scorn and Satire whisper through the Hall  Hear this ye fair Ones that survive your Charms  Nor reach at Folly with your aged Arms  Thus  Pope  has sung thus let  Dorinda  sing  " Virtue brave Boys'tis Virtue makes a King"  Why not a Queen fair Virtue is the same  In the rough Hero and the smiling Dame  Dorinda  's Soul her Beauties shall pursue  Tho' late I see her and embrace her too  Come ye blest Graces that are sure to please  The Smile of Friendship and the careless Ease  The Breast of Candour the relenting Ear  The Hand of Bounty and the Heart sincere  May these the Twilight of my Days attend  And may that Ev'ning never want a Friend  To smooth my Passage to the silent Gloom  And give a Tear to grace the mournful Tomb  MIRA's WILL  IMPRIMISMy departed Shade I trust  To Heav'nMy Body to the silent Dust  My Name to publick Censure I submit  To be dispos'd of as the World thinks fit  My Vice and Folly let Oblivion close  The World already is o'erstock'd with those  My Wit I give as Misers give their Store  To those who think they had enough before  Bestow my Patience to compose the Lives  Of slighted Virgins and neglected Wives  To modish Lovers I resign my Truth  My cool Reflexion to unthinking Youth  And some Goodnature give 'tis my Desire  To surly Husbands as their Needs require  And first discharge my Funeraland then  To the small Poets I bequeath my Pen  Let a small Sprig true Emblem of my Rhyme  Of blasted Laurel on my Hearse recline  Let some grave Wight that struggles for Renown  By chanting Dirges through a MarketTown  With gentle Step precede the solemn Train  A broken Flute upon his Arm shall lean  Six comick Poets may the Corse surround  And All Freeholders if they can be found  Then follow next the melancholy Throng  As shrewd Instructors who themselves are wrong  The Virtuoso rich in Sundry'd Weeds  The Politician whom no Mortal heeds  The silent Lawyer chamber'd all the Day  And the stern Soldier that receives no Pay  But staythe Mourners shou'd be first our Care  Let the freed Prentice lead the Miser's Heir  Let the young Relict wipe her mournful Eye  And widow'd Husbands o'er their Garlick cry  All this let my Executors fulfil  And rest assur'd that this is  Mira  's Will  Who was when she these Legacies design'd  In Body healthy and compos'd in Mind  The FRIEND in Disgrace  A DIALOGUE  LYCANDER  DAMON why so cold and serious  Wherefore that reluctant Bow  Why so haughty and imperious  Say have you forgot me now  Tho array'd in coarse Attire  You may read  Lycander  's Face  For 'tis Him my gentle Squire  Justled in a homely Case  True no shining Slaves surround me  And my Brows with Sorrow bend  Fortune left me as she found me  Yet let  Damon  own his Friend  DAMON  Sir your Servant and all that Sir  But indeed I am in haste  Surely pray keep on your Hat Sir  I have somewhere seen your Face  LYCANDER  Am I grown so great a Stranger  Yet 'tis hardly half a Year  Since you vow'd in e'ery Danger  Not your Life was half so dear  Sure the Court is mighty lulling  Not the Streams of  Lethe  more  E'en the Groom and dirty Scullion  Know not those they lov'd before  So on that fatal Day you did  The Levee of his Grace attend  You of your Memory was rid  I of my Fortune and my Friend  DAMON  'Tis Bus'ness Sir that fills my Head  Believe me now I cannot stay  I'll order half a Pint of Red  And if you'll drink it Sir you may  An ODE on MERCY  In Imitation of Part of the th Psalm  I  'TIS  Mercy  callsAwake my grateful String  Ye Worlds of Nature listen while I sing  'Tis not his dire avenging Rod  I sing the Mercies of a God  Hark ye Warblers of the Sky  Rivers glide serenely by  Or rather in the sacred Chorus join  Till our united Voices reach the Seats Divine  II  Where injur'd Saints that us'd to mourn below  Find their glad Breasts with Joys eternal glow  Where thousand Tongues incessant cry  Glory be to God on high  Dominion Power Praise and then  Mercy to the Sons of Men  Heav'n hears delighted and the joyful Sound  Swell'd with celestial Musick spreads the Regions round  III  The Lord though seated far beyond the Sky  Yet sees the wretched with a pitying Eye  That Power knows our secret Fear  The lonely Sigh or silent Tear  He sees the Widows streaming Eye  And hears the hungry Orphans cry  Depending Worlds his sacred Bounty share  All Creatures find a Part of their Creator's Care  IV  His Justice next employs the heavenly String  And hymning Angels tremble while they sing  The Lord is just and holy then  O weep ye thoughtless Sons of Men  For who can from his Anger fly  Or shun the Frown of God most high  Yet shall the Sigh or penitential Groan  Mount like the Seraph's Wing and reach the sacred Throne  V  Hear this ye pious but dejected Minds  Whom Errors darken or whom Weakness binds  Lift from the Dust your mournful Eye  And know the Lord your Help is nigh  These Sorrows from your Breasts shall roll  And Comfort bless the humble Soul  Let chearful Hope in ev'ry Bosom spring  For boundless Mercy dwells with Heaven's immortal King  VI  Come then ye Worlds with mingled Voices raise  A Song of mean but not ungrateful Praise  Tho' the dull Numbers rudely flow  And our cold Hearts but faintly glow  Our Raptures own a less Degree  Yet Cherubs sing and so shou'd we  The Almighty hears and gives us leave to call  On him the Judge the Guide and sacred Lord of All  VII  All you that bend beneath the Stroke of Time  And you whose Cheeks confess their healthy Prime  Your Maker and Preserver praise  For early and for length of Days  The pious and the grateful Song  Shall lisp upon the Infant's Tongue  While heav'nly Mercy sooths the Mourner's Care  And bids the Innocent rejoice the Sinner not despair  The BEAUTIES of the SPRING  HALL happy Shades and hail thou chearful Plain  Where Peace and Pleasure unmolested reign  Where dewy Buds their blushing Bosoms show  And the coll Rivers murmur as they flow  See yellow Crowfoots deck the gaudy Hills  While the faint Primrose loves the purling Rills  Sagacious Bees their Labours now renew  Hum round the Blossoms and extract their Dew  In their new Liv'ries the green Woods appear  And smiling Nature decks the Infant Year  See you proud Elm that shines in borrow'd Charms  While the curl'd Woodbines deck her aged Arms  When the streak'd East receives a lighter Gray  And Larks prepare to meet the early Day  Through the glad Bowers the shrill Anthems run  While the Groves glitter to the rising Sun  Then  Phillis  hastens to her darling Cow  Whose shining Tresses wanton on her Brow  While to her Cheek enliv'ning Colours fly  And Health and Pleasure sparkle in her Eye  Unspoil'd by Riches nor with Knowledge vain  Contented  Cymon  whistles o'er the Plain  His Flock dismisses from their nightly Fold  Observes their Health and sees their Number told  Pleas'd with its Being see the nimble Fawn  Sports in the Grove or wantons o'er the Lawn  While the pleas'd Coursers frolick out the Day  And the dull Ox affects unwieldy Play  Then haste my Friend to yonder  Sylvan  Bowers  Where Peace and Silence crown the blissful Hours  In those still Groves no martial Clamours sound  No streaming Purple stains the guiltless Ground  But fairer Scenes our ravish'd Eyes employ  Give a soft Pleasure and a quiet Joy  Grief flies from hence and wasting Cares subside  While wing'd with Mirth the laughing Minutes glide  See my fair Friend the painted Shrubs are gay  And round they Head ambrosial Odours play  At Sight of thee the swelling Buds expand  And op'ning Roses seem to court thy Hand  Hark the shrill Linnet charms the distant Plain  And  Philomel  replies with softer Strain  See those bright Lilies shine with milky Hue  And those fair Cowslips drop with balmy Dew  To thee my Fair the chearful Linnet sings  And  Philomela  warbles o'er the Springs  For thee those Lilies paint the fertile Ground  And those fair Cowslips are with Nectar crown'd  Here let us rest to shun the scorching Ray  While curling Zephyrs in the Branches play  In these calm Shades no ghastly Woe appears  No Cries of Wretches stun our frighted Ears  Here no gloss'd Hate no sainted Wolves are seen  Nor busy Faces throng the peaceful Green  But Fear and Sorrow leave the careful Breast  And the glad Soul sinks happily to Rest  DAMON and STREPHON  A Pastoral Complaint  Damon  SAY why these Sighs that in thy Bosom rise  Why from thy Cheek the wonted Crimson flies  Why on the Ground are fix'd thy streaming Eyes  Strephon  Still let this Bosom swell with aking Woe  And from my Eyes the streaming Sorrows flow  But Oh the CauseSee Clouds are gath'ring round  And Zephyrs wait to catch the mournful Sound  The sick'ning Trees all shed their blooming Store  Why wouldst thou hear it  Sylvius  is no more  Damon  Is  Sylvius  deadthen  Phillis  rend thy Hair  And blot those Features that were late so fair  Thou Sun forbear to gild this fatal Day  Nor you my Lambkins dare to think of Play  Strephon  No more alasno more the tuneful Swain  Shall with soft Numbers charm the list'ning Plain  No more his Flute shall greet the dawning Spring  Nor to his Hand rebound the trembling String  Damon  Ah cruel Death wou'd none but  Sylvius  do  No meaner Swain amongst the worthy few  Why didst thou take and leave the baser Tribe  The Flow'r of Shepherds and the Muses Pride  Strephon  None knew like him the heav'nly Notes to swell  And moral Tales in pleasing Numbers tell  While  Sylvius  sung none thought the Day too long  But all repin'd at the too hasty Song  Damon  Ye solemn Winds that whistle through the Glade  Or rudely bluster in the darker Shade  Go bear our Sorrows to the distant Shore  And tell them  Sylvius  chears our Plains no more  Strephon  Vain are our Sighs our Tears as vainly flow  And each sad Bosom swells with fruitless Woe  As northern Blasts destroy the Autumn Store  So  Sylvius  fell and shall return no more  Damon  Enough of Sorrownow your Garlands bring  Crop all the Beauties of the early Spring  Around his Tomb these willing Hands shall twine  The choicest Briers of sweet Eglantine  Strephon  On his cold Grave a Laurel I bestow  Which late did in my Father's Garden grow  This Wreath  Amyntas  ask'd to shade her Brow  But to my  Sylvius  I resign it now  Damon  The pensive Swains shall strike their Bosoms there  And softey'd Virgins drop a gentle Tear  May some good Angel guard the sacred Ground  And Flow'rs unfading shed their Sweets around  A SUMMER'S WISH  MY Guardian bear me on thy downy Wing  To some cool Shade where infant Flow'rs spring  Where on the Trees sweet Honysuckles blow  And ruddy Daisies paint the Ground below  Where the shrill Linnet charms the solemn Shade  And Zephyrs pant along the cooler Glade  Or shake the Bullrush by a River Side  While the gay Sunbeams sparkle on the Tide  O for some Grot whose rustick Sides declare  Ease and not Splendor was the Builder's Care  Where Roses spread their unaffected Charms  And the curl'd Vine extends her clasping Arms  Where happy Silence lulls the quiet Soul  And makes it calm as Summer Waters roll  Here let me learn to check each growing Ill  And bring to Reason disobedient Will  To watch this incoherent Breast and find  What fav'rite Passions rule the giddy Mind  Here no Reproaches grate the wounded Ear  We see delighted and transported hear  While the glad Warblers wanton round the Trees  And the still Waters catch the dying Breeze  Grief waits without and melancholy Gloom  Come chearful Hope and fill the vacant Room  Come ev'ry Thought which Virtue gave to please  Come smiling Health with thy Companion Ease  Let these and all that Virtue's self attends  Bless the still Hours of my gentle Friends  Peace to my Foes if any such there be  And gracious Heav'n give Repose to me  An HYMN to the MORNING  I  SEE the lovely  Morning  rise  See her Glories paint the Skies  Half o'er the reviving Globe  Gaily spreads her Saffron Robe  See the Hills with Flowers crown'd  And the Valleys laughing round  II  Mira  to  Aurora  sings  While the Lark exulting springs  High in Airand tunes her Throat  To a soft and merry Note  The Goldfinch and the Linnet join  Hail  Aurora  Nymph divine  III  See  Clione  's gilded Car  See it blazes from afar  Here the fair One bends her Way  Balmy Zephyrs round her play  Now she lights upon the Vale  Fond to meet the western Gale  IV  May this artless Praise be thine  Soft  Clione  half divine  See her snowy Hand she waves  Silent stand her waiting Slaves  And while they guard the Silver Reins  She wanders lonely o'er the Plains  V  See those Cheeks of beauteous Dye  Lovely as the dawning Sky  Innocence that ne'er beguiles  Lips that wear eternal Smiles  Beauties to the rest unknown  Shine in her and her alone  VI  Now the Rivers smoother flow  Now the op'ning Roses glow  The Woodbine twines her odorous Charms  Round the Oaks supporting Arms  Lilies paint the dewy Ground  And  Ambrosia  breathes around  VII  Come ye Gales that fan the Spring  Zephyr with thy downy Wing  Gently waft to  Mira  's Breast  Health Content and balmy Rest  Far O far from hence remain  Sorrow Care and sickly Pain  VIII  Thus sung  Mira  to her Lyre  Till the idle Numbers tire  Ah  Sappho  sweeter sings I cry  And the spiteful Rocks reply  Responsive to the jarring Strings  Sweeter  Sappho  sweeter sings  COLINETTA  TWAS when the Fields had shed their golden Grain  And burning Suns had sear'd the russet Plain  No more the Rose nor Hyacinth were seen  Nor yellow Cowslip on the tufted Green  But the rude Thistle rear'd its hoary Crown  And the ripe Nettle shew'd an irksom Brown  In mournful Plight the tarnish'd Groves appear  And Nature weeps for the declining Year  The Sun too quickly reach'd the western Sky  And rising Vapours hid his ev'ning Eye  Autumnal Threads around the Branches flew  While the dry Stubble drank the falling Dew  In this sick Season at the close of Day  On  Lydia  's Lap pale  Colinetta  lay  Whose sallow Cheeks had lost their rosy Dye  The Sparkles languish'd in her closing Eye  Parch'd were those Lips whence Musick us'd to flow  Nor more the Flute her weary Fingers know  Yet thrice to raise her feeble Voice she try'd  Thrice on her Tongue the fainting Numbers dy'd  At last reviv'd on  Lydia  's Neck she hung  And like the Swan expiring thus she sung  Farewel ye Forests and delightful Hills  Ye flow'ry Meadows and ye crystal Rills  Ye friendly Groves to whom we us'd to run  And beg a Shelter from the burning Sun  Those blasted Shades all mournful now I see  Who droop their Heads as tho' they wept for me  The pensive Linnet has forgot to sing  The Lark is silent till returning Spring  The Spring shall all those wonted Charms restore  Which  Colinetta  must behold no more  Farewel ye Fields my native Fields adieu  Whose fertile Lays my early Labours knew  Where when an Infant I was wont to stray  And gather Kingcups at the closing Day  How oft has  Lydia  told a mournful Tale  By the clear Lake that shines in yonder Vale  When she had done I sung a chearful Lay  While the glad Goldfinch listen'd on the Spray  Lur'd by my Song each jolly Swain drew near  And rosy Virgins throng'd around to hear  Farewel ye Swains ye rosy Nymphs adieu  Tho' I unwilling leave the Streams and you  Still may soft Musick bless your happy Shore  But  Colinetta  you must hear no more  O  Lydia  thou if wayward Tongues shou'd blame  My Life and blot a harmless Maiden's Name  Tell them if e'er I found a straggling Ewe  Although the Owner's Name I hardly knew  I fed it kindly with my Father's Hay  And gave it shelter at the closing Day  I never stole young Pigeons from their Dams  Nor from their Pasture drove my Neighbours Lambs  Nor set my Dog to hunt their Flocks away  That mine might graze upon the vacant Lay  When  Phillida  by dancing won the Prize  Or  Colin  prais'd young  Mariana  's Eyes  When  Damon  wedded  Urs'la  of the Grange  My Cheek with Envy ne'er was seen to change  Whene'er I saw  Aminda  cross the Plain  Or walk the Forest with her darling Swain  I never whisper'd to a Standerby  But hated Scandal and abhorr'd a Lye  On  Sundays  I as Sister  Sue  can tell  Was always ready for the Sermonbell  I honour'd both the Teacher and the Day  Nor us'd to giggle when he bid me pray  Then sure for me there's something good in Store  When  Colinetta  shall be seen no more  When I am gone I leave to Sister  Sue  My Gown of  Jersey  and my Aprons blue  My studded Sheephook  Phillida  may take  Likewise my Hayfork and my Hazel Rake  My hoarded Apples and my winter Pears  Be thine O  Lydia  to reward thy Cares  These Nuts that late were pluck'd from yonder Tree  And this Strawbasket I bequeath to thee  That Basket did these dying Fingers weave  My boxen Flute to  Corydon  I leave  So shall it charm the list'ning Nymphs around  For none like him can make it sweetly sound  In our Churchyard there grows a spreading Yew  Whose dark green Leaves distil a baneful Dew  Be those sad Branches o'er my Grave reclin'd  And let these Words be graven on the Rind  " Mark gentle ReaderUnderneath this Tree  " There sleeps a Maid old  Simon  's Daughter she  " Thou too perhaps ere many Weeks be o'er  " Like  Colinetta  shalt be seen no more  Here ends the Maidfor now the Seal of Death  Clos'd her pale Lips and stop'd her rosy Breath  Her sinking Eyeballs took their long Adieu  And with a Sigh her harmless Spirit flew  The LINNET and the GOLDFINCH  'TWAS when the Morn disclos'd her rosy Brow  And newwak'd Heifers in the Pastures low  When little Songsters in the Gales respire  To  Mira  's Shades repair'd the woodland Choir  Perch'd on a Bough that shone with Morning Dew  The Linnet thus address'd the feather'd Crew  The LINNET  Say my soft Sisters say ye tuneful Throng  Who now demands the Tribute of a Song  Who call'd us here Who gave us leave to rove  And warble in this late forbidden Grove  Not long ago as  Mira  mournful Maid  All pensive sat beneath the dusky Shade  Just o'er her Head I whistled on a Bough  But Discontent sat frowning on her Brow  Be gone thou too officious Bird she cries  And turn'd on Meon Me her angry Eyes  Go from my Bowers lead the tuneful Throng  For  Artemisia  hears no more your Song  These slighted Shades can please the Fair no more  Ye Honysuckles shed your blooming Store  Ye spreading Trees now let your Branches die  And ye shrill Warblers from those Branches fly  She saidthe Blossoms fell from ev'ry Tree  And we dejected from her Arbours flee  We fled all mournful to the distant Plain  Then say who calls us to these Groves again  The GOLDFINCH  By  Mira  's Order to this Grove we came  Mira  whose Sonnets please the rural Dame  'Twas Yesternight she wav'd her Hand to me  As I sat whistling on a Chesnuttree  Come here she cry'd ye soft aërial Choirs  My Ear no more your sprightly Musick tires  Now I can listen all the Ev'ning long  For  Artemisia  will attend your Song  She comes Ye Trees put on your best Array  And with fresh Odours greet the rising Day  Breathe sweet ye Woodbines and with Heads reclin'd  Court the soft Whispers of the western Wind  Ye friendly Zephyrs dry the dewy Ground  Shine bright thou Sun and laugh ye Meads around  Thus  Mira  spokeOnce more the Blossoms glow  And milder Breezes o'er the Mountains blow  The smiling Grove once more renews its Charms  And Trees embracing twist their curling Arms  Safely to shelter the expected Fair  From the hot Sunbeams or the northern Air  Here we attend and hop from Spray to Spray  'Till the kind Fates shall bring the wish'dfor Day  When She of whom our  Mira  daily sings  Whose Name she whispers to the list'ning Springs  Shall bless these Shadesthen ye melodious Throng  Let each prepare 'em for the sprightly Song  Let the shrill Thrush begin her vary'd Strain  And the small Wren in softer Note complain  The piercing Linnet and the Lark agree  Less loud the Redbreast Nightingale and me  Here ends the Goldfinch and exulting springs  Her pleas'd Companions clap their joyful Wings  The MONTH of AUGUST  Sylvanus  a Courtier  Phillis  a Country Maid  SYLVANUS  HAIL  Phillis  brighter than a Morning Sky  Joy of my Heart and Darling of my Eye  See the kind Year her grateful Tribute yields  And roundfac'd Plenty triumphs o'er the Fields  But to yon Gardens let me lead thy Charms  Where the curl'd Vine extends her willing Arms  Whose purple Clusters lure the longing Eye  And the ripe Cherries show their scarlet Dye  PHILLIS  Not all the Sights your boasted Gardens yield  Are half so lovely as my Father's Field  Where large Increase has bless'd the fruitful Plain  And we with Joy behold the swelling Grain  Whose heavy Ears towards the Earth reclin'd  Wave nod and tremble to the whisking Wind  SYLVANUS  But see to emulate those Cheeks of thine  On yon fair Tree the blushing Nect'rins shine  Beneath their Leaves the ruddy Peaches glow  And the plump Figs compose a gallant Show  With gaudy Plumbs see yonder Boughs recline  And ruddy Pears in you  Espalier  twine  There humble Dwarfs in pleasing Order stand  Whose golden Product seems to court thy Hand  PHILLIS  In vain you tempt me while our Orchard bears  Longkeeping Russets lovely Cath'rine Pears  Pearmains and Codlings wheaten Plumbs enough  And the black Damsons load the bending Bough  No Pruningknives our fertile Branches teaze  While yours must grow but as their Masters please  The grateful Trees our Mercy well repay  And rain us Bushels at the rising Day  SYLVANUS  Fair are my Gardens yet you slight them all  Then let us haste to you majestick Hall  Where the glad Roofs shall to thy Voice resound  Thy Voice more sweet than Musick's melting Sound  Now  Orion  's Beam infests the sultry Sky  And scorching Fevers through the Welkin fly  But Art shall teach us to evade his Ray  And the forc'd Fountains near the Windows play  There choice Perfumes shall give a pleasing Gale  And Orangeflow'rs their od'rous Breath exhale  While on the Walls the wellwrought Paintings glow  And dazzling Carpets deck the Floors below  O tell me Thou whose careless Beauties charm  Are these not fairer than a Thresher's Barn  PHILLIS  Believe me I can find no Charms at all  In your fine Carpets and your painted Hall  'Tis true our Parlour has an earthen Floor  The Sides of Plaster and of Elm the Door  Yet the rub'd Chest and Table sweetly shines  And the spread Mint along the Window climbs  An aged Laurel keeps away the Sun  And two cool Streams across the Garden run  SYLVANUS  Can Feasts or Musick win my lovely Maid  In both those Pleasures be her Taste obey'd  The ransack'd Earth shall all its Dainties send  Till with its Load her plenteous Table bend  Then to the Roofs the swelling Notes shall rise  Pierce the glad Air and gain upon the Skies  While Ease and Rapture spreads itself around  And distant Hills roll back the charming Sound  PHILLIS  Not this will lure me for I'd have you know  This Night to feast with  Corydon  I go  To Night his Reapers bring the gather'd Grain  Home to his Barns and leave the naked Plain  Then Beef and Coleworts Beans and Bacon too  And the Plumbpudding of delicious Hue  Sweetspiced Cake and Applepies good Store  Deck the brown Board who can desire more  His Flute and Tabor too  Amyntor  brings  And while he plays soft  Amaryllis  sings  Then strive no more to win a simple Maid  From her lov'd Cottage and her silent Shade  Let  Phillis  ne'er ah never let her rove  From her first Virtue and her humble Grove  Go seek some Nymph that equals your Degree  And leave Content and  Corydon  for me  An EPISTLE to a LADY  IN vain dear Madam yes in vain you strive  Alas to make your luckless  Mira  thrive  For  Tycho  and  Copernicus  agree  No golden Planet bent its Rays on me  'Tis twenty Winters if it is no more  To speak the Truth it may be Twenty four  As many Springs their 'pointed Space have run  Since  Mira  's Eyes first open'd on the Sun  'Twas when the Flocks on slabby Hillocks lye  And the cold Fishes rule the watry Sky  But tho' these Eyes the learned Page explore  And turn the pond'rous Volumes o'er and o'er  I find no Comfort from their Systems flow  But am dejected more as more I know  Hope shines a while but like a Vapour flies  The Fate of all the Curious and the Wise  For Ah cold  Saturn  triumph'd on that Day  And frowning  Sol  deny'd his golden Ray  You see I'm learned and I shew't the more  That none may wonder when they find me poor  Yet  Mira  dreams as slumbring Poets may  And rolls in Treasures till the breaking Day  While Books and Pictures in bright Order rise  And painted Parlours swim before her Eyes  Till the shrill Clock impertinently rings  And the soft Visions move their shining Wings  Then  Mira  wakesher Pictures are no more  And through her Fingers slides the vanish'd Ore  Convinc'd too soon her Eye unwilling falls  On the blue Curtains and the dusty Walls  She wakes alas to Business and to Woes  To sweep her Kitchen and to mend her Clothes  But see pale Sickness with her languid Eyes  At whose Appearance all Delusion flies  The World recedes its Vanities decline  Clorinda  's Features seem as faint as mine  Gay Robes no more the aking Sight admires  Wit grates the Ear and melting Musick tires  Its wonted Pleasures with each Sense decay  Books please no more and Paintings fade away  The sliding Joys in misty Vapours end  Yet let me still Ah let me grasp a Friend  And when each Joy when each lov'd Object flies  Be you the last that leaves my closing Eyes  But how will this dismantl'd Soul appear  When strip'd of all it lately held so dear  Forc'd from its Prison of expiring Clay  Afraid and shiv'ring at the doubtful Way  Yet did these Eyes a dying Parent see  Loos'd from all Cares except a Thought for me  Without a Tear resign her short'ning Breath  And dauntless meet the ling'ring Stroke of Death  Then at th' Almighty's Sentence shall I mourn  " Of Dust thou art to Dust shalt thou return"  Or shall I wish to stretch the Line of Fate  That the dull Years may bear a longer Date  To share the Follies of succeeding Times  With more Vexations and with deeper Crimes  Ah notho' Heav'n brings near the final Day  For such a Life I will not dare not pray  But let the Tear for future Mercy flow  And fall resign'd beneath the mighty Blow  Nor I alonefor through the spacious Ball  With me will Numbers of all Ages fall  And the same Day that  Mira  yields her Breath  Thousands may enter through the Gates of Death  The Proclamation of APOLLO  MAY  Artemisia  hear my Strain  I quote the Sages once again  And shou'd you ask the Reason why  " Old Authors fib and so may I"  Proceed we thenOld Authors say  Apollo  once made Holiday  And call'd the Brethren of the Quill  To feast upon his tuneful Hill  From ev'ry Nook and ev'ry Wind  They came for who wou'd stay behind  Great was the Crowd as may be guess'd  Side grew to Side and Back to Breast  Till the Imperial Prince of Song  Who fearing something might be wrong  Sent forth a Troop with Caps and Spears  Much like  Parnassian  Granadiers  With surly Eyes and sour Faces  To part the Crowd and give 'em Places  Now I have quite forgot I fear  What Names the People gave 'em there  Amongst the MusesBut I trow  Men call 'em Criticks here below  Now when at last these sage Reformers  Had drove the Crew to Heaps and Corners  They call'd them out by two and three  And set 'em in a due Degree  That each his proper Place shou'd know  On Laurel Benches all arow  Now you may think they all were happy  As Drunkard o'er his Jug of Nappy  That ev'ry Brow was smooth and clear  But first I beg you'd lend an Ear  The Queen of Love to grace the Feast  Had sent a thousand Pipes at least  Of smiling  Nectar  neat and fine  To whet the Guests before they dine  But when the Cups had walk'd about  Some surly Bards began to pout  And wrinkle up their tiny Faces  And fret and fume about their Places  Their giddy Brains began to glow  Each thinking he was plac'd too low  This vow'd to make all Creatures fear him  And That cou'd bear no Creature near him  One seem'd to talk with mighty Spirit  Of baffl'd Worth and slighted Merit  Another was in Passion hurl'd  And curs'd the stupid senseless World  Till Choler swell'd in ev'ry Vein  And each no longer cou'd contain  But fairly went as I'm a Sinner  To Loggerheads before their Dinner  Apollo  was offended quite  And all the Muses in a Fright  Then thunder'd out a Proclamation  " O YeAnd all the rhiming Nation  " Our King commands you to be still  " And not disturb the sacred Hill  " If some refusing to be quiet  " Shall dare to aid this lawless Riot  " The Statutes of  Parnassian  tender  " The Stocks to ev'ry such Offender  " At this the Riot seem'd to cease  " And with a murmur sunk in Peace  " When all was silent to a Man  " Again the Herald thus began  " Directed by your Prince I bring  " This Message from the laurel'd King  " Who long has view'd with silent Woe  " Your Quarrels in the World below  " How moral and satirick Wits  " And jingling PedantsRhiming Cits  " The gay the empty and the full  " The soft the froward and the dull  " Wage endless Wars with one another  " And ev'ry Blockhead hates his Brother  " But while you take a world of pains  " In pelting at each other's Brains  " While Envy swells the little Mind  " You ne'er consider that you find  " To see you in the Tempest hurl'd  " Diversion for the laughing World  " And so you break all moral Rules  " To grow the Mockingstock of Fools  " But now  Apollo  begs you will  " Suspend your Quarrels and be still  " Let Wits shake Hands with one another  " And ev'ry Dunce embrace his Brother  " From batter'd Bards with ne'er a Shoe  " To those who strut about with two  " From Poets doom'd to whittle Sticks  " To Rhimers in a Coach and Six  " Let none presume to fret and squabble  " Nor curse the dirty rhiming Rabble  " For see the Beams of  Phoebus  strike  " The Meadows Hills and Dales alike  " So shines the Muse on ev'ry Creature  " Who tags his humble Lines with Metre  He saidThe Children of the Bays  Sent up a Shout of mingled Praise  Devoutly promising to pay  Obedience to the Prince of Day  And now they see the Tables spread  With Dainties and  Parnassian  Bread  Whose tiny Loaves were nicely white  And no  French  Rolls were half so light  The first bold Course was brought along  In Dishes made of  Homer  's Song  Next  Virgil  on the Table shines  And then smooth  Ovid  's tender Lines  The gay Desert expos'd to view  Of modern Authors not a few  Heroicks in the midst preside  With Elegy on either Side  Here through transparent Sonnets gleam  WhipSyllabubs and spiced Cream  There loaded Epigrams appear  And little Mottos close the Rear  Now Dinner past their jolly Souls  Cut Capers to the  Nectar  Bowls  Till ev'ry Bard had drank his fill  And then they left the tuneful Hill  But ere they part the laurel'd King  Extracted from a wond'rous Spring  A magick Bath of mighty Pow'r  Whose Virtues could in half an Hour  Make Proof against sharp Satyr's Pain  The Fibres of a Dunce's Brain  And give him Confidence to push  Through the broad World without a Blush  Apollo  next upon the Crew  Bestow'd a Greygoose Quill or two  With Ink that into Metre runs  And charms against the Fear of Duns  This done dismiss'd 'em as before  With Sirs your Servant and no more  The FALL of LUCIA  LUCIA was fair and bright as rising Day  Sweet as  Arabia  or the Buds of  May  Fresh as the Winds that sweep the dewy Hills  Or Beds of Roses wash'd by healthy Rills  Whose Soul was softer than a trembling Dove  Nor knew a Failing till she learn'd to love  Nor Fraud nor Scandal to her Lips were known  And thought each Bosom guiltless as her own  Thus only arm'd with Innocence and Smiles  She fell the Victim of a Tyrant's Wiles  So lost from Shepherd and its mourning Dam  Through some lone Desart roves a stragg'ling Lamb  No Danger fears but as he idly strays  Round ev'ry Bush the heedless Wanton plays  Till raging Wolves the beauteous Toy surround  Or foaming Tigers rend the mossy Ground  Then from his Heart the guiltless Purple flows  A grateful Morsel to his hungry Foes  Thus wrap'd in Sorrows wretched  Lucia  lies  Whose Sighs still answer to her streaming Eyes  And  Damon  stillAh faithless  Damon  cries  No more those Lips like dewy Roses glow  Her weary Lids no peaceful Slumbers know  But left to strike her pensive Breast in vain  And curse the Author of her lasting Pain  Her Soul of Ease has took its long Adieu  Hear this ye Nymphs but hear and tremble too  Ye Fair that lanch in Pleasure's tempting Sea  Though Fortune crowns you with a calmer Day  And Joy's soft Gale salutes your nimble Oar  Where  Lucia  's Fame was shipwreck'd on the Shore  Yet let Reflexion mark your gliding Days  Nor drink too deeply in the Draught of Praise  For Flatt'ry is"So say the learned Schools  " The Bane of Virgins and the Bait of Fools"  How happy she whose purer Spirit knows  No Thought less harmless than a Saint's Repose  Whose guiltless Charms pursue no greater End  But to rejoice a Parent or a Friend  Whose Care it is her Passions to control  And keep the Steerage of a quiet Soul  Then this shall grace her monumental Page  " In Youth admir'd and belov'd in Age"  The CRUCIFIXION and RESURRECTION  An ODE  I  WHAT means the reeling Earth O why  These Wonders in the dreadful Sky  The frighted Sun withdraws its Beams  Deep Groans are heard and doleful Screams  O say what this Convulsion means  Afflicted Nature with a Shriek replies  A God expires a mighty Saviour dies  II  The conscious Stars their Rays deny  The Moon receives a crimson Dye  The Temple conscious of its Fall  Now shakes its emblematick Wall  The Ocean stagnates and the Mountains bow  And Angels weep that never wept till now  III  Still tremble Earth and still O Sky  Thy everchearing Lamps deny  Amaz'd still let the Ocean stand  But what remains for guilty Man  What Groans what Sorrows are for him decreed  For Man whose Crimes have made Perfection bleed  IV  But see O see the Sun returns  No more afflicted Nature mourns  The Stars their vacant Orbs regain  And the Moon sheds a silver Beam  While heav'nly Voices warble in the Skies  " Behold your Saviour from his Tomb arise"  V  While Saints attend the blessed Morn  He roseThe God in human Form  A Form not made of vulgar Clay  Which tho' it slept cou'd not decay  Hail Mortals Hail transported Seraphs cry  Redeem'd and favour'd by the God most high  VI  In Heav'n let Joys eternal flow  And Mercy in the Worlds below  The Penitent shall Peace obtain  And not a Tear shall fall in vain  Then join ye Worlds in one glad Chorus sing  Praise to Messiah and th' Almighty King  The Third Chapter of the Wisdom of SOLOMON  From the First to the Sixth Verse  THUS sung the Man for Wisdom long renown'd  What mean these Tears and mournful Numbers round  Is Death the Cause Ah then restrain your Tears  That stubborn Monarch nor regard nor hears  And the blest Shades for whom you vainly mourn  To these dim Regions wou'd no more return  Wrap'd in bright Visions they no Ills endure  From Sin from Danger and from Death secure  'Tis past The parting Struggles are no more  They now are landed on the blissful Shore  Where no pale Fears nor sullen Sorrows dwell  But Joys beyond what mortal Tongues can tell  Where smiling Hope for ever blooms around  And growing Pleasures that shall know no Bound  When thoughtless Mortals by constraint attend  On the last Moments of their parting Friend  See the chang'd Features wear a deathful Hue  The Temples water'd with a fainting Dew  The Limbs that tremble with convulsive Pain  Then stand agast the ignorant and vain  Who shiver at the seeming stern Decree  But look no farther than their Eyes can see  The happy Soul glides unobserv'd away  To Worlds of Glory and eternal Day  The Pains and Sorrows which the Virtuous know  Which long had bid the Tears in secret flow  Shall not be lost nor bury'd in the Ground  But serve to brighten their immortal Crown  From that great Being they shall find their Pay  Who blest the rising and the closing Day  When the pure Spirit from its Prison flies  How joy the Seraphs in their brighter Skies  Around their Guest the shining Guards attend  And heav'nly Harps with heav'nly Voices blend  ESSAY on HAPPINESS  NOTHING dear Madam nothing is more true  Than a short Maxim much approv'd by you  The Lines are these "We by Experience know  " Within ourselves exists our Bliss or Woe"  Tho' round our Heads the Goods of Fortune roll  Dazzle they may but cannot chear the Soul  Content the Fountain of eternal Joy  Can Riches purchase or can Want destroy  No Born of Heav'n its Birth it will maintain  No Slave to Power nor the Prize of Gain  Say who can buy what never yet was sold  No Wealth can bribe her nor no Bonds can hold  Sometimes she deigns to shine in lofty Halls  But found more frequent in a Cottage Walls  Her Flight from thence too often is decreed  Then Poverty is doubly curs'd indeed  Content and Bliss which differ but in Name  Alike their Natures and their End the same  Fast bound together in eternal Chains  This as the EndThe other as the Means  Will ne'er divide But who enjoys the one  Must find the other ere the setting Sun  Then where Ah where do these fair Sisters fly  Beneath the northern or the southern Sky  Courts do they love The Senate or the Town  Or the still Village and the healthful Down  Say do they like  Humilo  's humble Vest  Or the gay Diamonds on  Belinda  's Breast  To none of these alas are they confin'd  But the still Bosom and the virtuous Mind  See  Glaro  feated on his gilded Car  Whose stubborn Passions wage continual War  Who cannot call that ravag'd Heart his own  Where Vice and Virtue struggle for the Throne  See Rage appearing in that hostile Frown  Now Fears distract him and now Pleasures drown  Now turns to Heav'n with repentant Tears  But the next Hour at his Chaplain sneers  This day a Beast the next a reas'ning Man  Behold him right then envy if you can  Pale  Livia  tooWho pants beneath the weight  Of irksom Jewels and afflicting State  Whose Glass and Pillow do her Time divide  At once oppress'd with Sickness and with Pride  The shapely Stays her aking Ribs confine  And in her Ears the sparkling Pendents shine  Yet not a Joy the tortur'd Wretch can feel  Beyond  Ixion  on his rolling Wheel  See restless  Cloe  fond to be admir'd  Of Joy impatient and as quickly tir'd  When first her Eyelids open on the Day  With eager haste she gobbles down her Tea  And to the Park commands her rolling Wheels  Yet sighs and wishes for the rural Fields  Then back to Cards and Company she flies  Then for the Charms of melting Musick dies  At Eve the Play Assembly or the Ball  She hates them singly yet wou'd grasp 'em all  With languid Spirits and appal'd Desires  She to her Closet and her Book retires  But Solitude offends the sprightly Fair  Reading she loaths and Thought she cannot bear  Then to her Chamber and her Couch she flies  Where gilded Chariots swim before her Eyes  In vain for Sleep she folds her weary Arms  Who wou'd be  Cloe  to enjoy her Charms  In yonder Path Sir  Thrifty  we behold  With Beaver drooping and with Garments old  Whose dirty Linen shews no Mark of Pride  Nor sparkling Laces deck his slender Side  Whose heavy Soul a saucy Wit wou'd swear  Was made exactly to his easy Chair  Whose tasteless Senses ask for nothing new  Whose Meals are temp'rate and whose pleasures few  " Is this Man blestHe may be soBut when  " Why when his Thousands rise to number ten  " From ten to twenty and from twentyHold  " To one round Million of bright Sterling Gold"  Not there we stop for Avarice will crave  Till it shall meet with its grand Cure the Grave  Lavinia  's blest with all that Man desires  With Eyes that charm and Reason that inspires  Youth Wealth and Friends to gild her shining Days  The poor Man's Blessing and the rich Man's Praise  With Judgment sound and touch'd by no extreme  Speech gently flowing and a Soul serene  For ever pleasing and for ever true  By all admir'd envy'd by a few  Then she is happy tho' beneath the Sky  Hold not so hastyLet her Husband die  Then who are happy 'twill be hard to say  Since undisturb'd it seldom lasts a Day  For who in Smiles beholds the Morning Sun  May weed before his shortliv'd Journey's done  All Pleasures satiate and all Objects cloy  We crave we grasp but loath the tasted Joy  Nor Wealth nor Beauty Friend's nor Fortune's Smile  Can bless our Moments tho' they may beguile  Nor Wit with Happiness can often grow  A helpless Friend if not an arrant Foe  Where then O where shall Happiness be found  Say shall we search the rolling World around  On borrow'd Pinions travel through the Sky  Or to the Centre drive our piercing Eye  Cease busy Fool Is Happiness thy Care  Pierce thy own Breast and thou wilt find it there  Drive thence the Passions and the Guilt expel  And call fair Virtue to the polish'd Cell  Call soft Content with all her smiling Train  Peace for thy Health and Patience for thy Pain  Then not till then O Man thy Heart shall know  Bliss so ador'd but seldom found below  An ESSAY on HOPE  TO you who ne'er the willing Verse refuse  Thus sings an humble but a grateful Muse  Our Theme is Hopebut of a diff'rent kind  The Bane or Blessing of the subject Mind  This dawning Joy that to the Soul was given  As a short Earnest of its future Heav'n  To blame is not the Purpose of my Song  But warn our Sisters not to place it wrong  Shun trifling Hope that bids your Fancy roll  The constant Torment of a restless Soul  For two pale Handmaids are for ever near  Sick Disappointment and the secret Tear  'Tis this that makes the restless Heart repine  Beneath the Treasures of an  Indian  Mine  Much Fortune givesYet  Give us more  they cry  And some new Prospect lures the dazzl'd Eye  Like wanton Babes they reach at something more  And drop the Gewgaws which they held before  See the puff'd Tradesman strut before his Door  Whose Birth was humble and whose Fortune poor  Yet you may see his roving Thoughts depend  On some bold Venture or some wealthy Friend  Till the lost Bankrupt drops into the Jaw  Of pale Discredit and voracious Law  The gravefac'd Student better learn'd than fed  With Store of Logick in his aking Head  Sees pleasing Pictures in his Bosom drawn  The Dean's soft Cushion and the Bishop's Lawn  He dines with Lords and takes the highest Place  And weds a Countess Cousin to his Grace  But soon his Heart the lost Delusion mourns  And the proud Prelate to a Curate turns  On some dark Dome with thirty Pounds  perann  He sips his Liquors in a pewter Cann  Young  Seizum  fated to distract the Law  Who talks of Men and Books he never saw  Now struts a Counsellor a Serjeant now  While the quick Turns elate his scornful Brow  Behold the Judge in that commanding Frown  See then just then he strok'd his Ermin'd Gown  Cecilia  soft whose pleasing Features shine  Bright in their Wane and beauteous in Decline  Still to her eyes recalls the scatter'd Darts  Still hopes the Conquest of a thousand Hearts  Care stalks around Vexation hovers nigh  Her Friends bewail her and her Children cry  Her wounded Ears their hateful Whinings tire  Whose Fancy dwells upon a wealthy 'Squire  Wrap'd in soft Visions on her Couch she lies  Knights Peers and Garters swim before her Eyes  She rides in triumph through her Husband's Fields  And hears the rattling of her Chariot Wheels  Till her charm'd Senses will contain no more  Then flies the Vision through its Iv'ry Door  See  Acamas  with Time's sad Burden bow  Guilt in his Breast and Wrinkles on his Brow  Yet points out  Cloe  for his charming Bride  And fain would tempt her to his frozen Side  At Chapel where soft Grace and Virtue calls  And pale Vice trembles at the sacred Walls  Where Conscience warns the guilty Wretch to pray  And beg a Blessing on his closing Day  The Preacher reads But  Acamas  the while  Grins at his  Cloe  with a ghastly Smile  In their red Orbs his waiting Eyeballs roll  And Charming  Cloe  rushes on his Soul  But Death will teach the silverbearded Fool  Some other Lesson in his gloomy School  Blank Disappointment with its Train attends  In  Delia  's Heart if  Delia  's Heart depends  On  Silia  's Tongue so aptly hung with Guile  On  Cynthio  's Friendship or on  Clara  's Smile  Such courtly Friends are like the show'ry Bow  Ting'd with false Lustre by Reflexion glow  Like its faint Rays they hardly last an Hour  Lost in a Cloud or melted in a Show'r  If trifling Hope has any room to plead  'Tis that where Nature's simple Dictates lead  So the wet Hind who travels o'er the Plain  Through the cold Mire and afflicting Rain  Tho' his low Roofs with trickling Show'rs run  May hope next Morn to see the chearful Sun  Or when keen Hunger at the ev'ning Tide  Drives home the Shepherd to his rustick Bride  His honest Reason haply might not stray  Tho' he should dream of Dumpling all the way  See sad  Aemilia  doom'd by fatal Vows  To the harsh Usage of a Tyrant Spouse  To see his Mistress in her Woes rejoice  Her Fortune wasted on his guilty Choice  To bear Reproaches doubled on her Ear  Yet only answer with a silent Tear  Tho' patient Wives must wait the Fate's good time  Yet she I think may hope without a Crime  But the grand Hope that yields perpetual Joy  No trifles gave no trifles can destroy  With Mercy from the blest Abode it came  Its Birth Celestial and its End the same  That bids our Days in one smooth Tenor roll  Its task to chear and harmonize the Soul  On smarting Want it pours a healing Balm  Makes Toil seem pleasant and Affliction calm  The MORAL VISION  TYRANNICK Winter's Iron Reign was done  And the soft Twins receiv'd the radiant Sun  The chearful Earth appear'd in vernal Pride  And the clear Waves did more serenely glide  Kind  Zephyrs  play'd around the waving Trees  While op'ning Roses caught the welcome Breeze  Amid these Scenes beneath a Maple Shade  Sat careless  Mira  on her Elbow laid  While frolick Fancy led the usual Train  Of gaudy Phantoms through her cheated Brain  Till Slumber seiz'd upon her thoughtful Breast  And the still Spirits sunk in balmy Rest  But while her Eyes had bid the World farewel  Thus  Mira  dream'd and thus her Dreams we tell  A seeming Nymph like those of  Dian  's Train  Came swiftly tripping o'er the flow'ry Plain  Whose smiling Face was as the Morning fair  A silver Fillet ty'd her flaxen Hair  A golden Zone her lovely Bosom bound  And her green Robe hung careless on the Ground  Sleep happy Mortal with a Smile she cries  And turn'd on  Mira  her farbeaming Eyes  Still o'er thy own aerial Mountains stray  And in bright Visions slumber out the Day  With gaudy Scenes delude thy dazzl'd Mind  Yet thou must wake and leave 'em all behind  Yes thou shalt drop from that enchanted Sky  And wake to Wisdom with a weeping Eye  While in a Mist the shining Prospects end  Then hear O  Mira  thy immortal Friend  Recall thy wand'ring Thoughts and make 'em dwell  In the small Limits of their native Cell  To thine own Heart confine thy chiefest Care  For  Mira  know thy Joys are planted there  And as you manage and improve the Soil  'Twill punish your Neglect or pay your Toil  Here let your Views and your Ambition rest  To reign the Queen of a wellgovern'd Breast  This Point secur'd let Heav'n dispose the rest  Yet you may ask for what your State requires  But not the Gewgaws your Caprice desires  As thus 'O keep me from the reach of Pain  ' From meagre Famine and her mournful Train  ' Let not Reproach assault my wounded Ears  ' Nor let my Soul behold a Friend in Tears  ' Secure from Noise let my still Moments run  ' And still be chearful as the rising Sun  ' Or if a Gloom my trembling Heart invades  ' Ah may it vanish with the nightly Shades  ' Through the craz'd Walls O may not Reason fly  ' But if it does then let its Mansion die  ' Let not Remorse of Guilt the certain Pay  ' Blot my clea  Sun nor stain its parting Ray  ' Give me a lively but a guiltless Mind  ' A Body healthful and a Soul resign'd  Thus far O  Mira  thou mayst ask of Heav'n  How bless'd the Mortal to whom these are giv'n  If such thy Lot let Kings enjoy their Crowns  Their pageant State and arbitrary Frowns  Who tho' encircl'd by their shining Slaves  Intriguing Friends and well dissembl'd Knaves  Are only wretched Idols plac'd on high  To bear the Rage of a tempestuous Sky  And while the Storms around his Temples blow  His fawning Servants safely sneer below  But now the Sun brings on the Noon of Day  Rise  Mira  rise and shun the scorching Ray  This said no more appear'd the beauteous Maid  And  Mira  waking found a lonely Shade  A PRAYER for the YEAR    ALMIGHTY Wisdom at whose Nod  The Stars shall cease to shine  Great Nature's Father Guide and God  O let me call thee mine  Yet not for me and me alone  Thy Mercies I implore  No let that Bliss to all be known  That tremble and adore  Now Fear that makes the Sorrows flow  Ev'n from the Infant's Eyes  O'erwhelms in one promiscuous Woe  The Ignorant and Wise  Then hear O hear thy Servants cry  We beg thy saving Hand  To whom but Heav'n shou'd we apply  To raise a drooping Land  Be thou the Guard of helpless Age  The wretched Orphan's Friend  O smooth the Face of hostile Rage  And spare its purple End  Restrain the Hand of threat'ning Pride  Asswage the cruel Breast  Teach Mercy to the Victor Side  And Patience to the rest  And when the Sword of Conquest shall  The trembling Wretch arraign  Let Justice guide the equal Scale  Nor swerve the steady Beam  Preserve the merciful and kind  From Violence and Pain  And let the meek and gentle Mind  Rejoice and not complain  Nor let the barb'rous Steel invade  The Breast of hoary Age  Nor give the unresisting Babe  A Prey to purple Rage  Amongst unnumber'd Worlds if I  Am worth my Maker's Care  Then let me live and let me die  Unwounded by Despair  Tho' Want or Peril Pain or Death  Assault this feeble Clay  Let Hope attend my latest Breath  And chear the gloomy Way  Preserve my Parent and my Friend  From Danger Guilt or Shame  In Peace their chearful Days extend  To praise thy holy Name  Forgive the Errors of my Youth  If in my Youth I fall  Or teach my Age thy saving Truth  O hear me when I call  Thou mighty Lord of all above  And all beneath the Sun  Thy Servant's humble Suit approve  If not thy Will be done  DAVID'S Complaint ii Samuel chap  MOURN  Judab  mourn beneath the silent Sky  And pierce the Deserts with thy midnight Cry  See  Zion  conscious of her failing Powers  Heaves from her Base and shakes the nodding Bowers  For their lost Sires orphan'd Babes complain  And Matrons strike their widow'd Breasts in vain  From Street to Street the howling Mourners fly  Fear on their Brows and Horror in their Eye  For why her Peers are wash'd with purple Gore  Her Princes and her Monarch is no more  Whom not the sacred Diadem cou'd shield  But serv'd to swell the Horrors of the Field  But why amongst the Heathen doom'd to fall  Is this alas the End of mighty  Saul  Mourn mourn in Silence lest  Philistia  hear  Nor let our Foes behold the streaming Tear  But O my FriendAh there my Sorrows swell  Deny'd the Blessing of a sad Farewel  Whose ruddy Cheeks confess'd their early Prime  Nor his smooth Brows had felt the Stroke of Time  He was my Soul's best Pleasure while alive  And is he blastedthen do I survive  Ah no 'tis Death and aggravated Woe  O say my Heart canst thou sustain the Blow  Ye Nations mournif such a thing cou'd be  Till Nature too shou'd learn to grieve like me  Ye smiling Dames your gaudy Robes resign  And suit your Garments and your Griefs to mine  Go hide your slighted Beauties from the Sun  While down your Cheeks the streaming Sorrows run  Still let your Eyeballs waste their humid Store  And still repeatYour Monarch is no more  Be thou  Gilboä  wrap'd in endless Night  Nor let thy Hills behold the Beams of Light  Let the gay Sun to thee his Rays deny  While rattling Tempests o'er thy Borders fly  There  Judah  's Chief lay prostrate on the Ground  And there my Friend receiv'd the mortal Wound  ESSAY on FRIENDSHIP  TO  Artemisia  'Tis to her we sing  For her once more we touch the sounding String  'Tis not to  Cythera  's Reign nor  Cupid  's Fires  But sacred Friendship that our Muse inspires  A Theme that suits  Aemilia  's pleasing Tongue  So to the Fair Ones I devote my Song  The Wise will seldom credit all they hear  Tho' saucy Wits shou'd tell them with a Sneer  That Womens Friendships like a certain Fly  Are hatch'd i'th Morning and at Ev'ning die  'Tis true our Sex has been from early Time  A constant Topick for Satirick Rhyme  Nor without Reasonsince we're often found  Or lost in Passion or in Pleasures drown'd  And the fierce Winds that bid the Ocean roll  Are less inconstant than a Woman's Soul  Yet some there are who keep the mod'rate Way  Can think an Hour and be calm a Day  Who ne'er were known to start into a Flame  Turn Pale or tremble at a losing Game  Run  Chloe  's Shape or  Delia  's Features down  Or change Complexion at  Celinda  's Gown  But still serene compassionate and kind  Walk through Life's Circuit with an equal Mind  Of all Companions I would choose to shun  Such whose blunt Truths are like a bursting Gun  Who in a Breath count all your Follies o'er  And close their Lectures with a mirthful Roar  But Reason here will prove the safest Guide  Extremes are dang'rous plac'd on either Side  A Friend too soft will hardly prove sincere  The Wit's inconstant and the Learn'd severe  GoodBreeding Wit and Learning all conspire  To charm Mankind and make the World admire  Yet in a Friend but serve an under Part  The main Ingredient is an honest Heart  By this can  Urs'la  all our Souls subdue  Which wanting this not  Sylvia  's Charms can do  Now let the Muse who takes no Courtier's Fee  Point to her Friendand future Ages see  If this shall live 'till future Ages be  One Line devoted to  Fidelia  's Praise  The lov'd Companion of my early Days  Whouse harmless Thoughts are sprightly as her Eyes  By Nature chearful and by Nature wise  To have them last the social Laws decree  We choose our Friendships in the same degree  What mighty Pleasure if we might presume  To strut with Freedom in  Arvida  's Room  Or share the Table what supreme Delight  With some proud Dutchess or a scornful Knight  To sit with formal and assenting Face  For who shall dare to contradict her Grace  Our freeborn Nature hates to be confin'd  Where State and Power check the speaking Mind  Where heavy Pomp and sullen Form withholds  That chearful Ease and Sympathy of Souls  But yet the Soul whate'er its Partner do  Must lift its Head above the baser Crew  Celestial Friendship with its nicer Rules  Frequents not Dunghills nor the Clubs of Fools  It asks to make this Union soft and long  A Mind susceptible and Judgment strong  And then a Taste But let that Taste be giv'n  By mighty Nature and the Stamp of Heav'n  Possest of these the justly temper'd Flame  Will glow incessant and be still the same  Not mov'd by Sorrow Sickness or by Age  To sullen Coldness or distemper'd Rage  The Soul unstain'd with Envy or with Pride  Pleas'd with itself and all the World beside  Unmov'd can see gilt Chariots whirling by  Or view the wretched with a melting Eye  Discern a Failing and forgive it too  Such  Artemisia  we may find in you  Be seldom sour or your Friends will fly  From the hung Forehead and the scornful Eye  Nor like  Aurelia  in the Morning kind  And soft as Summer or the western Wind  But round ere night her giddy Passions wheel  She'll clap the Door against your parting Heel  An even Temper will be sure to please  With cool Reflexion and a chearful Ease  But see  Armida  's unfrequented Rooms  How vainly spread with Carpets and Perfumes  All shun her like the Cocatrice's Beams  And for no other Reason but her loath'd Extremes  Today more holy than a cloister'd Nun  Almost an Atheist by tomorrow's Sun  Now speaks to Heaven with a lifted Eye  Now to her Footman You're a Rogue and lye  O say from what strange Principles begin  These odd Compounds of Piety and Sin  A sickly Fair may some Excuses find  What grieves the Body will affect the Mind  But not the Creatures who have learn'd to screen  Their own Illnature in the name of Spleen  What the black Mists afflict the aking Skull  The Spirits tremble and the Heart be dull  Have you from thence a Licence to offend  Affront a Patron or abuse a Friend  And ape the Manners of a surly Beast  Because 'tis cloudy and the Wind's i'th' East  But all have Failings not the best are free  Or in a greater or a less Degree  What follows thenForgive or unforgiven  Expect no Passage at the Gate of Heav'n  Kind Nature gave in Pity to Mankind  This social Virtue to the human Mind  This gives our Pleasures a more easy Flow  And helps to blunt the Edge of smarting Woe  The Soul's Relief with Grief or Cares opprest  Is to disclose them to a faithful Breast  And then how lovely in a Friend appear  The mournful Sigh and sympathizing Tear  When changing Fortune with propitious Ray  Gilds the brown Ev'ning or the smiling Day  The pleas'd Companion shares the welcome Tide  And wrap'd in Joy the happy Minutes glide  Grave Authors differMen of Sense incline  This Way or thatOpinions rarely join  Their Thoughts will vary Why Because they're free  But most in this and only this agree  That our chief Task is seldom to offend  And Life's great Blessing a wellchosen Friend  The MISTAKEN LOVER  STREPHON the sprightly and the gay  Lov'd  Celia  fresh and fair as  May  None shone so brilliant in the Mall  The Court th' Assembly and the Ball  None bare at  Will  's the laurel'd Prize  But  Celia  with the killing Eyes  'Twas at the Drawing Room or Play  But which our Author cannot say  As  Celia  roll'd her Eyes around  This Youth receiv'd a mortal Wound  What shou'd he do"Commence the Beau  " For Women oft are caught by Show"  The wounded  Strephon  now behold  Array'd in Coat of Green and Gold  Of which we something might advance  The Sleeve was  alamode de France  We leave it hereand haste to tell  How smartly round his Temples fell  The modish WigYet we presume  More graceful was the scarlet Plume  Tho' some rude Soldier doom'd to bear  The Southern and the Northern Air  And walk through ev'ry kind of Weather  Might jeer at  Strephon  's scarlet Feather  And tell us such shou'd ne'er be wore  Unless you fought at  Marstonmoor  His Person finish'd now the Care  Is to address and gain the Fair  He purchas'd all the Songs of Note  And got the Lover's Cant by rote  He brib'd her Footmen and her Maids  And with his nightly Serenades  Her vaulted Roofs and Gardens rung  For her he ogled danc'd and sung  Was often at her Toilet seen  With Sonnets to the  Paphian  Queen  Then at her Feet dejected lying  Praying weeping sighing dying  " Was  Celia  kind" It shall be known  D'ye think our Hearts are made of Stone  Yes she was kind and to proceed  The Writings drawn and Friends agreed  Grave  Hymen  's sacred Knot was ty'd  And  Celia  Fair commenc'd a Bride  But I shall pass the Weddingday  Nor stay to paint the Ladies gay  Nor Splendor of the lighted Hall  The Feast the Fiddles nor the Ball  A lovely Theme'Tis true but then  We'll leave it to a softer Pen  Those transient Joys will fade too soon  We'll therefore skip the HonyMoon  'Twas half a YearIt might be more  Since  Celia  brought her shining Store  Five thousand Pounds of Sterling clear  To bless the Mansion of her Dear  Some tell us Wives their Beauties lose  When they have spoil'd their bridal Shoes  Some learned Casuists make it clear  A Wife might please for half a Year  And others say her Charms will hold  As long as the suspended Gold  But that her Bloom is soon decay'd  And wither'd when her Fortune's paid  Now which of these was  Celia  's Case  Tho' all are common to her Race  I shall not rack my Brains about  But leave the Learn'd to pick it out  This Husband whimsical and gay  Lov'd Musick Masquerades and Play  Was one of those most happy Elves  That dote upon their charming Selves  Who hating dull domestick Walls  Fly here and there as Fancy calls  Still in pursuit of something new  Nor even to their Vices true  Mistaken  Strephon  finds no more  His  Celia  charming as before  Her EyesWhy they have lost their Fire  The Roses on her Cheek expire  Her Shape'Tis alter'd strangely sure  Her Voice no Mortal can endure  Then to the Park where  Claudia  rolls  Her Eyes to fish for shallow Souls  Or at the Play he must appear  For lovely  Lindamine  is there  No mortal Bell so fair as she  If wretched  Strephon  was but free  I'th' Country he deludes the Morn  With Ringwood and the hunting Horn  Perhaps may with his Dearest dine  Then hey for Company and Wine  Wine that wou'd make an Hermit gay  With Musick intermix'd and Play  For Tables and for Cards they call  The Dicebox rattles in the Hall  Now all are happy nor give o'er  Till Watches point to Number Four  Then see the Face of dawning Day  Here  Lucy  "Where's your Lady pray  " She's gone to restThere let her be  " Go make the crimson Bed for me"  All this a while in Silence pass'd  The Lady's Patience fail'd at last  One Morning so the Fates decree  Alone was sitting he and she  Not yet arriv'd the roaring Band  Nor Rake nor Coxcomb was at hand  This blest Occasion pleas'd the Fair  And with a mild and chearful Air  She thus began "My  Strephon  say  " Why this dejected Face to day  " Why art thou always cross and dull  " Unless the noisy Rooms are full  " Black Discontent and Anger lies  " Close lurking in thy sullen Eyes  " Those Eyes that I with Sorrow see  " Disgusted when they roll on me  Here ceas'd the greatly injur'd Bride  And  Strephon  with a Blush reply'd  " Why Madam I must own that you  " Have Merit give the De'l his due  " And was the Pleasure of my Life  " Before you wore the Name of Wife  " But Ma'm the Reason was I find  " That while a Lover I was blind  " And now the Fault is not in me  " 'Tis only thisthat I can see  I thought you once a Goddess trim  " The Graces dwelt on ev'ry Limb  " But Madam if you e'er was such  " Methinks you're alter'd very much  " As first I beg your Pardon tho'  " You hold your Head extremely low  " And tho' your Shape is not awry  " Your Shoulders stand prodigious high  " Your curling Hair I durst have swore  " Was blacker than the sable Moor  " But now I find 'tis only brown  " A Colour common through the Town  " 'Tis true you're mighty fairBut now  " I spy a Freckle on your Brow  " Your Lips I own are red and thin  " But there's a Pimple on your Chin  " Besides your Eyes are grayAlack  " 'Till now I always thought 'em black  " Thus Madam I the Truth have told  " 'Tis true I thank you for your Gold  " But find in searching of my Breast  " That I cou'd part with all the rest  He ceas'dAnd both were mute a while  'Till  Celia  answer'd with a Smile  " Who would have thought my Dear says she  " That Love was blind to this degree  " But in my Turn I'll own it too  " That I'm as much deceiv'd as you  " From hence let our Example show  " The gay Coquette and sprightly Beau  " That Love like theirs will never hold  " Not tho' 'tis cemented with Gold  " Let all the Youths to you repair  " For Counseland to me the Fair  " 'Twill help to make our  Strephons  wise  " And stop the Growth of tender Lies  " And more than  Plato  's moral Page  " Instruct the  Celia's  of the Age  " But now my Dearest as you see  " In mutual Hatred we agree  " Methinks 'tis better we retreat  " Each Party to a distant Seat  " And tho' we value each the other  " Just as one Rush regards another  " Yet let us often send to hear  " If Health attend the absent Dear  " And tho' each other we would shun  " As Debtors do a hateful Dun  " Nor mind the crossing of a Street  " Yet let's be civil when we meet  " And live in short like courtly Friends  " They partand thus the Story ends  The WAY of the WORLD  SOME Herbs there are whose deadly Juices fill  The Heart with Venom and directly kill  Some operate more slowly but as sure  The Dart

artful Smile  That Womens Eyes were giv'n them to beguile  His Way is cunning and mischievous too  He'll praise in others what he finds in you  You hear delighted nor perceive the Foe  But drink in Flatt'ry ere you think 'tis so  And when he's run the gay Description through  The smart Conclusion is apply'd to you  But turn your Back  Alcidas  with a Grin  Will vow you're ugly as a Sooterkin  How oft you hear from a designing Knave  Sir I'm your Servant Madam I'm your Slave  Yet if you're blest with penetrating Eyes  You'll in his Features read the Villain lies  See soft  Courtine  whose Hat with Silver bound  Is so obsequious that 'twill kiss the Ground  Whose Actions point to some unworthy End  And ne'er was Patron Counsellor or Friend  Whose narrow Views are to himself confin'd  Yet he's the humble Slave of all Mankind  These fawning Rogues are irksom CreaturesTrue  But then a Clown is full as odious too  The Face unpractis'd in the Arts of Guile  Need not be stretech'd with an eternal Smile  Nor yet affect the Cynick's awful Scowl  Screw'd like the Visage of  Minerva  's Owl  For some reject and hold it as a Rule  The Crabfaced Student for the tender Fool  The Phrase unstudied flows with graceful Ease  And careless Gesture never fails to please  The Heart instructs the Features and the Tongue  Let that be right and these will ne'er be wrong  Ask  Cynthio  's Judgment in some nice Affair  He'll praise your Conduct with a charming Air  Extol your Sense and Prudence to the Skies  " And sure such Merits were design'd to rise"  His candid Eyes can hidden Beauties see  Ev'n Faults are useful or they cease to be  And each nomeaning  Cynthio  can explore  But asks his Friendship and he speaks no more  But the worst Flatterer that wears a Tongue  Is him whose Power aggravates the Wrong  To whose grand Levee Crowds of Suppliants run  And bow like  Persians  to the rising Sun  Where starv'd Dependents linger out their Days  Yet proud to share his Snuffbox and his Praise  Grow stiff with Standing and with Staring thin  To watch the Dimple on their Patron's Chin  Who with a Nod can make the Wretch believe  And smiles on Hunger which he'll ne'er

a fair and healthy Plain  There liv'd a poor but honest Swain  Had to his Lot a little Ground  Defended by a quickset Mound  'Twas there he milk'd his brindled Kine  And there he fed his harmless Swine  His Pigeons flutter'd to and fro  And bask'd his Poultry in a Row  Much we might say of each of these  As how his Pigs in Consort wheeze  How the sweet Hay his Heifers chew  And how the Pigeons softly coo  But we shall wave this motley Strain  And keep to one that's short and plain  Nor paint the Dunghill's feather'd King  For of the Hen we mean to sing  A Hen there was a strange one too  Cou'd sing believe me it is true  Or rather as you may presume  Wou'd prate and cackle in a Tune  This quickly spread the Pullet's Fame  And Birds and Beasts together came  All mixt in one promiscuous Throng  To visit Partlet and her Song  It chanc'd there came amongst the Crew  Of witty Foxes not a few  But one more smart than all the rest  His serious Neighbour thus addrest  ' What think you of this Partlet here  ' 'Tis true her Voice is pretty clear  ' Yet without pausing I can tell  ' In what much more she wou'd excel  ' Methinks she'd eat exceeding well  This heard the list'ning Hen as she  Sat perch'd upon a Mapletree  The shrewd Proposal gall'd her Pride  And thus to  Reynard  she reply'd  ' Sir you're extremely right I vow  ' But how will you come at me now  ' You dare not mount this lofty Tree  ' So there I'm pretty safe you see  ' From long ago or Record lies  ' You Foxes have been counted wise  ' But sure this Story don't agree  ' With your Device of eating me  ' For you Dame Fortune still intends  ' Some coarser Food than singing Hens  ' Besides e'er you can reach so high  ' Remember you must learn to fly  ' I own 'tis but a scurvy way  ' You have as yet to seize your Prey  ' By sculking from the Beams of Light  ' And robbing Henroosts in the Night  ' Yet you must keep this vulgar Trade  ' Of thieving till your Wings are made  ' Had I the keeping of you tho'  ' I'd make your subtle Worship know  ' We Chickens are your Betters due  ' Not fatted up for such as you  ' Shut up in Cub with rusty Chain  ' I'd make you lick your Lips in vain  ' And take a special Care be sure  ' No Pullet shou'd come near your Door  ' But try if you cou'd feed or no  ' Upon a Kite or Carrion Crow'  Here ceas'd the Hen The baffl'd Beast  March'd off without his promis'd Feast  The HEADACH  To AURELIA  AURELIA when your Zeal makes known  Each Woman's Failing but your own  How charming  Silvia  's Teeth decay  And  Celia  's Hair is turning gray  Yet  Celia  gay has sparkling Eyes  But to your Comfort is not wise  Methinks you take a world of pains  To tell us  Celia  has no Brains  Now you wise Folk who make such a pother  About the Wit of one another  With Pleasure wou'd your Brains resign  Did all your Noddles ach like mine  Not Cuckolds half my Anguish know  When budding Horns begin to grow  Nor batter'd Skull of wrestling  Dick  Who late was drubb'd at single Stick  Not Wretches that in Fevers fry  Not  Sappho  when her Cap's awry  E'er felt such tort'ring Pangs as I  Nor Forehead of Sir  Jeff'ry Strife  When smiling  Cynthio  kiss'd his Wife  Not lovesick  Marcia  's languid Eyes  Who for her simp'ring  Corin  dies  So sleepy look or dimly shine  As these dejected Eyes of mine  Nor  Claudia  's Brow such Wrinkles made  At sight of  Cynthia  's new Brocade  Just so  Aurelia  you complain  Of Vapours Rheums and gouty Pain  Yet I am patient so shou'd you  For Cramps and Headachs are our due  We suffer justly for our Crimes  For Scandal you and I for Rhymes  Yet we as harden'd Wretches do  Still the enchanting Vice pursue  Our Reformation ne'er begin  But fondly hug the Darling Sin  Yet there's a mighty diff'rence too  Between the Fate of me and you  Tho' you with tott'ring Age shall bow  And Wrinkles scar your lovely Brow  Your busy Tongue may still proclaim  The Faults of ev'ry sinful Dame  You still may prattle nor give o'er  When wretched I must sin no more  The sprightly Nine must leave me then  This trembling Hand resign its Pen  No Matron ever sweetly sung  Apollo  only courts the young  Then who wou'd not  Aurelia  pray  Enjoy his Favours while they may  Nor Cramps nor Headachs shall prevail  I'll still write on and you shall rail  STEPHON to CELIA  A modern LOVELETTER  MADAM  I HOPE you'll think it's true  I deeply

Gaunt Mastiffs at the Gate  All these had Ia happy Knave  As you may thinkbut with your Leave  A wretched Usurer was I  With hagard Jaws and eager Eye  That starv'd amidst unwieldy Store  And lost my Life in search of more  This  Pluto  saw and bid me go  Into the Carcase of a Beau  To taste of Pleasure and of Pains  With slender Purse and shallow Brains  My Wig behind was smartly ty'd  My silver Box with Snuff supply'd  On Books I seldom lov'd to pore  But sung and danc'd and aptly swore  Wheree'er I came the Ladies smil'd  This call'd me Pugand t'other Child  To please and to address the

her Rhymes to you  The Wound my Verses gave your Ear  Was undesign'd it will appear  Nor in the least the Fault of me  As by this Sorrow you may see  And cou'd I in our Meadows find  Among the vegetable Kind  A healing Simple that wou'd cure  Those smarting Pangs which you endure  Whose Juice the Matrons well esteem  For Cuts and Bruises that are green  I'd send it with an Heart most willing  Tho' it shou'd cost me half a Shilling  Yet I can serve you but in Will  For I've consulted Doctor  Pill  Who tells me that a Case like yours  Will not admit of common Cures  For that Incisions made by Rhymes  Are worse than Ulcers fifty times  He gives a Reason that is clear  Because they always strike the Ear  And give unutterable Pain  To the small Fibres of the Brain  Yet as the Doctor is my Friend  His Worship order'd me to send  This grand Receipt which he has known  To serve in Cases like your own  Tis true the Drug is something rare  And yet I wou'd not quite despair

TENPENNY NAIL  'TWAS past the Date of sav'ry Noon  And downwards roll'd the radiant Sun  When all except us rhyming Sinners  Had rosted boil'd and eat their Dinners  In my great Chair I sat to pout  And beat my weary Brains about  About what did not much avail  Amanda  's Riddle of the Nail  The Question was this  Where was the first Nail struck    When  Somnus  took me by Surprise  And put his Finger in my Eyes  'Twas He for Poets never nod  Without the Influence of a God  I dream'd of whatWhy you shall hear  Good People all I pray draw near  Methought there lay before my Eyes  A Nail of more than common Size  'Twas one that nails our Garden Door  And oft my Petticoat has tore  When sudden it is true my Friend  It rear'd itself and stood an end  And tho' no Mouth I cou'd descry  It talk'd as fast as you or I  And thus beganAs I am told  ' You Poets seldom deal in Gold  ' That's not the Price of empty Songs  ' But to Sir  Thrifty Gripe  belongs  ' Bright Silver is Sir  Wary  's Claim  ' And Copper for the lab'ring Dame  ' If so that each may have their due  ' We rusty Nails belong to you  ' I therefore ask as my Desert  ' I hope you bear a grateful Heart  ' You write my Lifeand be it shown  ' What strange Adventures I have known  ' I must confess I was not made  ' So early quite as  Adam  's Spade  ' Yet many Ages I have known  ' And double with my Labours grown  ' I occupy'd the first of all  ' A worthy Post at  GloomyHall  ' Where I with seven hundred more  ' Were hammer'd in the spacious Door  ' And there had haply stuck till now  ' Had not old  Simon  broke his Plough  ' Who seeing none but us at hand  ' And knowing us a trusty Band  ' Me with the Pincers sore oppress'd  ' And drew me headlong from the rest  ' My lazy Life alas was done  ' And now I toil'd from Sun to Sun  ' None pity me and none relieve  ' Till Fortune gave me a Reprieve  ' My Master broke his Plough again  ' And I from thence was dragg'd amain  ' To  Celia  's Chamber next I came  ' And bore a Glass with curious Frame  ' To whom the lovely Nymphs repair  ' There  Delia  spread her shining Hair  ' All smiling there was  Claudia  seen  ' And  Thalia  ty'd her Ribbands green  ' At last my Mistress drew too nigh  ' And some ill Genius standing by  ' Drove me directly in her Eye  ' Then I was banish'd from her Train  ' Hurl'd on a Dunghill with Disdain  ' But idle long I did not lie  ' For old Sir  Gripus  walking by  ' Who held it was a crying Sin  ' To trample o'er and slight a Pin  ' And that they well deserve a Jail  ' Who proudly scorn a rusty Nail  ' Carry'd me home and made secure  ' With mea stately oaken Door  ' Through the strong Boards he made me go  ' To keep his Daughter from a Beau  ' But she what is't but Love can do  ' With  Aquafortis  eat me through  ' A Cripple now and useless quite  ' I'm banish'd from the chearful Light  ' And all folk despise me that behold  ' At last I to a Smith was sold  ' Who had Compassion on my Pain  ' And brought me to myself again  ' To  Jeff'ry Bouze  I next belong  ' Where sparkling Ale was clear and strong  ' One Vault more precious than the rest  ' Was stow'd with Hogsheads of the best  ' And having lately lost the Key  ' He fast'ned up the Door with me  ' I stood a faithful Centry there  ' To guard the choice inspiring Beer  ' From thirsty  Bacchanalian  Rage  ' Till his Son  Guzzle  was of Age  ' At length the Youth an Entrance found  ' Tho' stoutly I maintain'd my Ground  ' Yet all my Strength wou'd not avail  ' For how cou'd one poor single Nail  ' Maintain a dang'rous Post you know  ' Against whole Legions of the Foe  ' Who well consid'ring Life's a Bubble  ' And drinking is the Cure of Trouble  ' And morethat he again could brew  ' Before the Date of Twenty two  ' While e'er that time the present Ale  ' Might happen to be flat or stale  ' He came himself with fifty more  ' And wisely drank it out before  ' It wou'd be tedious now to tell  ' What to your humble Slave befel  ' Amongst a rude mechanick Band  ' Till Fortune gave me to your Hand  ' Now if a proper Post I knew  ' I'd gladly be of use to you  ' But you resolve to hide no Pelf  ' And choose to walk abroad yourself  ' But  Mira  these are dang'rous Times  ' I'd have you fasten up your Rhymes  ' And 'tis the best thing you can do  ' To nail up Pens and Paper too  ' Do this and get thee gone to spinning  ' Or wisely dearn your Father's Linen"  This saida Cart with rumbling Sound  Came by and shook the trembling Ground  The Vision vanish'd from her Sight  And  Mira  waken'd in a Fright  The GENIUS in DISGUISE  AS I  Fidelia  and my Sire  Sat musing o'er a smoky Fire  We heard a Knocking at the Door  Rise something is the Matter sure  The little Turret seem'd to quake  The Shelves the Chairs and Tables shake  Fidelia  cries O what's the Matter  And  Mira  's Teeth began to chatter  The frighted Door as what could choose  Flew open pray believe the Muse  A hollow Voice for Entrance calls  And soonAlthough the dirty Walls  Were stain'd with Ignorance and Sin  Yet  Mira  's  Genius  ventur'd in  Not in a Cherub's Form enshrin'd  Nor in the shape of human kind  But Locks and Hinges round him glow  In Figure like a neat Buroe  Like Brambles in a thorny Gap  Stood  Mira  's Hair beneath her Cap  Her frighted Senses gone astray  She bent her Knees in act to pray  But the presuming Priest drew near  As void of Piety as Fear  And by its Side undaunted stood  And wou'd persuade us it was Wood  With Rev'rence then we did presume  To place him in the little Room  The Priest excluded with the rest  The Stranger  Mira  thus address'd  Tho' shaking with Surprise and Fear  ' O say what Power sent thee here  ' Not Fortune for I ne'er cou'd see  ' As yet her Favours bent on me  ' Nor Chance although we often find  ' She governs most of human kind  ' Or can against the Maid's Desire  ' Throw Madam's Caudle in the Fire  ' Can light a Candle or can miss  ' She never brought a thing like this  This said pale  Mira  gazing stood  And thus reply'd the seeming Wood  ' Canst thou behold me and not find  ' The Picture of the Giver's Mind  ' Behold the Lock and shining Key  ' That ne'er its Mistress shall betray  ' Not blemish'd with a Spot of Rust  ' And always faithful to its Trust  ' The rest may be to you consign'd  ' For in this narrow Space you'll find  ' No Emblem large enough to fit  ' Her Bounty Judgment and her Wit  ' But  Mira  since I have begun  ' The Thread of my Discourse shall run  ' Explaining how I am to you  ' A Monitor and Table too  ' My hollow Spaces you may fill  ' With all your Verses good and ill  ' One small one for your Wit may do  ' But then your Faults will take up two  ' And from the rest I pray exclude  ' One sacred Place for Gratitude  ' And what our Patron yours and mine  ' Shall to my trusty Care consign  ' For those lov'd Strangers I'll secure  ' The Closet with its tiny Door  ' And now I've prattl'd long my Dear  ' Yet you are list'ning still to hear  ' Expecting that I shou'd supply  ' At once Advice and Prophesy  ' But that's not right for me nor you  ' To dive so deeplytho' 'tis true  ' Without Divining I can see  ' You'll ne'er deserve the Gift of me  ' More wou'd you knowwhy may be then  ' Within these Mornings nine or ten  ' Propitious Jet may tsudge before  ' And lead his Mistress to your Door  ' And when the Sun whose distant Wheels  ' But faintly warm the icy Fields  ' Shall gild your Cot with brighter Ray  ' I hope to see her ev'ry Day  ' But turn away thy stedfast Eyes  ' That stare so ghastly with Surprise  ' Go seek your Pillow and be still  ' And dream of me or what you will  ' This said which  Mira  hop'd was true  ' The Lid shut up and cries Adieu"  Then gave a Crack and spoke no more  And all was silent as before  CELADON to MIRA  TO thee O  Mira  I these Lines commend  These from thy gentle and immortal Friend  Tho' not to thee my airy Form appears  Yet I've been oft a Witness to thy Tears  At Night when lonely by the Taper's Flame  In a still Whisper thou hast breath'd my Name  And in thy Eyes beheld the rising Woe  Ah simple Sorrows when for me they flow  Think not O  Mira  not in me to find  A Friend like  Vido  or like  Rosalind  Or like  Courtine  to cheat thy dazzl'a Eye  And sooth thy Weakness with a wellbred Lye  These are as thou wilt by the Sequel find  Below a Spirit of the blissful kind  And was thy Form as wanton  Helen  gay  Or did thy Eyes outshine the Lamp of Day  These please not meBright Eyes in vain may roll  I read no Charms but in the purer Soul  By thy chang'd Features I too often find  The wild Ideas of thy restless Mind  All serious now abstracted from the Crew  No prudent Stoick more serene than you  Till in your Brain some gaudy Pictures spring  All gay and careless then you laugh and sing  These vanish like a painted Cloudand now  Pale Discontent o'ershades thy mournful Brow  You form dark Visions and at Phantoms start  These Woes proceed from an illgovern'd Heart  From a too thoughtless or too roving Mind  For these are Strangers to a Soul resign'd  Canst thou presume thy little Bark may steer  From Griefs black Eddy and the Gulphs of Fear  Or canst thou hope to scape the gloomy Land  Where Disappointments crowd the rocky Strand  Not sonor let thy Vanity pretend  To hope for more than ever blest thy Friend  In Life I shone conspicuous o'er the rest  While the pure Beams malignant Eyes opprest  Sound Judgment Learning Wisdom too was mine  And piercing Wit superior far to thine  Yet gaping Rage stood ready to devour  And Dulness rain'd on me a leaden Shower  Now stung with Scoffs and now with Flatt'ry tir'd  Defam'd applauded envy'd and admir'd  This Fate was mineto hope canst thou presume  A milder Passage and more easy Doom  Deluded Girl let not a Thought so vain  Elate thy Spirits nor ascend thy Brain  But hear O  Mira  nor too late be wise  From painted Trifles turn thy longing Eyes  Ask not for what will make thy Pray'r offend  But ask Content a Parent and a Friend  Ask Bread and Peace 'tis all that Nature craves  This Kings acknowledge when they find their Graves  Say why thy Features lose their healthful Dye  And the Tears tremble in the languid Eye  The mighty Conflict I with pity see  When thy rude Passions struggle to be free  And rack thy Breastthe incoherent Stage  Where grave and comick jar like Youth and Age  Now Death appears all horrible and grim  But the next Moment none so fair as him  And now you sighAh let me calmly die  Then shrinking trembling from the Grave you fly  Such jarring Tumults in your Bosom roll  Ah what so various as a Woman's Soul  But thou beware and if thy Fate has join'd  A sickly Body to a roving Mind  Be calm nor mourn at the Supreme Decree  Nor think the Mandate shall be chang'd for thee  But meet with Patience what thou canst not flee  Wou'dst thou repine to see thy Form decay  When  Spio  's Eyelids are forbid the Day  Might'st thou with us unbodied Spirits fly  From Sphere to Sphere and trace the boundless Sky  Then wou'd the Lives of little Mortals shew  Like empty Bubbles rais'd of Morning Dew  All seem as Trifles whether we behold  A Monarch banish'd or a Sparrow sold  A thoughtless Insect trampled in the Mire  Or a proud Beauty in her Bloom expire  More noble Scenes enraptur'd Spirits view  But the grand Prospect is too large for you  A closer Bound best suits thy narrow Mind  A few Examples of thy fading kind  Hast thou forgot the soft  Iphenia  's Name  Whose smiling Face not Spleen itself could blame  Scarce nineteen Years her dawning Beauties knew  E'er the young Roses bid her Cheeks adieu  Yet bless'd with all cou'd please a Woman's Pride  In this gay Bloom the bright  Iphenia  dy'd  Her Sire lifts to Heav'n his mournful Eyes  And her sad Brother fills the Air with Cries  Her Brother  Clodius  who to Grief resign'd  To fruitless Passion all his manly Mind  What simple Sorrow to the dead you pay  Who soon must follow the same dusky Way  For e'er the Transport of his Grief was o'er  Fate gave the Sign and  Clodius  was no more  Still  Pero  liv'd a yet surviving Son  A little Space and  Pero  's Race was done  Death's icy Hand his youthful Limbs invades  And bids him mingle with his kindred Shades  So quickly  Pero  and  Narcissa  fell  Scarce looking round them e'er they bid farewel  Yet dang'rous 'tis to wander here too long  These went more willing as they fell more young  But  Laura  's Name demands thy flowing Tears  Whose Doubts increasing with her lengthen'd Years  Serv'd not to clear but cloud the dusky Way  And gave new Terrors to her final Day  The dreadful Moment wou'd have past as well  At sixteen Years had weeping  Laura  fell  Let this O  Mira  chear thy drooping Mind  To bear the Sentence past on all Mankind  I bore the same whose Life was more desir'd  More lov'd more known and justly more admir'd  Yet this grand Fear is wove with Nature's Laws  Is sometimes right and sometimes has no Cause  Repent and mendthese Vapours then will fly  And the Clouds brighten to a purer Sky  Still look to Heav'n and its Laws attend  And next the Lines of thy aerial Friend  On Mr POPE's Universal PRAYER  AH Thou whom Nature and thy Stars design'd  At once the Joy and Envy of Mankind  To thy lov'd Memory this Sigh I send  To thee a Stranger to thy Lines a Friend  How blest the Muse cou'd she like thine aspire  So smooth her Accent and sublime her Fire  With bright Description make the Bosom glow  Charm like thy Sense and like thy Numbers flow  O teach my Soul to reach the Seats divine  And praise her Maker in a Strain like thine  Ye careless Ones who never thought before  Read this grand Verse then tremble and adore  Let stern Enthusiasts here be taught to know  'Tis from the Heart true Piety must flow  Here Hope Content and smiling Mercy shine  And breathe celestial through the speaking Line  From the still Mind its guilty Passions roll  And dawning Grace awakes the fervent Soul  Let angry Zealots quarrel for a Name  The good the just the virtuous are the same  Grace to no Sect nor Virtue is confin'd  They blend with all and spread amongst the kind  And the pure Flame that warms the pious Breast  Those cannot merit who condemn the rest  To the dark Nations when Religion came  All drest in Smiles they saw the heav'nly Dame  Till some stern Teachers of their Office proud  Chose not to soften but affright the Crowd  With gloomy Terrors fill'd the dusky Age  And veil'd her Beauties in the mask of Rage  Then bid the Handmaids of Perdition rise  Black Cruelty with fierce and flaming Eyes  Distraction ravag'd on the publick Weal  And Persecution wore the Robe of Zeal  Deluded Faith espous'd the stronger Side  And conquer'd Justice gave her Sword to Pride  This saw the surly discontented Mind  By Nature haughty and to Vice inclin'd  And thence concluded all their Systems vain  The Cant of Schools and Phrensy of the Brain  From hence the Sect of Libertines arose  Who scorn what Reason or the Priests impose  Who give to Chance the World's that round us roll  And tear from Man his everconscious Soul  But thou whose Name immortal as thy Rhymes  Shall live and brighten through succeeding Times  Whose Lines can Wit and Virtue both inspire  Whom future Ages shall like me admire  Teach me between the two Extremes to glide  Not brave the Stream nor swim with ev'ry Tide  But more with Charity than Zeal possest  Keep my own Faith yet not condemn the rest  The FIELDS of MELANCHOLY and CHEARFULNESS  STILL were the Groves and venerable Night  O'er half the Globe had cast her gloomy Veil  When by a Taper's solitary Gleam  Sat musing  Mira  pensive and alone  In her sad Breast officious Memory  Reviv'd the Pictures of departed Friends  Whose pleasing Forms she must behold no more  Forgotten Woe that for a time had slept  Rose into Life and like a Torrent pour'd  On her faint Soul which sunk beneath its Rage  At length soft Slumber kindly interven'd  And clos'd those Eyelids that were drench'd in Tears  But restless Fancy that was waking still  Led my deluded Spirit on the Wing  To pictur'd Regions and imagin'd Worlds  I seem'd transported to a gloomy Land  Whose Fields had never known the chearful Sun  A heavy Mist hung in the frowning Sky  No feather'd Warblers chear'd the mourning Groves  Nor blushing Flow'rs adorn'd the barren Ground  I gaz'd around the solitary Coast  When lo a Nymph with solemn Air approach'd  Whose Dress was careless and her Features grave  Her Voice was broken and her Hearing dull  She spoke but seldom yet at last she told  Me in a Whisper that her Name was Thought  And more she offer'd with a friendly Air  To lead me safely through the dreary Gloom  We walk'd along through rough unpleasing Paths  O'er Beds of NightShade and through Groves of Yew  Till we arriv'd within a dusky Wood  Whose spacious Bound was fenc'd with shagged Thorn  The Trees were baleful Cypress and a few  Tall Pines that murmur'd to the rushing Wind  Here dwelt the Natives mournful as the Place  Or sunk in real or imagin'd Woe  Complaining Sounds were heard on ev'ry Side  And each bewail'd the loss of something dear  Some mourn'd a Child that in its Bloom expir'd  And some a Brother's or a Parent's Fate  Lost Wealth and Honours many Tongues deplor'd  And some were wretched tho' they knew not why  But as we reach'd the Centre of the Place  Complaints were heard more piercing than before  The gathering Fogs grew thicker o'er our Heads  And a cold Horror thrill'd our wounded Souls  And thus we travell'd pensive beyond measure  Through Paths half cover'd with perplexing Thorns  At length we found two Rows of aged Firs  Whose Tops were blasted by unwholsom Winds  This solitary  Vista  op'ning wide  Disclos'd the Palace of its mournful Queen  Before the Gate was plac'd a frightful Guard  Who serv'd as Porters to the gloomy Dome  Here stretch'd upon a miserable Couch  Lay pining Sickness with continual Groans  And by her Side array'd in filthy Weeds  Sat quaking Poverty with ghastly stare  His Presence seem'd to aggravate her Pain  For when she cast her languid Eyes on him  She hid her Face and rais'd a fearful Cry  There Disappointment like a Statue stood  With Eyes dejected and with Visage pale  Her heaving Bosom seem'd to swell with Anguish  And in her Hand she grasp'd a broken Reed  Here in the Garb of Piety we saw  Proud Error frowning with a Look severe  Doubt at his Elbow bore a Rod of Snakes  And held a Cup fill'd to the Brim with Tears  By these we pass'd into the dusky Court  O'errun with Hemlock and with gloomy Fern  Perpetual Night hung o'er the dismal Walls  And from the Ground unhealthy Vapours rose  Through folding Doors of Ebony we came  Into a winding Passage hung with black  For ever darkpossest by flitting Shades  By waking Fancies and by frightful Dreams  This led us to a subterraneous Cell  Where the sad Empress  Melancholy  reign'd  The musing Matron sat upon a Throne  Of mould'ring Earthher Footstool of the same  And for her Canopy an aged Yew  Spread o'er her Head its venerable Arms  Her careless Robe was of a sable Hue  And on her Shoulders flow'd her slighted Hair  Her Lips were clos'd with an eternal Silence  Her Arms were folded and her Head reclin'd  On either Side her pale Attendants stood  Two mournful Maids Dejection and Despair  The first attended with continual Faintings  Seem'd on the Point to close her dying Eyes  A constant Dew hung on her deathlike Brow  And her cold Bosom half forgot to heave  Despair whose Garments by herself were torn  Was mark'd with Wounds that Time can never heal  With desp'rate Hand she struck her bleeding Breast  And wash'd the Ground with neverceasing Tears  With ghastly Figures was the Cave adorn'd  And in the midst the Effigies of Death  Shock'd at the Place we hasted to return  And left the horrid Mansion far behind  Long time we travell'd through untrodden Paths  Where the brown Forests cast an awful Gloom  At length the floating Clouds began to part  And left behind them Streaks of chearful Azure  Our Path grew smooth and widen'd to the view  Until it open'd on a spacious Field  A Field whose Charms no Painter e'er cou'd reach  Though he shou'd borrow from the Poet's Heav'n  The Clime was temp'rate and the Air was still  The sprouting Turf was of a beauteous Green  Speckled with Flow'rs of a delicious Dye  Here crystal Lakes were border'd round with Trees  Where Blossoms flourish'd in eternal Spring  For here the Groves no blasting Tempests know  But still are blest with Fruits that ne'er decay  Perpetual Sunshine crown'd the gaudy Hills  And the fair Vallies were with Plenty gay  A Path there was trod o'er the spicy Field  Which led the Wand'rer to a blissful Shade  Whose Fence was made of balmy Eglantine  Where the fair Plane o'erlook'd the Myrtle Shrub  And flow'ring Orange that perfume the Air  Here flew in Throngs the soft aerial Choir  Whose glitt'ring Necks like polish'd Amber shone  We pass'd delighted through ambrosial Paths  And Bowers move with Jessamine and Rose  Joy seiz'd the ravish'd Spirits while we breath'd  In Gales that tasted of immortal Sweets  At length the parting Trees broke into Form  And with a Circle bound a charming Plain  I'th' midst of which upon an Iv'ry Throne  Sat Chearfulness the Genius of the Place  Her Mien was graceful and her Features fair  Continual Smiles dwelt on her dimpl'd Cheeks  Her Hair was bound beneath a shining Crown  Her Robes were Azure bright with golden Stars  And in her Hand she held a silver Lute  On either Side her royal Sisters sat  Both lovely as herself tho' not so gay  The eldest had a Face divinely fair  Calm was her Look with Lips prepar'd for smiling  She often rais'd her thankful Eyes to Heav'n  Her Form was easy and her Name  Content  The other much the youngest was array'd  In Virgin Robes white as unsully'd Snow  Her thoughtless Smiles wou'd tame a Tiger's Rage  A Lamb whose Neck was circl'd with a Band  Of new blown Roses at her Feet was laid  A milkwhite Dove upon her Hand she bore  Thus ever blest sat  Innocence  the fair  Behind these Sisters stood a shining Train  As Maids of Honour to the Royal Fair  Prosperity  the first was climbing up  A stately Pyramid of painted Marble  From whose high Top she reach'd a brilliant Crowd  Then with an Air that spoke a joyful Heart  Look'd down with Pleasure on the Plain below  Gay  Wealth  the next in her embroider'd Vest  Shone like the Entrails of the eastern Mine  Her Hair was platted thick with sparkling Gems  And in her Hand she bore a golden Wand  Health  like a Sylvan Huntress cloath'd in Green  In her right Hand a dapled Palfry held  Her Air was masculine and swift her Motion  A Wreath of Flow'rs just ravish'd from the Meads  Bound up the Ringlets of her sable Hair  Her Cheeks were ruddy and her large black Eyes  Confess'd the Vigour of her sprightly Soul  These were the Natives of this happy Land  The Sight of whom so fill'd my glowing Breast  With Ecstasy that I awoke And thus  Their Glories vanish'd and were seen no more  The LIBYAN HUNTER a FABLE  Inscrib'd to the Memory of a late admir'd Author  WHEN Merit rises like the Prince of Day  Pale Envy turns her aking Eyes away  Then sallow Cheeks with Rage are taught to glow  And narrow Souls to bloated Furies grow  Old Story tells us on an earthly Plain  Once  Jove  descended wrap'd in golden Rain  Now Fate permits no such familiar Powers  But Shoals of Criticks fall in leaden Showers  These gaze at Wit as Owls behold the Sun  And curse the Lustre which they fain wou'd shun  These Beasts of Prey no living worth endure  Nor are the Regions of the Dead secure  Yet shall the Worthy o'er their Spite prevail  Here lies the Moralfollows next the Tale  Once on a time on  Libya  's thirsty Land  Where Showers seldom wet the burning Sand  Liv'd happy  Sylvius  as the Morning gay  A wellknown Fav'rite of the Prince of Day  Whose Hand unerring to the Mark in view  Sent the swift Arrow from the twanging Yew  The trembling Panthers from his Fury fly  When the keen Jav'lin hiss'd along the Sky  Fierce were his Eyes and dazzling as the Sun  His raven Looks in mazy Ringlets run  A wellstor'd Quiver at his Back was ty'd  A shining Spear his better Hand supply'd  Thus rudely charming he was sure to please  With graceful Negligence and careless Ease  He breath'd soft Musick from his tuneful Tongue  And the wild Tiger listen'd to his Song  The woodland Nymphs their dusky Shades forego  And the blue  Naiads  left the Deeps below  None guard the Flocks nor hunt the flying Prey  Till he had finish'd the enchanting Lay  Then Sylvan Dames with Wreaths of Laurel bound  His chearful Temples and with Roses crown'd  But grudging Envy heard the just Applause  And the pale Phantom writh'd her hagard Jaws  Now swell'd the Bosoms of repining Swains  And hissing Scandals flew across the Plains  At length his Fame the wondring Sky invades  And reach'd the Muses in their sacred Shades  Bright  Thalia  view'd him with an envious Eye  And thus address'd her Partners of the Sky  ' Ye tuneful Maids give o'er the labour'd Song  ' Small are the Praises to our share belong  ' Look down and see on yonder sultry Plain  ' Our Voices equal'd by a  Libyan  Swain  ' Give o'er the Lay ye too officious Fair  ' Lay down the Lyre and fruitless Hymns forbear  ' Nor hope to charm the partial Prince of Day  ' While heav'nly Accents breathe from mortal Clay  ' In vain we keep our radiant Seats on high  ' If rural Swains shall with our Musick vie'  She said And Rage possest the beauteous Ring  Some curse the Youth and some their partial King  The Dame who saw th' infectious Murmurs run  Roll'd her blue Eyes and thus afresh begun  ' No more the Bays shall to our Share belong  ' Nor charm'd Celestials shall attend our Song  ' But all to  Sylvius  shall their Off'rings pay  ' To  Sylvius  favour'd by the Prince of Day  ' Shall he exceed the Muses sacred Choir  ' Not while Revenge shall injur'd Bosoms fire  ' But see my Sisters On the Plains below  ' Swift  Cynthia  's Hounds pursue the flying Doe  ' Be mine the Task to bear a fraudful Tale  ' To the swift Hunters in the  Libyan  Vale  ' As how her Herds in vain from  Sylvius  fly  ' His Darts pursue them and the Victims die  ' So  Delia  's Rage shall stop his tuneful Tongue  ' And we no more shall dread the rival Song  Here ceas'd the Damethe smiling Sisters join  Their loud Applauses to her sly Design  Now had the Sun withdrawn his piercing Eye  And Night assum'd the Empire of the Sky  Lull'd in her Lap reposing Nature lay  And Swains forgot the Labours of the Day  The Winds were hush'd the Ocean ceas'd to roar  And softly murmur'd by the sandy Shore  When from  Parnassus  flew the envious Maid  To seek the Huntress of the lonely Shade  The fierce  Virago  on a verdant Plain  She found encircl'd by her sleeping Train  Where a cool River blest the fertile Ground  Its Bank with Trees and bending Ofier's crown'd  Beneath a Shade the lovely  Dian  stood  With downcast Eyes and view'd the rolling Flood  Whose Waves were bright with the reflected Beams  Of her own Orb that sparkl'd on the Streams  ' Hail  Delia  Hail began the artful Dame  ' Lives there a Wretch who owns not  Delia  's Name  ' Lives there a Slave whose daring Hand defies  ' The awful Empress of the nightly Skies  ' Yes haughty  Sylvius  triumphs o'er the Plain  ' Tho' thy choice Herds are by his Arrows slain  ' The frighted Fauns his wanton Rage wou'd fly  ' But the keen Dart o'ertakes 'em and they die  ' His shining Spear arrests the trembling Doe  ' And groaning Stags the deadly Weapon know  ' But if fair  Delia  to the  Libyan  Swain  ' Resigns the Freedom of her sacred Plain  ' Let none dispute the Licence of her Will  ' And I retire to our tuneful Hill'  With flushing Features and disorder'd Charms  The angry Goddess seiz'd her deathful Arms  ' Shall Man with me dispute the Plain she cries  While kindling Rage inflam'd her rolling Eyes  ' This Hand shall well revenge my slaughter'd Deer  She said And furious grasp'd the dreadful Spear  And o'er her Shoulder flung the shining Bow  Then breathing Vengeance sought her guiltless Foe  The Youth beneath a dusky Shade she found  Thoughtless of Ill and sleeping on the Ground  A deadly Shaft deluded  Cynthia  drew  And to his Heart the feather'd Vengeance flew  The reaking Blood came bubbling through the Wound  Pour'd o'er his Bosom and distain'd the Ground  Then the freed Spirit took her airy Way  To Fields of Pleasure and of endless Day  The redcheek'd Morning had now chas'd away  Night's sable Curtainand the dawning Day  Call'd forth abroad the trusty BandsAgain  To chase the Tiger o'er the Desert Plain  To search the Caves where kingly Lions roar  And from thick Shades dislodge the bristled Boar  Sylvius  they want for him they search they call  They search the Shades where crystal Waters fall  His wonted Haunts Then ev'ry Voice they try  In vain they call for none alas reply  Hear  Sylvius  hear they cry and all around  Hear  Sylvius  hear the hollow Rocks resound  At length a Crew the basest of the Plain  Approach'd the Covert of the slaughter'd Swain  Glad they beheld him breathless on the Ground  And gaz'd with Rapture on the purple Wound  When one beganNow bless the friendly Hand  That swept off  Sylvius  from the gazing Land  Behold the Day so oft by us desir'd  Here lies the Swain whom lately all admir'd  This  Phoebus  saw as from his blazing Wheels  With his broad Eye he view'd the glitt'ring Fields  Behold the Youth whom he had taught to throw  The feather'd Arrow from the bounding Bow  Beheld his  Sylvius  to whose artful Tongue  He taught the Numbers of enchanting Song  Now cold and breathless on the dewy Plain  And his worst Foes insulting o'er the Slain  Then rag'd the God that wears the silver Bow  And his broad Eyes with sparkling Fury glow  Descended  Phoebus  in a burning Ray  His beamy Locks declares the Prince of Day  And flashing Glories round his Temples play  Each on his Face the trembling Victims fall  Their stammering Tongues wou'd fain for Mercy call  But as all grov'ling on the Dust they lie  His Shafts dispatch them to the darker Sky  Learn hence he cry'd ye impious Men to know  And dread the Pow'r that wears the mortal Bow  For while I rule the blazing Throne of Day  None wrong my Servants but shall find their Pay  He saidand rais'd his Fav'rite from the Ground  Then smil'd the Features And the gaping Wound  Was seen no more The glowing Cheeks revive  Shake off the Stamp of Death and seem alive  Instead of Cypress and a mournful Shroud  Apollo  wrap'd him in a golden Cloud  And bore him thence But where there's none can say  Unless to his own Regions of the Day  And from the Ground where  Sylvius  late was seen  Where the warm Gore had stain'd the thirsty Green  A pleasing Tree arose with slender Stems  That breath'd  Ambrosia  from its op'ning Gems  Those op'ning Gems the Virgins us'd to wear  On their fair Bosoms and their shining Hair  Now the gay Shrub each happy Climate knows  By all admir'd and 'tis call'd the Rose  The TEMPLE of LOVE  WHEN lonely Night compos'd the drowsy Mind  And hush'd the Bosom of the weary Hind  Pleas'd with plain Nature and with simple Life  I read the Scenes of  Shore  's deluded Wife  Till my faint Spirits sought the silent Bed  And on its Pillow drop'd my aking Head  Then Fancy ever to her  Mira  kind  Prepar'd her Phantoms for the roving Mind  Behold a Fabrick rising from the Ground  To the soft Timbrel and the Cittern's Sound  Corinthian  Pillars the vast Building hold  Of polish'd Silver and  Peruvian  Gold  In four broad Arches spread the shining Doors  The blazing Roofs enlighten all the Floors  Beneath a sparkling Canopy that shone  With  Persian  Jewels like a Morning Sun  Wrap'd in a Robe of purest  Tyrian  Dye  Cythera  's Image met the ravish'd Eye  Whose glowing Features wou'd in Paint beguile  So well the Artist drew her mimick Smile  Her shining Eyes confess'd a sprightly Joy  Upon her Knees reclin'd her wanton Boy  On the bright Walls around her and above  Were drawn the Statutes and the Arts of Love  These taught the silent Language of the Eye  The broken Whisper and amusing Lye  The careless Glance peculiar to the Fair  And Vows for Lovers that dissolve in Air  The graceful Anger and the rolling Eyes  The practis'd Blush and counterfeit Surprise  The Language proper for pretending Swains  And fine Description for imagin'd Pains  The friendly Caution and designing Ease  And all the Arts that ruin while they please  Now entred follow'd by a splendid Train  A blooming Damsel and a wealthy Swain  The gaudy Youth in shining Robes array'd  Behind him follow'd the unthinking Maid  Youth in her Cheek like op'ning Roses sprung  Her careless Tresses on her Shoulders hung  Her Smiles were chearful as enliv'ning  May  Her Dress was careless and her Eyes were gay  Then to soft Voices and melodious Sound  The Board was spread the sparkling Glasses crown'd  The sprightly Virgin in a Moment shines  In the gay Entrails of the eastern Mines  Then Pride comes in with Patches for the Fair  And spicy Odours for her curling Hair  Rude Riot in a crimson Vest array'd  With smoothfac'd Flatt'ry like a Chambermaid  Soft Pomp and Pleasure at her Elbow stand  And Folly shakes the Rattles in her Hand  But now her feeble Structure seem'd to shake  Its Basis trembl'd and its Pillars quake  Then rush'd Suspicion through the lofty Gate  With heartsick Loathing led by ghastly Hate  And foaming Rage to close the horrid Band  With a drawn Poniard in her shaking Hand  Now like an Earthquake shook the reeling Frame  The Lamps extinguish in a purple Flame  One universal Groan was heard and then  The Cries of Women and the Voice of Men  Some roar out Vengeance some for Mercy call  And Shrieks and Tumult fill the dreadful Hall  At length the Spectres vanish'd from my Sight  Again the Lamps resum'd a feeble Light  But chang'd the Place No Splendor there was shown  But gloomy Walls that Mirth had never known  For the gay Dome where Pleasure us'd to dwell  Appear'd an Abbey and a doleful Cell  And here the sad the ruin'd Nymph was found  Her Robe disorder'd and her Locks unbound  While from her Eyes the pearly Drops of Woe  Wash'd her pale Cheek where Roses us'd to blow  Her blue and trembling Lips prepar'd to breathe  The Sighs that made her swelling Bosom heave  Thus stupid with her Grief she sat and prest  Her lily Hands across her pensive Breast  A Group of ghastly Phantoms stood behind  Whose Task it is to wreck the guilty Mind  Widemouth'd Reproach with Visage rude and thin  And hissing Scandal made a hideous Din  Remorse that darted from her deadly Wings  Invenom'd Arrows and a thousand Stings  Then with pale Cheeks and with a ghastly Stare  Peep'd o'er her Shoulder hollowey'd Despair  Whose Hand extended bore a bleeding Heart  And Death behind her shook his threat'ning Dart  These Forms with Horror fill'd my aking Breast  And from my Eyelids drove the Balm of Rest  I woke and found old Night her Course had run  And left her Empire to the rising Sun  ADVICE to MYRTILLO  SINCE you  Myrtillo  will devote your Time  To the lean Study of delusive Rhyme  Since

lies before your Way  Yet Friend be careful 'tis a dang'rous Sea  Where tho' some few may reach the happy Land  Numbers are wreck'd upon the treach'rous Sand  Then guard your Spirits as you prize your Ease  Nor once indulge 'em in a thirst of Praise  For Fame like Fortune proud yet wanton too  Is pleas'd to fly and make the Wretch pursue  Frowns on her Slaves but to the careless Mind  That slights

Current down his Chin  From soft Tobacco lodg'd within  Be pleas'd to steal a Glance or two  But one may serve to make you  He fain wou'd walk but cannot stand  And see a Palsy in his Hand  And tho' his Throat has swallow'd down  Two Gallons of October brown  His greedy Guts impatient roar  And seem to call aloud for more  More they shall have But hark within  Is heard a rude and lawless Din  Wind Ale and Phlegm their Powers wage  And Hickups call them to engage  And now Ah now incessant flows  The frothy Tide from Mouth and Nose  No more is seen the cover'd Ground  But a huge River floating round  Down drops the Youth his giddy Head  Falls easy on the liquid Bed  So swam  Achilles  fierce and brave  On angry  Xanthus  's swelling Wave  And 'scap'd with being wet to th' Skin  For  Pallas  held him up by th' Chin  So  Bacchus  saves by mighty Charms  His helpless Devotee from Harms  And  Soto  sleeps till break of Day  Then shakes his Ears and walks away  The UNIVERSAL DREAM  ' GIVE o'er your Whims says my considerate Friend  ' Retrieve the fleeting Hours you idly spend  ' Blind to Advice incorrigible vain  ' You follow Fancy and her laughing Train  ' Your thoughtless Days in swift Delusion fly'  So let them go says unconverted I  Look round the Globe my Friend and then you'll see  The drowsy World is slumb'ring just like me  See on soft Beds the Hero sleeps secure  Till War comes thund'ring at his trembling Door  In wiser Dreams the Politician prys  Through distant Kingdoms with his halfshut Eyes  The lull'd Projector builds aerial Towers  And rolls smooth Rivers through enchanted Bowers  The Chymist slumbers o'er imagin'd Gold  So  Delia  's Conquests in her Dreams are told  What monstrous Phantoms in that Trance are born  Through which  Amyntor  sees his sprouting Horn  When purblind Mortals sound the Depths of Fate  Or some lean Poet aims at an Estate  Or when the good believing Man depends  On the slight Promise of his courtly Friends  Shou'd those awake they to their Cost wou'd find  These are but Shadows of a sleeping Mind  Few real Pleasures are on Earth possest  And Mortals only in their Dreams are blest  Then dream no longer my wellmeaning Friend  That  Mira  's Follies with her Muse shall end  Some younger Vanity succeeds the first  And the last Folly often proves the worst  No While the rest in fruitless Cares are hurl'd  Let me enjoy my visionary World  To this glad Bosom hug the dear Mistake  If Dreams are Blessings who wou'd wish to wake  The SOW and the PEACOCK  A FABLE  IN Days of Yore as Authors tell  When Beasts and Birds cou'd read and spell  No matter where in Town or City  There liv'd a Swine exceeding witty  And for the Beauties of her Mind  Excelling all her bristl'd Kind  But yet to mortify her Pride  She found at last her failing Side  Philosophy she had good Store  Had ponder'd  Seneca  all o'er  Yet all Precautions useless prove  Against the Pow'r of mighty Love  It happen'd on a sultry Day  Upon her fav'rite Couch she lay  'Twas a round Dunghil soft and warm  O'ershadow'd by a neighb'ring Barn  When lo her winking Eyes behold  A Creature with a Neck of Gold  With painted Wings and gorgeous Train  That sparkl'd like the starry Plain  His Neck and Breast all brilliant shine  Against the Sun The dazzl'd Swine  Who never saw the like before  Began to wonder and adore  But seeing him so fair and nice  She left her Dunghil in a trice  And fond to please the grunting Elf  Began to wash and prune herself  And from the stinking Wave she run  To dry her Carcase in the Sun  Then rubb'd her Sides against a Tree  And now as clean as Hogs can be  With cautious Air and doubtful Breast  The glitt'ring  Peacock  thus addrest  ' Sir I a homely rural Swine  ' Can boast of nothing fair nor fine  ' No Dainties in our Troughts appear  ' But as you seem a Stranger here  ' Be pleas'd to walk into my Sty  ' A little Hut as plain as I  ' Pray venture through the humble Door  ' And tho' your Entertainment's poor  ' With me you shall be sure to find  ' An open Heart and honest Mind  ' And that's a Dainty seldom found  ' On Cedar Flow'rs and City Ground  Thus far the Sow had preach'd by rule  She preach'd alas but to a Fool  For this same Peacock you must know  Had he been Man had been a Beau  And had like them but mighty little  To say So squirted out his Spittle  And with an Air that testified  He'd got at least his share of Pride  He thus began 'Why truly now  ' You're very civil Mrs  Sow  ' But I am very clean d'ye see  ' Your Sty is not a Place for me  ' Shou'd I go through that narrow Door  ' My Feathers might be soil'd or tore  ' Or scented with unsav'ry Fumes  ' And what am I without my Plumes  The much offended Sow replies  And turns asquint her narrow Eyes  ' Sir you're incorrigibly vain  ' To value thus a shining Train  ' For when the northern Wind shall blow  ' And send us Hail and Sleet and Snow  ' How will you save from such keen Weathers  ' Your MeritSir I mean your Feathers  ' As for myselfto think that I  ' Shou'd lead an Idiot to my Sty  ' Or strive to make an Oaf my Friend  ' It makes my Bristles stand an end  ' But for the future when I see  ' A Bird that much resembles thee  ' I'll ever take it as a Rule  ' The shining Case contains a Fool  FLORIMELIA the First PASTORAL  By Mr NEWTON  OF  Florimelia  and her Charms I sing  Fair as the Blossoms of the smiling Spring  Whose lovely Temples wore a Myrtle Wreath  That serv'd to shade her glowing Cheeks beneath  How wou'd that Brow which never knew to frown  Become the Splendor of an awful Crown  For by the lustre of her shining Eyes  You'd take her for an Empress in disguise  Those graceful Limbs tho' clad in humble Green  Wou'd suit a Princess nor disgrace a Queen  Yet a plain Crook adorn'd her snowy  Hands  Fair as the Fleeces of her tender  Lambs  Her Task it was those tender Lambs to lead  O'er the tall Mountain on the fertile Mead  Where the clear Fountains gently murmur by  And sounding Grottos to her Flute reply  Her Flute and Song delude the tedious Day  And her soft Hours calmly glide away  In Smiles the Fair One view'd the rising Sun  In Smiles beheld him when his Race was done  And when his Beams had bid the Fields adieu  And the damp Meadows shone with pearly Dew  Pent in their Fold she leaves her wanton Care  And to her home returns the happy Fair  'Twas a low Cottage humble as their Fate  Where an old Father met her at the Gate  This Hind was call'd  Asophus  of the Plain  A Name much valu'd by each honest Swain  On whose grave Brow were seen the Marks of Time  No more his Cheeks confess'd their healthy Prime  Dim were his Eyes Those Eyeballs that had seen  Full fourscore Springs array'd in sprightly Green  Child of his Age was  Florimel  the Fair  And she alone his Comfort and his Care  Their little House was plac'd beneath a Hill  Whose Verge was water'd by a streaming Rill  The Stranger here no gilded Spires saw  For this low Roof was thatch'd with humble Straw  Mosaick here nor Fretwork there was none  Nor  Venice  Glass to sparkle in the Sun  Its only Window was of Osier made  Full South it look'd and seldom knew the Shade  Where by the Sun this careful Peasant knew  How o'er his Head the swiftwing'd Minutes flew  A little Orchard too was planted nigh  And the cool River roll'd its Waters by  In whose clear Stream the pendent Willows lave  And the weak Bullrush trembl'd o'er the Wave  Within the Banks soft Watercresses spring  Where the pleas'd Heron prunes her dabbled Wing  Thus dwelt  Asophus  happier far than he  Whose Slaves approach him with a bending Knee  His willing Eyelids in soft Slumbers close  No midnight Revels break his lov'd Repose  No dark Intrigue for open Vengeance calls  Nor Envy dwelt within his peaceful Walls  But his calm Days in one smooth Circle run  He blest the rising and declining Sun  A Stranger both to Sickness and to Sin  'Twas Health without and Happiness within  While by his Side his  Florimelia  sung  And his fond Soul upon her Musick hung  Like him no Parent lov'd his darling Care  No Child like her so duteous and so fair  Him with crumb'd Milk both Morn and Eve she fed  And smooth'd the Pillows for his weary Head  With her his Moments gently glide away  Who dress'd in Smiles the Ev'ning and the Day  Hear this ye great Ones whose unwieldy Store  Is still embitter'd with a Wish for more  Who strive to climb on Fortune's slipp'ry Hill  And swallow Ruin in a golden Pill  But learn from hence that Happiness can dwell  With a plain Peasant in his humble Cell  She loves the Village and the harmless Hind  With a clear Conscience and a chearful Mind  And the gay Wantons vainly search around  For Bliss which only is with Virtue found  FLORIMELIA the Second PASTORAL  By Mr NEWTON  AS  Florimelia  watch'd her snowy Fold  Soft  Florimelia  with her Locks of Gold  Low in a Vale beneath a spreading Shade  Two ruddy Youths that lov'd the beauteous Maid  To please the Fair thus form'd the rival Song  While the Herds listen'd to each tuneful Tongue  PHILASTER  This Morn I wander'd through a poplar Grove  Where a lone Turtle mourn'd her absent Love  With pensive Coo she well express'd her Woe  Lull'd by her Voice the Brooks more gently flow  When lo the Partner of her Nest drew nigh  With hov'ring Wings And bid her Sorrows fly  All sprightly now with brisker Note she sings  Prunes her soft Breast and spreads her joyful Wings  No more the Grove is Witness to her Woe  Such are the Joys that faithful Lovers know  CHROMIS  As yester'even while my Sheep did feed  On a soft Bank I tun'd my Oaten Reed  'Twas there a single Violet I spy'd  That breath'd its Odours droop'd its Head and dy'd  When from the Root a gay Companion grew  Fair as the first and fresh as Morning Dew  Whose fragrant Leaves perfum'd the bord'ring Plain  Then did the first its former Beauties gain  Pleas'd with each other side by side they grow  Such are the Joys that faithful Lovers know  PHILASTER  As sweet as was the Violet is my Love  CHROMIS  And I as constant as the TurtleDove  PHILASTER  Soft are the Murmurs of a southern Wind  And the Complainings of a lovesick Mind  Soft are the Breathings of an Infant's Sleep  But she is softer than her harmless Sheep  CHROMIS  Sweet are the Gales that meet the rosy Morn  Sweet are the Flow'rs that yonder Meads adorn  Sweet are the Banks on which my Lambkins play  But my lov'd Nymph is sweet as early Day  PHILASTER  Where walks my Lovethere op'ning Roses bloom  And yellow Cowslips shed a choice Perfume  When she is gone the op'ning Roses fade  The Sun himself laments the absent Maid  CHROMIS  When smiles my Love then smile the Groves below  And the clear Skies with brighter Lustre glow  But when she frowns those Groves are glad no more  And the Sky lowers that was bright before  PHILASTER  While we prefer the Spring to Winter Storms  Or goodly Cedars to unseemly Thorns  While Maples keep below the lofty Pine  Shall my lov'd Nymph before her Sisters shine  CHROMIS  As we prefer the Peacock to the Crow  As Maidens fairer than their Mothers show  And as my Voice above  Philaster  swells  So my lov'd Nymph each other Nymph excels  PHILASTER  You sung last Night with more melodious Air  As you lay plaiting  Cloe  's yellow Hair  While the shrill Pipe her slender Fingers ply'd  The Pipe you gave her and your Heart beside  CHROMIS  'Twas you I saw beneath a maple Shade  With blubber'd Cheeks you curs'd the cruel Maid  Who broke your Cypress Bowl on yonder Plain  And sent the Willow to her slighted Swain  PHILASTER  'Tell me at midnight where do Mandrakes groan  And Blood fall dropping from the darkned Moon  Tell this and I shall for thy Learning yield  A coalblack Lamb that sports in yonder Field  CHROMIS  Tell me where Oaks have tender Medlars bore  And Shrubs yield Apples that were Crabs before  And for thy Knowledge I shall not refuse  To give the best of all my speckled Ewes  Thus sung the Shepherds while the list'ning Maid  Prais'd both their Songs and thus their Songs repaid  Behold this lovely Pineapple she cry'd  And this Twinchesnut once my chiefest Pride  These long were mine and these I give to you  To both a Prize a Prize to both is due  Now nightly Vapours taint the colder Air  They part the Flocks and to the Folds repair  And the black Clouds forbid their longer Stay  Their Feet unwilling tread their destin'd Way  At once Farewel too lovely Nymphs they cry  And on the Virgin cast a parting Eye  CATHARINA's CAVE  By Mr NEWTON  BENEATH a Mountain's solitary Shade  Liv'd  Catharina  then an ancient Maid  An useful Dame that ev'ry Simple knew  And from choice Herbs exhal'd a cordial Dew  Rude was her Dome and hid from prying Eyes  By lofty Hills that seem'd to reach the Skies  Deep in a Rock the winding Cavern run  A bending Cypress skreen'd it from the Sun  From its rude Side a Fountain us'd to flow  That pour'd incessant on the Stones below  This Musick lull'd the pensive Dame to Rest  And drew soft Slumbers on her aching Breast  No Sun was there nor scarce a dawning Gleam  No twinkling Stars nor  Cynthia  's silver Beam  There naked Elms and sapless Oaks appear'd  With Age grown rotten and by Light'ning sear'd  There perch'd the Raven and the grayey'd Owl  With his wise Visage and his serious Scowl  No Flow'rets there bedeck the mossy Ground  But a thick Forest spread its Shade around  Where the smooth Box and browner Hasel grew  The solemn Pinetree and the baleful Yew  Here no glad Sound was heard nor human Tongue  Not  Colin  's Flute nor  Blouzelinda  's Song  These gloomy Shades for Grief were only made  And howling Wolves that scamper'd thro' the Glade  Here  Catharina  spent her irksom Days  Secluded both from Envy and from Praise  Not so her laughing Moments us'd to run  When her bright Eyes were like a Morning Sun  When to her Flock repair'd the gazing Swains  Her Flock was then the fairest of the Plains  And she no lesswith Veins of sprightly Blue  And Cheeks like Roses wrap'd in Morning Dew  The Loves and Graces round her Features flew  Her Mind was chearful as the rising Day  Mature as Summer and as  April  gay  Yet Fate too soon eclips'd her early Joy  She fell the Victim of the winged Boy  The winged Boy that bears the fatal Darts  Henceforth may Virgins better guard their Hearts  'Twas  Celadon  'twas he that caus'd her Pain  The fairest Shepherd of the rural Train  Whose careless Beauty made her Heart his Prize  And stole the Slumbers from her wakeful Eyes  Long time her Pride and cooler Reason strove  Against the Power of encroaching Love  In vainher Cheeks and mournful Eyes declare  The smother'd Passion and the secret Care  While the dull Youth whom Beauty ne'er cou'd please  Who sought no more than Indolence and Ease  Rang'd o'er the Vallies with his darling Tray  Or near some Fountain slumber'd out the Day  All Nymphs he strove but mostly her to shun  And to thick Shades and distant Pastures run  There the soft Flute his nimble Fingers ply'd  While his lov'd Dog sat list'ning by his Side  Then wept the Fair with Grief and Rage oppress'd  Strange Passions labour'd in her pensive Breast  She lost her Crookher Flocks no more were told  And her Lambs wander'd from their nightly Fold  Till to these Shades she took her desp'rate Way  And vow'd no more to see the Beams of Day  Here the gay Roses on her Cheek expir'd  And from her Eyes the laughing Loves retir'd  No flow'ry Wreaths her faded Temples knew  Her Locks uncomb'd upon her Shoulders flew  No silken Vestments on her Limbs were roll'd  A russet Mantle sav'd her from the Cold  A simple Cordage round her Waste she ty'd  And a rude Staff her better Hand supply'd  Here learn'd the Dame the Physick of the Field  And what the Woods and what the Mountains yield  Of sov'reign Balm to heal a rankling Wound  Or ripen Swellings where no Sores are found  To strengthen Sinews and Catarrhs expel  And none for Colicks cou'd her Art excel  With magick Herbs she drew out fest'ring Thorns  Her Charms cou'd banish Toothach Cramps and Corns  To her repair'd from all the neighb'ring Plains  The sickly Matrons and the wounded Swains  Nor to one Species was her Art confin'd  Her Skill was known amongst the fleecy Kind  Her Cordials strengthen'd the declining Ewe  And limping Calves her healing Plaisters knew  The ENQUIRY  IN vain alas do lazy Mortals cry  In vain wou'd Wisdom trace the boundless Sky  Where doubled Wonders upon Wonders rise  And Worlds on Worlds confound our dazzl'd Eyes  Better be stillLet Nature rest say they  Than err by Guess and with Opinion stray  Then tell me why our Eyes were made to view  Those Orbs that glister in the fluid Blue  Why in our Sight those shining Wonders roll  Or why to Man was giv'n a thinking Soul  May I not ask how moves the radiant Sun  How the bright Stars their pointed Circuits run  What warms those Worlds that so remotely shine  And what can temper  Saturn  's frozen Clime  Who that beholds the fullorb'd Moon arise  That chearful Empress of the nightly Skies  Who wou'd not ask cou'd learned Sages tell  What kind of People on her Surface dwell  But there we pauseNot  Newton  's Art can show  A Truth perhaps not fit for us to know  How great the Pow'r who gave those Worlds to roll  The Thought strikes inward and confounds the Soul  Fall down O ManAh fall before the Rod  Of this Almighty Allcreating God  But harkfrom Heav'n there came a chearing Sound  Now Man revives and smile the Worlds around  'Tis Mercylo a golden Ray descends  And Hope and Comfort in the Lustre blends  When from the Stars we turn our aking Eyes  To Earth we bend them where new Wonders rise  Where Life and Death the equal Scale suspend  New Beings rising as the former end  Who not surpris'd can trace each just Degree  From the swift Eagle to the peevish Bee  From the fierce Lion that will yield to none  To the weak Mouse that hides her from the Sun  How near one Species to the next is join'd  The due Gradations please a thinking Mind  And there are Creatures which no Eye can see  That for a Moment live and breathe like me  Whom a small Fly in bulk as far exceeds  As you tall Cedar does the waving Reeds  These we can reachand may we not suppose  There still are Creatures more minute than those  Wou'd Heav'n permit and might our Organs bear  To pierce where Comets wave their blazing Hair  Where other Suns alternate set and rise  And other Moons light up the chearful Skies  The ravish'd Soul might still her Search pursue  Still find new Wonders op'ning on her view  From thence to Worlds in Miniature descend  And still press forward but shou'd find no End  Where little Forests on a Leaf appear  And Drops of Dew are mighty Oceans there  These may have Whales that in their Waters play  And wanton out their Age of half a Day  In those small Groves the smaller Birds may sing  And share like us their Winter and their Spring  Pluck off you Acorn from its Parent Bough  Divide that Acorn in the midstand now  In its firm Kernel a fair Oak is seen  With spreading Branches of a sprightly Green  From this young Tree a Kernel might we rend  There wou'd another its small Boughs extend  All Matter lives and shews its Maker's Power  There's not a Seed but what contains a Flower  Tho' unobserv'd its secret Beauty lies  Till we are blest with Microscopick Eyes  When for blue Plumbs our longing Palate calls  Or scarlet Cherries that adorn the Walls  With each plump Fruit we swallow down a Tree  And so destroy whole Groves that else wou'd be  As large and perfect as those Shades we see  Behold you Monster that unwieldly laves  Beneath the Surface of the briny Waves  Still as he turns the troubl'd Sea divides  And rolls in Eddies from his slimy Sides  Less huge the Dolphin to the Sun displays  His Scales and in the smoother Ocean plays  Still less the Herring and round Mackrel sweep  The shallow Tide nor trust the roaring Deep  How far by gradual numberless Degrees  The senseless Oyster is remov'd from these  Who follows Nature through her mazy Way  From the mute Insect to the Fount of Day  Where now she rises now her Steps decline  Has need of Judgment better taught than mine  But on this Subject we have talk'd too long  Where gravefac'd Wisdom may itself be wrong  The RIVAL BROTHERS  CELIA and I to share the vernal Gales  One Ev'ning wander'd o'er the dewy Vales  Still was the Soul and ev'ry Sense was pleas'd  And the cool Heart from Care and Business eas'd  Arm lock'd in Arm with heedless Steps we rove  Round the fair Borders of a blooming Grove  Reclin'd at ease within the secret Shades  A lovely Bower held two fairer Maids  Soft  Flavia  one with Cheeks of rosy Dye  And  Sylvia  famous for her starlike Eye  Sylvia  whose Wit was vers'd in charming Wiles  Who often varied her Discourse with Smiles  Lovetales she told some fictious and some true  The Subject various and her Stories new  Of Innocence oppress'd by mightier Wrong  And many Proofs she drew from sacred Song  When  Flavia  thusbehold the ling'ring Day  Still paints you Heavens with a silver Gray  And slothful Night with gentler Pace comes on  As if she listen'd to thy charming Tongue  The  Rival Brothers  let my  Sylvia  tell  How cross they lov'd and who untimely fell  Her Friend reply'd You shall not ask in vain  Although the Story gives thy  Sylvia  Pain  Then on her Cheek her iv'ry Hand she laid  And with a Sigh began the lovely Maid  Long time before our Fathers Lives began  There liv'd an ancient and a worthy Man  Was long the Fav'rite of indulgent Fame  For Wretches knew and bless'd  Clytiphon  's Name  Just without Pride without Reluctance kind  For inborn Goodness with soft Pity join'd  To form the Basis of his godlike Mind  His temp'rate Soul was ne'er disturb'd with Rage  But graceful bore the rev'rend Weight of Age  All bounteous Heav'n had to his share consign'd  A moderate Fortune with a peaceful Mind  His Dwelling seated on a rising Hill  Was water'd round with many a crystal Rill  Gardens and Groves the smother'd Buildings screen  Which look'd the Seat of some retir'd Queen  Cythania  tost of the admiring Land  The fairest Virgin of the shining Band  Did to  Clytiphon  's Honour trust her Charms  And gave her Beauties to his faithful Arms  But cruel Death whose Business is to rend  The paleey'd Matron from her weeping Friend  Had torn  Cythania  from his widow'd Side  And left her Spouse to wail his constant Bride  Heav'n spar'd one Child to crown his feeble Age  To chear his Spirits and his Grief asswage  Sophinia  precious to her Father's Mind  To her alone was ev'ry Wish confin'd  Nor did the Virgin less deserve his Care  Her guiltless Soul was like her Person fair  For Heav'n to form this matchless Beauty join'd  Her Mother's Features to her Father's Mind  Not op'ning Roses nor the bashful Day  Blush'd half so sweetly as  Sophinia  gay  Her Eyes were dazzling and her Temples fair  And ev'ry Feature wore a smiling Air  For Wit and Learning she outstrip'd her Kind  Nor cou'd her Sex debase her noble Mind  In search of Knowledge she wou'd spend the Day  And Judgment walk'd before her guiltless Way  Not many Furlongs from those blissful Plains  Where good  Clytiphon  rul'd the happy Swains  There liv'd a wealthy and a worthy Peer  Lov'd by his Friends and to his Country dear  Laon  the great in Valour justly fam'd  His Sons  Lycander  and  Polyphon  nam'd  Both noble Youths and by their Friends admir'd  And Thirst of Glory both their Hearts inspir'd  Lycander  's Form was fairer than his Mind  His Shape was faultless and his Brow sublime  His jetty Locks in mazy Ringlets run  And his bright Eyes were like a Morning Sun  Rays quick and fierce their subtle Light'nings fling  His Cheeks were fresher than the dawning Spring  But then as Tempests o'er the Ocean roll  Continual Passion tore his boiling Soul  Disdainful proud with an imperious Will  Headlong he rush'd on unsuspected Ill  Reason in vain oppos'd her sacred Shield  And Virtue's self must to the Whirlwind yield  Polyphon  's Soul was of a gentler Kind  No rugged Storms cou'd shake his easy Mind  Still calm and pleasant as the Ev'ning Skies  When not a Breeze through the still Region flies  No gloomy Frowns a sullen Heart betray  His Brow was thoughtless and his Air was gay  These to  Clytiphon  's did their Sire attend  The pleasing Mansion of their Father's Friend  With Lovers Eyes they both  Sophinia  view  As with her Years her rising Beauty grew  With airy Hopes they nurs'd the rival Flame  And sought with Gifts to win the smiling Dame  But she too cautious to be soon betray'd  Their Merit balanc'd and their Tempers weigh'd  Lycander  's Fortune pleas'd the lovely Dame  His Power Titles and his rising Fame  And the gay Maid beheld with early Pride  Laon  's bright Heir attending at her Side  That way wou'd oft her Vanity incline  But then her Reason fear'd his base Design  Still at her Heart the sullen Doubt remains  And put a Period to the golden Dreams  Polyphon  's Image on her Fancy stole  With thousand Beauties in his taintless Soul  Clear as his Face and sprightly as his Mien  Soft as his Voice and like his Brow serene  Polyphon  now the wavering Nymph admires  Nor thinks of Castles Towns and shining Spires  Her changing Thoughts prefer an easy Home  And dwell with Patience on a younger Son  Lycander  once her Fav'rite was but now  He meets Resentment and a frozen Brow  In vain to move the scornful Nymph he tries  With sprightly Oaths and well dissembl'd Lies  His Form no more can please  Sophinia  's Eyes  Without Concern he met the Fair's Disdain  Nor cou'd her Frown disturb the haughty Swain  Conscious of Merit he pursu'd her still  And only thought her Tongue bely'd her Will  For Impudence to Vice a trusty Squire  Who bears her Arms and fans her purple Fire  Had taught  Lycander  that Affairs of Love  Are not regarded in the Realms above  That Oaths are licens'd to address th' Fair  And Vows to Virgins but the Sport of Air  That Maids are Merchandise and may be sold  For charming Eloquence and mighty Gold  II  A Grove there was a venerable Shade  No hostile Iron durst her Boughs invade  Whose lofty Pines for sev'ral Ages grew  And rev'rend Oaks a hundred Winters knew  A crystal River wander'd halfway round  The rest defended with a hasel Mound  'Twas here to shun  Lycander  's jealous Eye  When  Sol  departed to the western Sky  The sly  Sophinia  us'd to leave her Maids  And meet  Polyphon  in the balmy Shades  While the proud Youth who found himself despis'd  His Person slighted and  Polyphon  priz'd  Grew wild with Love and desp'rate with Despair  And vow'd Destruction to the gentle Pair  No quiet Hour his surly Spirit knows  Nor Rest by Daylight or at Night Repose  Cold to his Friends and if they ask his Care  He only answers with a fullen Glare  One Ev'ning when the sparkling Sun withdrew  And thirsty Flowers sip'd the grateful Dew  When this fair Grove had put on all her Charms  And Zephyrs play'd amidst her curling Arms  Sophinia  weary of the sultry Day  To the cool Forest took her lonely Way  Attentive only to the Linnets Song  No ill she thought of and she fear'd no Wrong  Pleas'd with the Glories of the smiling Year  For guilty Minds are only taught to fear  The wellknown Path her willing Feet pursue  Through the brown Shade where in the Centre grew  A Row of Laurels crown'd with lasting Green  And softer Beech and flow'ring Rose between  Here in a fatal Hour  Sophinia  came  For proud  Lycander  watch'd the lovely Dame  Revenge and Love at once his Bosom fire  His broad Eyes flash with more than mortal Fire  Then to his Friends the raging Hero flew  His Friends a thoughtless and a wanton Crew  Whose slothful Hands were backward as their Will  In Virtue's Cause but resolute in Ill  To these the Youth disclos'd his rash Design  His glad Companions in th' Adventure join  That some well practis'd in the Ruffians Trade  Shou'd bear  Sophinia  from the silent Shade  The Mischief pleas'd yet none propos'd the Way  Tho' short the Time and dang'rous the Delay  In still suspense the list'ning Heroes stand  Till with rude Voice  Miranthus  thus began  ' A Castle has for many Centries stood  ' Within the Confines of the neigh'bring Wood  ' Whose gloomy Arches seem dispos'd to hide  ' Offended Subjects from a Tyrant's Pride  ' And often she has lent her hostile Towers  ' The guilty Refuge of rebellious Powers  ' Here let your Friends this peevish Girl convey  ' And keep her secret from the Face of Day  ' Those Doors with iron Eloquence shall plead  ' Your mighty Passion to the scornful Maid  ' You have what my unready Thought design'd  ' The hasty Dictates of a rustick Mind  ' A Mind inur'd to Wars and rude Alarms  ' Unskill'd in Love and Beauty's softer Charms  He ceas'dApplause was seen in ev'ry Eye  And Peals of Laughter rent the troubl'd Sky  Two fav'rite Heroes singl'd from the Crew  With hostile Feet that sacred Path pursue  Whose winding Maze betray'd the smiling Bower  That held  Sophinia  in a baneful Hour  The heedless Virgin on a Bank they found  Where the faint Primrose spreads her Odours round  And nodding Poppies seem'd to kiss the Ground  With frighted Eyes the trembling fair One sees  Their surly Figures through the parting Trees  But yet she rose collected in her Fear  'Twas vain to call and no Assistance near  Then from the Ground she rais'd her beauteous Eyes  And weeping turn'd them on the pitying Skies  Assist me Heaven and heavenly Pow'r she cries  You Saints that hover round celestial Springs  O take and wrap me in your sacred Wings  I see black Violence come frowning on  But may  Lycander  mourn the dearbought Wrong  Ah hear  Sophinia  in this fearful Hour  And save O save me from a Villain's Pow'r  But now a Slave whom Beauty ne'er cou'd charm  Drew nigh and seiz'd her by the ivory Arm  Through untrod Paths they bore the struggling Maid  To those rude Towers where  Lycander  stay'd  A dismal Dwelling hid by waving Trees  So thick they scarce admit the healthy Breeze  On whose black Walls condensing Vapours hung  Whose lofty Spires hardly knew the Sun  His Beams ne'er enter'd here but in the Room  Perpetual Coldness and eternal Gloom  Here the pleas'd Youth his charming Prey secures  And round his Pris'ner shut the plated Doors  Then left the Virgin to herself nor stay'd  To bear Reproaches from the injur'd Maid  Fierce as he was he like a Coward flies  The Rage that sparkl'd in her glowing Eyes  But when he thought the dang'rous Storm was o'er  Again he sought those Eyes he fled before  Like some pale Wretch impatient for his Doom  His fearful Steps approach'd the hallow'd Room  For rising Conscience now her Task began  And guilty Blushes through his Features ran  Unusual Horrors o'er his Passage hung  At ev'ry Step the sounding Portals rung  Before the Door he took a silent Stand  And the pale Taper trembl'd in his Hand  A hollow Voice  Lycander  seem'd to call  And Shadows danc'd along the gloomy Wall  His haughty Spirit was at this dismay'd  Lycander  trembl'd and was once afraid  Why beats my Heart my coward Heart he cries  And why this Mist before my dazzl'd Eyes  Sophinia  's mine and I will seize my Store  If thousand Spectres guard the awful Door  Then rushing in the lovely Dame he found  In fullen Posture and in Thought profound  The wonted Roses from her Cheeks were fled  On her fair Hand reclin'd her beauteous Head  With Flatt'ry first he tip'd his artful Tongue  And strove to palliate and excuse the Wrong  Let not  Sophinia  with a Smile he cries  Think we have seiz'd her as a hostile Prize  The Fault we owe to this unconquer'd Flame  Love was the Aggressor and be his the blame  Trust not thy Reason to a haughty Guide  Nor call that Honour which is only Pride  Honour a pageant Mistress of the vain  The Virgin's Tyrant and the Hero's Chain  If sparkling Wealth can please thy brighter Eyes  The Mines of  Persia  at thy Feet shall rise  And when thy Chariot marks the dusty Fields  Full thirty Slaves shall grace the shining Wheels  For thee the East shall yield her spicy Bowers  And sweeter Baths distil from weeping Flowers  Then smile my fair One and be timely wise  The Maid reply'd and roll'd her scornful Eyes  Hence fawning Traitor why wouldst thou be told  How much I hate thy Person and thy Gold  Mistaken Nature with too nice a Care  In vain has shap'd thee in a Mold so fair  Vice will be Vice howe'er 'tis polish'd o'er  Thou Villain dare to meet my Eyes no more  Those gloomy Birds that love the midnight Air  And hover round the Mansions of Despair  When to their Shrieks the hollow Roofs rebound  And the hoarse Raven aids the dreadful Sound  Tho' howling Wolves shou'd with their Voices join  Are less offensive to my Ears than thine  Beyond my Hate if yet a Thought remain  To make thy Spirit curse the galling Chain  If with those Thorns that Love's soft Empire bounds  Successful Rivals give the deepest Wounds  I love thy Brother and if that can be  With Passion equal to my Hate for thee  She saidAnd Rage possest  Lycander  's Soul  His pale Lips tremble and his Eyeballs roll  Three times he rais'd a Dagger to her Breast  But mighty Love his daring Hand suppress'd  And now shrill Cries invade his wond'ring Ears  The noise of Battle and the clash of Spears  Starting he turn'd nor staid to make reply  Tho' Fury sparkl'd in his threat'ning Eye  To Arms his Friends in mingled Voices call  And Danger hover'd o'er the frowning Wall  III  In that sad Hour when the frighted Maid  Was drawn by Villains from the mourning Shade  Polyphon  to th' appointed Forest came  He reach'd the Bower but he miss'd the Dame  Through balmy Paths with infant Roses bound  Where blushing Daisies strew the painted Ground  He rov'd impatient of the Nymph's Delay  And often doubted to return or stay  By chance he turn'd his mournful Eye and sees  His Friend  Acanthus  through the parting Trees  The Youth drew nearer with an eager Pace  Amazement hover'd on his boding Face  And thus impatient to  Polyphon  said  Where is  Sophinia  where thy darling Maid  This Ev'ning restless tho' I know not why  When setting  Phoebus  stain'd the western Sky  To these sweet Shades I took my heedless Way  To share the Fragrance of declining Day  Alone and pensive as I wander'd here  A Woman's Voice surpris'd my list'ning Ear  To yon rude Tow'rs I trac'd the sinking Sound  Till the still'd Outcries were in distance drown'd  What think you now I fear some threat'ning Ill  From headstrong Passion and imperious Will  I fear  Sophinia  and yourself betray'd  I know your Brother loves the beauteous Maid  Then hear my Vow the frantick Lover cries  And turn'd his Eyeballs on the glimm'ring Skies  Hear me ye Pow'rs whose sacred Hands sustain  These Worlds of Nature in a mighty Chain  If my fierce Brother has presum'd to bear  And from her Bowers force my injur'd Fair  These wakeful Eyelids shall no more be clos'd  This Spirit rested nor these Limbs repos'd  This vengeful Rapier shall be sheath'd no more  Till the rude Traitor shall his Prize restore  He said and raging left the gloomy Shade  Full of Resentment for his injur'd Maid  Acanthus  summon'd to a neighb'ring Plain  Their Friends a little but a martial Train  Twice twenty Youths their Gen'ral's Voice attend  And share the Quarrel of their injur'd Friend  Polyphon  pleas'd to see the assembl'd Pow'rs  Led his small Squadron to the hostile Towers  The frowning Portals well secur'd they found  The gloomy Court with Centries guarded round  Who spite of Reason and their Country's Laws  Were drawn to combat in a guilty Cause  The first of these  Cyrenus  fair and young  Whose curling Locks below his Shoulders hung  Too rashly bold encounter'd hand to hand  Fierce  Polyarchus  of  Polyphon  's Band  The pointed Jav'lin sped beneath his Chin  And streaming Purple stain'd his beauteous Skin  His very Cheeks are wash'd with deeper Dyes  And lasting Slumber seals his swimming Eyes  This piteous Sight enrag'd the vicious Train  But mostly  Iphis  Brother of the slain  Revenge he cry'd and hurl'd his deathful Dart  It hiss'd along but miss'd the Hero's Heart  Despairing raging on the Youth he flew  While down his Forehead roll'd the sultry Dew  Blows answer Blows and round their Temples sing  The glancing Weapons and the Bucklers ring  Aloof they fight or now in Circles wheel'd  Each thought to conquer both disdain to yield  Till  Polyarchus  with a sideway Blow  Transpierc'd the Liver of his heedless Foe  He drew the Weapon from his tortur'd Side  The gaping Wound disgorg'd a purple Tide  His Eyes turn'd upward with a ghastly Roll  Headlong he fell and sob'd away his Soul  Now Joy transported the victorious Throng  With  Polyarchus  all the Welkin rung  Applause and Clamour shook the trembling Ground  Lycander  heard and curs'd the hated Sound  Griev'd for his Friend he with the foremost press'd  And all their Lances glitter round his Breast  But the strong Shield their Points at distance holds  Where two fair Eagles spread their Wings in Gold  A weighty Spear his better Hand supplies  And livid Light'nings sparkle in his Eyes  Vinario  first sustain'd the Warrior's Rage  The beauteous Darling of his Father's Age  His tender Arm the deadly Spear arrests  And tore his Shoulder from his ivory Breast  Too late his Friends to his Assistance run  For his black Eyes no more behold the Sun  Miranthus  next did his bright Lance extend  A blust'ring Soldier and  Lycander  's Friend  Him  Merias  met old  Meriander  's Heir  The youthful Husband of  Lycosia  fair  Now born untimely from his Father's Side  His smiling Fortunes and his lovely Bride  Just at his Hip the Steel an Entrance found  And tore his Bowels with a ghastly Wound  Back fell the Youth his tinkling Arms reply  Loud Shrieks and Clamours rend the frighted Sky  Polyphon  now with deadly Anguish stung  His ready Jav'lin at the Victor flung  The erring Weapon with a whistling Sound  Flew o'er his Head and plough'd the distant Ground  Enrag'd to see the bloodless Point descend  And miss the Vengeance for his bleeding Friend  His shining Eyes that did with Fury glow  He turn'd and thus defy'd the stronger Foe  Hope not for Conquest mighty Clown he cries  From thy stern Visage and gigantick Size  A little Arm if Heav'n direct the Blow  May send thee howling to the Shades below  Slave cries  Miranthus  with a stormy Glare  Go wash thy Face and curl thy waving Hair  Thy coward Heart belies thy daring Tongue  He spoke and drove his weighty Spear along  The failing Mischief on the Buckler sung  Not so  Polyphon  sent his faithful Dart  The speedy Vengeance reach'd the Hero's Heart  Down fell the Knight his clanging Arms rebound  And his proud Soul came rushing thro' the Wound  Lycander  saw but turn'd his Eyes away  Where in the Dust the mighty Soldier lay  Then like a Whirlwind rush'd the Youth along  And sought his Brother in the hostile Throng  Polyphon  's Spear his frantick Hand arrests  And hurl'd the Weapon at its Owner's Breast  The missive Death deceiv'd his bloody Hand  Its thirsty Point lay shiver'd in the Sand  Suspence and Horror held the martial Crew  And the sick Moon receiv'd a paler Hue  The Stars retir'd from the hated Sight  And wrap'd their Glories in the Clouds of Night  Polyphon  cry'd O stay thy hostile Arm  The Name of Brother wears a potent Charm  Our Mother did in Youth's fair Bloom expire  And left us Infants to our tender Sire  And till  Sophinia  blew this deadly Flame  Our Fears were equal and our Hopes the same  The same our Pleasures and the like our Woes  We slept together and as fondly rose  Then let O let not murd'rous Rage divide  Our Hearts but lay those threat'ning Arms aside  Let ranc'rous Hate possess our Souls no more  Thou to her Friends the beauteous Maid restore  Then let her Voice our rival Cause decide  And him she favours wed the smiling Bride  He said but Rage had stop'd  Lycander  's Ears  Base Slave he cry'd thou Child of puny Fears  Not  Laon  's Son thy Soul disclaim her Race  My Mother ne'er produc'd a Thing so base  Some fairy Elf or treach'rous Nurse beguil'd  My sleeping Parents of their lawful Child  Then in his Place her dunghil Offspring laid  And my young Brother to her Hut convey'd  This was thy Mother coarser than her Fate  And thou the Son of her plebeian Mate  Here ceas'd the Youthfor Actions spoke the rest  And hurl'd a Jav'lin at  Polyphon  's Breast  His Shield receiv'd it with a smart Rebound  The missive Weapon trembl'd on the Ground  Now hand to hand the rival Youths engage  Lycander  burn'd with more than mortal Rage  Black Fury roll'd in each relentless Eye  Both fought to conquer or resolv'd to die  But now  Lycander  tho' with Hate inspir'd  By fits was fainting and by fits respir'd  Polyphon  's Sword a fatal Passage found  Beneath his Arm a deep and ghastly Wound  Stagg'ring he drop'd and grasp'd the bloody Ground  Yet as he liv'd without a Groan he fell  Nor drew a Sigh but only cry'd 'Tis well  'Tis well my Fury with my Life shall end  Farewel my Brother and at last my Friend  By our dear Parent see me quickly laid  Be thine the Conquest thine the beauteous Maid  He paus'd and then with feebler Accent cries  My Friends Farewel and clos'd his swimming Eyes  The mourning Victor bending o'er the slain  Essay'd to raise him but essay'd in vain  His failing Arms resign'd their feeble Hold  And Drops of Horror from his Temples roll'd  From each cold Cheek the blushing Beauty flies  And the Ground danc'd before his dazzl'd Eyes  The weeping Youth with friendly Force divide  The gentle Mourner from his Brother's Side  Then Friends and Foes united gather round  And lift the bleeding Body from the Ground  Some raise the drooping Head and others press'd  Their careful Arms around his manly Breast  Tho' with black Dust and hostile Crimson stain'd  Its native Fierceness still the Face retain'd  Back on his Shoulders fell his graceful Hair  And the grand Features wore a scornful Air  Now all too late the rash Adventure blame  Pale Conquest sigh'd and loath'd her hated Name  From the black Tow'rs their solemn Steps return  And both the Victors and the Vanquish'd mourn  The QUESTION  Occasion'd by a serious Admonition  IS Mirth a Crime Instruct me you that know  Or shou'd these Eyes with Tears eternal flow  No let ye Powers let this Bosom find  Life's one grand Comfort a contented Mind  Preserve this Heart and may it find no room  For pale Despondence or unpleasing Gloom  Too well the Mischief and the Pangs we know  Of doubtful Musing and prophetick Woe  But now these Evils for a Moment rest  And brighter Visions please the quiet Breast  Where sprightly Health its blessed Cordial pours  And chearful Thought deceives the gliding Hours  Then let me smile and trifle while I may  Yet not from Virtue nor from Reason stray  From hated Slander I wou'd keep my Tongue  My Heart from Envy and from Guilt my Song  Nature's large Volume with Attention read  Its God acknowledge and believe my Creed  Through Weakness not Impiety offend  But love my Parent and esteem my Friend  If like the most my undistinguish'd Days  Deserve not much of Censure or of Praise  If my still Life like subterraneous Streams  Glides unobserv'd nor tainted by Extremes  Nor dreadful Crime has stain'd its early Page  To hoard up Terrors for reflecting Age  Let me enjoy the sweet Suspence of Woe  When Heav'n strikes me I shall own the Blow  Till then let me indulge one simple Hour  Like the pleas'd Infant o'er a painted Flow'r  Idly 'tis true But guiltlesly the Time  Is spent in trifling with a harmless Rhyme  Heroick Virtue asks a noble Mind  A Judgment strong and Passions well refin'd  But if that Virtue's measur'd by the Will  'Tis surely something to abstain from Ill  The SACRIFICE  An EPISTLE to CELIA  IF you dear  Celia  cannot bear  The low Delights that others share  If nothing will your Palate fit  But Learning Eloquence and Wit  Why you may sit alone I ween  'Till you're devour'd with the Spleen  But if Variety can please  With humble Scenes and careless Ease  If Smiles can banish Melancholy  Or Whimsy with its Parent Folly  If any Joy in these there be  I dare invite you down to me  You know these little Roofs of mine  Are always sacred to the Nine  This Day we make a Sacrifice  To the  Parnassian  Deities  Which I am order'd by  Apollo  To shew you in the Words that follow  As first we purge the hallow'd Room  With soft Utensil call'd a Broom  And next for you a Throne prepare  Which vulgar Mortals call a Chair  While Zephyrs from an Engine blow  And bid the sparkling Cinders glow  Then gather round the mounting Flames  The Priestess and assembl'd Dames  While some inferior Maid shall bring  Clear Water from the bubbling Spring  Shut up in Vase of sable Dye  Secure from each unhallow'd Eye  Fine wheaten Bread you next behold  Like that which  Homer  sings of old  And by some unpolluted Fair  It must be scorch'd with wond'rous Care  So far 'tis done And now behold  The sacred Vesselsnot of Gold  Of polish'd Earth must they be form'd  With Painting curiously adorn'd  These Rites are past And now must follow  The grand Libation to  Apollo  Of Juices drawn from magick Weeds  And Pith of certain  Indian  Reeds  For Flow'r of Milk the Priestess calls  Her Voice reechoes from the Walls  With hers the sister Voices blend  And with the od'rous Steam ascend  Each fair One now a Sibyl grows  And ev'ry Cheek with Ardour glows  And tho' not quite beside their Wits  Are seiz'd with deep prophetick Fits  Some by mysterious Figures show  That  Celia  loves a shallow Beau  And some by Signs and Hints declare  That  Damon  will not wed  Ziphair  Their Neighbours Fortunes each can tell  So potent is the mighty Spell  This is the Feast and this my Friend  Are you commanded to attend  Yes at your Peril But adieu  I've tir'd both myself and you

you wou'd have your Daughters wise  Take care to mend your Sons  The DEATH of ABEL  WHEN from the Shade of  Eden  's blissful Bow'rs  Its Fruit ambrosial and immortal Flow'rs  Our gen'ral Mother who too soon rebell'd  Was with the Partner of her Crime expell'd  To Fields less fruitfulwhere the rugged Soil  With Thorns and Thistles often paid their Toil  Where the pale Flow'rs soon lost their chearful Hue  And rushing Tempests o'er the Mountains flew  Two Sons the Matron in her Exile bore  Unlike in Feature but their Natures more  The eldest Youth for Husbandry renown'd  Tore up the Surface of the steril Ground  His nervous Arms for rugged Tasks were form'd  His Cheek but seldom with a Smile adorn'd  Drops rais'd by Labour down his Temples run  His Temples tarnish'd by the midday Sun  Robust of Body and of Soul severe  Unknown to Pity and the like to Fear  Not so his Brother cast in fairer Mold  Was heand softer than his fleecy Fold  Fair were his Cheeks that blush'd with rosy Dye  Peace dwelt for ever in his chearful Eye  Nor Guilt nor Rage his gentle Spirit knew  Sweet were his Slumbers for his Cares were few  Those were to feed and watch the tender Lamb  And seek fresh Pasture for its bleating Dam  From burning Suns his thirsty Flocks to hide  And seek the Vales where limpid Rivers glide  'Twas ere rude Hands had reap'd the waving Grain  When Plenty triumph'd on the fertile Plain  That to the Centre of a pleasant Down  Where half was Pasture half a plenteous Brown  These Youths repair'd both emulous of Fame  And rais'd an Altar to  Jehovah  's Name  With Heart elate and selfpresuming Eye  First to the Pile unhappy  Cain  drew nigh  Choice was his Off'ring yet no Sign appear'd  No Flame was seen nor Voice celestial heard  Astonish'd stood the late presumptuous Man  Then came his Brother with a trembling Lamb  His God accepts the Sacrifice sincere  The Flames propitious round the Slain appear  The curling Smoke ascended to the Skies  This  Cain  beheld and roll'd his glowing Eyes  Stung to the Soul he with his frantick Hand  A Stone uprooted from the yielding Sand  Nor spokefor Rage had stop'd his failing Tongue  The heavy Death impetuous whirl'd along  This  Abel  methis Heart receiv'd the Wound  Amaz'd he fell and grasp'd the bloody Ground  The gentle Spirit sprung to endless Day  And left behind her Case of beauteous Clay  Pale stood the Brotherto a Statue chill'd  A conscious Horror through his Bosom thrill'd  His frighted Eyes abhorr'd the Beams of Light  And long'd to find a neverceasing Night  Shock'd at the Sight of Murder first begun  Down the steep Heavens roll'd the radiant Sun  Old Night assuming her appointed Sway  Stretch'd her black Mantle o'er the Face of Day  Now for their Leader mourn'd the bleating Lambs  That rov'd neglected by their pensive Dams  The careful Parents search the Fields around  They callthe Woods roll back an empty Sound  Within a Forest's solitary Gloom  Slept gentle  Abel  in a secret Tomb  And there beneath a Cypress Shade reclin'd  Cain  breath'd his Sorrows to the rushing Wind  That in the Branches made a doleful Sound  'Twas Silence else and horrid Darkness round  When lo a sudden and a piercing Ray  O'erspread the Forest with a Blaze of Day  And then descended on the hallow'd Ground  A Seraph with empyreal Glory crown'd  Afflicted  Cain  that knew not where to fly  Gaz'd on the Vision with distracted Eye  When thus the AngelWhy these mournful Cries  These loud Complaints that pierce the nightly Skies  Lye not to Heaven but directly say  Where roves thy Brother where does  Abel  stray  He saidand thus the guilty Wretch return'd  O sacred Guardian I for  Abel  mourn'd  I ne'er beheld him since the Day began  But why this Visit to a simple Man  Thus the CelestialWretch canst thou presume  Thy Brother's Blood may slumber in its Tomb  Or thou may'st ward off Vengeance with a Lye  And dare attempt deceiving God most high  But now thy Doom O wretched Mortal hear  The fleeting Hours nor the rolling Year  To thee nor Joy nor chearful Ease shall bring  Alike to thee the Winter and the Spring  Still vex'd with Woe thy heavy Days shall fly  Beneath a radiant or a gloomy Sky  Curs'd shalt thou be amidst thy vagrant Band  And curs'd the Labours of thy guilty Hand  He ceas'dBut  Cain  all prostrate on the Ground  Still in his Ears retain'd the dreadful Sound  At length he rose and trembling thus began  This is too muchtoo much for mortal Man  The mighty Debt O let me quickly pay  And sweep me instant from the Beams of Day  The yet unborn that I am curs'd shall know  And all shall hate me to augment the Blow  Ev'n my own Sons if such are giv'n to be  The Death of  Abel  shall revenge on me  Thus he to change the dreadful Sentence try'd  Thus the seraphick Messenger reply'd  This Mark O  Cain  I fix upon thy Brow  And thus by Heav'n's mighty Monarch vow  Who sheds thy Blood that Criminal shall be  Curs'dSev'n times curs'd and wretched more than thee  Thus be that Mortal who shall tear the Rod  Of scorching Vengeance from the Hand of God  That Man may learn to fear the King of Kings  He saidand waving his immortal Wings  That instant mingled with the starry Train  And Darkness wrap'd the silent Shades again  JOB'S CURSE and his APPEAL  Taken out of Job Chap i and xxxi  LET not that Day in circling Moments run  When first these Eyes beheld th' odious Sun  Let his gay Beams forsake the mourning Fields  And starting backward roll his flaming Wheels  Let sulphurous Hail descend in baneful Show'rs  And horrid Darkness mix the jumbling Hours  Let trembling Mortals gaze in vain for Light  Curs'd be the Day and doubly curs'd the Night  Thou my great Judge these Imprecations hear  And rend her Minutes from the rolling Year  To the sad Skies be every Star deny'd  While scorching Plagues on quivering Meteors ride  Let the black Air no melting Musick know  But ring with Horror and Complaints of Woe  Through the grim Shade let grisly Terrors run  And weeping Sorrows that abhor the Sun  Let paleey'd Spectres burst their yawning Tombs  And dreadful Echos shake th' hideous Gloom  The low'ring East pour down a lashing Storm  Nor through her Gates admit th' struggling Morn  Let the dark Hours no lively breaking see  Because they gave these ceaseless Tears to me  As others have alas why could not I  Yield my short Being and an Infant die  Why was a Mother's Care indulg'd to me  And why supported on her friendly Knee  Why did I in her tender Bosom grow  A foster'd Subject of impending Woe  Did friendly Death my marble Limbs enchain  This bleeding Heart would know no smarting Pain  Then lasting Sleep would seal my shaded Eyes  Where frozen Pride and conquer'd Vengeance lies  There weary Slaves forgotten Rest may find  And injur'd Orphans leave their Tears behind  Tyrannick Rage must in the Grave subside  Where starving Wretches find their Wants supplyd  Thrice happy Rest O why to me deny'd  Life still will hover round despairing Slaves  Who slight her Favours and would court their Graves  Death gliding by us shews his grizly Charms  But the coy Phantom mocks our reaching Arms  He flies the Dungeons of intreating Woe  And strikes the Prosp'rous with unwelcome Blow  To blooming Youth his partial Arrows fly  O'er wither'd Mendicants that vainly try  To meet the fatal Shaft and only wish to die  When Darkness sits as Regent of the Skies  And round my Bed redoubled Horrors rise  Till Night grows hideous with my constant Cries  My tortur'd Limbs with ceaseless Pangs are torn  But yet I live to see returning Morn  The piercing Sun thrusts in a spiteful Ray  To wound my Eyelids with unwelcome Day  Tyrannick Death whom trembling Mortals flee  The Prince of Ills to ev'ry Wretch but me  Plays with the Torments of my struggling Heart  And o'er my Bosom shakes his ling'ring Dart  O sacred Judge when will thy Wrath be done  Why do I live to scare the wond'ring Sun  Let not thy Mercy spare my wounded Clay  But strike and sweep me from offensive Day  My Heart is vexed with consuming Fears  And nourish'd only with continual Tears  Close at my Heels pursue a meagre Train  Of pining Sickness and distorting Pain  Paleey'd Confusion with dishivel'd Hair  And wild Impatience leading on Despair  Did I with Crimes profane my Days of Rest  Did e'er Presumption swell my rising Breast  Did guilty Flame my tainted Soul surprise  Or Snares of Beauty catch my wand'ring Eyes  If e'er Injustice swell'd my spreading Lands  If e'er Oppression stain'd my guiltless Hands  Then let my God his flaming Vengeance throw  Renew my Plagues and double every Woe  Did e'er my Servants of their Lord complain  Did humble Rhetorick ever plead in vain  In vain to me did helpless Widows cry  Or at my Gate neglected Orphans lie  No their glad Eyes my plenteous Table knew  And with my own the foster'd Infants grew  Was e'er my Portals barr'd against the Poor  Did not the Stranger bless my friendly Door  Tho' cold and hungry in my Courts he mourn'd  Joyful and full the smiling Wretch return'd  When every Good obey'd my lordly Will  Did I by Fraud my glitt'ring Coffers fill  Did I by Fraud increase the tempting Store  Or dote too fondly on the shining Ore  Did restless Envy in my Bosom roll  Or lurking Malice blot my tainted Soul  Nothis fond Heart has bled for distant Woe  And learn'd Compassion for a sinking Foe  Did e'er my Soul from its Creator run  To painted Idols or the beaming Sun  Or to the Moon my wav'ring Senses yield  When her pale Rays adorn'd the glist'ring Field  Yet stay presumptuous Wretch nor urge too far  Thy doubtful Sentence at the dreadful Bar  What melting Rhet'rick or what potent Friend  At Heav'n's Tribunal shall thy Cause defend  Where smother'd Evils hid from mortal Eye  Mature and open to Omniscience lie  The TALE of CUSHI  From II Samuel Chap xviii  HOW fares my Son the trembling Monarch cry'd  Why wouldst thou ask afflicted  Cush  reply'd  A Fate like his may all that hate thee feel  Whose Blood alas has stain'd the guilty Steel  He fell beneath the Hand of  David  's Friend  But to my Story let my Lord attend  When the pale Morning shew'd her languid Face  And the dim Sun began his usual Race  Whose sullen Orb receiv'd a crimson Dye  And Tempests hover'd in the frowning Sky  As tho' the Heavens wept a Mortal's Fate  And Nature trembl'd at domestick Hate  Within the Shade of  Ephraim  's dusky Wood  In just Array the meeting Armies stood  The frowning Hosts with equal Fury glow  And each to Death defy'd his meeting Foe  All tender Thoughts were lost in horrid Rage  And with a Shout the charging Hosts engage  Then Clouds of Arrows hide the darken'd Sky  And hissing Lances lighten as they fly  Dreadful the Sight and horrid was the Cry  Here groan'd a Steed that felt its smarting Wound  And there a Soldier pinion'd to the Ground  At length proud  Israel  began to fail  Our juster Cause cou'd o'er their Strength prevail  The vanquish'd Army rais'd a fearful Cry  And thro' the Wood their mighty Numbers fly  There horrid Brambles tore their Wounds anew  And thousand Deaths their flying Heels pursue  Then rag'd our Gen'ral thro' the dreadful Gloom  Pale Terror hover'd on his waving Plume  From his known Spear the shrieking Numbers run  And from his Fury fled your conquer'd Son  Grim Danger urg'd him on with fatal Speed  And thro' black Shades he lash'd the weary Steed  In the dark Center of this Forest stood  A lofty Oak which overlook'd the Wood  Thro' its thick Arms he ventur'd careless in  They springing caught him by the beauteous Chin  His curling Locks among the Branches flew  His Spirit fails him and his Foes pursue  Around in vain he cast a mournful Eye  And wish'd a Friend for none alas was nigh  But hostile Shouts invade his frighted Ears  And soon beneath him shone a Grove of Spears  Now Traitor fallour mighty Leader cries  While glowing Vengeance sparkl'd in his Eyes  Then step'd a Captain of the loyal Band  And vainly strove to stay his fatal Hand  That cruel Arm impell'd the flying Dart  And the keen Weapon sunk within his Heart  Then those fair Cheeks resign'd their rosy Dye  Yet Life a Moment struggl'd in his Eye  As from so fair a Mansion loth to fly  Till the red Torrent stain'd his throbbing Tide  Then with a Groan the beauteous Rebel dy'd  Hold"stop thy Story"cries the weeping King  Thy horrid Tale has left a mortal Sting  My Soul tho' practis'd in the Paths of Woe  Grows sick and staggers at this mighty Blow  From its cold Fountain Life forgets to run  Oh  Absalom  Oh  Absalom  my Son  Eternal Shade has seal'd thy chearful Eyes  And on the Ground thy breathless Beauty lies  Curst be the Hand that all my Hopes beguil'd  And left a Parent to lament his Child  Without a Tear let none his Story tell  But curse the Forest where my Darling fell  While these wan Eyes with lasting Sorrows run  Lost to the World and Strangers to the Sun  Let milder Songs attend his noontide Ray  For mine will best become the closing Day  While round my Lyre afflicted Fathers throng  And Orphans listen to the mournful Song  PROSERPINE'S RAGOUT  AS once grave  Pluto  drove his royal Wheels  O'er the large Confines of the  Stygian  Fields  With kingly Port he sat and by his Side  Rode his fair Captive now his awful Bride  But from the Lakes a

the Lay  As mild as Ev'ning and as Morning gay  Not the fresh Blooms on yonder Codlingtree  Nor the white Hawthorn half so fair as he  Nor the young Daisy dress'd in Morning Dew  Nor the Pea Blossom wears a brighter Hue  LUCY  None knows like him to strew the wheaten Grain  Or drive the Ploughshare o'er the fertile Plain  To raise the Sheaves or reap the waving Corn  Or mow brown Stubble in the early Morn  PHEBE  How mild the Youth when on a sultry Day  In yonder Vale we turn'd the fragrant Hay  How on his Voice the list'ning Shepherds hung  Not tuneful  Stella  half so sweetly sung  LUCY  Whether he binds the Sheaf in twisted Band  Or turns the Pitchfork on his nimble Hand  He's sure to win a Glance from ev'ry Eye  While clumsy  Colin  stands neglected by  PHEBE  His curling Locks by far more lovely shew  Than the white Wig on Squire  Fopling  's Brow  And when the Shepherd on a rainy Day  Weaves for his Hat a Wisp of flow'ry Hay  The scarlet Feather not so gay appears  Which on his Crown Sir  Ambrose Fino  wears  LUCY  For  Anthony Meriah  leaves her Cow  And stands to gape at him upon the Mow  While he for who but must that Wench despise  Throws Straws and Cobwebs on her staring Eyes  PHEBE  To the Backdoor I saw proud  Lydia  hie  To see the Team with  Anthony  go by  He slily laugh'd and turn'd him from the Door  I thought the Damsel would have spoke no more  LUCY  Me once he met 'twas when from yonder Vale  Each Morn I brought the heavy milking Pail  He took it from my Head and with a Smile  Reach'd out his Hand and help'd me o'er the Stile  PHEBE  As I was dancing late amongst the Crew  A yellow Pippin o'er my Head he threw  Sue  bit her Lips and  Barbaretta  frown'd  And  Phillis  look'd as tho' she wou'd have swoon'd  Thus sung the Maids till  Colinet  came by  And  Rodrigo  from weeding of the Rye  Each took his Lass and sped 'em to the Town  To drink cool Cider at the  Hare  and  Hound  The Damsels simper like the sparkling Beer  And  Colin  shines till  Anthony  is near  On the Death of a justly admir'd AUTHOR  WHEN paleey'd Winter rules the mourning Fields  And shiv'ring Nature to his Sceptre yields  Dejected Earth is strip'd of all her Pride  And sculking Flowers in her Bosom hide  Through naked Groves afflicted Warblers fly  And Storms of Hail come rattling through the Sky  But when soft  April  lifts her downy Wing  And calls the blushing Infants of the Spring  The verdant Groves their wonted Charms regain  And laughing Nature paints the gaudy Plain  Sweetscented Vi'lets take their usual Blue  And the fair Primrose drinks the Morning Dew  Again revive their Beauty and their Smell  But Man once blasted takes a long Farewel  Ah silly Muse thy fond Complaints give o'er  Departed  Sylvius  shall return no more  No Charms of Verse can win the heav'nly Mind  Back to the slighted Case she left behind  Not tho' each Line shou'd make our Bosoms glow  Like his grand Numbers and as sweetly flow  His Name shall last to warm a distant Age  Nor want th' Assistance of a Titlepage  For his bright Lines are by their Lustre known  Ev'n  Homer  shines with Beauties not his own  Unpolish'd Souls like  Codrus  or like mine  Fill'd with Ideas that but dimly shine  Read o'er the Charms of his instructive Pen  And taste of Raptures never known till then  Illnature listen'd and approv'd the Song  And blushing Envy check'd her burning Tongue  Happy are those tho' Grief their Hours attend  Whom once he honour'd with the Name of Friend  Whose pleasing Thoughts at least may ponder o'er  The smiling Days that shall return no more  Ev'n we condemn'd at distance to admire  Bewail the Hopes that with our Guide expire  Ah who shall now our rustick Thoughts refine  And to grave Sense and solid Learning join  Wit ever sparkling and the Sweets of Rhyme  Farewel ye Themes which none but he can sing  And sylvan Scenes that wear eternal Spring  Fair Nymphs that in his fairer Paintings glow  And ye smooth Lines that  Sylvius  taught to flow  But hush sad Muse thy dull Complaint give o'er  Hence sigh in secret and his Loss deplore  Who ne'er O ne'er shall grace our Regious more  An EPITAPH  NOW triumph Death for here lies slain  More worth than Crowns can buy  Celestial Zephyrs waft her Soul  Back to its native Sky  Who now shall charm where  Flavia  once  Her chearful Smiles bestow'd  When pleasing Candor swell'd her Breast  And in her Aspect glow'd  Now to that Heav'n where Virtue shines  With an eternal Blaze  Her lofty Soul has wing'd its Flight  And left this earthly Maze  So from the smiling Infant's Hand  We force the costly Gem  Which he not knowing how to prize  Might to the Dust condemn  On WINTER  WHAT Pictures now shall wanton Fancy bring  Or how the Muse to  Artemisia  sing  Now shiv'ring Nature mourns her ravish'd Charms  And sinks supine in Winter's frozen Arms  No gaudy Banks delight the ravish'd Eye  But northern Breezes whistle thro' the Sky  No joyful Choirs hail the rising Day  But the froze Crystal wraps the leafless Spray  Brown look the Meadows that were late so fine  And cap'd with Ice the distant Mountains shine  The silent Linnet views the gloomy Sky  Sculks to his Hawthorn nor attempts to fly  Then heavy Clouds send down the feather'd Snow  Through naked Trees the hollow Tempests blow  The Shepherd sighs but not his Sighs prevail  To the soft Snow succeeds the rushing Hail  And these white Prospects soon resign their room  To melting Showers or unpleasing Gloom  The Nymphs and Swains their aking Fingers blow  Shun the cold Rains and bless the kinder Snow  While the faint Travellers around them see  Here Seas of Mud and there a leafless Tree  No budding Leaves nor Honeysuckles gay  No yellow Crowfoots paint the dirty Way  The Lark sits mournful as afraid to rise  And the sad Finch his softer Song denies  Poor daggled  Urs'la  stalks from Cow to Cow  Who to her Sighs return a mournful Low  While their full Udders her broad Hands assail  And her sharp Nose hangs dropping o'er the Pail  With Garments trickling like a shallow Spring  And his wet Locks all twisted in a String  Afflicted  Cymon  waddles through the Mire  And rails at  Win'fred  creeping o'er the Fire  Say gentle Muses say is this a Time  To sport with Poesy and laugh in Rhyme  While the chill'd Blood that hath forgot to glide  Steals through its Channels in a lazy Tide  And how can  Phoebus  who the Muse refines  Smooth the dull Numbers when he seldom shines  MIRA to OCTAVIA  FAIR One to you this Monitor I send  Octavia  pardon your officious Friend  You think your Conduct merits only Praise  But outlaw'd Poets censure whom they please  Thus we beginyour Servant has been told  That you despising Settlements and Gold  Determine  Florio  witty young and gay  To have and hold for ever and for ay  And view that Person as your mortal Foe  Who dares object against your charming Beau  But now to furnish Metre for my Song  Let us suppose  Octavia  may be wrong  'Tis true you're lovely yet the learn'd aver  That even Beauties like the rest may err  I know to shun you hold it as a Rule  The arrant Coxcomb and the stupid Fool  No such is  Florio  he has Wit'tis true  Enough  Octavia  to impose on you  Yet such a Wit you'll by Experience find  Worse than a Fool that's complaisant and kind  It only serves to gild his Vices o'er  And teach his Malice how to wound the more  I need not tell you most ingenious Fair  That hungry Mortals are not fed with Air  But solid Food And this voracious Clay  Asks Drink and Victuals more than once a Day  Now cou'd your  Florio  by his Wit inspire  The chilly Hearth to blaze with lasting Fire  Or when his Children round the Table throng  By an Allusion or a sprightly Song  Adorn the Board i'th' twinkling of an Eye  With a hot Pasty or a Warden Pye  There might be Reason on  Octavia  's Side  And not a Sage cou'd blame the prudent Bride  Yet or some Authors often deal in Lies  Lovers may live on Nuts and Blackberries  For roving Knights bewilder'd in their way  Who in black Forests half a Season stray  Unless they find Provision on the Trees  Must sup on Grass and breakfast on the Breeze  But as you've long been us'd to nicer Fare  Your Constitution wou'd but hardly bear  Such Food as this And therefore I advise  That you'd consider for you're mighty wise  If sober  Dusterandus  wou'd not make  A better Husband than your darling Rake  Grave  Dusterandus  He whose stedfast Mind  Is yet untainted tho' not much refin'd  Whose Soul ne'er roves beyond his native Fields  Nor asks for Joys but what his Pasture yields  On Life's dull Cares with Patience can attend  A gentle Master and a constant Friend  Who in soft Quiet spends the guiltless Days  His Servants blessing and his Neighbours praise  Say would you in his happy Mansion reign  Toast of the Village and the rural Plain  With honest Friends your chearful Days beguile  While Peace and Plenty on your Table smile  Or cold and hungry writhe your tired Jaws  And dine with  Florio  upon Hips and Haws  In troth I think there's little room to pause  In spite of all romantick Poets sing  This Gold my Dearest is an useful thing  Not that I'd have you hoard the precious Store  For not a Wretch is like the Miser poor  Enjoy your Fortune with a chearful Mind  And let the Blessing spread amongst the Kind  But if there's none but  Florio  that will do  Write Ballads both and you may thriveAdieu  The SETTING SUN  To SILVIA  SEE  Silvia  see the sparkling Lamp of Day  From our fond Eyes he draws the trembling Ray  The curling Clouds pursue his short'ning Beams  And catch new Colours from the parting Gleams  From marshy Vales unhealthy Fogs arise  And gloomy Vapours fill the mourning Skies  A creeping Mist o'erspreads the silent Field  And drooping Flow'rs their Ev'ning Incense yield  On ev'ry Leaf the pearly Drops appear  And Nature weeps an universal Tear  So will it be when those fair Suns of thine  By Fate eclips'd their chearful Beams resign  When the just Heav'ns remand their beauteous Store  And  Silvia  's Eyes must chear the World no more  Death may forbid those dazzling Orbs to roll  But cannot strip the Radiance from thy Soul  Amid the Stars in spite of Fate or Time  The Charms of  Silvia  shall eternal shine  An EPITAPH  A Heart to Mercy as to Zeal inclin'd  As well a gentle as a prudent Mind  Still free to pardon cautious to offend  A tender Parent and a faithful Friend  All Parts perform'd she willingly withdrew  Turn'd from the World and bid her Friends adieu  Ah thou if Spirits or regard or know  The Sigh of Friendship or a Daughter's Woe  Mix'd with those Tears that wash the sacred Shrine  Accept the Tribute of a grateful Line  On SICKNESS  WHEN Heav'n's almighty King prepares  The angry Shaft to throw  Ev'n Fortitude itself despairs  To bear the deadly Blow  Cold Tremors shake each fainting Limb  That weeps a sickly Dew  The Features chang'd to pale and dim  Resign their chearful Hue  No more soft Eloquence shall flow  Nor dress the silent Tongue  But the dull Heart refuse to glow  Tho' charm'd by melting Song  Those laughing Eyes that lately shone  So sprightly and so gay  Sunk down with Sickness faint and wan  Decline the piercing Day  And scarcely bear a chearful Beam  To light the drooping Soul  While round the weak afflicted Brain  Romantick Vapours roll  Deceitful Earth and all its Joys  Elude our grasping Hands  Tho' Nature all her Skill employs  To bind the failing Bands  Death drives us to the horrid Steep  And while we vainly mourn  He pointing shews th'unmeasur'd Deep  From whence we ne'er return  There the grim Spectre with a Smile  His panting Victim sees  Who fain wou'd linger here a while  To swallow nauseous Lees  Who Death's great Empire wou'd dispute  And hugs the gilded Pill  Not knowing That his faithful Mute  Whose Business is to kill  The lost the slipp'ry Hold to save  To lenient Arts we run  They cast us headlong on the Wave  And we are twice undone  The Pow'r who stamp'd the reas'ning Mind  Its Partner can restore  There we a lasting Cordial find  And learn to sigh no more  But if the slowconsuming Ill  Shou'd lead us to the Grave  Our Faith persuades us that he will  The trembling Spirit save  O thou whose Bounty all things taste  Whose Anger none can bear  Revive the melancholy Breast  Nor let the Wretch despair  To a Gentleman with a Manuscript Play  AS some grave Matron bred on rural Downs  Who at the mention of a Topknot frowns  And the proud Minxes of the MarketTowns  Whose humble Senses are not much refin'd  But us'd to Labour with a chearful Mind  Clad in plain Coifs and Gown of russet Hue  With homespun Aprons of a decent Blue  From the white Curds extracts the greener Whey  Nor dreams of Fashion Poetry or Play  From wicked Verse she turns her cautious Eyes  And wonders People can delight in Lies  At length her Landlord the right noble Squire  Takes her young Daughter at her own Desire  Prefers the Damsel to attend his Spouse  And she with Joy resigns her brindl'd Cows  For  London  now prepares the smiling Dame  While her sad Mother trembles at the Name  But O what Griefs attend the parting Leave  No Muse can paint 'em nor no Heart conceive  In vain her Spouse or friendly Neighbour tries  To quell the Sorrows in her streaming Eyes  Rossell  she fears will slight her  Jersey  Gown  And wear white Aprons in the sinful Town  On the pure Ghost of  Win'fred  then she calls  To guard her Child within its guilty Walls  So this rude Babe I to your Mercy yield  Rough as the Soil of some untillag'd Field  Can Nature pleaseNot 'till she's well refin'd  Reforming Art shou'd follow close behind  But that proud Dame with me disdains to dwell  And far she fliesAh far from  Mira  's Cell  What then remains What Hope for me or mine  But the kind Silence of forgetful Time  To save us from the sly buffooning Leer  The spiteful Grimace and the scornful Sneer  The threat'ning Critic with his dreadful Rules  The Wit's keen Satire and the Burst of Fools  The wretched Villain pinion'd up on high  Two Hours pendent 'twixt the Earth and Sky  With Eggs and Turnips whirling round his Pate  Is but an Emblem of an Author's Fate  A dread Example to the rhyming Fry  So Poets tell me but I hope they lye  The World's goodnatur'd if it is not cross'd  But Wits are often saucy to their Cost  Tho' unassur'd yet not in deep Despair  I trust this Infant to its Patron's Care  Ah let your Roofs the simple Vagrants shield  I ask no more than Charity may yield  Some little Corner in the friendly Dome  Lest the loose Varlet be induc'd to roam  Where the cold Storms may hover round in vain  The chilling Snow or penetrating Rain  Where the fierce Rat all dreadful never climbs  Nor the sleek Mouse sad Foe to  Mira  's Rhymes  But I have donefor who implores a Friend  With long Petitions justly may offend  To no strait Bounds Goodnature is confin'd  And who shall dictate to a gen'rous Mind  Which not content in narrow Space to roll  Like the broad Ocean spreads from Pole to Pole  While the glad Nations bless the ample Tide  And wafted Treasures o'er its Surface glide  That still waves on regardless of their Praise  As you perhaps of  Mira  's idle Lays  SILVIA and the BEE  AS  Silvia  in her Garden stray'd  Where each officious Rose  To welcome the approaching Maid  With fairer Beauty glows  Transported from their dewy Beds  The new blown Lilies rise  Gay Tulips wave their shining Heads  To please her brighter Eyes  A Bee that sought the sweetest Flow'r  To this fair Quarter came  Soft humming round the fatal Bow'r  That held the smiling Dame  He search'd the op'ning Buds with Care  And flew from Tree to Tree  But  Silvia  finding none so fair  Unwisely fix'd on thee  Her Hand obedient to her Thought  The River did destroy  And the slain Insect dearly bought  Its momentary Joy  But now too rash unthinking Maid  Consider what you've done  Perhaps you in the Dust have laid  A fair and hopeful Son  Or from his Friends and Senate wise  Have swept a valu'd Peer  Whose life that you so lightly prize  Was to his Country dear  Then  Silvia  cease your Anger now  To this your guiltless Foe  And smooth again that gentle Brow  Where lasting Lilies blow  Soft  Cynthio  vows when you depart  The Sun withdraws its Ray  That Nature trembles like his Heart  And Storms eclipse the Day  Amintor  swears a Morning Sun's  Less brilliant than your Eyes  And tho' his Tongue at random runs  You seldom think he lyes  They tell you those soft Lips may vie  With Pinks at op'ning Day  And yet you slew a simple Fly  For proving what they say  Believe me not a Bud like thee  In this fair Garden blows  Then blame no more the erring Bee  Who took you for the Rose  The CRUEL PARENT  A DREAM  'TWAS when the Sun had his swift Progress made  And left his Empire to the Queen of Shade  Bright  Cynthia  too with her refulgent Train  Shot their pale Lustre o'er the dewy Plain  Sat lonely  Mira  with her Head reclin'd  And mourn'd the Sorrows of her helpless Kind  Then to her Fancy  Celia  's Woes appear  The Nymph whose Tale deserves a pitying Tear  Whose early Beauties met a swift Decay  A Rose that faded at the rising Day  While Grief and Shame oppress'd her tender Age  Pursu'd by Famine and a Father's Rage  Till too much Thought the aking Heart oppress'd  And  Mira  's Eyelids clos'd in silent Rest  Then active Fancy with her airy Train  Compos'd the Substance of the ensuing Dream  In a black Shade my wand'ring Self I found  A Wood encircl'd by a thorny Bound  Where Oaks uprais'd their kingly Heads on high  And the pleas'd Linnets thro' the Branches fly  There lofty Elms the wond'ring Skies invade  And the dark Cypress cast a browner Shade  Grave Laurels there the humbler Shrubs o'erlook  There the pale Ash and there the Poplar shook  Here pliant Elder whom her Fruits adorn  And the brown Hasel wove with shagged Thorn  Rude Briers there their clasping Tendrels twine  Whose rugged Arms with useless Roses shine  Beyond the Confines of the dusky Brake  A Plain was bounded with a putrid Lake  Where Planks of Timber stretch'd on mould'ring Beams  Form'd a weak Passage o'er the standing Streams  Whose slimy Waters to its Arches clung  Where wrap'd in Weeds the clodded Vermin hung  On this brown Plain surrounded by the Wood  And the green Lakean aged Castle stood  Whose iron Gates were strictly shut to all  And frowning Roofs hung o'er the crumbling Wall  Here perch'd Revenge and everwasting Care  And Melancholy with dishivel'd Hair  Before the Portals wait a grisly Band  Fraud with a Pencil in her shaking Hand  Long Scrolls of Parchment at her Feet were laid  Behind her Shoulder stood her ghastly Maid  Oppreffion nam'dand stretch'd her filthy Claw  And next pale Av'rice with insatiate Maw  Two cumbrous Bags his twining Arms infold  Of canker'd Silver and of useless Gold  Grimly he stands and by his Side appears  Fierce Cruelty all drench'd in Orphans Tears  Within attended by relentless Hate  Suspicion squinted through the barbarous Grate  To these rude Doors approach'd with bashful Mien  Soft  Celia  once the brightest of the Plain  But now the Roses from her Cheeks were flown  Nor cou'd the Fair One by her Charms be known  Those Charms are now in sable Weeds array'd  Her Arm supported by a mournful Maid  From her wan Eyes the Tears incessant flow  And all her Form was Penitence and Woe  But see  Lysegus  her relentless Sire  Whose Eyeballs sparkl'd with disdainful Ire  His potent Hand the sounding Locks obey  With grating Noise the horrid Gates gave way  Then prostrate at his Feet the Damsel lay  Three times to speak the lovely Mourner try'd  Thrice on her Lips the fainting Murmurs dy'd  Sigh follows Sigh and Tear succeeds to Tear  At length she cry'dAh may  Lysegus  hear  If Nature or if Penitence may sue  Ah let my Sorrows find Relief from you  The nightly Stars my constant Wailings know  The rising Sun is Witness to my Woe  But who shall paint what wretched  Celia  feels  While Shame and Famine hunt her flying Heels  The Fools deride me and the virtuous shun  Then to the Fields and lonely Shades I run  Yet find no Comfort from the lonely Shade  At my Approach the Blossoms seem to fade  I fly to Wilds unknown to human Kind  But cannot leave my hated Self behind  And amOh am Iby my Parent curs'd  Of all my Woes the deepest and the worst  She said  Lysegus  answer'd in a Rage  Hence vile Disturber of my luckless Age  Think not by Tears this stubborn Heart to win  Nor jar my Senses with thy hateful Din  Go learn of Vagrants fit Companions go  Their Arts of Stealing and their Whine of Woe  Yet when before the Gate of Pride you stand  And crave your Morsel at the Porter's Hand  May some stern Slave prevent the coming Prize  Thrown to the Dogs before thy longing Eyes  He ceas'dbut  Celia  views no more the Sun  For now her Sorrow with her Life was done  Her Eyes no more afford their lucid Streams  Nor the Pulse struggles in her quiet Veins  The Tyrant view'd her with a ghastly Look  His Heart beat heavy and his Sinews shook  When lo a Spectre horrible to view  Rose quick as Vapours of a Morning Dew  Whose Presence cast unpleasing Darkness round  A Cypress Wreath his faded Temples crown'd  Strange Forms were painted on his sable Robe  One Hand extended bore a crystal Globe  Where the pale Sinner might his Picture find  Yet not his Features but his darker Mind  In vain to shun the faithful Glass he tries  It plays unask'd before his aking Eyes  His quick left Hand with this perform'd its Part  His Right was dreadful with a poison'd Dart  Then with a loud and horrid Voice he cry'd  Lysegus  mourn thy Cruelty and Pride  From the fair Court of Equity I came  Call'd by thy Sins and Conscience is my Name  This venom'd Dart shall now thy Entrails tear  And teach thy Eyes to know the melting Tear  Prepare thy Spirits for their Weight of Woe  With  Celia  's Name I arm the dreadful Blow  He said and struckthe visionary Dart  Sought the dark Bottom of  Lysegus'  Heart  He felland falling rais'd a fearful Cry  Then  Mira  'woke and found the Morning Sky  A REQUEST to the DIVINE BEING  I  THOU great and sacred Lord of all  Of Life the only Spring  Creator of nunumber'd Worlds  Immensely glorious King  II  Whose Image shakes the stagg'ring Mind  Beyond Conception high  Crown'd with Omnipotence and veil'd  With dark Eternity  III  Drive from the Confines of my Heart  Impenitence and Pride  Nor let me in erroneous Paths  With thoughtless Idiots glide  IV  Whate'er thy alldiscerning Eye  Sees for thy Creature fit  I'll bless the Good and to the Ill  Contentedly submit  V  With humane Pleasure let me view  The prosp'rous and the great  Malignant Envy let me fly  With odious Selfconceit  VI  Let not Despair nor curs'd Revenge  Be to my Bosom known  Oh give me Tears for others Woe  And Patience for my own  VII  Feed me with necessary Food  I ask not Wealth nor Fame  But give me Eyes to view thy Works  And Sense to praise thy Name  VIII  And when thy Wisdom thinks it sit  To shake my troubled Mind  Preserve my Reason with my Griefs  And let me not repine  IX  May my still Days obscurely pass  Without Remorse or Care  And let me for the parting Hour  My trembling Ghost prepare  FINIS
