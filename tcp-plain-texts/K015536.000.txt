Sway  The fatal Produce of a Lustful Day  The ANOINTED HEAD how vicious Joys expose  A Soul in Anguish and a King in Woes  LIGHT Spots on  Ermin  are conspicuous shewn  And doubly glare the Follies of a Throne  How then Thy Crimes O DAVID shall we scan  Thou greatest Monarch Thou most Godlike Man  Or how the Frailty of our Frame confess  When GOD's distinguish'd Fav'rites thus transgress  THE  Sun  adown the Steep of Heav'n had roll'd  And fring'd the purple Clouds with Skirts of Gold  When shunning Grandeur and the Noise of State  On the High Turrets of the Royal Seat  DAVID the Sweets of deep Rebellion sought  Indulging all the Luxury of Thought  ON  Sion  's Mount the CedarFabrick stood  The ruin'd Honours of the  Tyrian  Wood  Hence stretch'd his Eye around his large Domain  And much he joy'd him in his ample Reign  Pleas'd cou'd the Present with the Past compare  The Regal Glories with the Rural Care  The Rural Care fair  Bethlem  's Hill renew'd  Which gently rising in the South he view'd  Life's Steps from that distinguish'd Day could trace  When tho' the youngest of the Sons of  Jesse  He first was destin'd by the Sacred Oil  To splendid Cares and Eminence of Toil  HOW did He once the  Bear  and  Lion  slay  While yet a Swain to save the fleecy Prey  At  Elah  how a Beardless Stripling dare  The grim gigantick Terror of the War  Harsh whiz'd the  Sling  and with a thund'ring Sound  He fell enormous o'er a Length of Ground  AND now resolv'd He as new Scenes he chose  How still new Labours and new Dangers rose  To Envy doom'd a Sacrifice to fall  How twice he 'scap'd the vengeful Hand of  Saul  And how he foil'd the proud  Goliah  's Arms  To merit  Merab  's falsely promis'd Charms  HE next the Wonders of his  Sword  admir'd  When gayly bold by  Michal  's Beauty fir'd  Two Hundred Foreskins of the Foe he paid  A double Dow'ry for the Royal Maid  The Royal Maid the daring Youth approv'd  Met her new Lord and unreserv'd She lov'd  NOR yet was the relentless Father won  By the True Subject or the Duteous Son  The thirsted Blood still sought he to attain  By Fraud by Force but Fraud and Force were vain  The faithful  Michal  bad her Spouse depart  Mourn'd him as Sick with all the Woman's Art  But thro' a Window secretly convey'd  To seek at  Ramah  Holy  Samuel  's Aid  THENCE fled He the Devoted Life to save  Now to  Adullam  now  Engeddi  's Cave  To  Paran  's Desart or the  Ziphites  Wood  To Woods to Caves to Desarts SAUL pursu'd  TRUSTING a Foe before a Father's Wrath  He sought Protection in the Land of  Gath  Thro'  Nob  He thither past a fatal Guest  GOLIAH'S Sword and hallow'd Bread the Priest  Bounteous supply'd but for the wellmeant Aid  The Lives of fourscore Priests to  Saul  were paid  AT  Gath  Kind AKISH gave him  Zicklag  's Town  And well the Hero merited the Boon  Till SAUL at  Gilboa  fell and by his Side  The Prince the other Half of DAVID dy'd  Much He the Father mourn'd but more the Son  He lost a Scepter but the Friend was gone  AND now what Wars he wag'd what Labours bore  E'er  Israel  's Crown at Ease the  Monarch  wore  Employ'd his Thoughts while  Ishbosheth  in vain  Labour'd a Lineal Title to maintain  Murder'd he fell who ill aspir'd to rule  A Traitor's Victim and a Party's Tool  The hated Crime the Murd'rers Lives atone  And  David  mounts the uncontested Throne  AMAZING Toils but now the Toils were o'er  And banish'd Sorrow shou'd return no more  United  Israel  glory'd in his Reign  And Heav'n his Throne had promis'd to sustain  Had destin'd to a long Successive Race  Distinguish'd Glory and peculiar Grace  SION he sees by his Victorious Hand  The Seat of Worship and of Empire stand  The  Philistines  and  Amleck  dread his Sword  And vanquish'd EDOM owns him as her Lord  MOAB'S proud Sons a forc'd Submission bring  And SYRIA mourns in Blood the Rashness of her King  Before his Arms the Strength of  Ammon  falls  And haughty  Hanan  trembles in his Walls  Repents the Insult that his Pride return'd  The Friend provok'd and proffer'd Kindness scorn'd  FEAR'D by his Foes by his Allies caress'd  Lov'd by his GOD and by his People bless'd  Remain'd there ought to fear Or had there been  A Happier Prince among the Sons of Men  UNHAPPILY secure Untimely vain  Sincerer Ills and heavier Griefs remain  That Hour that Ease Thou boasts shall hurt Thee more  Than all the Injuries in Fortune's Pow'r  A  Frontier  Town which crowded Forces shield  Dares thus the gleamy Squadrons of the Field  Secure in Arms on the High Walls they shine  While the Foes labour in the secret Mine  Till pass'd the gloomy Vaults they rise to Air  Horribly dreadful in the proudest Square  NE'ER felt his Soul the sad Effects of Sin  For all was pure and all was calm within  Tumultuous Passion Lust Deceit Despair  And black Remorse had never harbour'd there  Nought fear'd He from Himself nor understood  David  was yet by  David  unsubdu'd  Now was the Hour illfated he must know  That vicious Pleasures terminate in Woe  URIAH  's Garden near the Palace laid  Where twining Trees a private Arbor made  Yet from aloft the piercing Eye might trace  With Ease the Secrets of the dark Recess  Hither a  Rivulet  was taught to glide  Whose constant Store a Marble Bath supply'd  And here to bathe about the SettingSun  The Lovely  Bathsheba  retir'd alone  Unconscious of a Witness She display'd  Luxuriant Beauty in the fraudful Shade  Survey'd each Charm that cou'd  Uriah  move  And wander'd o'er the Mystery of Love  Her comely Limbs the curling Stream embrac'd  And flow'd but Limpid flow'd around her Waste  To the King's View her Snowy Charms were bare  He saw Her naked and he own'd her  Fair  Fair She was wond'rous Fair  A Lot too great for any Subject's Bliss  Oh She was HEAV'N and oh that She were His  NOW through his Soul an Earnest Wish there fled  Of furtive Joys and an Adult'rous Bed  The Handsbreadth Cloud from whence the blackning Storm  Arose to wreck his Peace and all his Joys deform  NOR Rest nor Ease th' intruding Thought affords  Till He reveals the Secret to his LORDS  The Lords officious with a Courtly Care  Discharge the Message and address the Fair  In moving Terms the King's Desires convey'd  With too much Ease were those Desires obey'd  Soft Love invites and proud Ambition warms  Weak Woman yields and meets the Monarch's Arms  WHILE These in Love the flying Hours employ  Revel secure and give a Loose to Joy  Laugh at the Ign'rance of the injur'd Spouse  The violated Bed and cancell'd Vows  At  Rabbah  's Siege  Uriah  sought Applause  Lavishly valiant in his Country's Cause  Till the sad Wanton's News the King alarms  That She was pregnant by the Royal Arms  Now must He be to the false Bed beguil'd  Th' imagin'd Father of the spurious Child  For this dispatch'd a feign'd Express to bring  He leaves the Camp attends the Lustful King  Who wanted not Credulity to force  Artful Reception and prepar'd Discourse  Enquir'd the  Monarch  with design'd Address  The  Gen'rals  Welfare and the War's Success  Curious He seem'd each Circumstance to know  The Site the Strength the Number of the Foe  Receiv'd the Answers with majestick Pride  Forc'd a Kind Look and with a Smile reply'd  WELL hast Thou satisfy'd our Royal Care  Sure of our Favour to Thy House repair  Indulge the Pleasures of the  Court  awhile  A short Delay shall give Thee back to Toil  Let the rough Labours of the  Warrior  cease  And taste till then  soft  Love and  joyous  Ease  THESE I adjourn to  Peace  the CHIEF reply'd  Ill suit such Pleasures with a Martial Mind  The Feast luxurious and the flowing Bowl  Unstring the Sinews and debase the Soul  SAY shall Thy Soldier the fond Wife possess  And melt inglorious in the soft Caress  Or press the downy Bed in Silk inclos'd  While JUDAH sees Her  Ark  in Tents expos'd  And sheath'd in Arms the Youths of  Israel  dare  The gen'rous Hardships of the toilsome War  May HEAV'N so bless Thee as I disapprove  This  dull  Inaction and  unmanly  Love  TO Him the King Enough is giv'n to  Fame  At least a Night Domestick Sweets may claim  Till Morrow's Dawn Thy purpos'd Hast delay  And take Thy Journey with returning Day  HE said resolv'd the Mirthful Feast to prove  If ought might fire Him to the Joys of Love  At his own Table caus'd the CHIEF to dine  And the rich Goblet flow'd with gen'rous Wine  In vain the Feast was serv'd the Goblet flow'd  And all his Arts the wily King bestow'd  Stretch'd on the lonely Couch the Night he sped  Nor sought the Pleasures of the Nuptial Bed  He slept but Sleep the  Royal  Eyelids fled  Uriah  's Death the treach'rous King design'd  And the black Thought deep labour'd in his Mind  He rose the rash Resolve to JOAB wrote  Beneath whose Care His  Hosts  at  Rabbah  fought  To place Him where the surest Danger lay  In the sharp Conflict of the Doubtful Day  Strict He enjoin'd till by the Foes beset  Then to retire and leave Him to his Fate  The Royal  Signet  clos'd the dire Command  And safe consign'd it to  Uriah  's Hand  All heedless of the Murd'rous Charge he held  Early the Hero hasted to the Field  Took his last Orders with a joyous Mind  And rush'd impatient to the Post assign'd  He charg'd impetuous till he saw too late  The Foes surrounding and the Friends retreat  Yet dear resolv'd th' abandon'd Life to sell  Greatly he fought as Loyally he fell  And bless'd with the expiring Gasp of Life  Th'  ungrateful  Sovereign and the  faithless  Wife  THE Monarch heard the News with Artful Care  He blam'd the Sword unknowing how to spare  And undiscerning Chance of wasteful War  But now avow'd his Flame the Husband dead  And took the Widow to the Royal Bed  A Son She bore and for a transient Time  Inly he joy'd at the successful Crime  ABSURD Mankind when in the Ways of Ill  We for our Reason substitute our Will  Fondly secure and indolently gay  In the smooth Calm of flatt'ring Vice we play  Till o'er our Heads the Thunder bursting loud  Echoes tremendous and proclaims the GOD  THUS  David  found his Sanguine Hopes recede  And all the gaudy Dream of Pleasure fled  When NATHAN came a venerable Sage  In the grave Majesty of Hoary Age  Awful his Gesture and his Words sincere  Nor knew He ought to flatter or to fear  He bore his GOD'S Commission in his Look  Hail'd the vain King and thus the  Prophet  spoke  PLAINTIVE I come of Arbitrary Ill  The sad Encroachment of the Lawless Will  May  Israel  's King attend what I relate  And say what Vengeance meets a Crime so great  WITHIN Thy Realm a Man there dwelt of late  Bless'd with the Plenty of a vast Estate  So large his Herds that the increasing Breed  Black'ned the Vales and low'd in ev'ry Mead  And Flocks so num'rous were around him spread  That scarce He knew the Hills on which they fed  In the near Cottage liv'd a  Lab'ring  Hind  Of scanty Fortune but an Easy Mind  Nor Sorrow He nor Envy knew tho' poor  A Lamb was all his Joy and all his Store  This Darling Partner of his Board and Bed  With Care he nurs'd with fond Indulgence fed  Bred with his Children as a Child it far'd  Lov'd with a Parent's tenderest Regard  Mean while it chanc'd that to the Neighbouring Dome  An unexpected Visitant was come  The Lordly Master for his Friend's Repast  Nor from the Flock nor Herd selects the Feast  His own he spar'd the Little Fav'rite Ewe  The BosomComfort of the  Lab'rer  slew  Feasting remorseless on a  Neighbour  's Woe  SCARCE to the finish'd Tale the King suppress'd  The rising Fury of the Royal Breast  Incontinent He gave th' incens'd Reply  As the LORD lives the Man shall surely die  The fourfold Value of the Lamb return'd  For Force injurious and for Pity scorn'd  THE  Seer  stern Anger frowning on his Brow  Reply'd The Man whom Thou condemn'st art THOU  Ev'n  David  thus hath sinn'd and now prepare  The Sentence of an Angry GOD to hear  BY me He cites Thy Folly and Thy Pride  His Goodness slighted and his Pow'r defy'd  Ev'n Thee O King who durst that Pow'r disdain  Rais'd by my Favour from an abject Swain  I gave Thee Grace I gave Thee Strength in War  And made Thy Safety my peculiar Care  Lavishly bountiful I gave Thee All  The Wealth the Wives the Diadem of SAUL  Peace thro' Thy Land and smiling Plenty flow'd  Foes spake Thee  Great  while Subjects spoke Thee  Good  These Blessings why cou'd  Judah  's King destroy  For the short Transports of a guilty Joy  Bethink O King for what hast Thou resign'd  Thy Peace thy sweet Serenity of Mind  And Raptures which the Virtuous Soul bestow'd  Conscious of Worth and conversant with GOD  For the wild Cravings of the vicious Will  And false Appearance of a specious Ill  Pursu'd with Labour purchas'd with Deceit  Enjoy'd with Shame and finish'd with Regret  Nor end the Evils of the Crime therein  Lust's but the Threshold to the Gates of Sin  This well Thou know'st for Thou hast found it led  To the Invasion of the Nuptial Bed  The base Deception of the fraudful Word  And the Friend murder'd by the Hostile Sword  For  This  th' insatiate Sword with Endless Rage  Shall haunt Thine House and persecute Thine Age  For  This  Thy Wives estrang'd from  David  's Arms  Shall to Thy Neighbour's Bed transfer their Charms  Nor furtive shall like Thine their Joys be hid  The Noontide SUN shall view the flagrant Deed  ISRAEL th' Justice of her GOD shall know  Who makes th' offending Crime th' Offender's Woe  WHAT wild Amazement seiz'd the  Monarch  's Breast  When Vice appear'd in all her Shame confess'd  When now no more the glossy Varnish shone  The wretched  Mariner  conceives alone  Who far has sail'd and at his wish'd Return  Has thro' the Errors of a  misty  Morn  With eager Joy imagin'd Land pursu'd  But when the Splendor of the  Sun  renew'd  Has madly mourn'd the dear Delusion lost  And the  Ship  bulging on the Rocky Coast  HE wept his Folly and his Crime he own'd  Thy Death remitted and Thy Crime aton'd  Thy GOD declares the  Prophet  said the LORD  Slow to avenge as righteous to reward  Yet since by  This  Thou didst his Name expose  To the rude Licence of opprobrious Foes  Since Pleas for Vice the  Libertine  may bring  From this Excess of  Judah  's Fav'rite King  Die shall the  Child  of the  Adult'rous  Womb  Fix'd is his Fate and unrevers'd the Doom  THUS spake the  Seer  nor farther wou'd disclose  The destin'd Series of the  Monarch  's Woes  Tho' his Prophetick Soul in Time's dark Law  The Scene of Future Miseries foresaw  The Royal Offspring what black Crimes shou'd stain  A  Sister  ravish'd and a  Brother  slain  Rash  Amnon  's Death by  Absolom  decreed  For beauteous  Tamar  's violated Bed  And DAVID grieving at the impious Deed  How He the Slain and Fugitive shou'd mourn  Until the faithless  Absolom  return  Return accurs'd Ingratitude to show  And plunge him farther in the Depth of Woe  How forc'd o'er  Jordan  's Stream the Sire shou'd shun  The impious Arms of the Rebellious Son  Yet in the Anguish of a Father sad  With Ashes sprinkled and with Sackcloth clad  Shou'd grieve the Conquest that his Death must cost  And all the  Rebel  in the  Son  be lost  FARTHER He saw him destin'd to sustain  A deeper Anguish and a keener Pain  When summon'd by the unrelenting Seer  To the sad Choice of Famine Plague or War  How each dire Shaft from the Almighty's Bow  Shou'd pierce his Soul with the severest Woe  While gasping he surveys on ev'ry Side  The guiltless Thousands for the  Monarch  's Pride  OPPREST with Grief He saw his Hoary Age  By  Adonijah  's Plot and factious Rage  And ev'n in Death transmitted with his Crown  Invidious Vengeance on his  Fav'rite  Son  THESE He foresaw yet wisely these suppress'd  Safe in the close Recesses of his Breast  For HEAV'N in Pity to our State conceals  From Human View the Course of Future Ills  Reluctant else wou'd wretched Man essay  The Toilsome Journey of the Thorny Way  Inly the Fortunes of the King he mourn'd  Restrain'd the rising Grief and Home return'd  While  David  in th' expiring Child beheld  The sad Prediction of the  Seer  fulfill'd  Apart in Bitterness of Soul He sate  And his  Repentance  as his  Crime  was  great  Let us by his EXAMPLE warn'd beware  Of tempting Vice and shun the fatal Snare  Or by the Frailty of our Passions led  Atone with Sorrow for the loath'd Misdeed  On each Offence a sad Remembrance cast  And  mend  the FUTURE as we  mourn  the PAST  FINIS
