 CHARLES AND CHARLOTTE  VOL I  CHARLES AND CHARLOTTE  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  Heaven first taught Letters for some Wretches aid  POPE'S ELOISA  LONDON Printed for WILLIAM LANE LeadenhallStreet MDCCLXXVII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Countess of DERBY  MADAM  THE veneration I have for your Ladyship flows from contemplating the preserved purity of your  conjugal  character  encircled by a court whose general infidelity is sanctified by the licentious taste of the times  You obstinately persist in the Gothic endearments of Domestic Constancy though adorned with all those personal graces which provoke the impertinence of the most seducing solicitations and you have fortitude enough to prefer  family felicity  to the  etiquette  of an elopement or the  eclat  of a divorce  After such an acknowledgment Madam it sounds inconsistent to shield under your protection a series of misfortunes which arise principally from  family differences  This apparent objection to your Ladyship's patronage is however easily removed To  whom  can an unfortunate pair so properly apply for sympathy as to the virtuous and sympathizing CHARLES and CHARLOTTE are as singularly as pathetically  circumstanced Their distress is directed closely to the feeling heart they will meet many a scornful sarcasm from the pride of  pretended  virtue but from  real  innocence from the COUNTESS of DERBY they invite the recompence ofa Tear  I am Your LADYSHIP's most obliged and obedient servant THE AUTHOR  CHARLES AND CHARLOTTE  LETTER I CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  London  I LEFT your house this morning predetermined never to enter it again the shelter I have flown to promises me the utmost security do not therefore seek after me since I am obliged in the sorrow of my soul to tell you that I  should be compelled to refuse even the supplications of my beloved Charles should his vigilance detect my retreat May you be for ever happy and have the philosophy and prudence soon to forget the unfortunate  CHARLOTTE  PS  I trust this to the penny post to prevent its being traced Farewell  LETTER II CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  GOD of heaven Predetermined never to enter my house again And did the hitherto kind gentle affectionate Charlotte form such a resolution and has she had the heart to put it in practice Inhuman girl What am I to think of this I will instantly fly to all your acquaintance and never rest till I again have the fugitive Charlotte in the arms of the faithful  CHARLES  LETTER III  From the same to the same  I BEGAN my pursuit at five minutes past eleven in the morning and I continued it till within a quarter of twelve at night the cloth and dinner all that time remaining untouched upon the table for I sent your sister one way while I went another but the labour of both hath terminated in disappointment  I now catch up the pen involuntarily to write to you without knowing whither to send my letter  and though convinced of this I continue to write on My heart is full and I must discharge some part of its load upon paper surely your residence will not long be a secret and then I will send it to you  Soft a little'Tis the dead of the night and the least alarm is heard distinctly In the moment of expectation the soul sits in the ear and listens to the approaches of her objectThe sound of a coach wheel rolls remotely May it bring onward the treasure I have lost  Flattering fond imagination The vehicle has past my door and 'twas  in vain I threw up the sash of the window to wait its stopping  Why Charlotte do you treat me thus Ungrateful girl I will retire into my chamber and think no more about you  CHARLES  LETTER IV  From the same to the same  ACCURSED is the gift of sensibility 'Tis the smart that "agonizes at every pore" Ever wretched shall the lover be in proportion to the fineness of his feelings  How little to be desired is delicacy of passion The higher degrees of tenderness are distracting and if the agitation I am now in should continue long with what fervency of supplication should I pray for stoicism or apathy or any other power that deadens the enervating softness of recollection  I rise from my bed to pen this ejaculation before the dawn of the day Ah barbarous Charlotte what a night have I laboured through I had resolved to think of you no more but my heart unfaithful to its resolutions will admit no other ideas but those which are connected with love and Charlotte Instantly sprang  the tear to my eye as I entered the solitary chamber the late scenes of serenity and interchanged endearment were now altered on the sudden to every thing that is dreary every thing that is desolate unpressed was the pillow which but the night before administered the balm of softness to the cheek of beauty and I found something to awaken a distressful feeling in every object that the taper exhibited to my viewThe toilet was not trusted with its suspended ornamentsthe chair was unoccupied which used to sustain your daydressbut the night robes were hanging idly and full in view at the side of the bed there was nobody to take them  downnobody to wear them Their mistress had deserted them I tost about for an hour and fretted myself into fatigue an unquiet slumber suceeded only to torture fancy by presenting you to me in dreams  She gave you to me in colours the most glowing attitudes the most atttacting and situations impossible to be born I yielded to the pleasures of imagination caught her dear figure in my arms and imprinted upon it the visionary kiss What was my astonishmentwhat my anguish when I awaked to the deception If the post of the morning does not bring me intelligence or if affection does not prevail with you  to come yourselfah thou fair returning fugitive I shall either lose my senses or have  reason  left only to hope for its departure  Farewell  LETTER V  From the same to the same  THE breakfast table has been covered and uncovered without the tea being made or any thing eaten and it is near twelve o'clock  Polly your sister has examined your trunks and drawers out of  which she says nothing is missing and it seems you are gone without either cloaths or money How shall I interpret this Dreadful images rise before me and yetit cannot beyou have no cause Since the day that we met I have affectionately anticipated every wish and to the utmost of my power protected you from every careselfdestruction No no that can never be you have too aweful a sense of deityof dutyand you have no temptation to rob the world and me of an individual so inestimablethe more I think the deeper do I dive into perplexities I will throw away the pen and think no more You do not imagine the peace of my soul  worth a single slip of paper or one stroke of the pen Farewell  You have injured CHARLES  LETTER VI CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  SOMETHING is due I forsee to the alleviation of that anxiety which my absence will throw you into I am therefore hence induced to tell you that I am well and happy and upon your solemn engagement of promise never to come in person will transmit to you my address  where I shall think myself honoured by your  correspondence  the only connexion that can for the future take place betwixt Charles and  CHARLOTTE  LETTER VII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  BARBAROUS as is the inhibition I solemnly comply with it and desire to have your address immediately forwarded to the forsaken  CHARLES  LETTER VIII CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  RECEIVE inclosed what you request and God bless you  Adieu CHARLOTTE  LETTER IX CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  I Send agreeable to your given direction the packet I had written at different times since your departure but I am too ill to add more to it than the now forgotten name of  CHARLES  LETTER X CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  I Received your packet every sentence of which was calculated to afflict meah forbear my beloved Charlesforbear to charm me into a relapse you accuse me of barbarity when you ought to encourage me in virtue I have made a sacrifice my dear friendlate as it is I have made a sacrifice to devotion and to duty That I may not however suffer any longer the imputation of cruelty I will frankly reveal to you the motivethe only motive that could prevail with me to quit the society of Charles  To tell you the whole matter in a single sentenceI have seen a person who hath a greater right to Charles than CharlotteI have seenyour wife Ah sir what an interview unprepared for the scene how could I sustain it I sunk under it and your lady triumphed in all the dignity of privilege and advantages of argumentSurely heaven threw her in my way to shew me in blushing colours to her and to myself We had never met before and as the meeting was delayed for more than four years it was by so much the more aweful and insupportable Yet do not blame her Charles Whatever may have been your disagreements and however multiplied the  causes that led originally to your disunion she hath still the right of a married woman and deserves to be heard Nor can I complain of her conduct even upon so trying an occasionshe did not insult she did not execrate but pursuing a much nearer way to the heart she appealed from my passions to my sense of justice and from my tenderness to my truth Oh Charles Charles her pleadings were too pathetic to be resistedI took her hand and bathed it with my tears and she followed the advantage she had gained till she obtained that promise which I have at length had the fortitude to perform  Severe I confess to yousevere even to the verge of distraction has been the  conflict  Long I hesitated long I remained undetermined and even at last I have been compelled rather to stifle the rising emotions of tenderness precipitately than act upon the calm principles of deliberationYet I have now been almost a week absent and am alive though there is a stand of coaches opposite my window any one of which would carry me to the only man I love upon earth I have had the courage to see them drive off and return without filling a place in any one of them myself  No longer therefore accuse a behaviour that challenges your admiration even while it afflicts you My trunk you may if you please forward to my apartment and my sister who being ignorant of our real situation had better be still kept so I would recommend you to send home to her mother in the country where the news neither of our separation nor its motive may ever arrive Be this as it may return to you again I never can and indeed to shew you the impossibility of it I have paid a voluntary visit to Cleora your lawful lady to assure her we are parted for ever Nothing therefore remains but that you endeavour to emulate  till you surpass the heroism of the determined  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE After receiving the foregoing  IN the agony of my heart I have equity enough to praise your heroism though it is dashed with a romance that ascends to the very summit of enthusiasm I now see my fate and the continuance of the misery that attends it  The claims of the wife the lawful lady and the married woman are all I see dancing their fascinations before thee  Think not Charlotte I laugh at laws or ridicule institutions held sacred and obligatory Dear girl I do not laugh at them but in my particular case and in others similar to mine an ample apology is found in the dictates of nature reason and common sense I will not nor indeed am I yet calm enough to ramble into the detail of original grievancesthose grievances which produced a separation from the wife of the law who hath now separated the wife of the soul Suffice it to  say it was a rash marriage and soon repented on both sides the bitterness of conjugal repentance is beyond every other poignant and happy is it if  disunion  rather than perpetuated  disagreement  results from it Is this sophistry Is this casuistry no Charlotte it is simple didactic argument ratified by unprejudiced reason and stampt with the sanction of unbigotted senseI feel as nicely as yourself the force of virtue and the elegant triumphs of unspotted character but I see no reason why those who upon the evidence of more than two years experience are unsuited to each other "join'd not match'd" should live janglingly together merely to pull the tight cord of a connexion  at different ends and exist miserably under the same roof for the meagre satisfaction of having it to say we fight it out friendly without parting  Egregious folly and superstition and slavery in their extremes you know the whole matter my situation has been often delineated to you and I will only desire you to reflect attentively upon it before I obey your cruel request in relation to your trunk Ah Charlotte how can I bear to see those several ornaments purchased by my own hand in the ostentatious fondness of shewing you to the admiring public as the property of your constant protector  how can I bear to see these depart into any other dressingroom but that which belongs to you and in which they are now waiting the return of her who honours them in the wearing My dear dear companion it must not be the laws of love and life and reciprocated conjunction of hearts and minds forbid it Think betteroh think better of itthrow aside the rigour of those resolutions which can produce no good and admit those receiv'd ideas which will soften this unnecessary severity and direct you to the sighing bosom and open arms of  CHARLES  LETTER XIII CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  YOU  do  sophisticate Charles and you are a casuist Deny it not Your wife is a fine woman and you ought to love her she is chaste and you ought to live with her But live with her or not I have done my duty and though it should shorten my life I will still persevere and fly the open arms of the late beloved Charles as sedulously as if they were filled with poison  CHARLOTTE  P S  If you refuse to send the trunk make a compliment of it to my sister I can do without it  LETTER XIV CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  MADAM  I ASK your pardon for detaining any part of your property after it was so peremptorily demanded I have however now though late made restitution of every thing which either your sister's industry or mine could find about your apartmentsI have seen madam the trunk containing your dresses and decorations carried upon the shoulders of a porter coffin like and had it been  indeed  your coffin my despair would have been only one degree superior Heavy as it is  with what a joy should I have stooped to the burden and been myself the messenger while the insensible athletic animal who is now such will be intent only upon the profits of his message and view only with a vulgar amazement the form of the fair tyrant who rejects her conquest and and yet holds in chains her captive  Your concluding sentiment enters a caveat against further argument and shortens my letter It is not I perceive the force of virtuous principles drives you from me only but the poison of aversion you have conceived for those open arms to which you were so tenderly though I confess so officiously invited Fear not I  beseech you madam the shortness of your life upon my account it is in no danger from that quarter and I do not doubt but your health and spirits will continue to encrease in proportion to the length of your absence  The point is plain enough and I am sorry your delicacy and ingenuity have been put to such a strait for an expedient How extremely  ápropos  was your interview with Cleora and how sincerely do I congratulate you upon the lucky crisis in which it has united inclination and duty I perceive they have gone in this affair like friends well but unexpectedly met hand in hand together Four  years possession is I must own enough to  poison  any body and it is only for such constant fools as Charles to increase his passion by gratifying it I again beg your pardon and promise to trespass no more upon that time which you are no doubt employing in more agreeable engagements than reading the letters of a  cast  lover perhaps the present hour is enlivened by the charms of a new acquaintance and it may be in the delirium of female vivacity upon the dear subject of liberty restoredthat  paradise regained  to the soul of a woman the name I say and infirmity of the neglected Charles may give additional zest to sprightliness and enhance the  entertainment of a delicious  têteátête  The victor I must own hath a right to imitate the barbarism of Achilles and draw at the tail of his chariot the corpse of conquest At this I shall not pretend to cavil 'Tis the prescriptive right of the tyrant and the slave must submit But if there exists any  man  in the creation hardy enough to  partake  your conquest and to express the impudence of exultation over itif such a one there is madam let  him  tremblefor nothing but his life shall pacify my heart or atone for the sport he has made of my weakness or my sensibility  CHARLES  LETTER XV CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  NOW indeed Sir you have nobly exerted yourself and I ought to express to you my thanks for taking the only method that could make me forget you Were I not inexcusably weak I  should  do this but I own you have wounded me I own that your several sarcasms have gone where you directed theminto the recesses of my heart Most ungenerous Charles to interpret that action into the most mercenary meanness which I summon the great God that inspired it to witness proceeded from principle  No Sir my spirits and health if I may judge of the future by the present are  not  likely to be restored to me in proportion to the length of my absence nor was the abruptness of my departure the effort of so much ingenuity as you may be pleased to imagine  If you are yet capable of doing justice I desire you to reflect on the various struggles I have at different times had since the commencement of our connection upon the point that now carried me for ever from you Even before I saw the lawful Cleora I shed many a tear and heaved many a sigh at the thought of that injury I was every hour  committing against her Nay did I not twice before even in the warmest transports of our tenderness bring myself to the resolution of leaving you You pursued persuaded pre+vailed and brought me back to guilty pleasures Seeing the life of Charles bound up in the society of Charlotte I endeavoured again to reconcile myself to my situation I even adopted in some degree the sophistry of your own sentiments I argued as an apology the innocence of my intention the hearty desire I had to serve your family the gratitude I owe to the man who improved my understanding and adorned my manners and in short I took refuge in a thousand plausibilities  rather than be torn on the rack of reflection and leave a society so inexpressibly dear to me  Auspicious to the scheme of forgetfulness it was about this time you know Sir that we began our excursions and took the different tours of England Ireland and Scotland The improvements I made in the course of these journies the serenity of the seasons in which they were for the most part performed and the attracting benefits of so ingenious a companion as Charles suspended for a while the kneener sense of an illicit connection Yet in the very bosom of bliss I was never so dull as not to know that it  was  an illicit one and therefore proper to be broken To break it nevertheless was far beyond the feebleness of my power The idea of Charles and all his fascinating qualities mixt with every image and made the leading feature of every figure that was formed by the soul In repugnance to the conduct I ought to have pursued I called to my aid all the seductions of imagination and when  they  failed I derived the comforts of selfdelusion even from the pictures of truthIs he not said I industrious to justify my error while I soothed my passion is he not the man who took me up in a more than orphan state and proved himself to me a father and a friend  Did he not find me a ruined creaturea poor unfortunate wanderer who had been just deserted by the villain lord who taking advantage of simplicity had robbed my innocence and turned me unprovided upon the world Ought I not to bless the accident then that threw me in the way of this affectionate protector From what irremediable misery may he not have saved me How indefatigable has been his tenderness How assiduous his efforts to support me How anxious and unremitting his wishes and labours to place me in a way of supporting myself against that day in which he might want life to exert himself Was not this my first preceptor  Wanting the attentions of a parent and an early victim to my credulity did he not find me stepping into the very border of female violation Was not our first interview in the very momentous crisis of a woman's fate and was I not weeping in the bitter sincerity of my heart over the prospects of destruction  Surrounded by calamities like these did not providence direct Charles to save me as the guardian angel of an unhappy girl and has not this very Charles preserved his friendship unbroken and his fidelity consummate ever since the day of my deliverance  Arguments like these strongly seconded by the feelings of my heart did I frequently exert till cooperating with the refinements of your conversation and the charm I never failed to find in your entertaining company I had almost brought myself to believe there was nothing extremely wrong in our intercourse  Lulled however by this pleasing lethargy of the senses and sung to repose by the syren of tenderness I argued myself into a transient serenity and indulged the softness which I perceived to be so soothing We compleated our designs and returned from our rambles in the  English nation and its neighbouring countries in order to visit together the continent of France Preparations you know Sir were making for our  route  soon after our arrival in London and the beginning of the next week was fixed for our departure  In the interim I met with the injured Cleora who told me in the most affecting manner that though she never wished a reunion with you it would give that peace to her heart which was long lost if I would tear myself from your embraces Agonized by her pleadings and stung by the sense of having wronged her I fell upon my knee and solemnly in that situation  engaged  to do what I  have  done  I have nothing to do with your family differences Charles nor shall I listen to the story of either party Duty and conscience are both concerned in the measure I have taken and I shall not be made to repent of it even by the severity of your upbraidings It was nevertheless too much descending from the native dignity of your dispositiontoo unlike the candour of Charles's character to suppose a connection of four years establishment every day of which produced some evidence of its sincerity should be sacrificed to the very grossest purposes in the first week's separation A new acquaintance What would you insinuate To what indelicacy do you allude I  have a tear now falling upon that part of your letter and I wish it had the power to blot both the sentiment and the recollection of it out of my memory for ever With great reluctancy shall I admit any ideas that disgrace the elegance of Charles's sensibility Though duty commands me to quit his protection my knowledge of his many eminent virtues incline me to cherish his idea and still love him for his excellencies I would most gladly consider him as a friend a correspondent and a conspicuous character and though we shall never meet again the sense of my obligations to him and his own merits might be a constant source of innocent contemplation to me  why Charles will you rob me of so agreeable a refuge perhaps the greatest the whole world has now to afford me Do you think Sir then that I can so soon make a transfer of my affections can I think you in so very short a space of time  command  them from Charles to any accidental object have I so convenient a heart so obedient a versality what do you take me for but indeed I deserve it all she who can bring herself to sleep upon an unsanctified pillow four long twelve months may well be supposed to perpetrate any thing that is wrong and therefore I forgive you although in justice to myself I must observe how I shudder and how the blood runs from my  heart at the bare suggestion of such perfidy  Indeed you wrong me and I cannot bear you to entertain such ideas even though by entertaining them yourself  my  image would be the sooner obliviated Though you found me a fallen woman I am not constitutionally a wretch of purchase Sir Your many amiable lessons of morality have not been so egregiously misemployed The virtue you have inculcated and the volumes you have put into my hand have produced effects more salutary nay Charles it is to your own instructions to your own cultivation of my head and heart that I have been induced to  undertake the magnanimity of this action With respect to resources such I mean as are necessary merely necessary to the preservation of human life it is impossible that I should be destitute of them while I have health and the power who encouraged me to a good action will not I trust suffer the sharpness of poverty to result from it But even if he should I shall eat no longer the bitter bread of adultery and considering that punishment proportioned to the offence shall kiss the omnipotent rod without complaining and supplicate the aids of penitence and patience till my sentence is softened and the punishment remitted  For the support of life I have no doubt but that industry will enable me to get a sufficiency You Charles have not suffered me to lead a life of idleness I am skilled in the elegant labours of the needle I can embroider I have some little knowledge of those employments which may assist me from applying to the milliners nay andsuch has been the effect of your instructionsI am not incapable of undertaking the elementary principles of female education Here indeed Charles I feel a severe stroke from reflection Who will put any children under the care of a free woman what parent will trust its rising hopes to one who has herself failedhow long alas will it  be before the world can be convinced of my penitence or my propriety let this be as it will my resolution remains firm as at the first and Charles must be eternally disunited from  CHARLOTTE  P S  I received the trunk and thank you for your care  Farewell  LETTER XVI CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  Too amiable CHARLOTTE  WHEREFORE do you thus officiously labour to extort my approbation and wherefore have you not left it in my power to censure you were there any hard part in your characterhad you charitably left me but one single cruelty on which I might have founded a reasonable complaint so that I might have ruminated upon it till I had argued myself into aversion it might  have been more tolerable but you are obstinately bent upon murdering me by your goodness and every moment increase the admiration which I ought to feel daily diminishing The laws of the land and the prescriptions of custom have thrown the arguments so abundantly on your side that 'tis impossible to baffle them without seeming to sophisticate Fool and idiot that I was to run into the shackle that galls for life and to bind it like a volunteer slave on my own leg and yet Charlotte you have assisted Cleora in acting contradictions Does she not by her own confession militate against a reunion does she not declare the misery of which she foresees it would be productive  to what end thento what end but the most cruel and unnecessary one should she wish to effect a separation between Charles and Charlotte Cleora and Charles entertain not for each other either hatred or love indifference is the point between them And what virtuous purpose is likely to arise from the parting in which she has been instrumental  But you are I see too immersed in established ideas and the customs of a country to admit a single exception to a general rule although a minute's reflection would convince you that  my  case and  yours  are such  as should be absolutely set apart from almost every other  Ah inflexible Charlotte wherefore have you shielded your heart from the dear arrows of love under the bulwark of such venerable maximsmaxims which be their general tenor ever so admirable must always allow deviation in certain cases How easy were it to prove that in strict speaking it would be absurd and irrational even to unite again with Cleora Nay to put our of the question every other plea and rely only on the energy of a single argument the argument of our mutual  indifference  is it not demonstrably ridiculous to live a loveless  life with any being Peculiar circumstances of temporal distress at the first occasioned my leaving Cleora I left her with a heart utterly at liberty and in situations in no degree worse than before I heartily invited and hastily obtained her hand Chance or rather surely the contrivance of some pitying deity soon afterwards presented before my eye the image of Charlotte Every thing in human nature that corresponds with the pathetic united to favour our first interview It was in the still hour of midnight 'twas in the hour of misfortune We were both sufferers I mourned the barbarity of a mother embarrassed affairs and anxieties at home you  were sinking under the sense of an equal injury Social sorrows soon suit themselves to the soul and the impression that is made in such a crisis is deep and delicate indeed  I see methinks the first scene and I feel what language and sentiment denies the power to describe Ah CharlotteThink a little upon itPrepare for a Picture so particularly interesting Invoke the powers of imagination fidelity and fondness to do it justiceLay aside every formal every unnecessary punctilio and give upon so important an occasion a full scope to the tenderness of natureThat tenderness my dear which was bestowed by the  great God of kindness to  make the nauseous draught of life go down  I have in preparing you for such a portrait inspired myself The subject is not to be withstoodI dedicate it Charlotte to your sensibility I address it to your Heart Did I in the first Scene insult you Did I insult you with any offer that could distress or confuse you No Charlotte some secret impulse it was that withheld me from the deed some god it was which inclined me to be inquisitively exact in drawing from you the history of your unhappiness The tale was told with a simplicity and bewitching artlessness that might have gained credit from  infidelity and attracted attention from frolic Let the tears that I then shed let the kindness with which I have since cherished you witness the truth of my tenderness and protection How were we both affected how did our sympathy incline us to approach till our cheeks were as the reposing yet glowing cushions of each other's Can you forget the trembling throbs that you felt as I pressed your making hand upon my bosomI withdrew till you undrest and I appeal to you if I did not sit like the nurse of your chamber by the side of your bed till morning I found it absolutely impracticable to treat your misery in any other manner even your beauty dazzling as  it was and in the most trying of all situations was not able to betray me I paid my court to your heart to your situationto your pathetic circumstances and to every thing but your person the charms of which resplendent as I acknowledge they were I had no leisure to reflect upon till I had in some measure soothed the mighty anguish under which you were struggling  I proposed a retreat in the recesses of the country Such a retreat Charlotte my vigilant affection ever wakeful ever indefatigable soon provided and when I had smoothed your own situation and related to you in the undisguise of my soul the  particulars of mine I then ventured and not  till  then to mention the wishes which after all the little delaying reluctances that endear ultimate consent were successful  Tell not me Charlotte of the prude's unfeeling formality Do not suggest to me the sneer which outrageous virtue would cast upon such a transaction Spirits I know there are terribly holy and formidably devoutpunctilious as to the minutiae of ceremonials and negligent of essentials which would ridicule the delaying reluctances of Charlotte as artful pretences Whatsay they piously violentshall  she  who ascends the  nuptial  couch to supply unlawfully  the place of the lawfulto fill the arms that are awefully  preoccupied  who hath moreover forfeited her innocence to the seducer and been reduced to irreputable refuges shall  she  assume the character of chastity and all its coynesses or indeed any of those marks of amiableness which ought to distinguish only married modesty and maiden decorum Fie upon her  Ah hard of heart and shallow of head illiberal contracted women Is it not possible for virtue to  be  independent of forms is it not possible in a case like Charlotte's for the most unspotted purity of mind to survive an accidental violation of  personBut then you reply she lived after all publicly with the husband of another woman In any other exigence but her's and mine it might be impossible to offer a plea of palliation  Let wealth and honour wait the wedded dame  August her deed and sacred be her fame  Far be it from me far from the most unhappy Charles be it to blast the laurels or wither the roses of conjugal life 'Twere impious 'twere impracticable I am not audacious enough to say with Eloisa  Curse on all laws but those which love has made  Ah gracious gracious heaven that it had been permitted to blend in  our  connection the laws of love and of the land natural with moral institutions May never any pair Charlotte who love as  we  love be reduced by the tyranny of their situation to equal measures may those whose hearts are equally tuned by  nature  into equal sympathy find a friend in  fortune  to facilitate their union Happyeminently happy they who are thus assisted and whose joys receive in conformity to the custom of nations  their imprimatur of tenderness and possession at the  altar    Our fates Charlotte were unfortunately peculiar and our resolution to run them together was natural and set off as they were by ten thousand delicacies irresistable Let not our conduct be proposed as an example to be adopted where it is even possible for man and wife to live together but let not our fidelity after we  had  united be censured too vigourously or too incautiously  Weigh these facts well and they will tempt you to seek again your  long accustomed pillow upon the bosom the heart under which will swell to welcome your return of  CHARLES  LETTER XVII CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  HOW often must I repeat how often waft it on the wings of the post that I must never more repose on the bosom of Charles Cease cease then ah my dear seducer for pity's sake Do not continue to croud upon me those images which it is pernicious to entertain Whereforeoh thou ungenerous wherefore do you oppose the most omnipotent of all human arguments wherefore do you oppose  yourself  betwixt the severely contending powers  of duty and passionAh inhuman it is not without exertions the most violent and pangs the most accumulated that I am able to sustain the conduct I have for the last four days observed Conscious as you are of the  propriety  of that conduct forbear I solemnly conjure you to address my partiality again upon the only subject which it cannot safely contemplate  The sketch you have delineated of our intercourse in its first dear but unfortunate beginnings is too boldly coloured and bears too visibly the delicate touches of a master for the eye of one who can trace so lively a likeness betwixt the copy and the  original If then you have any regard to the peace of my mindany to my prosperitynever present to my view again so animated or so dangerous a picture rather I beseech you turn that most powerful pen of yours into a chaster style indulge it in the display of subjects more suited to our circumstances Direct your fine but too persuasive genius into the proper channel and let the strength and vigour of Charles's understanding rather prevent than debilitate the infirmity of Charlotte's and besides this how unfair is it to avail yourself of that very feeling in your favour which your reason tells you it is inequitable to indulge  The copious effusion of tender tears that flowed as I suppose you cruelly intended they should in obedience to the commanding sentiments of your last have a little relieved my heart at the expence of exhausting my spirits  I have acquired once more sufficient composure to write to the man who seems resolved to keep me in constant agitation  You  did  save me Charles from distress the most agonizing from a state the most dreadful you  did  unite in your character all the relations as a father instructedas a mother admonishedas a brother protected  as a sister entertained and as a husband cherished Oh Charles Charles it is all well all great all a noble climax till we get to the last expression It was only  as  a husband it was  like  one that you cherished me 'Twas out of your poweroh the malice of fortuneto  be  one and as that was the case we should not have united I should have found that generosity in your  friendship  which you ought to have denied me in your  tenderness  I might have been the object of your  benevolence  without I write the sentence with a blush burning my cheekwithout sharing your bed How would it have redounded to the honour of my Charles how officiously would the daughters  of distress have trusted his fame to the echo of posterity if his bounty had been totally unaccompanied by guilt if he had rescued an unhappy girl from misery without bringing her out of one error to lead her into another  Methinks I now see how Charles might at once have procured my honour and my happiness and I who know the goodness of his heart wonder the scheme or something similar to it escaped him Might he not have placed the unhappy female far from the delusions of the metropolis in some sheltering part of the country where the knowledge of her calamity might never arrive  There might she not under the protection of some decent matron have learned all the arts of useful life even till the often transmitted bounty of her absent friend Charles might be no longer necessary to her subsistance What room had here been for probationwhat scope for innocence recovered and what immortalitywhat undescribeable sensations must have attended an action so disinterested so unmixtso admirable Instead of which but I cannot I ought not to upbraid you I acknowledge the delicacy of your deportment when it was the most essential and when very very few would have therefore bestowed it But let us drop the subject assist me  not treacherously to the recollection of scenes which I wish and ought to forget Surely surely it is not now a time to receive them in the memory Ah Charles why did not heaven allow our first meeting to have preceded your union with Cleora then with what a transport a transport sanctified by religion should Ibut it is unavailing to wish we are parted eternally nor can even such an epistle as your last adorned as it is with all the glowing graces of language and artfully addressed to every passion that alarms the sex make me revolt from that steady principle I have fixt to myself in the deliberation of my soul as the rule of my future conduct If  therefore you set any price upon the pleasures of our continued correspondencefor I will forfeit even your letters rather than read myself into a relapselet this ultimate this repeated assurance satisfy you once for all In a word Charles let it teach your heart to be contented with a gratification somewhat less terrible than that which would terminate in the perdition of the afflicted but alas still  affectionate CHARLOTTE  P S  You do not mention my sister but you certainly have sent her to the arms of an innocent and expecting mother whose want of knowledge  in my case is perhaps the only thing that prevents bringing her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  Adieu  LETTER XVIII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  INVULNERABLE and unrelenting as you are I have the right of a painter to finish my picture Hard would it indeed be were I denied so trifling a liberty as that which the pen allows when I obey your too rigid injunctions in keeping from the apartment which I know to  contain my treasure Think madam oh that cold wordthink Charlotte of the severe restraint I impose upon myself I know the very house in which you sleepif you indeed  can  sleepand yet I desist from going to make enquiries in which I am so much interested  And are you alarmed by the faintly drawn sketch of our first week's connexion Alas how very poor how very unequal was all which  then  past when compared to the months and years that succeeded it a dew drop to the deep and main world of waters Carry your imagination in retrospect to the time when we first yielded to the exigence and agreed  to live in the same house when in all tender respects we agreed to consider ourselves asunited people Look back to the very night ever precious to lovesick remembrance when you first indulged the solicited embrace Till after the attention of many days I did not dare to intimate the hopes of a conquered heart nor even at last till I had reconciled you to every part of my hapless situationtill we had both lamented the bar that prevented a public sanction Paint to your fancy the joy that was then realized when you first permitted me half consenting half denying to draw the curtain betwixt us and every interruption I can say no more I refer you to the powers of  imaginationIt was not the  unsoul'd  debauch of a dissipated pair it was not the delirium of two young people sedulous to snatch the hasty revels of a night's voluptuousness but it was the unaffected transport of sentiment and taste of body and mind consolidated not a vein in our hearts that did not thrill to the emotions of sympathy animated by the fire of real love not a pulse about us that did not leap to salute its hindred pulsation Remember above all things our next morning meeting at breakfast the sighs which we then wafted over the teacup the tears which were scarce contained within their sluices of crystal the various flushings of the countenance  and our aukwardenough endeavours to conceal the confusion which was thus rendered the more apparent all gave silent but delicious testimony that the mutual approbation was compleat  Perhaps you will say that this might be the energy of juvenile desire the mere enthusiastic riot of the agitated sensesthe transient fever of inflamatory spirits How easy were it in opposition to this to prove its origin from a more pure and permanent source Reflect I prithee fair fugitive on the scenes which succeeded Consider what diversity of events happened  after  to cool the blood and settle the senses Examine the train of misfortunes  which arose rapidly one out of another Did not my whole patrimony and all my hopes of elevated circumstances sink suddenly before me did not the hardened creditor then take his advantage of my calamity and hunt me with a bloodhound industry from to place was not my health invaded in consequence of my anxiety and were we not both reduced to uncertain resources was not this aggregate of affliction enough to quiet the impetuosity of mere animal inclination surely it was but they only rendered  us  still dearer to one another the burdens were heavy and each was therefore emulous to carry the greatest load of them we had even a sort of jealousy  lest the one should encroach upon the share of the other Tenderness and transport presided over our very difficultiesAh how often in the desolate moment when the whole hemisphere of hope was clouded have we watched the fall of the tear upon the cheek and kist it away how frequently have we caught the sigh while parting from the lips great woes we reconciled into sentiments of moderation and every gale of good fortune from whatever corner of her compass it blew was swelled by love into enchantment the beauty of a flower the paint of a tulip the fragrance of a rose the sudden lustre of the sun an evening walk or the morning prospect  over our breakfast painted by the gay pencil of imagination were more than a match for the empty purse the illnatured accident or miseries of the greatest magnitude And can those who have gone for the service of each other through the fiery trial ever forget ever ultimately separate Of all paradoxes it is to me the most irreconcilable  I conjure you then by the memory of our past misfortunes than which even the recollection of extacies is not more endearingI conjure you by the memory of our pleasures of which we have had our proportion I conjure you by the wishes you cherish for my health by the many  miseries of a situation that calls aloud for constant attentions in short Charlotte I conjure implore and challenge you by all that you hope and all which you dread to suffer me to enforce the pleadings of my heart at  your own lodgings  I will obey every injunctionah thou delightful tyrantimposed upon me the click of the clock shall bring me to the moment of your assignation I shall enter your apartment with all the tremors of a lover and yet I will not till you permit me speak of love I will anticipate the commands of your tongue and watch the time to depart from the waving of your finger the nod of your head or the turn of your eyeMore than  than the power of a sultaness shall attend you in this interviewOnly admit me onceto tea to breakfast to dine to sup I cannot CharlotteI swear by the heart you have carried forcibly away from me I cannot any longer support your absence Do not then hurry me into violence but indulge for this once my passion and trust to my prudence and my promises Farewell farewell  CHARLES  LETTER XIX CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  IS this your solemn engagement pressing for an interview already To what end do you think I left you Sir Was it to give myself a few days unnecessary agony to involve you in needless calamity and then to repent upon my folly and return again to the errors I have left I am angry that you think me guilty of so much inconsistency What a child must you believe me and yet how do you oblige me to be even with you For shame Sir for shame you want the philosophy of  an infant You have devoted several of the years of your youth to the study of the sciences you are deeply read in virtuous compositions and yet you are more feeble than the babe  To be outdone in a good action by a woman by the very woman whose undemanding and heart have been as it were the work of your own hands whom you have made what she is To let  her  surpass you in fortitude Blush blush and rise into the ambition of excelling her  From the very arguments that you draw as motives of my return  I can extract the most forcible reasons for my desisting from a reunion even supposing that there was no personal criminality attending it  Wherefore should I hang as a clog at the foot of a man already oppressed by the heavy hand of calamity whatever you may think it is no real testimony of regard to share your miseries without being able to relieve them To behold you struggling with your fate without the power to better it and rather adding  to  than taking  from  your embarrassments No Charles trust me we can both do more tolerably alone at least for the present in the course of a little time fortune  may be generous to one of us  which  is a point of no moment our persons only and not our purses are divided it will be the same thing whether the shower of prosperity falls upon Charles or Charlotte I hope neither of us shall at any time be capable of separate interests and that neither of us shall be too proud to receive assistance at the hand of the other As to your part your talents will recommend you  wheresoever  or  howsoever  you exert them and you cannot long fail of conquering the inconveniences which at present surround you Charlotte's society however dear was rather an impediment than any thing else to Charles's advancement and he will now be  admitted into connections which were before impenetrable We may amuse ourselves my dear friend with the idea of despising the customs of our country and the forms of our church nay we may attempt to soothe ourselves with the opinions of ourselves and a narrow circle of our private friends but if the voice of the public and the established modes of religion are against us it will be in vain that we receive a  partial  approbation It is not only politic but morally just that the general clamour should be raised against a couple in our situation The disagreements that pass under a man's own roof and the quarrels or feuds which divide the husband from  the wife do not authorize an open defiance of either the laws of man or the commands of God nor will the world however proper the separation ever enter into the intricacies of circumstance or pathetic of passion that throws the divided husband into the arms of another woman I am still willing to hope Charles that our offence will be mitigated by the God of mercy upon account of the many peculiar temptations and exigences that belonged to it in strict speaking perhaps there may not be any greater degree of guilt in our late connection than if it had immediately succeeded a divorce from your Cleora but when I am appealed to by a pleading wife  who charges me with seducing the the affections of a husband when I am branded by that wife as the artful and infamous cause of her child's misery and her own amongst all her friends and acquaintances when I am held up as the terror of married women at the very time that I know I would have at any time yielded the society of Charles to to more lawful claims how do you think I can bear to live under this load of halfmerited ignominy and halfundeserved reproach the truth will break like the sun through all disguising interceptions the delicacy of your passion for me Charles led you to conceal the fact in regard to my real situation Wherever you  went the brilliance of your wit and the polish of your genius together with the public evidences you have given of it attracted notice ensured popularity and commanded curiosityYou took me by the hand and presented me in all our excursions as your  wedded wife  I did my best to support the character I would have given worlds to have realized it but even in my happiest moment Charles I felt a pang at my heart and apprehended a discovery that would have overwhelmed me with the blushes of confusion In the course of our rambles your sanction provided for me several amiable friends I had too much veneration for the  name  of wife to injure it by any  light or unbecoming behaviour and I have the felicity to reflect that my deportment under this assumed character was in all respects conjugal and exact well was it for me nevertheless dear Charles that our passion for travel did not allow us to stay long in a place Your situation must soon have been publicly known even the political  disguise  of your  real  name must have been seen through your fatal preengagement with Cleora would have been detected and the endearing countenance that was before shewn me while I lay under the shelter of a charming imposition would be ignominiously withdrawn That this in part  has  been the case you cannot  but remember I have occasionally been met by an old acquaintance of yours who hath officiously circulated the secret of our connexion and my character became in an instant suspected or at least ambiguous  The industry with which I applied to those accomplishments in which it is the chief glory of women to excel and the books and masters which you recommended to me for that purpose soon polished simplicity into a degree of refined knowledge and made me more deserving my Charles's society And yet my friend the agonies of my heart increased with the instructions of my head Objects and actions  soon presented themselves to me in a different light from that in which I had been accustomed to behold them the days of girlish giddiness were past and the sedater reflections of the woman succeeded From a state of rusticity and village ignorance I was able to think profoundly and compare accurately a nicer sense of right and wrong began to take place an aweful admiration for illustrious characters and a more than enthusiastic ambition to reach them seized upon my senses proportioned to the augmentation of my intellectual powers rose into greater lustre the sensibilities of my soul and under the influence of these cultivations all flowing from the generous stream  of Charles's fondness think what I must in the cool hour undergo at the thought of living in a state so palpably condemned by mandates above and below and so forcibly reprobated by every law divine and human  It was not Charles over the exigences of a precarious fortune it was not for the loss of your estate nor was it even for the gradual declinings of your health that half those tears were shed which in different places and at different periods flowed from me Studious of your serenity how often have I repress'd the sigh that was half ready to break its way through my bosom arm in arm as  we walked affectionately together amidst the perfumes of the spring or the fragrant profusions of the summer delighted too as I was with the faithful testimonies of the warmest passion that ever nature rendered mutual even then in seasons so sacred to composure the bitter idea would overtake me and I have been compelled to complain of some transient pain of the person to hide from my companion the anguish of the heart Nay Charles I have often sought out a hidingplace when my heart was overcharged to relieve it by tears That Cleora and you could not live amicably together that I was the woman of your choice that incidents perfectly uncommon united us that  we both lived in the strictest fidelity that our passion was as elevated as ever inhabited the human bosom and that we were every thing that is precious to each other were by no means counterballances to the censure of the world the violation of moral obligations the strokes of my own conscience and the claims of Cleora which my avow'd residence with you  seemed  at least to intercept  Collect yourself sufficiently Charles to put these several sentiments together consider them one by one as you arrange them in due order and form them into a whole When you have done this quiet I beseech you the disorders of every rebellious passion  and let reason in her robes of sobriety sit in judgment The sentence which she passes will command your attention methinks I see her from her aweful throne in the center of the human heart preparing to speak hark Charles I hear her voice and it shall decide between us Persevere Charlotte persevere in these resolutions she says "Forbear Charles forbear to throw thy temptations again in the path of the penitent"  The very force of the image of Charles invigorates my virtue and gives me fresh spirits to persist  Farewell CHARLOTTE  LETTER XX CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  AWEFUL admirable girl I bow to the dignity of thy superior soul I yield to the sentiments it is impossible to controvert Yes cruel world I will henceforth bleed in silence a victim to thy circumscribed opinions Your resolves Charlotte are I perceive as the rock that defies the batter of the winds and of the waves Your virtue  commands  and my passions shall  obey  adieu adieu for ever to CHARLES  LETTER XXI CHARLES TO HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  THE struggles of conscience have again prevailed over the tenderness of love and I have lived a whole week without the society or even the sight of Charlotte Leave I desire you as soon as possible and hasten to the apartments of the unhappy  CHARLES  LETTER XXII CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  YOUR last short letter was as a cordial to the spirits of a swooning creature Noble noble youth how agreeably you flatter me and is it possible that Charles can be a convert to the sentiments of Charlotte has she been so happy as to vindicate her own conduct and kindle in his heart the sparks of imitation imitation did I say no my dear friend has twice the power and ten times the goodness of Charlotte if he will but exert them Have I not  known him melt and soften into sympathy at the pitiable circumstances of a distressed enemy have I not seen the tear of gratitude in his eye and his hands folded together for pain alleviated danger escaped differences accommodated and comforts multiplied is he not the friend of all that want of all that wish hath not nature directed his hand to his purse to divide with the indigent or the soliciting the last efforts of his liberality doth not his  own  miseries teach him to feel for  others  and suggest to him all the finer obligations of morality  And can such a character can such an exalted spirit long remain insensible  to a duty of the greatest magnitude impossible impossible 'Tis I only I have been to blame in winding my fatal image and destructive affections round his heart till it became entangled beyond the power of extrication Long ago would this excellent young man have recovered the dignity of his duty had not I prevented it I should have slown before since his delicacy was too great to quit  me  my virtue should sooner have urged me to quit  him  Perhaps by this time he might have quite forgotten me or only at most have recollected me with the indifference I deserve  It is however some consolation that I have at last been equal to the impulses of my reason and I cannot but hope the most salutary effects will arise from them Already my dearest friend for as such I shall ever consider him is open to conviction to be  so  is one great step towards every thing laudable and desirable to see the path of virtue and to be pleased with it is a powerful inducement to pursue it without any suture deviations I rise every morning more reconciled to my separation and I can command my thoughts from the image of Charles when I find them wandering that way with the cost only of a few tears my slumbers are not indeed sound nor  can I frequently close my eyes but I can meditate without distraction and know the direction of the only man upon earth whom III whom whomII say I can reflect upon the very spot where I suppose Charles to be sitting without passing by his door or knocking at it for admittance for  that  admittance which I now hope and believe he will after the lapse of a few months refuse me except upon the terms of an ordinary acquaintance No Charles no not an  ordinary  acquaintance neither I could not bear to receive from  you  the forms of compliment or the cold civilities of a mere wellbred decorum If we ever do again see each other let it be with kindness with  attention with friendship and with any thing  from  the extremes either of relapsing fondness or fashionable disregard it would be extremely aukwardperhaps it would be utterly impossible for Charles and Charlotte ever to meet upon so ceremonious a visit nor will it I dare say be necessary The passion will be altered the sensibilities of love will be extinguished but the sentiments of a pure and established friendship may and  must  remain  You have now set my heart at rest and the favours of your pen upon more lively and interesting subjects will indulge while they improve the now happier  CHARLOTTE  P S  Not a word yet about my sister Polly but you have been too much vexed with your own feelings and I make myself satisfied she is an innocent cottager atwith her mother  LETTER XXIII CHARLOTTE to CLEORA  MADAM  I STILL remain steady in pursuing the measures I have taken and though my endeavours were twice ineffectual before yet I now feel myself equal to the sacrifices which my own conscience and justice to you  require Your husband seems already to be sensible of my propriety and ceases to talk upon a subject I am truly labouring to forget for ever I have heard  your  story and  his  and I am utterly unable and a very improper person to say who is in the right It is most likely you will pardon me that both of you are in the wrong family differences are much too delicate for one  out  of the family to interfere in them The injuries however I have done you are at an end and Charles is at full liberty to repair the mischiefs if indeed they are the heaviest on  his  side of Cleora That any thing not extremely substantial should disunite him from so much sense and  beauty as you Madam are possest off would be such a repugnance to every part of his character that I cannot readily conceive it possible and yet it appears to me full as strange and unaccountable that so accomplished a lady should not have the power to fix the affections of a man whose heart is extremely tender and whose love of domestic happiness is the manifestly first principle of his ambition  These mysteries make it improper for me to say more than that I cordially wish if it is for his felicity and for yours that whatever has past may be obliviated that a single trace of his connection with the most unfortunate  Charlotte may never interrupt you and that whatever becomes of me you may pass the long remainder of your days in reconciled tenderness and restored affections  Although Madam I can no otherwise promote this than by my good wishes and persevering in my good resolutions yet I think it a part of my duty to tell you that your husband's present lodgings are at  There either you or your letters will find him and whatever you expect from him may you receive it  from his justice or his sensibility  I am Madam  the truly penitent CHARLOTTE  P S  I ought to give you the caution of directing to him under cover to his friend Mr K whose address you know and who will deliver your letter immediately on the receipt of it Poor Charles's situation renders  this  necessary to his personal safety and neither you nor I Madam can be indifferent to that  LETTER XXIV  An unknown person to  CLEORA  I AM just informed Madam that your circumstances demand the attention of benevolence and as I know the present situation of your husband were you both happily united could not allow him to assist you I have taken the liberty as a very old friend to your family to inclose a modicum which though shamefully small is I protest to you proportioned to the immediate ability of  Madam  Your most obliged humble servant  LETTER XXV CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  A WEEK's silence my dear Charles must sure have done great things you certainly find it for your ease to lay down the pen which used so frequently to address Charlotte and therefore I submit to the suspension of your correspondence Possibly I am by this time an object only of friendly and undisturbed contemplation I will endeavour to rejoice at the supposition 'tis what I ought to doNow then my friend summon yourself to the undertaking I have made the  first  sacrifice to virtue do you collect all your strength to sustain a  second  Your wife is now in London Charles and the child which you have so long and anxiously wished to fondle in your arms is now blooming in beauty by the side of her Your barbarous mother voluptuous in her age and wicked in her weeds denies any longer to support or educate the babe and the little fortune is at present locked up and is likely to remain so till the sale of that estate of which you have been iniquitously robbed is compleated In the worst dilemma however your talents are always a sufficient resource for the subsistance of  human life She who indeed loves will love in all circumstances she who feels as she  ought  to feel will follow her object into the worst of all possible situationsWhat say you to an interview with Cleora can you not obliterate the idea of the subjects which parted you and visit each other without a past unnecessary reflection I have been several hours in her company There is nothing in her person but what might attract a husband's attention her understanding is even masculinely strong She doats upon the child you have presented to her She denies the infamous charge that either malice or wantonness brought against her fame she is young  handsome accomplished well born your real wife and in distress oh heavens can such a heart as Charles's remain hardened or can he close his eye upon such a picture a picture glowing with the two principal portraits of his own family  Admitting however that you cannot feel upon this occasion all the luxury of a lovematch admitting that Cleora wants the power to delight ought she not to be received as a married wife and though you may want ability to be transported yet cannot you entertain enough of that friendship which you always allow to our sex to live within the limits of propriety in fine Charles  if you can avoid absolute aversion on the one hand and altercation to which I am sure you are not by nature inclined on the other it is a plain point of honour and conscience to invite her again to your arms  Believe me my friend she is the only woman in the creation I could bear to see there but I have been the  seeming  instrument of keeping you from herthe  real  one I am sure I have notand therefore it would give me a pleasure inexpressible to bring you together even before I have totally conquered my own partialities Do Charles do endeavour to give my vanity the gratification  of one distinguished action let me have one opportunity to shew those who have aspersed me that I had something like a soul at the bottom Exert yourself I charge you and let it be said that Charles was capable of a dignity in conduct which was not unworthily emulated by  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XXVI HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  to CHARLES  AM I never to see my best friend the amiable Charles permanently happy is he for ever  to be subjected to these anxious vicissitudes and is one of the noblest of human hearts thus constantly to be tortured on the wheel of misfortune If you bear as ill the third elopement of Charlotte as you did the first and second I shall dread to see you sure never did a young man possess so unfashionable a fidelity and yet I cannot blame you the value of the object justifies the constancy and violence of the passion  If to her share some female errors fall  Look in her face and you forget them all  The beauties of your Charlotte both mental and bodily are indeed too attractingly eminent to be easily worn from the memory of a man who hath not only possess'd but so greatly contributed to polish them  I have long known her merit long paid to it the tribute of my admiration and as long lamented the bar that prevented the union of which she is so truly deserving From the ripening refinements of her mind however and from the ardent precipitation of her temper tinctured as it is with a little both of enthusiasm and romance I apprehended something of this sort would ensue from  the meeting of her and Cleora should that ever happen  How unlucky is it that the point is on all sides too nice and critical to be spoken to I most heartily wish all wives well and all lovers happy above all other things I have  ever  wished it upon solid motives their hearts were moulded for each other the joys sorrows evil and good they have mutually sustained in the course of a long and faithful interchange must have bound them in chains of peculiar force And yet as the matter  has  fallen out what has my friend to do but to exert his phi  hy and call all the powers of  is assistance  I am heartily glad you are in London where uneasiness of any kind may be whirl'd off much sooner than in the country The shades are infectious rural objects and especially to a poetical mind are absolutely so many distractions I would not have you by any means venture into those parts of the country where you have of late been used to reside The idea that should not be indulged will obtrude itself in a moment every thing you behold from the leaves of the tree to the husbandman at his labour will revive the treacherous image you should eradicate  Rather my good friend pursue a different course however reluctantly  rush into mixt and multiplied society Indulge not the softness of relaxing solitude Engage for a short time in all the frivolous scenes of busy existence Let the great soul stoop a little and condescend to be amused by innocent levities Superior as you are I would now advise you to frequent the places of public resort and in short I would advise every thing gay and airy except downright dissipation Against that I would caution you for you already know its ineffectuallity I shall be in town on Thursday and will dedicate my time totally to you In the mean while pray think of Charlotte only as a departed friend as one who does and must ever wish you  well but whose present absence is necessary to her future happiness You see Charles by the dull commonplace of this letter that it is a subject I really know not how to treat I am honestly the friend of Charles and Charlotte what then is to be said upon this trying crisis I will only say that if the smallest degree of either's happiness depended upon me my power should be exerted before it could be solicited Be of good courage look about you think little read less sigh seldom smile as often as you can and God bless you Such are the hints of your ever faithful servant  HAMLET TEMPLETON  LETTER XXVII CHARLES to HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  FOR the second time in my life I am absolutely inebriated Dead drunk Templeton in the vain effort of drowning my distraction and your letter was delivered to me over the dizziness of the third bottle  Charlotte is fixt in the frost of her resolutions and I have ceased to address her on my subject Heavy hung the hours upon my hand and I have been endeavouring to shorten them by forgetfulness Ah Templeton  I have gone suddenly from the extremes of melancholy to those of madness I called upon a vacant acquaintance who never felt a poignant woe in his life who laughs at tenderness and snaps his fingers at love and in the very stupor of my soul strolled with him into a tavern I am this moment every thing but delirious and I have compelled my colleague in dissipation to drink prosperity to every step of Charlotte at least at every second glassIn this state of  capital  elevation what will become of me for the rest of the night heaven knows but as I am certain of being both sick and sorry tomorrow I am resolv'd not to be either to nightHeighheighoh Templeton  Templeton what machines we are obedient to the breath of every passion tost into tempest by every gust of disappointment or desire What a fever we are in from fifteen to five and twenty what an ague overtakes us soon after that till we are frozen to death and good for nothingOh these violent transitions I lay down my pen to pledge you in a bumper of good wishes for the health of Charlotte I would murder my brother if he refused the toast of my heartNever was I so strongly inclined to break my promise and go abruptly to her apartment I could now talk to her like an angel I could charm her with  claretcaught eloquence were she adamant from top to bottom  "Hot with the Tuscan grape and high in blood"by my soul Templeton I am just at this time a a match for every thing that could happen to meI could smooth the wrinkles of her dear indignant brow I could press her beloved hand with a tenderness so gentleI could advance to her rosy lip with so pathetic an humility a countenance so touching and a sigh so delicate that I should certainly conquer all her scruples and allure her once more to the arms that are ever extending involuntarily to embrace her The fellow who has been the companion  of my revels is both too headless and too heartless to continue any longer His dull eye twinkles in drowsiness and he had rather I perceive hug his  pillow  than the goddess of beautyThe wretch absolutely yawns Oh the negative Whatever becomes of me I will never pray no Templeton though agony of soul were to mark every moment I will never pray for the lethargies of insensibilityI will this instant go to the arms of  willing  beauty  CHARLES  LETTER XXVIII CHARLES to HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  CONFUSION and perplexity What a mistake have I blundered into Curse on the power of wine Curse on the folly that rushes into extremes In the giddiness of my cups I hastily prest my seal upon the letter intended for  you  and addressed it to Charlotte addressed to  her  what I had written in the libertine hour of drunkenness and intoxication The postoffice happened to be hard by where I had been accustomed to throw in my correspondence  and as I parted from my fuddled associate I trusted my licentious epistle to the letter box Read the inclosed Templeton and execrate the stupidity of  CHARLES  LETTER XXIX Being the inclosed From CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  SIR  YOU have directed to one friend what was I perceive designed for another the letter I return to you under cover will explain the  matter I shall only observe upon it that the fair hopes I began to entertain are again destroyed and I have the worst consequences to apprehend from your desperate and dreadful conduct I do not doubt but you put into execution the scheme you projected and practiced the odious purposes at which you glanced in the concluding lines of your letter to Mr Templeton  what  Charles are you  already  capable of this can you with a more than brutal precipitation subdue the boasted feelings of tenderness for one woman and hurry away to make an offer of your person to another  Indelicate and ungrateful youth separated as we arecould I have imaginedcould I have even believed it possible that a few days should so have prostituted  what  I fondly took to be the most constant of hearts rather than have committed so grossso disrespectfulso barbarous an action why did you not even venture as you threatened wrong as such a step would have been to call upon me The condition you were in would have in some measure excused you to me I might have advised you to return home I might haveas a friend as a sisteras a parent pointed out to you the palpable singuiltimproprietybarbarity of such an action  not Sir that the action affects me I have neither right or dominion over you I speak not upon my own account heaven knows so far on the contrary that in my very last letter I promised your reconciliation with Cleora In  her  arms I could almost bear to behold you But what could lead you to this early violation who knows what may be the consequencewho knows what multiplied mischief may spring from it Ah my friend think what a slight constitution you possessthink how long and assiduously even with all the attentions and nursings of love your Charlotte laboured to confirm your healthPerhaps the unhappy female whose favours  you have thus purchased may be one whooh Charles you have been much to blame indeed you have I am so trulyso deeply affected at this rashnessfor  your  sakethat I tremble as I sit in my chair a sigh which I cannot repress bursts from my bosom and a tear which I cannot restrain drops upon my paper If you look closely you will perceive where it fell But that is nothing a friend's health must ever be preciouswere it not for your health's sake the rashness of your conduct would not so much vex me What though you bought a  beauty  she was extremely handsome no doubt 'Tis very strange Sir that you cannot be contented with having a pretty  wife for nothing but you must in your embarrassed circumstances tooramble into houses a man of feeling should blush to enter Do not suppose I want to trace your favouritesI have no such curiosity Possibly the lady was your  fair incog  long before I left you But what indeed is that to me you are your own masterwe are utterly disunited and and andoh Charles Charles I begin to adopt the sentiment of Cleora and believe you never had the least affection for  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XXX CHARLES to CHARLOTTE After receiving the above  DEAR and justly offended Charlotte forgive me The agonies I have felt and still feel from your reproaches are even more insupportable than the absence which made me rush into the behaviour that deserved them And yet so thrive my hopes for your felicity I am less guilty than you may be led to guess from the declarations of a drunken man  Since the letter has fallen into your hands I will religiously relate the unextenuated facts  The lunacy of disappointed love and the madness of wine to which you know I am so little accustomed hurried me I must confess into all the distractions of dissipation  When the partner of my intoxication left me I was in the street scarce sensible in my head and unable to keep my heels I stood supporting myself for some time against the pillars of a door in a state of irresolution even then the image of the relentless Charlotte presented itself I would have died with pleasure  the next morning to have part that night in your company The little likelihood of this drove me to despair and calling a coach I ordered the driver to carry me to your lodgings About twenty yards from the house I pulled the checkstring and alighted the moon was in her meridian and I walked on till I came opposite your window The shutters were closed the streets were quiet and not an object near except the watchman whose nightbox was stationed within five paces of your apartment I twined my arms in a melancholy folding and directed my eye as I stood fixed to that part of the mansion which I knew you occupied There is a lane which  leads to the back of the house and I got staggeringly upon the wall that separated the property Here Charlotte as I stood upright on the ridge I commanded the adjacent apartmentsThe extreme warmth of the night had induced the inhabitant to suffer the sash about a third part open and the cooling breezes of midnight rewarded the design Ah God what were my sensations when levelling my eye to the casement I saw by the assistance of the moonbeams at this time uncommonly bright a dress that I knew At the edge of the toilet lay that very hussive which I presented to you so very lately and whose first employment was to contain the needles which assisted  in making the ruffles you left unfinished The spotted handkerchief the cap the hat and even the garters you yourself knitted were there Spread upon a chair at a small distance was a packet of papers partly unfolded perhaps the correspondence of Charlesand the curtain on the female side of the bed was undrawn at the foot it was impenetrably and enviously pinned close together Imagine oh imagine my situation for I cannot describe it The watchman neglected to inspect the lane though he sat almost at the beginning of it Love's auspicious god had surely charmed him to rest for he did not even call his hour after the clock had struck I remained  still undiscovered and could not persuade mvself to remove How shall I paint what followed ah beloved woman pardon and pity me I brought my ear even with the edge of the windowframe and listened what did I hear even the balmy breath of my Charlotte heaving somewhat interruptedly in slumber I opened my lips if aught of the perfume would reach me that I might inhale it Five minutes or more than five did I continue in this attitude and then mighty love assist me then did I hear the dearest of women starting from her sleep exclaim "This should be  his  pillowhere should his cheek reposeah  Charles Charles why did we ever meet this parting will distract me" My heart at this time prompted me to discover myself and I tremblingly put my hand to the sash and heaved it higherI could have stepped into Charlotte's bedchamber with ease another lift would have carried me into her arms but the pullies rattled you called loudly to know "who was there" and I was compelled to descend from the walls of paradise  The abruptness with which I descended brought me headlong to the ground I cut myself with pieces of broken glass and other rubbish that had been thrown into the lane  I had just risen when I once more looked at the window where to compleat my misery I saw the disrobed lovely and beautiful Charlotte pulling down the sash  Agitated as I was I dared not speak I kept my promise with you even in drunkenness and was silent under all these touching circumstances But what did all these efforts of honour cost me I thought my senses would utterly have left me  That nothing may remain concealed I will disclose even the scenes which succeeded And yet why  should  I to what end do I make you acquainted with more instances  of my weakness you wish me to hate you you have annihilated my image and you earnestly desire I should obliviate yours you detest you abhor you laugh at the agonies of  CHARLES  LETTER XXXI HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  to CHARLES  FOR heaven's sake my dear Charles be more guarded you will destroy the happiness both of Charlotte and yourself She is  palpably jealous of you every syllable in her letter declares it Her tenderness for you is even greater than ever I conjure you therefore not to injure her continue still to consider her silently as your sister and I prophecy that something will happen in the course of a little time to make her as essentially your wife by the laws of the land as she is evidently already by the laws of the tenderest love that can possibly be reciprocated At least give her the indulgence of a short period I still expect to see you happy together and I am persuaded if you let fortune take her own play without unseasonably interrupting her she will contrive matters in your favour till  all shall work together for your good Persecutions and searchings after her at present will only defeat your purposes View her therefore I again conjure you as the dearest relation in the world who cannot possibly live in the same house with you Surely there is a most delicate consolation in believing yourself most passionately beloved by an  absent  friend That you  are  passionately beloved and that you will continue to be so there is not the smallest doubt and give me as a friend leave to tell you that to suppose you are  not  is a poor compliment to Charlotte your incredulity in this case argues your want of confidence Depend upon it if she  who has torn herself from you ever finds it again in her power I mean in the power of her feelings to return she will not hesitate to crown the warmest wishes of her amiable companion who both by habit and inclination must be too dear to be soon forgotten Do you think she  has  forgotten you oh Charles you cannot be so ignorant of the workings of nature nor can you be so insensible to the peculiarly soft heart of her whose absence you are deploring Take my word for it that were you to meet twelvemonths hence your first interview would not be sustained like persons who had buried the remembrance of each other I judge not romantically  but from a knowledge of you both I judge from the scenes of lively and lasting endearment you have both experienced you can no more forget one another than you can forget yourselves Many a sad hour does she feel as well as Charles and much anguish must she undergo to support and continue these triumphs of her delicacy Once more therefore I desire you to let things take their course and by some stroke of providence Charlotte will assuredly be restored to you I am not able to settle my business here so expeditiously as I could for your sake wish But I must insist on your letters giving me all material occurrences since it is impossible  any thing should happen to you that can be matter of indifference to  HAMLET TEMPLETON  P S  I like not your scheme of indulging in wine it is only one degree more excusable than indulging with women Neither of these will assist you at present and therefore you would do better to avoid both  LETTER XXXII CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  GOOD God Charles what a life do you make me lead and what real misery hath distinguished the night and the day since the arrival of your last how can you be so ingenious to torture your own heart and mine Your scene at my window thrills me with horror What a time to be exposed to the open air careless and intoxicated too as you were what wretchedness must attend your prospect How could the impetuosity of your passion suggest such  an expedient dangerous in itself and painful in its consequences I hope however you have not cut yourself alarmingly pray get the best advice glass sometimes sticks within the skin and gangrenes Oh for heaven's sake take care Had you staid till the noise brought me to the window what would have become of us both to have denied you admittance would have been in such a situation impossible to have admitted you would have been a fresh gall to those wounds of honour which I am trying to heal If you regard either my health my happiness or my life never put me again to such severe trials  If Charles the scenes that succeeded this shocking one at my chamber window are such as an eye not wholly abandoned may dare to look upon you may send it to me I can however too readily guess the scope of it and yet it was methinks a strange heart that could just quit the most pathetic object in the world and find a gratification the next minute in the grossest  Write nevertheless and faithfully write the honest truth Tell me how happy you have been made by the miserable she whom gold allured to the man she possibly never saw before Oh Charles where has been your delicacy or if your passions  rioted over your reason why did you not seek to relieve them in the arms of Cleora Farewell you have planted a fresh dagger in the bosom of  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XXXIII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  HARDjudging Charlotte you think worse of me than you ought I have as you will presently see preserved my delicacy in spite of my dissipation did I not at this time feel too severely the  effects  of that dissipation and was I  not sitting up in my bed in defiance of a fever that almost parches the pen as I hold it I would convince you of this But I am quite exhausted and must defer this matter to a future opportunity  I am your afflicted CHARLES  LETTER XXXIV HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  to CHARLES  I HAVE met an adventure that I think may draw off your mind in some measure from its present fatal object of contemplation and therefore I will describe it as accurately as my memory permits You cannot too attentively apply yourself to those scenes which amuse the imagination and soothe the fancy  At the house of Mr where I now am on a visit from which I cannot yet politely disengage self dined the other day six people of both sexes amongst them a stripling who complained bitterly that he had been abused by the lady of his heart who after a courtship and all its costly consequences of five years had left him in the lurch kept his presents stolen his affections and turned him adrift in favour of a stupid fellow with a smooth face a laced coat and a wellturned pair of legs This poor swain made a fool of himself all dinner time could drink little eat less sighed every second and at last solemnly declared he would renounce  the sex and set out the next week to seek for indifference in rambling round the habitable globe  After this declaration he sat silent and melancholy for a long time and really infected the whole company at length an old gentleman that sat next him tapp'd him softly on the shoulder and said "he was in hopes he did not know in what  real  misery consisted and so continued he as we are all mighty  English  and inclined to be pensive I will tell you the heads of  my  history from which you will be able perhaps to deduce a very useful lesson namely that happiness hates to be  hunted  and is very seldom caught by those who  violently  pursue her She detests pressing and must come a volunteer into the service of mortals"  "All our misery or at least the greatest portions of it arise from the want of settled and consolidated sentimentsin other words from submitting to the violence of various passions without sticking to any one of them upon principle This has been my misfortune take care that it is not yours I am now you see in the decline of life and yet from the time that I came to years of discretion as  indiscreet  people too often call them I have been chacing different shadows and fluctuating tempesttost betwixt opposite  opinions At my first coming into the world a mere noviciate in all respects as it were in the very morning of exigence fancy and curiosity threw before my eye a thousand gay and glittering appearances I could neither engage in a dance or make one at a dinner or attend a concert or visit any place of public diversion without receiving some unlucky impression in favour of objects either recommended by their novelty or to which I was invited by the ardour of my temper I like you had a free hand a liberal soul and a susceptible heart my spirits were lively my ideas excursive and fancy for ever on the wing The ruling propensities of my nature  were social and I cultivated with a vigour peculiar to young people all the friendly and interesting connections"  "To rescue my friend or to prove my fidelity to him I set at nought hazard embarrassment and enterprize with all the enthusiastical vehemence of a knighterrant My efforts were without the least mercenary mixture and my opinions conceived and admitted without any suspicion Having indulged this luxury of the young man for some time till certain tokens of insincerity somewhat cooled my ardour I was taught by experience the necessity of caution and found it wholesome  to alter a little the system I had adopted instead therefore of falling in love at first sight of conferring indiscriminate favours of fixing promiscuous friendships or of lavishing offers of service to all men without caution or distinction I was tempted to enter into intercourses of a more stationary kind my appetites were now less refractory imagination had enjoyed her frolic and the curiosity of a rambling romantic heart was satisfied I now resolved to begin the world on a new principle I courted a young woman eminently beautiful and obtained her hand from this moment I entertained notions views and wishes utterly the reverse of my former ones fortune  interestchildrenfamily and posterity all crouded upon me the shilling which in my late bachelorstate I should have toss'd carelesly away I turned very deliberately and placed it as an accumulated twelvepence in my drawer"  "At the end of a year my wife presented me with a similitude of herself and the moment it came into the world I imagined it gave so sacred an addition to my character that I remember well on that very day I bustled into my barber's shop with an unusual strut and ordered a supernumerary row of curls to my peruke the better to figure as the father of a family The succeeding  year gave me a son with whom I was no sooner provided than I became anxious to provide a fortune to support him To accomplish this need I say that I adopted the most circumspect maxims I gave nothing without knowing to what end I engaged in a good business entertained but seldom threw myself as little as possible in the way of pleasurable temptation rose up early in the morning to the account book and knowing my infirmity for you must know I always loved  wine  I kept the bottle out of sight Yet in reward of this selfdenial I eat hearty slept sound and repaired the constitution which the career of the former part of my life had deplorably  shaken For several years I applied myself to the maxims of gain and in the end obtained by such industry a considerable fortune"  "About this period my sentiments underwent  another  total alteration from the domestic friend and man of business I shifted to the man of magnificence and parade and just as I had by dint of infinite drudgery obtained a good fortune I took it into my head to spend it like a fool As you are in  love  young Sir you know something about human inconsistency and therefore will not wonder at this apparent lunacy Well Sir I took it into my ridiculous head as I was saying to purchase  a piece of ground on the side of a hill in the county of Somerset upon this hill I had the nonsensical ambition to build a spacious house and in this house to my shame be it spoken I placed pictures and paintings which as the learned in those matters  told me  were extremely fine and valuable I now no longer listen'd to the chatter upon change the jargon of Garraway's nor the stupidity of the stocks I bustled no more in business took my cash out of trade set up a chaise and commenced the  eminent merchant retired from  ways  to live upon his  means I turned a bleak bare hill behind my villa into a shrubbery of sirs and the steep descent from before my front door I converted into  a garden in which I placed statues of all the great folks and that the matter might be compleat I ordered a pond to be cut in the centre that I might have at once wood water and fish into the bargain My wife however soon complained that the walls were damp my children were constantly afflicted with colds my gardener discovered that nothing either useful or beautiful would grow upon account of barren ground and the neighbouring gentry after paying a compliment to my taste in building pitied me on being unfortunate in the  situation  I made no more ado Sir but upon this I pull'd like a true baby tired of my plaything the whole edifice down even to the cornerstone  and in the rage of my heart hurried with my family again to London where I took lodgings and in mere despair and shame shut myself up for several days"  "My fortune acquired by the diligence of many years was too substantial to be much hurt by a single folly I had indeed thrown away upwards of two thousand pounds and I had got a pretty deal of experience Now mark the reverse from that day to this I do not believe I have misemployed or misplaced a single penny You see me now in the last stage of my journey My wife is in heaven and my children are in good circumstances one of my boys has  made a very good piece of arable out of that very ground which was reprobated by the indolent gardener I have rebuilt the house so as to make it fine and warm enough for a farmer and my third son has persuaded me to buy a pretty parcel of land contiguous to it As to myself after all the frolics and vagaries of youth I have something to line the easy chair of old age I have an old woman to rub my ancles when the gout hath wrapt them up in flannels my bed is the softer for being my own buying and though I do not bid every puppy put his hand into my purse yet if he can prove to me that he is not a rogue and is guilty only of raggedness I shall never be churl enough to refuse  him a cast coat that hangs idly collecting dust upon a peg nor will I send him away in the winter without warming himself against the weather by a warm seat in the chimneycorner Thus young Sir you see how fatal it is to indulge imagination I was the sport of it for a long time and happy was it for me that I condescended in the season of the grey hair to lead the life of reason"  Here my dear Charles the old gentleman ended his story which though not absolutely in point was truly entertaining and enriched by very pertinent and salutary observations In all events it will answer a very good purpose if the recital of it  in any degree alleviates the misery of my frienda friend whose joys and woes are always reverberated upon the heart of his  HAMLET TEMPLETON  LETTER XXXV CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  I HAVE health or at least strength enough returned to vindicate myself to you for I feel that I must ever remain additionally uneasy till I stand fair and unsuspected in your thoughts and opinions  True it is that I wandered into a house of ill reputation and did it with a view of burying the image which haunted my repose The utmost indeed that could possibly be expected from such an effort was not pleasure but alleviation of pain Heaven knows I did not hope for happiness from the embraces of venal beauty but merely to deaden for a moment the sense of intolerable anguish and even this was attempted in the absence or lethargy of every cool and rational faculty Shall I confess to you that I sent a creature of convenience for a wretched female who depended on her daily violations for subsistence the messenger delayed and my spirits sinking in the  interim  I swallowed a  bumper of champaign and drank to the health of Charlotte even in my debauch As I was pouring down the third glass now almost daylight I heard the rustle of silks upon the stairs What a sensation did this trifle produce but ah how unlike  that I  had been us'd to feel when the step of Charlotte animated my expectation A female came shewy laboriously adorned and as she soon told me just out of bed I began immediately to make comparisons they were indeed  odious  I look'd in the eyes for Charlotte's loveborn languishment and I found in their stead artful ogles misusing the lustre of what might once have been innocently bright I surveyed  the face for tender sensibility the form for engaging deportment and the dress for the union of elegance and judgment instead of which I beheld confident aukwardness and a flaunting variety betraying at once the taste and the trade The lady however to whom long habit had rendered every thing indifferent but finery called up a look which signified an entire compliance I must own to my dear friend that time place and opportunity all favoured Ah madam there was but one thing wanting to compleat the scene There was only wanting  inclination  In a word Charlotte confess yourself deceived in me confess that I am less infamously unfaithful  than you supposed I was shocked disgusted and burst into tears both of remorse and disappointment As soon as I recovered I threw five pieces on the table hung on my sword with a trembling hand and bade the unfortunate farewell Upon this transaction I dare not make a comment nor have I the courage to expect more than your pity for the yet ardent passion of  CHARLES  LETTER XXXVI CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  'TIS impossible I should speak upon the subject of your last I rejoice however truly in the recovery of your health of which I desire you to be extremely careful and take the liberty of a tender friend to advise you never will again put yourself unnecessarily in the way of destroying it  You make me very uneasy about my sister whom you do not mention  in any of your letterswhat can be the reason of it nor do you answer my request in relation to Cleora  Adieu I am yours CHARLOTTE  LETTER XXXVII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  I HAVE this minute received a little money If you think an apology necessary for my telling you of this or of dividing it with you as usual you must greatly have altered your opinion of  CHARLES  LETTER XXXVIII  The Answer  SEND me as much of the money you have received as is convenient but do not forget that there is a  third  person in the world less amply accommodated than might be wished by  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XXXIX CHARLOTTE to CLEORA  MADAM  CHARLES has sent me what under my present circumstances I have no right to detain and which for fear of wounding his delicacy I had not the courage to forbid his transmitting I do not doubt but he has sent a  proper  message to you at the same time I judge it a point of honour and shall esteem it a very great favour if you will not be offended at my inclosure which is undoubtedly the property of Cleora  CHARLOTTE  LETTER XL CHARLES to CLEORA  MADAM  YOU are not to be acquainted that I have lost my happiness But that is not to be the subject of this address you complain of your circumstances and I shall to the utmost of my very slender abilities be ever ready to alleviate them You will please to accept the inclosed trifle as an evidence of my future intentions  I believe you have no idea that it is possible for you and I to be reunited Without entering painfully into a repetition of the points that at first divided us I shall only observe to you that our reconciliation I mean so far as relates to our living together is  impracticable  I find that  our child  is at boardingschool at a great distance from you as your money is locked up at present the support of this must be inconvenient I have been long anxious to see and have my share of the pleasure arising from the society of the child and I will now venture to request that I may be allowed to take  upon me the care of its education under my own eye It shall receive from me all the tenderness and delicate assiduities of a father I will lead it up in the paths of honour not a sentiment shall be inculcated but those that will inspire her heart with virtue or accomplish her head with understanding Surely madam though it is necessary we should remain separate it is by no means so that we should in any degree altercate or entertain against each other a single sentiment of antipathy I beseech you therefore to allow me the common pleasure of a parent as the child is apart from you at present it may as well remain under  my  protection as that of a stranger  I have thoughts of placing it near me at an excellent seminary of which I will at the proper time give you the direction that you may favour the object of our mutual delight with your visits and maternal attention only trust it to my care and I shall be satisfied  I do not insult you with a sentence in relation to a late connection Whatever were the disagreements betwixt you and me may they never be communicated to the curiosity of the public and as to my intercourses elsewhere may they never come within your knowledge to distress you Farewel  I am your obedient servant CHARLES  LETTER XLI HAMLET TEMPLETON  ESQ  TO CHARLOTTE  DEAR MADAM  IT is not without great uneasiness I find it necessary to be the amanuensis of your old correspondent Charles who is in a condition that renders it impossible for him to take up the pen at present In a word madam he is wounded and I seriously fear at the point of death The cause of this you will better learn  from the inclosed than from any thing I can possibly say upon the subject He wishes exceedingly to hear from you although he does not know that I am addressing you and therefore I must beg you will not take any step to acquaint him by what means the news of his illness arrived  I am with the best wishes for the health and happiness of both  Dear Madam  your most obedient humble servant HAMLET TEMPLETON  LETTER XLII CHARLES TO H TEMPLETON ESQ  Inclosed in the above  I WRITE to you with my left arm in a sling and a ball in the bottom of my breast as yet vainly endeavoured to be extracted the anguish of my mind exceeds that of my body and I have no relief but from writing to you and that  is  a relief although it is not without a great deal of pain I hold the pen my surgeon however has left me for an  hour and I am resolved to employ the interval of his perfections in relating to you the principal circumstances of a quarrel that ended in blood on both sides  I was on Tuesday last at a public dinner in the city whither I went in the hand of an acquaintance on purpose to dissipate a little and to expel thought by looking about me The glass was briskly circulated and after we had run rapidly the round of general healths such as the king church royal family  c c  we came home to the private toasts of the heart and drank each to the prosperity of his passion and the happiness of his mistress In the sincerity  of my heart I verged a little upon common ceremonies and gave the divine Charlotte I was pleased to see many politely ready to fill his glass of good wishes but a person at the other end of the table repeated her name two or three times sarcastically and at last in a kind of half whisper told his companion that she was to be  had  at but that her price was confoundedly high I desired an explanation of this smoke the  favourite  said the gentleman simpering to his companionThe companion called to order and I sat down we drank freely and though my heart lay burning within my bosom I did not revive the subject 'till the toast came  round to the person who had insulted me He proposed a lady I drank her health and then apologizing to the master of the treat for being unable to stay longer withdrew  I retired hastily into a room belonging to the same tavern and soon found from my landlord the name and quality of the person which at present employed my thoughts he was an half pay officer of 's regiment Pen and ink being brought I wrote as follows  To Lieutenant A  SIR  YOUR profession leaves your courage unsuspected Without commenting therefore on wanting the manners of a British soldier I have only to hint that you have  insulted  a gentleman who is waiting for you where the bearer will privately conduct you I am stepping out to prepare  properly  for your reception as I presume neither of us are prepared in that way but I shall return immediately  After I had folded up and sent the waiter with this billet I went to a  gunsmith's in the neighbourhood and soon provided a brace of pistols with which I returned The officer sent a verbal message by the servant that he should not attend to such kind of engagements 'till the company broke up and perhaps after that he might be in a humour to correct a stripling who was hot enough to fight for his w Stung beyond measure at this I ran abruptly into the diningroom and placed myself opposite to the insulter He was that minute entering into what he was pleased to suppose the history of our former separation having heard as it appeared some absurd story on that subject He broke off upon my entrance and filled his glass just as he  was lifting it to his lip I rose and in a whisper told him my contemptible opinion of a  scoundrel  especially when he happened to disgrace a cockade The colour of rage immediately rose over our hero's countenance and he threw the contents of his glass into my face All measures being now taken between us I withdrew a second time and the lieutenant was held by his companions  My pains Templeton are so acute I must rest a little  LETTER XLIII CHARLES TO H T  ESQ  In Continuation  I WENT to a coffeehouse that luckily faced the door of the tavern so that when the lieutenant came away it would be impossible for him to escape unseen In about an hour he came out by himself without his hat as if he had stolen from the company upon some necessary pretence and was desirous to find me I shewed myselfThe lieutenant beckoned to me and I followed him With the first opportunity  he called a hackney coach into which we both got and rode in it sullenly till we came to the apartment of the Lieutenant Both of us threw down a shilling for the fare because either disdained the obligation in such a ease of being treated He conducted me into a large well furnished diningroom where after having turned the key he begg'd pardon for not attending me at the first summons and proposed an immediate accommodation of differencesWe fought he conqueredI fell  I must pause Templeton a second time the surgeon knocks at the door My anguish is severer than ever  LETTER XLIV CHARLES to H T  Esq  in conclusion  I AM much more mangled without being more relieved after near an hour's misery the ball remains in my body and I am not able to finish my account of the duel The surgeon begins to look awful his eye seems to menace actions still more bloody He has almost cut into my heart The next experiment will probably discover it to the spectator ah that Charlotte was then presentah that she could  see  it  throbbing for herafter that I could wish its motion to cease for ever  But no matter You are my friendI shall never acquaint Charlotte with the transaction its motives or its consequencesyou are my friend if therefore you wish to see me alive hasten to  CHARLES  LETTER XLV CLEORA to CHARLES  SIR  A Correspondence would be inconsistent I shall most certainly endeavour to keep you and Charlotte asunder That I have been instrumental in so good a measure is my chief glory even though I have not the most distant idea of being with you myself nay even though you now want the power to please  CLEORA  P S  I shall not trust the child from its mother's protection  LETTER XLVI CHARLOTTE to H T  Esq  CHARLOTTE intreats Mr Templeton to be in the birdcage walk of St James's park within fifty paces of Buckingham gate this evening at seven o'clock where a relation of Charlotte's who has the greatest desire to see Charles will be extremely obliged to Mr T if he will conduct him as he is a stranger to Charles's lodgings  Beseeches Mr T will not fail to come and that in the mean time the matter may not be mentioned to Charles for whose illness Charlotte is truly concerned  LETTER XLVII H T  Esq  to CHARLOTTE  MR T will certainly observe Charlotte's appointment and conduct her kinsman to the unhappy Charles from whose body the ball is this minute dislodged at the price of such incisions and torments as  surely no other man has the fortitude to bear In the height of the torture as the blood was flowing from the flesh he press'd Mr T's hand and told him in a whisper even with a smile on his face that he was suffering in the cause of the vindicated Charlotte  The injunctions mark'd in the note will be religiously attended to by Mr Templeton  LETTER XLVIII  From the same to the same  I DARE not advise at present either a discovery or a second experiment The spirits of poor Charles are in too great a hurry and as his fever intermits it might be more dangerous than if it was as before perfectly delirious Depend upon it I will never leave him and tell you from time to time very faithfully how he goes on  The Lieutenant who wounded him sends a polite enquiry every day  His  cure and  your  felicity would give the sincerest satisfaction to  H T  LETTER XLIX CHARLOTTE to H T  Esq  IT is not romance it is not a flight of fancy I must see him againI must see him instantly Fear not any discovery I will thicken my disguiseI will discolour  my cheeksI will stain my complexionI will do any thing so as you will yourself keep my secret and let me see him this night Write directly and say that you will call upon me by seven o'clock I will wait even till eight with patience but if you cruelly exceed that hour ah Mr Templeton I mustindeed I must see him  CHARLOTTE  LETTER L CHARLOTTE to H T  Esq  PARDON my impatiencepardon such perpetual messages and letters I write now only to tell you of an expedienttell me the name and give me the address of Charles's surgeon I'll acquaint you of my reasons for this speedily I hope no turn for the worse has happened since my last What an unfortunate creature am I to occasion such complicated mischief to so amiable a man  The bearer waits for an answer  CHARLOTTE  LETTER LI H T  Esq  to CHARLOTTE  DEAR MADAM  THE surgeon who has the care of Charles is named Melbank and his residence is in St James'sstreet I am very sorry again to acquaint you that our wretched friend is in the delirium of a fever in its worst state and calls ravingly several times in an hour on his Charlotte Mr Melbank is to bring with him in the morning or perhaps  this evening another surgeon of eminence and a physician resolving to proceed no farther without assistance  I am Madam  your humble Servant H T  LETTER LII CHARLOTTE to Dr MELBANK  I AM interested Sir beyond expression in the life of your patient Charles and have been in some measure the occasion of his present disorder  There are the most delicate reasons why I would not just at this crisis pay him an open visit but if vou will take me in your hand under the disguise of a student in physic and surgery I will provide myself with the dress and wait upon you in the evening Oh Sirit is vain to attempt these transparent concealments  I  am the most miserable CHARLOTTE I am that unhappy girl for whom he fought for whom he was wounded Mr Templeton has no doubt made known to you the particulars of your story If he has am I not to be pitied am I not to be justified in taking a step apparently romantic but truly affectionate truly innocent in order to see the man  whom I have plunged into blood Notwithstanding this I will not call upon you till permitted and I beg you will on no account reveal this circumstance to any person unless to Mr Templeton  CHARLOTTE  LETTER LIII CLEORA to CHARLES  AND so Sir I find you have demanded satisfaction of a certain gentleman for only speaking  slightly  of Charlotte's constancy although  you could suffer several licentious young fellows to circulate the most infamous falshood to the dishonour of your wife's character But this I suppose in the fine gentleman's calendar is  gallantry  and I must set it down to the account of  genteel life  CLEORA  LETTER LIV H T  Esq  to CLEORA  MADAM  FAR be it from me to interpose a single sentiment betwixt two persons of the same family at variance  but just for the present I am desired by the surgeon to beg you would forbear any severity in your letters and indeed if you knew Charles's present situation you would at least stay till he is able to defend himself by holding the pen to answer you  I am Madam  your obedient servant H T  LETTER LV CHARLOTTE to CHARLES  YES Charles I confess it It was Charlotte who took you by the hand it was she who came into your sick chamber under the disguise of a man's habit and smoothed your uneasy pillow nor do I repent or blush at it As I perceive you are pleased at it I rejoice in the stratagem and defy the sneers of such as have the heart in those circumstances to withstand the best of its impulses I enjoin you oh my dear  Charles to compose yourself and remember that in your life is involved the life of  CHARLOTTE  LETTER LVI CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  I KNEW it was impossible to be mistaken I knew it by a thousand circumstances by the brow of alabaster delicately meander'd by the cerulian of the veinsby the silken eyelashby the soft pressure of the handby the rosy lipah Charlotte  my very senses returned to welcome you pain stood suspended and pleasure advanced my wound was well for the momentmy heart acknowledged you Did I not lay your dear hand upon it did it not bound in gratitude  What can I say Charlotte I am easierI am betterI shall soon be well And is your life indeed wrapt up in mine be it so Your wishes will be granted Heaven will spare Charles for the sake of Charlotte What wonders have you worked in a momenta single interview  Oh CharlotteI shall live

severe strokes of hard fortune attend him I know your generosity Sir and beg leave to invite it on this most interesting occasion Ah my dear father you know not how extensive a happiness I could make were you to transmit me an order for the trifling sum of fifty pounds if I cannot obtain it any other way from your liberality I entreat that it may be considered as so much in advance of my next year's allowance I will live the more saving and oeconomical in order  to serve my friend But why do I say this you will applaud my sentiments you will encourage the noble feelings of social sympathy and congratulate yourself and your son 'Twere unnecessary to observe that my poor friend has been already reduced to part with several things of value which I have one by one carried in the dusk of the evening to those who lend money to the children of distress upon depositing the very necessaries of life  I am honoured Sir  your most dutiful H T  LETTER LVIII Sir HENRY TEMPLETON to HAMLET TEMPLETON  Esq  NOW the murder's out I find I shall forbear henceforward to wonder at your extravagance or at the various shifts you are driven to to support it Upon my word young gentleman you are a mighty pretty fellow a very prince of generosity a perfect Pilades and pray who  is  this heroic Orestes but no matter and so you want to fleece the old fellow out of fifty pieces do  you very well pushed I must confess but it won't take I warrant you now if I should be blockhead enough to send you a draft for this money you and your friend would be both cured of your sickness and your sorrows and hug yourselves happily at having humbug'd the old put of a father  I am mightily tickled with the compliment you pay my generosity at the expence of my prudence As much as if you had said to a lady madam I admire your eyes if they were not in the way of your nose and I am charmed with your teeth only it is a pity they overhang your lips Between you and I Sir it is not  quite clear to me whether your generosity as you call it will not one day or another exalt you above the heads of the people and give you a preeminent  exit  at Tyburn Why you no more mind fifty pounds than fifty fleabites or so many snaps of the finger Do you know Sir that fifty pounds will buy me a pair of horses for my carriage that it will equip me in cloaths for two yearsthat it is more than you ought to have  per annum  and find every thing although I am fool enough to double it  If I will give you an order for this sum you will live more  oeconomically  so you  can  live more oeconomically  can you why you are a prodigal by your own confession and I have a great mind to sink the half of your allowance from this day till you are pinched into prudence I can't conceive where the plague you got that cursed talent for lavishing money none of my family nor any of your mother's were ever spendthrifts We were all upon the saving order Zounds sir I have had three sets of buttons upon one suit of cloaths but you scorn to set any thing off savingly and by the way of Cheapside as I used to express myself I have absolutely heard you laugh at soling a pair of shoes you never would suffer my taylor to  turn  cloth of eighteen shillings  per  yard  and I have seen you toss up your nose at a finedrawn stroke in the elbow for all this you can condescend to go skulking with a bundle under your arm in the dusk of the evening to a pawnbrokers Zounds sir what a lowspirited dog you must be to run into such a horrid place with a coat a shirt and an old pair of stockings  To be plain young man I do not expect any good from you while you are so consumedly liberal and ready to give away your money to every coxcomb or impostor that asks for it But 'tis as I ever said "lightly come lightly go" Be that as it may I will not send you a single shilling to  spend in such romantic purposes and I would rather relieve any wound than that occasioned by a duel Every fellow that dares to lift up his hand against the life of another ought to smart for it and I should be sorry for any one to escape out of such an infamous encounter without the loss of a limb or a scar at the least If the truth was known I don't doubt but your friend fought for a wench or because he was drunk or because he wanted better and wiser employment Let the fact however be what it will I am very angry that you should be a very great fool yourself and that you should endeavour to make me a much greater  I am your offended father HENRY TEMPLETON  LETTER LIX CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  I Continue to mend and yet the inhuman Melbank still denies me the use of pen and paper but I have bribed my nurse to buy me some and she keeps it under lock and key These physical folks are such pedants Can any thing in nature so soon or so effectually contribute to my recovery as writing to and hearing from the amiable Charlotte Her senseher eleganceher delicacy her gentlenessher love I mean her  friendship  are all so many cordials to me I lay themI lay the  letters which contain the marks of them upon my pillow and they add softness to the downI press them upon my bosom even till they touch my wounds and they act as the healing balm or restoratives of life health and joyI then carry them to my heart and it pants to confess from whence they came How then can this cruel Melbank tell me that I must stifle such ideassuch actions how can he say they will agitate me into a relapse You Charlotte are acquaintedyou have perhaps some interest with Cleora If so intercede with her I beseech you for my child She never sees it herself and yet she will not allow it the shelter of a father's arms She is  every way unkind But I must not indulge melancholy reflections I already feel the effect of them My spirits are flutteredmy pulses are irregular Melbank is coming to dress my wound I wish to heaven I was well enough to discharge him I had rather die than be denied to correspond with Charlotte Melbank is at the door The nurse shall hurry away my writing instruments  Adieu CHARLES  LETTER LX Dr MELBANK to CHARLOTTE  YOU delay the recovery of your friend's health madam Your letters disorder and affect him too much Every thing that alarms every thing that excites a tumultuous passion should be most cautiously avoided in his present state You cannot conceive what an injury you are doing and all the endeavours of nature and a surgeon will be ineffectual if you do not desist I will give you a call this afternoon and explain the nature of this mischief  more explicitly In the mean time I hope you will excuse the wellintended advice of  Your obedient servant ERSKINE MELBANK  LETTER LXI CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  MY friend Mr Templeton is suddenly summoned from my chamber to attend the funeral of a superannuated cousin at Sir Henry his father's seat in the country and the closehanded old baronet only sent him an order for five pounds to carry him almost an  hundred miles though he is heir to near seven thousands a year As this great consolation is taken from me let it inspire the benevolence of Charlotte and then she will charitably employ her pen in forwarding the recovery of  CHARLES  LETTER LXII Dr MELBANK to CHARLOTTE  NOtwithstanding dear madam what I urged to you in tenderness to your friend Charles last night in regard to the danger of  writing pathetic letters before the nervous system could bear such alarming concussions I would not on any account have you take any notice of this friendly hint to my patient He might misconstrue it Young men of lively spirits and animated tempers are apt to mistake  You  however see my motive and will take your measures accordingly I cannot but use this opportunity to applaud the dignity of your resolutions in regard to the separation 'Tis an effort even superior to the virtue of the Spartan Ladies 'tis Roman'tis Christian How much ought you to be celebrated for so illustrious an action and how infinitely ought Cleora to sound your praises  at the same time my good lady are you not a little too enterprizing to continue the correspondence was it not a little too much in the novel strain to come in a boy's habit and display such various beauties to the eye of Charles in such a situation softened as he was by sickness touched as he must be at the discovery you recollect to what an embarrassment he was reduced did not he faint did not he fall lifeless on the pillow and was it not with great difficulty you yourself could support the conflict suffer me to say such trials if frequent would stagger the firmest philosophy and I doubt it is at best rashness to put too much confidence in our own strength when we  oppose it to those passions which too often turn strength into weakness It is certainly your duty to avoid the temptation as much as possible and this you can do only by assiduously avoiding every thing that reminds you of the object Don't you know my dear Madam that in epidemic distempers we are only secure while we escape the touch of the contagious person and with respect to wounds of the mind they are like those of the body if we venture abroad too soon or thinking ourselves quite cured if we run hastily into circumstances that hurt us before we shall in all human probability have a return of our complaint and a  relapse in either case is often worse than the first attack  To drop however the language of my profession and speak as a moralist I must every way and by every argument recommend it to you to lay aside the corresponding pen every line in every letter stirs the embers which if not meddled with would go out till in the end the fatal passion which at first kindled the original flame would be utterly extinguished But I beg pardon I am too hastily assuming the soft authority of friendship I confess madam your merit has greatly interested me in your welfare and  this  with the duty I owe to my patient  and the sincere love I bear to virtue will unite to plead my excuse for the great freedom I have taken  My sensibility is exceedingly hurt at your offering to settle Charles's account with me for my attendance I am well informed madam of that young gentleman's misfortunes and my chief uneasiness upon that subject arises from not knowing  how  I can assure him the visits I have paid him were on the score of a friendship which his merit hath powerfully excited in the breast of  E MELBANK  LETTER LXIII CHARLES to CHARLOTTE  TWO days run away and not  one  letter but you may be illyou may be incapable of writing Oh heaven forbid that I would rather find myself neglected than have you furnished with an apology from real indisposition Yet indeed Charlotte if you  can  you  should  write and write longer letters than ever There is more necessity for such an indulgence I am very weak my wound heals tardilymy friend is absent and a nurse's officiousness  is by no means like the tender attentions of a lover or a friend Ah what a blessing would my Charlotte's society now be how might she support me with her kind arm as I made gradual efforts to walk across my chamber from her hand how acceptable would be the bitterest draught and the most nauseous drugs that could be administered in the middle of the day when the sun favoured the attempt here might Charlotte lead me to the opened window till I revived the balmy air would be additionally salubrious the warm beams of noon would be doubly genial if Charlotte was by my side But this is impossible yet surely it is not impossible to give me  the only comfort I can now receive the innocent comfort of a daily letter the most rigid enemy could not deny me that and will Charlotte then deny it write I charge you and gild my solitary sickness with one ray of satisfaction  CHARLES  LETTER LXIV  From the same to the same  THE date of a card I have this instant received from a person in the city puts me in mind of a circumstance that brings the  tears of tender congratulation into my eyes It is the th of August my watch which hangs at the head of the bed points betwixt the hours of eight and nine It is the anniversary morning of my Charlotte's birth it is the returning day of the year that gave to the world one of the best and loveliest of women the sun darts chearfully into my chamber the sky is uncommonly azure I have opened the casement and am saluted with a breeze more balmy and serene than I ever felt in my life There is a grapevine runing along the wall till its tendrils ambitiously twist round my window and come mantling into my bedroom The foliage on the outside is  uncommonly luxurious and since I have been confined a redbreast has nested amongst the leaves He is this moment in the sweetest thrillings of his domestic song Even so near the bustle and buildings of the metropolis I have all the advantages of rural life Every thing around me seems to compliment my Charlotte What then must I feel upon the subject how must I be touchedwith what an ardent sincerity must I wish this day and every revolving one every eighteenth of Augusthow how I say must I prayhow supplicate the powers of happiness and health that  This day may be always sacred  No mourning no misfortune happen on it  That it be mark't with triumphs and rejoicings  That happy lovers still may make it holy  And ever choose it to endear remembrance  From the bottom of my heart I hail the return of this delightful morning And yet Charlotte how cruelly busy is fancy in the breast and brain of a man under certain influences what a train of objects now use before me what a vision is Imagination drawing how she swells upon the canvass what a glow in  her colouring what animation in her touches there is character in every stroke of her pencil her figures are from the life She has a hand that throws Raphael into despair Her exact similitudes captivate the eye and her resemblances subdue the heart  Methinks I now see how Charlotte employs the present day she invites the numerous circles of those that wish her well the feast is prepared the lovely entertainer in the bloom of beauty and youth sits at the head of the table as goddess of the banquet She delights more by her senses her wit and her politeness than by the delicacies of her board  And yet can it ever Charlotte ah can it ever be forgotten in what Charles used to engage upon this day will not his attention to the very hour the minutethe second of her birth be long remembered With what a more than bridal vigilance did he watch the returns of this auspicious aera how did he fondly busy himself in birthday preparationslove constant exalted love inspired his conduct upon these occasions It was love that invited the sun to shine on that day with a conspicuous lustre it was love that provided the ornament and decorating novelties which were then for the  first time  to be worn it was love that wept over the sparkling glass love it was which  gave the congratulating kissand it was love which smiled as the day closed and as the indulging night advanced to give you all accomplished to my embraces  Surely these recollections will even in the midst of natal festivity revive those sentiments in the sympathizing bosom of Charlotte which will bestow one tender sigh to the memory of affection and  CHARLES  END OF VOL I
