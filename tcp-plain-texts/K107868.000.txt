Page  A TREATISE ON THE SOCIAL COMPACT  c  BOOK I INTRODUCTION  MY design in the present treatise is to inquire Whether the nature of society admits of any fixed and equitable rules of government supposing mankind to be such as they are and their laws such as they might be made In this investigation I shall endeavour constantly to join the considerations of natural right and public interest so that justice and utility may never be disunited  This being premised I shall enter on my subject without expatiating on its importance If  it be asked Whether I am a prince or legislator that I thus take upon me to write on po+litics I answer I am neither and that it is for this reason I write Were I a prince or legislator I would not throw away my time in pointing out what ought to be done I would myself put it in practice or be silent  As the citizen of a free state and a member of the supreme power by birth however weak may be the influence of my single vote in public affairs the right of giving that vote is sufficient to impose on me the duty of making those affairs my study thinking myself happy in discussing the various forms of government to find every day new reasons for admiring that of my own country  Geneva    CHAP I The subject of the first book  MAN is born free and yet is universally enslaved At the same time an individual frequently conceives himself to be the lord and master over others though only more eminently deprived of liberty Whence can this change arise Are there any means by which it may be rendered lawful The former question  I cannot answer though I imagine myself capable of resolving the latter  If I took into consideration only the existence and effects of power I should say So long as a people are compelled to obey they do well to be obedient but as soon as they are in a capacity to resist they do better to throw off the yoke of restraint For in recovering their liberty on the same plea by which they lost it either they have a just right to reassume it or those could have none who deprived them of it But there is an inviolable right founded on the very nature of society which serves as the basis of all others Man doth not derive this right however immediately from nature it is founded on mutual convention We must proceed then to inquire of what kind such convention must have been But before we come to argue this point I should establish what I have already advanced  CHAP II On the primitive state of society  THE most ancient of all societies and the only natural one is that of a family And even in this children are no longer connected with their father than while they stand in need of his assistance When this becomes  needless the natural tie is of course dissolved the children are exempted from the obedience they owe their father and the father is equally so from the solicitude due from him to his children both assume a state of independence respecting each other They may continue indeed to live together afterwards but their connection in such a case is no longer natural but voluntary and even the family union is then maintained by mutual convention  This liberty which is common to all mankind is the necessary consequence of our very nature whose first law being that of selfpreservation our principal concerns are those which relate to ourselves no sooner therefore doth man arrive at years of discretion than he becomes the only proper judge of the means of that preservation and of course his own master  In a family then we may see the first model of political societies their chief is represented by the father and the people by his children while all of them being free and equal by birth they cannot alienate their liberty but for their common interest All the difference between a family and a state lies in this That in the former the love which a father naturally bears to his children is a compensation for his solicitude concerning them and in the latter it is the pleasure  of command that supplies the place of this love which a chief doth not entertain for his people  Grotius denies that government is invested with power solely for the benefit of those who are governed and cites the case of slaves as an example It is indeed his constant practice to establish the matter of right on the matter of fact  "The learned researches into the laws of nature and nations are often nothing more than the history of ancient abuses so that it is a ridiculous infatuation to be too fond of studying them"  Manuscript Treatise on the Interests of France by the Marquis d' A  This was exactly the case with Grotius  He might have employed a more conclusive method though not a more favourable one for tyrannical governments  It is then doubtful according to Grotius whether the whole race of mankind except about an hundred individuals belong to those individuals or whether the latter belong to the whole race of mankind and he appears throughout his whole work to lean to the former opinion This is also the opinion of Hobbes Thus they divide the human species into herds of cattle each of which hath its keeper who protects it from others only that he may make a property of it himself  As a shepherd is of a superior nature to his flock so the herdkeepers of men or their chiefs are of a superior nature to the herd over which they preside Such was the reasoning according to Philo of the Emperor Caligula who concluded logically enough from this analogy that either kings were gods or their subjects no better than brutes  This argument of Caligula bears much resemblance to those of Hobbes and Grotius Aristotle had said indeed before either of them that men were not naturally equal but that some of them were born to slavery and others to dominion  Aristotle was right as to the fact but mistook the effect for the cause Nothing is more certain than that every man born in slavery is born to be a slave In such a state men lose even the desire of freedom and prefer subjection as the companions of Ulysses did their brutality  See a little tract written by Plutarch on the rationality of brutes  If there are any slaves therefore by nature it is because they are slaves contrary to nature Power first made slaves and cowardice hath perpetuated them  I have said nothing of king Adam or the emperor Noah father of three monarchs who like the children of Saturn as some have imagined them to be divided the world among them I hope my moderation also in this respect will be esteemed some merit for as I am descended in a right line from one of these princes and probably from the eldest branch of the family how do I know that by a regular deduction of my descent I might not find myself the legitimate heir to universal monarchy Be this however as it may it cannot be denied that Adam had as good a title to the sovereignty of the world when he was the only person in it as Robinson Crusoc had to that of his island under the same circumstances A very great conveniency also attended their government in that the monarch might rest securely on his throne without fear of wars conspiracies or rebellion  CHAP III On the right of the Strongest  THE strongest is not strong enough to continue always master unless he transforms his power into a right of command and obedience into a duty Hence is deduced the right of the strongest a right taken ironically in appearance  and laid down as an established principle in reality But will this term never be rightly explained Force in the simplest sense is a physical power nor can I see what morality can result from its effects To yield to superior force is an act of necessity not of the will at most it is but an act of prudence And in what sense can this be called a duty  Let us suppose however for a moment this pretended right established and we shall see it attended with inexplicable absurdities for if it be admitted that power constitutes right the effect changes with the cause and every succeeding power if greater than the former succeeds also to the right so that men may lawfully disobey as soon as they can do it with impunity and as right is always on the strongest side they have nothing more to do than to acquire superior force Now what kind of right can that be which vanishes with the power of enforcing it If obedience be only exacted by compulsion there is no need to make such obedience a duty as when we are no longer compelled to obey we are no longer obliged to it It appears therefore that the word  right  adds nothing in this case to that of force and in fact is a term of no signification  Be obedient to the higher powers  If by this precept is meant  subject to a superior force  the advice is good though superfluous I will answer for it such a rule will never be broken All power I own is derived from God but every corporeal malady is derived also from the same source But are we therefore forbid to call in the physician If a robber should stop me on the highway am I not only obliged on compulsion to give him my purse but am I also obliged to it in point of conscience though I might possibly conceal it from him This will hardly be averred and yet the pistol he holds to my breast is in effect a superior force  On the whole we must conclude then that mere power doth not constitute right and that men are obliged only to pay obedience to lawful authority Thus we are constantly recurring to my first question  CHAP IV On slavery  AS no man hath any natural authority over the rest of his species and as power doth not confer right the basis of all lawful authority is laid in mutual convention  If an individual says Grotius can alienate his liberty and become the slave of a master why may not a whole people collectively alienate theirs and become subject to a king This proposition however contains some equivocal terms which require explanation but I shall confine myself to that of  alienate  Whatever is alienated must be disposed of either by gift or sale Now a man who becomes the slave of another doth not give himself away but sells himself at least for his subsistence but why should a whole people sell themselves So far is a king from furnishing his subjects subsistence that they maintain him and as our friend Rabelais says A king doth not live on a little Can subjects be supposed to give away their liberty on condition that the receiver shall take their property along with it After this I really cannot see any thing they have left  It may be said a monarch maintains among his subjects the public tranquillity Be it so I would be glad to know of what they are gainers if the wars in which his ambition engages them if his insatiable avarice or the oppressions of his ministers are more destructive than civil dissensions Of what are they gainers if even this tranquillity be one cause of their misery A prisoner may live tranquil enough in his dungeon but will this be sufficient to make him contented there When the Greeks were shut  up in the cave of the Cyclops they lived there unmolested in expectation of their turn to be devoured  To say that a man can give himself away is to talk unintelligibly and absurdly such an act must necessarily be illegal and void were it for no other reason than that it argues insanity of mind in the agent To say the same thing of a whole people therefore is to suppose a whole nation can be at once out of their senses but were it so such madness could not confer right  Were it possible also for a man to alienate himself he could not in the same manner dispose of his children who as human beings are born free their freedom is their own and nobody hath any right to dispose of it but themselves Before they arrive at years of discretion indeed their father may for their security and in their name stipulate the conditions of their preservation but he cannot unconditionally and irrevocably dispose of their persons such a gift being contrary to the intention of nature and exceeding the bounds of paternal authority It is requisite therefore in order to render an arbitrary government lawful that every new generation should be at liberty to admit or reject its authority in which case it would be no longer an arbitrary government  To renounce one's natural liberty is to renounce one's very being as a man it is to renounce not only the rights but even the duties of humanity And what possible indemnification can be made the man who thus gives up his all Such a renunciation is incompatible with our very nature for to deprive us of the liberty of the will is to take away all morality from our actions In a word a convention which stipulates on the one part absolute authority and on the other implicit obedience is in itself futile and contradictory Is it not evident that we can lie under no reciprocal obligation whatever to a person of whom we have a right to demand every thing and doth not this circumstance against which he has no equivalent necessarily infer such act of convention to be void For what claim can my slave have upon me when he himself and all that belongs to him are mine His claims are of course my own and to say those can be set up against me is to talk absurdly  Again Grotius and others have deduced the origin of this pretended right from the superiority obtained in war The conqueror say they having a right to put the vanquished to death the latter may equitably purchase his life at the expence of his liberty such an agreement being  the more lawful as it conduces to the mutual advantage of both parties  It is clear and certain however that this pretended right of the victor over the lives of the vanquished is not in any shape the natural result of a state of war This is plain were it for no other reason than that the reciprocal relations of mankind while living together in their primitive independence were not sufficiently durable to constitute a state either of peace or war so that men cannot be naturally enemies It is the relation subsisting between things and not between men that gives rise to war which arising thus not from personal but real relations cannot subsist between man and man either in a state of nature in which there is no settled property or in a state of society in which every thing is secured by the laws  The quarrels encounters and duels of individuals are not sufficient to constitute such a state of war and with regard to the particular combats authorised by the institutions of Lewis XI King of France they were only some of the abuses of the feudal government a system truly absurd as contrary to the principles of natural justice as of good policy  War is not therefore any relation between man and man but a relation between state and state in which individuals are enemies only accidentally not as men or even as citizens but as soldiers not as members of their particular community but as its defenders In short a state can have for its enemy nothing but a state not men as between things essentially different there can be no common relation  This principle is indeed conformable to the established maxims of all ages and the constant practice of every civilized people Declarations of war are made less to give notice to sovereigns than to their subjects  The foreigner whether a sovereign an individual or a people who plunders kills or takes prisoner a subject without declaring war against his prince is not an enemy but a robber Even in a time of war a just prince may make himself master in an enemy's country of whatever belongs to the public but he will respect the persons and private properties of individuals he will respect those rights on which his own are founded The design of war being the destruction of an hostile state we have a right to kill its defenders while they are in arms but as in laying down their arms they cease to be enemies  or instruments of hostility they become in that case mere men and we have not the least right to murder them It is sometimes possible effectually to destroy a state without killing even one of its members now war cannot confer any right or privilege which is not necessary to accomplish its end and design It is true these are not the principles of Grotius nor are they founded on the authority of the poets but they are such as are deduced from the nature of things and are founded on reason  With regard to the right of conquest it has no other foundation than that of force the law of the strongest But if war doth not give the victor a right to massacre the vanquished this pretended right which does not exist cannot be the foundation of a right to enslave them If we have no right to kill an enemy unless we cannot by force reduce him to slavery our right to make him a slave never can be founded on our right to kill him It is therefore an iniquitous bargain to make him purchase at the expence of liberty a life which we have no right to take away In establishing thus a right of life and death over others on that of enslaving them and on the other hand a right of enslaving them on that of life and death we certainly fall into the absurdity of reasoning in a circle  Let us suppose however that this shocking right of general massacre existed I still affirm that a slave made so by the fortune of war or a conquered people so reduced to slavery lie under no other obligations to their master than to obey him so long as he hath the power to compel them to it In accepting of an equivalent for their lives the victor confers on them no favour instead of killing them uselessly he hath only varied the mode of their destruction to his own advantage So far therefore from his having acquired over them any additional authority the state of war subsists between them as before their relation to each other is the evident effect of it and his exertion of the rights of war is a proof that no treaty of peace hath succeeded Will it be said they have made a convention be it so This convention is a mere truce and is so far from putting an end to the state of war that it necessarily implies its continuation  Thus in whatever light we consider this affair the right of making men slaves is null and void not only because it is unjust but because it is absurd and insignificant The terms  slavery  and  justice  are contradictory and reciprocally exclusive of each other Hence the following proposal  would be equally ridiculous whether made by one individual to another or by a private man to a whole people  I enter into an agreement with you altogether at your own charge and solely for my profit which I will observe as long as I please and which you are to observe also as long as I think proper  CHAP V On the necessity of recurring always to the primitive convention  ON the supposition that I should grant to be true what I have hitherto disproved the advocate for despotism would however profit but little There will be always a great difference between subjecting a multitude and governing a society Let individuals in any number whatever become severally and successively subject to one man they are all in that case nothing more than master and slaves they are not a people governed by their chief they are an Aggregate if you will but do not form an association there subsists among them neither commonwealth nor body politic Such a superior though he should become the master of half the world would be still a private person and his interest separate and distinct from that of his people would be still no more than a  private interest When such a person dies also the empire over which he presided is dissolved and its component parts remain totally unconnected just as an oak falls into a heap of ashes when it is consumed by the fire  A people says Grotius may voluntarily bestow themselves on a king According to Grotius therefore a people are a people before they thus give themselves up to regal authority Even this gift however is an act of society and presupposes a public deliberation on the matter Hence before we examine into the act by which a people make choice of a king it is proper to examine into that by which a people became a people for on this which is necessarily prior to the other rests the true foundation of society  For if in fact there be no prior convention whence arises unless indeed the election was unanimous the obligation of the smaller number to submit to the choice of the greater and whence comes it that an hundred persons for instance who might desire to have a master had a right to vote for ten others who might desire to have none The choice by a plurality of votes is in itself an establishment of convention and supposes that unanimity must at least for once have subsisted among them  CHAP VI On the social pact or covenant  I Suppose mankind arrived at that term when the obstacles to their preservation in a state of nature prevail over the endeavours of individuals to maintain themselves in such a state At such a crisis this primitive state therefore could no longer subsist and the human race must have perished if they had not changed their manner of living  Now as men cannot create new powers but only compound and direct those which really exist they have no other means of preservation than that of forming by their union an accumulation of forces sufficient to oppose the obstacles to their security and of putting these in action by a first mover capable of making them act in concert with each other  This general accumulation of power cannot arise but from the concurrence of many particular forces but the force and liberty of each individual being the principal instruments of his own preservation how is he to engage them in the common interest without hurting his own and neglecting the obligations he lies under to  himself This difficulty being applied to my present subject may be expressed in the following terms  "To find that form of association which shall protect and defend with the whole force of the community the person and property of each individual and in which each person by uniting himself to the rest shall nevertheless be obedient only to himself and remain as fully at liberty as before" Such is the fundamental problem of which the social compact gives the solution  The clauses of this compact are so precisely determined by the nature of the act that the least restriction or modification renders them void and of no effect in so much that although they may perhaps never have been formally promulgated they are yet universally the same and are every where tacitly acknowledged and received When the social pact however is violated individuals recover their natural liberty and are reinvested with their original rights by losing that conventional liberty for the sake of which they had renounced them  Again these clauses well understood are all reducible to one  viz  the total alienation of every individual with all his rights and privileges  to the whole community For in the first place as every one gives himself up entirely and without reserve all are in the same circumstances so that no one can be interested in making their common connection burthensome to others  Besides as the alienation is made without reserve the union is as perfect as possible nor hath any particular associate any thing to reclaim whereas if they should severally retain any peculiar privileges there being no common umpire to determine between them and the public each being his own judge in some cases would in time pretend to be so in all the state of nature would still subsist and their association would necessarily become tyrannical or void  In fine the individual by giving himself up to all gives himself to none and as he acquires the same right over every other person in the community as he gives them over himself he gains an equivalent for what he bestows and still a greater power to preserve what he retains  If therefore we take from the social compact every thing that is not essential to it we shall find it reduced to the following terms "We the contracting parties do jointly and severally submit our persons and abilities to the supreme direction of the general will of all and in a  collective body receive each member into that body as an indivisible part of the whole"  This act of association accordingly converts the several individual contracting parties into one moral collective body composed of as many members as there are votes in the assembly which receives also from the same act its unity and existence This public personage which is thus formed by the union of all its members used formerly to be denominated a CITY  The true sense of this word is almost entirely perverted among the moderns most people take a town for a city and an housekeeper for a citizen Such are ignorant however that though houses may form a town it is the citizens only that constitute a city This same errour formerly cost the Carthaginians very dear I do not remember in the course of my reading to have ever found the title of  Cives  given to the subjects of a prince not even formerly to the Macedonians nor in our times to the English though more nearly bordering on liberty than any other nation The French are the only people who familiarly take on themselves the name of  citizens  because they have no just idea of its meaning as may be seen in their dictionaries for were it otherwise indeed they would be guilty of high treason in assuming it This term is with them rather expressive of a virtue than a privilege Hence when Bodin spoke of the citizens and inhabitants of Geneva he committed a wretched blunder in mistaking one for the other Mr d'Alembert indeed has avoided this mistake in the Encyclopoedia where he has properly distinguished the four orders of people and even five reckoning mere strangers that are found in our city and of which two only compose the republic No other French author that I know of hath ever comprehended the meaning of the word  citizen    and at  present takes the name of a  republic  or  body politic  It is also called by its several members a state when it is passive the  sovereign  when it is active and simply a  power  when it is compared with other bodies of the same nature With regard to the associates themselves▪ they take collectively the name of the  people  and are separately called  citizens  as partaking of the sovereign authority and  subjects  as subjected to the laws of the state These terms indeed are frequently confounded and mistaken one for the other it is sufficient however to be able to distinguish them when they are to be used with precision  CHAP VII Of the sovereign  IT is plain from the above formula that the act of association includes a reciprocal engagement between particulars and the public  and that each individual in contracting if I may so say with himself is laid under a twofold engagement  viz  as a member of the sovereignty toward particular persons and as a member of the state toward the sovereign That maxim of the civil law however is inapplicable here which says that no one is bound by the engagements he enters into with himself for there is a wide difference between entering into a personal obligation with one's self and with a whole of which one may constitute a part  It is farther to be observed that the public determination which is obligatory on the subject with regard to the sovereign on account of the twofold relation by which each stands contracted is not for the contrary reason obligatory on the supreme power towards itself and that it is consequently inconsistent with the nature of the body politic that such supreme power should impose a law which it cannot break For as the sovereign stands only in a single relation it is in the same case as that of an individual contracting with himself whence it is plain that there neither is nor can be any fundamental law obligatory on the whole body of a people even the social compact itself not being such By this however it is not meant that such a body cannot enter into engagements with others in matters that do not derogate  from this contract for with respect to foreign objects it is a simple and individual person  But as the body politic or the sovereign derives its very existence from this inviolable contract it can enter into no lawful engagement even with any similar body derogatory from the tenour of this primitive act such as that of alienating any part of itself or of submitting itself intirely to a foreign sovereign To violate the act whereby it exists would be to annihilate itself and from nothing can arise nothing  No sooner are a multitude of individuals thus united in a body than it becomes impossible to act offensively against any of the members without attacking the whole and still less to offend the whole body without injuring the members Hence both duty and interest equally oblige the two contracting parties to assist each other and the same persons ought to endeavour to include within this twofold relation all the advantages which depend on it  Now the sovereign being formed only by the several individuals of which the state is composed can have no interest contrary to theirs of course the supreme power stands in no need of any guarantee toward the subjects because it is  impossible that the body should be capable of hurting all its members and we shall see hereafter that it can as little tend to injure any of them in particular Hence the sovereign is necessarily and for the same reason that it exists always such as it ought to be  The case is different however as to the relation in which the subjects stand to the sovereign as notwithstanding their common interest the latter can have no security that the former will discharge their engagements unless means be found to engage their fidelity  In fact every individual may as a man en+tertain a particular will either contradictory or dissimilar to his general will as a citizen His private interest may influence him in a manner diametrically opposite to the common interest of the society Reflecting on his own existence as positive and naturally independent he may conceive what he owes to the common cause to be a free and gratuitous contribution the want of which will be less hurtful to others than the discharge of it will be burthensome to himself and regarding the moral person of the state as an imaginary being because it is not a man he may be desirous of enjoying all the privileges of a citizen without fulfilling his engagement as a  subject an injustice that in its progress must necessarily be the ruin of the body politic  To the end therefore that the social compact should not prove an empty form it tacitly includes this engagement which only can enforce the rest  viz  that whosoever refuses to pay obedience to the general will shall be liable to be compelled to it by the force of the whole body And this is in effect nothing more than that they may be compelled to be free for such is the condition which in uniting every citizen to the state secured him from all personal dependence a condition which forms the whole artifice and play of the political machine it is this alone that renders all social engagements just and equitable which without it would be absurd tyrannical and subject to the most enormous abuses  CHAP VIII Of civil society in general  THE transition of man from a state of nature to a state of society is productive of a very remarkable change in his being by substituting justice instead of instinct as the rule of his conduct and attaching that morality to his actions of which they were before destitute It is in immediate consequence of this change when  the voice of duty succeeds to physical impulse and the law of appetite that man who hitherto regarded only his own gratification finds himself obliged to act on other principles and to consult his reason before he follows the dictates of his passions Although by entering into a state of society he is deprived also of many advantages which depend on that of nature he gains by it others so very considerable his faculties exert and expand themselves his ideas are enlarged his sentiments ennobled and his whole soul is elevated to so great a degree that if the abuses of this new state do not degrade him below the former he ought incessantly to bless that happy moment in which he was rescued from it and converted from a stupid and ignorant animal into an intelligent and wise Being  To state the balance of what is lost and gained by this change we shall reduce it to comparative terms By entering into the social compact man gives up his natural liberty or unlimited right to every thing which he is desirous of and can attain In return for this he gains social liberty and an exclusive property in all those things of which he is possessed To avoid any mistake however in the nature of these compensations it is necessary to make a just distinction between natural liberty which is limited  by nothing but the inabilities of the individual and social liberty which is limited by the general will of the community and also between that possession which is only effected by force or follows the right of prior occupancy and that property which is founded only on a positive title  To the preceding also may be added as the acquisition of a social state moral liberty which only renders a man truly master of himself for to be under the direction of appetite alone is to be in a state of slavery while to pay obedience only to those laws which we prescribe to ourselves is liberty But I have said too much already on this subject the philosophical meaning of the word Liberty being in this place out of the question  CHAP IX Of real demesnes  EAch member of the community in becoming such devotes himself to the public from that moment in such a state as he then is with all his power and abilities of which abilities his possessions make a part Not that in consequence of this act the possession changes its nature by changing hands and becomes actual  property in those of the sovereignty but as the power of the community is incomparably greater than that of an individual the public possession is in fact more fixed and irrevocable without being more lawful at least with regard to foreigners For every state is with respect to its members master of all their possessions by virtue of the social compact which in a state serves as the basis of all other rights but with regard to other powers or states it is master of them only by the right of prior occupancy which it derives from individuals  The right of prior occupancy although more real than that of the strongest becomes not an equitable right till after the establishment of property Every man hath naturally a right to every thing which is necessary for his subsistence but the positive act by which he is made the proprietor of a certain possession excludes him from the property of any other His portion being assigned him he ought to confine himself to that and hath no longer any right to a community of possession Hence it is that the right of prior occupancy though but of little force in a state of nature is so respectable in that of society The point to which we are chiefly directed in the consideration of this right is rather  what belongs to another than what does not belong to us  To define the right of prior occupancy in general terms it is founded on the following conditions It is requisite in the first place that the lands in question should be unoccupied secondly that no greater quantity of it should be occupied than is necessary for the subsistence of the occupiers and in the third place that possession should be taken of it not by a vain ceremony but by actual cultivation the only mark of property which in defect of juridical titles should be at all respected  To allow the first occupier a right to as much territory as he may cultivate and is necessary to his subsistence is certainly carrying the matter as far as is reasonable Otherwise we know not how to set bounds to this right Is it sufficient for a man to set foot on an uninhabited territory to pretend immediately an exclusive right to it Is it sufficient for him to have power enough at one time to drive others from the spot to deprive them for ever afterwards of the right of returning to it How can a man or even a whole people possess themselves of an immense territory and exclude from it the rest of mankind without  being guilty of an illegal usurpation since by so doing they deprive the rest of mankind of an habitation and those means of subsistence which nature hath given in common to them all When Nunez Balbao stood on the seashore and in the name of the crown of Castile took possession of the Pacific Ocean and of all SouthAmerica was this sufficient to dispossess all the inhabitants of that vast country and exclude all the other sovereigns in the world On such a supposition the like idle ceremonies might have been ridiculously multiplied and his Catholic Majesty would have had no more to do than to have taken possession in his closet of all the countries in the world and to have afterwards only deducted from his empire such as were before possessed by other princes  It is easy to conceive how the united and contiguous estates of individuals become the territory of the public and in what manner the right of sovereignty extending itself from the subjects to the lands they occupy becomes at once both real and personal a circumstance which lays the possessors under a state of the greatest dependence and makes even their own abilities a security for their fidelity This is an  advantage which does not appear to have been duly attended to by sovereigns among the ancients who by stiling themselves only kings of the Persians the Scythians the Macedonians seemed to look on themselves only as chief of men rather than as masters of a country Modern princes more artfully stile themselves the kings of England France Spain  c  and thus by claiming the territory itself are secure of the inhabitants  What is very singular in this alienation is that the community in accepting the possessions of individuals is so far from despoiling them thereof that on the contrary it only confirms them in such possessions by converting an usurpation into an actual right and a bare possession into a real property The possessors also being considered as the depositaries of the public wealth while their rights are respected by all the members of the state and maintained by all its force against any foreign power they acquire if I may so say by a cession advantageous to the public and still more so to themselves every thing they ceded by it a paradox which is easily explained by the distinction to be made between the rights which the sovereign and the  proprietor have in the same fund as will be seen hereafter  It may also happen that men may form themselves into a society before they have any possessions and that acquiring a territory sufficient for all they may possess it in common or divide it among them either equally or in such different proportions as may be determined by the sovereign Now in whatsoever manner such acquisition may be made the right which each individual has to his own estate must be always subordinate to the right which the community hath over the possessions of all for without this there would be nothing binding in the social tie nor any real force in the exercise of the supreme power  I shall end this book with a remark that ought to serve as the basis of the whole social system and this is that instead of annihilating the natural equality among mankind the fundamental compact substitutes on the contrary a moral and legal equality to make up for that natural and physical difference which prevails among individuals who though unequal in personal  strength and mental abilities become thus all equal by convention and right  This equality indeed is under some governments merely apparent and delusive serving only to keep the poor still in misery and favour the oppression of the rich And in fact the laws are always useful to persons of fortune and hurtful to those who are destitute whence it follows that a state of society is advantageous to mankind in general only when they all possess something and none of them have any thing too much    The END of the FIRST BOOK  BOOK II  CHAP I That the sovereignty is unalienable  THE first and most important consequence to be drawn from the principles already established is that the general  will  only can direct the forces of the state agreeable to the end of its original institution which is the common good for though the opposition of private interests might make the establishment of societies necessary it must have been through the coalition of those interests that such establishment became possible The bonds of society must have been formed out of something common to those several interests for if there had been no point to which they could have been reconciled no society could possibly have subsisted Now it is only on these points that the government of society should be founded  I say therefore that the sovereignty being only the exertion of the general will cannot be alienated and that the sovereign which is only a collective being cannot be represented but by  itself the power of a people may be transmitted or delegated but not their will  It may not be absolutely impossible that the will of an individual should agree in some particular point with the general will of a whole people it is however impossible that such agreement should be constant and durable for the will of particulars always tends to make distinctions of preference and the general will to a perfect equality It is further still more impossible supposing such agreement might always subsist to have any security that it would do so as it could never be the effect of art but of chance The sovereign may say My will is now agreeable to the will of such an individual or at least to what he pretends to be his will but it cannot pretend to say I agree to whatever may be the will of such individual tomorrow as it is absurd for the will to lay itself under any restraint regarding the future and as it is impossible for the will to consent to any thing contrary to the interest of the being whose will it is Should a people therefore enter into the engagement of simply promising obedience they would lose their quality as a people and be virtually dissolved by that very act The moment there exists a master there can be no longer a sovereign the body politic being thereby destroyed  I would not be understood to mean that the orders of a chief may not pass for the dictates of the general will when the sovereign though at liberty to contradict does not oppose it In such a case it is to be presumed from the universal silence of the people that they give their consent This will be farther explained in the end  CHAP II That the sovereignty is indivisible  FOR the same reason that the sovereignty is unalienable it is also indivisible for the will is general  In order that this will should be general it is not always necessary it should be unanimous it is necessary however that every individual should be permitted to vote every formal exclusion infringing the generality  or it is not it is that of the body of the people or only that of a part In the first case this will when declared is an act of sovereignty and becomes a law in the second it is only a particular will or an act of the magistracy and is at most a decree  But our politicians incapable of dividing the sovereignty in its first principles divide it in its  object they distinguish it into power and will into a legislative and executive power into the prerogatives of taxation of executing justice and of making war into departments of domestic and foreign administration Sometimes they blend all these confusedly together and at others consider them as distinct and separate making out the sovereign to be a fantastic compound just as if they should compose a man out of several bodies of which one should have only eyes another arms a third feet and nothing more It is said of the jugglers in Japan that they will take a child and cut it into pieces in the presence of the spectators then throwing up its dismembered limbs one after another into the air they are united and the child descends alive and well as before The legerdemain of our modern politicians greatly resembles this trick of the Japonese for they after having dismembered the body politic with equal dexterity bring all its parts together by  hocus pocus  again and represent it the same as before  This error arises from their not having formed precise ideas of the sovereign authority and from their mistaking the simple emanations of this authority for parts of its essence Thus for instance the acts of declaring war and making peace are usually regarded as acts of sovereignty  which they are not for neither of these acts are laws but consist only of the application of the law Each is a particular act determinate only of the meaning of the law in such case as will be seen more clearly when the idea attached to the word  law  shall be precisely settled  By tracing in like manner their other divisions we shall find that we are constantly mistaken whenever we think the sovereignty divided and that the prerogatives which are supposed to be parts of the sovereignty are all subordinate to it and always suppose the predetermination of a superior will which those prerogatives only serve to put in execution  It is impossible to say in how much obscurity this want of precision hath involved the reasonings of authors on the subject of political law when they came to examine into the respective rights of kings and people on the principles they had established By turning to the third and fourth chapters of the first book of Grotius the reader may see how that learned author and his translator Barbeyrac bewildered and entangled themselves in their own sophisms through fear of saying too much or too little for their purpose and of making those interests clash  which it was their business to reconcile Grotius being dissatisfied with his own countrymen a refugee in France and willing to pay his court to Lewis XIII to whom his book is dedicated spared no art nor pains to strip the people of their privileges and to invest kings with prerogative Barbeyrac also wrote with a similar view dedicating his translation to George I of England But unluckily the expulsion of James II which he calls an abdication obliged him to be much on the reserve to turn and wind about as he saw occasion in order not to make William III an usurper Had these two writers adopted true principles all these difficulties would have vanished and they would have written consistently in such a case however they could only in sober sadness have told the truth and would have paid their court only to the people Now to tell the truth is not the way to make a fortune nor are ambassadors appointed or places and pensions given away by the populace  CHAP III Whether the general Will can be in the wrong  IT follows from what has been said that the general Will is always in the right and constantly tends to the public good it does not follow however that the deliberations of the people will always be attended with the same rectitude We are ever desirous of our own good but we do not always distinguish in what it consists A whole people never can be corrupted but they may be often mistaken and it is in such a case only that they appear to seek their own disadvantage  There is often a considerable difference between the will of all the members and the general will of the whole body the latter regards only the common interest the other respects the private interest of individuals and is the aggregated sum of their particular wills but if we take from this sum those contradictory wills that mutually destroy each other  Each interest  says the Marquis d'A  has different principles A coalition between two particular interests may be formed out of opposition to that of a third  He might have added that a coalition of all is formed out of opposition to the interest of each Were there no different and clashing interests that of the whole would be hardly distinguishable as it would meet with no obstacle All things would go regularly on of their own accord and civil policy would cease to be an art  the sum of the remaining differences is the general will  If a people sufficiently informed of the nature of the subject under their consideration should deliberate without having any communication with each other the general will would always result from the greater number of their little differences and their deliberation would be such as it ought to be But when they enter into cabals and form partial associations at the expence of the general one the will of each of these associations becomes general with regard to the particular members of each and in itself particular with regard to the state In such a case therefore it may be said there is no longer as many voters as individuals but only as many voices as there are associations The differences then become less numerous and give a less general result Again should one of these partial associations be so great as to influence all the rest the result would no longer be the sum of many little differences but that of one great one in which case a general will would no longer subsist  It is requisite therefore in order that each resolution may be dictated by the general will that no such partial societies should be formed in a state and that each citizen should think for himself  Vera cosa é says Machiavel che alcuni divisioni nuocono alle republiche e alcune giovano quelle nuocono che sono dalle sette e da partigiani accompagnate quelle giovano che senza sette senza partigiani si man  engo  o Non potendo adunque provedere un fondatore d'una republica che non siano nimicizie in quella hà da proveder almeno che non visiano sette Hist Florent l vii  Such was the sublime institution of the great Lycurgus But if such partial societies must and will exist it is then expedient to multiply their number and prevent their inequality as was done by Solon Numa and Servius These are the only salutary precautions that can be taken in order that the general will may be properly informed▪ and the people not be mistaken as to their true interest  CHAP IV Of the limits of the sovereign power  IF the state or the city be a mere moral person whose life depends on the union of its members and if the most important of its concerns be that of its own preservation it  should certainly be possessed of an universal compulsive force to move and dispose each part in such a manner as is most conducive to the good of all As nature hath given every man an absolute power over his limbs to move and direct them at pleasure so the social compact gives to the body politic an absolute power over all its members and it is this power which directed by the general will bears the name as I have already observed of the sovereignty  But besides this public person we are to consider farther the private persons of which it is composed and whose life and liberty are naturally independent of it We come now therefore to make a proper distinction between the respective privileges of the citizens and the sovereign  Be not in haste attentive reader to accuse me here of contradiction I cannot avoid the seeming contradiction in terms from the native poverty of the language But have a little patience  as well as between the obligations the former lie under as subjects and the natural rights they claim as men  It is agreed that what an individual alienates of his power his possession or his liberty by the social compact is only such parts of them whose use is of importance to the community  but it must be confessed also that the sovereign is the only proper judge of this importance  A citizen is bound to perform all the services he can possibly be of to a state whenever the sovereign demands them but the sovereign on his part cannot require any thing of the subject that is useless to the community he cannot even be desirous of so doing for under the laws of reason nothing can be produced without a cause any more than under the law of nature  The engagements in which we are bound to the body of society are obligatory only because they are mutual and their nature is such that we cannot in discharging them labour for the good of others without at the same time labouring for that of ourselves Wherefore indeed is it that the general will is always in the right and that all constantly desire the good of each unless it be because there is no one that does not appropriate the term  each  to himself and who does not think of his own interest in voting for that of all This serves to prove also that an equality of privilege and the notion of justice it produces are derived from that preference which each naturally gives himself and of course from the very nature of man that the  general will in order to be truly such ought to be so in its effect as well as in its essence that it ought to flow from all in order to be applicable to all and that it must lose its natural rectitude when it tends to any individual and determinate object because judging in such a case of what is foreign to ourselves we have no real principle of equity for our guide  In fact no sooner do we come to treat of a particular fact or privilege on a point which has not been settled by a general and prior convention than the affair becomes litigious It is a process in which the particulars interested are one party and the public the other but in which I see no law to decide nor judge to determine It would be absurd therefore in such a case to think of referring it to any express decision of the general will which could be no other than the decision of one of the very parties and therefore must be with regard to the other foreign and partial leaning to injustice and subject to error In the same manner also that a partial and particular will cannot represent the general will so the latter in its turn changes its nature when employed on a particular object and cannot in its general capacity pronounce concerning any particular man or fact Thus when the people of Athens for instance  took upon them to appoint or cashier their chiefs to decree honours to one and inflict pains and penalties on another and thus by numerous decrees exercised indiscriminately all the acts of government they had then properly speaking no general will at all the Athenian people in this case did not act in the capacity of sovereign but in that of magistrate This may appear contradictory to the common notions of things but I must be allowed time to explain mine  We may learn hence that the general will consists less in the number of votes than in the common interest that unites them for in this institution every one subjects himself necessarily to those conditions which he imposes on others hence the admirable conformity between interest and justice which stamps on public declarations that characteristic of equity which we see vanish in the discussion of particular subjects for want of that common interest which unites and makes the criterion of the judge the same with that of the party  In what manner soever we recur to the first principle we always arrive at the same conclusion  viz  that the social compact establishes such an equality among the citizens that all lay  themselves under the same obligations and ought all to enjoy the same privileges Thus from the very nature of this compact every act of sovereignty that is to say every authentic act of the general will is equally obligatory on or favourable to all the citizens without distinction in so much that the sovereign knows only the whole body of the nation but distinguishes none of the individuals who compose it What then is properly an act of sovereignty It is not an agreement made between a superior and an inferior but a convention between a whole body with each of its members which convention is a lawful one because founded on the social contract it is equitable because it is common to all it is useful because it can have no other object than the general good and it is solid and durable because secured by the public strength and the supreme power  When the submission of subjects is owing only to such conventions they pay in fact obedience to none but their own will and to ask how far the respective privileges of the sovereign and citizens extend is to ask merely how far the latter may enter into engagements with themselves  viz  each individual with all collectively and all collectively with each individual  Hence we see that the sovereign power absolute inviolable and sacred as it is neither does nor can surpass the bounds of such general conventions and that every man hath a right to dispose as he pleases of that liberty and property which the terms of such conventions have left to his own disposal so that the sovereign hath not any right to lay a greater burthen on one subject than on another because in such a case it becomes a particular affair in which the sovereign hath no power to act  These distinctions being once admitted it is so far from being true that there is any real renunciation on the part of individuals when they enter into the social compact that their situation becomes by means of that very compact much better than before as instead of making any alienation they only make an advantageous exchange of an uncertain and precarious mode of subsistence for a more settled and determinate one they exchange their natural independence for social liberty the power of injuring others for that of securing themselves from injury and their own natural strength which might be overcome by that of others for a civil power which the social union renders invincible Their very lives which they have by these means  devoted to the state are continually protected and even when they are obliged to expose themselves to death in its defence what do they more than render back to society what they have before received of it What do they more in risquing their lives for their country than they would have been obliged to do more frequently and with much greater danger in a state of nature when subject to inevitable outrages they would have been obliged to defend their means of subsistance at the hazard of their lives That every one lies under the obligation of fighting in defence of his country is true but then he is relieved by the laws from the necessity of fighting to defend himself And are not men gainers on the whole by running part of those risks for their common security which they must severally run for themselves were they deprived of that security  CHAP V On capital punishments  IT hath been asked how individuals having no right to dispose of their own lives can transmit that right to the sovereign The difficulty of resolving this question arises only from  its being badly expressed Every man hath an undoubted right to hazard his life for its preservation Was a man ever charged with suicide for throwing himself from the top of an house in flames in order to avoid being burnt Was it ever imputed as a crime to a man who might be cast away at sea that he knew the danger of the voyage when he embarked  The end of the social compact is the preservation of the contracting parties Such therefore as would reap the benefit of the end must assent to the means which are inseparable from some dangers and losses He that would preserve his life at the expence of others ought to risk it for their safety when it is necessary Now the citizen is no longer a judge of the danger to which the law requires him to be exposed but when the prince declares that the good of the state requires his life he ought to resign it since it is only on those conditions he hath hitherto lived in security and his life is not solely the gift of nature but a conditional gift of the state  The punishment of death inflicted on malefactors may be considered also in the same point of view it is to prevent our falling by the  hands of an assassin that we consent to die on becoming such ourselves We are so far from giving away our lives by this treaty that we enter into it only for our preservation as it is not to be presumed that any one of the contracting parties formed therein a premeditated design to get himself hanged  Add to this that every malefactor by breaking the laws of his country becomes a rebel and traitor ceasing from that time to be a member of the community and even declaring war against it In this case the preservation of the state is incompatible with his one of the two must perish and thus when a criminal is executed he doth not suffer in the quality of a citizen but in that of an enemy His trial and sentence are the evidence and declaration of his having broken the social compact and that of consequence he is no longer a member of the state Now as he had professed himself such at least by his residence it is right that he should be separated from the state either by banishment as a violator of the social compact or by death as a public enemy for such an enemy is not a moral personage he is a mere man and it is in this case only that the right of war takes place of killing an enemy  But it may be said the condemnation of a criminal is a particular act It is so and for that reason it does not belong to the sovereign it is an act for doing which the supreme power may confer the authority though it cannot exercise such authority itself My ideas on this subject are consistent though I cannot explain them all at once  It is to be observed however that the frequency of executions is always a sign of the weakness or indolence of government There is no malefactor who might not be made good for something Nor ought any person to be put to death even by way of example unless such as could not be preserved without endangering the community  With regard to the prerogative of granting pardons to criminals condemned by the laws of their country and sentenced by the judges it belongs only to that power which is superior both to the judges and the laws viz the sovereign authority Not that it is very clear that even the supreme power is vested with such a right or that the circumstances in which it might be exerted are frequent or determinate In a wellgoverned state there are but few executions  not because there are many pardoned but because there are few criminals Whereas when a state is on the decline the multiplicity of crimes occasions their impunity Under the Roman republic neither the Senate nor the Consuls ever attempted to grant pardons even the people never did this although they sometimes recalled their own sentence The frequency of pardons indicates that in a short time crimes will not stand in need of them and every one may see the consequence of such conduct But my reluctant heart restrains my pen let us leave the discussion of these questions to the just man who hath never been criminal and who never stood in need of pardon  CHAP VI On the law  HAVING given existence and life to the body politic by a social compact we come now to give it action and will by a legislature For the primitive act by which such body is formed determines nothing as yet with respect to the means of its preservation  Whatever is right and conformable to order is such from the nature of things independent  of all human conventions All justice comes from God who is the fountain of it but could we receive it immediately from so sublime a source we should stand in no need of government or laws There is indeed an universal justice springing from reason alone but in order to admit this to take place among mankind it should be reciprocal To consider things as they appear we find the maxims of justice among mankind to be vain and fruitless for want of a natural support they tend only to the advantage of the wicked and the disadvantage of the just while the latter observes them in his behavour to others but no body regards them in their conduct to him Laws and conventions therefore are necessary in order to unite duties with privileges and confine justice to its proper objects In a state of nature where every thing is common I owe nothing to those I have promised nothing I acknowlege nothing to be the property of another but what is useless to myself In a state of society the case is different where the rights of each are fixed by law  We come at length therefore to consider what is law So long as we content ourselves with the metaphysical idea annexed to this term we must talk unintelligibly and though we  should come to a definition of natural law we should not know thence any thing more of political law I have already said there can be no general will relative to a particular object In fact every particular object must be within or without the state If without a will that is foreign cannot with regard to it be general and if the object be within the state it must make a part of it in which case there arises between the whole and the part a relation that constitutes two separate beings one of which is the part and the whole wanting such part is the other But the whole wanting such part is not the whole and so long as that relation subsists there is no whole but only two unequal parts whence it follows that the will of the one is no longer general with regard to that of the other  But when a whole people decree concerning a whole people they consider only their whole body and if it then forms any relation it must be between the entire object considered in one point of view and the entire object considered in another point of view without any division of the whole In this case the matter of the decree is general as the will that decrees Such is the act which I call a law  When I say that the object of the laws is always general I mean that the law considers the subjects in a collective body and their actions abstractedly but never concerns itself with individual persons nor particular actions Thus the law may decree certain privileges but it cannot bestow them on particular persons the law may constitute several classes of citizens and assign even the qualities which may entitle them to rank in these classes but it cannot nominate such or such persons to be admitted therein It may establish a legal government and appoint an hereditary succession but it cannot make choice of a king nor appoint the royal family in a word every function that relates to an individual object doth not belong to the legislative power  Taking things in this light it is immediately seen how absurd it is to ask in whose power it is to make laws as they are acts of the general will or whether the prince be above the laws as he is but a member of the state Hence also it is plain the law cannot be unjust as nothing can be unjust to itself as also what it is to be free and at the same time subject to the laws as the laws are only the records of our own will  It is hence farther evident the law reuniting the universality of the will to that of its object that whatever an individual of what rank soever may decree of his own head cannot be a law indeed whatever the supreme power itself may ordain concerning a particular object is not a law but a simple decree it is not an act of the sovereignty but of the magistracy  I call every state therefore which is governed by laws a Republic whatever be the form of its administration for in such a case only it is the public interest that governs and whatever is public is something Thus every lawful government is republican  I do not here mean by the term republican either an aristocracy or democracy but in general every government influenced by the general will of the people which is the law To make a government legal it is not necessary that it should be confounded with the sovereign but that it should be the minister so that in this sense even a monarchy is a republic This will be more fully explained in the subsequent book  I shall explain hereafter what I mean by a government  The laws are strictly speaking only the conditions of civil society The people who submit  to them should therefore be the authors of them as it certainly belongs to the associating parties to settle the conditions on which they agree to form a society But how are they to be settled is it to be done by common consent or by a sudden inspiration hath the body politic an organ by which to make known its will who shall furnish it with the necessary prescience to form its determinations and to publish them beforehand or how shall it divulge them in the time of need how shall an ignorant multitude who often know not what they chuse because they seldom know what is for their good execute an enterprize so great and so difficult as that of a system of legislature A people must necessarily be desirous of their own good but they do not always see in what it consists The general will is always in the right but the judgment by which it is directed is not always sufficiently informed It is necessary it should see objects such as they are and sometimes such as they ought to appear it should be directed to the salutary end it would pursue should be secured from the seduction of private interests should have an insight into the circumstances of time and place and should be enabled to set the present and perceptible advantages of things against the distant and concealed evil  that may attend them Individuals often see the good which they reject the public is desirous of that which it is incapable to see Both stand equally in need of a guide the former should be compelled to conform their desires to reason and the latter should be instructed in the discovery of what it desires It is thus from the proper information of the public that there results an union of the understanding and the will in the body of society and thence the exact concurrence of its parts and in the end the greatest force of the whole Hence arises the necessity of a legislator  CHAP VII Of the genius and character of a legislator  TO investigate those conditions of society which may best answer the purposes of nations would require the abilities of some superior intelligence who should be witness to all the passions of men but be subject itself to none who should have no connection with human nature but should have a perfect knowlege of it a being in short whose happiness should be independent of us and who  would nevertheless employ itself about ours  Nation become famous only as their legislature declines The institution of Lycurgus made the Spartan happy for ages before they were famous in    It is the province of Gods indeed to make laws for men  The same argument which Caligula made use of in point of fact Plato himself employs in point of right when he goes about to define the civil or royal personage in treating of a king But if it be certain that a great prince is a personage rarely to be met with what is that of a great legislator The former hath nothing more to do than to follow the model designed by the latter The one is the mechanical genius who invents the machine the other only the workman who puts it into execution In the commencement of societies says Montesquieu it is the principal persons in republics which form their institution and afterwards it is the institution which forms the chiefs of republics  He who should undertake to form a body politic ought to perceive himself capable of working a total change in human nature of transforming every individual of himself a solitary  and independent being into a part of a greater whole from which such individual is to receive in one sense his life and existence he must be capable of altering the constitution of the man in order to strengthen it and to substitute a partial and moral existence in the room of that physical and independent existence which we receive from the hands of Nature In a word he must be able to deprive man of his natural abilities in order to invest him with foreign powers which he cannot make use of without the assistance of others The more such natural force is annihilated and extinct the greater and more durable are those which are acquired and the more perfect and solid is the social institution So that if each citizen be nothing and can effect nothing but by the existence and assistance of all the rest and that the force acquired by the whole body be equal or superior to the sum of the natural forces of all its individuals the legislature may be said to have reached the highest pitch of perfection it is capable to attain  The legislator is in every respect a most extraordinary person in a state If he be undoubtedly so on account of his genius he is not less so from his function Yet this is not that of the  magistrate or the sovereign That function which constitutes the republic doth not enter into its constitution It is on the contrary a particular and superior employment that hath nothing in common with human government for if he who hath the command over the citizens should not be entrusted with the command over the laws he who hath the power over the laws ought as little to have the power over the citizens for were it otherwise his laws being made instrumental to his passions would often serve to perpetuate his injustice and he could never prevent particular views from altering his system  When Lycurgus gave laws to his country he began by abdicating the throne It was the custom of most of the Grecian cities to entrust their establishment with strangers a custom that hath been often imitated by the modern republics of Italy that of Geneva did the same and found its account in it  Those who consider Calvin only as a theologist▪ know but little of his comprehensive genius The digest of our laws in which he had a considerable share do him as much honour as his religious system and what revolution soever time may effect in our public worship the memory of this great man will continue to be revered so long as patriotism and a sense of liberty survive among us  In the most  flourishing age of Rome that city suffered under flagitious acts of tyranny and beheld itself on the brink of ruin for having entrusted the sovereign power and the legislative authority in the same hands  Even the decemviri themselves however never assumed the right of passing any law merely on their own authority  Nothing that we propose  said they to the people  can pass into a law without your consent Be yourselves ye Romans the authors of those laws on which your happiness depends  The legislator therefore who digests the laws should have no right to make them pass for such nor indeed can the people though inclined to do it deprive themselves of that incommunicable right because according to the fundamental compact it is the general will only that is obligatory on individuals and it is impossible to be assured that any particular will is conformable to the general till it be submitted to on the free suffrage of the people I have said this before but perhaps have not unnecessarily repeated it  Thus in the business of a legislature we find two things apparently incompatible a design superior to human abilities carried into execution by an authority which is nothing  Another difficulty which merits attention is that wise men in talking their own language to the vulgar speak unintelligibly And yet there are many kinds of ideas which it is impossible to convey in the language of the people Views too general and objects too distant are equally beyond their comprehension the individual relishing no other plan of government than that which is conducive to his private interest is with difficulty brought to see those advantages which are to be deduced from the continual checks he may receive from salutary laws In order to give a newlyformed people a taste for the sound maxims of policy and induce them to follow the fundamental rules of society it is necessary that the effect should in a manner become the cause that the spirit of union which should be the effect of social institutions should preside to form that institution itself and that men should be such before the laws are made as the laws are designed to make them For this reason therefore the legislator being capable of employing neither force nor argument  he is of necessity obliged to recur to an authority of an higher order which may compel without violence and persuade without conviction Hence it is that the founders of nations have been obliged in all ages to recur to the intervention of celestial powers and have honoured their gods with their own wisdom in order that the people by submitting themselves to the laws of the state in the same manner as to those of nature and acknowleging the same power in the formation of the city as in the formation of man might bend more freely and bear more tractably the yoke of obedience and public felicity  Now the determinations of that sublime reason which soars above the comprehension of vulgar minds are those which the legislator puts into the mouths of his immortal personages in order to influence those by a divine authority which could not be led by maxims of human prudence It does not belong to every man however to make the gods his oracles nor even to be believed when he pretends to be their interpreter The comprehensive genius of the legislator is the miracle that proves the truth of his mission Any man may engrave tables of stone hire an oracle pretend to a secret communication  with some deity teach a bird to whisper in his ear or hit upon other devices to impose on a people But he who knows nothing more though he may be lucky enough to get together an assembly of fools and madmen will never lay the foundations of an Empire the fabrick raised by his extravagance presently falling and often burying him in its ruins A transitory union may be formed from slight and futile connections nothing but the dictates of wisdom however can render it durable The Jewish law still subsisting and that of the son of Ismael which for ten centuries hath governed half the world are standing proofs of the superior genius of those great men by whom they were dictated and though the vanity of philosophy and the blind prejudice of party see nothing in their characters but fortunate impostors the true politician admires in their respective institutions that sagacious and comprehensive power of mind which must ever lay the lasting foundation of human establishments  It must not from all this be concluded however that religion and government have in our times as Warburton alleges one common object but only that in the first establishment of societies the one was made instrumental to the other  CHAP VIII Of the people  AS the architect before he begins to raise an edifice examines into the ground where he is to lay the foundation that he may be able to judge whether it will bear the weight of the superstructure so the prudent legislator does not begin by making a digest of salutary laws but examines first whether the people for whom such laws are designed are capable of supporting them It was for this reason Plato refused to give laws to the Arcadians and Cyrenians knowing they were rich and luxurious and could not admit of the introduction of equality among them It was for this reason that Crete though it boasted good laws was inhabited by such bad men Minos had only endeavoured to govern a people already depraved by vice Various have been the nations that have made a distinguished figure in the world and yet have not been capable of being governed by good laws and even those who were capable of being so governed continued so but a short time Nations as well as individuals are docile only in their infancy they  become incorrigible as they grow old When customs are once established and prejudices have taken root among them it is a dangerous and fruitless enterprize to attempt to reform them A people cannot even bear to have their wounds probed though in order to be cured but resemble those weak and cowardly patients who shudder at the sight of their physician Not but that sometimes as there are distempers which affect the brain of individuals and deprive them of the capacity of remembering what is past there happen in states such revolutions as produce the same effect on a people when the horror of the past supplies the place of oblivion and the state inflamed and exhausted by civil wars rises again if I may so express myself out of its own ashes and reassumes the vigour of youth in forsaking the arms of death This was the case with Sparta in the time of Lycurgus and of Rome after the Tarquins and such hath been the case in modern times with Holland and Switzerland after the expulsion of their tyrants But these events are rare and are such exceptions as have their cause in the particular constitution of the state excepted They cannot even take place twice among the same people for though they may be made free when they are only barbarous and  uncivilized yet when the resources of society are exhausted they cannot be renewed In that case faction may destroy but revolutions cannot reestablish their freedom they require for ever after a master and not a deliverer Every free people therefore should remember this maxim that tho' nations may acquire liberty yet if once this inestimable acquisition is lost it is absolutely irrecoverable  There is in nations as well as individuals a term of maturity at which they should be permitted to arrive before they are subjected to laws This term however is not always easy to be known and yet if it be anticipated it may be of dangerous consequence Again one people may be formed to discipline in their infancy while another may not be ripened for subjection till after many centuries The Russians for instance will never be truly polished because they were disciplined too soon Peter had only an imitative turn he had nothing of that true genius whose creative power forms things out of nothing Some of his measures indeed were proper enough but most of them were illtimed or illplaced He saw that his subjects were mere barbarians but he did not  see that they were not ripe for being made polite He wanted to civilize them when he should only have checked their brutality He wanted to make them at once Germans and Englishmen whereas he ought to have begun by making them first Russians and thus he prevented his subjects from ever becoming what otherwise they might have been by persuading them they were such as they were not It is thus a French tutor forms his pupil to make a figure in his childhood and to make none for ever afterwards The Empire of Russia while it is ambitious of reducing all Europe to its subjection will be subjected itself Its neighbours the Tartars will in time become both its masters and ours This event seems to me inevitable all the monarchs in Europe seeming to act in concert to accelerate such a revolution  CHAP IX The subject continued  IN the same manner as nature hath limited the dimensions of a wellformed human body beyond which she produces only giants or dwarfs so in the body politic there are  limits within or beyond which a state ought not to be confined or extended to the end that it may not be too big to be well governed nor too little to maintain its own independency There is in every body politic a  maximum  of force which it cannot exceed and from which it often recedes by extending its dominion The more the social knot is extended the more lax it grows and in general a little state is always proportionably stronger than a great one  A thousand reasons might be given in support of this maxim In the first place the administration of government becomes always more difficult as the distance from the seat of it increases even as a body has the greatest weight at the end of the longest lever It becomes also more burthensome in proportion as it is divided into parts for every town hath first its own particular government to pay that of each district again is paid by the same people next that of the province then that of particular governments with their viceroys all of whom are to be paid as they rise in dignity and always at the expence of the unhappy people whom last of all the supreme administration itself crushes with the whole weight of its oppression It is impossible so many  needless charges should not tend continually to impoverish the people who so far from being better governed by these different ranks of superiors are much worse so than if they had but one order of governors in the state And yet with this multiplicity of rulers they are far from being furnished with proper resources for extraordinary occasions but on the contrary when they have occasion to recur to them the state is always on the brink of ruin  Nor is this all the government not only becomes less vigorous and active in putting the laws in execution removing private oppression correcting abuses or preventing the seditious enterprises of rebellion in distant provinces but the people have less affection for their chiefs whom they never have an opportunity to see for their country which to them is like the whole world and for their fellowsubjects of which the greater part are utter strangers The same laws cannot be convenient for so many various people of different manners and climates and who cannot be supposed to live equally happy under the same form of government And yet different laws must occasion  much trouble and confusion among people who living under the same administration and carrying on a perpetual intercourse frequently change their habitations intermarry with each other and being educated under different customs hardly ever know when their property is secure Great talents lie buried virtue lives obscured and vice prevails with impunity amidst that multitude of strangers which flock together round the chief seat of administration The principals overwhelmed with a multiplicity of business can look into nothing themselves the government of the state being left to their deputies and clerks In a word the measures to be taken in order to maintain the general authority on which so many distant officers are ever ready to encroach or impose engross the public attention there is none of it left to be employed about the happiness of the people and indeed hardly any for their defence in case of need thus it is that a body too unwieldy for its constitution grows debilitated and sinks under its own weight  On the other hand a state ought to be fixed on some basis to secure its solidity to be able to resist those shocks which it will not fail to encounter and to make those efforts which it  will find necessary to maintain its independence▪ Nations have all a kind of centrifugal force by which they act continually against each other and tend like the vortices of Descartes to aggrandize themselves at the expence of their neighbours Thus the weak run in danger of being presently swallowed up by the strong nor is there any security for them but by keeping themselves in equilibrio with the rest and making the compression on every side equal  Hence we see it is prudent in some cases to extend and in others to restrain the limits of a state nor is it one of the least arts in civil polity to distinguish between one and the other and to fix on that advantageous proportion which tends most to the preservation of the state It may be observed in general that the reasons for extending dominion relating to objects external and relative ought to be subordinate to those for contracting it whose objects are internal and absolute A sound and vigorous constitution is the first thing to be considered and a much greater reliance is to be made on a good government than on the resources which are to be drawn from an extensive territory  Not but that there have been instances of states so constituted that the necessity of their making conquests hath been essential to their very constitution It is possible also they might felicitate themselves on that happy necessity which pointed out nevertheless with the summit of their grandeur the inevitable moment of their fall  CHAP X The subject continued  THE magnitude of a body politic may be taken two ways viz by the extent of territory and the number of the people a certain proportional relation between them constituting the real greatness of a state It is the people which form the state and the territory which affords subsistence to the people this relation therefore exists when the territory is sufficient for the subsistence of the inhabitants and the inhabitants are as numerous as the territory can maintain In this proportion consists the  maximum  of the force of any given number of people for if the territory be too extensive the defence of it is burthensome the cultivation insufficient and the produce superfluous  hence the proximate causes of defensive war If on the other hand the territory be too small the state is under the necessity of being obliged for part of its subsistence to its neighbours hence the proximate causes of offensive war Every people who by their situation have no other alternative than commerce or war must be necessarily feeble they must depend on their neighbours on adventitious circumstances and can only have a short and uncertain existence They must conquer others and thereby change their situation or be conquered themselves and thence be reduced to nothing It is impossible such a state can preserve its independency but by its insignificancy or its greatness  It is not easy to calculate the determinate relation between the extent of territory and number of inhabitants sufficient for each other not only on account of the difference in the qualities of the soil in its degrees of fertility in the nature of its productions and in the influence of climate but also on account of the remarkable difference in the temperament and constitution of the inhabitants some consuming but little in a fertile country and others a great deal on a barren soil Regard must also be had to  the degree of fecundity among the females to the circumstances favourable or destructive to population and to the number of people which the legislator may hope to draw from other countries by the advantages attending his scheme of government so that he ought not to found his judgment on what actually exists but on what he foresees may exist hereafter not on the present state of population but on that which will naturally succeed In fine there are a thousand occasions on which local accidents acquire or permit a state to possess a larger share of territory than may appear actually necessary for present use Thus a people may spread themselves over a large spot in a mountainous country whose natural produce of wood or pasture requires less labour of cultivation where experience teaches us that women are more fruitful than in the flat countries and in which a large inclined superficies gives but a small horizontal base by which only the land must be estimated in the affair of vegetation A people on the contrary may inhabit a less space on the seashore or even among rocks and almost barren sands because the fishery supplies them with sustenance instead of the produce of the earth they can easily disburthen their community by sending  out colonies of its supernumerary inhabitants and lastly because it is necessary for them in such a case to live near to each other in order to repel the invasions of pyrates  We may add to these conditional precautions respecting the formation of a people one that can be supplied by no other but without which all the rest are useless this is that they should enjoy peace and plenty For the time in which a state is forming resembles that in which soldiers are forming a battalion it is the moment in which they are least capable of resistance and the most easily defeated They would even make a greater resistance when put into absolute disorder afterwards than during the interval of their first fermentation when each is taken up more about his own particular rank than the common danger Should a war a famine or a rebellion break out at such a crisis the state would be infallibly subverted  Not but there have been many governments established in times of disorder and confusion in such cases however those very governments subverted the state Usurpers have always given rise to or took the advantage of those times of general confusion in order  to procure such destructive laws which the people never could have been prevailed on to pass at a more dispassionate season The choice of the proper time for the institution of laws is one of the most certain tokens by which we may distinguish the design of a legislator from that of a tyrant  If it be asked then what people are in a situation to receive a system of laws I answer those who though connected by some primitive union either of interest or compact are not yet truly subjected to regular laws those whose customs and prejudices are not deeply rooted those who are under no fear of being swallowed up by a sudden invasion and who without entering into the quarrels of their neighbours are able to encounter separately with each or to engage the assistance of one to repel the other a people whose individuals may be known to each other and among whom it is not necessary to charge a man with a greater burthen than it is possible for him to bear a people who can subsist without others and without whom all others might subsist  If two neighbouring people were so situated that one could not subsist without the other the circumstances of the first would be very hard and of the latter very dangerous Every wise nation in such a case would extricate itself as soon as possible from such a state of dependence The republic of Thlascala situated in the heart of the Mexican empire chose rather to be without salt than purchase it or even receive it gratis of the Mexicans The prudent Thlascalans saw through the snare of such liberality Thus they preserved their liberty this petty state included within that great empire being in the end the cause of its ruin  a people neither  rich nor poor but possessed of a competence within themselves a people in short who possess at once the consistency of an ancient nation and the docility of a newlycreated one The great difficulty in legislation consists less in knowing what ought to be established than what ought to be eradicated and what renders it so seldom successful is the impossibility of finding the simplicity of nature in the wants of society It is true that all these circumstances are very rarely united and it is for this reason that so few states have much to boast of in their constitution There is still one country in Europe capable of receiving laws this is the island of Corsica The valour and constancy with which those brave people recovered and have defended their liberty  might deservedly excite some wise man to teach them how to preserve it I cannot help surmising that this little island will one day or other be the astonishment of Europe  CHAP XI Of the various systems of legislature  IF we were to enquire in what consists precisely the greatest good or what ought to be the end of every system of legislature we should find it reducible to two principal objects  liberty  and  equality  liberty because all partial dependence deprives the whole body of the state of so much strength equality because liberty cannot subsist without it  I have already explained the nature of social liberty and with regard to equality we are not to understand by that term that individuals should all absolutely possess the same degree of wealth and power but only that with respect to the latter it should never be exercised contrary to good order and the laws and with respect to the former that no one citizen should be rich enough to buy another and that none should be so poor as to be obliged to sell himself  Would you give a state consistency and strength prevent the two extremes as much as possible let there be no rich persons nor beggars These two conditions naturally inseparable are equally destructive to the commonwealth the one furnishes tyrants and the other the supporters of tyranny It is by these the traffic of public liberty is carried on the one buying the other selling it  This supposes a moderation of possessions and credit on the side of the great and the moderation of desires and covetousness on the part of the little  This equality they tell us is a mere speculative chimera which cannot exist in practice but though abuses are inevitable does it thence follow they are not to be corrected It is for the very reason that things always tend to destroy this equality that the laws should be calculated to preserve it  These general objects of legislature however should be variously modified in different countries agreeable to local situation the character of the inhabitants and those other circumstances which require that every people should have a particular system of laws not always the best in itself but the best adapted to  that state for which it is calculated If for example the soil be ungrateful and barren or the country too small for its inhabitants cherish industry and the arts the productions of which may be exchanged for the commodities required On the other hand if your country abounds in fertile hills and plenteous vales if you live on a rich soil in want of inhabitants apply yourselves to agriculture which affords the means of population and banish the destructive arts which serve only to ruin a country by gathering the few inhabitants of it together in one particular spot or two to the depopulation of all the rest  The advantage of foreign commerce says the Marquis d'A is productive only of a delusive utility to the kingdom in general It may enrich a few individuals and perhaps some cities but the whole nation gains nothing by it nor are the people the better for it  Do you occupy an extensive and commodious situation by the sea side Cover the ocean with your ships cultivate the arts of navigation and commerce you will by these means enjoy a brilliant but short existence On the contrary do the waves only waste their strength against your inaccessible rocks Remain barbarous and illiterate you will live but the more at ease perhaps more virtuous assuredly  more happy In a word besides the maxims common to all nations every people are possessed in themselves of some cause which influences them in a particular manner and renders their own system of laws proper only for themselves It is thus that in ancient times among the Hebrews and in modern times among the Arabians religion was made the principal object of national concern among the Athenians this object was literature at Carthage and Tyre it was commerce at Rhodes it was navigation at Sparta war and at Rome public virtue The author of the  Spirit of laws  hath shewn by a number of examples in what manner the legislator should model his system agreeable to each of these objects  What renders the constitution of a state truly solid and durable is that agreement maintained therein between natural and social relations which occasions the legislature always to act in concert with nature while the laws serve only to confirm and rectify as it were the dictates of the former But if the legislator deceived in his object should assume a principle different from that which arises from the nature of things should the one tend to slavery and the other to liberty one to riches the other to population  one to peace the other to war and conquests the laws would insensibly lose their force the constitution would alter and the state continue to be agitated till it should be totally changed or destroyed and nature have resumed its empire  CHAP XII On the division of the laws  IN order to provide for the government of the whole or give the best possible form to the constitution various circumstances are to be taken into consideration Of these the first is the action of the whole body operating on itself that is the relation of the whole to the whole or of the sovereign to the state which relation is composed of those between the intermediate terms as will be seen hereafter  The laws which govern this relation bear the name of politic laws and are also called fundamental laws not without some reason when they are wisely ordained For if there be only one good method of government in a state the people who have been so happy as to hit on that method ought to abide by it but wherefore  should a people whose laws are bad or defective esteem such laws to be fundamental Besides a nation is in any case at liberty to change even the best laws when it pleases for if a people have a mind even to do themselves an injury who hath any right to prevent them  The second circumstance is the relations which the members of the community bear to each other and to the whole body the first of which should be as little and the last as great as possible so that every citizen should live in a state of perfect independence on all the rest and in a state of the greatest dependence on the city Both these are ever effected by the same means for it is the power of the state only that constitutes the liberty of its members On this second kind of relation is laid the immediate foundation of the civil laws  It may be proper to consider also a third species of relation between the individual and the law which gives immediate rise to penal statutes these however are in fact less a distinct species of laws than the sanction of all the others  To these three kinds of laws may be added a fourth more important than all the rest and which are neither engraven on brass or marble but in the hearts of the citizens forming the real constitution of the state These are the laws which acquire daily fresh influence and when others grow old and obsolete invigorate and revive them these are the laws which keep alive in the hearts of the people the original spirit of their institution and substitute insensibly the force of habit to that of authority The laws I here speak of are manners customs and above all public opinion all unknown or disregarded by our modern politicians but on which depends the success of all the rest These are the objects on which the real legislator is employed in secret while he appears solely to confine himself to those particular regulations which compose only the preparatory centre of the vault of which manners more slow in their progress form in the end the immoveable arch  Of these classes politic laws or those which constitute the form of government are relative only to my present subject  The END of the SECOND BOOK  BOOK III  BEFORE we enter on a discussion of the several forms of government it will not be improper to ascertain the precise meaning of that term which as yet hath not been well explained  CHAP I On government in general  I MUST previously caution the reader to peruse this chapter very deliberately as it is impossible to render myself clearly intelligible to such as are not attentive  Every free action hath two causes which concur to effect its production the one moral viz the will which determines the act the other physical viz the power which puts it in execution When I walk for instance toward any particular object it is first necessary that I should will to go and secondly that my feet should bear me forward A paralytic may will to run and an active racer be unwilling the want of power in the one hath the same effect  as the want of will in the other both remain in their place The body politic hath the same principles of motion which are distinguished also in the same manner by power and will the latter under the name of the  legislative  power and the former under that of the  executive  power Nothing is or ought to be done without the concurrence of both  We have already seen that the legislative power belongs to the people in general and can belong to none else On the other hand it is easy to conclude from the principles already established that the executive power cannot appertain to the generality as legislator or sovereign because this power is exerted only in particular acts which are not the province of the law nor of course that of the sovereign whose acts can be no other than laws  To the public force therefore should be annexed a proper agent which may reunite and put it in action agreeable to the directions of the general will serving as a communication between the state and the sovereign and effecting the same purpose in the body politic as the union of the soul and body in man Such is the rationale of government so generally confounded  with the sovereign of which it is only the ministry  What then is government It is an intermediate body established between the subject and the sovereign for their mutual correspondence charged with the execution of the laws and with the maintenance of civil and political liberty  The members of which this body is composed are called magistrates or  kings  that is to say  governors  and the whole body bears the name of the  prince  Thus at Venice the college of senators is called the most serene  prince  even when the doge is not present  Those therefore who affirm that the act by which a people profess submission to their chiefs or governors is not a contract are certainly right it being in fact nothing more than the conferring a simple commission on the said chiefs an employ in the discharge of which they act as mere officers of the sovereign exercising in its name the power which it hath placed in their hands and which it may limit modify or resume whenever it pleases the alienation of its right so to do being incompatible with the very nature and being of society  I call therefore the legal exercise of the executive power the  Government  or supreme administration and the individual or body charged with that administration the prince or the magistrate  In the government are to be found those intermediate forces whose relations compose that of the whole to the whole or of the sovereign to the state This last relation may be represented by that of the extremes of a constant proportion the mean proportional of which is the government The government receives from the sovereign those orders which it gives to the people so that in order to keep the state in due equilibrio there should every thing considered be the same equality between the momentum or force of the government taken in itself and the momentum or force of the citizens who are the sovereign considered collectively on one side and subjects considered severally on the other  It is besides impossible to vary any of these three terms without instantly destroying the proportions If the sovereign should be desirous to govern or the magistrate to give laws or the subjects refuse to obey disorder must immediately  take place the will and the power thus no longer acting in concert the state would be dissolved and fall into despotism or anarchy Add to this that as there can be but one mean proportional between each relation there can be but one good government for a state But as a thousand events may change the relations subsisting among a people different governments may not only be good for different people but even for the same people at different periods of time  In order to give the reader an idea of the various relations that may exist between these two extremes I shall by way of example make use of the number of people as a relation the most easily expressed  We will suppose for instance that a state is composed of ten thousand citizens The sovereign must be considered as collectively only and in a body but every particular in quality of subject is considered as an individual thus the sovereign is in this case to the subject as ten thousand to one That is to say every member of the state shares only the ten thousandth part of the sovereign authority while at the same time he is subjected to it in his whole person Again should the number of people be increased  to an hundred thousand the submission of the subjects would receive no alteration each of them being totally subjected to the authority of the laws while his share in the sovereignty and vote in the enaction of these laws would be reduced to the hundredthousandth part a tenth less than before Thus the subject remaining always a single integer the proportion between him and the sovereign increases as the number of citizens is augmented whence it follows that as a state increases the liberty of the subject diminishes  When I say the proportion increases I mean that it recedes farther from the point of equality Thus the greater the proportion in the language of the geometricians it is reckoned the less according to common acceptation agreeable to the former the relation considered in point of quantity is estimated by its extent and according to the latter considered in point of identity it is estimated by its proximation  Now the less proportion which particular voices bear to the general that is to say the manners to the laws the more ought the general restrictive force to be augmented Thus the government should be relatively more powerful as the people are more numerous  On the other hand the increasing greatness of a state affording the guardians of the public authority greater temptations and means to abuse their power the more force a government is possessed of to restrain the people the more ought the sovereign to be possessed of in its turn to restrain the government I am not speaking here of absolute power but of the relative forces of the component parts of the state  It follows from this twofold relation that the constant proportion between the sovereign the prince and the people is not a mere arbitrary idea but a necessary consequence of the very existence of the body politic It follows also that one of the extremes  viz  the people as subjects being a fixed term represented by unity wherever the twofold ratio is increased or diminished that the simple ratio must increase or diminish in like manner and of course the mean term will be changed Hence it appears there is no one settled constitution of government but that there may be as many governments different in their nature as there are states differing in magnitude  If any one should affect to turn my system into ridicule and say that in order to find this mean proportional and form the government as it ought to be we have no more to do than to find the square root of the number of the people I answer that I here make use of the number of people only by way of example that the relations of which I have been speaking are not only estimated by the number of individuals but in general by the momentum or quantity of action which arises from a combination of various causes and though in order to express myself concisely I borrow the terms of geometry I am not ignorant that geometrical precision is not to be expected in treating of moral quantities  The government is in miniature what the body politic containing it is at large It is a moral person endued with certain faculties active as the sovereign passive as the state and capable of being resolved into other sensible relations from which of course arises a new scale of proportion and still another within this according to the order of the courts of justice till we arrive at the last indivisible term that is to say the sole chief or supreme magistrate which may be represented in the centre  of this progression as an unity between the series of fractions and that of whole numbers  But without embarrassing the reader with a multiplicity of terms we shall content ourselves with considering the government as a new body in the state distinct from the subjects and the sovereign and existing between both  There is this essential difference however between the government and the state that the latter exists of itself and the former only by means of the sovereign Thus as the ruling will of the prince is or ought to be only the general will or the law the power of the prince is only that of the public centered in him so that whenever he would derive from himself any absolute and independent act the combination of the whole is affected And if at length the prince should have a particular will of his own more active than that of the sovereign and should make use of the public power in his hands to enforce obedience to such particular will forming as it were two sovereigns▪ the one of right and the other of fact the social union immediately vanishes and the body politic is dissolved  In order that the body of government nevertheless may have an existence a real life to distinguish it from that of the state and that its members may act in concert to answer the end for which it is instituted it is necessary that it should be possessed of a particular identity a sensibility common to all its members a power and will of its own for the sake of its preservation Such a particular existence necessarily supposes that of assemblies and councils of a power to deliberate and resolve of the rights titles and privileges which belong exclusively to the prince and render the situation of a magistrate the more honourable in proportion as it is more laborious The difficulty lies in the method of disposing all the inferior parts of the whole body so that while it is strengthening its own constitution it may not injure that of the state At the same time also it should always distinguish between the peculiar force destined to its own preservation and the public force destined to the preservation of the state in a word it should be always ready to sacrifice the government to the people and not the people to the government  To this we may add that although the artificial body of government be the work of another  artificial body and is possessed only of a borrowed and subordinate existence this doth not prevent it from acting with different degrees of vigour and celerity or from enjoying if I may so express myself a greater or less share of health and strength In short it may without running diametrically opposite to the purposes of its institution deviate from them more or less according to the mode in which it is constituted  It is from all these differences that arise those various relations and proportions which the government ought to bear toward the state according to these accidental and particular relations in which the state is modified For the best government in itself may often become the worst if the relation of its component parts are not altered according to the defects of the body politic to which it belongs  CHAP II On the principle which constitutes the different forms of government  TO explain the general cause of these differences it is necessary to distinguish here between the prince and the government in the same manner as I have already done between the sovereign and the state The body of the magistracy may be composed of a greater or a less number of members It hath been observed also that the relation the sovereign bears to the subject increases in proportion to the number of people thus by an evident analogy we may say the same of the relation between the government and the magistrates  Now the total force of the government being always equal to that of the state suffers no alteration whence it follows that the more such force is spent by the distribution of it among the members of the government the less remains to be exerted on the whole body of people  That government therefore which is in the hands of the greatest number of magistrates must be the most feeble As this is a fundamental maxim we shall take some pains to illustrate it  In the person of the magistrate may be distinguished three wills essentially different In the first place the particular will of the individual which tends only to his private advantage secondly that will which is common to him as a magistrate tending solely to the advantage of the prince being general with respect to the government and particular with regard to the state of which the government is only a part and in the third place the will of the people or the sovereign will which is general as well with regard to the state considered as a whole as with regard to the government considered as a part of that whole  In a compleat system of legislature the particular will or that of the individual should amount to nothing the will of the body of government should be very limited and of course the general or sovereign will the ruling and sole director of all the others  According to the order of nature however these different wills are ranged in a contrary manner being always more active as they are concentrated in themselves Thus the general will is always the most feeble that of the government next and the will of the individual the strongest of all so that each member of the administration is to be considered first of all as an individual secondly as a magistrate and lastly as a citizen a gradation directly opposite to that which the order of society requires  This point being settled let us suppose the administration of government committed to the hands of one man In this case the will of the individual and that of the body of the magistracy are perfectly united and of consequence the latter possesses the greatest degree of intensity Now as it is on the degree of the will that the exertion of force depends and as the absolute force of the government never varies it follows that the most active of all administrations must be that of a single person  On the contrary if we unite the administration and the legislature if we make the prince  the sovereign and the citizens all so many magistrates in this case the will of the government confounded with the general will would possess no greater share of activity but would leave the particular will of individuals to exert its whole force Thus the government having always the same degree of absolute force would be at its  minimum  of relative force or activity  These relations are incontestible and may be farther confirmed by other considerations It is evident for example that the magistrate is more active in that capacity than the citizen in his and that of course the will of the individual must have a more considerable share of influence in the administration of government than in the actions of the sovereign every magistrate being almost always charged with some function of government whereas no citizen considered as an individual discharges any function of the sovereignty Beside this the real force of a state increases as the state increases in magnitude though not always in the ratio of that magnitude but while the state remains the same it is in vain to increase the number of magistrates as the government will not thereby acquire any additional strength  because its force being always that of the state is constantly equal And thus the relative force or activity of government is diminished without its real and absolute force being augmented  It is farther certain that public affairs must be transacted more or less expeditiously according to the number of people charged with their dispatch that by laying too great a stress on prudence too little is trusted to fortune that the opportunity of success is thus frequently lost and that by the mere force of deliberation the end of it is defeated  This may serve to prove that the reins of government are relaxed in proportion as the magistrates are multiplied and I have before demonstrated that the more numerous the people are the more should the restraining power of government be increased Hence it follows that the proportion which the number of magistrates should hold to the government should be in the inverse ratio of the subjects to the sovereign that is to say the more extensive the state the more contracted should be the government the number of chiefs diminishing as that of the people increases  I speak here only of the relative force of the government and not of the rectitude or propriety of it For otherwise it is certain that the more numerous the magistracy is the nearer doth the will of that body approach to the general will of the whole people whereas under a sole chief the will of the magistracy is as I have before observed only that of an individual Thus what is gained in one respect is lost on the other and the art of the legislator consists in tracing the fixed point at which the force and the will of the government always in a reciprocal proportion to each other unite in that proportion which is most advantageous to the state  CHAP III Of the actual distinctions of governments  WE have treated in the preceding chapter of the reasons for distinguishing the several species and forms of government by the number of the members composing them it remains therefore to shew in the present how these distinctions are actually made  The sovereign authority may in the first place commit the charge of the government to the whole people or to the greater part of them the number of magistrates in such case exceeding that of private citizens This form of government is distinguished by the name of a democracy  Or otherwise the supreme power may commit the office of government into the hands of a few so that the number of private citizens may exceed that of magistrates and this form bears the name of an aristocracy  Or lastly the government may be entrusted to one magistrate only who delegates his power to all the rest This third form is the most common and is called a monarchy or a regal government  It is to be observed that all these forms and particularly the two former are susceptible of different degrees of perfection and admit indeed of considerable latitude in their modification for a democracy may comprehend the whole people or be limited to the half An aristocracy also may comprehend any quantity  from the half of the people to the smallest number indefinitely Nay a monarchy itself is susceptible of some distribution Sparta for instance had constitutionally two kings at a time and the Romans had even eight emperors at once without the empire having been actually divided Thus we see there is a certain point at which each form of government is confounded with that to which it is nearest related and thus under three distinguishing denominations only government is really susceptible of as many different forms as there are citizens in the state  To go still farther as even one and the same government is capable in many respects of being subdivided into parts of which the administration may respectively differ there may result from the varied combinations of these forms a multitude of others every one of which may be again multiplied by all the simple forms  Politicians have in all ages disputed much about the best form of government without considering that each different form may possibly be the best in some cases and the worst in others  If in different states the number of supreme magistrates should be in the inverse ratio to that of the citizens it follows that the democratical government is generally speaking better suited to small states the aristocratical to middling states and the monarchical to great states This rule is deduced immediately from our principles but it is impossible to particularize the multiplicity of circumstances which may furnish exceptions against it  CHAP IV Of a Democracy  THE institutor of a law should certainly know better than any other person how it ought to be understood and executed It should seem therefore that the best constitution must be that in which the legislative and executive powers are lodged in the same hands It is this very circumstance however that renders such a government imperfect because there doth not exist the necessary distinction which ought to be made in its parts while the prince and the sovereign being one and the same person only form if I may so express myself a government without a government  It is not proper that the power which makes the laws should execute them or that the attention of the whole body of the people should be diverted from general views to particular objects Nothing is more dangerous than the influence of private interest in publick affairs the abuse of the laws by the government being a less evil than the corruption of the legislature which is infallibly the consequence of its being governed by particular views For in that case the state being essentially altered all reformation becomes impossible A people who would not abuse the power of government would be no more propense to abuse their independence and a people who should always govern well would have no occasion to be governed at all  To take the term in its strictest sense there never existed and never will exist a real democracy in the world It is contrary to the natural order of things that the majority of a people should be the governors and the minority the governed It is not to be conceived that a whole people should remain personally assembled to manage the affairs of the public and it is evident that no sooner are deputies or representatives appointed than the form of the administration is changed  It may be laid down indeed as a maxim that when the functions of government are divided among several courts that which is composed of the fewest persons will sooner or later acquire the greatest authority though it were for no other reason than the facility with which it is calculated to expedite affairs  Such a form of government supposes also the concurrence of a number of circumstances rarely united In the first place it is requisite that the state itself should be of small extent so that the people might be easily assembled and all personally known to each other Secondly the simplicity of their manners should be such as to prevent a multiplicity of affairs and perplexity in discussing them And thirdly there should subsist a great degree of equality between the rank and fortunes of individuals without which there cannot exist long any equality between them in point of right and authority Lastly there should be little or no luxury for luxury must either be the effect of wealth or it must make it necessary it corrupts at once both rich and poor the one by means of the possession of wealth and the other by means of the want of it Luxury makes a sacrifice of  patriotism to indolence and vanity it robs a state of its citizens by subjecting them to each other and by subjecting all to the influence of public prejudice  It is for this reason that a certain celebrated author hath laid down virtue as the first principle of a republican government for all these circumstances cannot concur without the existence of public virtue For want however of making proper distinctions this great genius hath been led into frequent mistakes as well as want of precision not having observed that the sovereign authority being every where the same the same principle must take place in every well constituted state though it is true in a greater or less degree according to the form of government  To this it may be added that no government is so subject to civil wars and intestine commotions as that of the democratical or popular form because no other tends so strongly and so constantly to alter nor requires so much vigilance and fortitude to preserve it from alteration It is indeed in such a constitution particularly that the citizen should always be armed  with force and constancy and should repeat every day in the sincerity of his heart the saying of the virtuous palatine  The Palatine of Posnania father of the king of Poland Duke of Lorrain    Malo peni  l sam libertat  m quam quietum servitium  Did there exist a nation of Gods their government would doubtless be democratical it is too perfect a form however for mankind  CHAP V Of an Aristocracy  IN this form of government exist two moral persons very palpably distinct viz the administration and the sovereign which of course possess two general wills the one regarding the citizens universally the other only the members of the administration Thus although the government may regulate the interior police of the state as it pleases it cannot address the people but in the name of the sovereign that is to say the people themselves which is a circumstance never to be omitted The primitive societies of mankind were governed aristocratically  The heads of families deliberated among themselves concerning public affairs the young people readily submitting to the authority of experience Hence the names of  Priests  the  Fathers  the  Senate  c The savages of North America are governed in the same manner to this day and are extremely well governed  But in proportion as the inequality arising from social institutions prevailed over natural inequality riches and power were preferred to age  It is evident that the term  optimates  among the ancients did not mean the best but most powerful  and the aristocracy became elective At length power transmitted with property from father to son making whole families patrician rendered the government hereditary and boys of twenty became senators  Aristocracy therefore is of three kinds natural elective and hereditary The first is applicable only to the most simple state of society while the last is the worst of all kinds of government The second is the best and is what is most properly denominated an aristocracy  Beside the advantage of the abovementioned distinction this form hath also that of the choice of its members in a popular government all the citizens are born magistrates but in this the number of the latter are very limited and they become such only by election  It is of great importance to regulate by law the method of chusing magistrates for in leaving this to the prince it is impossible to avoid falling into an hereditary aristocracy as happened to the republics of Venice and Berne Hence the first has been long since dissolved but the second hath been supported by the great prudence of the Senate This is an exception however as dangerous as honourable  a method by which their probity their talents their experience and all those other reasons for preference in the public esteem are an additional security that the people shall be wisely governed  Again their public assemblies are attended with more decorum affairs of state are more regularly discussed and business executed with greater order and expedition while the credit of the state is better supported in the eyes of foreigners by a select number of venerable senators than by a promiscuous or contemptible mob  In a word that order would be undoubtedly the best and most natural according to which the wise and experienced few direct the multitude were it certain that the few would in their government consult the interest of the majority governed and not their own It is absurd to multiply the springs of action to no purpose or to employ twenty thousand men in doing that which an hundred properly selected would effect much better  With regard to the particular circumstances requisite to this form of government the state should not be so small nor the manners of the people so simple or so virtuous as that the execution of the laws should coincide with the public Will as in a well founded democracy On the other hand also the state should not be so extensive that the governors distributed up and down its provinces might be able to render themselves each in his separate department independant of the sovereign  But if an aristocracy requires fewer virtues than a popular government there are yet some which are peculiar to it such as moderation in the rich and content in the poor an exact equality  of condition would in such a government be quite improper nor was it observed even at Sparta  If a certain degree however of inequality in the fortunes of the people be proper in such a government the reason of it is that in general the administration of public affairs ought to be put into the hands of those persons who can best devote their time to such service not as Aristotle pretends that the rich ought always to be preferred merely on account of their wealth On the contrary it is very necessary that an opposite choice should sometimes teach the people that there exist other motives of preference much more important than riches  CHAP VI On monarchy  HITHERTO we have considered the prince as a moral and collective personage formed by the force of the laws and as the depository of the executive power of the state At present it is our business to consider this power as lodged in the hands of a physical personage or real man possessed of the right of  exerting it agreeable to the laws Such a person is denominated a monarch or king  In other administrations it is common for a collective body to represent an individual being whereas in this an individual is on the contrary the representative of a collective body so that the moral unity which constitutes the prince is at the same time a physical unity in which all the faculties which the law combines in the former are combined naturally in the latter  Thus the will of the people and that of the prince together with the public force of the state and the particular force of the government all depend on the same principle of action all the springs of the machine are in the same hand are exerted to the same end there are no opposite motions counteracting and destroying each other nor is it possible to conceive any species of government in which the least effort is productive of so great a quantity of action Archimedes sitting at his ease on the shore and moving about a large vessel on the ocean at pleasure represents to my imagination an able monarch sitting in his cabinet and governing his distant provinces by keeping every thing in  motion while he himself seems immoveable But if no other kind of government hath so much activity there is none in which the particular will of the individual is so predominant Every thing it is true proceeds toward the same end but this end is not that of public happiness and hence the force of the administration operates incessantly to the prejudice of the state  Kings would be absolute and they are sometimes told that their best way to become so is to make themselves beloved by the people This maxim is doubtless a very fine one and even in some respects true But unhappily it is laughed at in courts That power which arises from the love of the people is without doubt the greatest but it is so precarious and conditional that princes have never been satisfied with it Even the best kings are desirous of having it in their power to do ill when they please without losing their prerogatives It is to no purpose that a declaiming politician tells them that the strength of the people being theirs it is their greatest interest to have the people flourishing numerous and respectable they know that this is not true Their personal and private interest  is in the first place that the people should be so weak and miserable as to be incapable of making any resistance to government I confess indeed that supposing the people to be held in perfect subjection it would be to the interest of the prince that they should be rich and powerful because their strength being also his serves to make him respectable to his neighbours but as this interest is only secondary and subordinate and that these suppositions are incompatible it is natural for princes to give the preference always to that maxim which is the most immediately useful This is what Samuel hath represented very forcibly to the Hebrews and Machiavel hath made evident to a demonstration In affecting to give instructions to kings he hath given the most striking lessons to the people His book entitled the Prince is particularly adapted to the service of Republics  We have already shewn from the general relations of things that a monarchy is suitable only to great states and we shall be more particularly convinced of it on a further examination The more numerous the members of the public administration the more is the relation beween the prince and the subjects diminished and the  nearer it approaches to nothing or that point of equality which subsists in a democracy This relation increases in proportion as the government is contracted and arrives at its  maximum  when the administration is in the hands of a single person In this case then there is too great a distance between the prince and people and the state is void of connection To supply its place therefore recourse is had to the intermediate ranks of people Hence the several orders of nobility But nothing of this kind is suitable to a small state to which these different ranks are very destructive  If the good government of a state be a matter of difficulty under any mode of administration it is more particularly so in the hands of a single person and every body knows the consequences when a king reigns by substitutes  Again there is one essential and unavoidable defect which will ever render a monarchical government inferior to a republic and this is that in the latter the public voice hardly ever raises unworthy persons to high posts in the administration making choice only of men of knowlege and abilities who discharge their respective  functions with honour whereas those who generally make their way to such posts under a monarchical government are men of little minds and mean talents who owe their preferment to the meritricious arts of flattery and intrigue The public are less apt to be deceived in their choice than the prince and a man of real merit is as rarely to be found in the ministry of a king as a blockhead at the head of a republic Thus when by any fortunate accident a genius born for government takes the lead in a monarchy brought to the verge of ruin by such petty rulers the world is amazed at the resources he discovers and his administration stands as a singular epoch in the history of his country  To have a monarchical state well governed it is requisite that its magnitude or extent should be proportioned to the abilities of the regent It is more easy to conquer than to govern By means of a lever sufficiently long it were possible with a single finger to move the globe but to support it requires the shoulders of an Hercules When a state may with any propriety be denominated great the prince is almost always too little And when on the contrary it happens which however is very seldom  that the state is too little for its regent it must be ever illgoverned because the chief actuated by the greatness of his own ideas is apt to forget the interest of his people and makes them no less unhappy from the abuse of his superfluous talents than would another of a more limited capacity for want of those talents which should be necessary It is thence requisite that a kingdom should if I may so say contract and dilate itself on every succession according to the capacity of the reigning prince whereas the abilities of a senate being more fixt the state under a republican government may be confined or extended to any determinate limits and the administration be equally good The most palpable inconvenience in the government of a sole magistrate is the default of that continued succession which in the two other kinds forms an uninterrupted connection in the state When one king dies it is necessary to have another but when kings are elective such elections form very turbulent and dangerous intervals and unless the citizens are possessed of a disinterestedness and integrity incompatible with this mode of government venality and corruption will necessarily have an influence over them It is very rare that he  to whom the state is sold does not sell it again in his turn and make the weak repay him the money extorted from him by the strong Every one becomes sooner or later venal and corrupt under such an administration while even the tranquillity which is enjoyed under the kings is worse than the disorder attending their  interregnum    To remedy these evils crowns have been made hereditary and an order of succession hath been established which prevents any disputes on the death of kings that is to say by substituting the inconvenience of regencies to that of elections an apparent tranquillity is preferred to a wise administration and it is thought better to run the risk of having the throne supplied by children monsters and ideots than to have any dispute about the choice of good kings It is not considered that in exposing a state to the risk of such an alternative almost every chance is against it  Almost every thing conspires to deprive a youth educated to the command over others of the principles of reason and justice Great pains it is said are taken to teach young princes the art  of reigning it does not appear however that they profit much by their education It would be better to begin by teaching them subjection The greatest monarchs that have been celebrated in history are those who were not educated to govern This is a science of which those know the least who have been taught the most and is better acquired by studying obedience than command  Nam utillissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum delectus cogitare quid aut nolueris sub alio principe aut volueris  A consequence of this want of coherence is the inconstancy of regal government which is sometimes pursued on one plan and sometimes on another according to the character of the prince who governs or of those who hold the reins of administration for him so that its conduct is as inconsistent as the object of its pursuit is wavering It is this inconstancy which keeps the state ever fluctuating from maxim to maxim and from project to project an uncertainty which does not take place in other kinds of government where the prince is always the same Thus we see in general that if there be more cunning in a court there is more true  wisdom in a senate and that republics accomplish their ends by means more constant and better pursued while on the contrary every revolution in the ministry of a court produces one in the state it being the constant maxim with all ministers and almost with all kings to engage in measures directly opposite to those of their immediate predecessors Again it is from this very incoherence that we may deduce the solution of a sophism very common with regal politicians and this is not only the practice of comparing the civil government of society to the domestic government of a family and the prince to the father of it an error already exposed but also that of liberally bestowing on the reigning magistrate all the virtues he stands in need of and of supposing the prince always such as he ought to be With the help of this supposition indeed the regal government is evidently preferable to all others because it is incontestably the strongest and nothing more is required to make it also the best than that the will of the prince should be conformable to the general will of the people  But if according to Plato the king by nature is so very rare a personage how seldom may we suppose nature and fortune hath concurred to crown him If a regal education  also necessarily corrupts those who receive it what hopes can we have from a race of men thus educated It is a wilful error therefore to confound a regal government in general with the government of a good king But to see what this species of government is in itself it must be considered under the direction of weak and wicked princes for such they generally are when they come to the throne or such the throne will make them These difficulties have not escaped the notice of some writers but they do not seem to have been much embarrassed by them The remedy say they is to obey without murmuring God sends us bad things in his wrath and we ought to bear with them as chastisements from on high This way of talk is certainly very edifying but I conceive it would come with greater propriety from the pulpit than from the pen of a politician What should we say of a physician who might promise miracles and whose whole art should consist in preaching up patience and resignation It is obvious enough that we must bear with a bad government when we live under it the question is to find a good one  CHAP VII Of mixed Governments  THERE is no such thing properly speaking as a simple government Even a sole chief must have inferior magistrates and a popular government a chief Thus in the distribution of the executive power there is always a gradation from the greater number to the less with this difference that sometimes the greater number depends on the less and at others the less on the greater  Sometimes indeed the distribution is equal▪ either when the constituent parts depend mutually on each other as in the English government or when the authority of each part is independent though imperfect as in Poland This last form is a bad one because there is no union in such a government and the several parts of the state want a due connection  It is a question much agitated by politicians Which is best a simple or mixt government The same answer however might be given to it  as I have before made to the like question concerning the forms of government in general  A simple government is the best in itself though for no other reason than that it is simple But when the executive power is not sufficiently dependent on the legislative that is to say when there is a greater disproportion between the prince and the sovereign than between the people and the prince this defect must be remedied by dividing the government in which case all its parts would have no less authority over the subject and yet their division would render them collectively less powerful to oppose their sovereign  The same inconvenience is prevented also by establishing a number of inferior magistrates which tend to preserve a ballance between the two powers and to maintain their respective prerogatives In this case however the government is not properly of a mixt kind it is only moderated  The like means may also be employed to remedy an opposite inconvenience as when a government is too feeble by erecting of proper  tribunals to concentrate its force This method is practised in all democracies In the first case the administration is divided in order to weaken it and in the second to enforce it For a  maximum  both of strength and weakness is equally common to simple governments while those of mixt forms always give a mean proportional to both  CHAP VIII That every form of government is not equally proper for every country  AS liberty is not the produce of all climates so it is not alike attainable by all people The more one reflects on this principle established by Montesquieu the more sensible we become of its truth The more it is contested the more we find it confirmed by new proofs  Under every kind of government the political personage the public consumes much but produces nothing Whence then doth it derive the substance consumed Evidently from the labour of its members It is from the superfluity of individuals that the necessities of the public are provided Hence it follows  that a social state cannot subsist longer than the industry of its members continues to produce such superfluity  The quantity of this superfluity however is not the same in all countries It is in many very considerable in some but moderate in others null and again in others negative The proportion depends on the fertility of the climate the species of labour required in the cultivation of the soil the nature of its produce the strength of its inhabitants the consumption necessary to their subsistence with many other similar circumstances  On the other hand all governments are not of the same nature some devour much more than others and their difference is founded on this principle viz that the farther public contributions are removed from their source the more burthensome they grow It is not by the quantity of the imposition that we are to estimate the burthen of it but by the time or space taken up in its returning back to the hands from which it is exacted When this return is quick and easy it matters little whether such imposition be small or great the people are  always rich and the finances in good condition On the contrary however low a people be taxed if the money never returns they are sure by constantly paying to be soon exhausted such a state can never be rich and the individuals of it must be always beggars  It follows hence that the farther the people are removed from the seat of government the more burthensome are their taxes thus in a democracy their weight is least felt in an aristocracy they fall more heavy and in a monarchical state they have the greatest weight of all Monarchy therefore is proper only for opulent nations aristocracy for middling states and a democracy for those which are mean and poor  In fact the more we reflect on this circumstance the more plainly we perceive the difference in this respect between a monarchical and a free state In the latter all its force is exerted for the public utility in the former the public interest of the state and the private interest of the prince are reciprocally opposed the one increasing by the decrease of the other  In a word instead of governing subjects in such a manner as to make them happy despotism makes them miserable in order to be able to govern them at all  Thus may we trace in every climate those natural causes which point out that particular form of government which is best adapted to it as well as even the peculiar kind of people that should inhabit it Barren and ungrateful soils whose produce will not pay for the labour of cultivation would remain uncultivated and uninhabited or at best would be peopled only with savages Those countries from which the inhabitants might draw the necessaries of life and no more would be peopled by barbarians among whom the establishment of civil polity would be impossible Such places as might yield to their inhabitants a moderate superfluity would be best adapted to a free people while the country where fertile plains and plenteous vales more bounteously reward the labours of the cultivator would best suit with a monarchical form of government in order that the luxury of the prince might consume the superfluity of the subjects for it is much better that this superfluity should be expended by government than dissipated by individuals I am not insensible that some exceptions  might be made to what is here advanced these very exceptions however serve to confirm the general rule in that they are sooner or later constantly productive of revolutions which reduce things to their natural order  We should always make a distinction between general laws and those particular causes which may diversify their effects For though the southern climates should be actually filled with republics and the northern with despotic monarchies it would be nevertheless true in theory that so far as climate is concerned despotism agrees best with an hot barbarism with a cold and good polity with a temperate region I am aware farther that even granting the principle the application of it may be disputed It may be said that some cold countries are very fertile while others more warm and southern are very barren This objection however hath weight only with such as do not examine the matter in every point of view It is requisite to take into consideration as I before observed the labour of the people their strength their consumption with every other circumstance that affects the point in question  Let us suppose two countries of equal extent the proportion of whose product should be as five to ten It is plain that if the inhabitants of the first consume four and of the latter nine the superfluity of the one would be    and that of the other Their different superfluities being also in an inverse ratio to that of their produce the territory whose produce should amount only to five would have near double the superfluity of that which should amount to ten  But the argument does not rest upon a double produce nay I doubt whether any person will place the actual fertility of cold countries in general in a bare equality with that of warmer climates We will suppose them however to be in this respect simply equal setting England for instance on a balance with Sicily and Poland with Egypt Still farther to the South we have Africa and the Indies and to the North hardly any thing But to effect this equality in the produce what a difference in the labour of cultivation In Sicily they have nothing more to do than barely turn up the earth in England agriculture is extremely toilsome and laborious Now where a greater number of  hands is required to raise the same produce the superfluity must necessarily be less  Add to this that the same number of people consume much less in a warm country than in a cold one An hot climate requires men to be temperate if they would preserve their health Of this the Europeans are made sensible by seeing those who do not alter their manner of living in hot countries daily carried off by dysenteries and indigestion Chardin represents us as beasts of prey as mere wolves in comparison of the Asiatics and thinks those writers mistaken who have attributed the temperance of the Persians to the uncultivated state of their country His opinion is that their country was so little cultivated because the inhabitants required so little for their subsistence If their frugality were merely the effect of the barrenness of their country he observes it would be only the poorer sort of them that should eat little whereas their abstinence is general Again they would in such case be more or less abstemious in different provinces as those provinces differed in degrees of sterility whereas their sobriety is general and prevails equally throughout the kingdom He tells  us also that the Persians boast much of their manner of living pretending their complexions only to be a sufficient indication of its being preferable to that of the Christians At the same time he admits that their complexions are very fine and smooth that their skin is of a soft texture and polished appearance while on the other hand the complexion of the Armenians their subjects who live after the European manner is rough and pimply and their bodies gross and unwieldy  The nearer we approach to the line it is certain the more abstemious we find the people They hardly ever eat meat rice and maize are their ordinary food There are millions of people in the Indies whose subsistence does not amount to the value of a penny a day We see even in Europe a very sensible difference in this respect between the inhabitants of the North and South A Spaniard will subsist a whole week on what a German would eat up at a single meal In countries where the people are voracious even luxury hath a tendency to consumption Thus in England it displays itself in the number of dishes and quantity of solid meat on the table while in Italy a repast  is furnished out with sweetmeats and flowers  The luxury of dress presents us also with similar differences In climates where the change of the weather is sudden and violent the people wear better and plainer clothes while in those where the inhabitants dress only for ornament brilliancy is more consulted than use even clothes themselves are an article of luxury Thus at Naples you will daily see gentlemen walking about in laced clothes without stockings It is the same with regard to buildings magnificence only is consulted where nothing is to be feared from the inclemencies of the weather At Paris and London people are desirous of warm and commodious apartments At Madrid they have superb saloons but no sashes nor casements and their beds lie open to the rats that harbour in the roof  The aliment is also more substantial and nourishing in hot countries than in cold this is a third difference that cannot fail to have an influence over the second Wherefore is it that the Italians eat such a quantity of vegetables Because they are good and of an excellent savour In France  where they are themselves nourished chiefly by water they are less nutritive and are held of little consequence They occupy nevertheless as much ground and cost as much pains to cultivate them It hath been experimentally proved that the corn of Barbary in other respects inferior to that of France gives a greater quantity of meal and that the French corn yields still more than that of the North Hence it may be inferred that a similar gradation is carried on in the same direction from the line to the pole Now is it not an evident disadvantage to have in an equal produce a less quantity of aliment  To all these different considerations I may add another which arises from and serves to confirm them this is that hot countries require fewer inhabitants than the cold and yet afford subsistence for more a circumstance that causes a twofold superfluity always to the advantage of despotism The more the same number of people are distributed over the face of a large territory the more difficult becomes a revolt as they cannot meet together so readily or secretly and it is always easy for the government to cut off their associations and ruin their projects  On the other hand the more a numerous people are collected together the less can the government assume over the sovereign the chiefs of a faction may deliberate as securely at their meetings as the prince in his council and the mob are as readily assembled in the public squares as the troops in their quarters It is the advantage of a tyrannical government therefore to act at great distances its force increasing with the distance like that of a lever  This doth not contradict what is advanced in Chap ix Book II concerning the inconvenience of great states the matter in question there being the authority of the government over its members and here of its influence over the subjects Its members scattered about in different places serve as points of support to enable it to act at a distance on the people but it hath no such props to assist its action on its members themselves Thus in one ease the length of the lever is the cause of its strength and in the other of its weakness  by the assistance of a proper center That of the people on the contrary acts only by being concentrated it evaporates and loses itself when dilated even as gunpowder scattered on the ground takes fire particle by particle and is productive of no effect▪ Countries thinly inhabited  are the most proper places for tyrants wild beasts reign only in desarts  CHAP IX Of the marks of a good Government  WHEN it is asked therefore in general terms what is the best form of government the question is as indeterminate as unanswerable or rather it may be reasonably answered as many different ways as there are possible combinations of the absolute and relative circumstances of a people  But if it be asked by what signs it may be known whether any given people are well or ill governed This is quite another thing and the question as to the fact is to be resolved  This question however is never actually resolved because every one is for doing it after his own manner The subject cries up the public tranquillity the citizen the liberty of individuals the one prefers the security of property the other that of his person the one maintains the best government to be the most severe the other affirms that to be best which is most agreeable  the latter is for punishing crimes the former for preventing them the one thinks it a fine thing to be dreaded by his neighbours the other thinks it better to be unknown to them the one is satisfied if money does but circulate the other requires the people should have bread Were they even agreed also on these and other similar points they would not be much nearer the end of the dispute Moral quantities are deficient in point of precision so that were men agreed on the sign they would still differ about its estimation  For my part I am astonished that a sign so very simple should be mistaken or that any should be so disingenuous as not to acknowlege it What is the end of political society doubtless the preservation and prosperity of its members And what is the most certain sign or proof of these Certainly it is their number and population Let us not look elsewhere then for this disputed proof since it is plain that government must be the best under which the citizens increase and multiply most supposing all other circumstances equal and no foreigners naturalized or colonies introduced to cause such increase and that on the  contrary that government must be the worst under which  caeteris paribus  the number of people should diminish This being admitted the decision of the question becomes an affair of calculation  It is on the same principle that we ought to judge of the several  that deserve the preference in being distinguished for the prosperity of mankind We have in general too much admired those in which literature and the fine arts have flourished▪ without penetrating into the secret cause of their cultivation or duly considering their fatal effects  idque apud imper  s humanitas vocabatur cum  a  s servit  ti esset  Shall we never be able to see through the maxims laid down in books the interested  tives of their authorsNo let writers say what they will whenever the inhabitants of a country decrease it is not true that all things go well whatever be its external prosperity and splendour A poet possessed of an hundred thousand livres a year does not necessarily make the age he lives in the best of all others We should not so much regard the apparent repose of the world and the tranquillity of its chiefs as the wellbeing of whole nations and particularly of the most populous states A storm of hail may lay waste some few provinces but it seldom causes a famine Temporary tumults and civil wars may give much disturbance to rulers but they do not constitute the real misfortunes of a people who may even enjoy some respite while they are disputing who shall play the tyrant over them It is from their permanent situation that their real prosperity or calamity must arise when all submit tamely to the yoke then it is that all are perishing then it is that their chiefs destroying them at their ease  ubi s  litudinem faciunt pacem appellant  When the intrigues of the nobility agitated the kingdom of France and the coadjutor of Paris carried a poignard in his pocket to parliament all this did not hinder the bulk of the French nation from growing numerous and enjoying themselves in happiness and ease Ancient Greece flourished in the midst of the most cruel wars human blood was spilt in torrents and yet the country swarmed with inhabitants It appears says Machiavel that in the midst of murders proscriptions and civil wars our republic became only the more powerful the virtue of the citizens their manners their independence had a greater effect to strengthen it than all its dissentions had to weaken it A little agitation gives vigour to the mind and liberty not peace is the real source of the prosperity of our species  and as such I give it up to the arithmeticians  CHAP X Of the abuse of government and its tendency to degenerate  AS the particular will of the prince acts constantly against the general will of the people the government necessarily makes a continual effort against the sovereignty The greater this effort is the more is the constitution altered and as in this case there is no other distinct Will to keep that of the prince in equilibrio it must sooner or later infallibly happen  that the prince will oppress the sovereign and break the social compact This is an inherent and unavoidable defect which from the very birth of the political body incessantly tends to its dissolution even as old age and death tend to the dissolution of the natural body  There are two general methods according to which a government degenerates viz when it contracts itself or when the state is dissolved The government contracts itself when its members are reduced from a great number to a few that is to say from a democracy to an aristocracy and from an aristocracy to a royalty  This is its natural tendency  The slow formation and progress of the republic of Venice present a notable example of this succession and it is very surprising that in the space of years the Venetians should be got no farther than to the second term which began in the year With regard to the ancient dukes with which their constitution is reproached it is certain whatever some writers may say that they were not sovereigns  The Roman republic will doubtless be made an objection as having taken a contrary route in its progress from monarchy to aristocracy and from aristocracy to democracy I am however far from thinking this was the real case  The first establishment of Romulus was a mixt government which degenerated presently into despotism From very particular causes the state perished before its time as a new born infant before it attained the age of manhood The expulsion of the Tarquins was the true era of the rise of that republic although it did not assume at first a determinate form because the work was but half done in not having abolished the order of patricians For hence an hereditary aristocracy the worst of all administrations acting in opposition to the democracy the form of government remained indeterminate not being fixed as Machiavel observes till the establishment of the tribunes when and not before it was a real government under the form of a true democracy In fact the people were then not only sovereign but also magistrate and judge the senate being a tribunal of an inferior order formed to temper and collect the government while even the consuls themselves although patricians first magistrates and as generals absolute in the field yet at Rome they were only presidents of the assemblies of the people  From this time it is evident the government followed its natural byass and tended strongly toward aristocracy The patrician order dying away of itself the aristocracy subsisted no longer in the members of that body as at Venice and Genoa but in the body of the senate composed of Patricians and Plebeians and even in the body of tribunes when they began to usurp an active power For words make no alteration in things When the people have chiefs who govern in their stead whatever denomination be given to these chiefs the government is always an aristocracy From the abuse of the aristocratical form arose the civil wars and the triumvirate Sylla Julius Caesar and Augustus indeed became real monarchs and at length under the despotism of Tiberius the state was finally dissolved The Roman history therefore doth not tend to disprove my principle but to confirm it  Should it make a retrogressive change by having the number  of its members increased it might be said to relax or dilate itself but this inverse progress is impossible  In fact a government never changes its form except its spring of action be too much worn to support its own Now if it relaxes still more by being extended its force becomes absolutely  nothing and is still less capable of supporting itself It is necessary therefore to wind up and renew such spring in proportion as it gives way otherwise the state it is intended to support must necessarily fall  The dissolution of the state indeed may happen two ways First when the prince does not govern according to law but arrogates the sovereign power to himself in which case he effects a remarkable change whereby not the government but the state itself is contracted What I mean to say is that the great state is thence dissolved and that he forms another within it composed only of the members of the government who are only the masters and tyrants over the rest of the people So  that when the government usurps the sovereignty at that instant the social compact is broken and the individuals who were citizens before are restored to the rights of natural liberty and are compelled not legally obliged to obedience  It is the same thing when the members of government assume separately the power they are entitled to exercise only collectively which is no less an infringement of the laws and is productive of still worse consequences For in this case there may be said to be as many princes as magistrates while the state no less divided than the government is totally dissolved or changes its form  When the state is dissolved the abuse of government of whatever nature it be takes the common name of anarchy To distinguish more nicely  democracy  is said to degenerate into  ochlocracy aristocracy  into  oligarchy  and I may add  monarchy  into  tyranny  but this last term is equivocal and requires some explanation In the vulgar sense of the word a tyrant is a king who governs by force and without regard to justice or the laws In the more precise and determinate sense it means any individual  who assumes the royal authority without having a right to it In this latter sense the Greeks understood the word tyrant and give it indiscriminately both to good and bad princes whose authority was not legal  Omnes enim et habentur et dicuntur tyranni qui pot  state utuntur perpetuâ in eâ civitate quae libertate usa est  CORN NEPOS IN MILTIADE It is true that Aristotle makes a distinction between the tyrant and king in that the one governs for his own good and the other for the good of his subjects but besides that all the Greek writers use the word tyrant in a different sense as appears particularly by the Hieron of Zenophon it would follow from Aristotle's distinction that no king ever existed on the face of the earth  Thus  tyrant  and  usurper  are two words perfectly synonimous  To give different names however to different things I call the usurpation of regal authority  tyranny  and that of sovereign power  despotism  The tyrant is he who takes upon himself contrary to law to govern according to law and the despotic chief one who places himself above the laws themselves Thus a tyrant cannot be despotic though a despotic prince must always be a tyrant  CHAP XI Of the dissolution of the body politic  SUCH is the natural and unavoidable tendency of even the best constituted governments If Rome and Sparta perished what state can hope to last for ever In our endeavours to form a durable establishment we must not think therefore to make it eternal If we would hope to succeed we must not attempt impossibilities nor flatter ourselves to give that permanency to human institutions which is incompatible with their nature  The body politic as well as the physical begins to die at its birth and bears in itself the causes of its destruction Both however may possess a constitution more or less robust and adapted to different periods of duration The constitution of man is the work of nature that of the state is the work of art It doth not depend on men to prolong their lives but it depends on them to prolong that of the state as much as possible by giving it a constitution the best adapted to longevity The most perfect constitution it is true will have an end  but still so much later than others if no unforeseen accident bring it to an untimely dissolution  The principle of political life lies in the sovereign authority The legislative power is the heart of the state the executive power is the brain which puts every part in motion The brain may be rendered useless by the palsy and yet the individual survive A man may become an insensible driveller and yet live but as soon as the heart ceases to beat the animal is dead  The state doth not subsist by virtue of the laws but by the legislative power The statutes of yesterday are not in themselves necessarily binding to day but the tacit confirmation of them is presumed from the silence of the legislature the sovereign being supposed incessantly to confirm the laws not actually repealed Whatever is once declared to be the will of the sovereign continues always so unless it be abrogated  Wherefore then is there so much respect paid to ancient laws Even for this reason It is rational to suppose that nothing but the  excellence of the ancient laws could preserve them so long in being for that if the sovereign had not found them always salutary and useful they would have been repealed  Hence we see that the laws instead of losing their force acquire additional authority by time in every well formed state the prepossession of their antiquity renders them every day more venerable whereas in every country where the laws grow obsolete and lose their force as they grow old this alone is a proof that the legislative power itself is decayed and the state extinct  CHAP XII By what means the sovereign authority is maintained  THE sovereign having no other force than the legislative power acts only by the laws while the laws being only the authentic acts of the general will the sovereign cannot act unless the people are assembled The people assemble you will say What a chimera It is indeed chimerical at present though it was not reckoned so two thousand  years ago Are mankind changed in their nature since that time  The bounds of possibility in moral affairs are less confined than we are apt to imagine It is our foibles our vices our prejudices that contract them Mean souls give no credit to the sentiments of heroic minds while slaves affect to turn the notion of liberty into ridicule  By what hath been done however we may judge of what may be done again I shall not speak of the petty republics of ancient Greece but the Roman republic was undoubtedly a great state and the city of Rome a great city By the last register of the citizens of Rome their number amounted to four hundred thousand persons capable of bearing arms and the last register of the Empire amounted to more than four millions of citizens without reckoning subjects women children or slaves  How very difficult you will say must it have been to assemble frequently the people of that capital and its environs And yet hardly a week passed in which the Roman people were not assembled and on some occasions several times  a week This numerous body indeed not only exercised the functions of sovereignty but also in some cases those of government They sometimes deliberated on state affairs and at others decided in judicial causes the whole people being publicly assembled almost as frequently in the capacity of magistrates as citizens  By recurring to the primitive state of nations we shall find that most of the ancient governments even the monarchical as that of the Macedon and others had the like popular assemblies Be this however as it may the fact being once incontestibly proved obviates all difficulties for to deduce the possibility of a thing from its having actually happened will admit of no objection  CHAP XIII The subject continued  IT is not enough however that the people once assembled should fix the constitution of the state by giving their sanction to a certain code or system of laws it is not enough that they should establish a perpetual government or provide once for all by the election of magistrates Besides the extraordinary assemblies which unforeseen accidents may require it is necessary they should have certain fixed and periodical meetings which nothing might abolish or prorogue so that the people should on a certain day be legally summoned by law without any express statute being required for their formal convocation  But excepting these regular assemblies rendered legal by the date all others unless convoked by the proper magistrate previously appointed to that end agreeable to prescribed forms should be held illegal and all their determinations declared null and void because the very manner of the people's assembling should be determined by law  As to the frequency of legal assemblies it depends on so many different considerations that it is impossible to lay down any precise rules on this head It can only be said in general that the more powerful the government the more often ought the sovereignty to display itself  All this it may be said is very well for a single town or city but what must be done in a state comprehending several cities Must the sovereign authority be distributed or ought it to centre in one to the total subjection of the rest  I answer neither one nor the other In the first place the sovereign authority is simple and uniform so that it cannot be divided without destroying it In the next place one city cannot be legally subject to another any more than one nation to another because the essence of the body politic consists in the union of obedience and liberty and in the terms  subject  and  sovereign  being those identical correlatives the ideas of which are united in the single term  citizen    I answer farther that it is fundamentally wrong to unite several towns to form one city and that such union being made the natural inconveniences of it must ensue The abuses peculiar to great states must not be made objections to the system of one who maintains the exclusive propriety of little ones But how it will be said can little states be made powerful enough to resist the greatEven as the cities of ancient Greece were able to resist the arms of a powerful monarch and as in more modern times Switzerland and Holland have resisted the power of the house of Austria  In cases also where the state cannot be reduced within proper bounds there remains one resource and this is by not permitting the existence of a capital but removing the seat of government from one town to another and assembling the states of the country in each alternately  People a country equally in every part diffuse the same privileges and advantages throughout and the state will become at once the strongest and the best governed Remember that the walls of cities are founded on the ruins of the villages and that the splendid palaces  in town are raised at the expence of miserable▪ cottages in the country  CHAP XIV Subject continued  NO sooner are the people legally assembled in a sovereign body than the jurisdiction of government ceases the executive power of the state is suspended and the person of the meanest citizen becomes as sacred and inviolable as the greatest magistrate because when the body represented appears it is not requisite that the representatives of it should exist Most of the tumults which happened in the  Comitia  at Rome were owing to the general ignorance or neglect of this rule On those occasions the consuls were only presidents of the assembly of the people the tribunes merely orators  Nearly in the sense given to those who speak on any question in the parliament of England The resemblance of their employments set the consuls and tribunes together by the ears even when their jurisdiction was suspended  and the senate absolutely nothing  These intervals of suspension when the prince acknowleges or at least ought to acknowlege  an actual superior have been always formidable while such formidable assemblies the security of the body politic and the restraint of government have been held in honour by the chiefs so that they never have been sparing of pains in raising objections and difficulties or of making fair promises in order to disgust the citizens with such meetings When the latter therefore have been avaritious mean or cowardly preferring their case to liberty they have not been able to withstand long the repeated efforts of government and thus it is that this encroaching power incessantly augmenting the sovereignty becomes totally extinct and thus most cities come to an untimely end  Sometimes however there is introduced between sovereign authority and arbitrary government a mean term of power of which it is necessary to treat  CHAP XV Of deputies or representatives  WHEN the service of the public ceases to be the principal concern of the citizens and they had rather discharge it by their purses than their persons the state is already far advanced toward ruin When they should march out to fight they pay troops to fight for them and stay at home When they should go to council they send deputies and stay at home Thus in consequence of their indolence and wealth they in the end employ soldiers to enslave their country and representatives to betray it  It is the bustle of commerce and the arts it is the sordid love of gain of luxury and ease that thus convert personal into pecuniary services Men readily give up one part of their profit to increase the rest unmolested But supply an administration with money and they will presently supply you with chains The very term of  taxes  is slavish and unknown in a free city In a state truly free the citizens discharge their duty to the public with their  own hands and not by money So far from paying for being exempted from such duty they would pay to be permitted to discharge it themselves I am very far from adopting received opinions and think the services exacted by force a less infringement of liberty than taxes  The better the constitution of a state the greater influence have public affairs over private in the minds of the citizens They will have also much fewer private affairs to concern them because the sum total of their common happiness furnishing a more considerable portion to each individual there remains the less for each to seek from his own private concerns In a city well governed every one is ready to fly to its public assemblies under a bad government they are careless about going thither at all because no one interests himself in what is doing there it is known that the general will does not influence  hem and hence at length domestic concerns engage all their attention Good laws tend to the making better while bad ones are introductory of Worse No sooner doth a citizen say what are stateaffairs to me than the state may be given up for lost  It is this want of public spirit the influence of private interest the extent of states conquests and abuses in government that have given rise to the method of assembling the people by deputies and representatives The assembly of these representatives is called in some countries the third estate of the nation so that the particular interests of the two orders are placed in the first and second rank and the public interest only in the third  The sovereignty however cannot be represented and that for the same reason that it cannot be alienated It consists essentially of the general will and the will cannot be represented it is either identically the same or some other there can be no mean term in the case The deputies of the people therefore neither are nor can be their representatives they are only mere commissioners and can conclude definitively on nothing Every law that is not confirmed by the people in person is null and void it is not in fact a law The English imagine they are a free people they are however mistaken they are such only during the election of members of parliament When these are chosen they become slaves again and indeed they make so bad a use of the few  transitory moments of liberty that they richly deserve to lose it  The notion of representatives is modern descending to us from the feudal system that most iniquitous and absurd form of government by which human nature was so shamefully degraded In the ancient republics and even monarchies the people had no representatives they were strangers to the term It is even very singular that at Rome where the Tribunes were so much revered it was never imagined they could usurp the functions of the people and as strange that they never once attempted it One may judge however of the embarrassment sometimes caused by the multitude by what happened in the time of the Gracchi when part of the citizens gave their votes from their housetops  Where men value their liberty and privileges above every thing inconveniences and difficulties are nothing Among this wise people things were held in a proper estimation they permitted the Lictors to do what they would not suffer the Tribunes to attempt they were not  afraid the Lictors would ever think of representing them  To explain nevertheless in what manner these Tribunes did sometimes represent them it will be sufficient to conceive how government represents the sovereign The law being only a declaration of the general will it is clear that the people cannot be represented in the legislative power but they may and ought to be in the executive which is only the application of power to law And this makes it evident that if we examine things to the bottom we shall find very few nations that have any laws But be this as it may it is certain that the Tribunes having no part of the executive power could not represent the Roman people by virtue of their office but only in usurping those of the senate  Among the Greeks whatever the people had to do they did it in person they were perpetually assembled in public They inhabited a mild climate were free from avarice their slaves managed their domestic business and their great concern was liberty As you do not possess the same advantages how can you expect  to preserve the same privileges Your climate being more severe creates more wants  To adopt in cold countries the luxury and effeminacy of the East is to appear desirous of slavery without having the same excuse for submitting to it  for six months in the year your public squares are too wet or cold to be frequented your hoarse tongues cannot make themselves heard in the open air you apply yourselves more to gain than to liberty and are less afraid of slavery than poverty  On this occasion it will probably be asked me if liberty cannot support itself without the assistance of slavery Perhaps not At least the two extremes approach very near Whatever does not exist in nature must have its conveniences and civil society still more than any thing else There are some circumstances so critically unhappy that men cannot preserve their own liberty but at the expence of the liberty of others and in which a citizen cannot be perfectly free without aggravating the subjection of his slaves Such was the situation of Sparta As for you ye moderns you have no slaves but are slaves yourselves and purchase  their liberty by your own You may if you please boast of this preference for my part I find more meanness in it than humanity  I do not intend however by this to inculcate that we should have slaves or that it is equitable to reduce men to a state of slavery having already proved the contrary I am here only giving the reasons why certain modern nations who imagine themselves free employ representatives and why the ancients did not But let this be as it will I affirm that when once a people make choice of representatives they are no longer free  Every thing duly considered I do not see a possibility of the sovereign maintaining its rights and the exercise of its prerogatives for the future among us unless the state be indeed very small But if it be so very small will it not be liable to lose its independency No I will make it hereafter appear in what manner the exterior power of a great people may be united with the policy and good order of a little one  CHAP XVI That the institution of government is not a compact  THE legislative power being once well established we proceed to settle the executive power in the same manner for the latter which operates only by particular acts being essentially different from the other is naturally divided from it If it were possible for the sovereign considered as such to possess the executive power the matter of right and fact would be so confounded that we should no longer be able to distinguish what is law and what is not the body politic also being thus unnaturally situated would soon become a prey to that violence which it was originally instituted to correct  The citizens being by virtue of the social compact all equal that which all may perform all may prescribe whereas none can have a right to require another to do what he does not himself Now it is properly this right indispensibly necessary to animate and put the body politic in motion with which the sovereign invests  the prince in the institution of government  It has been pretended by some that the act forming this institution was a contract between the people and the chiefs of which they made choice a contract in which the two parties stipulated the conditions on which the one obliged themselves to command and the other to obey I am persuaded every one will agree with me that this was a very strange mode of contract But let us see whether this opinion is in itself well founded  In the first place the supreme authority can no more modify or alter its form than it can alienate itself to limit or restrain would be to destroy it It is absurd and contradictory to say the sovereign made choice of a superior to oblige itself to obey a master is to dissolve its own constitution and restore its members to their natural liberty  Again it is plain that such a supposed contract between the people in general and certain particular persons would be a particular act whence it follows that it would not be a law  nor an act of sovereignty and of consequence would be illegal  It is farther evident that the contracting parties would remain respecting each other simply under the laws of nature without any security for the performance of their reciprocal engagements a circumstance totally repugnant to a state of civil society The party only who might have the power could enforce the execution of the terms so that we might as well give the name of a contract to the act of a man who should say to another "I give you my whole property on condition that you will restore me just as much of it as you please"  There is but one compact in a state and that is the act of association which alone is exclusive of every other as it is impossible to imagine any subsequent public contract which would not be a violation of the original  CHAP XVII Of the institution of government  WHAT notion then are we to form of the act by which government is instituted In answer to this question I shall first remark that this act is complicated or composed of two others viz the establishment of the law and the execution of it  By the first the sovereign enacts that a government shall be established in such or such a form and it is clear this being a general act that it is a law  By the second the people name the chiefs who are to be charged with the administration of the government so established Now this nomination being a particular act is not a second law but only a consequence of the first and in reality an act of government  The difficulty lies in being able to comprehend how an act of government can take place before the government existed and how the  people who must be always either sovereign or subjects become prince or magistrate in certain circumstances  We have here made a discovery of one of these astonishing properties of the body politic by which it reconciles operations apparently contradictory to each other this act being effected by a sudden conversion of the sovereignty into a democracy so that without any sensible change and only by means of a new relation of all to all the citizens becoming magistrates pass from general acts to particular ones and from enacting laws to the execution of them  This change of relation is not a matter of mere speculation unexemplified in practice it takes place very frequently in the parliament of England where among the commons the whole house is formed on certain occasions into a committee for the better enquiry into and discussion of the matter in hand the members become mere commissioners of the sovereign court they constituted but a moment before Agreeable to which the enquiry being ended they make a report to themselves as the house of Commons of their proceedings as a grand  committee and deliberate anew under the former title on what they had already determined under the latter  Such indeed is the peculiar advantage of a democratical government that it is established in fact by the simple act of the general will After which this provisional government continues if such be the intended form or establishes in the name of the sovereign the form of government adopted by law and thus every thing proceeds according to order It is impossible to institute a government in any other legal manner without renouncing the principles before established  CHAP XVIII Of the means of preventing the usurpations of government  FROM the foregoing illustrations results the confirmation of what is asserted in the XVIth chapter viz that the act which institutes government is not a contract but a law that the depositories of the executive power are  not the masters but the servants of the people that the people may appoint or remove them at pleasure that they have no pretence to a contract with the people but are bound to obey them and that in accepting the offices the state imposes on them they only discharge their duty as citizens without having any sort of right to dispute the conditions  When it so happens therefore that the people establish an hereditary government whether monarchical and confined to one particular family or aristocratical and divided among a certain order of citizens they do not enter thereby into any formal engagement they only give the administration a provisional form which remains legal till they think proper to change it  It is certain that such changes are always dangerous and that a government once established should not be meddled with unless it be found incompatible with the public good but this circumspection is a maxim of policy and not a matter of right The state however is no more bound to resign the civil authority  into the hands of its magistrates or chiefs than the military authority into those of its generals  It is certain also that great care should be taken to observe all those formalities which in such a case are requisite to distinguish a regular and legal act from a seditious commotion to distinguish between the general will of a whole people and the clamours of a faction In which latter case a people are particularly obliged to give the best founded remonstrances no farther countenance than in the utmost strictness of justice they may deserve Of this obligation however the prince may take great advantages in order to preserve his power in spite of the people without running the risk of being charged with usurping it For in appearing only to make use of his prerogatives he may extend them and under the pretence of maintaining the public peace may prevent those assemblies which might otherwise be calculated to reestablish the good order of government so that he might profit by that silence which he keeps from being broken and by those irregularities  which he himself might cause to be committed pleading in his favour the tacit approbation of those whose fears keep them silent and punishing those who are bold enough to speak It was thus the  decemviri  at first elected for one year only and afterwards continued for another attempted to perpetuate the duration of their power by preventing the  Comitia  from assembling as usual and it is by such easy means that all the governments in the world when once invested with power usurp sooner or later the sovereign authority  Those periodical assemblies of which I have spoken above are very proper to prevent or protract this misfortune particularly when they require no formal convocation for then the prince cannot prevent them without declaring himself openly a violator of the laws and an enemy to the state  The opening of these assemblies which have no other object than the preservation of the social contract ought always to be made by  two propositions which can never be suppressed and should pass separately by vote  FIRST Whether it be the determination of the sovereign to preserve the present form of government  SECOND Whether it be the determination of the people to continue the administration in the hands of those who are at present charged with it  It is to be observed that I here take for granted what I conceive has already been demonstrated viz that there is no fundamental law in any state which such state cannot repeal not excepting even the social compact for should all the citizens assemble with one accord to break this compact it would undoubtedly be very legally dissolved Grotius even thinks that an individual may renounce the state of which he is a member and resume his natural independence and property by leaving the country  With this exception however that he does not fly to elude his duty and avoid serving his country on any emergency when his service is required In this case his flight would be criminal and highly deserving of punishment It would not be a retreat but desertion  Now it would be  very absurd to suppose that the whole body of citizens united could not do that in concert which any one of them might do separately  The END of the THIRD BOOK  BOOK IV  CHAP I That the general will cannot be annihilated  SO long as a number of individuals remain perfectly united and consider themselves as one body they can have but one will which relates to their common preservation and welfare All the resources of the state are then simple and vigorous its political maxims clear and obvious it comprehends no intricate and opposite interests but that of the public is demonstrably evident to all and requires only the gift of common sense to understand it Peace concord and equality are enemies to political refinements When men are honest and simple their very simplicity prevents their deception they are not to be imposed on by sophistry but are too artless even to be duped When it is known that among the happiest people in the world a number of peasants meet together under the shade of an oak and regulate the affairs of state with the mo  prudential oeconomy is it possible to forbear despising  the refinements of other nations who employ so much artifice and mystery to render themselves splendidly miserable  A state thus simply governed hath need of but few laws while in proportion as it becomes necessary to promulgate new ones that necessity is universally apparent The first person who proposes them takes on himself to speak only what every one hath already thought and neither eloquence nor intrigue is requisite to make that pass into a law which every one had already resolved to do as soon as he should be assured others would do the same  That which deceives our reasoners on this subject is that seeing none but such states as were badly constituted at their beginning they are struck with the impossibility of maintaining such a police in them They smile to think of the absurdities into which a designing knave or insinuating orator might lead the people of Paris and London They are not apprized that a Cromwell and a Beaufort would have been treated as incendiaries at Berne and Geneva and have underwent the discipline due to their demerit  But when the bonds of society begin to relax and the state to grow weak when the private interests of individuals begin to appear and that of parties to influence the state the objects of public good meet with opposition unanimity no longer presides in the assemblies of the people the general will is no longer the will of all contradictions and debates arise and the most salutary counsel is not adopted without dispute  Again when the state is bordering on ruin and exists only in empty form when the social tie no longer connects the hearts of the people when the basest motives of interest impudently assume the sacred name of the public good then is the general will altogether silent individuals actuated by private motives cherish no more the sentiments of citizens than if the state had never existed while the mock legislature pass under the name of laws those iniquitous decrees which have no other end than private interest  Doth it follow from hence however that the general will is annihilated or corrupted No This remains ever constant invariable  and pure though it is subjected to that of party There is not an individual who doth not see while he detaches his own interest from that of the public that he cannot separate himself from it entirely but his share in the common evil seems nothing in comparison to the good which he proposes to secure exclusively to himself Setting this motive aside he is as ready to concur in measures for the good of the public and that even for his own sake as any one Nay even in selling his vote he doth not lose all sense of the general will he only eludes it The fault he is guilty of lies in changing the state of the question and making an answer to what is not asked him so that instead of admitting by his vote  that it is to the interest of the state  he says  it is to the interest of such an individual or such a party that this or that law should pass  Thus the order which should prevail in the public assemblies of the state should not be calculated so much to preserve the general will inviolate as to cause it to be always interrogated and to make it answer  I might here make a variety of reflections on the simple right of voting in every act of the sovereignty a right which the citizens cannot be deprived of as also on the rights of  thinking proposing and debating on public matters privileges which government is ever solicitous enough to confine to its own members This subject however is of importance enough to deserve a whole treatise of itself and it is impossible for me to say every thing in the present  CHAP II On Votes  IT is evident from what hath been said in the preceding chapter that the manner in which public affairs are carried on may afford a sure indication of the actual state of manners and the health of the body politic The more concord there is in public assemblies that is to say the nearer the members approach to unanimity in giving their votes the more prevalent is the general will among them but long debates▪ dissentions and commotions evince the ascendency of particular interests and the decline of the state  This appears less evident indeed when two or more orders of men enter into the constitution as at Rome where the quarrels of the  Patricians and Plebeians occasioned frequent disturbances in the  Comitia  even in the most flourishing times of the republic This exception however is more apparent than real as in that case there exists by a defect inherent in the body politic two states in one and that which is not true of both together may nevertheless be true of each apart It is also true in fact that even during the most turbulent times of the republic the decrees of the Plebeians when he Senate did not intermeddle were passed with great tranquillity agreeable to the plurality of voices The citizens having but one common interest the people could have but one will  Unanimity returns again at the opposite extremity of the circle and this is where the citizens reduced to slavery have neither liberty nor will In such a situation fear and flattery pervert their votes into acclamations they no longer deliberate among themselves but either adore or curse their tyrants Such were the debased principles of the Senate under the Roman emperors Under these circumstances also the sentiments of the public were frequently expressed with the most ridiculous precaution Tacitus observing that under Otho the  Senators while they loaded Vitellius with execrations they affected at the same time to make a confused and clamorous noise in order to prevent his knowing should he become their master what any individual had said  From these considerations may be deduced the maxims on which the manner of counting votes and comparing different suffrages should be regulated according as the general will is more or less easy to be discovered and the state more or less advanced towards its decline There is but one law which in its own nature requires unanimous consent and this is the social compact For civil association is the most voluntary act in the world every man being born free and master of himself no one can lay him under restraint on any pretence whatever without his own consent To affirm that the son of a slave is born a slave is to affirm he is not born a man  If there be any persons however who oppose this contract itself their opposition does not invalidate that contract it only hinders their being comprehended therein and they remain aliens in the midst of citizens When  a state is formed a consent to its institution is inferred by the residence of the party to submit to residence in any country is to submit to its sovereignty  This must always be understood however of a free state from which people have the liberty to depart with their effects at pleasure For in others the consideration of their family their property the want of an asylum necessity or violence may detain an inhabitant in a country contrary to his will in which case his simple residence neither implies his consent to the contract nor his violation of it    If we except this primitive contract the determination of the majority is always obligatory on the rest this is a necessary consequence of the contract itself But it may be asked how can a man be free and yet be obliged to conform to the will of others How can the members of an opposition be called freemen who are compelled to submit to laws which they have not consented to I answer that this question is not properly stated The citizen consents to all laws passed by a majority though some of them in particular may have passed contrary to his inclination nay he consents to those by which he is punishable for the breach of  any one The constant will of all the members of a state is the general will and it is this alone that makes them either citizens or freemen  At Genoa we see the word  Libertas  inscribed on the chains of the galley slaves and on the doors of the prisoners the application of which device is beautiful and just as it is in fact only the criminals of all states that infringe the liberty of the citizen A country whose malefactors should be all actually chained to the oar would be a country of the most perfect liberty  When a law is proposed in the assembly of the people they are not precisely demanded whether they severally approve or reject the proposition but whether it be conformable or not to the general will which is theirs as a collective body each person therefore in giving his vote declares his opinion on this head and on counting the votes the declaration of the general will is inferred from the majority When a law thus passes contrary to my opinion it proves nothing more than that I was mistaken and that I concluded the general will to be what it really was not So that if my particular advice had been followed it would have been contrary to my will  which as a citizen is the same as the general and in that case I should not have been free  This argument supposes indeed that all the characteristics of the general will are contained in the plurality of votes and when this ceases to be the case take what course you will there is an end of liberty  In having shewn how the will of particulars and parties is substituted for the general in public deliberations I have already sufficiently pointed out the practicable means of preventing such abuses of this however I shall speak further hereafter With regard to the proportional number of votes that indicate this general will I have also laid down the principles on which it may be determined The difference of a single voice is enough to break the unanimity but between unanimity and an equality there is a variety of proportions to each of which the number in question may be applied according to the circumstances of the body politic  There are two general maxims which may serve to regulate these proportions the one is that the more grave and important the deliberations  the nearer ought the determination to approach to unanimity the other is that the more expedition the affair requires the less should unanimity be insisted on In deliberations where the matter should be immediately determined the majority of a single vote should be sufficient The first of these maxims seems most applicable to permanent laws and the second to matters of business But be this as it may it is from their judicious combination that the best proportions must be deduced concerning that plurality in whose votes should be supposed to consist the general will  CHAP III Of Elections  WITH regard to the election of a prince or of magistrates which as I before observed is a complicated act there are two methods of proceeding viz by choice and by lot They have each been made use of in different republics and we see in our own times a very intricate mixture of both in the election of the doge of Venice  The preference by lot  says Montesquieu  is of the nature of a democracy  This I admit but not for the reasons given  The choice by lot  says he  is a method which offends nobody by permitting each citizen to entertain the reasonable hope of being preferred to the service of his country    This however is not the true reason If we reflect that the election of chiefs is a function of government and not of the sovereignty we shall see the reason why this method is of the nature of a democracy in which the administration is so much the better as its acts are fewer  In every real democracy the office of magistrate is not advantageous but expensive and burthensome so that it were unjust to impose it on one person rather than another The law therefore imposes that charge on him to whose lot it falls For in this case all standing an equal chance the choice doth not depend on human will nor can any particular application change the universality of the law  In an aristocracy the prince makes choice of the prince and the government providing for  itself here it is that votes are properly applicable The apparent exception in the election of the doge of Venice confirms this distinction instead of destroying it such a mixt form as is used by the Venetians is adapted to a mixt government For it is a mistake to suppose the government of Venice a true aristocracy If the lower order of people indeed have no share in the government the nobility stand in their place and become the people in respect to the administration What a number is there of the inferior order of nobles who stand no chance of ever getting into the magistracy and reap no other advantage from their rank than the empty title of Excellency and the privilege of sitting in the great Council This great council being as numerous as our general council at Geneva its illustrious members have no greater privileges therefore than our ordinary citizens It is certain that setting aside the extreme disparity of the two republics the burghers of Geneva represent exactly the Patricians of Venice our natives and sojourners represent the citizens and people and our peasants the inhabitants of the  terra firma  belonging to that state In a word consider their Venetian republic in what light you  will abstracted from its grandeur its government is no more aristocratical than that of Geneva All the difference is that we have no occasion for this kind of election  The choice by lot is attended with very little inconvenience in a real democracy when all men being nearly on an equality as well with regard to manners and abilities as to sentiments and fortune the matter of choice is indifferent But I have already observed a true democracy is only imaginary  When the election is of a mixt form viz by vote and by lot the first ought to provide for those officers which require proper talents as in military affairs the other being best adapted to those which require only common sense honesty and integrity such as the offices of judicature because in a wellformed state those qualities are possessed by all the citizens in common  No election either by vote or lot hath place under a monarchical government the monarch himself being the only rightful prince and legal magistrate the choice of his substitute is vested  in him alone When the Abbé de St Pierre therefore proposed to increase the number of the king's councils in France and to elect their members by ballot he was not aware that he proposed to change the form of the French government  It remains to speak of the manner of giving and collecting votes in popular assemblies but perhaps an historical sketch of the Roman police relating to this point will explain it better than all the maxims I should endeavour to establish It is worth the pains of a judicious reader to attend a little particularly to the manner in which they treated affairs both general and particular in a council of two hundred thousand persons  CHAP IV Of the Roman Comitia  WE have no authentic monuments of the earliest ages of Rome there is even great reason to believe that most of the stories told us of them are fabulous  The name of  Rome  which it is pretended was taken from  Romulus  is Greek and signifies  f  ce  the name of Numa is Greek also and signifies  law  What probability is there that the two first kings of this city should have been called by names so expressive of their future actions  and indeed the most interesting and instructive part of the annals of nations in general which is that of their establishment is the most imperfect Experience daily teaches us to what causes are owing the revolutions of kingdoms and empires but as we see no instances of the original formation of states we can only proceed on conjectures in treating this subject  The customs we find actually established however sufficiently attest there must have been an origin of those customs Those traditions  also relating to such origin which appear the most rational and of the best authority ought to pass for the most certain These are the maxims I have adopted in tracing the manner in which the most powerful and free people in the universe exercised the sovereign authority  After the foundation of Rome the rising republic that is to say the army of the founder composed of Albans Sabines and foreigners was divided into three classes which from that division took the name of tribes Each of these tribes was subdivided into ten  Curiae  and each  Curia  into  decuriae  at the head of which were placed chiefs respectively denominated  curiones  and  decuriones    Beside this there were selected from each tribe a body of an hundred cavaliers or knights called  centurions  by which it is evident that these divisions not being essential to the good order of a city were at first only military But it seems as if the presaging instinct of future greatness induced the little town of Rome to adopt at first a system of police proper for the metropolis of the world  From this primitive division however there speedily resulted an inconvenience This was that the tribe of Albans and that of the Sabines always remaining the same while that of the strangers was perpetually encreasing by the concourse of foreigners the latter soon surpassed the number of the two former The remedy which Servius applied to correct this dangerous abuse was to change the division and to substitute in the room of distinction of race which he abolished another taken from the parts of the town occupied by each tribe Instead of three tribes he constituted four each of which occupied one of the hills of Rome and bore its name Thus by removing this inequality for the present he prevented it also for the future and in order that such division should not only be local but personal he prohibited the inhabitants of one quarter of the city from removing to the other and thereby prevented the mixture of families  He doubled also the three ancient centuries of cavalry and made an addition of twelve others but always under their old denomination a simple and judicious method by which he compleatly distinguished the body of knights  from that of the people without exciting the murmurs of the latter  Again to these four city tribes Servius added fifteen others called rus  i  tribes because they were formed of the inhabitants of the country divided into as many cantons In the sequel were made an equal number of new divisions and the Roman people found themselves divided into thirtyfive tribes the number at which their divisions remained fixed till the final dissolution of the republic  From the distinction between the tribes of city and country resulted an effect worthy of observation because we have no other example of it and because Rome was at once indebted to it for the preservation of its manners and the increase of its empire It might be conceived the city tribes would soon arrogate to themselves the power and honours of the state and treat the rustics with contempt The effect nevertheless was directly contrary The taste of the ancient Romans for a country life is well known They derived this taste from the wise institutor who joined to liberty the labours of the peasant and the soldier and consigned as  it were to the city the cultivation of the arts trade intrigue fortune and slavery  Thus the most illustrious personages of Rome living in the country and employing themselves in the business of agriculture it was among these only the Romans looked for the defenders of their republic This station being that of the most worthy patricians was held in universal esteem the simple and laborious life of the villager was preferred to the mean and lazy life of the citizen and a person who having been a labourer in the country became a respectable housekeeper in town was yet held in contempt It is with reason says Varro that our magnanimous ancestors established in the country the nursery for those robust and brave men who defended them in time of war and cherished them in peace Again Pliny says in express terms the country tribes were honoured because of the persons of which they were composed whereas such of their individuals as were to be treated with ignominy were removed into the tribes of the city When the Sabine Appius Claudius came to settle in Rome he was loaded with honours and registered in one of the rustic tribes which afterwards took  the name of his family Lastly the freedmen were all entered in the city tribes never in the rural nor is there one single instance during the existence of the republic of any one of these freedmen being preferred to the magistracy although become a citizen  This was an excellent maxim but was carried so far that it effected an alteration and undoubtedly an abuse in the police of the state  In the first place the Censors after having long arrogated the right of arbitrarily removing the citizens from one tribe to another permitted the greater part to register themselves in whatever tribe they pleased a permission that could surely answer no good end and yet it deprived these officers of one of their severest methods of censure Besides as the great and powerful thus got themselves registered in the rural tribes and the freedmen with the populace only filled up those of the city the tribes in general had no longer a local distinction but were so strangely mixed and jumbled together that their respective members could be known only by appealing to the registers so that the idea attached to the word tribe  was changed from real to personal or rather became altogether chimerical  It happened also that the tribes of the city being nearer at hand had generally the greatest influence in the  Comitia  and made a property of the state by selling their votes to those who were base enough to purchase them  With regard to the  Curiae  ten having been instituted in each tribe the whole Roman people included within the walls made up thirty  Curiae  each of which had their peculiar temples their gods officers and feasts called  Compita  ia  resembling the  p  ganal  a  afterwards instituted among the rustic tribes  At the new division made by Servius the number thirty not being equally divisible among the four tribes he forbore to meddle with this mode of distribution and the Curiae thus independent of the tribes formed another division of the inhabitants No notice however was taken of the Curiae either among the rustic tribes or the people composing them because the tribes becoming a mere civil establishment and another method having been introduced for  raising the troops the military distinctions of Romulus were dropt as superfluous Thus though every citizen was registered in some tribe yet many of them were not included in any  curia  Servius made still a third division which had no relation to the two former and became in its consequences the most important of all He divided the whole Roman people into six classes which he distinguished neither by persons nor place but by property Of these the higher classes were filled by the rich the lower by the poor and the middle classes by those of middling fortunes These six classes were subdivided into one hundred ninetythree other bodies called centuries and these were again so distributed that the first class alone comprehended more than half the number of centuries and the last class only one single century In this method the class that contained the fewest persons had the greater number of centuries and the last class was in number only a subdivision although it contained more than half the inhabitants of Rome  In order that the people should penetrate less into the design of this latter form of distribution Servius affected to give it the air of a military  one In the second class he incorporated two centuries of armourers and annexed two instruments of war to the fourth In each class except the last he distinguished also between the young and the old that is to say those who were obliged to bear arms from those who were exempted from it on account of their age a distinction which gave more frequent rise to the repetition of the  census  or enumeration of them than even the shifting of property lastly he required their assembly to be made on the  Campus Martius  where all those who were of age for the service were to appear under arms  The reason why he did not pursue the same distinction of age in the last class was that the populace of which it was composed were not permitted to have the honour of bearing arms in the service of their country It was necessary to be housekeepers in order to attain the privilege of defending themselves There is not one private centinel perhaps of all those innumerable troops that make so brilliant a figure in the armies of modern princes who would not for want of property have been driven out with disdain from a Roman Cohort when soldiers were the defenders of liberty  In the last class however there was a distinction made between what they called  proletarii  and those denominated  capite censi  The former not quite reduced to nothing supplied the state at least with citizens and sometimes on pressing occasions with soldiers As to those who were totally destitute of substance and could be numbered only by capitation they were disregarded as nothing Marius being the first who deigned to enroll them  Without taking upon me here to decide whether this third species of division be in itself good or ill I may venture safely to affirm that nothing less than that simplicity of manners which prevailed among the ancient Romans their disinterestedness their taste for agriculture their contempt for trade and the thirst of gain could have rendered it practicable Where is the nation among the moderns in which voracious avarice a turbulence of disposition a spirit of artifice and the continual fluctuation of property would permit such an establishment to continue for twenty years without overturning the state Nay it must be well observed that the purity of the Roman manners and the force of a censure more efficacious than the institution  itself served to correct the defects of it at Rome where a rich man was often removed from his own class and ranked among the poor for making an improper parade of his wealth  It is easy to comprehend from this why mention is hardly ever made of more than five classes though there were in reality six The sixth furnishing neither the army with soldiers nor the  Campus Martius  I say the  Campus Martius  because it was there the  Comitia  assembled by centuries in the two other forms they assembled in the  forum  and other places where the  capite censi  had as much influence and importance as the principal citizens  with voters and being of hardly any use in the republic was hardly ever accounted any thing  Such were the different divisions of the Roman people We will now examine into the defects of which they were productive in their assemblies These assemblies when legally convoked were denominated  om  a  and were held in the  Campus Martius  and other parts of Rome being distinguished into  cu  ata centuriata  and  tributa  according to the three grand divisions  of the people into  Curiae Centuries  and  Tribes  The  Comitia curiata  were instituted by Romulus the  Centuriata  by Servius and the  Tributa  by the tribunes of the people Nothing could pass into a law nor could any magistrate be chosen but in the  Comitia  and as there was no citizen who was not enrolled in a  Curia Century  or  Tribe  it follows that no citizen was excluded from giving his vote so that the Roman people were truly sovereign both in right and fact  To make the assembly of the  Comitia  legal and give their determinations the force of laws three conditions were requisite In the first place it was necessary that the magistrate or body convoking them should be invested with proper authority for so doing Secondly that the assembly should occur on the days permitted by law and thirdly that the augurs should be favourable to their meeting  The reason of the first condition needs no explanation The second is an affair of police thus it was not permitted the  Comitia  to assemble on market days when the country people coming to Rome on business would be prevented from transacting it By the third the Senate kept a fierce and turbulent multitude  under some restraint and opportunely checked the ardour of the seditious tribunes the latter however found more ways than one to elude the force of this expedient  But the laws and the election of the chiefs were not the only matters submitted to the determination of the  Comitia  the Roman people having usurped the most important functions of government the fate of Europe might be said to depend on their assemblies Hence the variety of objects that came before them gave occasion for divers alterations in the form of these assemblies according to the nature of those objects  To judge of these diversities it is sufficient to compare them together The design of Romulus in instituting the  Curiae  was to restrain the Senate by means of the people and the people by the Senate while he himself maintained his influence equally over both By this form therefore he gave to the people all the authority of number to counterballance that of power and riches which he left in the hands of the Patricians But agreeable to the spirit of monarchy he gave more advantage to the Patricians by the influence of their clients to obtain  the majority of votes This admirable institution of patrons and clients was a masterpiece of politics and humanity without which the order of Patricians so contrary to the spirit of the republic could not have subsisted Rome alone hath the honour of giving to the world this fine example of which no abuse is known to have been made and which nevertheless hath never been adopted by other nations  This division by  Curiae  having subsisted under the kings till the time of Servius and the reign of the last  Tarquin  being accounted illegal the regal laws came hence to be generally distinguished by the name of  leges curiatae    Under the republic the  Curiae  always confined to the four city tribes and comprehending only the populace of Rome could not arrive either at the honour of sitting in the Senate which was at the head of the Patricians or at that of being Tribunes which notwithstanding they were Plebeians were yet at the head of the citizens in easy circumstances They fell therefore into discredit and were reduced to so contemptible a state that their thirty Lictors assembled to do the whole business of the  Comitia curiata    The division by  centuries  was so favourable to aristocracy that it is not at first easy to comprehend why the Senate did not always carry their point in the  Comitia centuriata  by which the Consuls▪ Censors and Praetors were chosen It is in fact certain that out of the hundred and ninety three centuries forming the six classes of the whole Roman people the first class containing ninety eight of them and the votes being reckoned only centuries this first class alone had more votes than all the others When the centuries of this class therefore were found to be unanimous they proceeded no farther in counting votes whatever might be determined by the minority being considered as the opinion of the mob So that it might be justly said that in the  Comitia centuriata  matters were carried rather by the greater quantity of money than the majority of votes  But this extreme authority was moderated by two causes In the first place the Tribunes generally speaking and always a considerable number of wealthy citizens being in this class of the rich they counterpoized the credit of the Patricians in the same class The second cause lay in the manner of voting which was this the centuries instead of voting according  to order beginning with the first in rank cast lots which should proceed first to the election And to this the century whose lot it was proceeded  The century thus preferred by lot was called  prae+rogati  a  because it was the first whose suffrage was demanded and hence is derived the word  prerogative    alone the other centuries being called upon another day to give their votes according to their rank when they repeated the same election and usually confirmed the choice of the former By this method the preference of rank was set aside in order to give it according to lot agreeable to the principles of democracy  There is another advantage resulting from this custom which is that the citizens residing in the country had time between the two elections to inform themselves of the merit of the candidates thus provisionally nominated by which means they might be better enabled to give their vote But under the pretence of expediting affairs this custom was in time abolished and the two elections were made the same day  The  Comitia by Tribes  were properly speaking the great council of the Roman people These were convoked only by the Tribunes by these also the Tribunes were chosen and by these the  plebiscita  or laws of the people were passed The Senators were not only destitute of rank in these assemblies they had not even the right to be present at them but obliged to pay obedience to laws in the enacting of which they had no vote they were in that respect less free than the lowest citizens This injustice however was very ill understood and was in itself alone sufficient to invalidate the decrees of a body whose members were not all admitted to vote Had all the Patricians assisted at these  Comitia  as they had a right in quality of citizens they could have had no undue influence where every man's vote was equal even from the lowest of the people to the highest personage of the state  It is evident therefore that exclusive of the good order that resulted from these several divisions in collecting the votes of so numerous a people the form and method of these divisions were not indifferent in themselves each being productive of effects adapted to  certain views in regard to which it was preferable to any other  But without entering into a more circumstantial account of these matters it is plain from what hath been advanced that the  Comitia tribunata  were the most favourable to a popular government and the  Comitia centuriata  to an aristocracy With respect to the  Comitia curia a  of which the populace formed the majority as they were good for nothing but to favour tyrannical designs they remained in this contemptible state into which they were fallen even the contrivers of sedition themselves not chusing to employ means which must have exposed too openly their designs It is very certain that all the majesty of the Roman people was displayed only in the  Comitia centuriata  which only were compleat the  curiata  wanting the rustic Tribes and the  tribunata  the Senate and Patricians  With regard to the method of collecting the votes it was among the primitive Romans simple as their manners though stillless simple than that of Sparta Every one gave his vote aloud which the register took down in writing the plurality of votes in each tribe determined the vote of that tribe and the plurality of votes in the  tribes determined the suffrage of the people In the same manner also they proceeded with re+gard to the  Curiae  and the centuries This custom was a very good one so long as integrity prevailed among the citizens and every one was ashamed to give his public sanction to an unworthy person or cause But when the people grew corrupt and sold their votes it became necessary to make them give their votes more privately in order to restrain the purchasers by distrust and afford knaves an expedient to avoid being traitors  I know that Cicero censures this alteration and attributes to it in a great degree the ruin of the republic But though I am sensible of all the weight of Cicero's authority in this case I cannot be of his opinion I conceive on the contrary that the ruin of the state would have been accelerated had the Romans neglected making this alteration As the regimen of people in health is not proper for the sick so it is absurd to think of governing a corrupt people by the same laws as were expedient for them before they were corrupted There cannot be a stronger proof of this maxim than the duration of the republic of Venice the shadow of which still exists solely because its laws are adapted only to bad men  On this change in the manner of voting tablets were distributed among the citizens by means of which they could give their suffrage without its being known On this occasion other methods were of course made use of in collecting votes such as counting the number of voices comparing it with that of the tablets c Not that these methods were so effectual as to prevent the returning officers  Custodes ditibitores rogatores suffragiorum  from being often suspected of partiality and it is plain in the sequel by the multiplicity of laws made to prevent bribery and corruption in elections that they could not effect this point  Toward the decline of the republic recourse was had to very extraordinary expedients to make up for the insufficiency of the laws Prodigies were sometimes played off with success but this scheme though it imposed on the multitude did not impose on those who influenced them Sometimes assemblies were called suddenly and in great haste that the candidates might not have time to create an undue interest at others again the whole sessions was spent in declamation when it was seen that the people  were biassed to take a wrong side At length however ambition eluded all these precautions and it is almost incredible that in the midst of so many abuses this immense people still continued by virtue of their ancient laws to elect their magistrates to pass laws to judge causes and to expedite both public and private affairs with as much facility as could have been done in the Senate itself  CHAP V On a Tribunate  WHEN it is impracticable to establish an exact proportion between the component parts of a state or that inevitable causes perpetually operate to change their relations a particular magistracy is instituted which not incorporating with the rest replaces every term in its true relation and constitutes in itself a due medium either between the prince and the people between the prince and the sovereign or in cases of necessity at once between both  This body which I shall call a  Tribunate  is the preserver of the laws and of the legislative  power It serves sometimes to protect the sovereign against the government as the tribunes of the people did at Rome sometimes to protect the government against the people as at present the council of the  ten  do at Venice and again at others to maintain an equilibrium both on the one part and the other as did the Ephori at Sparta  The Tribunate is not a constitutional part of the city and ought not therefore to have any share in the legislative or executive power even in this however its own is much greater for being able to do nothing itself it may prevent any thing from being done by others It is more sacred and revered as defender of the laws than the prince who executes them or the sovereign who enacts them This was very evident at Rome when the haughty Patricians who always despised the people collectively were nevertheless obliged to give place to their common officers without command or jurisdiction  The Tribunate when judiciously moderated is the firmest support of a good constitution but if it have ever so little ascendency of power  it subverts every thing With regard to its weakness it is not natural to it for provided it have any existence at all it can never have too little power  It degenerates into tyranny when it usurps the executive power of which it is only the moderator and when it would interpret the laws which it should only protect The enormous power of the Ephori which was exercised without danger while Sparta retained its purity of manners served only to increase the corruption of them when once begun The blood of Agis spilt by those tyrants was revenged by his successor the crime and the punishment of the Ephori accelerated equally the ruin of that republic for after the time of Cleomenes Sparta was nothing The destruction of the Roman republic was effected in the same manner the excessive power which the Tribunes by degrees usurped served at length with the help of the laws made in defence of liberty as a security to the Emperors who destroyed it As for the council of  ten  at Venice it is a most sanguinary tribunal equally horrible to the Patricians and the people and which is so far from openly protecting the laws that it now serves but secretly to effect the breach of them  The Tribunate is enfeebled as well as the government by increasing the number of its members When the Roman Tribunes at first two and afterwards five had a mind to double their number the Senate did not oppose it being well assured they should be able to make one a curb to another which was actually the case  The best way to prevent the usurpations of so formidable a body a way that no government hath hitherto adopted would be to render such a body not permanent but to regulate the intervals during which it should remain dissolved These intervals which should not be so great as to give abuses time to strengthen into customs might be fixed by law in such a manner that it would be easy to abridge them in case of necessity by extraordinary commission  This method appears to me to be attended with no inconvenience because as I have already observed the Tribunate making no essential part of the constitution may be suppressed without injury and it appears to me effectual because a magistrate newly reestablished doth not succeed to the power of his predecessor but to that which the law confers on him  CHAP VI Of the Dictature  THAT inflexibility of the laws which prevents their yielding to circumstances may in some cases render them hurtful and in some critical juncture bring on the ruin of the state The order and prolixity of forms take up a length of time of which the occasion will not always admit A thousand accidents may happen for which the legislature hath not provided and it is a very necessary foresight to see that it is impossible to provide for every thing  We should not be desirous therefore of establishing the laws so firmly as to suspend their effects Even Sparta itself sometimes permitted the laws to lie dormant  Nothing however but the certainty of greater danger should induce a people to make any alteration in government nor should the sacred power of the laws be ever restrained unless the public safety is concerned In such uncommon cases when the danger is manifest the public safety may be provided for by a particular act which commits the charge of it to those who  are most worthy Such a commission may pass in two different ways according to the nature of the danger  If the case require only a greater activity in the government it should be confined to one or two members in which case it would not be the authority of the laws but the form of the administration only that would be changed But if the danger be of such a nature that the formality of the laws would prevent a remedy then a supreme chief might be nominated who should silence the laws and suspend for a moment the sovereign authority In such a case the general Will cannot be doubted it being evident that the principal intention of the people must be to save the state from perdition By this mode of temporary suspension the legislative authority is not abolished the magistrate who silences it cannot make it speak and though he overrules cannot represent it he may do every thing indeed but make laws  The first method was taken by the Roman Senate when it charged the consuls in a sacred manner to provide for the safety of the  commonwealth The second took place when one of the consuls nominated a dictator  This nomination was secretly made in the night as if they were ashamed of the action of placing any man so much above the laws  a custom which Rome adopted from the example of Alba  In the early times of the republic the Romans had frequent recourse to the dictatorship because the state had not then sufficient stability to support itself by the force of its constitution The manners of the people also rendering those precautions unnecessary which were taken in aftertimes there was no fear that a dictator would abuse his authority or that he would be tempted to keep it in his hands beyond the term On the contrary it appeared that so great a power was burthensome to the person invested with it so eager were they to resign it as if it were a difficult and dangerous post to be superior to the laws  Thus it was not the danger of the abuse but of the debasement of this supreme magistracy  that gave occasion to censure the indiscreet use of it in ancient times For when they came to prostitute it in the affair of elections and other matters of mere formality it was very justly to be apprehended that it would become less respectable on pressing occasions and that the people would be apt to look upon an office as merely titular which was instituted to assist at empty ceremonies  Toward the end of the republic the Romans becoming more circumspect were as sparing of the dictature as they had before been prodigal of it It was easy to see however that their fears were groundless that the weakness of the capital was their security against the internal magistrates that a dictator might in some cases have acted in defence of public liberty without ever making encroachments on it and that the Roman chains were not forged in Rome itself but in its armies abroad The weak resistance which Marius made to Sylla and Pompey to Caesar shewed plainly how little the authority from within the city could do against the power from without  This error led them to commit great blunders Such for instance was their neglecting to appoint a dictator in the affair of Cataline For as it engaged only the city or at most a province in Italy a dictator invested with that unlimited authority which the laws conferred on him might easily have dissipated that conspiracy which was with difficulty suppressed by a numerous concurrence of fortunate circumstances which human prudence had no reason to expect Instead of that the Senate contented itself with committing all its power into the hands of consuls whence it happened that Cicero in order to act effectually was obliged to exceed that power in a capital circumstance and though the public in their first transports approved of his conduct he was very justly called to an account afterwards for the blood he had spilt contrary to the laws a reproach they could not not have made to a dictator But the eloquence of the consul carried all before it and preferring though a Roman his own glory to his country he thought less of the most legal and certain method of saving the state than the means of securing all the honour  of such a transaction to himself  This is what he could not be certain of in proposing a dictator not daring to nominate himself and not being assured his colleague would do it  Thus was he very justly honoured as the deliverer of Rome and as justly punished as the violator of its laws For however honourable was his repeal it was certainly a matter of favour  After all in whatever manner this important commission may be conferred it is of consequence to limit its duration to a short term which should on no occasion be prolonged In those conjunctures when it is necessary to appoint a dictator the state is presently saved or destroyed which causes being over the dictature becomes useless and tyrannical At Rome the dictators held their office only for six months and the greater part resigned before that term expired Had the time appointed been longer it is to be apprehended they would have been tempted to make it longer still as did the  decemvir  whose office lasted a whole year The dictator had no more time allotted him than was necessary to dispatch the business for which he was appointed so that he had not leisure to think of other projects  CHAP VII Of the Censorship  AS the declaration of the general will is made by the laws so the declaration of the public judgment is made by their censure The public opinion is a kind of law which the Censor puts in execution in particular cases after the example of the prince  So far therefore is the censorial tribunal from being the arbiter of popular opinions it only declares them and whenever it departs from them its decisions are vain and ineffectual  It is useless to distinguish the manners of a nation by the objects of its esteem for these depend on the same principle and are necessarily confounded together Among all people in the world it is not nature but opinion which determines the choice of their pleasures Correct the prejudices and opinions of men and their manners will correct themselves We always admire what is beautiful or what appears  so but it is in our judgment we are mistaken it is this judgment then we are to regulate Whoever judges of manners takes upon him to judge of honour and whoever judges of honour decides from opinion  The opinions of a people depend on the constitution though the laws do not govern manners it is the legislature that gives rise to them As the legislature grows feeble manners degenerate but the judgment of the censors will not then effect what the power of the laws have not before effected  It follows hence that the office of a censor may be useful to the preservation of manners but never to their reestablishment Establish censors during the vigour of the laws when this is past all is over no legal means can be effectual when the laws have lost their force  The censor is preservative of manners by preventing the corruption of opinions by maintaining their morality and propriety by judicious applications and even sometimes by settling them when in a fluctuating situation The use  of seconds in duels though carried to the greatest excess in France was abolished by the following words inserted in one of the kings edicts  As to those who have the cowardice to call themselves seconds  This judgment anticipating that of the public was effectual and put an end to that custom at once But when the same edicts pronounced it cowardice to fight a duel though it is certainly true yet as it was contrary to the popular opinion the public laughed at a determination so contrary to their own  I have observed elsewhere  I do but slightly mention here what I have treated more at large in my letter to M d'Alembert  that the public opinion being subjected to no constraint there should be no appearance of it in the tribunal established to represent it One cannot too much admire with what art this spring of action entirely neglected among the moderns was employed by the Romans and still more effectually by the Lacedemonians  A man of bad morals having made an excellent proposal in the council at Sparta the  Ephori without taking any notice of it caused the same proposal to be made by a citizen of character and virtue How honourable was this proceeding to the one and how disgraceful to the other and that without directly praising or blaming either Some drunkards of Samos having behaved indecently in the tribunal of the Ephori it was the next day permitted by a public edict that the Samians might become slaves Would an actual punishment have been so severe as such impunity When the Spartans had once passed their judgment on the decency or propriety of any behaviour all Greece submitted to their opinion  CHAP VIII Of political Religion  IN the first ages of the world men had no other kings than gods nor any other government than what was purely theocratical It required a great alteration in their sentiments and ideas before they could prevail on themselves to look upon a fellow creature as a master and think it went well with them  Hence a deity being constantly placed at the head of every political society it followed that there was as many different gods as people Two communities personally strangers to each other and almost always at variance could not long acknowlege the same master nor could two armies drawn up against each other in battle obey the same chief Thus Polytheism became a natural consequence of the division of nations and thence the want of civil and theological toleration which are perfectly the same as will be shewn hereafter  The notion of the Greeks in pretending to trace their own gods among those of the Barbarian nations took its rise evidently from the ambition of being thought the natural sovereigns of those people In this age however we think that a most absurd part of erudition which relates to the identity of the deities of different nations and according to which it is supposed that Moloch Saturn and Chronos were one and the same god and that the Baal of the Phenicians the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jupiter of the Latins were the same deity as if any thing could be found in common  between chimerical beings bearing different names  If it be asked why there were no religious wars among the Pagans when every state had thus its peculiar deity and worship I answer it was plainly for this very reason that each state having its own peculiar religion as well as government no distinction was made between the obedience paid to their gods and that due to their laws Thus their political were at the same time theological wars and the departments of their deities were prescribed by the limits of their respective nations The god of one people had no authority over another people nor were these Pagan deities jealous of their prerogatives but divided the adoration of mankind amicably between them Even Moses himself sometimes speaks in the same manner of the god of Israel It is true the Hebrews despised the gods of the Canaanites a people proscribed and devoted to destruction whose possessions were given them for an inheritance but they speak with more reverence of the deities of the neighbouring nations whom they were forbidden to attack  Wi  t thou not possess that  says Jeptha to Sihon king of the Ammonites  which Chemoth thy God giveth thee to possess So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us them will we possess  There is in this passage I think an acknowleged similitude between the rights of Chemosh and those of the God of Israel  But when the Jews being subjected to the kings of Babylon and afterwards to those of Syria persisted in refusing to acknowlege any god but their own this refusal was esteemed an act of rebellion against their conquerer and drew upon them those persecutions we read of in their history and of which no other example is extant previous to the establishment of christianity  It is evident that the war of the Phocians called an holy war was not a religious war Its object was to punish sacrilege and not to subdue infidels    The religion of every people being thus exclusively annexed to the laws of the state the only method of converting nations was to subdue them warriors were the only missionaries and the obligation of changing their religion being a law to the vanquished they were first to be conquered before they were solicited on  this head So far were men from fighting for the gods that their gods like those of Homer fought in behalf of mankind Each people demanded the victory from its respective deity and expressed their gratitude for it by the erection of new altars The Romans before they besieged any fortress summoned its gods to abandon it and though it be true they  the people of Tarentum in possession of  angry deities it is plain they looked upon th  se gods as subjected and obliged to do homage to their own They left the vanquished in possession of their religion as they sometimes did in that of their laws a wreathe for Jupiter of the Capitol being often the only tribute they exacted  At length the Romans having extended their religion with their empire and sometimes even adopted the deities of the vanquished the people of this vast empire found themselves in possession of a multiplicity of gods and religions which not differing essentially from each other Paganism became insensibly one and the same religion throughout the world  Things were in this state when Jesus came to establish his spiritual kingdom on earth a design  which necessarily dividing the theological from the political system gave rise to those intestine divisions which have ever since continued to embroil the profession of Christianity Now this new idea of a kingdom in the other world having never entered into the head of the Pagans they regarded the Christians as actual rebels who under an hypocritical shew of humility waited only a proper opportunity to render themselves independent and artfully to usurp that authority which in their weak and infant state they pretended to respect and this was undoubtedly the cause of their being persecuted  What the Pagans were apprehensive of also did in process of time actually come to pass Things put on a new face and the meek Christians as their number increased changed their tone while their invisible kingdom of the other world became under a visible head the most despotic and tyrannical in this  As in all countries however there were civil governors and laws there resulted from this two fold power a perpetual struggle for jurisdiction which renders a perfect system of  domestic policy almost impossible in Christian states and prevents us from ever coming to a determination whether it be the prince or the priest we are bound to obey  Some nations indeed even in Europe or its neighbourhood have endeavoured to preserve or reestablish the ancient system but without success the spirit of Christianity hath universally prevailed Religious worship hath always remained or again become independent of the sovereign and without any necessary connection with the body of the state Mahomet had very salutary and wellconnected views in his political system and so long as his modes of government subsisted under the caliphs and their successors that government remained perfectly uniform and so far good But the Arabians becoming wealthy learned polite indolent and cowardly were subdued by the Barbarians then the division between the two powers recommenced and though it be less apparent among the Mahometans than among Christians it is nevertheless to be distinguished particularly in the sect of Ali there are some states also as in Persia where this division is constantly perceptible  Among us the kings of England are placed at the head of the church as are also the Czars in Russia but by this title they are not so properly masters as ministers of the religion of these countries they are not possessed of the power to change it but only to maintain its present form Wherever the Clergy constitute a collective body  It must be observed that it is not so much the formal assemblies of the clergy such as are held in France which unite them together in a body as the communion of their churches Communion and excommunication form the social compact of the clergy a compact by means of which they will always maintain their ascendency over both kings and people All the priests that communicate together are fellowcitizens though they should be personally as distant as the extremities of the world This invention is a masterpiece in policy The Pagan priests had nothing like it and therefore never had any clerical body  they will be both masters and legislators in their own cause There are therefore two sovereigns in England and Russia as well as elsewhere  Of all Christian authors Mr Hobbes was the only one who saw the evil and the remedy and that hath ventured to propose the reunion  of the two heads of this eagle and to restore that political union without which no state or government can be well constituted But he ought to have seen that the prevailing spirit of Christianity was incompatible with his system and that the interest of the Church would be always too powerful for the state It was not so much that which was really false and shocking in the writings of this philosopher as what was really just and true that rendered him odious  In a letter of Grotius to his brother dated the th of April ▪ may be seen what that great Civilian approved and blamed in his book  de cive  It is true that Grotius being indulgent seems inclined to forgive the author the faults of his book for the sake of its merits the rest of the world however were not so candid    I conceive that by a proper display of historical facts in this point of view it would be easy to refute the opposite sentiments both of Bayle and Warburton the former of which pretends that no religion whatever can be of service to the body politic and the latter that Christianity is its best and firmest support It might be proved against the first that every  state in the world hath been founded on the basis of religion and against the second that the precepts of Christianity are at the bottom more prejudicial than conducive to the strength of the state  In order to make myself fully understood I need only give a little more precision to the vague ideas generally entertained of political religion  Religion considered as it relates to society which is either general or particular may be distinguished into two kinds viz the religion of the man and that of the citizen The first destitute of temples altars or rites confined purely to the internal worship of the supreme Being and to the performance of the eternal duties of morality is the pure and simple religion of the gospel this is genuine theism and may be called the law of natural divinity The other adopted only in one country whose gods and tutelary saints are hence peculiar to itself is composed of certain dogmas rites and external modes of worship prescribed by the laws of such country all foreigners being accounted Infidels Aliens and Barbarians this  kind of religion extends the duties and privileges of men no farther than to its own altars Such were all the religions of primitive ages to which may be given the name of the law of civil or positive divinity  There is a third kind of religion still more extraordinary which dividing society into two legislatures two chiefs and two parties subjects mankind to contradictory obligations and prevents them from being at once devotees and citizens Such is the religion of the Lamas of the Japanese and of the Roman Catholics which may be denominated the religion of the priests and is productive of a sort of mixed and unsociable obligation for which we have no name  If we examine these three kinds of religion in a political light they have all their faults The third is so palpably defective that it would be mere loss of time to point them out Whatever contributes to dissolve the social union is good for nothing all institutions which set man in contradiction with himself are of no use  The second is so far commendable as it unites divine worship with a respect for the laws and that making the country the object of the people's adoration the citizen is taught that to serve the state is to serve its tutelary divinity This is a species of theocracy in which there should be no other pontiff than the prince no other priests than the magistrates To die in such a state for their country is to suffer martyrdom to violate the laws is impiety and to doom a criminal to public execration is to devote him to the anger of the gods  It is blameable however in that being founded on falsehood and deceit it leads mankind into error rendering them credulous and superstitious it substitutes vain ceremonies instead of the true worship of the deity It is further blameable in that becoming exclusive and tyrannical it makes people sanguinary and persecuting so that a nation shall sometimes breathe nothing but murder and massacre and think at the same time they are doing an holy action in cutting the throats of those who worship the gods in a different manner from themselves This circumstance places such a people  in a natural state of war with all others which is very unfavourable to their own safety  There remains then only the rational and manly religion of Christianity not however as it is professed in modern times but as it is displayed in the gospel which is quite another thing According to this holy sublime and true religion mankind being all the children of the same God acknowlege themselves to be brothers and the society which unites them dissolves only in death  But this religion having no particular relation to the body politic leaves the laws in possession only of their own force without adding any thing to it by which means the firmest bonds of such particular society are of no effect Add to this that Christianity is so far from attaching the hearts of the citizens to the state that it detaches them from it as well as from all worldly objects in general than which nothing can be more contrary to the spirit of society  It is said that a nation of true Christians would form the most perfect society imaginable  To this assertion however there is one great objection and this is that a society of true Christians would not be a society of men Nay I will go so far as to affirm that this supposed society with all its perfection would neither be of the greatest strength nor duration In consequence of its being perfect it would want the strongest ties of connexion and thus this very circumstance would destroy it  Individuals might do their duty the people might be obedient to the laws the chiefs might be just the magistrate incorrupt the soldiery might look upon death with contempt and there might prevail neither vanity nor luxury in such a state So far all would go well but let us look farther  Christianity is a spiritual religion relative only to celestial objects the Christian's inheritance is not of this world He performs his duty it is true but this he does with a profound indifference for the good or ill success of his endeavours Provided he hath nothing to reproach himself with it is of little importance to him whether matters go well or ill here below  If the state be in a flourishing situation he can hardly venture to rejoice in the public felicity lest he should be puffed up with the inordinate pride of his country's glory if the state decline he blesses the hand of God that humbles his people to the dust  It is farther necessary to the peace and harmony of society that all the citizens should be without exception equally good Christians for if unhappily there should be one of them ambitious or hypocritical if there should be found among them a Cataline or a Cromwell it is certain he would make an easy prey of his pious countrymen Christian charity doth not easily permit the thinking evil of one's neighbour No sooner should an individual discover the art of imposing on the majority and be invested with some portion of public authority than he would become a dignitary Christians must not speak evil of dignities thus respected he would thence assume power Christians must obey the superior powers Does the depositary of power abuse it he becomes the rod by which it pleases God to chastise his children  And would their consciences permit them to drive out the usurper the public tranquillity must be broken and violence and bloodshed succeed all this agrees but ill with the meekness of true Christians and after all what is it to them whether they are freemen or slaves in this vale of misery Their essential concern is to work out their salvation and obtain happiness in another world to effect which their resignation in this is held to be their duty  Should such a state be forced into a war with any neighbouring power The citizens might march readily to the combat without thinking of flight they might do their duty in the field but they would have no ardour for victory being better instructed to die than to conquer Of what consequence is it to them whether they are victors or vanquished Think what advantages an impetuous and sanguine enemy might take of their stoicism draw them out against a brave and generous people ardently inspired with the love of glory and their country suppose for instance your truly Christian republic against that of Sparta or of Rome what would be the consequence Your  devout Christians would be beaten discomfited and knocked on the head before they had time to look about them their only security depending on the contempt which their enemy might entertain for them It was in my opinion a fine oath that was taken by the soldiers of Fabius They did not make a vow either to die or conquer they swore they would return conquerors and punctually performed their oath Christian troops could not have made such a vow they would have been afraid of tempting the Lord their God  But I am all this while committing a blunder in speaking of a Christian republic one of these terms necessarily excluding the other Christianity inculcates servitude and dependence the spirit of it is too favourable to tyrants for them not sometimes to profit by it True Christians are formed for slaves they know it and never trouble themselves about conspiracies and insurrections this transitory life is of too little value in their esteem  Will it be said the Christians are excellent soldiers I deny it Produce me your Christian  troops For my part I know of no true Christian soldiers Do you name those of the Crusades I answer that not to call in question the valour of the Crusaders they were very far from being Christian citizens they were the soldiers of the priest the citizens of the church they fought for its spiritual country which some how or other it had converted into a temporal one To set this matter in the best light it was a kind of return to Paganism for as the gospel did not establish any national religion an holy war could not possibly be carried on by true Christians  Under the Pagan emperors the Christian soldiers were brave of this all the Christian writers assure us and I believe them the motive of their bravery was a spirit of honour or emulation excited by the Pagan troops But when the emperors became Christians this motive of emulation no longer subsisted and when the Cross had put the Eagle to flight the Roman valour disappeared▪  But laying aside political considerations let us return to the matter of right and ascertain  its true principles with regard to this important point The right which the social compact confers on the sovereign extending no farther than to public utility  In a republic  says the Marquis d'A  every one is perfectly at liberty because no one may injure another  This is the invariable limit of republican liberty nor is it possible to state the case more precisely I cannot deny myself the pleasure of sometimes quoting this manuscript though unknown to the public in order to do honour to the memory of an illustrious and respectable personage who preserved the integrity of the citizen even in the ministry and adopted the most unpright and salutary views in the government of his country  the subject is not accountable to that sovereign on account of any opinions he may entertain that have nothing to do with the community Now it is of great importance to a state that every citizen should be of a religion that may inspire him with a regard for his duty but the tenets of that religion are no farther interesting to the community than as they relate to morals and to the discharge of those obligations which the professor lies under to his fellow citizens If we  except these the individual may profess what others he pleases without the sovereign's having any right to interfere for having no jurisdiction in the other world it is nothing to the sovereign what becomes of the citizens in a future life provided they discharge the duties incumbent on them in the present  There is a profession of Faith therefore purely political the articles of which it is in the province of the sovereign to ascertain not precisely as articles of religion but as the sentiments due to society without which it is impossible to be a good citizen or faithful subject  Caesar in pleading for Cataline▪ endeavoured to establish the doctrine of the Mortality of the Soul Cato and Cicero in answer to him did not enter into a philosophical discussion of the argument but contented themselves with shewing that Caesar had spoken like a bad citizen and advanced a dogma pernicious to the state And this was in fact the point only that come before the Senate of Rome and not a question in theology  Without compelling any one to adopt these sentiments the sovereign may also equitably banish him the society not indeed as impious but as unsociable as incapable of having a sincere regard  to justice and of sacrificing his life if required to his duty Again should any one after having made a public profession of such sentiments betray his disbelief of them by his misconduct he may equitably be punished with death having committed the greatest of all crimes that of belying his heart in the face of the laws  The tenets of political religion should be few and simple they should be laid down also wit precision and without explication or comment The existence of a powerful intelligent beneficent prescient and provident Deity a future state the reward of the virtuous and the punishment of the wicked the sacred nature of the social contract and of the laws these should be its positive tenets As to those of a negative kind I would confine myself solely to one by forbidding persecution  Those who affect to make a distinction between civil and religious toleration are in my opinion mistaken It is impossible to live cordially in peace with those whom we firmly believe devoted to damnation to love them would be to hate the Deity for punishing them it is therefore absolutely necessary for us either to  persecute or to convert them Wherever the spirit of religious persecution subsists it is impossible it should not have some effect on the civil police in which case the sovereign is no longer sovereign even in a secular view the priests become the real masters and kings only their officers  In modern governments where it is impossible to support an exclusive national religion it is requisite to tolerate all such as breathe the spirit of toleration toward others provided their tenets are not contradictory to the duty of a good citizen But whosoever should presume to say  There is no salvation out of the pale of our church  ought to be banished the state unless indeed the state be an ecclesiastical one and the prince a pontiff Such a dogma is of use only in a theocratical government in every other it is destructive The reason which it is said Henry IV gave for embracing the Roman Catholic religion ought to have made an honest man reject it and more particularly a prince capable of reasoning on the subject  CHAP IX The Conclusion  HAVING thus stated the true principles of politic law and endeavoured to fix the state on its proper basis it remains to shew in what manner it is supported by external relations  Under this head would be comprehended the laws of nations and commerce the laws of war and conquest leagues negotiations treaties c But these present a new prospect too vast and extensive for so short a sight as mine which should be confined to objects less distant and more adapted to my limited capacity  FINIS  In the Press and
