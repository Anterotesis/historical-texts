 DUPLICITY A COMEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  By THOMAS HOLCROFT  LONDON Printed for G ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW  M DCC LXXXI  TO THOMAS HARRIS ESQ THIS COMEDY IS INSCRIBED AS A PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE ADVANTAGES IT RECEIVED FROM HIS GREAT ATTENTION AND TASTE AS A CRITIC  BY HIS MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT THOMAS HOLCROFT  PREFACE  SINCE it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more severe scrutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind authors in this predicament are justifiable in taking every opportunity of speaking in their own behalf and the egotism should be and is by the candid readily forgiven them The applauses bestowed upon DUPLICITY in the Theatre have equalled my fondest hopes and selflove itself cannot accuse the auditors of ingratitude or want of penetration But though there are scenes happy enough to have given universal satisfaction there are others that have been called vulgarities damned stuff and by other concise and summary epithets which men accustomed to decide without deigning to reason have invented and appropriated to their own proper use I do not mean to affirm there is no truth in these remarks I am perhaps the person least qualified of any to pronounce with safety on the merits or demerits of the work Fathers who are the most free from prejudice cannot see  those defects in their offspring which are obvious to others In the rapidity of composition blemishes are suffered to escape through a laudable attention to things of greater importance and like an ugly face presently become too familiar to be disgusting It is for this reason dangerous to commit any thing to paper which the judgment at the first perception condemns A work of any consequence is read and reconsidered so repeatedly that the ideas at last lose both novelty and force and the writer is disgusted to find those things which when first conceived gave him so much pleasure become vapid and assume the appearance of common place For these reasons I say it would be arrogant in me to speak decidedly I can only alledge what were my original motives for writing as I have done  The English Comic Drama has long been renowned for humour and when about fourteen years ago the French  Com√©die Larmoyante  or as we call it Sentimental Comedy was introduced the complaint was that we had lost all the spirit of our old writers and were dwindled into mere translators The town was in this temper when Dr Goldsinith's Comedy of SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER was produced in which humour alone seems to be the chief intention of the Author and which gave a fatal blow to mere sentimental dialogue The success of this  piece rouzed later writers from the soft slumbers of the heart and wit and humour became commodities in great request The road to fame though difficult was obvious and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller at his first outset so far to have mistaken as not to have attempted it The difficulties and dangers have increased however in a vast proportion I need only mention the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL and every discerning critic will immediately recollect how and why  In the Comedy of DUPLICITY the 'squire and his sister are characters that in their own nature cannot admit of delicate strokes and if I have erred it is not I believe so much in the colouring as in the choice of my subject An Author in his first attempt is seldom impressed with that awe for the Public which is requisite but ventures many things that perhaps have their excellencies in reading but that appear rude abrupt or indelicate when pronounced before a large assembly Were the humour of Smollet which never fails to excite laughter in the closet spoken upon the stage it would frequently excite universal disgust Characters of broad humour are become peculiarly hazardous because they are become far less frequent A sense of propriety spreads in proportion as people read and reading is an infallible consequence of riches This produced  duces delicate sensations in those who have acquired such a strict sense of propriety and they are offended when they see things represented on the stage which they suppose do not exist in real life though there are a thousand living characters a thousand incidents at which if exhibited an audience would revolt merely on the score of improbability  Whatever the execution may have been the intention of this Comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of risibility the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous and I would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gamingtable than of making a whole theatre merry  I have likewise been accused by some of imitation and want of originality It is said I have stolen an incident from one piece and a character from another and that it is evidently the play of a player This last remark I believe would never have been made had I not been known to be a player The accusations which have the greatest appearance of truth are that LE DISSIPATEUR of Monsieur Destouches and the Tragedy of THE GAMESTER have furnished the great outlines of the plot To these I answer that were it so I would make no scruple of avowing it because I should not think myself degraded by the avowal but I declare the plot was finished and almost the comedy  before I ever read LE DISSIPATEUR and if I have pillaged the GAMESTER it was from latent ideas of which I am unconscious for I have neither read nor seen the GAMESTER for many years A parallel circumstance to that of Sir Harry losing his sister's fortune is found I am told in the GAMESTER but this incident was added to DUPLICITY since it was first written by the advice of a friend to give a strength to the denoument But there is a story told in the life of Beau Nash which had these critics known would have immediately pointed out the place whence they might have sworn without the least suspicion of perjury I had stolen my plot and yet had they sworn they would have been perjured for I never read that story till I had written my Play and then I confess I was amazed at the similarity  However I repeat had I taken my plot from any play or story I should have made no scruple to confess it because I think it no disgrace The first of all poets invented none of his plots I shall never be the second and yet I affirm I did invent mine that is as far as I myself am conscious The elegant Bishop Hurd in his discourse on Poetical Imitation has the following remark among many others which is applicable to the present occasion  The objects of imitation like the materials of human knowledge are a common stock which experience  furnishes to all men and it is in the operations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry as of science consists Here the genius of the poet hath room to shew itself and from hence alone is the praise of originality to be ascertained  The Comedy is now committed to the impartial judgment of the true critic and I have only to wish it may receive as favourable a sentence from him as it has already experienced from the voice of an indulgent Public  PROLOGUE  Written by Mr NICHOLSON  and spoken by Mr LEELEWES  RASH was the wight who first in hollow'd tree  Daring resolv'd to tempt the treach'rous sea  Hungry the wretch who forth from shelly cloister  First drew and swallowed downa living oyster  But far more rash and daring is THAT wight  Who in this polish'd age attempts to write  Long may his hunger last who pines for fame  Who seeks that hardearn'd morsel call'dA NAME  A morsel clos'd within a scaly guard  Of critic shells obdurate rough and hard  Well fare the bard whose fortitude sedate  Stands unappall'd before impending fate  When catcallpipers groaners whistlers grinners  Assembled sit to judge of SCRIBBLING SINNERS  What mortal mind can keep its terrors under  When gods sit arm'd with awfulwooden thunder  What heart so brave can check its palpitation  Before the grave dispensers of damnation  Or who in danger of such mighty evil  Would not turn Indian and adore the devil  Bows  Various have been the stratagems and wiles  Display'd in prologues to obtain your smiles  Some make the stage an inn and hope to bribe  With curious feast the turtleeating tribe  Make vain attempts in metaphor to treat  But metaphor is unsubstantial meat  So bold harpooners if their oars should fail  Toss out an empty tub to amuse the whale  Others more mean implore in whining style  That tender pity may your hearts beguile  Bespeak applause by way of deprecation  And think that fame is charity's donation  So dastard curs provoke the mastiff's bite  Then fawn and cringe to shun th' unequal fight  Our author hopes by honest means to gain  Plaudits which merit never ask'd in vain  Should such biest claim be his he need not fear  He knows your candourParty dwells not here  Patient to your decision he'll submit  Nor wish to bribe

SCENE I Sir HARRY PORTLAND's House  Enter  CLARA  and  MELISSA  Clara  WELL my dear Melissa you will be a happy woman  Melissa  I have no doubt of it The attention which Mr Osborne has shewn me was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his mistress by humouring her caprices praising her beauty and flattering her follies He is obliging and wellbred but sincere yet his disapprobation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than some people's compliments  Clara  If time instead of mellowing the strokes should wear away this smooth varnish and discover a harsh outline should you not be offended at the severity of his manner think you  Melissa  Believe me dear Clara there is no danger for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is Mr Osborne  Clara  It would be heresy in you my dear to hold any other opinion and I have no doubt but you will continue orthodox after marriage  Melissa  YesI shall certainly die in that faith  Clara  Your brother Sir Harry I believe is of your religion too  Melissa  EntirelyThe friendship of Mr Osborne and my brother is as sincere as the commencement of it was remarkableHave you ever heard their story  Clara  Never You know my acquaintance with your family is but just begun but I hope you will not think them words of course when I assure you that short as it is I feel myself interested in its happiness  Melissa  Oh I am sure you are sincereI know it by sympathyWell then I'll tell youHarry and Osborne happened to be both abroad at the same time As my brother was going to Italy and passing through the mountainous part of Savoy he came to a hollow way among the rocks surrounded by trees and caverns All on a sudden at a turning in the road he beheld Osborne and his servants attacked by six banditti and ready to sink under their wounds  Clara  Was Sir Harry alone    alarmed    Melissa  He had his governor two servants and the postillionMy brother instantly leaped from his carriage snatched up his sword and pistols andflew to the place of action  Clara  I declare you terrify me  Melissa  He was not seen by the combatants and took care to advance so near before he  fired that he could not fail to do executionHe laid two of the banditti dead and their companions who had discharged their firearms and beheld Sir Harry's people running to the attack and levelling their pieces fled  Clara  Thank you for that my dearyou have given me breath  Melissa  The intrepidity with which Sir Harry saw Osborne defend himself and the fortitude he discovered when he was informed as it was at first believed that his wounds were mortal attached my brother so powerfully to him that he resolved not to leave him in the hands of strangers but anxiously waited while he was under cure  Clara  This was a noble generosity  Melissa  It was and Osborne was so sensible of it that though he was going the other way he would return with Sir Harry into Italy and their friendship has continued ever since  Clara  But is it not strange my dear that he cannot detach his friend Sir Harry from the GAMINGTABLE  Melissa  My brother is insatuatedIt is his greatest almost his only weakness  Clara  But the report is that Mr Osborne takes advantage of this weakness that while he publicly satirizes the practice he privately benefits by his superior address and in fact has half ruined Sir Harry HIMSELF  Melissa  The report of malice my dear  Enter  Sir HARRY PORTLAND  and  Mr OSBORNE  Sir  Harry  Ladies your obedientPray when did you arrive in town Madam    To Clara    Clara  YesterdayBut how came you to quit Bath so suddenly Gentlemen I understood you intended to stay another week and you were gone before me  Sir  Harry  Mr Osborne Madam was  horriblement ennuy√©  dull as an alderman at church or a fat lapdog after dinnerthinking on marriage Melissa and other momentous matters and so  Osborne  Come come Sir Harry this is mighty ingenious but you were at least as willing to be gone as myselfThe truth Madam is my MODEST friend here heard YOU were to set off in a day or two and from that moment was continually giving hints and asking me how I as a lover could exist so long without a sight of my mistress and in short began all at once to talk so sympathetically about absence and ages that I who had made the excursion purely to oblige him was I acknowledge exceedingly happy to find I could oblige him by returning  Clara  What say you to this Sir HarryBut I know your politenessyou will confess it all to be true and begin to say civil things upon the subject that will only put me to the trouble of blushing and curtsying so we'll suppose them all if you pleaseBut come tell mewhat's the news of the day  Melissa  News Oh that's trueLook here my dearI thought I had something to tell you    reads a paragraph in a newspaper      We hear from very good authority that a hymeneal treaty is concluded between a certain beautiful ward not a mile from St James's Square and her old guardian and that the lady is expected in town from Bath every hour to sign and seal  Sir  Harry  What say you to this Madam  Clara  Say I protest I don't know what to sayexcept that these NEWSMAKERS are a very pleasant ingenious kind of people  Melissa  But a'n't you angry  Clara  Angry no indeed I am sure I am very much obliged to them for thinking of meI shall be so stared atI'll go into public continually and my guardian shall go with me  Melissa  But is there any foundation for this report my dear  Clara  Nay I am sure I can't tell there may be for aught I knowI have suspected the matter a great while you must know by my guardian's simpering and sque√©zing my hand so oftenthen he is continually talking about METHUSELAH and the ANTEDILUVIANS and making systems to convince me how much stronger and longer lived some men are than othersHe read the other day in the ANNUAL REGISTER of a man at INVERNESS who lived to the age of one hundred and seventeen and he has been talking ever since of purchasing a country seat in the HIGHLANDS  Sir  Harry  That would be pleasant  Clara  VeryThen we should have a flock of GOATS I suppose  Sir  Harry  DORASTUS and FAUNIA  Clara  Oh yesquite in the DAMON and PHILIDA way  Osborne  You are very happy in a lover Madam  Clara  Exceedinglyquite proud of my conquestThere is no such great miracle in bringing a young fellow whose passions are all afloat to die at ones feetThe thing's so natural that one does it every dayBut to thaw the icy blood  of a grave old gentleman to see him simper sigh dance minuets and look ridiculous for oneOh there is positively no flattery equal to it  Sir  Harry  He will make your winter evenings in the HIGHLANDS quite entertaining with relating the wild pranks he committed and the deeds of prowess he was guilty of in his youththen you will be so delighted with listening to his raptures and tasting his panada and  Clara  Oh yesyes yesha haII think I see him now with his venerable bald head his shrivelled face and his little pug nose that looks as red and as bright as the best Dutch sealingwax rising from his chair by the help of his crutchheaded stick to breathe forth vows of love and everlasting fidelityHa ha ha  Melissa  It's whimsical enough  Clara  YesOh now you talk of whimsical I was accosted by an old gentleman the night before I left Bath in the rooms who was the drollest being and had the most agreeable kind of whimsicallity about him I ever met withI thought he would have made love to meswore I was an angel and said a thousand civil thingsquite galant  Osborne  Oh Madam the old men are the only polite men of this age  Clara  Upon my word I begin to think so  Osborne  The young ones taught in the modern school hold a rude familiarity to be the first principle of good breeding  Clara  Manners like point ruffles are now most fashionable when they are soiled  Sir  Harry  No nothey only hang the easier for being deprived of starchBut who was this old gentleman pray Madam  Clara  A relation of yours Sir  Sir  Harry  Of mine Madam  Clara  I should suppose so for he mentioned his nephew Sir Harry Portland  Melissa  Our uncle Sir Hornet Armstrong  Sir  Harry  It isI found a letter from him when I came to town in which he informed me he should arrive in Bath the very day we left it  Enter  SERVANT  Sir  Harry  Who brought this  Servant  It came by the post Sir  Exit Servant    Sir Harry reads the letter and seems surprized    Clara  I die to be better acquainted with himI must have him in my train of sighing swains  Osborne  You seem astonished Sir Harry  Clara  Some unkind billet from his mistress I suppose  Sir  Harry  No indeed it is the most unaccountable epistle I ever received and from my unaccountable uncle tooThere read read    To Osborne    Osbone  Reads  Dear Harry  You know you dog how your old uncle loves youYou will say so when you are thoroughly acquainted with the occasion of thisIn briefI met with a young lady at Bath the most extraordinary take her all together I ever beheldShe is a nonpareil a phoenixBut you will judge for yourselfShe is coming up to town with her brother who by the bye is a country boobybut that's no matterI saw her only once and that was in the rooms but once is sufficientThey intended coming up to London by way of seeing the town for the are  country people I find though the sister has more accomplishments ease and goodbreeding than I ever yet saw in the drawingroomI proposed a match to the brother and he seemed happy at the offerThey will arrive nearly as soon as this for they set out before it and I shall follow maugre the gout as fast as I can  HORNET ARMSTRONG  P S  I forgot to mention their name is Turnbull  TURNBULL why what in the devil's name is Sir Hornet mad  Sir  Harry  In one of his right antient whims I supposeSir Hornet has had many such in his time  Melissa  But pray who is this miraculous lady Mr Osborne for you seem to know something of her  Osborne  Do you remember Sir Harry a gawky girl that stalked round the rooms and stared prodigiouslyshe that was stuck to the side of a bobwig'd country 'squire  Clara  Ohwhat thethe wench with her arms dangling her chin projecting and her mouth opendressed in thered ribband tawdry stile and that looked as if she were afraid of being lost  Sir  Harry  Yesor as if she durst not trust herself alone out of her own parish lest somebody should catch her put her in a sack and send her for a present to the king of the Cannibals  Osborne  The samethat is the accomplished Miss Turnbull  Sir  Harry  How  Osborne  That is the easy wellbred drawingroom lady  Sir  Harry  Is it possible  Clara  Ha ha ha ha hawell    with an affected gravity    and I don't doubt but she would make a sort of aaa very good wifeUnderstands the arts of brewing baking pickling of pork curing of hung beef darning of stockings and other branches of housewifery in perfection  Sir  Harry  Oh no doubtIs perfectly skilled too in the science of feeding the pigs  Clara  Yesand will make her own and her husband's linen and do all the needlework and quilting at homebelieves in ghosts and has got the wandering Prince of Troy the Babes in the Wood and the entertaining dialogue of Death and the Lady by heart  Osborne  Such and so numerous are the wifelike properties of MISS BARBARA TURNBULL  Clara  TURNBULL tooWell that is such a delightful name for a country ladyso pastoral  Osborne  The father was one of the greatest graziers in the west of England and was so intent on getting money that he bred his children in the most stupid ignoranceHe is lately dead and the son has commenced gentleman and 'squire by virtue of the father's industry and a pack of foxhounds and though he has scarce knowledge enough of articulate sounds to hold a dialogue with his own geese yet does he esteem himself a devilish shrewd fellow and a witHis conversation is vociferous and patched up of proverbs and outoftheway sayings which he strings together without order or connection and utters upon all occasions and in all companies without respect to time place or person  Clara  Well well Sir Harry I shall have to wish you joy soon I supposebut I must be gonefifty visits to make this morningtime flies  butagreeable company and all that you knowOh Sir Harry you mean to attend the spring meetings this year at NewmarketI am told you understand the turfI think of sending a venture of five hundred by somebodyBut I shall see you often enough before thenAdieu  Exeunt Clara and Melissa  Manent Sir Harry and Osborne  Sir  Harry  Well what do you think of this lady Osborne  Osborne  I think her a very amiable accomplished lady and one that under an assumed levity observes and understands every thing about her  Sir  Harry  I am entirely of your opinionIf I may judge from an acquaintance of such short date she is the first woman in the world  Osborne  Except one Sir Harry  Sir  Harry  You Osborne may make exceptions if you pleaseI am not so captiousShe has beauty without vanity virtue without prudery fashion without affectation wit without malice gaiety without coquetry humour  Osborne  Hold holdstop to breatheHow was it Vinegar without acid fire without heat light without shade motion without matter and a likeness without a feature  Sir  Harry  "Spiteby the Godsproud spite and burning envy"  Osborne  But did you observe her Newmarket hint Sir Harry and the concealed significance with which it was delivered  Sir  Harry  I did  Osborne  Which being faithfully done into English bears this interpretation"I Clara Forrester a beautiful elegant sensible girl  with a fine fortune should like to take you Harry Portland with youth spirit and certain et ceteras but"  Sir  Harry  "But that I am afraid of indulging a partiality for any man who is so intolerably addicted to gaming"Is not that the conclusion of your speech  Osborne  Oh fie No no gamingThat man has a body without a soul that never felt an inclination to gaming  Sir  Harry  Perhaps so but that man has the greatest soul who can best resist that inclination  Osborne  PshawGaming is the essence of fashion and one of your strongest recommendationsClara is a girl of spirit and what girl that comes under that description would ever place her affections on a sneaking sober prudent fellowa mechanical scoundrel that knows the day of the month sips tea keeps a pew in the parish church writes memorandums and goes to bed at eleven o'clockPoh absurd  Sir  Harry  Curse me Osborne if I know what to make of youYou are a riddle that I cannot expound You have such an aukward way of praising gaming that it always has the appearance of satire  Osborne  Satire how so Do you think I'd satirize myself Who sports more freely than I do  Sir  Harry  Why there's the mysteryYou are as eager to the full as I amIf I set an hundred on a back hand you offer a thousand nay had I the fortune of a Nabob and were to stake it all you would be the first man to cry cover'd and be damned mad if any one wanted to go a guineaNot because you have not generosity but in the true and inveterate spirit of gaming  Osborne  CertainlyGamingwhy gaming is the best sal volatile for the spleenIt rouzes the spirits agitates the blood quickens the pulse and puts the whole nervous system in a continual vibrationNo man ever yet died of an apoplexy that loved a box and dice  Sir  Harry  But they have died as suddenly  Osborne  Oh ay ay but that's a fashionable disease an influenza that's to make your exit with eclat that's to go out of the world with a good report  Sir  Harry  Truetrueand indeed as to a few years more or less that is in reality a mighty insignificant circumstance  Osborne  A bagatelleLet us live while we do live and die when we can't live any longer  Sir  Harry  That's my comfortthat's my comfortYesyesa pistola pistol is a very certain remedy for the cholicNobody but a pitiful scoundrel would go sighing and whining and teizing other people with his griefs and complaintsWhen a man is weary what should he do but go to sleep  Osborne  To be sureLife itself is but a dream'Tis only sleeping a little sounder  Sir  Harry  What live to be pitiedHa haA decayed gentleman No no noA withered brancha firelock without a flintAnd yetheighothis Claradamn itits provokingYouthbeautyaffabilityshe's a bewitching girl  Osborne  She is indeed  Sir  Harry  A lovely girl  Osborne  Ayenough so to make any man that might hope to be in her favour in love with life  Sir  Harry  Any man any manbut meno noUndoneundoneundone  Osborne  Well but seriously since you have such bad success why don't you renounce play  Sir  Harry  Tis too lateI have sunk eighty thousandMy resources almost all exhausted my estates all mortgaged to Jews and scoundrels  Osborne  All  Sir  Harry  All except the estate in Kent  Osborne  Well then if you cannot content yourself with your present loss your best way will be to make another vigorous push  Sir  Harry  That's exactly what I am determined to do and unless the devil possesses the dice I think I may expect without a miracle that fortune should change hands  Osborne  One would think so indeedWill you dine then at my house There will be the Chevalier the Baron and the usual setThey have engaged to dine with meThey are spirited fellows and will play for any sum  Sir  Harry  I don't knowSuspicion is a curst meanness and yet I cannot help having my doubts of some among that companyNay had you not so often assured me you were perfectly acquainted with them all  Osborne  Why I tell you again and again so I amI will be answerable for their conduct and that's more than I would say for any other set of gamblers upon earth  Sir  Harry  Well wellI'll meet you there  Osborne  We dine earlyat five  Sir  Harry  Agreed  Osborne  And thenhey for a light heart and a heavy purse  Exit Osborne  Sir  Harry  No noNo light heart for meI am sunkdegraded in my own opinionGaming alters our very natureOsborne used to hate ithe was then an openhearted generous  fellowhe now appears to have contracted an insatiable love for money and a violent desire to winhe cares not of whomof me as soon

well profit by it as anotherI know him to have the most refined and strictest sense of honourI have lost most of my money to him and in his company and therefore have not been duped out of itThat is some comfort however  Exit  SCENE II  Enter  Mr OSBORNE  and  TIMID  Osborne  Well Mr Timid has Sir Harry sent to you for a further supply  Timid  Lackaday Sir yesAnd a very large supply tooHe wants

the moneyLackadayI told him I was no longer master of ways and means and he said then he must positively employ another prime minister for supplies he must have  Osborne  Why did you tell him that Go

mortgage of the Kentish estate  Timid  The Kentish estateLackadayBut suppose he should go to gaming and lose it to somebody else instead of you  Osborne  Oh I'll take care of that  Timid  LackadayIt

sixtysevenHave not we a thousand examples of longevity upon recordAnd thenas to cuckoldsI cannot be persuaded that they are as common now as they were when I was a youngsterTimes men and manners

Sir Hornet  Sir  Hornet  Mean my angel why here has been a bantering lying aenigmatical son of a scoundrel with a bundle of ironical diabolical tales railing at your beauty and accomplishments till egad I began to fancy my fineflavoured pineapple a crab  Clara  This is delightfulI half suspected this from the firstBut the mistake is so pleasant that I cannot find in my heart to undeceive him  aside  There is no answering for the difference of taste Sir  Sir  Hornet  TrueAsses prefer thistles to nectarinesBut yet he must be an ass indeed who could not distinguish St Paul's from the pillory  Clara  Taste Sir Hornet is a sort of shot silk and has a variety of shadesa camelionone says 'tis blue another black and a third is positive 'tis yellowevery body has it yet nobody can tell what it isLike space it is undescribable tho' all allow there is such a thingIt would be a vain attempt therefore for Miss Turnbull to endeavour to please the whole world  Sir  Hornet  An old boobyI would not give a hair of the pope's beard to please himBut how is it with Sir HarryIs HE in raptures Is HE dying for you  Clara  No Sirhe eats and drinks as usual and is for aught I can discover in tolerable good health  Sir  Hornet  Is hean audacious dogin good healthIf I find him in good health I'll pistol himBut you mistake the matter perhapsThe rascal's proud and not willing you should see his sufferingsHe is a stricken deer and sheds his tears in solitude and silence mayhapDo you discover no symptoms of the sighing swainDoes he never cut his fingersor scald himselfor run against a post and beg its pardon  Clara  No Sir  Sir  Hornet  I doubt he is a sad dogBut nono noI am certain he adores you'Tis impossible he should do otherwiseBut there is another material point about which I am not quite so certain  Clara  What is that Sir  Sir  Hornet  Has he found any place in your affections'Tis true he's a fine fellowI don't mean by that one that is pickled in cosmeticspreserved in musk and marechal powder and that will melt away like Lot's wife in the first hard showerNone of your fellows that are too valiant to give a woman the wall and too witty to let her have the last wordBut one that isIn short his own manner will best describe what he is  Clara  True Sir Hornet but the time has been so short  Sir  Hornet  ShortAh Madam if he did not do the business with a  coup d'oeil  at onceI would not give a feather of a goosewing for all the arrows his Cupid has in his quiverBut come Miss TurnbullI know you are above the silly prejudices that ordinary minds are swayed by  tell me sincerelyHas he made any impression on your heartIs he the man  Clara  To speak ingenuously Sir Hornet that is a point entirely undetermined at present  Sir  Hornet  Undeterminedwhywhat  Clara  Sir Harry's person is engaging his manners delightful and his understanding unexceptionable  Sir  Hornet  Bravo my dear girlyou charm me to hear you say so  Clara  I will say more Sir HornetI find my heart interested in his behalf and sincerely believe I shall never see another man with whom I could be half so happy  Sir  Hornet  My dear Miss Turnbull  Clara  But yet I have too many reasons to fear it will be impossible we should ever be united  Sir  Hornet  Impossible  Clara  I do most firmly believe Sir Harry possesses a thousand virtues but they are all tinged discoloured by a failing which if not in its own nature as erroneous as some other vices is more destructive than any  Sir  Hornet  I understand you  Clara  This will for ever deter a woman who values her own peace and welfare from cherishing a passion that must in its consequences be so fatal  Sir  Hornet  But you my angel will soon cure him of thisIt is not a rooted vice  Clara  Permanentlyor my intelligence says falseWhen he loses there is no possibility of persuading him to desistthe recollection of his loss preys upon his mind and had he the Indies he would set it upon the chance of a card the turn of a guinea or the cast of a die  Sir  Hornet  Well but we have hopes that Mr Osborne will find means to reclaim himhe is  continually with him continually warning him and  Clara  Subtlety and refined artificeMr Osborne Sir Hornet is an interested physician and would rather encourage than cure the disease  Sir  Hornet  Heaven forbidBut who informs you of this  Clara  Those who are in the secret I assure you SirI am afraid Mr Osborne is a wicked manHe iswhat I dare not speak  Sir  Hornet  I confess you alarm me tho' I hope without causeOsborne assumes every appearance of rigid virtue and if this were true he would be the worst of villainsHowever suspend your opinion awhileI'll soon sift the affairAnd in the mean time let me beg of you to think as well of Sir Harry as your doubts will permit you  Clara  I shall do that Sir Hornet without an effort  Exit  Enter  VANDERVELT    Sees Clara going off on the other side of the Stage    Vandervelt  Why turtlewhyAh Sir HornetI am glad to

And I'll tell you a story  Vandervelt  Do  Sir  Hornet  There was a certain antient personage of my acquaintance called Andrew Vandervelt  Vandervelt  What's your story about me  Sir  Hornet  Give me leave young gentleman and you shall hearEvery body imagined him to be a prudent sedate grave person with a moderate share of common sense  Vandervelt  Well  Sir  Hornet  And as it was evident his beard was grey his limbs palsied his skin shriveled and his sinews shrunk  Vandervelt  How Sir Hornet  Sir  Hornet  They naturally concluded he had made his will wrote his epitaph and bespoke his coffin  Vandervelt  Mercy upon me  Sir  Hornet  But instead of meditating like a pious Christian on the four last things a crotchet takes him in the head he buys a threepenny fiddle scrapes a matrimonial jigg claps a pair of horns upon his head and curvets thro' the town  the sport of the mob derided by the young pitied by the old and laughed at by all the world  Vandervelt  Heaven deliver me what a picture But you forget Sir HornetDidn't I explain to you that it was only a joke  Sir  Hornet  Oh trueAh witty roguewelladieuI'll remember the jokeha ha ha  Vandervelt  Ay doha ha ha  Sir

Harry and Miss Turnbull walk up the stage in conversation    Sir  Hornet  Finding you inZounds what aukward cargo of rusticity has he got there    To Clara    Clara  A young lady from Somersetshire with a tolerable good fortune that Sir Harry it is thought by some intends to marry  Sir  Hornet  MarryHe should as soon marry the mummy of queen Semiramis  Clara  She has been strongly recommended to the family Sir  Sir  Hornet  RecommendedBy whom  Clara  By one you are very intimate with and who has very great influence with Sir Harry as well as with yourself  Sir  Hornet  AyWho is that  Clara  Pardon me there Sir Hornet  Sir  Hornet  Certainly the fellow cannot be foolish enough to admire herbut I shall soon discover that by what he thinks of youharkee Harry  Sir  Harry  Sir  Sir  Hornet  I cannot upon the whole tell very well what to make of youAre you thoroughly convinced that you are at this instant legally capable of making your will  Sir  Harry  My will Sir  Sir  Hornet  AyAre you of sound mind  Sir  Harry  I believe so Sir  Sir  Hornet  Then pray tell me now we have you face to face what is your opinion of Miss Turnbull  Sir  Harry  SirThat is by no means a question proper to be answered in this company  Sir  Hornet  PshawDamn your delicacyMake your panegyric and I'll blush for her and you too  Sir  Harry  Shrugs up his shoulders  Sir I have no panegyric to make  Sir  Hornet  Sir  Sir  Harry  Even so  Sir  Hornet  Why you impudent confoundedHave you the barefaced effrontery with such a picture before your eyes to  Sir  Harry  You have applied the torture and my own ease requires confession  Sir  Hornet  HumphAnd so youNow pray all be attentive for Bacon's brazen head is going to utterSo you do not think Miss Turnbull a most engaging  Sir  Harry  Smiles  Sir  Hornet  Why you intolerable  Sir  Harry  I am concerned to see you so serious on the subjectI must acknowledge that in this case Sir I have either a most perverse or stupid imagination and cannot for the soul of me discover the latent wonders in the young lady which your better sight has so distinct a view of  Sir  Hornet  Ha  Sir  Harry  I am however exceedingly willing to try the utmost strength of my faith to believe as much as I can and take the rest for granted provided you will not inflict the punishment of a wife upon my superstition  Sir  Hornet  Obliging youth    Bows    inflict the punishment of a wife upon your superstitionAnd so you think no doubt a wife a burthen much too heavy for the back of so fine and pretty a townmade gentleman as yourfelf  Sir  Harry  With the addition of Miss Turnbull's accomplishments I most undoubtedly do Sir  Sir  Hornet  You dohumphPray most civil Sirpermit me to askperhaps there may be some other lady in this good company to whom your profound penetration would give the preference  Sir  Harry  If such preference could in the least make me deserving of her I have no scruple to say there is  Sir  Hornet  Miracle of modestythere is  Sir  Harry  Most assuredlyBut tho' to possess the lady you hint at would make me blest beyond description I have never dared to declare so much before because I am conscious of being unworthy of such a prosusion of charms and accomplishments  Clara  Generous diffidence    aside    Sir  Hornet  Charms andWhat the devil is all thisWhere am Iat sea or on shoreHave I a calenture in my brain or is this my noseTheythey call you Sir Harry Portland don't they Sir  Sir  Harry  And your nephew Sir  Sir  Hornet  Nothat's rather dubiousWell then Mr Harry or Sir Harry or what you pleaseYou are pretty well convinced I suppose that I HAVE had some slight regard for you  Sir  Harry  Perfectly Sir and remember it with gratitude  Sir  Hornet  That remains to be proved friendEver since your father's death if I don't mistake I have been tolerably busy a little active  or so in forming your mind and manners and moulding you into a sort of being a man might behold without blushing  Sir  Harry  It is impossible Sir I should ever forget your goodness tho' I am happy to be reminded of it  Sir  Hornet  That's a lie I believeHowever Siramong the rest of my cares I was anxious to find a woman worthy of youNay so solicitous was I about adjusting preliminaries that tho' the gout had laid an embargo upon a parcel of my fingers and toes I resolved to forego my own ease and set sail immediately that I might convoy you sase into the harbour of happiness  Sir  Harry  I am very sensible of the benevolence of your intentions Sir and only wish you had done me the honour to  Sir  Hornet  Well I have only a word or two more to say on the subjectI have been an enthusiastic old blockhead 'tis true and was fool enough to think all men had eyes however if you have not either the complaisance the wit or the love to hit upon some expedient to make your peace with Miss Turnbull I will never see never know never speak to you again And now Sir you will act as your great wisdom shall direct  Sir  Harry  Indeed Sir I am distressed to see you so intent upon this busines I am exceedingly unhappy to do the least thing to incur your displeasureat this moment especiallyI have a thousand reasons to be disatisfied with myself and am grieved to add your anger to the liftI would do any thing in my power to preserve your friendship and affection but this is too severe a taskI cannot totally forget common senseI cannot entirely command so delicate a passion as that of loveA little time will discover  whether I am ever to think of love or happiness againOf this however I am certainI never can possess either with Miss Turnbull  Exit Sir Harry  Sir  Hornet  Indeed youngster so resolute  Clara  What a noble fortitude    aside    Sir  Hornet  We shall see who will first read their

Why true as you say friend Van but that happens to be a blunder which I never did nor ever could make I should as soon take myself for a king or you for a conjuror I only mistook this lady to be Miss Turnbull not Miss Turnbull to be this lady  Vandervelt  Mistook Miss Turnbull and this lady andI don't understand it  Clara  Be kind enough Sir Hornet to explain the matter  Sir  Hornet  You remember Madam I had some conversation with you in the rooms at Bath  Clara  Persectly  Sir  Hornet  And you could not but perceive how forcibly I was struck with your wit beauty and accomplishments  Clara  I recollect you were very polite Sir and were pleased to say abundance of obliging things  Sir  Hornet  Not half so many as I thought I assure you Madam  Vandervelt  Well said Sir HornetMy old friend is quite enamoured with you turtle  Sir  Hornet  Yes Sir so I amthough I do not intend to marry the lady  Vandervelt  Hem  Sir  Hornet  My grand object the thing that of all others I have most at heart is to see my nephew Sir Harry happyAs for myself I feel I am growing old apace and am almost tired of the farce of life  Vandervelt  Why so Sir Hornet I am sure you play your part excellently  Sir  Hornet  No noI am rolling down hill apace and as the first steep declivity may precipitate me to the bottom there are certain affairs I wish to see finished one of which is the marriage of Sir Harry  Clara  So the person you asked concerning me when I went out of the rooms mistook the question and thought you meant Miss Turnbull  Sir  Hornet  So it appears madamAnd I was too much enraptured to stay to rectify mistakeswhen I negotiated the affair with 'Squire Turnbull I studiously avoided an interview with his supposed sister for fear the business should wear a face of precipitate indelicacyAnd I thought if I could once bring you and Sir Harry together I would leave the contingent possibilities to love and the superior good qualities and penetration of the parties  which I rationally enough concluded could not fail to produce the desired effect  Clara  But Sir Hornet how did it happen that you did not enquire of me myself who I was  Sir  Hornet  Why faith madam I had been so particular with you and had spoken so freely on the subjects of love and matrimony that I was afraid if I made those kind of enquiries you would mistake the matter perhaps and think I wanted to make love to you in my own proper person Hey young Van    half aside    Vandervelt  Heigho  Clara  Oh no Sir HornetI assure you I had a better opinion of your understanding  Vandervelt  Hem  Sir

to you who must LIVE to feel the effect of your vices and bear unjustly the reproach of your abandoned conduct  Sir  Harry  Oh torture  Osborne  Was it not enough that you had reduced yourself from affluence and honour to contempt and beggary but you must wantonly wickedly sport with what was not your own  and involve the innocent and unborn in your wretchednessShall not your sister's offspring

there was an estate to be scrambled for and every one was industrious to obtain a shareAfter squandering a part of his fortune among these adventurers he engaged at play with me and after losing one

Proscribe VINGT UNEprohibit box and dice  Tell YOU of honour infamy undoing  Andimpudently preach you out of ruin  Are cards and dice fit subjects for his fables    laughs    He'd better write a tragedy on E O tables  And why with so much rudeness and illnature  'Gainst PRIVATE vice urge acrimonious satire  Since legal lotteries flourish every year  And peers and pedlars run the mad career  Of public ruin in its full extent  And beggars gameBY ACT OF PARLIAMENT  Nay once in seven years in full perfection  Is play'd a game more desp'rate call'd "ELECTION"  When each grave senator the cause promotes  And throws the main withcogg'd and loaded votes  When honour conscience justice law religion  Are ev'ry one by turns the plunder'd pigeon  But wherefore rail at games in any station  Life is itself a game at calculation  In which Dame Fortune gains but little thanks  For each man swears HIS prizes are all blanks  So when your am'rous lover draws for wife  And wit and beauty link with him for life  Tho' twice ten thousand vows of love were paid  To gain the charmingdearangelic maid  Tho' constancy and raptures were the theme  Let but possession chace the honey'd dream  His bouncing passion bursts like bonfire squib  And wit and beauty formA CROOKED RIB  The lordly husband takes a different tone  When once sweet Miss becomes "bone of his bone"  The tender epithet the dying leer  Are chang'd to"Damme Madam can't you hear"  For these poor authors who their pens employ  To write down pleasures which they can't enjoy  You against whom they aim their boldest strokes  Have too much NONCHALANCE to mind their jokes  You find them soporifics quite composing  For all the while they're preaching you are dozing  Our bard who full of antiquated notions  Intends to cure the world by scenic potions  Gravely resolves to set the nation right  If your applause should crown his hopes to night
