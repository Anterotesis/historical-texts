THE COUNCIL WITH THE OPINION OF THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH ON CAUSE SHEWN Why an Information should not be exhibited against JOHN STEPHEN JAMES JOSEPH CLARKE Esqrs RALPH ALDUS Attorney at Law WILLIAM AUGUSTUS MILES JAMES SPARKS and THOMAS LEIGH FOR A RIOTOUS CONSPIRACY FOUNDED In private premeditated Malice to deprive CHARLES MACKLIN one of the Comedians belonging to the Theatre Royal in COVENT GARDEN of his Livelihood by forcibly compelling the acting Manager of the said Theatre against his Will to discharge the said CHARLES MACKLIN for ever therefrom formally and publicly on the Stage of the said Theatre  Homo sum nihil humani a me alienum puto  TER  BY A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD  LONDON Sold by J WILLIAMS No Fleet Street  MDCCLXXIV  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PREFACE  AS I consider myself in the Meaning of my Motto  an humane Man and that no Act of Humanity is a Stranger to my Heart  I could not resist a natural Impulse to publish the following Sheets inasmuch as they will tend I hope wish and believe to remove the unjust Prejudices that have been most wantonly and cruelly taken against a Man and that too with an avowed Purpose to represent him as an  "ancient outlawed Felon who was said to have  Caput lupinum  and might be knocked on the Head like a Wolf by any one who should meet him  because  having renounced all Law he was to be dealt with as in a State of Nature when any one who should find him might slay him"  But as Mr  Macklin hath not renounced all Law  and as  "now to avoid the Imputation of the Inhumanity above complained of it is holden that no Man can kill such Outlaw wantonly or wilfully"  he seems as well intitled to the Protection of the Law of  England  as any other liege Subject  If it was high Treason against the Majesty of the  PUBLIC  for a poor ignorant insulted Player deluded by mistaking a  British  Audience from their Treatment of him for Barbarians hunting down a Beast of Prey to become indignant so indignant at such Treatment and at not being heard in his own Defence and to happen to be so far lost in an unguarded Moment in such a Scene as to express an improper and imprudent Agitation of Mind by Looks or Gesture if such Deportment in such a Situation could I say be considered as high Treason what must one think of Gentlemen who though liberally educated and conversant in the Laws of their Country yet with these Advantages and cool and dispassionate after serious Reflection and mature Consideration should assert in the public Papers that they had been  "ill used and robbed by Russians Mr Macklin's Friends that they scarcely suffered them to escape with their Lives and that Mr Macklin was privy to the Cause of their Complaints"  and such malevolent Assertion be besides unsupported either by Proof or Reason but on the contrary alledged merely on  own  selfcreated  Surmises and the Charges made on Purpose to encrease the public Resentment against an unfortunate and much injured Individual If nothing but a Dismission from all Employment an utter Deprivation of Bread could atone for the  Player  's presuming to doubt or disbelieve the equivocal  I may  safely  swear in  an extrajudicial  Manner because no Perjury can be  legally  assigned on  such false  swearing when I do not  actually  hiss that  I did not hiss  and I may as  safely  make a Noise so exactly similar to Hissing in  Point of Sound  as not to be distinguished from it especially when such Attempt becomes necessary for the Purpose of disturbing an Audience distressing an Actor answering a  partilar  End or making a NewsPaper Affidavit in short  qui vult decipi decipiatur  Affidavits of two ingenious  Participes Criminis solemnly  declaring to the Public that they did  not hiss  What then I say can atone for  Gentlemen  riotously conspiring induced thereto from private premeditated Malice to damn without Redemption an helpless exposed Player by Accusations of capital Felony as false as they were public  Macklin  was most grosly and inhumanly abused insulted and proscribed and had it not been for the Laws of  England  would have been totally ruined To them he hath appealed  they have heard his Complaint and declare him entitled to Relief  The  Town  give out that a Player hath dared to dispute the undoubted Right of a British Audience founded on immemorial Custom to approve or disapprove any Actor or theatrical Exhibition by the usual Mode of Clapping or Hissing The Charge is denied and it is  only  humbly contended that the meanest Subject even a Player a Servant of the Public or a Vagabond who being liable to Punishment is also intitled to Protection hath a legal Right to be heard against being for ever deprived of his Livelihood though such Attempt were made by the first Personages in the Kingdom or by Majesty itself if that were possible and that Riots Conspiracies and Malice are all odious to and punishable by the Spirit as well as the Letter of the Laws of  England  THE EDITOR'S ADDRESS TO THE TOWN  The Reader will be pleased to observe that I here speak of the  Town  not of the  Public  my opinion of whom is that they are generous candid and merit all the Submission Respect and Disposition to please them which the Players profess every theatrical Evening and that not by  sawning or cringing  but by a proper Demeanor arising from a sincere conscientious and grateful Acknowledgment of the  public  Indulgence Favor and Protection    THough I care not whether you approve this Publication or not I have however been weak and foolish enough to endeavour to command your Attention For to address you

of Maturity because your Folly then becomes more serious and Dotage marks your old Age you speak without Thinking you act without Meaning and you assume the Authority to judge  because you have the

GENUINE ARGUMENTS  c  Trinity Term GEO III  B R  SATURDAY June THE KING On the Prosecution of CHARLES MACKLIN AGAINST JOHN STEPHEN JAMES Esquire and Others  THE Rule  Nisi  obtained in this Cause was read and is as follows  viz  Monday  next after  five  Weeks from the Feast Day of  Easter  in the th Year of King  George  the Third  Middlesex  It is ordered  That the  fifth  Day of next Term be peremptorily further given to  John Stephen James Joseph Clarke  Esquires  Ralph Aldus  Gentleman  William Augustus Miles Thomas Leigh  and  James Sparks  to shew Cause why an Information should not be exhibited against  them for certain Conspiracies Riots and Misdemeanors upon the Undertaking of the said Defendants that if such Information should be granted they will appear thereto immediately and it is further  ordered  that all Affidavits on Behalf of the said Defendants be filed four Days before the next Term  On the Motion of Mr  Wallace  Lord  Mansfield  Chief Justice Who shews Cause  Mr  Wallace  I shew Cause for  Aldus  Mr  Bearcroft  I shew Cause for  James  Mr S  Davy  I shew Cause for  Sparks  Mr  Mansfield  I shew Cause for  Clarke  Mr  Norton  I am for  Miles  Mr  Buller  I am for  Leigh  Mr  Dunning  Your Lordship is fully apprized of the Charge and of the Nature of the Answers here are six Defendants and six Council  Lord  Mansfield  I see they defend as not knowing each other and taking the Charge separate  Mr Serjeant  Davy  It is soand it is sworn in the Affidavits they never saw one another and were as much Strangers to one another as I am to them  Lord  Mansfield  There is a Charge against the Man who brought the Body into the HouseLet him begin  Mr  Buller  That Man was in  Ireland  at the Time the Rule was granted and is not come back  Lord  Mansfield  Then he don't shew Cause have they served him in  Ireland  Mr  Dunning  to Mr  Buller  You upon his Behalf then enlarged the Rule against him it was enlarged upon his Behalf  Lord  Mansfield  That is enough  Mr  Buller  I mentioned there being a Probability of his coming Home and therefore I enlarged the Rule as to him otherwise it would be impossible for him to appear he being in  Ireland  long before the Rule obtained it was a SlipThere is an Affidavit of his then being in  Ireland  Lord  Mansfield  Mr  Buller  says it was a Slip if it was enlarged as he had then an Affidavit that  Leigh  was in  Ireland  at the Time the Rule was granted what do you say to that Mr  Dunning  Mr  Dunning  My Lord I am not satisfied there was any such SlipI am not satisfied there was any such AffidavitIf your Lordship observes the Rule was enlarged by Mr  Wallace  for three he being Council now for one and it was enlarged by Mr  Buller  for three he being now likewise for one at that Time there was no Distinction made between them the Rule was to be enlarged for all  Lord  Mansfield  to Mr  Buller  You must bring an Affidavit of the Fact and make a special Case to have it argued why this general Rule should not prevail against  Leigh  among the rest  Mr  Butler  There is no Affidavit of Service upon himthey could not serve him  Lord  Mansfield  Then why did you enlarge the Rule  Mr Serjeant  Davy  I had no Brief in the Business at the Time the Gentlemen  refer toIn the last Term I had a Brief brought me to shew Cause for  Leigh  and  Sparks  I was astonished to find when I had read it quite through that there was nothing said of Mr  Leigh  or on his Behalf as there was an Affidavit by his Wife of his AbsenceUpon looking into the Rule and finding it enlarged generally I enquired and did not understand any Body was particularly Council for  Leigh  at the Time the Rule was enlarged  Mr  Davenport  Mr  Wallace  enlarged the Rule to this Term for  Miles Clarke  and  Aldus  and Mr  Buller  for  Leigh Sparks  and  James  Lord  Mansfield  It certainly was so  Mr  Buller  We can prove it was a MistakeA Slip  Mr  Dunning  I apprehend it was no Mistake of Mr  Buller's  but of the Instructions brought to him  Lord  Mansfield  He must have had Instructions to enlarge the Rule as to those three  Mr  Dunning  I heard Mr Serjeant  Davy  say just now that his Brief instructs him to defend  Leigh  and  Sparks  Mr  Blake  I sent a Letter to Mr  Leigh  to inform him of it he has not returned me an AnswerI have an Affidavit of his being out of the Kingdom before the Rule was granted  Mr  Macklin  My Lord That  Leigh  was in  London  when the Rule was served can be proved  Mr  Blake  We will put the whole upon that Mr  Macklin  if you please  Mr  Dunning  Mr  Macklin  will be so good as to recollect where we areYour Lordship sees what a Situation we should have been inwe should have lost the Vacation which might have been employed in serving himthe enlarging the Rule upon his Behalf subjects him to stand this Day and shew Cause and if what has been already done is not to be taken for Servic he never will be served  Lord  Mansfield  They don't deny it was enlarged with regard to him and meant to be enlarged upon his Part Mr  Buller  says candidly and fairly he thought  Leigh  would have been over and that he got it enlarged upon that Supposition  Mr Serjeant  Davy  Certainly I can shew no Cause for  Leigh  Lord  Mansfield  Are you all afraid of beginning can't you agree who shall begin  Mr  Bearcroft  My Lord I am not afraid to begin for Mr  James  the first in the RuleIn Point of Form I ought to beginIn Point of Substance I ought to be the last for Mr  James  has very little to do in this Business in Proportion with some of the rest but as he is brought upon the Stage in this Character by Mr  Macklin  he must perform his Part and when the Court come to see his Behaviour if they don't dismiss him with Applause they will dismiss him at least without any CensureIn order to understand Mr  James'  Case since Mr  Macklin  's Affidavits have not been read it is necessary for me shortly to state what they contain upon this Charge and it is material to attend to the particular Times in which  James  is charged to be active in this Business Mr  Macklin  and his Friend Mr  Kavenhuller Skinner  say that upon the th of  November  last Mr  James  together with Mr  Aldus  an Attorney at Law was very violent at the Head of a Party  in the two Shilling Gallery of  Covent Garden  Theatre that they and their Party were the chief Persons who made the Disturbance and there is this particular Charge against  James  that he insisted a Mr  Smith  one of the Actors of the said Theatre should perform the Part of  Macbeth  which was to have been exhibited that Evening Then Mr  Macklin  and Mr  Skinner  say likewise that upon the th of said  November  Mr  James  appeared again at the said Theatre in Concert with Mr  Aldus  and Mr  Miles  in Consequence of a Conspiracy together and that they made a violent Riot and it is expressly charged that  James  among others called upon Mr  Macklin  to kneel down upon the Stage and ask PardonThese are the Charges against Mr  James  for whom I am concerned with some general Allegations to inflame and Mr  Macklin  asserts in his Affidavit that he believes the sole Cause of his Discharge from the Theatre was occasioned by and owing to these riotous Proceedings I have an Affidavit of Mr  James  which if I am not very much mistaken totally  exculpates him from any Thing of the Sort charged By the Information in this Causethough perhaps Mr  James  was not so perfectly quiet as he could now wish he had been yet your Lordships will find upon his Affidavit that he did nothing more than is done every Day when an Auditor does not like an Actorhe tells you he was there when Mr  Macklin  himself does not introduce himhe has no Reluctance in telling how often he attended the Exhibition of  Macbeth  and the whole of his Conduct while therehe tells your Lordship that he went there upon the th of said  November  when he is not charged with being therehe says he went in Company with his Wife that may satisfy your Lordship he meant to be quiet for to procure Quiet at Home he took his Wife with him and went into the two Shilling Gallery he did not mean to make a Riot having his Wife with him and it might be well if every Person's Wife was as quiet as Mr  James  's But your Lordship will find there was another lady a Lady  Macbeth  who was not so quiet in this Business for she thought proper  to act in the Character her Husband was that Night to perform therefore she was not quite so quietand her Husband instead of performing the Character of  Macbeth  chose to exhibit a great Part of his own CharacterInstead of going on with the Play he produced a vast Number of News Papers with which he was disposed to act his Part in the Cause and appealing to them was his Method of acting till Mr  Dunning  took the Character from him who will act much better for him if he will let him alone thus the Cause was taken from the Audience which seemed to be an Accusation thrown out against  Macklin  of saying that a Mr  Reddish  had hissed him it seems Mr  Macklin  appealed to the News Papers and charged Mr  Reddish  and Mr  Sparks  with having hissed him This Charge Mr  Reddish  and the other denied in the public Papers by Affidavits sworn before my Lord Mayor or some Justice of the Peace Mr  Macklin  was angry that he had thrown out a false Charge and in order to exculpate himself was prepared with Papers when he  came upon the Stage and was going to enter upon his Exculpation and that produced the first RiotMost of the Audience disapproved of Mr  Macklin  's Proceedings in this Business and tho' it was his own Appeal to the Public yet he did not chuse to have Mr  James  and the others shew their Disapprobation by Hissing which is the usual manner upon such Applications either Hissing or Clapping that was all that passed upon the th of  November  then upon the th the Time when it is charged that Mr  James  was at the Theatre the Question then arose whether Mr  Macklin  had not been extremely wrong in this false Charge upon Mr  Reddish  and others and it was the Judgment of the House that he had and Mr  James  was in Truth one of those judges who was of Opinion it was improper Behaviour and Mr  Macklin  was called upon for some Concessions for that he had been in the wrongMr  James  says he sat in the two Shilling Gallery and that he with the rest called out for a Concession for this bad Behaviour of  Macklin  's which he had no sooner done than a Lady who sat some little Distance  from him started up and immediately struck Mr  James  This Signal it seems was to be given together with the Expression the Lady made use of  "this is one of the Scoundrels who hissed"  or to that Effect upon which a Man started up and seconded the Lady being close by her and immediately struck Mr  James  upon this a Scuffle and a third Person arose and struck Mr  James  this seems to be rather unfortunate for Mr  James  for if he did wrong he was very well punished upon the Spot without having the Punishment of this Courtthey tumbled him between two Benches and one or two got upon him and beat him Your Lordship may conceive the Consequences might have been very serious to himHe says he had a Suspicion who this Virago Lady that begun the Business was he supposed her to be a Relation of Mr  Macklin  's and he defined a Friend of his who appeared in the Gallery to follow this Lady Home to see who she was he found out the House she went to which had the Name  Macklin  upon the Door Every one believes the Lady who begun this Assault  upon Mr  James  was Mrs  Macklin  Wife of Mr  Macklin  who makes this Application The present Question is whether or no there was a concerted Design and Conspiracy between these Parties to hurt Mr  Macklin  This would be a bad Business indeed and every Person must feel it soBut Mr  James  denies the Charge in these Terms  viz  that he had not the least Knowledge before of Mr  Aldus  or any of the rest and absolutely denies that he called upon Mr  Smith  to perform in the Character of  Macbeth  instead of Mr  Macklin  or for any Purpose whatsoeverand though Mr  Macklin  has been too hot and hasty in charging Mr  James  with making use of those Expressions they are material Expressions perhaps and material to be denied for they enter into the very Purpose supposed to be a Preface to the Proceedings of the rest of these Persons by calling upon Mr  Smith  to perform the Part of  Macbeth  this he fully deniesHe is charged with hissing hooting and abusing every Person near him but he puts a Negative upon this by his Affidavit wherein he shews the  Usage he received from the Hands of Mrs  Macklin  and her FriendsHe says the next Morning he waited upon Mr  Coleman  the acting Manager of the Playhouse to procure an Interview with Mr  Macklin  in order to find out from whom he received those Blows that he did not mean to prosecute with respect to her but would put up with the Blows he received from her Mr  Coleman  took a great deal of Pains to procure a Meeting between  Macklin  and  James  to have the Matter explained But your Lordship will find that was diligently avoided by Mr  Macklin  tho' he had full NoticeNow supposing for a Moment that Mr  James  himself was at all to blame will your Lordship grant an Information upon the Application of this Mr  Macklin  from whose Wife and two of his Friends for those Men must be taken for his Friends if Mr  James  had behaved at all ill he receiv'd ample Punishment from their Hands such as I have before represented and when Mr  Macklin  refused to meet him or to assist him in his Enquiry after these Persons I should submit that would be  a Ground for refusing this Information to Mr  Macklin  The Court requires when an Application is made to them for an Information for a Riot or a Breach of the Peace or other bad Behaviour that there should be nothing of the Sort on the Part of the Person who makes the Application Another Charge against Mr  James  is that he roared out for Mr  Macklin  to kneel down upon his Knees and that he menaced Mr  Macklin  with his Stick or Cane that is a material Charge and material to be denied that is denied in the fullest Manner in the World He absolutely denies in Words that he roared out to Mr  Macklin  to down upon his Knees or menaced Mr  Macklin  with his Stick as charged in the Affidavitfor Deponent positively swears he had no Stick or Cane whatever with him that Evening that is material the Truth is no more than this they must have taken some other Person to be himNow with respect to the Conspiracy between these Parties to do the Mischief which is the material Part there is the most absolute and positive Denial that can be in any  Form of WordsMr  James  says he was there upon the th of  November  that he was a perfect Stranger to  William Augustus Miles James Sparks Joseph Clarke Ralph Aldus  and  Thomas Leigh  or any or either of them to drive the said Mr  Macklin  from the Stage nor had any Meeting with any Person or Persons whatever for that Purpose nor desired any Person to expell the said  Macklin  from the StageAll this Deponent wanted was for him to answer for his Conduct relating to those Charges against Mr  Reddish  and Mr  Sparks  and that was the whole of the Business and denies that he was in any Conspiracy or knew of any Conspiracy against Mr  Macklin  That with respect to himself he has been sufficiently ill used and more than sufficiently punished at the Time through the Behaviour of the Wife of Mr  Macklin  for if there was any Cause of Revenge she and her two Assistants fully revenged the Cause while my Client was down between the two Benches therefore my Lord I conceive this is a full Answer to the Charge and that your Lordship will not make the Rule absolute against Mr  James  Mr JAMES's Affidavit read in Court  The Affidavit of JOHN STEPHEN JAMES  Esq  sworn the th of  May    SAITH That on the th of  November  last to the best of Deponent's Knowledge and Belief as to the Time Deponent went in Company with his Wife to Covent Garden Theatre to see the Tragedy of  Macbeth  wherein Mr  Charles Macklin  was to perform the Part of  Macbeth  being the third Time of his appearing in that Character saith They were in the two Shilling Gallery and that before the beginning of the Play Mr  Macklin  came on the Stage with a large Parcel of Papers in his Hands which he began to read the Purport of which was to prove that Mr  Reddish  and Mr  Sparks  had hissed him the first Night of his performing said Part of  Macbeth  saith That on hearing same read it appeared to Deponent that there was no sufficient Proof of either said  Reddish  or  Sparks  hissing neither did Deponent  think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of said  Reddish  and  Sparks  which they had respectively made denying that said  Reddish  had hissed on the d of  October  Copies whereof were inserted in the News Papers and Deponent did therefore disapprove of said  Macklin  's Behaviour by the common Mode of Hissing and faith nothing more particular passed that Evening and the Play was heard through during the Performance of which Deponent applauded or hissed as he approved or disapproved  Saith That on th of same  November  Deponent went to said Theatre to see the Tragedy of  Macbeth  being the fourth Time of Mr  Macklin  's performing said Character and sat in the two Shilling Gallery saith that as said  Macklin  had not produced the positive Proof of  Reddish  and  Spark  's hissing as he pledged himself to the Public to do Deponent as well as many others call'd out for such Proof or a Concession And saith that on his calling out for such Proof or Concession a Woman  some little Distance from Deponent started up and struck Deponent and said  "This is one of the Scoundrels who hissed"  or used Words to that Effect on which a Man who appeared to be sitting next her immediately started up and also struck Deponent who returned his Blows and continued so to do till his Companions took him away  Saith That some little Time after said Fray happened but during the Performance of said Play as Deponent was endeavouring to find out said Man who had struck him a Gentleman whom Deponent has not the least Knowledge of pointed out the Man who had struck him and told Deponent if he was looking for the Man who had struck him that was him or Words to that Effect saith upon his going up to the said Person who had so struck him another Man immediately rose up and struck Deponent which Blow was followed by several others from several persons who were sitting near said Man who had first struck  Deponent and Deponent was knocked down between the two Benches and some Person or Persons stamped on Deponent's Breast and other Parts of his Body and saith if his Friends who went with him and some other Gentlemen had not interposed and prevented said Persons from continuing their ill Usage to him the Consequence would have proved very dangerous to Deponent  Saith that immediately after he had been so released from the disagreeable Situation he was in between the two Benches he went into the Passage of the said Gallery where he was addressed by a Gentleman who informed him he was a Patentee of said Theatre and whom Deponent believes and has been since informed was Mr  Dagge  and desired Deponent to give him his Address which Deponent did and then said he had heard Deponent had been used very ill and pointed to a Person who he said was the Constable of the Theatre and had Orders from him to take out any Person or Persons whom  Deponent should fix on who had used him ill  Saith he then went into the Gallery with the Constable to search for the first Man who had struck Deponent but could not find him and on his coming into the Gallery with the Constable he observed the Woman who had struck him rising from her Seat to go out and as Deponent was following her with a View of finding out who she was Deponent met Mr  Lucas  of  Charing Cross  who was then coming into the Gallery on which Deponent desired Mr  Lucas  to watch said Woman Home which he accordingly did and said  Lucas  returned to said Theatre in about twenty Minutes and informed Deponent that he had followed her into a House in  James Street Covent Garden  with the Name of  Macklin  on the Door and therefore Deponent at that Time verily believed and doth now believe that said Woman who struck Deponent first and whom said  Lucas  followed to said House on the Door of which House was wrote  Macklin  to be Mrs  Macklin  Wife of said  Charles Macklin  Saith that being so ill used in the Theatre he was obliged to quit same during the Time the fifth Act was performing  Denies being at the Head of or forming any Party or Parties against Mr  Macklin  's performing said Character of  Macbeth  on said th  November  and absolutely denies having at that Time the least Knowledge of Mr  Ralph Aldus  and also denies that he called on Mr  Smith  to play said Character of  Macbeth  instead of said  Macklin  or for any other Purpose whatsoever and also denies that he hissed hooted or abused those who desired him to be quiet  Saith that on the  Monday  Morning following he waited on Mr  Coleman  the acting Manager of the said Theatre to request of him to use his Influence to obtain an Interview with Mr  Macklin  in order to prevail on Mr  Macklin  to use his utmost Endeavours to find out the several Persons who used Deponent ill the preceding Night that Mr  Coleman  sent his Servant to said  Macklin  to obtain such Interview  which Servant brought back for Answer that said  Macklin  was not at Home that said  Coleman  promised Deponent to speak to  Macklin  and to procure a Meeting with him and that he would give Deponent Notice of such Meeting that in the Evening of same Day he received a Note from Mr  Coleman  informing him that soon after Deponent left said  Coleman  's House said  Macklin  came and refused to have any Meeting or Conversation with Deponent on the Subject in which said Note from  Coleman  to Deponent was inclosed one from  Macklin  to  Coleman  informing said  Coleman  that said  Macklin  refused to meet Deponent  Saith that on or about th of said  November  Deponent did cause to be inserted in the Morning Chronicle a Letter addressed to said  Macklin  in the Words following that is to say  Sir  I call upon you thus publicly to declare your Reasons for refusing to meet me at Mr  Coleman  's or elsewhere as likewise who the Gentlewoman is who first  struck and then set a Russian to assault me on  Saturday  Evening last in the Gallery of  Covent Garden  she being afterwards watched into your House in  James Street Covent Garden  This I must insist upon as I intend then to leave you to the Stings of your own malevolent Heart and the Resentment of the much abused Public  I am Sir Your very humble Servant J S JAMES  Saith that said  Macklin  took no kind of Notice of said Letter either in a public or private manner and saith that receiving no Answer from Mr  Macklin  he went to said Theatre on the th of said  November  with two Gentlemen only who had dined with him that Day at his Lodgings in  Bridge Street  and went into the Pit with an Intent to see the Play of the Merchant of  Venice  in which Play said  Macklin  was to perform the Part of  Shylock  and likewise publicly to repeat the Question to  Macklin  whether he knew the Woman or Man who struck Deponent on  th  November  in the two Shilling Gallery as aforesaid but the Confusion and Noise on  Macklin  's Appearance on the Stage Deponent presumes prevented said  Macklin  from hearing said Question  Positively denies that he roared out to  Macklin  to down on his Knees or that he menaced said  Macklin  with his Stick for he had no Stick or Cane of any kind whatsoever with him during that Evening and saith that on th  November  last he was a perfect Stranger to  Miles Sparks Leigh  any or either of them and never had any Conversation with all or any of them or with  Clarke  or  Aldus  or either of them to drive said  Macklin  off the Stage nor did Deponent enter into any Combination Conspiracy or Agreement with any Persons whomsoever for that Purpose nor did Deponent say or express any Desire t expel said  Macklin  from the Stage for all that Deponent wanted was an Answer to his Question and an Apology for said  Macklin  's Conduct towards the said  Reddish  and  Sparks  Mr  Dunning  The Woman going into the House with the Name of  Macklin  over the Door is no Proof your Lordship sees that she was Mrs  Macklin  on the contrary she is found out to be another Person  Mr  Murphy  It is a Lodginghouse where there are several families  Mr  Buller  My Lord I am of Council likewise on the Part of Mr  James  the only positive Charge is that on the th of  November  last he stood up in the Pit and with Vociferations called to Mr  Macklin  to kneel down and menaced hin with a Stick as to the rest respecting the Charge upon the former Day it only extends to Belief Mr  Macklin  has sworn and upon his Belief refers to another Fact which really is not so as in the Affidvit it appears to be sworn by another Person's Affidavit that  James  insisted tha  Smith  should take Mr  Macklin  's Par  Mr  Macklin  's Affidavit does not say tha  James  was the Man who called upon Mr▪  Smith  to act Mr  Macklin  's Part and then is no other express Charge but that on th  th of  November  against  James  which i  his calling out to Mr  Macklin  to knee  down and the menacing him with a Stick or Cane All the rest of the Affidavit is nothing to Mr  James  the greatest Part of it is only setting out Mr  Macklin  's Merit Mr  James  appears from the first Time to be insulted by People who came there and the Woman who first began the Disturbance was traced to Mr  Macklin  's House he had Notice and was called upon to give an Account if he knew who the Persons were who had used  James  so illBut what was Mr  Macklin  's Conduct he refuses to meet him and gives no Anwer whatsoever which was not an implicit reason that he did not know who they were if he did not know who they were as I think he must know he might have so informed Mr  James  but he had reason to suspect who they were Mr  Macklin  is said to have first appealed to the Public I should have thought his Discretion would have dictated to him to abide by their Opinion let it be what it would but with respect to his present Application to a Court of Justice he is not intitled to the least Favour or Countenance whatsoever for he  brought his Complaint in the most public and solemn Manner he could against two People in the same Profession with himself and which Complaint if proved must have been attended with all the fatal Consequences to those two Gentlemen that  Macklin  seems to apprehend now the Complaint was made by him to the Audience they heard it with Patience the Complaint they found was not true but appeared to be false I don't know any more generous Conduct for any Man to have adopted upon this Occasion where there was a false Charge brought against two Men which as public Men must have been attended with very injurious Consequences to those Gentlemen i  found true than where it was found false to express Horror upon the Occasion It appears that all that Mr  James  desired was to have an Account of those People who had used him ill  James  had shew his own Opinion which he had a righ to maintain and he was justified in Hi  +sing to shew his Disapprobation for whe  this Motion was first made before it was furbished up with this Ground of Conspiracy  which has been since added at that Time the Court said there was no Ground for an Information Now they have foisted in the Ground of Conspiracy which they have not made out It is denied in the most positive Terms respecting the Stick being held up in the Pit it is denied in the most positive Terms that  James  knew any thing of the other Defendants upon the contrary he went as a single Man neither has he entered into any Conspiracy or Combination whatever Mr  Macklin  might have put an end to it if he pleased even after his having made his Appeal to the Public in the Manner he did when he was called upon by Mr  James  he might have answered him by giving him an Account of those Persons from whom he had suffered so much when he was knocked down between the Benches where he was kicked and stamped upon which might have been attended with fatal Consequences to his Person but when called upon Mr  Macklin  refuses to give him any Answer or meet him  Upon the whole it appears there is no kind of Conspiracy in the Conduct of Mr  James  and therefore no Ground for this Information  Lord  Mansfield  Who is in Support of the RuleGo on with them one by one  Mr  Wallace  Will the Court give Judgment one by one  Mr  Dunning  Yes and execute them one by one If your Lordships please to favour me a few Words upon this Case so far as the Rule affects the Person for whom the two Gentlemen have been shewing Cause Your Lordship will recollect what has been stated from the Affidavits containing that Charge which is supported not by Mr  Macklin  only but in the material Parts of it by two or three other People Mr  Macdonnel  and his Wife and Mr  Kavenhuller Skinner  Mr  Bullet  thought good to suppose these People did not swear positively to the Fact or at all to it and that  Macklin  speaks to Belief only of the Facts that passed on the th of  November  last Your Lordship by referring to those Affidavits will correct that Misinformation for nothing can  be more positive to the Facts sworn to by the Affidavits of those people whose Information Mr  Macklin  speaks Of the Facts sworn to upon the th of November last  Macdonnel  and his Wife give this Account that one of  "the Persons who seemed to be at the Head of those who opposed  Macklin's  performing the Character of  Macbeth  and spoke most particularly was one  James  as he called himself whom they believed to be  John Stephen James  of  Bridge Street Westminster  said  James  so publicly declaring"  these Mr  Buller  thought good to represent to your Lordship as Persons speaking from Information and Belief and to suppose Mr  Macklin  spoke from Information and Belief respecting the Person it is charged to be  James  by  Macdonnel  and his Wife but their Affidavit hardly wants Positiveness in the manner of making it three People swear positively Mr  Macklin  making the fourthMr  Macklin  believes  James  to be the Person from whom he received that Treatment and the Reason for his believing it is he has been fo informed by those who now prove it concurring with his own Apprehensions  The Court will now say what is fit to be done upon the Truth of the Case when the Truth is understood Mr  Buller  thought good as did Mr  Bearcroft  who went before him to say Mr  Macklin  who gave certain Provocations which by their Argument they would refer to him in Consequence of which Mr  James  was intitled to act in the manner he did and was not so culpable as the rest he having received very ill Treatment from the Hands of a Woman and some Friends of Mr  Macklin  's If your Lordship looks at the Affidavit of the Gentleman in his own Exculpation and of Mr  Lucas  your Lordship will see upon what Ground these People were warranted in presuming that this Woman was Mrs  Macklin  The Ground is this by the Directions of  James Lucas  followed this Woman to the House upon the Door of which was the Name of  Macklin  Mr  Macklin  lives in that House Part of which belongs to him upon the Door of which leading to his Apartments is his Name the other Part of it is a Shop in the House there are various Lodgers and to what Part of the  Hoause she went they have hot thought proper to tell she might go to a Lodger there or might be a Lodger herself or possibly never heard or knew any thing at all of Mr  Macklin  otherwise than as being a Lodger in the House and disposed to think Mr  Macklin  was ill treated But of this Woman being Mrs  Macklin  there is no Evidence nor do they affect to say she is in any Way so as to induce your Lordship to credit that such is their Belief Your Lordship will give me Leave to say that this Woman so said to be Mrs  Macklin  by Mr  James  was not Mrs  Macklin  and it was so far from being possible for  James  so to believe her that he charged a Woman of the Name of  Macdonnel  with being the Woman who had so treated him he Mr  James  therefore so far from being of that Belief stands under the Predicament of having found out his Mistake if ever there was a Time that he really thought so for this same Mrs  Macdonnel  is the same Person he fixed upon as having given him that Usage and is not Mrs  Macklin  out Mrs  Macdonnel  a Person who has  nothing to do with it but the Fact of being a Witness in this Case all the Argument founded upon it will be removed by shewing there is such a Misrepresentation Then my Lord it remains to shew that the Charge is neither disputed or denied I take Leave to say so notwithstanding the Gentlemen have said it is both disputed and denied these Facts supposing them to be true constitute the Ground of the Charge against this Person  Your Lordship will give me Leave to presume that of which these is undoubted Evidence and which no Person is prepared to controvert  viz  with respect to the enlarging of the Rule for Mr  Leigh  Mr  Buller  was not ill advised it was not a Slip upon the Occasion though the Gentleman says so but he has it from the Attorney giving him Instructions to enlarge it without which he would not have enlarged it therefore it was no Mistake of Instructions but the Gentleman acted agreeable to the Point of his Instructions the Attorney in my Apprehension perfectly understood  what he was about when he gave those Instructions I now understand it and if the Gentleman had not advised he should be defended they would have given him better Instructions Nobody will doubt the Charge when there is a Proof of a great Number of People speaking at a great Number of Times and Places about it and Mr  Leigh  has been seen to give Orders and to apply that Force and collect it which will clearly be found to be the Truth and when not denied it must be taken for granted and if that Time never comes of its being denied it appears in Proof beyond a Doubt there existed in Somebody a determined Purpose to drive this Man from the Stage and though the Gentleman chose to speak of Mr  Macklin  's Apprehensions being groundless Mr  Macklin  at that Time as well as the Time I am now pressing his Interest for the Consideration of the Court if he was in a Situation to apprehend any thing must apprehend he would be discharged and now that he has been discharged if he is not apprehensive of being discharged it is certain he is not  yet restored and not under the Apprehension he shall be restored With respect to their own Safety for which no Imputation falls upon them if the Managers of the Theatre attend to such Behaviour as this it will for ever prevent the Restitution and Restoration of this Man to what the People have driven him from That some People are answerable for that I beg Leave to presume in this Business how far those People are accessary to that Design and instrumental in carrying it into Execution and for the Purpose of obviating the Suspicion of Collusion and Conspiracy the Circumstances are singular enough When I state Mr  Macklin  to be an Irishman he will not be affronted with me what those others are I cannot learn I have not made any Inquiry about it but I find a little  Irish  Blood has found its Way into their Veins or those that advise or appear for them to Day when the Rule was enlarged they appeared by two distinct Classes of Council each representing Three and to Day the Partie  are Six and have six Council and the  they forget there stands my Friend the common Attorney to the whole Six  Mr  Blake  It is not so I am not Attorney for the Six I am Attorney for Mr  Leigh  and Mr  James  's Friend desired me to do Business for him  Mr  Dunning  I don't blame Mr  Blake  for setting me right on the contrary I thank him then it seems there are six Persons appearing by two Attorneys and not one  Mr  Ashe  I am attorney for some of the others  Mr  Dunning  Then I beg Leave to stand again to rectify my Mistake we shall grow accurate by Degrees no doubt then there is one Attorney for three Parties represented by three Council and three Attorneys instructing another Council to be for the three other Parties The corrected Case then is this three Attorneys employ one Council upon the Behalf of three Parties who choose to be understood as Parties entirely unconnected with each other another Attorney employs three distinct Council representing three Parties because they chuse to shew  those three Parties totally unconnected with each other therefore as far as respects the Point of Connection is to be discovered by the  Evidentia rei  of the Case which your Lordship sees with respect to Mr  James  the present Subject in Consideration is that he is understood by his Council to have acquitted himself altogether and they have gone particularly through the Charge in Point of Observation in order to contradict itGive me Leave to go through the Parts of the Answer in the first Place your Lordships are told that this Gentleman went to the Theatre for the peaceable Purpose of seeing the Play perhaps if he had been so very peaceable as my learned Friend he would have had no Occasion to have taken his Wife with him to keep him in Order I wish with all my Heart his Wife could have done so the next Time of his going there but I cannot tell whether it was that this Gentleman grew so unruly that his Wife chose to keep out of his Way it would have been well for the rest of these Defendants if they had done so too or whether it was for other Purposes  It seems he returned to the Playhouse but with what View Not out of Curiosity that being fully satisfied the first Night for then Mr  James  was clearly of Opinion that  Macklin  was incompetent for performing the Character of  Macbeth  the Gentleman might have supposed himself invested with Authority to form a Judgment upon the Merits of Mr  Macklin  as a Performer and in Company with his Wife whose Criticisms concurring with his  Macklin  's Performance of the Character was considered by them as worth Nobody's while to go and see It was odd after he had passed this Judgment that he should chuse whenever Mr  Macklin  came on again in that Character to go and see him This Case is too strong and no Person can give this Gentleman Credit for saying he came on Purpose afterwards to see the Play and when Mr  Macklin  came upon the Stage in different Characters in the Play in  Shylock  and in the Entertainment in Sir  Archy Macsarcasm  I take Leave to suppose the Town agreed that in these Characters Mr  Macklin  always  had capital Merit if there is any Merit in those Characters themselves they are understood by all the World to have been exhibited with all their Advantages by Mr  Macklin  however if it was Mr  James  's Purpose to share in the Pleasures what drew him to see  Macklin  in the Characters of  Shylock  and Sir  Archy Macsarcasm  He was in fear as he thinks fit to tell us before Mr  Macklin  began the Character that they would not let him go on because they wanted Something else they wanted an Apology and some Explanation and God knows what and that which I shall presently go more minutely into the Enquiry ofthat Somethingtherefore it was and not seeing him in Sir  Archy  and  Shylock  clearly which drew Mr  James  to see him in those Characters any more than when he went to see him in  Macbeth  Nobody can suppose nor will Mr  James  wish to be understood that seeing applauding or condemning the Character were among the Object that drew Mr  James  's Attention to the Playhouse It seems however Mr  Jame  having satisfied your Lordships these were  not his Purposes has left us no Doubt what they were for he has had the Goodness to explain them He says the first Time viz the Sixth of  November  there was a Talk about  Reddish  His Affidavit states that  "it appeared to this Depotent that there was no sufficient Proof of either the said  Samuel Reddish  or  James Sparks  hissing neither did this Deponent think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of them the said  Samuel Reddish  and  James Sparks  and this Deponent did therefore disapprove of  Macklin's  Behaviour by the common Mode of Hissing"  What other Purpose if any brought him there that Night Your Lordship sees how soon he forgotfor it seems he hisses the Actor to prevent his going on and why Because there was not sufficient Proof to satisfy this selfcreated selferected Judge He takes upon himself to act upon a Charge he had nothing to do with he had no Connection with either of the Parties but he in pure Generosity as Mr  Buller  tells us was inclined to take upon him to judge of those Merits he supposed himself called upon to try though his Proceedings  in Fact had no Relation at all to the Merits of the PerformanceBut Mr  James  was so inattentive to the Pleasure of the Company there as to think himself authorized to disturb what they might like  Lord  Mansfield  I am very well satisfied as to Mr  James  You need not go any furtherI think what Mr  Buller  alluded to was right if the Application went therefore in the Way he meant it to be sure this Court would not encourage Complaints of the Disapprobation or Approbation of acting upon a public Theatre being shewn in a manner in which every Part of the Auditory has a Right to shew itBut if from Malice Illwill or Resentment a Number of People are ungenerous enough to take Advantage of the Situation a poor Actor is in being at their Mercy upon the Stage to deprive him of his Bread and insult him not upon any Offence arising out of the Play but from Malice and Conspiracy against the Person who is the Actor to strip him of the Means of Living that is a strong Ground of Action which may be brought by himI rather wished he had  I hinted and recommended to him to have brought an ActionBesides the Injury done to him it is most indecent to the Public and a Shame to the Police of the KingdomWith Regard to Mr  James  he don't deny some of the principal Parts of the Charge and upon his own Affidavit he gives sufficient Ground to shew with what View after the Sixth of  November  he went there and with what Principle and for what PurposesAs to the Affidavit of  Macdonnel  and his Wife he hardly gives an Answer to any Part of itIt is the clearest fullest and most express Charge and he hardly gives an Answer to any Part of that AffidavitIt is very remarkable in that Affidavit which  e don't deny Mrs  Macdonnel  swears throughout he took her for Mrs  Macklin  and challenged her with being Mrs  Macklin  and all along considered her as Mrs  Macklin  He was so outrageous so vio  ent and so mad that he challenged Men  nd WomenThese are strong Words of his Affidavit which are not answered  y him  But taking it upon his own Affidavit which is the fairest WayHe goes there upon the Sixth of  November  whether he went for Amusement or other Purposes he don't say but he goes on the Sixth of  November  he says before the Beginning of the Play Mr  Macklin  came upon the Stage with a Parcel of Papers in his Hands which he began to read the Purport of which was to prove Mr  Reddish  a Performer of  Drury Lane  the first Night of his performing the Part of  Macbeth  had hissed and upon hearing the same read it appeared to him there was no sufficient Proof of either said  Reddish  or  Sparks  hissing neither did he this Deponent think a mere Relation sufficient to contradict the Oaths of them the said  Reddish  and  Sparks  which they had respectively made whereby they denied it and he says he therefore shewed his Disapprobation of  Macklin  's Behaviour by the common Method of Hissing and he says he hissed that EveningThere it rests for that NightBut how comes it upon the Thirteenth of  November  that he came there With what View and in what  Company does he come there Manifestly for Vengeance not to see the PlayHe says he went it being the fourth Time of Mr  Macklin  's performing the CharacterHe says that as  Macklin  had not produced any positive Proof of  Reddish  and  Sparks  Hissing as he had pledged himself to the Public to do he this Deponent as well as others called for such Proof or Concesson and upon that a Squabble happened with a Woman  Macdonnel  's Wife whom he swore to be most outrageousAs to Proofs and Concessions  Macklin  had nothing to do with it  Macklin  was wrong in saying any Thing about it and much more so after they had made their Affidavits to take Notice of it  But he goes on Purpose not to see the Play but to call for Proofs and ConcessionsWho was to take them Was the Court Or the Pit Or the Upper Gallery They had not defined what the Concessions were to be or to whom to be madeThen  James  is outrageous and makes all this Work for want of Proofs end Concessions that he had no Business to  go to the Playhouse to ask forThen he has made a Slip in one Thing which I am sure he was not aware ofIt is insisted there was no ConspiracyTo be sure no ConspiracyThe other Persons joined in the Rule have no Acquaintance with himBut when he comes to give an Account he says if his  Friends  that went with him had not done so and so they should not have been able to have got the better therefore it appears he went with a Body of his Friends to demand Proofs and Concessions by Vociferations and Noise in the HouseAfter this he wants to speak with  Macklin  I suppose  Macklin  took Care not to meet himHe was afraid to speak to him as he was so boisterous but to Mr  Coleman  he desires to be excused giving him any Satisfaction about this Woman at allIn Consequence of this Mr  James  sends a Challenge and publishes it in the NewspapersHe writes to him in this Manner  Sir I call upon you thus publicly to declare your Reasons for refusing to meet me at Mr  Coleman  's or elsewhere as likewise who the Gentlewoman is  who first struck and  then  set a Russian to assault me on  Saturday  Evening last in the Gallery of  Covent Garden  Theatre she being afterwards watched into your House in  James Street Covent Garden  This I must insist upon as I intend then to leave you to the Stings of your own malevolent Heart and the Resentment of the much injured Public  Then for fear the Court should not be able to perceive it was a Challenge  James  takes Care of this for he declares in his Affidavit that Mr  Macklin  did not dare to answer him  either in a public or private Manner  However this is not a Conspiracy He says he is not acquainted with the particular Persons that might be thereThere might be Scores or Hundreds concerned in itMr  Macklin  singled out as well as he could those he was able to give Evidence of  James  says he did not enter into a Conspiracy to drive  Macklin  for ever from the StageBut still he should give Proofs or Concessions before he acted again  Now as to a Conspiracy it is not necessary to prove a parole or written Agreement  in order to make a Conspiracy if persons concur in Acts to do the same Thing that is Evidence to be left to a Jury whether it is or is not a Conspiracy You all remember the Case of the GhostSeveral Persons were there convicted of a Conspiracy I believed what they themselves said when they moved the Court for a new Trial that they had not a parole Communication much less a written Agreement but they all concurred in the same Imposition upon the Public by setting up this Ghost I said upon the Trial if the Jury thought they all concurred towards the same End and upon any bad or improper Principles took Par  in setting up that Ghost that it was no  necessary to prove either a parole or written Agreement to do it and upon th  Motion for a new Trial the Court was o  that OpinionBut what is this Case  James  denies he entered into a Conspirac  to drive  Macklin  from the StageBut wha  did he want All he wanted was a  Answer to his Question and an Apolog  for  Macklin  's Conduct towards  Samu  Reddish  and  James Sparks  What had  o with  Samuel Reddish  or  James Sparks  Who made him the Champion of  Reddish  and  Sparks  Yet he is desirous it should appear that he was not acquainted with them or they with him but still he goes to get this Apology or Answer and will not suffer the Play to go on but insults the Audience Acting in this manner was very malevolent to Mr  Macklin  With respect to  James  therefore let the Rule be made absolute Go on with the next  Mr  Norton  I am for Mr  Miles  and shall trouble your Lordship with such Answers to the Charge against him as occur to me  I apprehend there is very little Proof against Mr  Miles  He is charged with being present in  Covent Garden  House upon the Eighteenth of  November  that he hissed was noisy and outrageous with a great Number of other Persons in the PitHe is likewise charged with having wrote something upon Paper and throwing it out of the Pit upon the StageWhat the Contents of the Paper were is not stated so I presume your Lordships will not consider it to be so statedThen  that he had a Conference with Mr  Woodward  and after that  Woodward  retired I think that is the whole of the Charge made upon Mr  Miles  He is not charged with being present in the Evening Mr  Macklin  acted  Macbeth  I understand there was a strange Disturbance upon the Eighteenth of  November  but he is not charged with any Conspiracy except what could be inferred from expressing his Disapprobation at the Time of Acting by HissingNo Suspicion can properly fall upon  Miles  On his Part I have an Affidavit by which he declares he went to the House upon the Eighteenth of  November  for the Purpose of seeing Mr  Macklin  act the Part of  Shylock  and the Part of Sir  Archy Macsarcasm  in an Entertainment in which Parts I understand he has always acquitted himself with great ApplauseHe says the Audience was very noisy at the Time of drawing up the Curtain and he not approving altogether of Mr  Macklin  's Conduct joined in some Degree with the Noise of the House so far he admits but says he did it merely because he thought Mr  Macklin  ought  after what he said to make some little Concession to the PublicThat he did not do it with any View or Intention of driving him from his ProfessionIn short that he was in no Combination and had no Malice against  Macklin  Thus it stands upon Mr  Miles  's Affidavit I apprehend therefore with Deference to your Lordships from the whole of the Case it appears there was no Malice or Intention of MaliceThat  Miles  went there as a SpectatorThat what be did was no more than expressing his Disapprobation of  Macklin  as every Person in a Playhouse generally does if they dislike a PerformanceThat he considered himself as having a Right to do it and if any Consequence arose from it by that Behaviour Mr  Macklin  may have his Remedy by ActionBut I trust in such a Case as this your Lordships will never let an Information go against him  Lord  Mansfield  Is the Letter set out in the Affidavit  Mr  Norton  No my Lord we say nothing at all about it  Mr MILES's Affidavit read  The Affidavit of WILLIAM AUGUSTUS MILES Gentleman sworn the th of  May    SAITH That he want into the pit of the Theatre Royal  Covent Garden  on the Eighteenth of  November  last to see the Play of the  Merchant  of  Venice  and the Farce of  Love a la Mode  advertised for that Night and that on drawing up the Curtain the Audience became very clamorous for the Appearance of the acting Manager and incessantly called out for Mr  Coleman  to come on the Stage saith that  Macklin  habited in the Character of  Shylock  came on the Stage in Opposition to the general Sense of the Audience and on being desired to go off he peremptorily refused and in the most insolent Manner advanced to the Orchestra and stampt with his Feet and continued on the Stage  Saith Deponent then understood be Resentment of the Audience against  said  Macklin  was occa  ioned by his bringing Charges against some Persons with whom Deponent is and ever was unacquainted and which Deponent understood and thought appeared to be false and groundless and for engaging some Persons to interrupt the Sense of the independant Part of the Audience on the Night of the Thirteenth of  November  Saith That he was then informed that several Persons were by hired People most cruelly beat and otherwise ill treated for giving their Opinion on the Merits of said  Macklin  in the Character of  Macbeth  and finding by much the major Part if not the Whole of the Audience on the Night of the Eighteenth of  November  last incensed at the Outrage offered by said  Macklin  to the Public and insisting on some Concession being made Deponent did as an Individual give his Sentiments to the same Purport and without being connected or in the least acquainted either directly or indirectly with any of the abused Parties but merely from  a Conviction that some Apology wa  due from  Macklin  to the Audience fo  the Insult they had received and th  groundless Charge he had made on particular Persons  Saith That he did not by any Words or Signs give any Signals to th  Audience whatsoever nor did he threaten or menace any of the Actors an  on his Oath saith he was a perfe  Stranger to  Leigh Sparks James Aldu  and  Clarke  on the Eighteenth of  November  last and that he neither hired no  engaged nor was concerned in hirin  or engaging directly or indirectly and Person nor Persons to hiss the said  Macklin  nor was Deponent concerned or engaged in any Combination Conspiracy or Agreement with any Persons whomsoever to hiss or otherwi  molest or interrupt the said  Macklin  i  his Performance on the Stage  Lord  Mansfield  Miles  does not deny the Charges he does not deny his being accessary to driving  Macklin  from his Bread  Mr  Murphy  It was by  Mile  's written Order that  Macklin  was discharged  Lord  Mansfield  Upon the Eighteenth of  November Miles  was at the House he took Part in the Quarrel they all went on Purpose therefore let the Rule be absolute as to him  Mr  Mansfield  I am for Mr  Clarke  so far as respects him from the State of  Macklin  's Affidavit the Charge is that upon the Eighteenth of  November  the Affidavit not pretending  Clarke  to be at  Covent Garden  Theatre upon any former Occasions that he sat in a Box one Story high over the Stage that when he made his Appearance he was saluted with the waving of Sticks and a NoiseThen it is charged that  Clarke  made a Signal to the Audience next that there was a His  ing and crying off offThat he gave several Signals which from their constantly producing the same Effect Deponent  Macklin  apprehends were preconcerted Signals which  Clarke  sometimes made with his Hat and sometimes with  Piece of Wood he had in his Hand co  ered with red Cloth with which he menaced  Macklin  and called upon him to kneel down and ask Pardon Now in that Mr  Macklin  is unconfirmed and it is denied by  Clarke  Next it is charged that he cried off off and that he beat the Scenes most furiously with the Board that he threw a Note upon the Stage and ordered the Actors to go off that he roared out  Coleman Coleman  and desired him to come upon the Stage that  Clarke  appeared to be one of those Persons to whom this Riot and Behaviour was imputable This is the whole of the Charge against  Clarke Macklin  lumps him with the several other Persons  Leigh Miles  and the others and says he understands it was a Combination by all these Persons for discharging him from the Stage whence he was afterwards discharged Mr  Clarke  is a Gentleman of  Surry  lives at  Moulsey  and is a Man of Fortune He gives this Answer that he never was at the Theatre either of the four Times when  Macklin  acted  Macbeth  It might be owing to his Misfortune his not seeing the Character of  Macbeth  shine in Mr  Macklin  an  no doubt it did if he had had the Pleasure  of seeing him act in that Character I dare say it would have so recommended Mr  Macklin  to him that he would not have been induced to do as he did He went to see Mr  Macklin  in the two Characters of  Shylock  and Sir  Archy Macsarcasm  he denies he is at all conscious of making any Salutations to the Audience or that the Audience made any Return to them he tells your Lordships It is true that he took up a Piece of Board with a red Cloth which was in the Box and that he made as much Noise as any Body in the House that he struck it against the Scenes and against the Side of the Wainscot of the Box that soon after the Curtain was drawn up there was a prodigious Cry of off off that soon after Mr  Macklin  came upon the Stage in the Dress of  Shylock  that there was then some Talk or Dispute between  Macklin  and some Gentlemen in the Pit that  Macklin  retired and came in his own proper Dress that there was then a great Cry of off off that  Macklin  was called out to by a great Number of the Audience to make good the Charge against  Reddish  and  Sparks  for some  Offence against the People and  Clarke  tells your Lordship that finding a Majority of the Audience in this he did concur in saying off off and hissing and striking the Board against the Scenes and Box finding a Majority of the Audience calling to  Macklin  to submit and beg Pardon he joined with the rest That he then sent a Note to Mr  Coleman  as Mr  Macklin  states he threw the Note upon the Stage which was a Note to  Coleman  to beg he would come upon the Stage to make Peace to desire  Macklin  to quiet the Audience which he was told he might if he would beg their Pardon he says Mr  Coleman  did not come upon the Stage and then Mr  Clarke  tells your Lordships he went away and left the House One of the Affidavits states that he was upon the Stage afterwards and Mr  Coleman  came there but he denies that and says he went to  Drury Lane  directly  As to preconcerting of Signals he does in express Terms swear he never preconcerted Signals with any Person whomeverThat those Gentlemen who were taking an active Part and Lead in the Business  stood in the Pitone was represented as holding up a Paper Mr  Sparks  I believe and one was threatening with a Stick they were taking different Partshe says that he had no more to do with it than there being a Noise of crying off he did the same and struck the Place with the Boardthat he not only had no kind of Preconcert with them at all but was a total Stranger to them and never spoke to any one of them in his Life nor to Mr  Macklin  upon any other Subject the last Thing he did before his going to  Drury Lane  Theatre was he met  Miles  as he was going out who said something to him but he does not know what he saidhe denies having had any Connection with any Person whomsoeverhe admits he certainly bore a Part he hissed and knocked the Board he had in his Hand which he had taken out of the Balcony against the Box in which he washe says that he had no malevolent Design against  Macklin  that he wished  Macklin  would come and beg Pardon with which the People would be perfectly satisfiedIf the Business of this Court is to consider whether  a Man hath acted with perfect Decency upon these Occasions I could not acquit Mr  Clarke  most certainly but Mr  Calrke  never conceived any Degree of Malice against Mr  Macklin  at any Time he had no Altercation with  Macklin  he had no other Connection or Concern in the Affrays than what he has submitted in his Affidavit which when your Lordships have heard read you will find no Ground to involve Mr  Clarke  in this Information if there is any it must be upon the Ground of Conspiracy on the Part of Mr  Clarke  to do  Macklin  an Injury  Mr CLARKE's Affidavit read  The Affidavit of JOSEPH CLARKE  Esq  sworn the th of  May    SAITH on  November  he went to the Theatre Royal  Covent Garden  to see the Play of the Merchant of  Venice  and the Entertainment of  Love a la Mode  and got to said Theatre before the Curtain was drawn up and sat in the Box one Story high over the Stage  Denies that to his Knowledge or Behalf that on making his Appearance in said Box he was saluted with three Chears with waving of Hats brandishing of Sticks or that he received any Salutation whatsoever with Acknowledgment and Satisfaction or returned any Salutation made to him  Denies that as the Curtain was drawing up he made any Signal with his Hat to the Audience or any Thing else to make an Outrage of Hissing or Hooting or to cry off off off  Saith that as soon as the Curtain drew up and two of the Performers of the Play came on the Stage a great many of the Audience in the Pit cried off off off and the Players withdrew from off the Stage and thereupon Mr  Charles Macklin  in the Dress of  Shylock  came on the Stage when some Altercation or Dispute arose between the said  Macklin  and some Persons in the Pit when said  Macklin  went off the Stage and took off the Dress of  Shylock  and came on the Stage again in his common Dress when he was called  upon by the Majority of the Audience as Deponent believes to make good his Charge against  Reddish  and  Sparks  and to clear up some other Matters which he was accused with but  Macklin  as Deponent verily believes desired further Time to make good his Charge against  Reddish  and  Sparks  and to clear up such other Matters with which he was accused that thereupon  Macklin  was called upon by the Majority of the Audience as Deponent believes to make his Submission to the whole Audience by asking Pardon which said  Macklin  refused to do and said  Macklin  not making good his Charge against  Reddish  and  Sparks  and not clearing up the Matters with which he was accused and not making a Submission to the Audience as was required Deponent did as did the Majority of the Audience as Deponent believes Hiss and cry Off off off  Admits he had a Board or false Rail in his Hand covered with red which was loose on the Top of the Box where he leant over which Deponent  believes takes off and puts on occasionally and admits he made a Noise with said Board by striking it against the Box and Scenes but denies to his Knowledge or Belief he menaced or threatened said  Macklin  with the same  Saith that said  Macklin  continued obstinate in not making a Submission and the Audience beginning to be more violent than ever Deponent wrote a Note to Mr  Coleman  the Manager of said House to desire he would come on the Stage which Deponent thought would be the only Way to put an End to the Disturbance but said  Macklin  refused to come and Deponent thereupon went to said  Coleman  in the Green Room and desired he would appear on the Stage and inform the Audience that whilst said  Macklin  lay under their Displeasure that he should not appear again on the Stage until he had made a proper Submission to the Public or used Words to that Effect and the reason of Deponent's so doing was because he apprehended it was most likely to put an End to the Disturbance  Saith said  Coleman  still refusing to come on the Stage Deponent immediately left said Theatre and went to the Theatre Royal in  Drury Lane  Saith he hath been informed and believes that said  Coleman  did afterwards that Evening come on said Stage and address himself to the Audience and saith he never preconcerted any Signals with  William Augustus Miles John Stephen James Ralph Aldus Thomas Leigh  and  James Sparks  or any of them to be given by him said  Joseph Clarke  on said th of  November  at Theatre Royal  Covent Garden  But on the contrary Deponent saith he was before th of said  November  and whilst the Disturbance was making in said House that Evening a total Stranger to said  Miles James Aldus Leigh  and  Sparks  and never had any Conversation with them or any or either of them touching said  Macklin  or any Thing else except that Deponent met said  Miles  by Accident that Night as he was going behind the Scenes to the Green Room to Mr  Coleman  as  aforesaid who spoke to Deponent but what he said Deponent can't recollect  Saith he never preconcerted any Signals to be given by him said th of  November  at the Theatre Royal  Covent Garden  with any Person or Persons whatsoever and denies to his Knowledge or Belief he menaced said  Macklin  with said Board covered with red as aforesaid and denies he made any Signals with it to make a Disturbance in said Theatre said th of  November  but admits he had said Board in his Hand and struck it against the Box and Scenes and made a Noise with it  Denies he called upon said  Macklin  to kneel down and ask Pardon but admits he cried off off off which seemed to Deponent to be the general Sense of the Audience then present and denies he did in Conjunction with  Miles James Aldus Leigh  and  Sparks  or any of them or with any other Person compel the Managers of said Theatre to discharge said  Macklin  from his Employ Deponent having no such Wish  Desire or Intention but verily believes that if said  Macklin  had made a proper Submission to the Audience the same would have been accepted by the Majority thereof which would have put an End to the Disturbance  Denies that he ever entered into any Combination Conspiracy or Agreement with said  Miles James Aldus Leigh  and  Sparks  or any of them or any other Person against said  Macklin  in order to discharge him from the Theatre on said th of  November  or any other Time  Saith he had not any ill Will against said  Macklin  but was desirous as he believes was the Majority of the Audience then present that said  Macklin  should have made a proper Submission to the Public as well on Account o  said  Samuel Reddish  and  James Sparks  as on Account of other Matters which he was accused with  Saith he was not at the said Theatre the d or th of  October  last nor the th or th of said  November  when said  Macklin  appeared in the Character  of  Macbeth  and denies he was in said PlayHouse on the th of said  November  when Mr  Coleman  came on the Stage Deponent having before that Time left the said House  Lord  Mansfield  There is enough in  Clarke  's Admission to be sure he joins with them most outrageously because  Macklin  did not make out the Charge against  Reddish  and  Sparks  therefore the Rule must be absolute as to him  Mr  Dunning  It would be a Pity if the Standard Bearer did not make one with the Troop when he held the Trophy  lifted up the Flag which was the Flag of Death  Mr  Wallace  After hearing the Rules  our Lordship hath laid down tho' I conceive upon Mr  Macklin  's appealing to the Public he had submitted to their Sen  ence I shall not trouble the Court on  he Part of Mr  Aldus  he went there up  n this Dispute about  Reddish  and  Sparks  doubt as well as many more and af  Macklin  's Appeal to the Public they  ought to make him appear in that more  ridiculous than in any Character he attempted to play  Lord  Mansfield  They certainly did so If they had only whipt him a little and mortified him it would not have been so much but when it is carried so far as to advise the Managers to discharge him and take his Bread from him it is then carried too far and I would advise them now the Rules are gone instead of the vast Expence it will be in going on to make a reasonable Satisfaction and Composition and to let Part of the Money that would go amongst you Gentlemen be applied towards that Satisfaction  Mr Serjeant  Davy  I am for  Sparks  Mr  Davenport  Sparks  is the Man that went to the Antelope Alehouse with  Leigh  to get a Party together  Lord  Mansfield  to Mr Serjeant  Davy  Are you for  Sparks  and  Leigh  Mr Serjeant  Davy  I am for  Sparks  Lord  Mansfield  With regard to  Sparks  supposing him I have not the Particulars in my Mind but supposing him to be charged as the greatest Aggressor I think there should be no Rule against him  Macklin  was extremely wrong to call in Question in that public Way the Veracity of  Sparks  therefore I think the Rule should not go as to him  Mr  Dunning  Your Lordship will give me Leave to mention what the Charge is It goes precisely to this Point  Sparks  in Concurrence with  Leigh  hires People to drive  Macklin  away  Lord  Mansfield  Supposing it ever so strong Mr  Macklin  was in the wrong with regard to  Reddish  and  Sparks  in appealing to the Public and a Man who is in the wrong should not come for the Interposition of this Court against another Person who is in the wrong  Mr  Murphy  I will tell your Lordship how that Matter stands and then your Lordship will judge how far Mr  Macklin  was wrong in regard to  Sparks  The Fact is that Mr  Macklin  was attacked the first Night and upon his first Appearance in  Macbeth  He had not been used to that Sort of Behaviour during forty Years and was very much astonished what could occasion itThree Persons informed him one of whom hath now made an Affidavit  that  Sparks  and  Reddish  were the People who occasioned the Tumult in the Gallery the first NightThen upon the subsequent  Saturday  it was Upon a  Saturday  he first applied Mr  Macklin  finding all the Newspapers Day after Day Morning and Evening pouring out the most virulent Abuse upon him calling him Murderer Villain and the most opprobrious Names of every sort and Paragraphs desiring the Public to drive him from the Stage if he ever appeared again he went upon the Stage with a large Bundle of Papers the Papers of a Week as I am informed I was not therebut I think it is so upon the Affidavits he said he had been long in their Service and there was his Reward pointing to the Bundle of Papers of the whole Week which he held in his Hands full of every Scurrility that could be inserted in News Papers poured out upon him and Paragraph's desiring the Public to drive him from the Stage and submitted to their Judgment whether they would permit him to play the Characters that Nightthat he had been informed  Sparks  and  Reddish  were the Persons who begun the Riot Mr  Macklin  agreed with me that News Paper Paragraphs were odious and it appeared to me not to be a desirable Way for Mr  Macklin  to refute even  Reddish  upon his Oathhe readily concurred with me and as he could not get People to prove it upon Oath he was to procure the Papers and read the Proof on  Saturday  Lord  Mansfield  How dared Mr  Macklin  attempt to prove a Perjury upon  Reddish  he charged  Sparks  and  Reddish  in the News Papers with having hissed him  Mr  Dunning  I fancy your Lordship mistakes the Fact at present in Favour of Mr  Sparks  for the Point about which these Parties disputed was the Unsatisfactoriness of the Proof insisted upon and the Fact to be decided by this singular Tribunal was whether Mr  Reddish  had hissed  Sparks  adopts the Charge as far as respected him but says he though I did hiss which I have a right to do yet  Reddish  being an Actor it is Matter of Imputation upon him and I as his Champion will make good the Charge the  Point to be tried was whether they were truly or falsely charged  Lord  Mansfield  That don't vary it he charges  Sparks  with hissing and brings the Proof upon the Stagecharging both him and  Reddish  and appeals in that way that was wrong he should have applied to the Laws of the Country and if he would not he shall not come here for an extraordinary InterpositionI go upon the Ground of  Sparks  's being more guilty than any against whom the Rules are gonethat may be taken to the Grand Jurybut with regard to  Leigh  the Rule must be made absolute as it was enlarged for him and the Rule must be discharged as to  Sparks
