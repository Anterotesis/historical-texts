 A Brief Survey OF THE  Legal Liberties  OF THE  DISSENTERS  AND How far the BILL now Depending consists with Preserving the  Toleration  INVIOLABLY WHEREIN The present Bill is Published and also the TOLERATION ACT at large that they may be compar'd with One Another  EDINBƲRGH  Reprinted in the YEAR  A Brief Survey OF THE  Legal Liberties  OF THE  Dissenters  c  _IT is no Time now to make Flourishes and lay down Aphorisms to debate upon Matters of Fact must speak themselves and that they may do so let us bringthem together  The  Toleration  was granted to the  Dissenters  at the Beginning of the Revolution he that told us  It was not a Courtesy but a Capitulation the Performance of an Agreement  not  an Act of meer Tenderness and Charity  said True or he said False for my Part I never heard him Confuted or much said to contradict it  If the  Toleration  of  Dissenters  was a Grant of meer Charity and Mercy yet it was no other Charity and Mercy than the  Church of England  as Christians were obliged to shew Persecution for Conscience being contrary to the Principles of the  Christian Religion  and if they were oblig'd to grant it they are equally oblig'd to continue it unless they can alledge the  Dissenters  have done any Thing to forfeit it which we challenge all the  Tories  in  England  to prove  If the  Toleration  of  Dissenters  was a Capitulation all Capitulations ought to be perform'd all Agreements ought to be executed and it is as much their Right to demand the Preserving of it as it was to demand the Enacting it  But the Queen besides all this has promis'd to continue it and to preserve it  Inviolably  we doubt not Her Majesty meant to do so when She said it and means so still But what mean they who would oblige Her or perswade Her to break Her Word  We do not say the Parliament offer this and we doubt not but some People flatter themselves that all these Things are not only Consistent with but will be Effectual for the  Inviolable  Preservation of the  Toleration  we shall see presently how it will be prov'd  The Managers of Persecuting Principles have very pretty Ways with them to cover and guild over the most effectual Measures of Destroying us with fair Pretences of Preserving us Perhaps this Taking away the Schools and Academies of the  Dissenters  is done the better to preserve  c  Inviolably  We find in the first Section of the last  Occasional Bill  the Enacting Clauses thus Introduced  "Now for the better Securing the said Church  so far is Good  and Quieting the Minds of Her Majesty's  Protestant  and  Dissenting  Subjects and Rendering them Secure in the Exercise of their Religious Worship  c  Be it Enacted  I do not say That the Bill following those Words did abridge the said  Dissenters  of any of their Liberties in the Exercise of their Religious Worship But this I will say That if the  Dissenters  were so abridg'd by that Act then joining the Words together it will follow  That their said Liberties were so abridg'd the better to Quiet their Minds and for the Securing them in the Exercise of their Religious Worship  perhaps other Laws may be Bless'd with the like Congruity  Before we go on to Examine what may or not be deem'd an Attempt upon and Inconsistent with the  Religious Liberties  of the  Dissenters  it may be very useful for us to enquire what those  Liberties  really are to which Purpose and that the  Dissenters  may know how far those  Liberties  do or do not extend and when they are or are not Invaded I believe it very much to the present Purpose to publish the said  Toleration Act  at large which altho' it be put at the End of this Tract the Reader is desir'd to turn to it and Peruse it before he goes on any farther  HAVING now Suppos'd that the Readers of this Tract have Perus'd the Act of  Toleration  deliberately and have thereby a clear Account of what the  Dissenters  Liberties really are it will be also Necessary to let them see what it is that the present Depending Bill is to Enact against them and so we shall presently judge about the Word  INVIOLABLY  c  It is true and this is the great Pretence of those who promote this Matter That the keeping of Schools and Academies for the Instructing and Educating our Children is not expresly a Part of the  Toleration Bill  And therefore say they The  Toleration  may be Inviolably  preserv'd notwithstanding the Passing the present Bill  But the  Dissenters  will refute this by alledging That the Liberty of Teaching and Instructing our Children is such an Essential in the  Meaning  of a  Toleration  that it needs no more to be express'd therein than a Liberty of going out of our own Houses or rising out of our Beds and putting on our Clothes in Order to a religious Assembly need to be express'd in that Part of the Act which allows Places to be appointed for that Worship  If any essential Part of the  Toleration  be taken away altho' not express'd how is the  Toleration  then preserv'd  Inviolably  Farther the educating of Children is a Part of the religious Duties of a Christian and among these of the  Protestant Religion  more especially regarded as such If the  Dissenters  are abridg'd of what is their indispensible Duty they are persecuted in the most extreme Sense of Persecution For the Consequence is they must offend against this Law because they are  bound  to obey GOD rather than Man  In offending this Law they must incur a Penalty not being able to pay the Penalty they must go to Prison and in Prison they must perish So that in Consequence of this Law the  Dissenters  will suffer  Death  for their Religion and and yet the  Toleration  be preserved INVIOLABLE  I think the Plainness of this Case is not to be found Fault with Religion is nothing more or less than a Serving or Worshipping GOD our Maker and Lawgiver The Method is prescrib'd by His  Word Conscience  is to every Man the Judge of his own Duty and the Manner of Performing is this Conscience is a Sovereign Dictator in the Mind of Men and it must be obey'd So it is not meet to make Laws to restrain it human Power having no judicial Right over it  As then Conscience must be obey'd in which the Scripture is clear  Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man judge ye  When Laws are made restraining us to such Things as Conscience forbids to do or commands not to omit what must we do  The Answer is plain  We must suffer  True but then we must say  That this is  PERSECUTION If then  Persecution  is contrary to the  Principles  of the  Christian Religion  as we have the Authority of Parliament in the Preamble to the  first occasional Bill  to prove what follows But that every  persecuting Act  is an  Unchristian Act  Whether the present depending Bill be a Persecuting and consequently an unchristian still let others judge this Deponent faith not  It may however be of some Use to enquire into some of the Consequences which the  Dissenters  may expect from this Law that those who are to suffer by it may prepare their Minds for  Martyrdom  and they who are to pass it may consider what  Ruin  of  Families  what  Blood  of  Conscientious Sufferers  what  Encrease  of  Ignorance  and consequently of  Error  they are going to be the Cause of and what terrible Havock they are going to make in the  Reformation  which has Enemies enough and Wounds enough already Perhaps when these Things come to be seriously reflected upon they may consider  Since then the  Persecution  is thus reviv'd what must the  Dissenters  do  Negatively  I'll tell you what they  cannot do  They cannot say their  Toleration  is INVIOLABLY preserv'd They that think this Bill does not interfere with the  Toleration  may here compare them together The one says  Ease is to be given to tender Consciences  The other says  The tenderest Consciences shall be opprest  one says  The  Dissenters  shall have Liberty to assemble and their Children may worship GOD with them  The other says  They shall not have Schoolmasters to instruct them how to Worship  one gives them a Liberty of  professing their Dissent  The other denies them the Liberty of  being Taught to know why they dissent  This is the ready Way indeed to make  Dissenting  be a  Faction  in the next Age as they pretend it is now  not a religious Principle  Thus the  Toleration  is  preserv'd  and not  preserv'd  at the same Time The  Letter  of the  Toleration  is preserv'd  in Deed but the  Substance  and  essential Parts  are destroy'd  They cannot say they are kindly treated by the Church and when they look back upon their own Conduct to the Church they tell them plainly  they have not deserv'd this Usage at their Hands  When they rescued the Church from an evident Ruin in King  James  's Time mighty Promises of Temper and Tenderness were made them let us suppose now the  Dissenters  parting with them at that Time in this Manner  "  Yes yes  Gentlemen you promise us fair now while you are under Apprehensions of the  Popish Party  Now you call us  Brethren  and talk well of the  small  Differences between us and how Charity ought to bury what is past and to bind us closser for the Time to come that you find now you have been mistaken and that we are as  faithful  to the  Protestant Interest  as your selves and you will for ever esteem us the  same Christians  as your Selves allowing us a  Legal  establish'd Liberty and living in  Love  and  Charity  with us will never more suffer the  indifferent Things  which are in Dispute among us to divide us But when by our Assistance you are establish'd again you will forget all these Things When a Generation rises up  That knows not  Joseph they will call us all  Schismaticks  and  Recusants  again Couple us with  Papists  say we are  Dangerous  to the  Church  and  Enemies  to  Monarchy  and make new Laws against us destroy the  Toleration  you now offer us and  persecute  us as bad as ever  When the  Dissenter  says thus to them Suppose a certain Grave Divine stands up and Quotes the Words of  Hasael  the King of  Assyria Is thy Servant a Dog that be should do this thing  What now would that Grave Divine say  for the Passage is not a Fable  if he were to see this Bill passing the House would he Plead that  this is not Persecution  The Question is not only upon the word  Persecution  tho' that is answer'd plain enough too But is it  Just  Is it  Kind  Is it  Grateful  Is it  Agreeable  to former Pretences Is it what was  Solemnly Promised  when the  Church  stood in need of the Assistance and Support of the  Dissenters  in the time of their Extremity Is this the Performance of Solemn Engagement to the  Dissenters  Is this the  Temper  you promis'd to come to Is this the  Love  and  Charity  you resolv'd to live in Monstrous Perfidious  They cannot say they are not  Persecuted  Persecution is the  Constraining  and  Restraining Conscience  by Force and Punishment To  Restrain from  what we dare not  Omit  is as much Persecution as to  Constrain  to what we dare not  Comply with  Can any  Christian  Omit Instructing his Children in the  Christian Religion Dare  any  Dissenter  Educate his Child in that Way which he dares not Conform to himself Is not that Condemning himself and Abandoning his Child Does he not by that single Act either declare that he  Dissents  without any Foundation or that he Values not the  Salvation  of his Child  Conscientious  Dissenters  have never yet shewn  such an Indifferency in the Matter of Conformity if they had they could not have been suppos'd to Suffer such  Hardships  as they now do to be expelled any Share either in the  Trust Honour  or  Profits  of their Country's Service  They cannot say that they are at all oblig'd by this to farther and future Services and altho' it is true that the  Dissenters  may not withdraw their Hands from the Necessary Services of their Country as  English Men  yet all those Voluntary Services which upon all Occasions they have appear'd Freely and Generously to join in they must now Restrain in Order to carry on the more needful Expence of Educating and Instructing their Children Abroad and keeping Tutors for them in their own Houses and in Assisting Poor Families to do the same  There are  Affirmative  Consequences of their  Persecution  which it is not so proper to Mention only I take the Freedom to tell these Warm People that there will not one  Dissenter  's Child the more be brought up in the  Church  of  England  by this  Persecuting Act  neither will this Lessen but Encrease the  Schism  and the Number of  Dissenters  in  England  It is true it will straiten the  Dissenters  in their Educating their Children put them to Difficulties and Expence As to the first they must Suffer it as an Effect of  Persecution  And as to the last the Money wh  ch the  Dissenters  now freely▪ Contribute to the  Church  over and above what the Law demands  viz  on Subscription to  Charities  to  Lecturers  to  Poor Clergy  to  Briefs  c Which it would be the greatest Madness in the  Dissenters  not to Restrain These I say will Pay all the Difference in the Expence of the Education of their Children and assist them to Educate the Poor that cannot do it themselves  Again seeing the  Clergy  of the  Church  are so Sensible of the Effect of our Schoolmasters Teaching the  Dissenters  Children the  Assemblies  Catechism that they should make a Law that they shall not be Instructed in that manner at School it is a Warm Admonition to the  Dissenters  to Revive the Ancient Family Discipline and Instruction which was the Original Method by which the Reformation was begun in this Nation and by duly Catechising their own Children and Servants and giving Catechises to the Poor Families that want them effectually supply the Deffect and thus the End of these  Church Christians  viz to lessen  Christian Knowledge  instead of encreasing it shall be Defeated till they think fit to make another Bill to take the  Disscurers  Children away from them as the  Papists  did to the  Protestants  in  France  or as the  Mahometans  do now to the  Armenian  Christians  Ge  rgia  and  Moldavia  to make Janizaries  Besides this the  Inhumanity  of this Law which admits of a large Description and which has many Branches Tending to  Cruelty  cannot but fill the Minds of our Posterity with Abhorrence of the Church it self and so make the Breach wider than ever it was before As all the Sangninary Laws against the Reformation  and against the  Primitive Church  could never stop the Progress either of the  Christian  Religion at first or of the  Protestant  Religion afterwards so neither will this but will Confirm Establish and Encrease the Body of the  Dissenters  in this Nation To conclude all  The Methods which will also be still less to the  Dissenters  to evade this Act will of Course have one of these two Effects either which we earnestly wish it will cause the Church to see the Mistake and Repeal the Rigorous Law or as those who run into many Evils to Support and rather than Recant the first it will oblige them to such other and farther Steps of this Kind as must revive the severest Persecutions even to Death and Torture the Consequences we may reasonably expect will end in Judgment from Heaven and the Confusion of the Nation  We cannot but hope that these Things may prevail with our Legislators to consider what is before them and to examine as well the  Political  as the  Christian  Arguments which may be offer'd to them against this  Bill  Particularly how it strikes at the Foundation of Religion as Christian and tends to the Destroying the Light and Knowledge of Divine Things in the World which is the Honour of the Reformation Whereas if the Instruction of Children in the Knowledge of Religion is restrain'd loaded with Difficulties or limited it is thereby discouraged lessen'd and put backward which is contrary to the Practice of all the  Protestant Nations  in the World  Neither is it enough to say That the  Dissenters  are the Cause of such Discouragement for that they may send their Children to Learn the  Church Catechism  and to  Church Tutors  and  Schoolmasters  For if the Dissenters cannot in Conscience Conform neither can they in Conscience teach their Children to Conform and if that Principle  Conscience  obliges them to keep their Children without any Degree of Learning and Instruction which they would otherwise have had the Law that limits their Education to Terms which their Parents cannot comply with is the unrighteous Cause of that Defect and thus Ignorance flows in of Course It is to be hop'd the  Church of England  will not be thought to plant it self best in the Ignorance of the People Christian Knowledge is the Fountain of the Reformation of the Christian Religion  Popery  indeed may be said to be  Founded  in  Ignorance  and  propagated  in  Superstition  which is the Child of Stupidity and Blindness But  Knowledge  and the Light of the  Scriptures  were the Nurses and Founders of the Reformation and Woe be to that Nation or People or Body of Men who pretend to propagate the Christian Religion by Restraining the Knowledge of Religion in the Minds of the Younger Part of the Nation who it is their Duty by all possible Means to Instruct  We find in the Heads of the  Bill  now Depending some Things also more particularly Tending to Persecution than is yet mention'd  viz  The Engaging every one who shall have a License to Teach School never to be  present at a Meeting This is Restraining the said Teacher or Schoolmaster from his Liberty of Conscience to preserve his Livelyhood and making the Salary or Gain of his Employment to be a Snare to his Principles  What the Fines and Penalties are how Rigorous the Prosecution how the  Dissenters  are debarr'd from their Liberty of Appeal to Her Majesty's Superiour Courts of Justice and left to the Mercy of the  Justices  of the  Peace  without Appeal and how to be prosecuted in  Ecclesiastical Courts  where the ChurchMen who in this Cause are Parties are made Judges As these Things are apparent in the  Bill  so are they the Height of  Persecution  unprecedented and in their Nature an Oppression of our Civil Rights as  Englishmen  To close all How these Things agree with the  Toleration  is a Mystery I can by no Means reconcile Perhaps those who read the  Bills  both together and see how and where the Clauses join and where they part may see less of Persecution than I can and that all Men may do so and judge for themselves therefore are the Copies Published in this Manner  The BILL against  Schism  THAT whereas by an Act of Parliament in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Years of his late Majesty King  Charles  the Second intituled  An Act for the Uniformity of Publick Prayers and the Administration of the Sacrament and other Rites and Ceremonies and for Establishing the Form of Making Ordaining and Consecrating Bishops Priests and Deacons in the Church of  England it is among other Things enacted that every Schoolmaster keeping any Publick or Private School and every Person Instructing and Teaching any Youth or Private Family as a Tutor or Schoolmaster should subscribe before his or their Respective Bishop or Archbishop or

Reward taken than the Sum of Six Pence  QUERIES Humbly Propos'd to My LORDS the BISHOPS upon Occasion of the BILL now Depending in the HOUSE of PEERS to prevent as is pleaded  The Growth of Schism  Query  I HOW  Schism  can be prevented before 'tis clearly determined what it is And whether those Men canjustly be charged with it who are united to the Common Head of the Christian Church by  Faith  and to all its Members by an hearty  Love  And whether Dissenters are not within the  Church  as it is defin'd by the th Article of the  Church of England  having  the pure Word of God preach'd amongst them and the Sacraments duly administred according to Christ's Ordinance in all Things that of Necessity are requisite to the same  II HOW any National Church as far as it is favour'd or warranted by the Holy Scriptures which all Protestants own for their Rule can be in any Real Danger from such Persons  as those describ'd or from their being left at Liberty to Educate their Children in their own Way  III WHETHER it be not a Piece of Wisdom to learn from our Enemies And when even in the  Romish  Communion notwithstanding their High Pretensions to  Unity  and  Uniformity  there is yet a great Diversity admitted amongst their Religious Orders why should not  Protestants  inlarge and strengthen themselves by enclosing All they can in a Way of Forbearance especially when they heartily fall in with the same Civil Government  IV ARE not the  French  and  Dutch  Protestant Churches to our great Satisfaction allowed to Educate their own Children without Dishonour or Damage to the Church or State And shall this Privilege be deny'd to Natives that are Faithful and Peaceable meerly because they are Dissenters  V WHETHER the treating such as  Schismaticks  in the Reign of King  Charles  II to look no farther back was not sensibly found to promote the  Growth of Popery  And whether it may not reasonably be expected that a like Cause should have a like Effect  VI WHETHER in the Reign that succeeded it was not own'd by some Eminent Prelates of the Church with Archbishop  Sancroft  at their Head as well as by the Noble Marquess of  Halifax  in his  Letter to the Dissenters  in which so many eminent Persons concurred and which all at that Time applauded that too much Rigour had been us'd towards Persons of the same Religion for differing in smaller  Matters And whether Promises were not then freely made of a different Treatment and a better Temper for the Future from the Pulpit and the Press and in all Conversation  VII WHETHER the Bishops that have been advanc'd to that Honour since the  Revolution  who have generally been Persons of the greatest Eminence for their Worth and Moderation have not met with more Respect from the Dissenters than from many who pretended to be zealous Members of their own Church And whether it is a suitable Return for Persons of their Lordships Candour to deal more hardly by us as to our Children than their Predecessors ever attempted to do by our Fathers as to their Descendants  VIII WHETHER any Thing more tenderly affected the Protestants in  France  than the denying them Liberty to Educate their Children in their own Principles And whether that Method which has all along been represented as so severe in a  Popish Prince  can never be fit to be countenanced by  Protestant Bishops  in a  Protestant Country  IX WHETHER if  Popery  should once more prevail among us which some who are Ornaments to the Bench of Bishops have owned to be no very remote Supposition it would be a most grating Reflection when the Legislators should demand the Education of the Children of all  Protestants  to hear them insinuate That their Lordships had set them the Pattern by demanding the Education of the Children of  Dissenters  X WHETHER it can reasonably be expected that they should ever have the Courage to endure the Fiery Trial which is what according to the foregoing Supposition they may be called to who by any Political Considerations should be kept from sheltring the Innocent And whether upon Supposition any Members of their own Church should threaten them if they acted according to the Principles by which they obtained their Preferments it would not be more becoming to inform them better and yield more Comfort to set them an Example of Steadiness than to harden and embolden them by yielding to them in a Method of treating Brethren that is neither Scriptural nor Rational  XI WHETHER it be seemly for Guides of the Church to pass such a Censure upon the  Assemblie  's  Catechism  as if it were not fit to be Taught when there is nothing to be found in it but what agrees with the Doctrine and nothing that is opposite to the Government of their own Church And how it can be reconcil'd with the Honour and Veracity of their Lordships to allow no other Catechism than that which cannot be answer'd to with Truth by the Children of Dissenters who had no Godfathers or Godmothers to give them their Names or promise for them  XII WHETHER the  Ecclesiastical Courts  have not from the first Reformation been own'd a great Grievance by the best Prelates and Members of the  Church of England  Whether they have not upon Occasion been freely inveigh'd against by many who are at present on the  Bishops bench And Whether there be any such Evidence of their Amendment as can justify their now concurring to support and in courage them  AND Lastly WHETHER the passing such a Bill into a Law be not more likely to spread Animosity increase Uncharitableness and perpetuate Division than prevent the Growth of what is call'd  Schism  And Whether this be not as evident as that publickly branding a Body of Men will inflame the Populace against them and that Severity on the other Hand tends to exasperate the Sufferers  My Lords the Bishops are earnestly requested to take these Things into their serious Consideration by several of the Descendants of those very  Presbyterians  who earnestly tho' invain implor'd the Compassion of their Predecessors in    and by many that have join'd with them in waiting for the fulfilling their Promises in    and    And who most heartily beg of Almighty GOD they may never fall into the same Extremities or worse by having our Common Hopes which depend upon the Protestant Succession in the Illustrious House of  HANOVER  defeated according to some Mens Desires and Wishes which we pray may never take Effect  FINIS
