 THE PLEASURES OF MELANCHOLY A POEM  Praecipe lugubres  Cantus Melpomene  HOR  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's Head in  Pallmall  and sold by M COOPER at the  Globe  in  PaternosterRow  Price One Shilling  THE PLEASURES OF MELANCHOLY  MOther of Musings  Contemplation  sage  Whose mansion is upon the topmost cliff  Of cloudcapt Teneriff in secret bow'r  Where ever wrapt in meditation high  Thou hear'st unmov'd in dark tempestuous night  The loud winds howl around the beating rain  And the big hail in mingling storm descend  Upon his horrid brow But when the skies  Unclouded shine and thro' the blue serene  Pale Cynthia rolls her silveraxled car  Then ever looking on the spangled vault  Raptur'd thou sit'st while murmurs indistinct  Of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear  With hoarse and hollow sounds secure selfblest  Oft too thou listen'st to the wild uproar  Of fleets encount'ring that in whispers low  Ascends the rocky summit where thou dwell'st  Remote from man conversing with the spheres  O lead me blackbrow'd  to solemn glooms  Cogenial with my soul to chearless shades  To ruin'd seats to twilight cells and bow'rs  Where thoughtful  Melancholy  loves to muse  Her fav'rite midnight haunts The laughing scenes  Of purple Spring where all the wanton train  Of Smiles and Graces seem to lead the dance  In sportive round while from their hands they show'r  Ambrosial blooms and flow'rs no longer charm  Tempe no more I court thy balmy breeze  Adieu green vales embroider'd meads adieu  Beneath yon' ruin'd Abbey's mossgrown piles  Oft let me sit at twilight hour of Eve  Where thro' some western window the pale moon  Pours her longlevell'd rule of streaming light  While sullen sacred silence reigns around  Save the lone Screechowl's note whose bow'r is built  Amid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp  And the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves  Of flaunting Ivy that with mantle green  Invests some sacred tow'r Or let me tread  It's neighb'ring walk of pines where stray'd of old  The cloyster'd brothers thro' the gloomy void  That far extends beneath their ample arch  As on I tread religious horror wraps  My soul in dread repose But when the world  Is clad in Midnight's ravencolour'd robe  In hollow charnel let me watch the flame  Of taper dim while airy voices talk  Along the glimm'ring walls or ghostly shape  At distance seen invites with beck'ning hand  My lonesome steps thro' the farwinding vaults  Nor undelightful is the solemn noon  Of night when haply wakeful from my couch  I start lo all is motionless around  Roars not the rushing wind the sons of men  And every beast in mute oblivion lie  All Nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep  O then how fearful is it to reflect  That thro' the solitude of the still globe  No Being wakes but me 'till stealing sleep  My drooping temples baths in opiate dews  Nor then let dreams of wanton Folly born  My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy  But let the sacred Genius of the night  Such mystic visions send as SPENSER saw  When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze  To the bright regions of the fairy world  Soar'd his creative mind or MILTON knew  When in abstracted thought he first conceiv'd  All heav'n in tumult and the Seraphim  Come tow'ring arm'd in adamant and gold  Let others love the Summerev'ning's smiles  As list'ning to some distant waterfall  They mark the blushes of the streaky west  I choose the pale December's foggy glooms  Then when the sullen shades of Ev'ning close  Where thro' the room a blindlyglimm'ring gleam  The dying embers scatter far remote  From Mirth's mad shouts that thro' the lighted roof  Resound with festive echo let me sit  Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge  Then let my contemplative thought explore  This fleeting state of things the vain delights  The fruitless toils that still elude our search  As thro' the wilderness of life we rove  This sober hour of silence will unmask  False Folly's smiles that like the dazling spells  Of wily Comus cheat th' unweeting eye  With blear illusion and persuade to drink  The charmed cup that Reason's mintage fair  Unmoulds and stamps the monster on the man  Eager we taste but in the luscious draught  Forget the pois'nous dregs that lurk beneath  Few know that Elegance of soul refin'd  Whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy  From Melancholy's scenes than the dull pride  Of tasteless splendor and magnificence  Can e'er afford Thus Eloise whose mind  Had languish'd to the pangs of melting love  More secret transport found as on some tomb  Reclin'd she watch'd the tapers of the dead  Or thro' the pillar'd isles amid the shrines  Of imag'd saints and intermingled graves  Which scarce the story'd windows dim disclos'd  Musing she wander'd than Cosmelia finds  As thro' the Mall in silken pomp array'd  She floats amid the gilded sons of dress  And shines the fairest of th' assembled Belles  When azure noontide chears the daedal globe  And the glad regent of the golden day  Rejoices in his bright meridian bow'r  How oft my wishes ask the night's return  That best befriends the melancholy mind  Hail sacred Night to thee my song I raise  Sister of ebonscepter'd Hecat hail  Whether in congregated clouds thou wrap'st  Thy viewless chariot or with silver crown  Thy beaming head encirclest ever hail  What tho' beneath thy gloom the Lapland witch  Oft celebrates her mooneclipsing rites  Tho' Murther wan beneath thy shrouding shade  Oft calls her silent vot'ries to devise  Of blood and slaughter while by one blue lamp  In secret conf'rence sits the list'ning band  And start at each low wind or wakeful sound  What tho' thy stay the Pilgrim curses oft  As all benighted in Arabian wastes  He hears the howling wilderness resound  With roaming monsters while on his hoar head  The blackdescending tempest ceaseless beats  Yet more delightful to my pensive mind  Is thy return than bloomy Morn's approach  When from the portals of the saffron East  She sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews  Yet not ungrateful is the Morn's approach  When dropping wet she comes and clad in clouds  While thro' the damp air scowls the peevish South  And the dusk landschape rises dim to view  Th' afflicted songsters of the sadden'd groves  Hail not the sullen gloom but silent droop  The waving elms that rang'd in thick array  Enclose with stately row some rural hall  Are mute nor echo with the clamors hoarse  Of rooks rejoicing on their hoary boughs  While to the shed the dripping poultry croud  A mournful train secure the villagehind  Hangs o'er the crackling blaze nor tempts the storm  Rings not the high wood with enliv'ning shouts  Of early hunter all is silence drear  And deepest sadness wraps the face of things  Thro' POPE's soft song tho' all the Graces breath  And happiest art adorn his Attic page  Yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow  As at the foot of some hoar oak reclin'd  In magic SPENSER's wildlywarbled song  I see deserted Una wander wide  Thro' wasteful solitudes and lurid heaths  Weary forlorn than when the  Belinda Vid  Rape of the Lock  fated Fair  Upon the bosom bright of silver Thames  Launches in all the lustre of Brocade  Amid the splendors of the laughing Sun  The gay description palls upon the sense  And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss  O wrap me then in shades of darksom pine  Bear me to caves by desolation brown  To dusky vales and hermithaunted rocks  And hark methinks resounding from the gloom  The voice of Melancholy strikes mine ear  "Come leave the busy trifles of vain life  "And let these twilight mansions teach thy mind  "The Joys of Musing and of solemn Thought"  Ye youths of Albion's beautyblooming isle  Whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love  Is there a pleasure like the pensive mood  Whose magic wont to sooth your soften'd souls  O tell how rapt'rous is the deepfelt bliss  To melt to Melody's assuasive voice  Careless to stray the midnight mead along  And pour your sorrows to the pitying moon  Oft interrupted by the Bird of Woe  To muse by margin of romantic stream  To fly to solitudes and there forget  The solemn dulness of the tedious world  'Till in abstracted dreams of fancy lost  Eager you snatch the visionary fair  And on the phantom feast your cheated gaze  Sudden you startth' imagin'd joys recede  The same sad prospect opens on your sense  And nought is seen but deepextended trees  In hollow rows and your awaken'd ear  Again attends the neighb'ring fountain's sound  These are delights that absence drear has made  Familiar to my soul er'e since the form  Of young Sapphira beauteous as the Spring  When from her vi'letwoven couch awak'd  By frolic Zephyr's hand her tender cheek  Graceful she lifts and blushing from her bow'r  Issues to cloath in gladsomeglist'ring green  The genial globe first met my dazled sight  These are delights unknown to minds profane  And which alone the pensive soul can taste  The taper'd choir at midnight hour of Pray'r  Oft let me tread while to th' according voice  The manysounding organ peals on high  In fullvoic'd chorus thro' th' embowed roof  'Till all my soul is bath'd in ecstasies  And lap'd in Paradise Or let me sit  Far in some distant isle of the deep dome  There lonesome listen to the solemn sounds  Which as they lengthen thro' the Gothic vaults  In hollow murmurs reach my ravish'd ear  Nor let me fail to cultivate my mind  With the soft thrillings of the tragic Muse  Divine Melpomene sweet Pity's nurse  Queen of the stately step and flowing pall  Now let Monimia mourn with streaming eyes  Her joys incestuous and polluted love  Now let Calista dye the desperate steel  Within her bosom for lost innocence  Unable to behold a father weep  Or Jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look  Nor seldom let the Moor on Desdemone  Pour the misguided threats of jealous rage  By soft degrees the manly torrent steals  From my swoln eyes and at a brother's woe  My big heart melts in sympathizing tears  What are the splendors of the gaudy court  It's tinsel trappings and it's pageant pomps  To me far happier seems the banish'd Lord  Amid Siberia's unrejoycing wilds  Who pines all lonesome in the chambers hoar  Of some high castle shut whose windows dim  In distant ken discover trackless plains  Where Winter ever drives his icy car  While still repeated objects of his view  The gloomy battlements and ivied tow'rs  That crown the solitary dome arise  While from the topmost turret the slow clock  Far heard along th' inhospitable wastes  With sadreturning chime awakes new grief  Than is the Satrap whom he left behind  In Moscow's regal palaces to drown  In ease and luxury the laughing hours  Illustrious objects strike the gazer's mind  With feeble bliss and but allure the sight  Nor rouze with impulse quick the feeling heart  Thus seen by shepherd from Hymettus' brow  What painted landschapes spread their charms beneath  Here palmy groves amid whose umbrage green  Th' unfading olive lifts her silver head  Resounding once with Plato's voice arise  Here vineclad hills unfold their purple stores  Here fertile vales their level lap expand  Amid whose beauties glistering Athens tow'rs  Tho' thro' the graceful seats Ilissus roll  His sageinspiring flood whose fabled banks  The spreading laurel shades tho' roseate Morn  Pour all her splendors on th' empurpled scene  Yet feels the musing Hermit truer joys  As from the cliff that o'er his cavern hangs  He views the piles of fall'n Persepolis  In deep arrangement hide the darksome plain  Unbounded waste the mould'ring Obelisc  Here like a blasted oak ascends the clouds  Here Parian domes their vaulted halls disclose  Horrid with thorn where lurks the secret thief  Whence flits the twilightloving bat at eve  And the deaf adder wreaths her spotted train  The dwellings once of Elegance and Art  Here temples rise amid whose hallow'd bounds  Spires the black pine while thro' the naked street  Haunt of the tradeful merchant springs the grass  Here columns heap'd on prostrate columns torn  From their firm base encrease the mould'ring mass  Far as the sight can pierce appear the spoils  Of sunk magnificence a blended scene  Of moles fanes arches domes and palaces  Where with his brother horror ruin sits  O come then  Melancholy  queen of thought  O come with saintly look and stedfast step  From forth thy cave embower'd with mournful yew  Where ever to the cu  sound  List'ning thou sitt'st and  ress bind  Thy votary's hair and seal him s  y son  But never let Euphrosyne beguile  With toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind  Nor with her primrose garlands strew my paths  What tho' with her the dimpled Hebe dwells  With youngey'd Pleasure and the looserob'd Joy  Tho' Venus mother of the Smiles and Loves  And Bacchus ivycrown'd in myrtle bow'r  With her in dance fantastic beat the ground  What tho' 'tis her's to calm the blue serene  And at her presence mild the low'ring clouds  Disperse in air and o'er the face of heav'n  New day diffusive glows at her approach  Yet are these joys that Melancholy gives  By Contemplation taught her sister sage  Than all her witless revels happier far  Then ever beauteous Contemplation hail  From thee began auspicious maid my song  With thee shall end for thou art fairer far  Than are the nymphs of Cirrha's mossy grot  To loftier rapture thou canst wake the thought  Than all the fabling Poet's boasted pow'rs  Hail queen divine whom as tradition tells  Once in his ev'ningwalk a Druid found  Far in a hollow glade of Mona's woods  And piteous bore with hospitable hand  To the close shelter of his oaken bow'r  There soon the Sage admiring mark'd the dawn  Of solemn Musing in thy pensive thought  For when a smiling babe you lov'd to lie  Oft deeply list'ning to the rapid roar  Of woodhung Meinai stream of Druids old  That lav'd his hallow'd haunt with dashing wave  FINIS
