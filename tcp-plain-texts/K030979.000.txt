SCENE I  Miss ANGLE  and  FISH  discovered  Miss ANGLE  THERE's somebody at the door Fish'tis Lady Mary Magpielet her ineven her ridiculous vanity is more supportable than the reflection on my own  FISH  Lady Mary ma'am  Opens the door  Enter  Lady MARY  Miss ANGLE  Goodmorrow dear Lady Mary  Lady MARY  Nay sit stilland Mrs Fish do you stayI have brought something to shew your mistress and you may see it too if she will give you leave  Miss ANGLE  CertainlyFish you may stay  Lady MARY  There  Opening a shawl  What do you think of thatA present from Mr Walmsleya shawl worth at a moderate valuation no less than a hundred and fifty guineasHe gave it me this minuteit came over but last night from Indiahas been on the seas seven monthswas in that terrible storm of October lastLittle did I think when I heard of those dreadful wrecks and the many souls that perished that I had a shawl at sea if I had I should have suffered a martyrdomNow is not it prettyBeautifulHe assures me his correspondent writes him word "There is but one more such in all India"And I'm to wear it the first time on my weddingday  Miss ANGLE  It is very beautiful indeed  Lady MARY  An't you well my dearYou don't seem to understand it's valueWhat do you say to it Mrs Fish  FISH  Oh madamI like it of all things  Lady MARY  I dare say you doBut come my dear Miss Angle what's the matter with you Since you first came to town you are the most altered creature I ever saw  FISH  Your Ladyship does not think my mistress has lost any of her beauty I hope  Lady MARY  As for that Mrs Fish I dare say your Lady has made observation enough to know that beauty is of little weight here  of no signification at allBeauty in London is so cheap and consequently so common to the men of fashion who are prodigiously fond of novelty that they absolutely begin to fall in love with the ugly women by way of change  FISH  And does your Ladyship think old women will ever come into fashion  Lady MARY  They are in fashionthey have been in fashion some timeGirls and young women have made themselves so cheap they are quite out  Miss ANGLE  I believe so  Aside  Lady MARY  As soon as the vulgar lay hold of any thing the people of ton leave it offSuch is the case with young womenThe vulgar have laid hold of them and they are quite out  FISH  Oh dear me  Lady MARY  But come my dear Angle pluck up your spirits against you know whenyou are to be one of my bridemaids you knowOh how I long to be away from lodgings and in a house of my ownMr Walmsley says he shall invite you to stay a day or two with usHe likes you stranger as you are to us both very much I assure youHe is a great admirer of virtue in us females and notwithstanding his little oddities would do any thing for a woman of character and your refusing that vile Lord's odious addresses which I inform'd him of has interested him for you exceedingly  Well heaven bless youI can't stayhe'll be quite impatient  Going  I may tell him you like the shawl I suppose  Miss ANGLE  Beautiful beyond measure  Lady MARY  And you Mrs Fish  FISH  Charming ma'am  Lady MARY  Did I tell you there was but one more such in all India  Coming back  Miss ANGLE  You did  Lady MARY  Only think of it's being in that storm  Exit  Miss ANGLE  Would I had been in the storm and had fallen it's victim  FISH  Dear madam  Miss ANGLE  Oh Fish that woman's nonsense at which you laugh'd was graced with sentiments of the strictest truthYoung women are no longer thought of hereHow rashly did I give credit to our foolish country peopleThey told me that "Tho' only admired by them in London I shou'd be adoredthat beauty here was rarethat virtue"  FISH  Well madam and that is rare every body knows  Miss ANGLE  But is it valuedNoAs soon as I gave Lord Lighthead proofs of my possessing it what was the consequenceI have neither seen nor heard of him since  FISH  That's very oddFor my part I thought him so much in loveAnd sometimes I thought you looked a little  Miss ANGLE  That I felt a warmtha something like tenderness for him I own but that it was the effect of love I will not pretend to sayIt was perhaps the effect of hopePride too had a great share in the agitation of my heartand gratitude might have confirm'd the whole sensation loveBut in the moment gratitude shou'd have been inspired resentment indignation took possessionand I am now left solely to shame and disappointment  FISH  Wellit's very odd that a man should give himself so much trouble to come here after you so many times as he did and then all of a sudden never to come near you for a whole monthI should not mind losing him neither if some duke or other great man would come instead of him or even that strange young man we met on the road as we came to town and that was so kind to us when our chaise broke down  Miss ANGLE  Honest creature  FISH  Well as sure as ever I was in love in my life that young man and his servant were both as deep in love  Miss ANGLE  With me  FISH  No the master with you and the man with meBut we I thought were coming to town to make our fortune and so I was above  making it on the roadFor notwithstanding that young man looked so countrified and had hardly a word to say for himself he's worth thousandsAnd poor Humphry his servant persuaded me to give him our direction that his master and he might come after us to LondonAnd yet to see the fickleness of man we have heard nor seen nothing of themBut dear madam his Lordship runs most in my headPerhaps he is sick  Miss ANGLE  Nohe visits the drawingroom constantly as we read in the papersI wonder what he wou'd say if he was accidentally to meet me  FISH  He'd fall in love with you as much as everSuppose madam you was to write to him  Miss ANGLE  For shame  FISH  Dear madam I know a few lines from you wou'd cheer his heart and he would be as dying for you as everOh when I have given him a letter from you how he has jumped for joy how he has kiss'd it and how he has kiss'd me  Miss ANGLE  Cou'd I write to him with any appearance of prudencefor instance upon any businessI shou'd have no objection it wou'd at least remind him of me and bring matters to a decision  FISH  Then do madam contrive to write to him about some business  Miss ANGLE  What business can I pretend  FISH  Dear madam if you had a handsome piece of silk for a gown or a diamond pin or something of that kind you might return it him back again  Miss ANGLE  Return it him again What do you mean  FISH  Why madam you might send it him backas if you had received the present from a person unknown and concluding that it  must  come from his Lordship you had thought proper to return itand so you might send him with it a fine long virtuous letter that "you wou'd not receive a present from a king that had evil designs upon you" and so onand so onand so onThis I am sure would make him ten times fonder of you than everfor he would think some rival had been sending you the present in that anonymous manner which had made you think it was himand I know he wou'd  Miss ANGLE  I protest there is something in that scheme which pleases me  FISH  Do it madamdo it  Miss ANGLE  But how can II have nothing of valuenothing that I cou'd suppose he wou'd send for a present and which I could think of consequence enough to return  FISH  What's your watch madam  Miss ANGLE  An old fashion'd thing  FISH  Lord I have thought of something The finest thing  Miss ANGLE  What  FISH  Lady Mary Magpie's shawlYou known ma'am 'tis the finest thing in the worldThere is but one more such in all the universe  Miss ANGLE  But the shawl is not mine  FISH  No ma'ambut I dare say I know where her ladyship has laid it and I can get it  Going to the door  Miss ANGLE  For shame  FISH  Dear madam do you think I'd steal itIt cou'd do it no harm to be a few hours at his Lordship'sHe'd send it back directly you may depend upon thatAnd then such a fine thingIt would make him think that some great man indeed had taken a fancy to youand he'd be so afraid of losing you  Miss ANGLE  WellI protestif I thought  FISH  I can get it ma'am with all the ease in the worldI dare say  Runs out  Miss ANGLE  What will become of meWhere will my folly end  Enter  FISH  FISH  Yesyesma'am I can get ither Ladyship has spread it on the bed in the blue chamber and is gone out for the whole evening  and will sleep at her cousin's Lady Beach'sher maid told me so in the morning  Miss ANGLE  But suppose his Lordship should not return it  FISH  Laud ma'am do you think his Lordship will keep it when he'll know he did not send it youHis Lordship is not a thief I supposeYou'll have it back ma'am I'll answer for it in an hour or two and himself with itThe person shan't leave it ma'am if his Lordship is not at home and then you'll be sure to have it in an hour or twoI'll go steal itI'll go steal it  Going  Miss ANGLE  Steal it  FISH  Take it ma'amnot steal it  Exit  Miss ANGLE  This scheme will at least renew our acquaintanceand that is all I wantfor if on the renewal he appears cold I will leave London instantlyif on the contrary he is as much in love as ever  Enter  FISH  with the Shawl  FISH  I have got itI have got ithere it isNow madam come into your bed chamber and write a very affecting letter while I do it up and send for a porter  Miss ANGLE  I protest I am frighten'dtho' we take it but to return again  FISH  Dear madam I am sure it is not in half the danger as when it was in the great storm  Pulling her off  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Chamber at  Lord LIGHTHEAD's  Enter  Miss AUDLEY  and  THOMPSON  Miss AUDLEY  Whathis Lordship is gone to see Lady Loveall thus early I suppose or rather has staid with her thus late  THOMPSON  You are just like her Ladyship ma'am for she is ever accusing my Lord of being with

are a fellow that falls in love with every face you see and yet admire your own more than any one of themYou are a man whose purse is open to every gambler and courtezan and is never shut but to objects of real distress  Lord LIGHTH  But how are you informed of this  WALMSLEY  Hear ittold of it by every bodyDo you think any thing but conviction would have forced me to the rash step I have takenWou'd any thing but a certainty that you were unworthy to be my heir have forced  me to the desperate resolution of marrying notwithstanding my natural aversion to opposition  Lord LIGHTH  I hope Sir when you marry  WALMSLEY  Hope PshawI know well enough what marriage is'Tis a poesy of thornsnobody knows where to lay hold of it'Tis a stormy sea where nothing is to be expected but squalls tempests and shipwrecksOne cries "Help"another "Lord have mercy upon us"a third "'Tis all over with us"and souse they all go into the ocean of calamity  Lord LIGHTH  Then for heaven's sake Sir if this is your opinion decline your intention of marrying  WALMSLEY  I can't'tis too latemy word is pass'dYour indiscretions put me in a passion and I took a rash stepa step I never intended to takeI offered a lady to marry her in the heat of anger and she took me at my word before I had time to grow cool and recant  Lord LIGHTH  How unfortunate  WALMSLEY  I was not aware she would be so suddenbut I was in such a violent passionall against you for your folliesI was devilish hot I don't remember that I was ever in such a heat in my life I struttedand frettedand walk'dand talk'dall in anger against  you which she took for love to her and so was overcome in less than ten minutes  Lord LIGHTH  Dear Sir had I been present  WALMSLEY  Why then I should have broken every bone in your skinBut as it wasI vented my ragein kissing the lady and won her heart without farther troubleIt's impossible I could have won her so soon but by my being in that violent rage for she's a particular prudent discreet reserv'd middleaged woman and nothing but my great violence cou'd have had that effect upon her  Lord LIGHTH  But Sir is it possible that you should pay attention to a rash promise in a moment of anger  WALMSLEY  My wordMy word is as dear to me as my honorIt is my honorand I cannot keep one without keeping both  Lord LIGHTH  But now you are cool Sir  WALMSLEY  Yes I am coolbut now the lady is in a passionand I must keep my word with her tho' I am afraid she'll never find me  warm  on the subject again  Lord LIGHTH  Dear Sir And all this to revenge yourself on me A man whose greatest faults arise merely from the report of malicious enemies  WALMSLEY  EnemiesPshawThat's always your excuseBut have not I enemies  as well as you And yet I dare say you never heard of my being caught gallanting my neighbour's wifeOr walking arminarm with a a milliner Or following fine ladies home to their lodgingsNor did you ever hear me accused of destroying a beautiful young woman's peace of mindDid you  Lord LIGHTH  I can't say I ever did Sir  WALMSLEY  Then don't pretend to deny the reports I have heard of youDon't I know that you were caught with Lady Loveall and  Lord LIGHTH  I own Sir I have been very unfortunate as to AppearancesAppearances and those alone have been the ruin of my reputationaccidents so strange that no human wisdom cou'd prevent or avoid themI have been found for instance with a female whom I never had the smallest familiarity with in the most suspicious situations and only by mere accident  WALMSEY  And pray was that an accident when I caught you kissing my housekeeper's daughter as if you'd devour her  Lord LIGHTH  Yes upon my word Sir that was an accidententirely an accidentMy servant had just lost me a favorite spaniel and had the rascal been in the way I shou'd have broken every bone in his skin but happening to meet with this poor girl I vented my rage on her  WALMSLEY  Then I have only to say you have lost my estate by your accidents

forThe gift itselfhonour delicacy and a thousand struggling sensations force me to returnand to add that my residence in London has not yet so entirely eradicated those principles imbibed in the country as to render a gaudy bait even an allurement except in its being a proof that your Lordship sometimes honours with a thought the humble but contented LOUISA ANGLE"  Lord LIGHTH  Angle

my senses I have forgot itWhat is it  Opens the parcel  Zounds but it is very handsome and the very thing to present to Lady LoveallIt will reconcile her to me immediatelyfor I am afraid she suspects

placejust as I got under cover three or four or five or six or egad there might be a dozen fine ladies met me and one of them did give me such a slap in the face the water came into my eyes again  CLOWNLY  What did she do that for  HUMPH  I can't tell for the life of meFor I pull'd off my hat and made them a civil bowbut faith as soon as I felt the blow I forgot my manners for after madam I ran and gave her such a shake  CLOWNLY  You did not  HUMPH  But I didand that was not the worst of it neitherI made a sad mistakefor when I came to look the lady had got a blue gown on and she that gave me the blow was in red  CLOWNLY  How cou'd you make such a blunder  HUMPH  Why tho' their gowns were different their faces were exactly the same colour  CLOWNLY  But about Miss Anglehave you seen her or her maid  HUMPH  YesI have seen Mrs Fish and she says that her Lady has done nothing but  talk of you ever since you left her on the roadand she desires you will go and see her Lady directlyAnd she says too that she'll get us a lodging in the same house before night but that is to be kept a secret from her mistress  CLOWNLY  I am very much obliged to Mrs Fish for her contrivance and I shall give her a very handsome present to satisfy her  HUMPH  Lord Sir there is no occasion for thatI shall kiss her now and then and I dare say that will be quite satisfaction enough But come Sir we must go directly  CLOWNLY  Do you know Humphry that my heart misgives me  HUMPH  What now you are so near seeing the Lady Come come master be merry  CLOWNLY  Ah Humphry if I had continued poorif I had never been your master I might have been merry  HUMPH  "Never been my master"How can you talk so Why there are people in the world would give any money to be my masterWhy now there's my wifeshe'd give every farthing she has to be my master but I tell her NoNo Jane says I you shall never be my master  CLOWNLY  Oh if I thought I should get Miss Angle  HUMPH  I'll forfeit my head if you don'tHave you not every thing to get her with  Fine clothes in your box there and plenty of moneyI never heard of a woman that cou'd not be got with fine clothes and plenty of money nay often without either money or clothes  CLOWNLY  But I tell you that won't do with herthere is something more requiredI can't talk to herI am at a loss for words  HUMPH  You can't be at a loss for words while you are courtingWomen will always give you two for your oneI know my wife didand egad tho' we have left off courting so she does now  CLOWNLY  ComeI'll set offCall a coach  Exit  HUMPH  Ay Sir and I'll ride behind it for

ANGLE  Mr Clownly while you imagine you are giving your protection to a thief onlyyou are protecting a more despicable characterHad poverty seduced me to the crime of which I am accused less wou'd have been my remorse less ought to have been the censure incurredBut vanityfollya mistaken confidence in that gentleman's honour and my own attractions prompted me to avail myself of a contemptible scheme in order to regain his acquaintance  which admitting what he profess'd to me real he himself wou'd have rejoiced atBut the event has proved and discovered both our heartsnor can I reproach him with the cruelty of his while I experience the most poignant reproofs of an inward monitor for the guilty folly of my own  Lady LOVEALL  And so this was only a scheme for the Lady to procure a husbandHere Lady Mary is your beloved shawlTake it and take care  WALMSLEY  Yes do you take care of that and I'll take care of myselfYet I don't know perhaps I may have her but if I may judge by
