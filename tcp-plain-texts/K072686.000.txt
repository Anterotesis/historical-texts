 EURIPIDES  BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DODSLEY PALLMALL  MDCCLXXX  ODE c  FAV'RITE of Heaven and friend of Earth  Philanthropy benignant Power  Whose sons display no doubtful worth  The pageant of the passing hour  Teach me to paint in deathless song  Some darling from thy filial throng  Whose deeds no partyrage inspire  But fill th' agreeing world with one desire  To echo his renown responsive to my lyre  Ah whither lead'st thouwhence that sigh  What sound of woe my bosom jars  Why pass where Misery's hollow eye  Glares wildly thro' those gloomy bars  Is Virtue sunk in these abodes  Where keen Remorse the heart corrodes  Where Guilt's base blood with frenzy boils  And Blasphemy the mournful scene embroils  From this infernal gloom my shudd'ring soul recoils  But whence those sudden sacred beams  Oppression drops his iron rod  And all the bright'ning dungeon seems  To speak the presence of a God  Philanthropy's descending ray  Diffuses unexpected day  Loveliest of angelsat her side  Her favourite votary standsher English pride  Thro' Horror's mansions led by this celestial guide  Hail generous HOWARD tho' thou bear  A name which Glory's hand sublime  Has blazon'd oft with guardian care  In characters that fear not Time  For thee she fondly spreads her wings  For thee from Paradise she brings  More verdant than her laurel bough  Such wreaths of sacred Palm as ne'er till now  The smiling Seraph twin'd around a mortal brow  That Hero's  CHARLES HOWARD Earl of Nottingham  praise shall ever bloom  Who shielded our insulted coast  And launch'd his light'ning to consume  The proud Invader's routed host  Brave perils rais'd his noble name  But thou deriv'st thy matchless fame  From scenes where deadlier danger dwells  Where fierce Contagion with affright repels  Valor's advent'rous step from her malignant cells  Where in the dungeon's loathsome shade  The speechless Captive clanks his chain  With heartless hope to raise that aid  His feeble cries have call'd in vain  Thine eye his dumb complaint explores  Thy voice his parting breath restores  Thy cares his ghastly visage clear  From Death's chill dew with many a clotted tear  And to his thankful soul returning life endear  What precious Drug or stronger Charm  Thy constant fortitude inspires  In scenes whence muttering her alarm  Med'cine  Mussabat tacito Medecina timore  LUGRETIUS  with selfish dread retires  Nor Charm nor Drug dispel thy fears  Temperance thy better guard appears  For thee I see her fondly fill  Her crystal cup from Nature's purest rill  Chief nourisher of life best antidote of ill  I see the hallow'd shade of HALES  STEPHEN HALES minister of Teddington he died at the age of and has been justly called  An ornament to his profession as a clergyman and to his country as a philosopher  I had the happiness of knowing this excellent man when I was very young and well remember the warm glow of benevolence which used to animate his countenance in relating the success of his various projects for the benefit of mankind I have frequently heard him dwell with great pleasure on the fortunate incident which led him to the discovery of his Ventilator to which I have alludedHe had ordered a new floor for one of his rooms his carpenter not having prepared the work so soon as he expected he thought the season improper for laying down new boards when they were brought to his house and gave orders for their being deposited in his barnfrom their accidental position in that place he cauglit his first idea of this useful invention  Who felt like thee for human woe  And taught the healthdiffusing gales  Thro' Horror's murky cells to blow  As thy protecting angel wait  To save thee from the snares of Fate  Commission'd from the Eternal Throne  I hear him praise in wonder's warmest tone  The virtues of thy heart more active than his own  Thy soul supplies new funds of health  That fail not in the trying hour  Above Arabia's spicy wealth  And Pharmacy's reviving power  The transports of the generous mind  Feeling its bounty to mankind  Inspirit every mortal part  And far more potent than precarious art  Give radiance to the eye and vigor to the heart  Blest HOWARD who like thee can feel  This vital spring in all its force  New star of philanthropic zeal  Enlight'ning nations in thy course  And shedding Comfort's heavenly dew  On meagre Want's deserted crew  Friend to the wretch whom friends disclaim  Who feels stern Justice in his famish'd frame  A persecuting fiend beneath an angel's name  Authority unfeeling power  Whose iron heart can coldly doom  The Debtor drag'd from Pleasure's bower  To sicken in the dungeon's gloom  O might thy terrorstriking call  Profusion's sons alone enthrall  But thou canst Want with Guilt confound  Thy bonds the man of virtuous toil surround  Driven by malicious Fate within thy dreary bound  How savage are thy stern decrees  Thy cruel minister I see  A weak laborious victim seize  By worth entitled to be free  Behold in the afflicting strife  The faithful partner of his life  In vain thy ruthless servant court  To spare her little children's sole support  Whom this terrific form has frighten'd from their sport  Nor weeps she only from the thought  Those infants must no longer share  His aid whose daily labour bought  The pittance of their scanty fare  The horrors of the loathsome jail  Her inlybleeding heart assail  E'en now her fears from fondness bred  See the lost partner of her faithful bed  Drop in that murd'rous scene his pale expiring head  Take comfort yet in these keen pains  Fond mourner check thy gushing tears  The dungeon now no more contains  Those perils which thy fancy fears  No more Contagion's baleful breath  Speaks it the hideous cave of Death  HOWARD has planted safety there  Pure minister of light his heavenly care  Has purg'd the damp of Death from that polluted air  His Care exulting BRITAIN found  Here first display'd not here confin'd  No single tract of earth could bound  The active virtues of his mind  To all the lands where'er the tear  That mourn'd the Prisoner's wrongs severe  Sad Pity's glist'ning cheek impearl'd  Eager he steer'd with every sail unfurl'd  A friend to every clime a Patriot of the World  Ye nations thro' whose fair domain  Our flying sons of joy have past  By Pleasure driven with loosen'd rein  Astonish'd that they flew so fast  How did the heartimproving sight  Awake your wonder and delight  When in her unexampled chace  Philanthropy outstript keen Pleasure's pace  When with a warmer soul she ran a nobler race  Wheree'er her generous Briton went  Princes his supplicants became  He seem'd the enquiring angel sent  To scrutinize their secret shame  I am credibly informed that several Princes or at least persons in authothority requested Mr Howard not to publish a minute account of some prisons which reflected disgrace on their government  Captivity where he appear'd  Her languid head with transport rear'd  And gazing on her godlike guest  Like those of old whom Heaven's pure servant blest  E'en by his shadow seem'd of demons dispossest  Amaz'd her foreign children cry  Seeing their patron pass along  "O who is he whose daring eye  Can search into our hidden wrong  What monarch's Heavendirected mind  With royal bounty unconfin'd  Has tempted Freedom's son to share  These perils searching with an angel's care  Each cell of dire Disease each cavern of Despair"  No monarch's word nor lucre's lust  Nor vain ambition's restless fire  Nor ample power that sacred trust  His lifediffusing toils inspire  Rous'd by no voice save that whose cries  Internal bid the soul arise  From joys that only seem to bless  From low pursuits which little minds possess  To Nature's noblest aim the Succour of Distress  Taught by that God in Mercy's robe  Who his coelestial throne resign'd  To free the prison of the globe  From vice th' oppressor of the mind  For thee of misery's rights bereft  For thee Captivity he left  Fair Fortune's lap who far from coy  Bade him with smiles his golden hours employ  In her delicious bower the festive scene of joy  While to thy virtue's utmost scope  I boldly strive my aim to raise  As high as mortal hand may hope  To shoot the glittering shaft of Praise  PINDAR  Say HOWARD say what may the Muse  Whose melting eye thy merit views  What guerdon may her love design  What may she ask for thee from Power Divine  Above the rich rewards which are already thine  Sweet is the joy when Science flings  Her light on philosophic thought  When Genius with keen ardor springs  To clasp the lovely truth he sought  Sweet is the joy when Rapture's fire  Flows from the spirit of the lyre  When Liberty and Virtue roll  Springtides of fancy o'er the poet's soul  That wast his flying bark thro' seas above the pole  Sweet the delight when the gall'd heart  Feels Consolation's lenient hand  Bind up the wound from Fortune's dart  With Friendship's lifesupporting band  And sweeter still and far above  These fainter joys when purest Love  The soul his willing captive keeps  When he in bliss the melting spirit steeps  Who drops delicious tears and wonders that he weeps  But not the brightest joy which Arts  In floods of mental light bestow  Nor what firm Friendship's zeal imparts  Blest antidote of bitterest woe  Nor those that Love's sweet hours dispense  Can equal the ecstatic sense  When swelling to a fond excess  The grateful praises of reliev'd distress  Reechoed thro' the heart the soul of Bounty bless  These transports in no common state  Supremely pure sublimely strong  Above the reach of envious fate  Blest HOWARD these to thee belong  While years encreasing o'er thee roll  Long may this sunshine of the soul  New vigor to thy frame convey  Its radiance thro' thy noon of life display  And with serenest light adorn thy closing day  And when the Power who joys to save  Proclaims the guilt of earth forgiven  And calls the prisoners of the grave  To all the liberty of Heaven  In that bright day whose wonders blind  The eye of the astonish'd mind  When life's glad angel shall resume  His ancient sway announce to Death his doom  And from existence drive that tyrant of the tomb  In that blest hour when Seraphs sing  The triumphs gain'd in human strife  And to their new associates bring  The wreaths of everlasting life  May'st thou in Glory's hallow'd blaze  Approach the Eternal Fount of Praise  With those who lead the angelic van  Those pure adherents to their Saviour's plan  Who liv'd but to relieve the Miseries of Man  FINIS
