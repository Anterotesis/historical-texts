 ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC  AN ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC ON The Treatment which the EDITOR of the HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON has met with from certain Booksellers and Printers in Dublin INCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON Mr FAULKNER'S Defence of Himself Published in his Irish Newspaper of Nov  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCLIV  To the PUBLIC  MR Faulkner of Dublin having in the NewsPaper which bears his name of November published a sort of Defence of his own conduct in the transaction that passed between him and the Editor of the HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON in which he insinuates that what was done by him and some of his Brethren in trade in Dublin was in pursuance of a custom long established among the Dublin Booksellers And having also written Letters to several persons of character in London endeavouring to justify himself without having that strict regard to veracity in them which particularly becomes a man of business yet intrepidly desiring that these Letters might be shewn to Mr Richardson And lastly having joined with his Brethren to shut the Dublin Presses against his just complaints of the treatment he has met with from some of them Mr Richardson thinks he shall be excused for taking this opportunity to lay before the Publick an account of the whole transaction and the rather as the Invaders of his property have done their utmost to make a NATIONAL CAUSE of the measure they compelled him to take and as he presumes to think that the CAUSE OF LITERATURE in general is affected by their usage of him  He will begin with transcribing Mr Faulkner's Defence of himself  Mr Faulkner's Defence Dublin  Nov  George Faulkner of Dublin Printer and Bookseller having contracted some time ago with Mr Samuel Richardson of London for a Work intitled The History of Sir Charles Grandison which Mr Richardson was to send to Ireland before publication in London Accordingly Mr Richardson sent over four Sheets of the first Volume which Mr Faulkner received the third day of last August and posted up a Title that day which is a common  to give notice that they have put a Work or Works to the Press with design to publish with all convenient speed and thought that no other person in the kingdom had any part of that History but to his great surprize there were three other Titles posted up immediately after his by three different Booksellers who shewed twelve sheets of this Work in the same Edition and almost the first Volume complete in a larger letter and paper  Genuine History of the Transaction  Mr Faulkner knew though he does not here say he did how the three Booksellers came at the Sheets In his Letter dated Dublin Aug he sent Mr Richardson the first news of the invasion of his property  "I am very sorry" says he "for the illtreatment and the disappointment that you and I have met with in the History of Sir Charles Grandison four sheets of which Work I received by the last Post But to my great surprize I find FOUR other  more of the same Work in Octavo and Duodecimo which they have shewn me and left with me to compare"  He then gives proof of the iniquity as it came out on his examination of the sheets  "These circumstances" proceeds he "will I hope convince you of the truth of what I have asserted" He had before given cautions to Mr R against the attempts of his Brethren the Dublin Booksellers upon the morality of his men "and of the villainy and fraud of your Journeymen who have  robbed you  and  injured me  For which reasons it will be troublesome and unnecessary for you to send me any more of this Work as the persons who have printed the inclosed Titles with ANOTHER Bookseller claim the sole property of this Work And if I can prevail upon them to give me a share it will be only a fifth part"  Might not a man with whom he was in treaty and who had given him as will be seen an  undeserved  preference have expected advice and offers of assistance from him on this base attempt the rather as he seemed very sensible for his  own  sake of the injury done Mr R instead of endeavouring to  prevail  on such a Confederacy to admit him into a share with them in a Copy so vilely obtained And this without consulting Mr R or proposing to him to acquit him of his engagements to him At that time the corruptors of the honesty of Mr R's servants had made no progress in the Work And Mr F knew that Mr R was in the way of sending him sheets by every Post and intending to publish but two Volumes at a time that Mr F would have the sheets early enough to answer the intentions and the engagements of both  Three  of the four persons are named in the Titlepages he included in his Letter WILSON EXSHAW SAUNDERS But Mr Faulkner for reasons best known to himself has not to this hour named the  Fourth  who is believed to be a Bookseller in Dublin who served his apprenticeship with him  Mr Richardson in his Answer to this Letter dated Aug gave Mr Faulkner great opportunities to recollect himself After complaining of this cruel treatment he informs him  'That he had put a stop to the printing of the Work and that he would appeal to the World upon it'  He desires  'that he would not mention the corrections in the sheets he had sent him over tho' matter of nicety rather than necessity supposing it possible' as  it has proved 'that men who could act as these Confederates had acted would be capable of advertising the pirated edition as preferable to the genuine'  In order to put Mr Faulkner upon offering him his assistance in such way as he thought best though forbidden by him to send him any more sheets he desired to know if he was to conclude that all dealings between them were absolutely at an end He the rather put this to Mr Faulkner as he before he made his court to the Confederates had bespoke twentyfive sets in Octavo of which Mr R never after heard one word though they did not propose to propagate their piracy in that size No doubt he thought that sets in Octavo sold by him for Mr R might be a deduction of as many from the sale of his and his new partners Edition in DuodecimoSo wholly was he in an instant detached from Mr R and attached to them and his and their common interest  Mr Faulkner in his Reply dated the th and th of August acquaints Mr R that the  three  Booksellers had got the First and Second Volumes complete in both Editions Wilson the Octavo Exshaw and Saunders the Other and that each of them had laid himself out to get the Work as soon as they saw by the Advertisements in the London Papers that it would be published the following winter An Advertisement put into those Papers that the World might not take another Book of a Sir Charles Goodville in a Series of Letters for that expected from Mr R  Mr Faulkner declares in this Letter that the liberty taken by Wilson of advertising his intended Edition London Printed for S Richardson Dublin Reprinted  for  Peter Wilson in Damestreet to be printed for Mr Richardson was a licence  never before taken  in Dublin unless the Work were printed for the Author's benefit He advises Mr Richardson against sending over any of his Books to Ireland and to write to the Invaders the Corruptors to induce them to pay him their shares of the Seventy Guineas stipulated by him to be paid had he had the whole to himself declaring his willingness to pay his quota for the share they would allow him to have  "I am sorry to tell you" proceeds he in this Letter "that when  these People  produced their sheets and  obliged  me" Mean man to shew mine that I was  compelled  to give them up in order to obtain a share with them"  His very words  This step besides the advantage they afterwards on publishing their pirated Edition took of it as Mr R had foreseen to recommend that Edition secured Mr Faulkner of their side By it he absolutely gave up Mr Richardson and no doubt it spirited them to proceed as they then had reason to look upon him as their own and had no diversion to apprehend from him in Mr R's favour  "Your sending me more sheets" continued he "will be uselessI should be sorry your dealings and mine should be at an  end as I have the highest honour and regard for you for your many virtues and integrity"  But these were only words He offered not to Mr Richardson any service any assistance He knew that he and his Confederates should be able to secure in their interest the Dublin Presses He had discouraged the sending over any of the genuine Edition and thought it right to conclude with repeating his advice that Mr Richardson would meanly court the Corruptors as he had done intimating his desire to have a copy of what he thought fit to write to them lest his new Confederates should not have confidence enough in him to shew him what he supposed Mr R would write  In Mr Richardson's Answer to this Letter dated Aug he tells Mr Faulkner  'That he never could consent to propose terms to men who had bribed his servants to rob him and who were in possession of the stolen goods And cautions him to confider how far his own honour was concerned in the engagements he had entered into with them'  But let us see what he further says in his printed Defence  Upon which  says he  as they produced so much of the Copy they viz  Mr Faulkner and the Confederates  agreed according to an established invariable and constant custom among the Booksellers of Dublin that whoever gets any Books or Pamphlets or any part of them by the same Post shall or may join together if they think proper  Will Mr Faulkner say that it is an  established invariable constant  custom among the Booksellers of Dublin to renounce their agreements with men they had contracted with on their being notoriously robbed and to join with the Corruptors to supplicate a share with them in the plunder How wickedly does he slubber over this part of his conduct to the justification as may be said of that of his new ConfederatesCan such a man as this be too severely if justly dealt withSurely no He cannot expect that we should longer let sleep an affair that till now in tenderness to him he has never been reminded of and must believe had been entirely forgotten But first we will transcribe a paragraph which will shew the sense he affected to have then of the fraudulent means by which the Corruptors obtained the power they had of injuring Mr R  "You must have more rogues in your house than one" says he "as your two Editions have been sent to different people If I could find out" proceeds he "any of  my  Journeymen that would serve  me  in the same  villainous manner  I would immediately discharge them in the most infamous manner and publish their  crimes  in the most public manner in all the Papers which I am told by a very old French Journeyman Printer is a constant  practice in Germany France Holland and Switzerland and that care is taken to send those advertisements to all the Printingoffices in those countries to  prevent Masters from being imposed on  And I am further told that Journeymen and Apprentices will not converse or suffer  these nefarious Villains  to be interred in the earth but kick their dead carcases from place to place as they would dead  cats  or  dogs rats  or  mice  Perhaps" adds he "I have been too warm in my resentment against  such bad men  But as I have been much injured by them I hope you will excuse any rash words in this Letter when I do assure you that I am for your many virtues genius generosity and abilities your most obedient  When this flaming paragraph was  in terrorem  read in Mr Richardson's Printingoffice to his Workmen Killingbeck a suspected man who afterwards gave too much cause for the suspicion and who had been a journeyman for several years to Mr Faulkner in Dublin declared that notwithstanding this  occasional  vehemence of Mr Faulkner he had hardly in all the time he was with him composed from any other copy but first proofs revises c clandestinely obtained from England  c"  In this very Letter it was that Mr Faulkner declared his intentions to endeavour to  prevail  upon the Corruptors of  those nefarious villains  as he justly calls them to allow him a fourth or a fifth share in their  snacks  It is Machiavellian policy to love the treason and hate the traitor The dead carcases of the corrupted Journeymen are to be kicked about the streets it seems while the living Corruptors are to be supported and united with according to an  established invariable  and  constant  custom of the Booksellers of DublinWill Mr Faulkner assert this  We now come to the transaction which we suppose Mr Faulkner had forgot having never been reminded of itThe information of which was given to Mr Richardson in a Letter written to him from Dublin dated Nov by an English Printer of character and integrity then there  "I was yesterday" says he "in company with some Printers that I knew in London Among other things in conversation they familiarly commended Mr Faulkner's  great diligence  in London and after naming several pieces of which he had procured early copies I understood he had been furnished with the Third and Fourth Volumes of  Pamela  sheet by sheet as far as is done from your Press and is printing them off here with all speedThe truth of this information" adds he "may be depended upon"  Mr Faulkner actually printed these Two Volumes for his own entire benefit the copy so surreptitiously obtained  In Mr Richardson's Case he very tenderly mentioned this injury not naming Mr Faulkner It may be wondered that after this flagrant instance of Mr Faulkner's  diligence  as his then Journeymen chose to call it Mr R had dealings with him for his CLARISSAA very valuable man in business Mr Woodward who had a good opinion of Mr Faulkner prevailed upon him to prefer him to any other and undertook for his integrity Yet Mr Richardson was forced to appeal to this Mr Woodward afterwards for the recovering Thirty Guineas out of Seventy the consideration contracted for with Mr Faulkner on the preference given him in sending to him the sheets of his CLARISSA as they were printed and upon whose judgment but not without proofs given from his own Letters which he must have supposed were not regularly kept by Mr Richardson Mr Faulkner paid the unjustlydetained sum  of  which see more p But we will further attend to his printed state of the present case  The Post following Mr Faulkner got eight sheets more and the Booksellers shewed him two Volumes and said they expected more there being five Volumes of that History already printed Upon which Mr Faulkner wrote to Mr Richardson not to send him any more of that Work as it would be useless to him But that Mr Richardson should be no sufferer by any part that Faulkner should have in this Work as he would pay him for a fourth or fifth or any share he should have in it  Mr Faulkner staid not for this Post as is evident from the very Letter to Mr R in which he gives him the intelligence of the injury done him He tells Mr Richardson in it that he received his first four sheets on the d of August On the th the very next day such was his haste to join with the Corruptors he forbid as abovementioned Mr Richardson to send him any more sheets and signified his resolution to endeavour to prevail on the Associates to admit him into their partnership for a fourth or fifth share But then indeed he was so gracious as to intimate that he would pay Mr Richardson his proportion of the guineas according to the share the Pirates would allow him to hold with them which for a fifth would have been guineas  As to what he says of there being four or five Volumes printed before Mr Richardson sent him any sheets that was not so Not more than two were completed Three Volumes more indeed were composing by different hands in his house but they went on at convenience Mr Richardson as Mr Faulkner knew only intending to publish two at a time though the Pirates afterwards obliged him to alter his measures  and in two or three Letters following  proceeds Mr Faulkner  he told Mr Richardson that notwithstanding his neglect and delay in not sending  him the sheets directly from the Press which he ought to have done and not have stayed for the finishing of five or six Volumes it might have prevented what hath happened to all parties and hindered the reprinting of any other Edition but that designed by the Author for Mr Faulkner  In two or three Letters following  says he How slightly is this mentioned by Mr Faulkner He had been parading to Mr Richardson from his Letter dated  Aug to the th of Septem+ber sometimes pretending to de+test the part his new partners acted sometimes seeming to have it in view to procure Mr Richardson redress at other times to intimidate him into their measures All which made it necessary for Mr R either to submit to the injury or to endeavour to lighten the weight of it by anticipating them  What he says of the delay in sending the sheets directly from the Press as he pronounces Mr Richardson ought to have done will be further taken notice of in another place  See p    yet Mr Richardson might draw upon him for any Sum not exceeding the contract and he would pay it  This offer was not made till in his Letter of Sept and at the persuasion of two of Mr R's friends for the sake of his own character and then it was thus ungracefully expressed in that Letter  "However notwithstanding their his partners illtreatment of you  and particularly of me    which he resented by joining with them  you may draw upon me at discretion for any sum you think proper UNDER the sum stipulated between you and me AS I know you to be a man of probity honour and conscience"  He had told Mr Richardson in a former Letter that he knew he would not suffer him to be  out  of pocket  He adds  "I blush for my Brethren" But why so if they have done nothing but what he could conscientiously have joined them in according to the  established invariable constant  custom of the Booksellers in Dublin "But let them" proceeds he "answer for it at the  great day of account  I  know  that you have been  much  and  most injuriously villainously  and  unprecedentedly  treated by your more than hellish wicked and CORRUPTED servants"  By whom corrupted Let him answer Might he not as well have named his new partners  and further that if Mr Richardson would acquit him of the contract  Mr Faulkner knows that Mr Richardson never once hinted holding him to it The sum stipulated for was to be paid for sending him the sheets before publication and the contract was virtually at an end when after receiving the first parcel he forbad Mr Richardson sending any more to him Nor could Mr Faulkner think himself under any when in the same Letter in  which he gave notice of the invasion he prohibited sending him any more of the sheets and declared himself with as much sedateness as if it were a thing of course determined to attach himself to the Corruptors His offer afterwards to pay a sum under that stipulated for was that he and his new partners might go on unmolestedly in reaping the fruits of their baseness Nor is it improbable that their refusal to consent to pay their parts was owing to their view of intimidating Mr Richardson by means of their new partner to give a sanction to it which Mr R had refused to do in which case Mr Faulkner who has so happy a talent of displaying his merits would hardly have found himself a sufferer when he and his confederates had come to divide the spoil  or desire him to withdraw from his partnership with the Booksellers he would do it  Strange man He never hinted to Mr Richardson that  his  desire of this would determine him Indeed in his Letter of September he says by way of postscript  "I would be glad to exonerate myself from  this set of men  and will do it if possible at all events"  But for a considerable time after this he continued their willing partner and made a merit to his other partners in the piracy of refusing to Mr Richardson the common civility of his Newspaper to do himself reasonable justice Well did he know Mr Richardson's mind as to his adhering to his engagement with his new partners for thus Mr Richardson wrote to him in his Letter dated Aug  "You Sir will best judge whether your own honour will not be sullied by a concern with so vile a confederacy What can a fourth or fifth share in a Work so treacherously obtained do for any one And if they proceed I shall be obliged to make use of the names of all the Proprietors in the Dublin Edition that I can come at"  But  proceeds he  Mr Richardson delayed answering these Letters for some time However Mr Faulkner before he got Mr Richardson's last Letter declined all partnership in that Work and hath not nor will have any share whatever in the reprinting of it nor did he nor doth he know in what manner that work is carrying on having never seen a single sheet or even a page of the Irish Edition the truth of all which Mr Faulkner is ready to  attest in the most solemn manner  Mr Faulkner had in his hands at this time Mr Richardson's reasons for this delay not at all to his advantage  It was then nothing to Mr R whether Mr Faulkner held or quitted He set his face and indeed his whole strength against the genuine Edition though he knew that if he had given the assistance he ought to have given to one whom he repeatedly allowed to be an injured and innocent man  it had never been sent over to Ireland  It is poor to say  "that he knew not in what manner the Work was then carried on having never seen a single sheet or even a page of the Irish Edition"  when he had told Mr Richardson that it was printing page for page with the genuine one and when he had partners who wanted not his direction nor any thing of him but that he would countenance them and by separating himself from the man with whom he had contracted deprive him of the assistance he could have given him Mr Richardson would perhaps think himself very cruel were he to put the poor man upon the solemn attestation he offers to make But why it may be asked did he divest himself of a share which he had so meanly crept to the Confederates to obtain if he and they had agreed to join together in pursuance of an  established invariable constant custom among the Booksellers of Dublin  And another question we put to the Publishers of the Irish Edition Why if they have kept within this custom have they published it without affixing their names to it or any names but ascribed to the Booksellers of Dublin in general a publication of which they themselves seem to be ashamed  So much for Mr Faulkner's defence of his conduct as printed in the Paper which bears his name  As it has been said that the cause of Literature and of Authors in general is concerned in this transaction we will further intrude by way of narrative on the Reader's patience  Mr Richardson in his Letter of Aug in which he declared that he could not follow Mr Faulkner's advice to sue to the Corruptors of his Workmens honesty to obtain a poor consideration for the injury done him and in which he had cautioned him of the dishonour that might accrue to him Mr Faulkner by joining with them thus writes  "I am very earnest that you will yourselflet these men know my resentments resolutions c If they have any regard to justice if they have any compassion for or men of my house who may be suspected and to one absolutely discharged I think I might rather expect satisfaction from  them  than  they  proposals from  me  It is a very great grievance for a man who uses all his Workmen well to be obliged to go on furnishing work and money for bosomtraitors and not to know how to help himself"  Mr Faulkner's answer is dated Dublin Sept He will thank himself if the transcribeing it here gives him uneasiness  Dear Sir  "I had not your favour of the th past from Bath until Wednesday last when I immediately sent to Messieurs Wilson Exshaw and Saunders to give me a meeting but could not see any of them that day but Wilson to whom I told the contents of your Letters and the  religious  and  moral obligations  that  be  and  the  others  lay under to do you justice who had been so much injured in your property by the horrid roguery and villainy of your men  through  THEIR  unwarrantable scandalous  and  illegal means  " No custom of trade pleaded here "But the waved giving me an answer at that time although I pressed him very much thereto and then he said he would think of it and that I should hear from him the day following which I did not nor from either of the others Upon which I went to them all this day and found them at home but could get no positive answer from the first of them who still put me off to a meeting which we are to have next Saturday when I hope to be able to write a more satisfactory Letter to you than this After the conversation I had with Wilson I went to Exshaw and Saunders and spoke to them both in the same manner And their answer was That whatever Wilson would do they would be satisfied to come into the same terms But I am very much afraid that you will be a greater sufferer than what you or I could imagine as it hath been hinted to me that they are in treaty with some Scotch Booksellers to whom they are to send or  have sent  the sheets as also to get Grandison translated into French or to send the sheets to France before publication which will frustrate and injure you in both those kingdoms which I most sincerely wish that Heaven may avert  This most probably would have been carried into execution had not Mr Richardson disabled them from perfecting their copies by putting a stop to printing what remained of it unprinted at the time he was informed of the baseness  This wicked affair hath almost made me mad and blind with vexation and fretting to think that so innocent and worthy a Gentleman as you are should be treated by the most hellish servants and  wicked men  in the manner you have beenI think I am bound in honour and affection to you to give you all the intelligence in my power" Yet never named nor hinted at his  fourth  Bookseller whom he must know "And if I cannot prevail on THESE MEN  who have corrupted and bribed your Servants  to rob and betray you I shall endeavour to break off with them in their  wicked attempts  upon your property to convince you of my character and sincere good wishes to you and that I am your most faithful affectionate and most humble servant  George Faulkner  "They have now four Printinghouses on this Work and have printed above twenty sheets page for page with your Edition but I have not seen one proof or single sheet of THIS PIRACY"  Mr Richardson thus threatned to be attacked in more countries than one particularly in Scotland thought it was time to draw up a State of his Case and to lay it before the Public absolutely  hopeless of any satisfactory result from the meeting of these worthy men which was to be had seven days after the date of the above alarming Letter  The Case may be had gratis of Mr Main in Dublin and at Mr Richardson's in London by any Gentleman or Lady who hath curiosity to peruse it in which will be seen that Mr R treated Mr Faulkner with great tenderness He continued to do so as long as charity to him and justice to himself could be reconciled together This Case bears date Sept Mr R published it not till he had advice from a friend in Dublin that no good was to be expected from the meeting of the th and that the Associates were hurrying the pirated Edition to get it out by the meeting of the Irish Parliament which was before Mr R could possibly complete his    Mr Faulkner's next Letter gives the result of the meeting of his Associates and him as follows  Dublin  Sept  Dear Sir  "In my last I acquainted you that Messieurs Exshaw Wilson and Saunders and your humble Servant were to have a meeting this evening Which accordingly we had when your two friends" naming them "were present who perhaps may acquaint you of what passed in company and therefore I shall not trouble you with a recital which cannot possibly be agreeable to you when I tell you that Mr Exshaw said that he had all the sheets he produced after I had pasted up my Title  some weeks  nay even  months  before you sent me any part of Grandison and that he hath  all the sheets printed in your house  of the  Third  or  whatever more hath been done at your Press  AND THEREFORE  with the other Two  will not consent to give any copymoney  Mr Richardson had not commissioned Mr Faulkner to treat with these men for copymoney If he could have punished them as receivers of stolen goods by the laws of their own country that as Mr Faulkner knew would have been his choice But it is evident that Mr F  imagined  this would satisfy him and  as  evident that these three men were determined to refuse even the paltry satisfaction of guineas a man had such terms been proposed to them for the property of Seven Volumes to be sold in Ireland and honest Mr Exshaw gave the reason to which the other Two assentedBecause they were already possessed of the Work by the villainy of corrupted servants  However"And then he makes the ungraceful offer mentioned p II And then also he takes upon himself to blush for his Brethren and refers them to answer for it at the great day of account "I know" proceeds he "that you have been much and most injuriously villainously and  unprecedentedly  treated by your more than hellish wicked and corrupted servantsBut be assured that you will meet with a man who would be glad to imitate you in your generosity and virtues And that is your muchobliged most affectionate and sincere friend as well as humble servant  George Faulkner  October Mr Faulkner writes to Mr Richardson expressing his surprize that he had not an answer to his of the th past wishes in it that Mr R had taken more time to consider his Case before he published it and blames him for the delay in sending him the sheets to which he ascribes the cause of all that had happened from the Pirates He refers himself to a Letter written to Mr R in his favour by a worthy friend of Mr R who had been induced to think well of him from his offers of making an affidavit to prove upon the Confederates their being in possession of the stolen goods and to remit to Mr R the whole sum stipulated for between them at first  The Gentleman  did  write a warm Letter in Mr F's behalf Mr Richardson laid before him in answer the state of the Case from the Letters that had passed between Mr Faulkner and him The Gentleman then put the sincerity of Mr F's offered services to the test and was soon convinced that Mr R had nothing to expect from him Mr Richardson has not asked the Gentleman's leave to give particulars Mr Faulkner about the same time appealed to several Gentlemen of character in London as an innocent man and even desired them to shew what he had written to them to Mr Richardson These several circumstances engaged the latter to write a long Letter to him dated the th and th of October recapitulating the above factsWhence the following extracts  We wish Mr Faulkner would publish the whole Letter and every Letter at length that hath passed between him and Mr R on this subject    Sir  "You express yourself surprised that I answered not your two last Letters One of them kept me in some little suspense about the result of the meeting you was to have with the three men who have used me so cruelly To the other what could I say I had no heart to write to you When I considered the whole tenor of your conduct in the affair before usWhen I recollected the attempt you made to underpay me guineas out of stipulated for in the affair of  Clarissa  Your perseverance in so wicked a partnership which you was so little as to creep to them for on their own infamous termsYour magnificent pretensions to honour in every LetterDoes it become the character of a man valuing himself for sincerity and plaindealing thought I to let Mr Faulkner imagine me such a poor creature either in spirit or understanding as to be blinded by his selfdeceptionWas not my chief dependence on the conditions I made with him  That the sale of the Dublin Edition should be confined to Ireland and that that Edition should not be published till I gave leave and by Two Volumes at a time  Have I either of these conditions secured to me Did he stipulate with them for me  one  favourable condition  on his admission among them Have they not refused terms which he though without my desire proposed to them and set me at absolute defiance Did he not deliver them up sheets I had sent him to obtain an admission with them into so infamous a partnership Did I not caution him that his honour might suffer by this and that I should be obliged to name to the Public every Partner in this base proceeding Yet  did  he not  does  he not to this hour continue his partnership with them to the depriving me of all manner of assistance that he might have afforded me and to the obliging me to throw myself into other hands in order to disappoint the Confederates of the immoral gains they proposed to themselves And shall I forbear for the sake of  the whole Republic of Letters  affected by so base a proceeding endeavouring to make an example of these men instead of meanly compromising with them and giving a  sanction  to so vile a corruptionThese my reflexions what unwillingness must I have to answer your Letter Your offer though very ungraciously made me of the whole sum to one of my friends of any thing UNDER the sum to  me  might appear to you a magnificent one But Sir you know me not Could you have told me that you had been a loser by  Clarissa  I should have contrived some way in our future dealings to reimburse you And to accept of the whole sum from a fourth or fifth Sharer in profits that were to arise from an abuse of me or  any  sumI could not do it Yet was it an ungrateful thing to me to be obliged to speak out but this for your sake more than my own This made me loth to sit down to answer your Letter yet in mine to one of my worthy friends I told him that you were very safe in making that offer to me  "  I have seen  say you  your Case and what you have said of me  I designed you should And have I said one word but what you have said yourself of the part you have acted by me Dear Sir what selfpartiality must you have to write to me as you have written of your own honour in every Letter and so to set off the part you have acted in this transaction as could induce one of the worthiest men in Ireland to write so warmly in your justification I write rather with an expostulatory spirit than an angry one Take advice of your own heart and I shall have a test of the goodness of that heart or otherwise as it acquits or condemns you Have you never been told dear Sir that you have too much paradeIndeed you seem to be lost in the dust you raise about yourself by it  "  Had I sent you the sheets from the Press as wrought  So it is my own fault that I am thus basely invaded But it becomes my character to tell you frankly that I balanced in my mind whether I should deal with you at all tho' I offered not to engage  with any other The hint I have given of your treatment of me in  Clarissa  was the occasion of my balancing But as you had seemed to approve what you had seen of the piece when last in London and had expectation of it I was loth to disappoint youAnd as I was resolved to publish but two Volumes at a time as I told you I pleased myself that you would have full time to print them as I proceeded Little did I think myself with such precautions as I had taken unsafe for I knew not that there were in Dublin such men as those to whom you joined yourself And is it not a grievous hardship upon the London Printers to find that Mr Faulkner seems to think that copies of their property are much more secure in the hands of Dublin Booksellers and Printers than in their own before publication"  "Indeed Sir you might have been of service to me of service to yourself and done honour to your name your trade your country all affronted by this base proceeding The fair path was before you Why would you by joining yourself with these men in an action which you justly call  scandalous wicked unprecedented  give a sanction to the  nefarious  proceeding Why persevere in it and by so doing deprive of all assistance all redress by your means the man of whose justice you had no doubt who was in treaty with you who confided in you  You blush for your Brethren  you say in a former LetterAh my dear Sir forgive me for saying that often and often have I blushed for you from the beginning of August last"  Mr Richardson then quotes to Mr Faulkner passages from several Letters that passed between them to demonstrate that his charge of delay had no foundation to support it and then subjoins as follows  "You see Sir by the dates for your notice of the theft is dated Aug that from July when your acceptance is dated no time was lost in sending you the sheets I have told you the reason for which you may thank yourself why I entered not into treaty with you before I had no doubt of the sheets such injunctions given being safe in my own house You could have no reason to expect them from me  before  we entered into engagements which as above was not till in consequence of your Letter of July which must be some days in coming to my hands Whence then the reason of your outcry for my delay of sending the sheets Whence your expectation that I wouldO Mr Faulkner take care of truth in any thing you shall publish or write in an affair in which you have acted so strange a part You are in the condition of a limed bird the more you struggle the more you will entangle yourself How have you slubbered over to a worthy Gentleman in London  the affair of your relinquishing me of joining with the men whose baseness you so  justly decried  and your poor offer to me of or pounds or such a sum for giving a sanction to the robbery of myself and the corrupting of my servants For is not that the light in which you ought to have looked upon your proposal to me And in which your late your  too late  offer was also to be taken An offer not made till in your Letter of the th of September the worse than piracy hurrying on at four Presses the consequence of which was to skreen them and to justify your usage of me  "There are other misrepresentations in your Letter to the Gentleman you wanted to prepossess in your favourHow could you say that he might depend upon what you write to him as truthBut indeed that is of a piece with your assertion that I in my Case" In which you was used with an undeserved tenderness "have not truly represented your part in the transaction I am amazed at you And yet my compassion for you is greater than my indignation  "This altercation is a painful task upon me and more in the part I am forced upon with you than with the others Why once more I ask would you join yourself with men you call  wicked  in an action you own to be  unprecedentedly vile  Why as I warned you as I told you what steps I would take did you not when you saw your error wash your hands of them and rather declare yourself mistaken than seek to bribe me to give a sanction to so vile a depredationBut I shall repeat what I have written before I saw this Letter this strange this inconsistent this misrepresenting Letter of yours to Mr ******* I wish if you have a copy of it you would revise it and compare it with what I have written from facts warranted by your own Letters and mineWould to heaven you had left me room to clear up and justify your conduct in this transaction But after such a Letter as this to Mr ******* what can I think  of  what can I say  for  Mr Faulkner but thisThat he has given a proof that it must be an ingenuous mind only that having made a false step will choose to own the fault as the best method of extricating itself  "The World Sir will not in more favourable Cases to character than this judge of us as we would have it Guard against selfdelusion You are more in danger from it than any man I know if I take my opinion of you from what has passed between you and me from our concerns in  Clarissa  to this moment and all the time from your uncalledfor parade of honour in every Letter Think me as you  will  if you do me justice and that from the very freedom of my expostulation your wellwisher and humble servant  S Richardson  London    October    We take leave to observe that Mr Faulkner had in his hands the Letter from which the above extracts are made when he printed in his own paper the paragraph which he designed to pass for a justification of himself the truth of every part of which he offers to attest in the most solemn manner  But  possibly  Mr Faulkner had not received that Letter when he wrote the following  Dublin  Oct    Dear Sir  "Notwithstanding you have not been pleased to answer any of my three last Letters yet I think proper to acquaint you that I have broke off all partnership with the  three  Booksellers" The  fourth  still secreted "who so  wickedly  and  injuriously  treated you and  me  in the History of Sir Charles Grandison and that I have not nor shall have any part or share whatever in the  pirated Edition  the copy of which was so BASELY and FRAUDULENTLY obtained This I was determined upon  from the beginning  and only  waited for your positive commands  " What a man is this "to concur with me in these sentiments If you print another case or publish any advertisement relative to this affair I make no doubt but you will do justice to the much injured altho' very much your most obedient and most humble servant  George Faulkner  After this Letter could it be credited had it not been published by himself that he was the Author of the paragraph of November before animadverted upon by which he would make the world believe that in joining with the Undertakers of this pirated Edition he and they had done no more than was warranted by the  established invariable constant  customs of the Dublin Booksellers  In a Letter written by one of Mr Richardson's friends dated Dublin October intimation was given him that the Associates proposed to surrender up all they had printed which they gave in as near Two Volumes only at prime cost amounting to somewhat above pounds Mr Richardson wrote back his willingness to be the purchaser but some new chicane seemed to be designed by this overture for in a fortnight or three weeks after they were ready to publish Six Volumes  They accordingly published them but as hath been observed without putting any Booksellers names to the Titles and tho' the genuine edition was put at the price such books are generally sold for in Ireland they as Mr Faulkner had foretold undersold the Edition of the lawful Proprietor  Mr Richardson will not were it true report that the saving of Two Shillings in the purchase of  Six  Volumes the price of which cannot be found fault with will be a sufficient reason with the Gentlemen and Ladies of Ireland to prefer the  "pirated Edition the copy of which to borrow Mr Faulkner's words in his  Letter of Oct was so  basely  and  fraudulently  obtained"  But he has been heard to take comfort in the following passage transcribed from the Letter of a friend to him  "What I fear is that the high merit of the Work will procure the Pirates more customers than I wish But as it is inimitably well calculated to do good the injury done you will certainly afford me one satisfaction and a great one that the excellent Performance will be more universally read for the bustle that hath been made about it Who knows dear Sir but the glorious Sir CHARLES may teach some honesty and dignity of soul even to him who buys it as stolen goods a few shillings lower from the Pirates than he could from you"  The secreting the name of the Fourth Bookseller has been often mentioned above Mr Richardson wrote to one of his friends in Ireland his suspicions as to the person grounded on facts that had been communicated to him by another friend residing in Dublin This produced the following passage in the answer of the Gentleman dated October  "From what you say of a  fourth  person not named either to you or to your friends here I guess it was that very person who corrupted your servants and furnished the three Booksellers named with the sheets These three name themselves in the Titlepages they at first posted up because perhaps no corruption can be  proved  on them but conceal the fourth Associate lest he should be prosecuted If this is the case and nothing can be more probable for Wilson hath by affidavit before the Lord Mayor purged himself of the  corruption  and Exshaw and Saunders declare they can do the same then Mr ******** is still more evidently the scandalous Associate of the Corruptors inasmuch as he conceals the most criminal and in some measure abets the rest"  Be this as it may these  three  men cannot clear themselves of the piracy founded on that corruption and of the parts they acted and proposed further to act in extending the injury to France and Scotland as charged in Mr Faulkner's Letters of Sept and beforecited  The Pirates have endeavoured to make a National cause of the transaction But is not the Nationality of these men a cover for the basest Selfishness Are Messieurs Exshaw Wilson Saunders and the fourth concealed person and Mr Faulkner joined with them the Irish nation  Mr Faulkner in one of his Letters to Mr Richardson suspecting Mr Main would be employed by him though then Mr R had not mentioned him nor even thought of him stigmatizes him  as a Scotish agent  But may we not ask What are these Booksellers of Dublin that they think themselves intitled to prey upon the property of every other man in every nation round them yet  join to hunt down any other subject of the same Prince if he attempt to get bread among or near them  Mr Richardson has been accused in an Irish public Paper of having formerly engaged with a Mr Bacon of Dublin in a scheme which the Author of that Paper says was likely to be very detrimental to the Printers and Booksellers of Dublin in general  This was the fact Mr Bacon an ingenious man now in orders an Irishman or one who had always had his connexions with that kingdom and professed a love even to partiality for it kept a coffeehouse of note and credit in Dublin at which were frequently held auctions for books and merchandize He had been concerned with the Press as a Corrector and proposed to set up a public Paper there and to take up his freedom of the Company of Stationers in Dublin He did both The latter in the month of November The Paper was called  The Gazette  The Advertisements of the Public Offices were printed in it He set up entirely on the Irish footing and purposed to employ Irish Printers to buy his paper of Irish Stationers and to avail himself as other Irish Printers and Booksellers made it their endeavour to do of such copies of books published in London as he could procure early and  fairly by consent of the Proprietors  Crime enough in that perhaps for Mr Faulkner at contracting with Mr Richardson was desirous that his Dublin Brethren should not know that he gave  any  consideration for the liberty of reprinting  The History of Sir Charles Grandison  Mr Bacon was an absolute stranger to Mr Richardson brought to him by Mr Thomas Osborne of Gray'sinn and Mr Richardson then knowing not any other Irish Bookseller or Printer and being about to publish his Third and Fourth Volumes of  Pamela  was induced to enter into agreement with him and to furnish him with the sheets as they came from his Press  in order to his reprinting them in Dublin  The sheets were accordingly sent him over But Mr Faulkner as is beforementioned p having by his extraordinary  diligence  clandestinely got at the sheets as printed at Mr Richardson's he Mr Bacon was deprived of the intended benefit and also forestalled in the sale of the genuine Edition of which were sent him in resentment of such base treatment  Tho' Mr Bacon's prospects were at that time very favourable and tho' he wanted not any other sort of  diligence  but that for which some of his Brethren have made themselves famous yet Mr Richardson's concern with him to Mr Bacon's great regret held but one year And his furnishing Mr Bacon with the sheets of  Pamela  Vol III IV  to be reprinted in Ireland  his engagement some years afterwards to send over to Mr Faulkner the sheets of  Clarissa for the same purpose  notwithstanding his treatment of him  in  Pamela  and those of his  Grandison  now lately notwithstanding his treatment of him in  Clarissa  evidently demonstrate that he had no intention to interfere with the Booksellers and Printers of Dublin by sending over his books ready printed till the atrocious injury he received and the determined perseverance of the Injurers made him think it adviseable to endeavour to anticipate Confederates who had so vilely by the corruption of his servants as hath been often said obtained the power of hurting him in a property  so absolutely his own  This further may be said That Mr R printed not a number with a view of sending any over to Ireland But such a one only as his friends thought rather short of answering the English demand and it has proved that all he sent over to Dublin would have been sold in England at a  better  price as Printing and Paper here are more costly than in Ireland tho' he had caused them to be sold in Dublin at the Irish price from the first  Mr R has been put to great expence by these men and to great trouble in the altercation with them But he is bringing himself to look upon their unprovoked treatment of him as a punishment for assuming the pen at the expence of his health and to the giving up every rational amusement when he had a business upon his hands which was enough to employ his whole attention and which as his  principal  care he never neglected  It has been more than once said that this Cause is the Cause of Literature in general and it may be added it is even  that  of the honest Booksellers and Printers of both Nations We therefore hope that our prolixity will be forgiven  We will take upon us to add that  every  man in Mr R's station has not the spirit the will the independence to hang out lights to his Cotemporaries to enable them to avoid Savages who hold themselves in readiness to plunder a vessel even before it becomes a wreck  London  Feb    FINIS
