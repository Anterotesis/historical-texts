ManMountain  AN ODE  By TITTY TITT  Esq  PoetLaureat to his Majesty of LILLIPUT  Translated into ENGLISH  I  _IN amaze  Lost I gaze  Can our Eyes  Reach thy Size  May my Lays  Swell with Praise  Worthy thee  Worthy me  Muse inspire  All thy Fire  Bards of old  Of him told  When they said  Atlas  Head  Propt the Skies  See and believe your Eyes  II  See him stride  Vallies wide  Over Woods  Over Floods  When he treads  Mountains Heads  Groan and shake  Armies quake  Lest his Spurn  Overturn  Man and Steed  Troops take heed  Left and Right  Speed your Flight  Lest an Host  Beneath his Foot be lost  III  Turn'd aside  From his Hide  Safe from Wound  Darts rebound  From his Nose  Clouds he blows  When he speaks  Thunder breaks  When he eats  Famine threats  When he drinks  Neptune  shrinks  Nigh thy Ear  In Mid Air  On thy Hand  Let me stand  So shall I  Lofty Poet touch the Sky  THE LAMENTATION Of  Glumdalclitch  for the Loss of  Grildrig  A PASTORAL  _SOON as  Glumdalclitch  mist her pleasing Care  She wept she blubber'd and she tore her Hair  No  British  Miss sincerer Grief has known  Her Squirrel missing or her Sparrow flown  She furl'd her Sampler and hawl'd in her Thread  And stuck her Needle into  Grildrig  's Bed  Then spread her Hands and with a Bounce let fall  Her Baby like the Giant in  Guildhall  In Peals of Thunder now she roars and now  She gently whimpers like a lowing Cow  Yet lovely in her Sorrow still appears  Her Locks dishevell'd and her Flood of Tears  Seem like the lofty Barn of some rich Swain  When from the Thatch drips fast a Shower of Rain  In v  n she search'd each Cranny of the House  Each gaping Chink impervious to a Mouse  " Was it for this she cry'd with daily Care  " Within thy reach I set the Vinegar  " And fill'd the Cruet with the acid Tide  " While PepperWaterWorms thy Bait supply'd  " Where twin'd the Silver Eel around thy Hook  " And all the little Monsters of the Brook  " Sure in that Lake he droptMy  Grilly  's drown'd  She dragg'd the Cruet but no  Grildrig  found  " Vain is thy Courage  Grilly  vain thy Boast  " But little Creatures enterprise the most  " Trembling I've seen thee dare the Kitten's Paw  " Nay mix with Children as they play'd at Taw  " Nor fear the Marbles as they bounding flew  " Marbles to them but rolling Rocks to you  " Why did I trust thee with that giddy Youth  " Who from a  Page  can ever learn the Truth  " Vers'd in Court Tricks that Moneyloving Boy  " To some Lord's Daughter sold the living Toy  " Or rent him Limb from Limb in cruel Play  " As Children tear the Wings of Flies away  " From Place to Place o'er  Brobdingnag  I'll roam  " And never will return or bring thee home  " But who hath Eyes to trace the passing Wind  " How then thy fairy Footsteps can I find  " Dost thou bewildred wander all alone  " In the green Thicket of a Mossy Stone  " Or tumbled from the Toadstool's slipp'ry Round  " Perhaps all maim'd lie groveling on the Ground  " Dost thou imbosom'd in the lovely Rose  " Or sunk within the Peach's Down repose  " Within the KingCup if thy Limbs are spread  " Or in the golden Cowslip's velvet Head  " O shew me  Flora  'midst those Sweets the Flower  " Where sleeps my  Grildrig  in the fragrant Bower▪  " But ah I fear thy little Fancy roves  " On little Females and on little Loves  " Thy pigmy Children and thy tiny Spouse  " The Baby Playthings that adorn thy House  " Doors Windows Chimneys and the spacious Rooms  " Equal in Size to Cells of Honeycombs  " Hast thou for these now ventur'd from the Shore  " Thy Bark a Beanshell and a Straw thy Oar  " Or in thy Box now bounding on the Main  " Shall I ne'er bear thy self and House again  " And shall I see thee on my Hand no more  " To see thee leap the Lines and traverse o'er  " My spacious Palm of Stature scarce a Span  " Mimick the Actions of a real Man  " No more behold thee turn my Watches Key  " As Seamen at a Capstern Anchors weigh  " How wert thou wont to walk with cautious Tread  " A Dish of Tea like MilkPale on thy Head  " How chase the Mite that bore thy Cheese away  " And keep the rolling Maggot at a Bay  She spoke but broken Accents stopt her Voice  Soft as the speaking Trumpets mellow Noise  She sob'd a Storm and wip'd her flowing Eyes  Which seem'd like two broad Suns in misty Skies  O squander not thy Grief those Tears command  To weep upon our Cod in  NewfoundLand  The plenteous Pickle shall preserve the Fish  And  Europe  taste thy Sorrows in her Dish  TO Mr  Lemuel Gulliver  The Grateful ADDRESS of the Unhappy HOUYHNHNMS now in Slavery and Bondage in  England  _TO thee we Wretches of the  Houhnhnm  Band  Condemn'd to labour in a barb'rous Land  Return our Thanks Accept our humble Lays  And let each grateful  Houyhnhnm  neigh thy Praise  O happy  Yahoo  purg'd from human Crimes  By thy sweet Sojourn in those virtuous Climes  Where reign our Sires There to thy Countrey's Shame  Reason you found and Virtue were the same  Their Precepts raz'd the Prejudice of Youth  And even a  Yahoo  learn'd the Love of Truth  Art thou the first who did the Coast explore  Did never  Yahoo  tread that Ground before  Yes Thousands But in Pity to their Kind  Or sway'd by Envy or through Pride of Mind  They hid their Knowledge of a nobler Race  Which own'd would all their Sires and Sons disgrace  You like the  Samian  visit Lands unknown  And by their wiser Morals mend your own  Thus  Orpheus  travell'd to reform his Kind  Came back and tam'd the Brutes he left behind  You went you saw you heard With Virtue fought  Then spread those Morals which the  Houyhnhnms  taught  Our Labours here must touch thy gen'rous Heart  To see us strain before the Coach and Cart  Compell'd to run each knavish Jockey's Heat  Subservient to  Newmarket  's annual Cheat  With what Reluctance do we Lawyers bear  To fleece their Countrey Clients twice a Year  Or manag'd in your Schools for Fops to ride  How foam how fret beneath a Load of Pride  Yes we are Slavesbut yet by Reason's Force  Have learnt to bear Misfortune like a Horse  O would the Stars to ease my Bonds ordain  That gentle  Gulliver  might guide my Rein  Safe would I bear him to his Journey's End  For 'tis a Pleasure to support a Friend  But if my Life be doom'd to serve the Bad  O may'st thou never want an easy Pad  MARY GƲLLIVER  TO Capt  Lemuel Gulliver  AN EPISTLE  The Captain some time after his Return being retir'd to Mr Sympson's in the Countrey Mrs Gulliver apprehending from his late Behaviour some Estrangement of his Affections writes him the following expostulating soothing and tenderlycomplaing EPISTLE  _WELCOME thrice welcome to thy native Place  What touch me not what  shun a wife's Embrace  Have I for this thy tedious Absence born  And wak'd and wish'd whole Nights for thy Return  In five long Years I took no second Spouse  What  Redriff  Wife so long hath kept her Vows  Your Eyes your Nose Inconstancy betray  Your Nose you stop your Eyes you turn away  'Tis said that thou shouldst  cleave unto thy Wife    Once  thou  didst cleave and  I  could cleave for Life  Hear and relent hark how thy Children moan  Be kind at least to these they are thy own  Behold and count them all secure to find  The honest Number that you left behind  See how they pat thee with their pretty Paws  Why start you are they Snakes or have they Claws  Thy Christian Seed our mutual Flesh and Bone  Be kind at least to these they are thy own  Biddel  like thee might farthest  India  rove  He chang'd his Countrey but retain'd his Love  There's Captain  Pannel  absent half his Life  Comes back and is the kinder to his Wife  Yet  Pannel  's Wife is brown compar'd to me  And Mistress  Biddel  sure is Fifty three  Not touch me never Neighbour call'd me Slut  Was  Flimnap  's Dame more sweet in  Lilliput  I've no red Hair to breath an odious Fume  At least thy Consort's cleaner than thy  Groom  Why then that dirty Stableboy thy Care  What mean those Visits to the  Sorrel Mare  Say by what Witchcraft or what Daemon led  Preferr'st thou  Litter  to the Marriage Bed  Some say the Dev'l himself is in that  Mare    If so our  Dean  shall drive him forth by Prayer  Some think you mad some think you are possest  That  Bedlam  and clean Straw would suit you best  Vain means alas this Frenzy to appease  That  Straw  that  Straw  would heighten the Disease  My Bed the Scene of all our former Joys  Witness two lovely Girls two lovely Boys  Alone I press in Dreams I call my Dear  I stretch my Hand no  Gulliver  is there  I wake I rise and shiv'ring with the Frost  Search all the House my  Gulliver  is lost  Forth in the Street I rush with frantick Cries  The Windows open all the Neighbours rise  Where sleeps my  Gulliver  O tell me where  The Neighbours answer "  With the Sorrel Mare  At early Morn I to the Market haste  Studious in ev'ry thing to please thy Taste  A curious  Fowl  and  Sparagrass  I chose  For I remember'd you were fond of those  Three Shillings cost the first the last sev'n Groats  Sullen you turn'd from both and call'd for  Oats  Others bring Goods and Treasures to their Houses  Something to deck their pretty Babes and Spouses  My  only  Token was a Cup like Horn  That's made of nothing but a Lady's  Corn  'Tis not for that I grieve O 'tis to see  The  Groom  and  Sorrel Mare  prefer'd to me  These for some Moments when you deign to quit  And at due distance sweet Discourse admit  'Tis all my Pleasure thy past Toil to know  For pleas'd Remembrance builds Delight on Woe  At ev'ry Danger pants thy Consort's Breast  And gaping Infants squawle to hear the rest  How did I tremble when by Tousands bound  I saw thee stretch'd on  Lilliputian  Ground  When scaling Armies climb'd up ev'ry Part  Each Step they trod I felt upon my Heart  But when thy Torrent quench'd the dreadful Blaze  King Queen and Nation staring with Amaze  Full in my view how all my Husband came  And what extinguish'd theirs encreas'd my Flame  Those  Spectacles  ordain'd thine Eyes to save  Were once my Present  Love  that Armour gave  How did I mourn at  Bolgolam  's Decree  For when he sign'd thy Death he sentenc'd me  When Folks might see thee all the Country round  For Six pence I'd have giv'n a Thousand pound  Lord when the  Giantbabe  that Head of thine  Got in his Mouth my Heart was up in mine  When in the  Marrowbone  I see thee ramm'd  Or on the Housetop by the  Monkey  cramm'd  The piteous Images renew my Pain  And all thy Dangers I weep o'er again  But on the  Maiden'sNipple  when you rid  Pray Heav'n 'twas all a wanton Maiden did  Glumdalclitch  toowith thee I mourn her Case  Heav'n guard the gentle Girl from all Disgrace  O may the King that one Neglect forgive  And pardon her the Fault by which I live  Was there no other Way to set him free  My Life alas I fear prov'd Death to Thee  O teach me dear new words to speak my Flame  Teach me to wooe thee by thy bestlov'd Name  Whether the Stile of  Grildrig  please thee most  So call'd on  Brobdingnag  's stupendious Coast  When on the Monarch's ample Hand you sate  And hollow'd in his Ear Intrigues of State  Or  Quinbus Flestrin  more Endearment brings  When like a Mountain you look'd down on Kings  If Ducal  Nardae    Lilliputian  Peer  Or  Glumglum  's humbler Title sooth thy Ear  Nay would kind  Jove  my Organs so dispose  To hymn harmonious  Houyhnhnm  thro' the Nose  I'd call thee  Houyhnhnm  that high sounding Name  Thy Children's Noses all should twang the same  So might I find my loving Spouse of course  Endu'd with all the  Virtues  of a  Horse  FINIS
