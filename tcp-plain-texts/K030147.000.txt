Brummagem's house  CHEERLY  LAURA has not appeared at the window yesterday or today and my word is passed not to call at the house till she sends to meyet I cannot get under weigh till she bids me farewell Oh confound it here's Captain Vain What damn'd shift of wind made him bring up on this coast Now will this conceited fellow bother me for an hour or two about himself    Going    Enter  VAIN  Vain  I  see you Cheerly You can't hide yourself from  me  I'm one who see every thing in a  moment You have heard what has happened to  me  since  I  went  Cheerly  No faith I have not  Vain  The most extraordinary thing Always something surprizing wherever  I  go For my part  I  really think as to  myself  thatBut what are you at Cheerly What attempting to spy into your neighbour's cabin Just like  me  egad I've done that often in my time tho' it's hardly fair play between you and  I  Cheerly  Vain you know a seaman cannot act unfairly here is a little frigate in this harbour of which I wou'd fain take the command honorably but her old uncle thinks me too poor to hold the commission  Vain  Exactly  me  again Egad I had best give a little thought to your case  myself  Cheerly  I have told you where my anchor lies Can you lend me a hand to purchase it  Vain  Can I I don't like to praise myself but I am such a devilish clever fellow it is quite astonishingI never turn my head to a project but it succeedsAny thing every thingnever missI'am so clever  I'll  tell youWhat will you give me for releasing this tender consenting girl from old Brummagem's clutches and throwing her into your arms  Cheerly  Give you  Vain  Ay what premium will you allow me on her fortune  Cheerly  This is not a seaman's languageI don't understand you  Vain  Why look you Cheerly I love adventuresI have a genius for them and such a head at them it's astonishing But as this is a time of the world when a man is counted an ass if he be not paid for every thing he does I undertake them no longer as an amateurI have done with thatbut demand my fee regularly as a professor  Cheerly  Indeed  Vain  I have adventured myself in the service of others into easy circumstances and genteel acquaintance and if you will give me a hundred pounds of which I happen to be just now damnably in want  Cheerly  Hold VainThat's not quite so cleveris it  Vain  No but that's so common a case with a geniusIn short if you are inclined to pay  I'll  put you in possession of your Dulcinea  Cheerly  Eh but how How will you carry your warps out Master Vain  Vain  You must not ask thatThere lies my geniusI must manage it all myselfa genius must not be meddled with  Cheerly  Well but do you know old Brummagem  Vain  Know him a fellow full of lies and ignorance who values you only for the number of quarters in your scutcheon tells you long stories of  tables and chairs having been in his family for a hundred years which in reality he bought secondhand yesterday It will be an absolute charity in you to deliver a poor girl from such a curmudgeon And since you have engaged me in your service you have nothing to fear I'm sure to succeed I wont praise myselfbut I'm so astonishingly clever  Exit  Cheerly  I must at all events rescue this lovely girl To lend a helping hand to those who are distress is the character of our country and British seamen have ever set the example  SONG  AIR  CHEERLY  When Britain on the foaming main  Her native reign  Bids her sons their rights declare  Soon as her fires have taught the foe  Again to know  Who their dauntless conqu'rors are  The sailor's bosom swells with joy  Beyond the glory to destroy  He feels the power to save  And conqu'ring views a foe no more  In him who sought his life before  But lifts him from the wave  Tho' seas are rolling mountains high  Our boats we ply  'Tis a fellowcreature falls  See him raise his hands in fear  And wond'ring hear  The cheering voice that life recalls  The sailor's bosom c  Exit  SCENE II  A Library with Globes large

house or the otherGet out    drives them off    My master is a sad old hunks to be sure He hates the plain truth as I do physic while he will swallow chew and digest a parcel of bouncing fibs by the hundred as a man wou'd count walnuts His house is like the fine speeches of fine gentry all conterfeit and the furniture in it would serve for the scenery of a harlequin farce it tumbles to pieces the moment it is touched But then these women prate soNow they've hatched up a story about an iron cageShut up his niece indeed What do they take him for I do so hate womenI hate them all except my young mistress because we were fostered togetherI can't be expected to hate herBut I hate Selina and I hate Dolly tho' I never saw her before and I hateNo I don't hate  FannyI wish I couldWell I think she'll have me and when we're married I dare say I shall hate her for I know she will use me like a dog but I cannot hate her for all that Oh Lord here she comes but I won't speak to her    takes a chair sits down and as Fanny enters turns from her    Enter  FANNY  Fanny  What's the matter Ralph  Ralph  I am thinking  Fanny  And pray what are you thinking of  Ralph  You  Fanny  I am much obliged to you but you had better by half think of our young mistress who will be brought back presently to be shut up in an iron cage  Ralph  So they are all in the same story  Fanny  'Tis a shame  Ralph  How can you talk such nonsense What does my master want to force her to  Fanny  Marriage  Ralph  That wou'd be out of one cage into another  Fanny  Cannot we contrive to help her Ralph You know she cannot love a strange man whom she has never seen Why don't you answer  Ralph  I am thinkingwhat I can do not to love  you  Fanny  Psha do not be nonsensical Don't you see what an excellent match Captain Cheerly  will be for Miss Laura A brave sailor who fights for his country and whom she would marry for love Why do not you answer again  Ralph  I am thinkingthat if you and I should be married for love we might chance to fight for victuals  Fanny  Aye but we'll be married for all that  Ralph discomposed and turning his chair about  Shall we  Fanny  Yes and you shall be so smart you shall look like a captain You know as my young mistress's husband is an officer in the navy when you and I marry you may wear a cockade in your hat as well as any captain of them all  Ralph  Wear a cockade I am thinking if you and I marry    puts his hand to his forehead    if I shall be able to wear a hat No I'll never marry I'm determin'd I'll leave service rather than be made a fool of by the women  Fanny  I tell you we will be married  Ralph  And I tell you we won'tAnd I'll tell you why we won't  Fanny  Nay but I declare  Ralph  Do but listen to me That little tongue of yours  Fanny  Listen Why Lord bless me  Ralph  Will you hear me only for one minute  Fanny  Yes but then you shall hear me for a minute afterwards  Ralph  Well so I will That's fair  Fanny  Wellnow I'm ready to listen  Ralph  Without speaking  Fanny  I give you leave to say just what you like  Ralph  Oh leave me alone for that  Fanny  You need not fear my interrupting you I give you my word  Ralph  Well that's all I want  Fanny  I'll keep my word too when I've once said so  Ralph  Well well I believe that  Fanny  NowI'm dumb  Ralph  That's best  Fanny  Mum I won't open my mouth to draw my breath Only rememberyou shan't say I don't give you a fair hearing  Ralph  But you are talking now  Fanny  Nay that's monstrous when you have been talking all this while  Ralph  I why I am sure I have not spoke yet  Fanny  I am sure you have and you must have talked your minute out by this time That you have at least and now it's my turn  Ralph  Now did any one ever hear such a  Fanny  Nay I protest I will have my minute now  Ralph  Why I have not begun mine  Fanny  Keep to your bargain  Ralph  Oh a plague of  Fanny  Nay if you run on at this rate I'm resolved  I won't stay to hear you I won't come near you again till you have learnt to hold your tongue as I do  Exit Fanny  Ralph  Oh a plague of these women They are just like  AIR  RALPH  A woman is like tobut stay  What a woman is like who can say  There's no living with or without one  Love bites like a fly  Now an ear now an eye  Buz buz always buzzing about one  When she's tender and kind  She is like to my mind  And Fanny was so I remember  She is like toO dear  She's as good very near  As a ripe melting peach in September  If she laugh and she chat  Play joke and all that  And with smiles and good humour she meet me  She is like a rich dish  Of ven'son or sish  That cries from the table "Come eat me"  But she'll plague you and vex you  Distract and perplex you  Falsehearted and ranging  Unsettled and changing  What then do you think she is like  Like a sand Like a rock  Like a wheel Like a clock  Aye a clock that is always at strike  Her head's like the island folks tell on  Which nothing but monkies can dwell on  Her heart's like a lemon so nice  She carves for each lover a slice  In truth she's to me  Like the wind like the sea  Whose raging will hearken to no man  Like a mill  Like a pill  Like a flail  Like a whale  Like an ass  Like a glass  Whose image is constant to no man  Like a flower  Like a shower  Like a fly  Like a pye  Like a pea  Like a flea  Like a thief  Likein brief  She's like nothing on earthbut a woman  Exit  SCENE III  An Apartment at  BRUMMAGEM'S  Enter  FANNY  Fanny  So there they goI hear him lock her in Well if I had been miss Laura I wou'd have run at once to captain Cheerly    affectedly    It's a thousand pities she's troubled with so many delicaciesI wish Ralph was half as well inclined to meI give him good plain hints tho' I cannot say they have hitherto been of any service  AIR  FANNY  E'er since I found truelove beginning  And thought his hand was worth the winning  I call'd each little artful aid in  To spare the question from a maiden  To wake or show  When ask'd to go  I still denied  All lads beside  And pray'd of Ralph to carry me  It seem'd so pat  In tender chat  To whisper "Fanny will you marry me"  In ev'ning fine and summer weather  When o'er the fields we walk'd together  Tho' I can trip it like a fairy  I've oft pretended to be weary  Then leaning on his arm awhile  I slily ask'd him with a smile  "I'm tir'd Ralph will you carry me"  But on the way  He ne'er wou'd stay  To whisper "Fanny will you marry me"  Exit  SCENE IV  A Room with a Table cover'd with Papers Pen and Ink in the back Scene a Door of an inner Apartment a Window that looks into the Street  BRUMMAGEM  locking the door puts the key in his girdle  Brum  There I think that settles the business The keys are pretty safe by my side and the door  is pretty strongI am still so afraid of that

Brum  Ralph I put you in charge of this room in my absenceDon't let any one come near that door and if the maids come to touch any thing drive them out  going  Ralph  Never fear sirI'll be a match for any maid in Christendom  Brum returns  And hark ye Ralph  Ralph  Yes sir  Brum  If sir Andrew M'Gorget should happen to come during my absence  Ralph  I'll drive him away never fearhe shan't go near the door  Brum  Psha you blockhead you must let him come and tell him I am only gone to enquire news of him at the inn Be sure you don't let the maids in I had rather turn a tiger loose into my cabinet than a woman and should be less alarmed at the roaring of the one than the chattering of the other  Exit  Ralph  I thought it was so He has brought home some great curiosity the irongrating was to keep off the mops and broomsticks and this  outer door to keep the dust off    tries to look into the inner apartment    I cannot get a peep any where What am I to do by myself here    sits

crocodile    sits down again and having finished his first apple begins another which proves a bad one    A few lines A long letter is worse thanPa a rotten applePha    rises and flings the rotten apple out at the window then sits down again to write    forced to leave youlove you    a noise within the scenes    Cheerly without  But I say I willAm I to have my eyes knocked out with apples  Ralph  O Lord I have hit some one in the eye with that appleWhat an unlucky dog I am I had better get out of his way  Exit  Enter  CHEERLY  holding his handker chief to his eye  VAIN  following  Vain  Hear what  I  tell youIf you make this disturbance I shall lose all chance of success  Cheerly  I shall lose my sight I'll search the house over till I find the old man who shall either beg my pardon

Selina we might contrive somethingGenius is so whimsical that I believe money frightens it away  Laura within  Cheerly  Vain  Hark  Laura  Cheerly  Vain  That must be LauraI'll pass for Cheerly

came in with his one eye I might have stood a chance of a couple of black ones    looks out    Yonder's my cruel masterNow I shall hate him I won't own a word of captain Cheerly having been here If he asks any questions I must fob him off with half a score bouncing stories in his own wayI don't care what I say to him now That he shou'd be such a hardhearted cruel abominable  Enter  BRUMMAGEM  Brum  Who were those fellows I saw lurking about Has there been any one here  Ralph  Not a soul sirI must have seen them if they had been here sir  Brum  You have not seen or heard any one  Ralph  Only poor miss Laura who has been crying there sir  Brum  Ah that's nothingGirls love to shed tears  Ralph crying  I believe I love to shed tears tooI cannot help it when I think of poor miss Laura my own

tight and brave  As ever stemm'd the dashing wave  Her men are staunch  To their favorite launch  And when the foe shall meet our fire  Sooner than strike we'll all expire  On board of the Arethusa  'Twas with the spring fleet she went out  The English Channel to cruise about  When four French sail in shew so stout  Bore down on the Arethusa  The fam'd Belle Poule straight a head did lie  The Arethusa seem'd to fly  Not a sheet or a tack  Or a brace did she slack  Tho' the Frenchmen laugh'd and thought it stuff  But the knew not the handful of men how tough  On board of the Arethusa  On deck five hundred men did dance  The stoutest they could find in France  We with two hundred did advance  On board of the Arethusa  Our captain hail'd the Frenchman "Ho"  The Frenchman then cried out "Hallo"  "Bear down d'ye see  "To our admiral's lee"  "No no" says the Frenchman "that can't be"  "Then I must lug you along with me"  Says the saucy Arethusa  The fight was off the Frenchman's land  We forc'd them back upon their strand  For we fought till not a stick wou'd stand  Of the gallant Arethusa  And now we've driven the foe ashore  Never to fight with Britons more  Let each fill a glass  To his favorite lass  A health to our captain and officers true  And all that belong to the jovial crew  On board of the Arethusa  Exeunt  SCENE IV  Apartment with the Door that covers the Iron

chairs They sit    Exit Fanny  Ralph aside  Ay before you think of it old rogue  Taking his chocolate  Pho this is too hot it burns my mouth  Brum  It may be a little too hot but this sir is some of

in my house these nine years  Ralph aside  I fetch'd it myself from the chandler's shop this morning  Enter  FANNY  agitated    Fanny  Sir there's a gentleman come  Brum  What's the matter with the

Vain  You seem to be studying my dress I imagine it surprizes you in this country    aside    I hope he does not suspect that Selina pilfered it from his own museum  Brum  I protest sir Andrew I don't know you in it  Vain aside  No I trust notI don't wonder at that Mr Brummagem The alteration it makes is astonishing This is the exact dress of the noble Spaniards  Brum  Ay I have one which descended into my possession by means of a great uncle of mine who lived in Spain and had it presented to him by the queen at a bullfightBut I thought at present the mode was altered  Vain  Not with the grandees They are obliged indeed by the laws to have other cloaths but they wear them by proxy  Brum  Proxy  Vain  We nobles in Spain do every thing by proxy For instance now you think I carry no

There my dear friendYou see that is carrying things in my pocket by proxy    Brum sneezes    May you live a thousand years  Brum  Eh  Vain  Excuse me that's a common phrase in SpainIt means bless you

Probably one of your friends    seeing Ralph    Ralph  So now I shall be finely blown    aside    Brum  Odso I forgot to mention to you that your steward was arrived The joy of seeing you quite put him out of my head  Vain  My steward  Brum  Aye don't you see him Yonder he is  Vain  Yes yes I see him    aside    I see I'm got into a pretty scrape    Turns away from Ralph who does the same from

be sure he doesI told him so just now Don't you speak to sir Andrew  Ralph keeping his back still turned to Vain  Perhaps sir Andrew may not be at leisure to be spoken to at present  Brum  He is mighty humble at once I suppose these grandees of Spain claim the privilege of speaking first  Vain  Brummagem  Brum  Sir Andrew    goes to the other side to Vain  Vain  Does my steward know that I am come  Brum  I believe he has not seen you but what is his name I'll call him to you  Vain  Plaguymidamnamo  Brum  That's a damn'd odd name Wo'n't you be pleas'd to let Plaguymidamnamo approach you

wait for me at the inn  Brum crosses the stage to Ralph  Plaguymidamnamo sir Andrew will let you approach him at the inn and not at this house    Ralph runs out Vain still keeping his back turn'd to him    So I see he wo'n't even look at the steward except by proxy  Vain aside  That's well got rid of That's my genius    to Brum    But come let us think of your charming niecethere is no time to be lost Have you settled the day and manner of the nuptials  Brum  As early a day as you please  Vain  Today if possible and the ceremonials public  Brum  With all my heart In what manner will you take

keys from his girdle    Vain  Bless me my dear friend you are very cautious    Ralph Fanny and Dolly appear watching    Brum  Why the trouble of watching a young girl every minute is rather too much for an old man so I employ these two proxies    shews keys    Ralph  But are you sure of what you say of captain Vain  Dolly  Main sure I seed him talking with Mrs Seliny  Ralph  It is he sure enough so at last I know what these two keys belong to    enters strutting    Vain  Oh a plague this fellow again  Brum  How do you presume to come back sir in defiance of the will of your master which I delivered as his proxy  Ralph  Why sir do you take this for sir Andrew  Vain  So now if my genius deserts me  Ralph  You are imposed on  Brum  How imposed on What are not you sir Andrew M'Gorget  Vain  Certainly sir  Ralph  You my dear lord the grandee sir AndrewPray sir  to Brum  ask him what town sir Andrew lived at in Spain    aside    It is best to be beforehand with him in these questions  Brum  Ay very true what town did you live at in Spain  Vain  The town sir Why the town sirOh the town Why Barcelona to be sure  Ralph  There sirWas that the town  Brum  Why yes to be sure Barcelona was the town  Ralph aside  The devil it was Let him answer in what ship he took his passage home    sees Vain confused    Oh all is safe Let him answer that  Vain aside  I see this fellow must go snacks with meGive me leave BrummagemHark ye steward    takes Ralph aside    I have a purpose to answer in passing for your master at presentIf you will go halves with me in a hundred pounds you may  Ralph  Not I indeed    aloud    I dare say you have a purpose  Vain in a low voice  Now for heaven's sake  Ralph  I go shares with you  Vain  Fifty pounds    low    Ralph  Leave the house directly or    loud    Vain  Sixty    low    Ralph  I'll let Mr Brummagem know    loud Brum comes near to them    Vain  A hundred    low    Ralph  That you are  Vain  The devil  Ralph  You may be for aught I know  Brum  Mercy on me What is all this  Vain  A plague of this unseasonable interruption there is nothing left but decamping Mr Brummagem you'll excuse meI'll take another opportunityDamn it my genius has failed me    Brum beats Vain off    Ralph still speaking to him  I have a great mind to let Mr Brummagem know who you are  Brum eagerly puis on his hat  Who is he In the name of wonder who is the dog  Ralph  His name is Vain  Brum  What captain Vain an impudent scoundrel  Ralph  To think of imposing on you  Brum  With his "Live a thousand years"  Ralph  A vulgar fellow when no gentleman in Spain ever wishes you to live less than ten thousand at least  Brum  I begin to enjoy it now the danger's over It will make a curious anecdote in my life    aside    with proper embellishments  Ralph  It reminds me of a singular circumstance that sir Andrew sends me an account of in his last letter  Brum  Ay what was that  Ralph  Whybut I keep you standing    takes a chair and sits    Pray Brummy no ceremonies  Brum  Egad I see you use none    takes a chair likewise and sits    Ralph  Sir Andrew gives an accountI believe I have the letter in my pocket    takes a letter from his pocket    Brum puts on his spectacles  Ah let me hear all that sir Andrew says  Ralph reads  "A young man of this place"  Brum  Where is it dated From Barcelona Eh    peering over letter    Ralph aside  It is lucky that I happen to know thatOh from Barcelona certainlyBut why need I read I'll tell it youA young man was desperately in love with a girl of good fortune and the father denied his consent and wanted to marry her against her inclinations  Brum  More fool he Well  Ralph  Wherefore they laid a scheme to join the young people's hands under the father's nose  Brum  Ah and how did they manage it  Ralph  One day the old man comes home as usual with a hat as large    takes Brum's hat from his head    aye larger than yours    puts the hat on the table making signs occasionally as to some one without    and  seeing some strangers coming about the house takes up his cane that he always carried as you do    takes cane from Brummagem's hand    This is a gold head  Brum  Oh the purest gold of Spain It was given to my grandfather by the  Ralph  Ay no matter I thought as much Well he takes his cane and runs to his coffers where he kept his money for sir Andrew says he did not suspect the design on his daughter  Brum  Oh a simpleton  Ralph  Quite a fool Now his money was all fast secured under two stout keys such as these    takes the keys from Brummagem's girdle dangles'em about and lays them on the table    and forth he sets to beat the rogues from his coffers  Brum  Well well  Ralph  In the mean time while he was busy at his coffers a maid servant coming behind his back    Fanny enters unobserved by Brummagemtakes the keys off table opens the door which she leaves unlockt lays the keys down again on the table    takes the keys goes to her young mistress's door opens it lets the young lady know that her lover was waiting in the next room with a clergyman to marry them before they left the house  Brum  Well there was some decency in the young folks at least  Ralph  Oh sir Andrew says he was a most excellent young man  Brum  But suppose now the father had happened to meet the maid on this errand    turning sees Fanny  who had just replaced the keys    what do you want here hussey  Fanny  I came to see if you would have the chocolatecup taken away sir  Brum  Oh very wellAy by all means This is some of the finest china that  Fanny carries out the cups  But I say my dear friend    replaces the keys in his girdle    suppose he had met the maid  Ralph  Why that would have been unlucky to be sureBut as it happen'd he never suspected her  Brum  Well and so  Ralph  The young lady was all in readiness to sly to her lover but so overcome with fear that she durst not venture to leave the room upon which her lover  Cheerly conducted by Fanny crosses the stage unobserv'd by Brummagem and both go into Laura's room  goes to her room to encourage    aside    So far all is safe  Brum  Oh oh my dear friend but whatAll this happen before the father's face  Ralph  No no Brummy you misunderstand me They went behind the father's back  Brum  Egad it is lucky the old gentleman didn't turn his head round What a pretty kettle of fish there wou'd have been  Ralph  Oh but thenAye very trueI had forgot to tell you one circumstance This scheme was managed by a rogue of a servant who played the old fool the most ludicrous trickI cannot help laughing when I think of it    Brum affects to laugh    I'll shew you how they contriv'd it  they turn towards each other  Brum  By all means It's a good story I dare say  Ralph  Excellent I'll shew you Well now you shall suppose I am this rogue of a servant  Brum  Good  Ralph  And that you are the fool of a father  Brum  With all my heart  Ralph  Now I take your large hatsuch a one we'll suppose as this    takes Brum's hat from table    or larger and I clap it entirely over your face    ties a handkerchief over the hat    Now turn your head about first on one side then on the other side What do you see  Brum  Nothing to be sure  Ralph  Well while I keep this hat close over your eyes forth comes the whole processionfirst the maid servant with a bundle of her mistress's cloaths    Fanny comes out of Laura's room with a bundle of cloaths and exit Cheerly and Laura following her    Brum trying to lift up the hat or peep from it  Ay very good  Ralph  Then the lover supporting the poor frighten'd damsel  Brum  Ay very good  Ralph  And lastly she herself as anxious to escape as a prisoner for life from his prison but trembling with fear lest her father should hear her for if he had you know    Cheerly and Laura go off    Ha ha ha You know  Brum  Ha ha    looking from behind the hat    Very true I comprehend youHow their hearts must have leapt when they got clear off  Ralph  Ayand when their hands were instantly joined by the clergyman in the next room  Brum  A rare story indeed And very rarely contrived Not like poor captain Vain's with his fool's coat and his thousand years  Ralph  No 'twas managed by a much cleverer fellow You may take off the hatthe story's over    takes off the hat    Brum  And where did this happen  Ralph  In Devonshire  Brum  In Devonshire Why you said it was in Spain  Ralph  Aye Devonshire in Spain  Brum  And what sort of an ass is the old man  Ralph  Much such another as yourself  Brum  As me  Ralph  His name's Brummagem  Brum  That's my name  Ralph  The
