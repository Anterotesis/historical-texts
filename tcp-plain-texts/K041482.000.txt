Emperor of Germany His first wife Mary being dead he espoused about the year Barbara the daughter of Hernan Count of Cilley Sigismond made the Counts of Cilley independent Princes of the Empire and called them to the Diets without the consent of the House of Austria their supreme Lords who unwilling to emancipate the County from its dependance upon them declared war against the Count in possession By Barbara Sigismond had only one child a daughter named Elizabeth Sigismond died  Albert V Duke of Austria who had married Elizabeth Sigismond's daughter succeeded him in the Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary Albert died leaving two daughters his Queen Elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death the child proved a son and was named Ladislaus  Upon the death of Albert II as Emperor and V as Duke of Austria his cousin Frederick great grandson of Albert II Duke of Austria was immediately elected Emperor  The Hungarians almost constantly engaged in war against the Turks either for the defence of their own country or of the neighbouring states deemed an infant Prince and a Queen Regent unequal to the safe government of a kingdom which by frequent wars was kept in continual alarm The crown of Hungary by the constitution of the kingdom being elective though sometimes possessed in hereditary succession Uladislaus the young King of Poland was chosen King by the advice of John Corvin Huniades Earl of Bistrie whom Uladislaus made Vaywode of Transylvania Huniades was as celebrated for his virtues as for his valour He was pious towards God faithful to his country and his prince and kind and benevolent to his friends as a warrior he was politic of invincible courage and mostly fortunate he was the first Christian commander who showed that the Turks might be overcome and he obtained more victories against them than any one of the Christian Princes before him  Sir William Temple says that "Huniades was one of the three Worthies who deserved a Crown without wearing one" The reward merited by the virtues and great talents of the father was paid to the son for in the Hungarians from their love to Huniades and grateful remembrance of his long services chose his son Matthias Corvinus for their King    Elizabeth unable to prevent this choice put her son Uladislaus under the protection of the Emperor Frederick III Thus of Albert's possessions only Austria and the kingdom of Bohemia remained unalienated from his posthumous son Ladislaus  In the battle of Varna fought between the Turks commanded by their King Amurath II and the Hungarians led by Huniades Uladislaus the King of Hungary was slain Huniades by whose side he fought having left him to go and rally the left wing of the Christian army  The Hungarians now elected Albert's son Ladislaus King and they chose Huniades their General Governor of Hungary during his minority The Emperor Frederick detaining the infant King in Germany Huniades as Governor of Hungary declared war against him After a long contest which the Hungarians were obliged to intermit on account of their wars against the Turks the Emperor not strong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incursions of the Hungarians at last in delivered up their king then eleven years of age An assembly was appointed at Vienna to which the nobles of Hungary and Bohemia were invited At this assembly it was decreed that during the minority of Ladislaus Huniades should govern Hungary that George Podiebrad should govern Bohemia and that Ulrick Count of Cilley great uncle to the King should govern Austria and be guardian of his person  Count Cilley envious of the glory of Huniades excited some parties of Bohemians and Moravians to attack Upper Austria but they proved unsuccessful when opposed by Huniades Ambitious of the government of Hungary Count Cilley accused Huniades the Governor to the King but he justified  himself from the accusation Count Cilley's ambition increasing with the power which he derived from being the King's guardian he attempted to make himself absolute master of Austria To effect which he secured the principal fortresses by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his interest gradually removing Elsinger and the Austrian nobility from all offices of importance This conduct gave great umbrage to the people Elsinger took advantage of their discontent and aided by Huniades obliged Ulrick to retire to his own territory of Cilley Thus by the bravery and conduct of these two warriors Austria was wrested from Count Cilley's usurpation  Mahomet II the seventh King and the first Emperor of the Turks who took Constantinople May which his great grandfather Bajazet I and his father Amurath II had unsuccessfully besieged marched  New Universal History vol XXVI p there is a mistake in the date of this Siege of Belgrade which is there put down AD and in vol XXXII p the date is which last agrees with other Historians  with an army of men to besiege Belgrade then thought the key to Hungary  As soon as the report of Mahomet's intention to besiege Belgrade reached the young King Ladislaus then fifteen years of age he fled to the court of the Emperor Frederick which much displeased his Hungarian subjects as it had before cost them a long and tedious contest to get him out of the Emperor's power  Besides his numerous army of men Mahomet provided a fleet of ships and gallies which he sent up the Danube from Viden to Belgrade to the intent that no relief or aid should be brought into the city out of Hungary by the great rivers of the Danube and the Save upon the confluence of which the city of Belgrade stands Not contented with thus closely blockading the city on all sides Mahomet sent part of his fleet further up the Danube and landing troops spoiled the country in many places on the banks of the river On his first coming before Belgrade he made a fierce assault but was repulsed he found the Hungarians ready to receive him and prepared to skirmish with his troops without the walls as well as to defend the city Mahomet finding his arms so resolutely opposed began to proceed more warily and intrenched his army He provided for its safety against the sudden sallies of the besieged by casting up deep trenches and strong rampires After planting his battery he began to shake the wall of the city most furiously with his great artillery insomuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground But the defendants with great labour and industry speedily repaired it by casting up new fortifications and rampires so that it was stronger than before  Campestran a Franciscan monk having at this time preached in Germany a crusade against the Turks had collected an army of men With  these his followers he entered Belgrade to assist in its defence against Mahomet who was become the terror of all Christendom by his conquests his enterprising genius his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age his indefatigable industry in the pursuit of whatever he undertook his irresistible courage his insatiable cruelty his avowed impiety his bloodthirstiness his immeasurable ambition his impious treachery and his unrelenting flintyhearted severity so that against his ambition there was no mound on his faith or friendship no dependance and in his least displeasure death  Huniades who was gone to Upper Hungary to raise supplies was expected to sail from Buda with a fleet of ships and gallies stored with warlike provisions when Mahomet having been a month before Belgrade prepared to give a general assault although his superstitious troops were much dispirited from the appearance of two comets  D'Ohsson's Hist Gen of the Othoman Empire vol p  and

AND THE SULTAN'S TENT BEFORE IT  Era  AD Timefrom the Noon of the th of August to Sunrising August th  ADVERTISEMENT  In the representation many passages were left out they are not however distinguished as they will easily be perceived by persons acquainted with the nature of stage effect  HUNIADES OR THE SIEGE OF BELGRADE  Act First  SCENE FIRSTA HALL OF STATE  Several doors from inner apartments opening into the hall In the front folding doors Count Cilley coming forward through them a couch seen in the inner apartment from which he rises as the curtain draws up Rodolpho following him  COUNT CILLEY RODOLPHO  COUNT CILLEY  IT mocks belief Huniades arriv'd  His fleet in sight engaging with the Turk's  Demons of air in whirlwinds scatter both  Thou roaring Danube whelm them in thy flood  Destroy Huniades though he destroy'd  Plumed victory should forsake the Christian banner  And give to Mahomet unbounded empire  RODOLPHO  This passionate deportment tends to ruin  Your bounty has allur'd the people's hearts  Because they see no motive but their interest  Which stimulates your ardour to relieve them  The mine you dig should they suspect your purpose  Would be blown up with danger to yourself  Let circumspection guard what art has won  Opposeless is a foe newcrown'd by victory  Huniades now reigns in every heart  These succours swiftly rais'd and timely come  To their relief have chang'd the people's murmurings  To joy and gratitude Should you exclaim  Against their idol you excite suspicion  Still in the people's interest seem absorb'd  Seem joyful that Huniades is come  With fresh supplies to feed their wives and children  This if he bring them not sows discontent  COUNT CILLEY  Curse on his coming for it gives the lie  To all I prophesy'd of his delay  And drooping courage Long has he been seen  RODOLPHO  Three hours  COUNT CILLEY  Why instantly was I not told  When the fleet came in sight Art thou too leagu'd  With fortune and my foes against my wishes  My favours merit better service from thee  Thy too late warning leaves me now no power  To form such plans as should have foil'd his speed  RODOLPHO  Vain fruitless thought thy passion warps thy judgment  Thou might'st as well hope to arrest yon Sun  In mid career as stop this gallant chief  When ardent in his country's cause he comes  Yet had I known my Lord you would have thank'd  The man who told you that your foe was near  I could have summon'd you from needed sleep  To see a grateful people mad with joy  To hear one voice of praise ascend the skies  That great Huniades their guardian genius  Their tutelary God was come to save them  COUNT CILLEY  Peace for my illplaced anger taunt me not  Huniades the man I fear and envy  Whom I with deadly hate detesthe comes  Unsated vengeance fires my soul to phrenzy  Gods he triumphant comes Give me some hope  Contrive some means that he may fall my victim  RODOLPHO  Be calm and opportune event may aid you  Without supplies the city must surrender  If now Huniades relieve Belgrade  The frighted King will strait return to celebrate  His sister's marriage with the Servian prince  The Princess gone the Regent's power is sapp'd  The guardianship of such a peerless gem  As your fair niece gives power to rise still higher  'Tis rumour'd that his son Corvinus dar'd  To ask her hand  COUNT CILLEY  How my niece wed Corvinus  By heaven she never shall whilst I have life  I first would give Belgrade although the key  Of the Hungarian realm to Mahomet  And he would rid me both of son and father  Huniades his blood commix with mine  Corvinus and Agmunda then would mount  My coward nephew's throne supplanting me  Accursed scheme rise every fiend to blast it  RODOLPHO  The Regent has himself that danger warded  Glory and not ambition is his God  He made the Princess at the altar swear  Never to wed his son But other cares  Demand your present thoughts A hasty council  Has been conven'd which soon broke up commanding  Such troops to muster in Saint Julian's Square  As can be spar'd from duty on the walls  These from the western gate led by Corvinus  In one vast column through the Turkish camp  Must fight their way against redoubling foes  Whilst with his troops and hoped supplies Huniades  Shall disembark In this their purpos'd sally  A thousand of your Austrian troops they ask  To march with the rearguard and flank the river  The ground maintaining which the van shall gain  And their retreat back to Belgrade secure  COUNT CILLEY  Ask me to aid the triumph of Huniades  Bid the wreck'd seaman quit the plank he clings to  Bid the parch'd wretch when fever fires his blood  Part with the cooling beverage from his lip  'Tis a gross insult to demand my troops  Not one shall march beneath Corvinus' standard  RODOLPHO  Think of the consequence of this refusal  'Twould sound unpopular and most suspicious  That Austria's Regent the King's guardian  And his great Uncle too refus'd his aid  Stores to convey into a town besieged  Where every citizen eats scanty bread  Without these succours famine will ensue  Belgrade must yield and with it falls a kingdom  Your aid is not of service to your foe  But to yourself worded the people's friend  You lose their confidence if in this misery  Your deeds desert them Let not fury blind you  Weigh with your wonted policy your interest  Revenge and hate must wait a riper hour  COUNT CILLEY  I know not that their hour perhaps is  now    My spirits feel a prescience which prolaims  The balance of my fate aloft is pois'd  And shall I make the adverse scale preponderate  pauses  Gods give me empire let me reign or die  I would command my fate nor owe to chance  My envy'd height Huniades destroy'd  The Regency of Hungary is mine  Then this Boy King the people will depose  Huniades whilst Regent more defends him  Than could embattled legions arm'd to save him  RODOLPHO  My Lord the exigence demands despatch  Zilugo urged me for a speedy answer  Resolve lest your delay excite suspicion  And make him penetrate your secret motive  I know he views your conduct with distrust  And lynxeyed jealousy may view it right  Unless you warily avoid its ken  COUNT CILLEY  Be thine the craft t'elude his penetration  Smoothing my answer to a courteous form  This Governour I fain would win so tell him  My troops should in this enterprise take part  To the last man but that I fear the Sultan  When we shall sally to convoy the succours  Will try to force the eastern gate by storm  This and the wall adjacent I must guard  To draught my troops should an assault be given  Would be most certain danger to Belgrade  I but withhold them for important service  More perilous far than that which I decline  Grace this with all the artifice of speech  And speak me such as he would wish to find me  To my Lieutenant then the order give  That Cosmo shall the eastern gate command  And Hernan's regiment surround the palace  Report my fears that the Turks mean to storm  And instantly to arms my Austrians call  RODOLPHO  Is this parade meant but to blind the council  Or have these preparations other motives  Instruct me lest I fail to aid your purpose  COUNT CILLEY  This palace I will seize My niece the Princess  Leagu'd with my foes or not shall be my prisoner  Till I succeed and if I fail my victim  I must harangue the crowd distribute money  Accuse Huniades of breach of faith  That he has plann'd his son should wed the Princess  Dethrone my nephew and usurp his crown  If this inflame the people as I wish  Corvinus and Huniades return'd  spoken with insidious meaning  Shall be for treason seiz'd and thou their guard  As thou wast Elsinger's The Monk Campestran  Fanatic priest shall writhe beneath my vengeance  I'll seize the Sword his insolence refus'd me  Bless'd by the Pope the people hold it sacred  Thinking miraculous power attends the wearer  Campestran shall repent his proud defiance  Without his aid sole Regent of this realm  Belgrade shall hail me and ere long its King  With thy accustom'd zeal my orders execute  Exit Rodolpho  SCENE SECOND  COUNT CILLEY THE GOVERNOR MICHAEL ZILUGO  Zilugo enters hastily as Rodolpho goes out  COUNT CILLEY  What trouble read I in your looks Zilugo  ZILUGO  Grief at the loud laments of starving thousands  And at the silent tears of hardy veterans  Drooping dismay'dThe fleet is now in flames  COUNT CILLEY  The Regent's fleet which came this morn in sight  ZILUGO  Is now destroying Nought can be seen of it  For bursting flames and volumes of thick smoke  Which the west wind towards the city blows  We fear our godlike champion now expires  Or chain'd is led in triumph by the victor  I have just call'd the council to advise  What in this exigence we ought to do  Fain would Corvinus sally forth with all  Our force at the west gate and through the invaders  On that side now redoubling force a passage  And save from Mahomet his gallant Father  With those brave troops who may escape the flames  COUNT CILLEY  The attempt is madness What risk our whole force  To save  one  man Hazard Belgrade for him  ZILUGO  Huniades  that One  hazard an Empire  Though gratitude were dumb yet interest pleads  For seven score thousand Turks inur'd to war  Round our beleaguer'd walls have trenches open'd  And our own safety now demands his aid  Who but himself had fought against their fleet  This morn Yet he undaunted Chief engag'd  Their ships at fearful odds Had victory smil'd  Boldly must he his landing have made good  I' the teeth of all the Sultan's chosen soldiers  And after that although you think it madness  For us to pass athwart the Turkish lines  Yet he with not the tenth of half our force  Would through their camp have hewn himself a path  Then with tir'd troops from a third battle panting  Belgrade had been again by him reliev'd  This godlike man shall we with coward caution  Desert now when for us he stands the mark  Of hostile rage  COUNT CILLEY  Defeat in mid career  His boldness stops and with less daring prudence  Warns us to act nor by our ruin grace  His fall Huniades or dead or captive  The tottering state must chuse another Regent  A Nation's praise will that brave man deserve  Who in this peril dares to take the helm  ZILUGO  Now at this stormy crisis to be Regent  Is to encounter toil and certain danger  A thankless office where all may be lost  And nothing can be won Much the King's flight  To Frederick's court the people has displeas'd  This beardless King deserting his own cause  Is grown unpopular The soldiers fight  Deadhearted Yet where great Corvinus leads  Adoring him with ready swords they follow  Another Regent strew'd with thorns will find  His road unless our wellplac'd choice select  That hero whom the soldiers love and fear  COUNT CILLEY  A Regent must be chosen or this Corvinus  This boy will arrogate his Father's power  Defy the council's orders waste our strength  And lose the city of the most importance  In the Hungarian realm If you should aid  This rash exploit I shall suspect your loyalty  Traitors I deem Corvinus and Huniades  Who would usurp my infant Nephew's throne  To guard his rights I claim the General's truncheon  Enter a Messenger  MESSENGER  addressing the Governor  My Lord approaching tow'rds the eastern gate  A train of Turks appears so very numerous  That it resembles more a hostile army  Than a state embassy They sound a parley  ZILUGO  Let trumpets from the eastern tower accept it  And send forth Heralds to demand their purpose  Which here report  Exit Messenger  COUNT CILLEY  Now shew your zeal to serve  The state and in the council name me Regent  ZILUGO  Forego that thought nor hazard a repulse  My Lord at present if the council chuse  A man for that high office much I doubt  Nay I foretell they never will name you  COUNT CILLEY  And yet this realm demands my care Zilugo  This new alliance with the Prince of Servia  Will keep the sword for ever in our hands  Against the Turk who when he quits Belgrade  With fire and sword will ravage Servia  Which by the treaty we are bound to succour  Huniades has some base views in this  Some secret tribute or some promis'd service  My Niece is sold  ZILUGO  Unjust are your suspicions  The Regent knows no interest but his Country's  And Servia aided by our arms will prove  Hungaria's bulwark 'gainst the Turk's invasion  Therefore he gives the Princess to Matthias  Although her heart in secret loves another  Yet has his counsel o'er that love prevail'd  For the state's welfare and his sovereign's safety  COUNT CILLEY  And can you Governor approve this marriage  The Servian Prince will like his treacherous father  Deceitful prove that father who before you  Murder'd your Brother basely in cold blood  ZILUGO  My sword the traitor slew and justice satisfy'd  Resentment sleeps within its victim's tomb  COUNT CILLEY  Had I a Regent's power I would oppose  This purpos'd marriage highly I dislike it  Form'd by Huniades it hides some treason  Let my Niece wed with some Hungarian Lord  Whose service such a high reward may merit  Amongst the gallant nobles of this realm  I know not who has from the state Zilugo  Such claims to honour as yourself Your son  ZILUGO  haughtily  I understand you Count I know my interest  Is with the Council of sufficient weight  For such a bribe and when inclin'd to sell  Honour and faith I know a purchaser  Who wanting both would give a prodigal price  Glut my revenge and my ambition feed  COUNT CILLEY  I prize your zeal and therefore court your friendship  'Tis my esteem for you which makes me chuse  Your Son to wed my Niece Whilst to your merit  I am thus just you through mistake oppose me  ZILUGO  It now behoves me bluntly to inform you  You lose your dignity in these attempts  Your sanguine temper grasps at unjust power  Which vested in you would prove dangerous  The man who asks more than he ought to have  Must meet repulse When honest minds are rous'd  To oppose audacity respect is lost  In that contempt which all unfair designs  Whether in public or in private life  Sooner or later ever must incur  COUNT CILLEY  half drawing his sword  I'll teach your bluntness to contemn my power  ZILUGO  drawing his sword and retreating  Ulrick this sword is practis'd 'gainst assassins  COUNT CILLEY  drawing his sword advances  As man to man in equal fight advance  ZILUGO  No whilst my sword can serve my Country's cause  I will not use it but for her except  To guard my life If I escape the peril  Which now awaits us call me forththe friend  Of Elsinger will meet you brave fallen Elsinger  His and our noble Regent's threatening sword  Kept from your grasp all Austria's rich domains  For had not they in your career oppos'd you  Instead of Guardian to your infant Nephew  You first had rebel been and then usurper  The power you have our nobles think unsafe  Therefore the Council will not chuse you Regent  COUNT CILLEY  They shall by force elect me if not peaceably  The army shall control them in my favour  ZILUGO  Only that army which you hither brought  Ulrick you now confess what all suspected  That here your troops were station'd with design  Most hostile to this State we knew your purpose  Was not to grace the nuptials of your Niece  Though that was your pretence to gain them entrance  Yet as 'twas rumour'd that the unnumber'd host  Which Mahomet led was marching to Belgrade  Its gates were open'd to receive your forces  Unquestion'd your designs  COUNT CILLEY  And who should question them  Am I a German Prince and Austria's Regent  To move without due state lest you should frown  ZILUGO  Conceal'd ambition lures you to a plan  In which success will prove most fatal to you  I know your valour but in Europe's wars  However skill'd in Asiatic modes  Of wily fight or fierce terrific onset  Your courage and your conduct are untry'd  Your first essay in this extreme of danger  Cannot be made We must give battle soon  Or else by famine perish I am your friend  COUNT CILLEY  Let me but find you so Such vast returns  ZILUGO  Mistake me not I am your friend who warns you  To shun dishonour's gulph which yawns beneath  The mouldering precipice whose brink you tread  With such temerity Mark that I speak not  Solely to save your honour but to avoid  Intestine war to you to us unsafe  To avoid disgrace and ruin chains and slavery  Which if you lead our troops must be our fate  Then be advis'd  Enter Heralds  FIRST HERALD  Impatient to gain entrance  The Turks declare they come with terms of honour  Though our fleet burnt they might as victors come  And that provided the Hungarians  Aid not the Servian Prince and instant give  Agmunda for a bride to Mahomet  With thirty thousand ducats yearly tribute  The Sultan will consent to raise the siege  But if refus'd Belgrade he means to storm  ZILUGO  I fear some craft The Council now is met  These terms unlook'd for shall be laid before them  May Heaven direct their choice Admit the embassy  Exit Heralds  Your Austrian troops my Lord in serried files  So guard this palace and the eastern gate  We need not fear their numbers should surprise us  COUNT CILLEY  It will be well if their best services  Can make me less suspected by Zilugo  ZILUGO  My Lord will you with me the Council join▪  There your advice as Uncle to the Princess  With due respect and deference will meet  SCENE THIRD  CORVINUS COUNT CILLEY THE GOVERNOR MICHAEL ZILUGO  CORVINUS  In complete armour his casque gold the crest a raven a large plume of black feathers waving over it Speaking to an Officer as he enters  Campestran is not here In his own chapel  Or in the councilhall Ernesto seek him  Zilugo will the Council grant my prayer  Empower me to avenge or save my Father  COUNT CILLEY  We mourn his fate but must avoid to share it  CORVINUS  Matchless ingratitude Desert Huniades  So oft his Country's tutelary God  Is this the last brave battle he shall fight  ZILUGO  My Lord the Council is but just assembled  Hope in their justice for your Father's rescue  Corvinus have you heard the Turkish embassy  CORVINUS  With grief with indignation I have heard it  Peace on such terms makes us the slaves of Mahomet  The giddy people think it of advantage  And joyful shout "Our Princess will redeem us"  A Turkish marriage is most vile disgrace  We will not tamely wear the chains of Mahomet  This shameful union never shall take place  COUNT CILLEY  Speech so peremptory becomes you not  Young Lord I think compliance will be prudent  CORVINUS  Heavens to this spoiler would you give the Princess  His sword yet reeks with his Sultana's blood  This alludes to the fate of the Sultaness Irene Mahomet being told that the Janizaries and the great officers murmured that he spent  o much time in her company and were ready to revolt assembled the Divan and brought Irene before them and after severely reproaching them for daring to murmer at his attachment to her he to shew them that he was master over his affections twisted his hand in her hair which hung flowing over her shoulders and with one blow of his scimitar struck off her head to the horror and surprise of all present  KNOLLES p    Wantonly slain by his own hand to shew  His whole astonish'd court he could in cruelty  Exceed whatever monster yet debas'd  The nature or disgrac'd the name of man  Hence let us drive this fierce imperial ruffian  Or nobly perish in the just attempt  Let him the city storm it shall be sav'd  Or I will perish in its last intrenchment  Leave him of my defeat a sad memorial  A trophy which shall make my victor mourn  COUNT CILLEY  very sarcastically  For tilts and tournaments vainglorious stripling  Save idle gallantry  CORVINUS  Injurious Prince  That stripling's sword has gain'd a coat of mail  Which malice cannot pierce My past success  Warrants my present hopes  COUNT CILLEY  going out  Think not to risk  Belgrade and slaughter thousands at thy will  Exit Count Cilley  SCENE FOURTH  CORVINUS THE GOVERNOR MICHAEL ZILUGO  ZILUGO  Ulrick's ambition plans to seize the crown  But thou wilt guard it for its trembling master  CORVINUS  May Heaven forsake me when I  him  forsake  Bred up my foe yet still he is my King  And could ambition warp my sworn allegiance  A panoply invulnerable guards him  Which courage or which honour ne'er assails  Namelyhis helpless statesacred to me  As sainted shrines nor dare I to invade it  ZILUGO  O more than monarch princelyminded youth  Worthy to mount that throne thy temperance shuns  More glorious thus to guard a crown than wear it  The spirit of Huniades lives in thee  O Son most worthy of thy godlike Father  Thou know'st my heart say how I best may serve thee  CORVINUS  Haste join the assembled Council and oppose  With all your influence this hated marriage  Speak my great Father's claim to ev'ry aid  E'en to the last brave man the State can raise  Speak for a friend a patriot and a Son  With all a friend's a Son's a patriot's zeal  But should'st thou fail in these protract the council  A moment now is worth an age hereafter  ZILUGO  I to the Council will prefer your suit  To Campestran as he enters  Campestran comes Hail saintly warrior  Advise assist us in this hour of fate  To save a Throne a Kingdom and a Friend  Zilugo goes out  SCENE FIFTH  CAMPESTRAN CORVINUS  CORVINUS  Good father hast thou heard the Sultan's embassy  His arrogant demands  CAMPESTRAN  I have my son  Ernesto found me in the councilhall  Where Ulrick now harangues in praise of peace  CORVINUS  with great eagerness  Our warriors surely execrate the terms  Nor will ignobly sacrifice Agmunda  To this barbarian  CAMPESTRAN  A general panic  Has like some sudden pestilence unstrung  Each heart the icy poison of dismay  Freezes the lifeblood of their vaunted courage  Though murmuring all consent to purchase peace  To yield the Princess and to pay the tribute  CORVINUS  Curse on the unmanly spirits which desert her  We shall be chronicled to future times  For traitors cowards to devote a Princess  To slavery nay to death to ransom Us  Only from sharing in the chance of war  Our fortune ebbs but is not desperate yet  Even then our lives with loss of honour bought  Were purchas'd at a price beyond their worth  Then let us save her and prevent our shame  O father  pauses much agitated  CAMPESTRAN  Why dejected dost thou pant  Like timorous fawn caught in the snarer's toils  I know thee not thou art so fallen and spiritless  What trouble thus unnerves thee Rouse Corvinus  Collect thy thoughts Support thy present woes  With the same equal mind and dauntless courage  Thou at an army's head repell'st thy enemy  Thy grief though just should not disarm thy mind  Recall thy godlike energy of soul  Reflect on thy own fame respect thyself  Can courage aid us or can wisdom save  In every exigence they still were thine  Oft has thy valour sav'd the doubtful field  And oft thy counsel has inform'd the wise  If aught can now be done thou canst achieve it  Thy arm our bulwark and thy mind our helm  CORVINUS  Faint hope gleams on my soul but so o'ercast  With fears which like to cowardice unman me  Thus sunk through very weakness I could weep  There is one step which might avert these ills  A venturous act befits a losing cause  Recovering his spirit  These coward nobles will our honour stain  Ingrates who leave my Father to his fate  A slave or fallen unrescu'd unreveng'd  CAMPESTRAN  Where glory leads my troops thou may'st command  They are not veterans but zeal supplies  Experience Wait not the Council's orders  Lead forth my troops I by thy side will fight  Conquer or die  CORVINUS  Dost thou dislike this marriage  CAMPESTRAN  Yes as a man and Christian Canst thou think  I left my blest retreat my holy brethren  Hither to come to place a helpless lamb  Upon the altar for the cruel Turk  To immolate beneath the olive branch  Of peace held forth in treachery to blind us  Does the Crusade I preach admit such peace  Or our religion hold such nuptials holy  What is thy aim If in thy selfdesertion  Thou canst a purpose form give me to know it  CORVINUS  Oh canst thou not divine from looks my wishes  Learn from the throbbings of my heart my hopes  And from these tears of anguish that despair  Which blasts them all Wert thou but skill'd to read  My inmost soul Let me not give it speech  Unless thou father kindly wilt recall  Thy youthful ardour ere the cloyster's gloom  Chasten'd thy thoughts to dwell on Heaven alone  Love once  CAMPESTRAN  Besits this time a lover's tale  When Ulrick plots against thy fame and life  When peace alike impolitic and shameful  Thy country threats with everlasting chains  CORVINUS  To avert that peace one way alone remains  If you consent  CAMPESTRAN  Speak but the means  CORVINUS  Ah wilt thou  falters  CAMPESTRAN  Why falter thus Declare what can I do  To avert this shameful peace  CORVINUS  Persuade the Princess  To accept my vowsunite us instantly  And supersede this most unchristian sacrifice  CAMPESTRAN  'Tis the sure means to avoid this fatal peace  Hast thou a hope she will consent to this  Betroth'd to Servia's Prince who would be here  To claim her hand but for the Sultan's army  A part of which invades the Servian frontiers  Whilst he in person storms Belgrade  CORVINUS  Once highly  Was I esteem'd The fair Agmunda gave  Consent that to my Father I should tell  My love Statepolicy usurping tyrant  Over domestic bliss destroy'd my hopes  The Regent heard my suit but not the Parent  Parental love Agmunda's rigid Guardian  Now first forgot he sent me from Belgrade  The Princess by my Father's firmness aw'd  Her ductile mind won by delusive reasons  Promis'd Oh horrour by a solemn Oath  Never to wed but with his full consent  And should he die ere yet the nuptial torch  For her was lighted ne'er to wed his Son  CAMPESTRAN  Oh most unjust an oath like this to exact  Her tyrant Uncle better had become  Than our brave Chief nor ought she to have sworn it  Surely thy rank thy fame merits her hand  CORVINUS  Then good Campestran thou wilt plead my cause  CAMPESTRAN  Plead for thyself and with a lover's haste  CORVINUS  How shall I gain admission to her presence  She will not see me since her fatal oath  Though you consent I have a thousand fears  Perhaps she'll scorn me will not let me save her  Her hand is to another lover promis'd  CAMPESTRAN  This marriage with the Turk she must abhor  From his detested nuptials you redeem her  When all desert her Uncle Nobles People  Plead this and speak the hazard which your love  For her encounters  CORVINUS  Should my generosity  Appear beyond my love I meet repulse  Great souls from obligations nobly fly  She must be won ere she has time to think  Herself oblig'd  CAMPESTRAN  Take courage son her love  You merit In my chapel dormitory  Behind the altar of the palace church  I'll wait your coming and there join your hands  Then will I gird you with that blessed Sword  There plac'd in trust upon that sacred altar  That Sword which Ulrick has in vain demanded  Farewell An old man's half prophetic zeal  Foretells a cause so just will meet success  CORVINUS  Transporting thought Agmunda for my bride  Grant me to save my Father and my Country  And make the measure of my bliss complete  Exeunt separately  End of the First Act  Act Second  SCENE FIRSTA CHURCH  The platform of the high altar raised a step above the floor of the church and of sufficient breadth for any body to walk upon it without coming to the edge of the step which is covered with crimson cloth A large altar table covered with crimson velvet fringed with gold At the back of the altar over the table a luminous Cross under which hangs a magnificent Sword suspended from a rich belt On each side of the altar upon the raised platform footstools covered like the altar table The Princess Agmunda kneeling upon the footstool on the south side or left hand of the altar  PRINCESS  alone  IF for its sins THOU visitest this land  Destroy it not in wrath O let the wings  Of mercy shield us from thy dread displeasure  If we must suffer be it from thy hand  Give us not up to our bloodthirsty foes  But grant us strength and courage to withstand them  Defeat their stratagems confound their counsels  And aid thy servant who now fights our cause  SCENE SECOND  THE PRINCESS ELLA  PRINCESS  Descending from the altar and coming forward as soon as Ella enters  Is the fight over Is our fleet victorious  Why this long interval without intelligence  ELLA  The anxious multitude have so beset  The watchtower that your messengers can scarce  Pass through the throng  PRINCESS  But what account bring'st thou  ELLA  I must conceal the news    aside    Corvinus wishes  PRINCESS  I will not hearHave I not oft conjured thee  For my mind's peace to speak that name no more  Duty commands that I forget our loves  All thoughts of him whenever they obtrude  Must unapprov'd undwelt on be dismiss'd  O ceaseless anguish Ere I chase one thought  Another and another torturing comes  Mocking my best resolves  ELLA  Corvinus begs  That you would see him now  PRINCESS  To bring this message  Was wrong and although check'd again to speak it  Argues unfriendliness tempting to crime  Ella thou knew'st I dar'd not see Corvinus  ELLA  Forgive me Yet his wretchedness so struck me  That ere my judgment weigh'd my heart was won  To pity his distress and tell his suit  PRINCESS  Rash thoughtless that thou art to be thus won  To tempt my soul If thou could'st not resist  His sorrows how shall I be proof against them  Injur'd Corvinus I destroy thy peace  I dare not see thee more for should'st thou sue  And plead despair might urge my tortur'd soul  To violate the unjust the guilty Oath  Which I in bitterness of heart repent  Ye soft ideas Ye illusive hopes  Of love and bliss begone Assail me not  Whatever joys fate had reserv'd for me  Thriftless I mortgag'd ere possession came  The ruinous payment beggars future hours  Oh to forget for thoughts of happier prospects  Embitter misery  ELLA  Yet see Corvinus  Somewhat of moment has he to impart  Which it imports you instantly to learn  PRINCESS  Forbear 'Tis virtue bids me shun the conflict  Tell him I cannot see him I'm at the altar  Imploring Heaven's protection for my Country  I am its victimSay not that to him  Exit Ella  A voluntary wretch I made myself  Alas ere my heart knew how much it lov'd  Why did I swear for ever to renounce him  Aid me kind heaven against this rooted passion  Assist me to forget this dear Corvinus  SCENE THIRD  THE PRINCESS CORVINUS  CORVINUS  entering his Casque in his hand  Heaven hear her not but now two faithful hearts  Reward  PRINCESS  turning from Corvinus  Why is this trying moment come  CORVINUS  kneeling  Agmunda bless the lover who adores you  And pitying end his woes When last we parted  PRINCESS  We parted then for ever Rise my Lord  He rises  It was not well to invade this holy place  When my sad heart was communing with Heaven  The affianc'd bride of brave Matthias grieves  That you should dare infringe the sacred mound  Of female delicacy wounding her soul  By searching out those secret inmost sentiments  Which duty time and absence will o'ercome  On earth we meet no more Regard this moment  As if from awful summons thou stood near  The deathbed of a soon departing friend  Let my  Request  I solemnly adjure thee  As if it were that dying friend's Request  Be sacred held My Brother is thy King  Take no advantage of the People's love  Remain his  Subject  Then to her last of life  With sisterly affection will Agmunda  Remember thee Farewellresignforget me  Honour and Fame demand the sacrifice  Goes towards the altar Corvinus follow  her she stops and again comes forward  CORVINUS  To call thee mine is the first honour which  My soul desires Alas I once had hopes  That the sweet dreams of childhood were not false  PRINCESS  Ah flattering dreams they fled with infancy  Inexorable fate has seal'd our doom  Nor leaves one hope of happier days to cheer us  But virtue still is left us midst our woes  Then let us summon courage to sustain them  As virtue bids  CORVINUS  Heaven first of each perfection  Must thee deprive ere I with courage can  PRINCESS  Thy duties all command it Think Corvinus  Reflect on all the reasons duties claims  Thy Father wisely urg'd when he forbad thee  Ever to hope my hand Chaste honour conscience  Filial obedience a patriot's duty  And sacred friendship's debt of gratitude  Have plac'd their adamantine bars against  Thy love Respect my peace forbear thy suit  CORVINUS  Thy heart can plead for every claim but mine  My love is sacrific'd to raise thy glory  Be songs of triumph thine  PRINCESS  Unjust Corvinus  Accuse me not of such vainglorious pride  My rank demands the sacrifice I make  The subject's fealty claims the Prince's love  To the State's interest I am now devote  To insure its happiness my own is yielded  A Nation's welfare and my Brother's safety  Bade me forego the choice my heart had made  'Twas reason's dictate and made honour's law  By the strong Oath exacted by thy Father  To spotless honour sacred be that Oath  Let thy firm soul resist its present feelings  Reproach me not Alas I know thy woes  I I inflict them but I more than share them  CORVINUS  My anguish canst thou feel and yet persist  Let thy relenting pity end my torments  PRINCESS  Seek not to melt my heart to vain repentance  The motives which impell'd forbid retreat  CORVINUS  Obdurate Princess Thou hast never lov'd  PRINCESS  Leave me To see thee thus distress'd Corvinus  Adds to the conflict of my tortur'd soul  Spare spare my grief I agonize at thine  All dearer ties forgetthink me thy sister  And urge my duties with a Brother's sternness  CORVINUS  Oh has thy heart no pity for my sufferings  Forgive the boldness of despair Thou must  Be mine  He seizes her hand wildly and draws her further from the altar  PRINCESS  Add not thy phrensy to my woes  I pity I esteem I Oh release me  Endeavours to withdraw her hand  My hand cannot be thine My Oath forbids it  CORVINUS  Wilt thou not hazard something to redeem me  PRINCESS  All All but truth and honour these I dare not  Strive not to make me hateful to myself  Oh what can I to mitigate thy grief  CORVINUS  Let pity plead be generous be just  Recall my doom and save thyself sweet excellence  From our curs'd foe from treacherous savage Mahomet  Who now insulting claims thee for his bride  PRINCESS  Detested thought  CORVINUS  Prevent the hell I must  Endure to see thee in base Mahomet's arms  Think what the rage of madness and despair  Might make me do against us both  PRINCESS  No more  I never will consent to such a sacrifice  Oh dire dishonour wed a Turk a murderer  An Infidel who Christian rites abhors  When was this fatal proposition made  CORVINUS  Even now Ambassadors attend the Council  Demanding tribute and thy hand in marriage  For price of peace with their inhuman master  And they will take thee hence this very day  Unless thou give me sacred right to claim thee  The coward Council all desert thy cause  Except myself Campestran and Zilugo  They are unanimous sway'd by thy Uncle  Basely to yield thee to this savage Prince  PRINCESS  The people will not I'll appeal to them  Invoke their justice and implore their pity  Let rank and proud prerogative desert me  My Uncle scorn defame oppress insult me  Still fearless will I urge my freeborn right  And whilst with conscious virtue glows my breast  As suff'ring now in their and honour's cause  What more I fear'd Heaven knows than death itself  I will dare hope that worthy generous hearts  Will not be steel'd when helpless woman pleads  Though human nature hastily may err  And with rash judgment to oppression lean  Mercy and Justice for a while be husti'd  Their heavenly voice will not be silenc'd long  But like the glorious Sun will burst the cloud  Dispel the storm and with more radiance shine  A people truly brave are kind and just  They will protect me till thy father comes  CORVINUS  Thy Uncle's emissaries sap their fealty  Easily led they to the palace fly  In crowds and think this marriage their sole hope  PRINCESS  Has Heaven withdrawn its attributes from man  Mercy and Justice are they fled from earth  Inhuman people To devote me thus  To such a wretch A more than Moloch Sacrifice  Let bold rebellion rear its fiendlike arm  Belie the sacred oath of its allegiance  And immolate that blood it swore to guard  My life their swords may take but to this marriage  Never will I consent nor be the victim  Of a peace inglorious and unsafe  A peace that would dethrone my infant Brother  And for his kingdom forge eternal chains  Which crafty Mahomet as my right would claim  No with the dauntless spirit of my race  With firmness will I meet the coming storm  'Tis but to dieand for his Prince's welfare  Bravely each soldier death defies shall I  With a dear Brother's cause conjoin'd dare less  Than the poor peasant for my anointed King  Leave me alone to meet my dubious fate  And in thy turn abandon me Corvinus  From coward nobles an ungrateful people  From an insidious Uncle take example  CORVINUS  Honour and love forbid me to obey thee  Campestran sanctifies by his consent  The only means that can from slavery save us  When duty pleads my cause can love be silent  Is there no gentle voice that moves thy heart  To pity and reward my tried affection  PRINCESS  My hand to thee would be a fatal gift  My Uncle seeks thine and thy Father's ruin  He envies your high fame and dreads your power  Were we united some perfidious act  In which the illtutor'd King might blindly join  Would for the victim of his hatred mark thee  And thou might'st fall or else to guard thy life  Thy sword must be unsheath'd against thy Sovereign  Perhaps the crown thou from his brow might'st tear  CORVINUS  Canst thou suspect my faith All that I ought  To promise here I swear Thy Brother's Throne  His sacred Person and his Rights inviolate  My sword and life shall guard Myself I must  Protect but if I ever pass the bounds  Of selfdefence against him then may'st thou  May Heaven desert me may its vengeance strike me  And by that hand which twofold power would give it  Draws a dagger from his bosom  By thineTake this my honest pledge of faith  If I invade thy Brother's Rights or wink  When aught invades them plunge it in my heart  He offers the dagger the Princess turns aside and retires a step he still offers the daggers  O trust my zeal my honour and my loyalty  Reward my faithful love or be this night  The Tyrant's Bride  PRINCESS  walking from Corvinus  What ought I to resolve  I shrink with terrour from a fate so cruel  What to avoid or what to choose I know not  Returning to Corvinus  I know thy love and I will trust thy honour  Corvinus I accept this horrid pledge  Takes the dagger  If thou betray thy King know in my right  Thou ne'er shalt wear his crown Great Albert's Daughter  Will use this dagger as her Father ought  Against herself the  Accomplice  of thy crime  If she should fail to guard his infant Son  For giving Thee the power to shake his Throne  She puts the dagger into her bosom  CORVINUS  I wish no empire but Agmunda's heart  My love my bride sweet source of ev'ry joy  My soul exults that thou at last art mine  Devoted to thy cause my zeal and loyalty  Shall show the rapturous gratitude I feel  This instant must we plight our mutual faith  Corvinus opens the door on the North side of the altar speaking to Campestian who comes forward  Campestran waits to join our hands Good father▪  SCENE FOURTH  THE PRINCESS CORVINUS CAMPESTRAN  PRINCESS  Campestran holy man do thou direct me  CAMPESTRAN  May heaven direct us for our good and guide  Our erring minds to what is best Your hands  I will consent to join Thy unjust Oath  And thy pledg'd faith to Servia's brave Prince  I own are obstacles against these nuptials  But I so much abhor a human sacrifice  And such thou must be to the faithless Mahomet  That I dare urge thy marriage with Corvinus  Rome's Pontiff will absolve thy breach of Oath  Rash was the vow unjust was its exaction  Huniades has err'd through over zeal  Which should have met rejection not compliance  The Princess weeps much agitated  This deep distress is thy own act and deed  The Council's sitting cannot be prolong'd  Your Uncle loudly calls for its decision  Which well he knows will be to yield you up  To supererrogate has been thy fault  This Oath no duty could require thou having  Thy freewill fetter'd hast but choice of evil  Choosewed this Turk your life your faith endanger  Or break your oath and be this Hero's Bride  Campestran takes her hand and gives it to Corvinus  Corvinus she is yours Lead to the altar  PRINCESS  Retreating from Corvinus and withdrawing her hand  Lead to some altar where light never gleams  Befitting oaths that sinfully are sworn  This is no altar for our vows Here Heaven  With all its hosts of Angels Saints and Martyrs  Witness'd my promise "never to be thine"  Pointing to the altar  Should I approach yon awful shrine that sword  Some Angel's vengeful arm would raise to strike me  For breaking thus my Oath to thy stern Father  CAMPESTRAN  Going to the altar takes down the magnificent Sword which hangs at the front of the altar under the luminous cross  This Sword I had reserv'd for great Huniades  Rome's holy Pontiff sent it forth to arm  Our Chief in the Crusade against curs'd Mahomet  Now champion of our cause I hail Corvinus  CORVINUS  taking the sword  The sacred pledge with reverence I receive  And I will wield it with no common zeal  Oh may supernal power my arm invigorate  And be our cause invincible as holy  CAMPESTRAN  to the Princess  Let us this altar quit since it excites  Thy fears My chapel through the dormitory  Is more retir'd We might be here surpriz'd  Speed to reward this hero with thy hand  And from a lawless tyrant save thyself  Hither return nor sanctuary quit  Except with us Here let the Council find thee  PRINCESS  Must I be left to meet my Uncle's rage  CAMPESTRAN  This altar from his violence protects thee  Here then remain and when the dastard nobles  To yield thee come declare thou art espous'd  Acknowledge if occasion call to whom  Thy hand is given War's various toils demand  Elsewhere our presence Corvinus and myself  Must to the troops declare his happy fortune  The soldiers love they idolize Corvinus  Their joy the echoing people soon will catch  And make their own they will applaud thy choice  PRINCESS  I dread the event the people are against me  CORVINUS  Dismiss thy fears the people still adore thee  E'en whilst their terrour to desert thee leads them  All will be well I shall return triumphant  To guard my Princess and my charming Bride    Campestran goes through the altar door by which he entered Corvinus follows h  m leading the Princess    End of the Second Act  Act Third

PRINCESS  I never will accept that hated title  COUNT CILLEY  The People Council and I Princess will it  And your reluctance to our power must yield  PRINCESS  Nor you nor they my Lord shall thus

implore her  PRINCESS  By you they should be sav'd and I protected  The man who will not risk his life to save  His wife his children and his native land  Has lost great Nature's first best energies

That ere the echo of one victory ceases  Fame's oftswell'd trump proclaims another conquest  FIRST LORD  No longer have we hope in great Huniades  His Fleet is now in flames and all is lost  PRINCESS  with surprise and agitation  Heavens did I hear thee right The Fleet in flames  Where is Huniades  To Zilugo  ZILUGO  Slain say the Turks  As sword in hand first in the fight he leap'd  Upon the deck of their great Admiral  PRINCESS  Alas my more than Parent other griefs  Defraud thee of thy due O sainted spirit  Look down forgive me pity my distress  SCENE FOURTH  THE PRINCESS MICHAEL ZILUGO THE LORDS OF THE COUNCIL  A numerous crowd of People and Soldiers COUNT CILLEY in the midst of them burst open the great doors of the Church in the side scene on the Sou  h side of the altar The Princess on this alarm aga  kneels and extends her right arm upon the  table  PRINCESS  with terrour and distress  Oh can I hope to find this Altar sacred  When I myself have daringly profan'd it  Why are ye thus tumultuously assembled  And with licentious disrespect how dare ye  With force profane pollute this Sanctuary  OLD OFFICER    amongst the foremost of the people    To supplicate our Princess to redeem us  To beg her mercy in this hour of woe  PRINCESS    with extreme anguish rising    Oh would to Heaven that I had power to save you  OLD OFFICER  O Princess You and You alone can save us  Your godlike Father's and your Grandfire's battles  I've toil'd to win in many a hardfought field  But never saw I such unequal war  As threats us now  PRINCESS  The valour of our troops  So oft victorious shall conquer still  OLD OFFICER  Bootless is valour 'gainst unnumber'd legions  Our succours are cut off our Regent lost  Soon must the Turk be master of our walls  Think of this city sack'd given up a prey  To cruel lustful soldiers drunk with victory  Nothing but Hell with all its Fiends unchain'd  Can be so dreadful The old man's groan halfbutcher'd  Dragg'd by the hair from out the victor's path  The infant's plaintive cry and the shrill shriek  Of helpless virgins then must strike your ear  Such scenes of carnage meet your eyes as nature  Shudders to view dire miseries unknown  Save where stern War fixes his iron seat  PRINCESS  Fight gracious Heaven our cause  OLD OFFICER  Agmunda Heaven  Vouchsafes to you alone the power to save us  Could all our lives redeem you from this marriage  Freely each Youth each Veteran would bleed  But from the Sultan's power they cannot save you  And if they cannot save why should they fall  Will thy own woes be less if thousands share them  Belgrade in flames a People massacred  A Kingdom lost would these be consolations  'Tis not in us to mitigate thy fate  Then nobly bear it shield us from destruction  Ransom the Throne of thy renown'd Forefathers  Ransom our matrons virgins helpless infants  Ransom thy native Land from desolation  PRINCESS  Can life that ransom pay I will consent  To suffer any death unmov'd will meet it  With patient firmness and my blood pour forth  A free libation in your heartfelt cause  I love my Father's and my Brother's Subjects  And I should glory in that Death which saves them    In a lowered voice with fear and horrour    ButI can never wed this savage Infidel  COUNT CILLEY  Inhuman Princess wilt thou then decree  Half our brave citizens to death the rest  To be driven forth to distant lands and sold  For slaves  PRINCESS  Seek not to aggravate my fate  I am most wretched  COUNT CILLEY  pointing to the people    Think what then are these  Who supplicate thy mercy View thy victims  This City for three days thou doom'st to pillage  To rapine fire and the destructive sword  For such are Mahomet's compacts with his soldiers  Pointing to the Nobles  Turn here and view the fourth day's sacrifice  For Mahomet then Belgrade in triumph enters  To take his Spoil when to a bloody banquet  In chains these Nobles with their wives and children  Before the insulting Victor will be dragg'd  And there with barbarous taunts midst revelling  And minstrelsy will be with study'd cruelty  Mangled and slain to crown the savage feast  Constantinople thus this Sultan enter'd  Nor spar'd the Imperial Race of Constantine  They at his first infernal banquet bled  And at succeeding feasts the Grecian Nobles  Were slaughter'd in cold bloodnor found a grave  FIRST LORD  'Tis from no common fate we beg redemption  When such a peerless Victim we must yield  Peace on such terms brings tears and mourning with it  And not rejoicing Thy great soul Agmunda  Is equal to this godlike deed of mercy  To wed this Tyrant and redeem a people  Be greatly worthy of thy royal race  Be more than thy Imperial Fathers were  O be the Guardian Genius of thy Country  Save with Belgrade the whole Hungarian Realm  If once the Turk be master of this City  Hungaria is no more Then Princess save us    When the first Lord has done speaking the people kneel The Lords of the Council their hands crossed on their breasts bend forward with supplicating solemnitya pause    PRINCESS    with a voice halfsuppressed by tears    O riseMy soul feels all your woes The fate  Which threatens you freezes my heart with horrour  Oh were but this my funeral hour and all  Your tears for me alone    Falters    I plead for mercy  I claim protection from this holy Altar    Kneels at the altar as before    O People do not violate its sanctity    Weeping    Give me not up by force to this destroyer  OLD OFFICER  Have royal tears more power to melt than ours  Or is not pity in a princely breast  Assailable by common woes We plead  For thousands you reject our supplications  And were we hard of heart to think of force  You clasp an altar and prevent the deed  At thought of sacrilege we tremble Princess  But when fierce Mahomet comes then can no church  Protect no holy altar guard no tears  Though Saints should shed them save you from his power  Since you must suffer doom not thousands with you  PRINCESS  'Twould be an action worthy of my Race  To prop a tottering Throne redeem a People  Myself the sole sad victim of misfortune    Pauses from terrour almost breathless    This glorious sacrificeI cannot make  Alas devoted People 'tis too late    Wringing her hands and weeping    I am a Wife    The People retreat a few steps back as terrified making a confused noise of sorrow    OLD OFFICER  Then we are lost indeed  Our succours are cut off our Regent fallen  Our King is fled our Princess too deserts us  Let us return to our sad homes Not long  They will be ours for desolation

Myself  COUNT CILLEY  Who is thy paramour Declare  PRINCESS  I will not answer this licentious mode  Of disrespectful speech  COUNT CILLEY  But thou shalt answer it  Hast thou so vilely cast thyself away  Hast thou so low descended that thou blushest  To own thy choice before this injur'd People  PRINCESS    with great dignity and firmness    A Hero from his cradle known to fame  His country's honour and her best support  Pride of her councils victor in her wars  The soul of justice and the arm of power  Him has my heart selected for its lord  Him do I glory to esteem and love  To him

the Princess Zilugo half draws his sword    That woman seize unless she now declare  What wretch is rais'd to trample on your necks  That ye may piecemeal scatter his vile limbs  Then she to Mahomet shall your ransom be  Speak for that shrine shall not protect thee silent  Perhaps thy coward Brother who is fled  Clings to some altar too The King who can  Desert his throne from all allegiance frees  The People he dissolves their compact with him  And they may choose a King whose heart can feel  Their woes whose arm can succour their distress  Who in their utmost need will not desert them  SOME OF THE PEOPLE  Let Ulrick be our King  ZILUGO    with anger to the People    We have a King  He who bereaves his Crown shall feel my justice    The Lords half draw their swords as approving what Zilugo says    My sword shall strike him though he were Count Cilley  Hemm'd in by thousands singly I'd oppose him  SOME OF THE PEOPLE  Our King deserts us  COUNT CILLEY    to the People    I will save you still  Assert yourselves and all your foes shall tremble    To the Princess    Speak I command thee and declare thy partner  In this complotted treason which demands  A punishment condign on thee and him  PRINCESS  Art thou Count Cilley Surely some base impostor  Beneath his name thus loudly bawls sedition  Excites revolt and tempts to foulest murder  You whom the States chose Guardian to their King  Because his Uncle have their choice dishonour'd  They hop'd to train a tender vine around  A healthy parent elm but when the tendrils  Of the young plant shoot curling up to climb  They clasp a wither'd branch which treacherous snapping  Yields no support but lets it fall to ruin  Now when my Brother wants your aid and counsel  When I might have found comfort from your friendship  Oh you forsake defame and plot against us  False to your trust rebellious to your Prince  To your own blood a traitor I disclaim you  O'er me my Lord henceforth▪ you have no power  COUNT CILLEY  I'll shew thee that I have and courage too  To execute a speedy vengeance on thee  Speak give thy vile seducer to our wrath  Or with that Sword which Rome's great Pontiff sent  To guard our cause I'll sacrifice thee here  As excommunicate as one unhallow'd  To whom an Altar's sanctity extends not  Count Cilley advances to the step of the platform Zilugo draws his sword advances up the step and stands before the altar table The Lords of the Council draw their swords  ZILUGO  Ulrick that Sword is here in trust 'tis sacrilege  To seize it  PRINCESS  That sacred Sword my Husband wears  And your ambitious hand shall never grasp it  You are my Brother's Subject In his absence  If you rebel and prove disloyal to him  Know that in ME resides my Father's spirit  Call'd forth it shall invigorate my soul  And Albert's fearless Daughter shall protect  His infant Son whilst she has life or friend  Upon the throne of his Imperial Fathers  Your house was honour'd by their high alliance  But when my Grandsire wedded with your Sister  You were Count Cilley still no royal blood  Flows in your veins to give a right to Empire    To the People    My friends this is no time for civil broils  Concord and union are the arms of safety  Pointing to her Uncle  You are my hope 'gainst this unnatural foe  O be yourselves the Guardians of your Princes  We are the last of our Imperial Race  Protect the offspring of your ancient Kings  Let each brave man think Albert's Son his own  Then feel how sacred is his Monarch's cause  COUNT CILLEY  to the People  Has not your coward Monarch left his throne  At rumour only of the Turks' invasion  Will you brave Men support a dastard Prince  Who flies to prison rather than share your danger  PRINCESS  Malicious slanderer 'Tis true O citizens  Your King is fled His Uncle and his Guardian  Should telling this have told his tender Youth  Fear is the state of childhood not its crime  Your Monarch by his future deeds of fame  Shall gloriously retrieve this childish flight  Efface from memory's record this stain  And emulate the Race from which he springs  People and Peers be guardians of his Throne  As ye would wish your children should in peace

to the Princess  We glory in your choice And had we not  A lawful Prince all here I know would think  Corvinus worthy of Hungaria's throne  OLD OFFICER  to the Council  My Lords we ask Corvinus for our Regent  For him we will submit to war's dread hazard  We'll fight like lions for our brave young Chief  And trust some miracle from Heaven shall save us  ZILUGO  May favouring Heaven now grant its

and place you in the Castle  This quarter of the City is unsafe  Your Uncle's troops command it much I fear  That his mad rage bent on revenge and power  Will to some act of desperation tempt him    The Princess returns to the altar the Governor and Council go out the scene closes    End of the Third Act  Act Fourth  SCENE FIRSTTHE TENT OF MAHOMET  A magnificent Tent occupying the greatest part of the stage in width its form circular The outer tent forming a hall of audience Two doors at the back of the tent conducting to the interior part of it In the middle between the two doors a splendid Throne with a canopy over it the drapery of the canopy hanging from a large crescent representing gems At each side of the tent near the front a rich sofa The side scenes about the tent trees The scene behind the tent the Turkish Camp a crescent on the top of each tent  The scene drawing discovers Mustapha seated on one of the sofas An Aga enters the tent holding his right hand motionless on his breast according to the Turkish manner of salutation  AGA  CHUSANES waits without  MUSTAPHA  Conduct him hither  Exit Aga  SCENE SECOND  MUSTAPHA CHUSANES  CHUSANES  Impatient of my messenger's delay  I come before he brings me leave of audience  MUSTAPHA  You will not gain it yet for disappointment  Rage and revenge possess the Sultan's soul  By turns His pride is wounded at the thought  Of that disgrace his fame will now sustain  Unless Belgrade should fall by storm or stratagem  Now whilst he vents his rage he will not see you  CHUSANES  My orders from his Highness are imperfect  And I suspect the business of this night  Teems with no common danger to our arms  Why does he now negotiate for this Princess  MUSTAPHA  If she be gain'd these Christian Dogs will rest  Secure of peace and when they find our Fleet  Was burnt but to molest Huniades  They will impute this marriage to our fears  They will exult but when in midnight wine  Supine they're drown'd and unprepar'd to meet us  Then shall we thunder at their halfarm'd walls  With all our mighty war at once assault  And level their high towers ere they have time  To weep their falling  CHUSANES  Should they this intent  Suspect and much I fear they will we're caught  In our own toils This policy may fail  They may refuse the Princess to our Sultan  Then great advantage does this parley give them  Ere we can storm Huniades may land  Though half our host is gone to stop this Christian  But what are legions 'gainst this favour'd mortal  Whose prophet sends him signs and prodigies  The bad success of the enterprise against Belgrade was attributed to the appearance of two Comets on the concluding days of that memorable Sie  e See D'Ohsson's Hist Gen of the Othoman Empire vol I p    To affright and terrify the stoutest hearts  Our soldiers tremble at his hated Voice  'Tis as the blast of Israfel's  See Sale's Translation of the KORAN  dread Trump  To their astonish'd ears They fly before him  With the same fatal speed as will the accursed  Over the swordedg'd Sirat † when fallen Eblis †  Despairing drives them Our selected men  Even the Oglani I beheld at Vascape  Desert our mighty Prophet's holy standard  By Christian hands defil'd led on to havock  By fierce Huniades who o'er fourscore thousand  Of the brave Faithful there exulting triumph'd  And with a puny army far less numerous  Than our great Sultan's train  The Sultan Amurath had seven thousand Falconers and seven thousand Huntsmen and at the head of ten thousand men Huniades defeated the whole Turkish army commanded by Amurath in person At Vascape at the head of fifteen thousand men he defeated an army of eighty thousand Turks and for this signal victory Te Deum was sung for three days throughout Hungary  when in the field  To unbend his mind he takes his hunting sport  MUSTAPHA  Victorious Mahomet now leads the Faithful  Shall this Belgrade resist that mighty arm  Which raz'd Imperial Constantine's proud towers  CHUSANES  Another destiny now frowning threats us  Our Fleet was burnt but to prevent its capture  And if the Christians thinking it their fleet  Should yield to peace our standard from their towers  May wave yet if our terms should be refus'd  The event is doubtful they can still defy us  What 'vantage by a month's blockade is gain'd  If at this time they knew but their own strength  What shall we gain The Christian Dervis aids them  Corvinus too that Son of fierce Huniades  In strength and years our youthful Sultan's peer  Is in Belgrade his fame and courage equal  His veteran Sire'sWhat hope of conquest then  O'er Men whom singly we have found invincible  Their valour claims that victory which Heaven  To them predestinates In vain we strive  We cannot stem the tide nor stand its force  Will you not tell the Sultan that his slave  Waits for his further orders  MUSTAPHA  As my life  I value in his present mood I dare not  Venture unsummon'd to appear before him  "Let none approach me till Zoganus comes"  Were his commands  CHUSANES  One privileg'd like you  Might in such exigence dispense with orders  And disobey the injunctions passion gave  You are the only man who can control him  MUSTAPHA  I never dar'd but once  See Knolles p  nor dare I now  It were as safe to face the cannon's mouth  When its fierce blast sends forth pernicious deaths  As seek the Sultan in his ireful mood  Alas his passions know no wholesome bounds  Nature has left her noblest work imperfect  In mighty Mahomet's splendid savage soul  SCENE THIRD  MAHOMET MUSTAPHA CHUSANES    Mahomet enters from the left hand door of the inner tent Chusanes prostrates himself Mustapha offers to retire    MAHOMET  Mustapha stay    To Chusanes    Rise slave    To Mustapha    What no Zoganus  Is there no messenger  MUSTAPHA  Great Sultan no  MAHOMET  Curse on his tardiness and negligence  Which disappoint my hopes and keep my soul  In this suspense  MUSTAPHA  He doubtless waits to come  In greater pomp and bring the Princess forth  In state attended by her Lords and Chiefs  MAHOMET  Hah say'st thou soBe they as princes feasted  Till night has thrown her starry mantle o'er  Our warring hosts    To Chusanes    Then give them chains not death  Belgrade shall be their ransom they my hostages  Soul of my Father Amurath I swear  The affront thy arms sustain'd from this proud City  Thy Son shall see aveng'd This fierce Huniades  Who drove thee hence with shame and fell defeat  Shall round thy tomb be dragg'd a second Hector  Curse on his glory it obscures my own  Though giant terrour's self stalks in my van  And bows the trembling Nations ere I strike  Yet he resists the conqueror of the East  Stops my career and bids my fame stand still  By force or stratagem Belgrade shall yield  And suffer for this obstinate resistance  For all the pangs my wounded pride has felt  For all I still may feel should dismal overthrow  Disgrace my armsI will not think it can  For if I do I shall grow mad with rage  MUSTAPHA  If this strong City can be overthrown  You gain the Realm of which it is the key  Surely they'll give their Princess to our Emperor  MAHOMET  But I must send and sue for this Agmunda  I who had will'd amidst the smoking ruins  Of proud Belgrade as royal spoil to seize her  I fear these Christian Dogs are not deceiv'd  And that they know the blazing fleet is mine  But yet Belgrade thy towers shall kiss the ground  MUSTAPHA  All that men dare attempt your troops will do  Inspir'd and aided by your great example  MAHOMET  Chusanes have our orders been obey'd  And does each Chieftain know his post of honour  Is all in readiness to storm the City  CHUSANES  All that the mighty Sultan has commanded  And his Slave waits to know his further orders  MAHOMET  Let fires throughout the camp ready for midnight  Be prepar'd Plant the ordnance 'gainst the postern  North of the Eastern tower for there I deem  The wall is most assailable Let Tura  Lead on the main assault and his worst troops  First climb the scaling ladders To the left  Let Isa Beg lead on the Tartar slaves  To the command of that brave veteran Cali  Appoint five thousand chosen Janizaries  To back the assault and drive the caitiffs on  He dies who turns his back or breaks the ranks  CHUSANES  What is the signal for our troops to leave  The outer camp  MAHOMET  The word be "  Mahomet  "  Let all in silence march without the lines  And then from host to host the word be "  Amurath  "  And instant let the cover'd fires blaze forth  To light them to their fame Tomorrow tell them  Ere the Sun gilds the East their conquering Sultan  Bearing the holy Prophet's sacred standard  Will view their glorious deeds and aid their prowess  Should any dire mishap o'ertake our purpose  Let "  Duma  " be the word to spread the alarm  Within yon Grove see my rearguard be posted  Be my ten thousand troops all night in arms  That if aught intervene before day dawns  Worthy my Sword all may be ready for me  CHUSANES  Say what reward shall victory bring the Faithful  MAHOMET  Three days I give the Town to their sole pillage  With power of life and death o'er ev'ry citizen  And to each Captain choice of twenty slaves  Amongst their Merchants But their Princely Nobles  For me and my Bashaws must be reserv'd  Now send a summons to the City walls  To know why our Ambassadors are thus  Detain'd    Chusanes goes out and instantly  as meeting Zoganus he conducts him in and then retires▪    SCENE FOURTH  MAHOMET MUSTAPHA ZOGANUS  ZOGANUS  prostrating himself  Great Sultan  MAHOMET  signing to him to rise  Instant give your tidings  Did the Foe think the burning Fleet was theirs  ZOGANUS  They did dread Sultan and such consternation  As their looks shew'd I never saw before  The Governor receiv'd your gracious message  With much dislike though he oppos'd the Council  Acceded to your terms Count Cilley sway'd them  They went▪ in form to bring the Princess to us  Long time we waited in the audiencehall  Back came Count Cilley passion shook his frame  Aside he took me "We're betray'd" said he  "Take your dismission peaceably retire  "When your first troops have reach'd the City gate  "Halt and expect your just revenge from me  "Let that commend me to your Sultan's friendship"  MAHOMET  DispatchWhat means this manyworded mystery  ZOGANUS  Then came the Council and with thanks dismiss'd us  The Princess had just own'd herself the Wife  Of bold Corvinus  MAHOMET  in a rage  How said'st thou his Wife  Corvinus' Wife This Father and this Son  Cast a more deadly shade upon my glory  Than curs'd Al Zackum  See Sale's Translation of the KORAN  on Hell's barren plain  ZOGANUS  Sultan you triumph over both  MAHOMET  half drawing his sabre  Peace Slave  On thy life say not I triumph In love  Revenge and glory they impede my course  But for their swords my conquests had outstripp'd  The victories of mighty Alexander  Alexander and Julius Caesar were the models which Mahomet strove to imitate Homer Quintius Curtius and Caesar's Commentaries were his favourite studies He was master of all the learning of his time and understood six or seven different languages At this period he was in the twentyfifth year of his age    Ere at his age arriv'd the world had own'd  Me for its Lord supreme for like young Ammon  The world alone can bound my daring views  But these Hungarian Chiefs arrest my speed  Else like the first intrepid godlike Caesar  Mahomet too had  come  and  seen  and  conquer'd  Swifter than Fame had she ten thousand tongues  Could speak his deeds The haughty Eastern Empire  In ruin lies beneath my feet I'll reap  Like harvest in the West  Immortal Caesar  In thy  Imperial Rome  I will be crown'd  This through life was Mahomet's ambition and he would have accomplished it had he not been killed at the siege of Otranto in Italy    I'll plant the Crescent where thy Eagles soar'd  And conquer Worlds to rule upon thy Throne  ZOGANUS  O mighty Sultan wilt thou hear thy Slave  MAHOMET  Yes if thou canst but make me know I triumph  O'er these aspiring Men Gods that such Heroes  Worthy to cope with Me and cross my fortune  Should fight for a boy King a coward boy  If they be fallen then speak if not away  Away for my chafed soul is rous'd and thirsts  To wreak its vengeance Speak say If I triumph  O'er these destructive foes And if I do  Strikes his forehead  By heaven I grieveThere's not a Hero left  Worthy to meet my prowess in the field  If these be overthrown  Mahomet said this when informed of the death of Huniades    ZOGANUS  Hear first my tale  Then Sultan of your triumph judge  MAHOMET  Proceed  ZOGANUS  We halted at the city gate A man  Of noble port advanc'd "Count Cilley sends me  Follow"We did and to a Temple close  Bordering upon the inner rampart wall  He led us Kneeling at an Altar there  Alone we saw a beauteous female form  "That" said the stranger "is Count Cilley's gift  "To Mahomet That is his Niece the Princess"  MAHOMET  drawing his sabre  Is she my conquest Slave Else by this sword  Thou art but dust  Zoganus terrified kneels  ZOGANUS  Dread Emperor she is  Mahomet with his sabre motioning to him to rise he rises  Weeping and trembling hither she approaches  When our whole train had pass'd the city gate  Corvinus fell upon our rear I left  The skirmish to the conduct of Mesetes  Whilst I with your fair prize the trenches gain'd  Corvinus still maintains the fight I saw  His towering helmet glittering midst our troops  MAHOMET    to Mustapha    Mesetes may want aid see to the field  Exit Mustapha  Enter an Aga  AGA    to Zoganus    Abdalla sends to say the female prisoner  Waits at the outside of his Highness' guard  MAHOMET  Bid him conduct her to our presence instantly    Exit Aga    Thou hast thy master's thanks for this good service    Exit Zoganus    SCENE FIFTH  MAHOMET THE PRINCESS  The Aga conducting the Princess a Guard enters with her an untwisted turban covering her face as a veil the Aga takes it off and then retires  MAHOMET  as the veil is taking off the Princess  This is a prize well worth a kingdom's contest  PRINCESS  Prince I thy justice claim The faith of Nations  Is by thy treacherous servants violated  A Truce protected them but they profan'd  Its sanctity and from an Altar tore me  Redress this wrong give me safe conduct back  MAHOMET  Princess I would forego my throne my life  Sooner than part with her whose charms would add  Splendour to Empire Paradise to earth  My faithful servants' zeal deserves my praise  I sent them for thee sent them for my Bride  PRINCESS  Thy Bride Alas thou know'st not Prince the wrong  I have sustain'd I'm torn from all my soul  Esteems from all my anguish'd heart holds dear  Torn from each social bliss from life from joy  From honour from the Husband of my love  Restore me then to all these sacred ties  By thy own Christian Mother  Mary the Daughter of George the Despot of Servia  I conjure thee  MAHOMET  No ties exist which can withstand my claims  What Husband Princess That mean slave Corvinus  Shall not exult in such a beauteous Wife  Radiant with youth and love's attractive grace  More fair than are the Daughters of our Paradise  Worthy to share in Mahomet's soft retirement  When war relaxes his stern brow and gives  An interval of peace to taste repose  Then will he joyful wear Agmunda's chains  And own no other Deity but Love  Oh to possess thy heart that when I come  From conquest thou may'st fly to meet me chide  My thirst for fame yet glory in my laurels  Then tell me how thou hadst thought lov'd dreamt of me  I hail thee charming Princess my Sultana  Sweet partner of my Imperial bed and throne  For by the Soul of my great Father Amurath  By this good Sword I swear  The following is the Oath of the Turkish Sultans "By the Immortal God by the four hundred Prophets by Mahomet by my Father's Soul by my own Children by the Sword wherewith I am girt I solemnly swear to perform what I have now promised" This Oath was sworn by Mahomet at the sacking of Constantinople three years before the Era of this Tragedy when he promised the soldiers that if they could take the City they should have the spoil of it for three days  ne'er to resign  During the greatest part of this speech the Princess seems absorbed in deep thought and solemn grief her eyes bent on the ground When Mahomet says "ne'er to resign" with a sudden burst of anguish and terrour as of one awaked in a fright she throws herself at the Sultan's feet  PRINCESS  End not thy oath I solemnly adjure thee  MAHOMET    offering to raise her she rises    'Tis sworn already I cannot resign thee  For by my Father's Soul the Oath was sworn  And 'tis so sacred did our Prophet live  Not he himself could with the Vow dispense  Thou shalt exult in Mahomet's ardent love  Thy every wish prevented thy whole life  One splendid feast of sumptuous delight  PRINCESS  Since the sole benefit I could accept  Thou dost refuse know in the whole wide range  Of all thy power thou hast nought left to give  Worthy Agmunda's thanks except a grave  MAHOMET  No beauteous Scorner no a tomb ill suits  Thy youth Whole ages of delight await us  Thou my Sultana I thy humble Slave  PRINCESS  I am the Wife of an illustrious Hero  My hand and heart are to Corvinus given  Respect the sacred tie of nuptial Faith  MAHOMET  Fate has dissolv'd it For you are my Slave  Taken in war When you refus'd my nuptials  The truce was void Fate has decreed you mine  PRINCESS  My Faith is pledg'd I never can be yours  Your prophet Sultan has forbidden marriage  With one who is a wifeRevere his law  MAHOMET  With a free woman marriage is forbidden  But my bond Slave  "Ye are also forbidden to take to wife free women who are married except those women whom your right hand shall possess as Slaves"  SALE's Translation of the KORAN p  although her Husband live  I by my Law may wed  PRINCESS  Or Slave or free  I am Corvinus' Wife Marriage with thee  E'en if I were thy Slave my Law would punish  MAHOMET  Renounce thy Christian Worshipown our Prophet  PRINCESS  Regarding Mahomet for a moment with haughtiness and contempt  Forsake my everlasting HopeFor what  The privilege to quit a noble Husband  Whom I adore for his unblemish'd honour  A gallant Youth who is his Country's bulwark  Forsake my GOD that I may wed a Tyrant  Whom my soul spurns at and my heart abhors  MAHOMET  What's thy resistance to a Monarch's power  Thy scorn may to resentment turn my love  Thou hast forgotten then that I am Mahomet  Whose frown annihilates the wretch it lights on  Whose least displeasure is such certain Death  The stoutest Warrior trembles to excite it  PRINCESS  With a swiftness as if some sudden illumination of thought at that instant struck her  I with unspeakable contempt behold it  Scoff at this dreaded tyrant who could send  Thousands of slaves beneath a lying embassy  To seize one Woman Heavens Art thou a Prince  Where is the honour that should grace thy rank  And give its brightest splendour to a throne  Thou base dishonourable treacherous coward  MAHOMET  Half drawing his sabre but sheathing it as he speaks  Audacious Fair that coward's power can crush thee  Make thy proud soul with fear shrink shuddering  And prostrate in the dust implore his mercy  PRINCESS  Derision and not fear thy taunts inspire  Dismay and terrour come they at thy beck  Behold a Woman braves a woman scorns thee  Her Soul superiour lords it o'er thy Spirit  Which aw'd and cow'ring droops before its greater  Thou Mahomet Thou appall'd shrink'st shudd'ring    Mahomet lays his hand on his sabre    Before a Christian foe before thy Captive  The Daughter of that sceptred Ancestry  The constant scourge of thy barbarian Race  Protected by thy fear defies thy sword  Disdains thy mercy she would shew thee none  The axe of Justice on thy neck should fall  And rid mankind of Thee their dire disgrace  Know trembling coward that I fear thee not  Thou dar'st not take my life    Mahomet in a rage draws his sabre having kept his hand upon it during the latter part of this speech advancing to strike the Princess she advances    MAHOMET    Turning away and dropping the point of his sabre leans upon it    I will not kill her    The instant that the Princess perceives that he will not kill her she retreats from him    PRINCESS  Tyrant art thou in abjectness so sunk  That thou hast not one generous vice Hast thou  No manly rage 'gainst an insulting enemy  Rouse thee to anger Prince Do not when scoff'd  And coward call'd forego a signal vengeance  Wreak thy revenge against an insolent foe  Who lives but to revile thee  MAHOMET  At thy call  I wake to rage resentment and revenge  Soon I'll repay thee this vindictive scorn  I see thy drift Agmunda Thou would'st die  And me the instrument of death would make  Thou bidd'st me vengeance takeand I will take it  Sheaths his sabre Terrour takes possession of the Princess's countenance for an instant  For thou shalt live I'll seize by force proud Woman  Those charms which vainly I have stoop'd to sue for  Mahomet advances to seize her she draws the Dagger from her bosom that Corvinus had given her as the pledge of his loyalty to her Brother Retreating as she speaks holding the Dagger fast clenched in her hand in readiness to strike it into her bosom Mahomet starts at seeing it and perceiving her intention to stab herself does not advance  PRINCESS  with a resolute solemn voice  This Dagger guards my Husband's honour Sultan  If thou approach I strike it to my heart  Death from dishonour saves me and from thee  Mahomet advances a step she extends her hand to strike he retires  Prince I dare pay that awful debt to Virtue  Which I to Nature owe And I will die  On the most slight suspicion of Dishonour  The moment that alarms my wakeful fears  Rememberis my last  MAHOMET  Striving to restrain his rage and disappointment  To save thy life  I promise that thy honour shall be safe  PRINCESS  Sultan I thank thee O relent and make  The life thou deign'st to save a blessing to me  Redeem thy honour and retrieve thy glory  Win by thy noble conduct my esteem  Yet yet be just permit me to depart  MAHOMET  with gloomy haughtiness  Unless thou wilt this hour consent to wed me  Thou art MY Slave no longer  PRINCESS  with joy and exultation  Unbounded gratitude  My heart repays thee noble generous Sultan  May joy like mine irradiate ev'ry gloom  That dark despair upon thy mind may cast  MAHOMET  fiercely  Forbear thy thanksFor since imprudent Princess  Thou dar'st disdain my love I here resign thee  Thou art my Slave no longerI bestow thee  Upon the vilest Tartar in my camp  The prince thou scorn'st makes thee a reptile's slave    The Princess raising her dagger      Mahomet hastily    Thy honour shall be safefifty brave Janizaries  Shall be thy guard to keep thee from all danger  In this thy bondage there is no dishonour  It is affliction only such affliction    Looking at her with the most taunting scorn    As CHRISTIAN Slaves must patient bear and live  PRINCESS    With extreme anguish looking up to Heaven    Thisis affliction's iron hand indeed  All gracious heaven for my one deep offence  Let this dire retribution make atonement  In mercy guard me from my own despair  And give me fortitude to meet my fate    Panting with terrour she supports herself by the drapery of the tent    MAHOMET  Art thou then obstinately bent to brave me    With entreaty mingled with admiration    Think of thy youth the graces of thy form  Thy ev'ry elegance thy winning charms  Have pity on thyself Doom not thy beauty  To a curs'd fate that chills my heart with horrour  Wilt thou not deign to deprecate thy doom  PRINCESS  If there be aught of human in thy heart  Say by what virtuous means I may awaken it  SCENE SIXTH  MAHOMET THE PRINCESS MUSTAPHA    Mustapha comes in sight on the same side on which the Princess stands but does not enter the tent    MAHOMET  Guards    They appear    To the inner tent conduct the Princess  Let none presume on pain of instant death  Her sacred person to approach uncall'd  To the Princess  This order may suffice to hush thy fears  Retire and let repose thy spirits calm  Have pity on thyself nor seal thy doom  PRINCESS    retiring to the inner tent    Sultan reflect nor force me to accept it    The Aga of the Guards opens the door of the inner tent on the righthand side the Guard  range themselves on the same side with the Sultan so that the Princess may enter the tent without passing near them When entered the door of the tent closes the Guards retire  SCENE SEVENTH  MAHOMET MUSTAPHA  MUSTAPHA  Sultan the Christian Dervis is thy prisoner  And waits without The Christians still maintain  The fight led by Corvinus  MAHOMET  Curse on his courage  Ten thousand sequins shall reward the man  Who kills Corvinus This proclaim Return  And here before the Princess say he's slain  Or true or false I have a rich revenge  But add such circumstance as may gain credence  To what thou say'st  Exit Mustapha  She must she shall be mine  What an exalted soul Agmunda owns  My spirit never was so mated yet  Envy and admiration both contend  And love and hate alternate swell my breast    To the Guards at the side scene    Conduct the Christian Dervis to our presence  He shall persuade the Princess  SCENE EIGHTH  MAHOMET CAMPESTRAN    in Chains    MAHOMET  Art thou Campestran  CAMPESTRAN  proudly  I am  MAHOMET  Better it would become thy Prophet's Minister  To preach of peace than clad in priestly vestments  The torch of Discord waving in thy hand  Thus to run madding wild from clime to clime  Leading enthusiasts to certain death  Battening our vultures with thy pious fools  Attend to heavenly cares leave arms and war  To Monarchs and to Heroes Priest I want  A peaceful service from thee reward awaits thee  If thou succeed  CAMPESTRAN  With Infidels I hold  No fellowship From me expect no service  MAHOMET  Thou art my Slave  CAMPESTRAN  The prisoner of thy arms  I know I am  MAHOMET  Thy life is in my hands  CAMPESTRAN  Take it a Christian warrior fears not death  Nor looks for noble treatment from base Mahomet  MAHOMET  And dost thou know me yet insult my power  CAMPESTRAN  Thy power thou lawless Ravager and Thee  My soul regards as Heaven's afflicting scourge  Gaunt famine pestilence and spotted plague  And curs'd imperial Plunderers like thyself  Are but its instruments of wrath to visit  Bad men's impiety Heaven's end obtain'd  Then are your waves of desolation stay'd  Ye shall not pass the bounds of its behests  Thy crimes accomplish'd yet thou shalt not triumph  The partner in thy ruffian treachery  Has paid the forfeit of His twofold guilt  Zilugo's sword has punish'd Cilley's treason  He dies first victim to the injur'd Princess  Restore her then and thus avert thy punishment  MAHOMET  Till thou canst rail the eagle to forsake  Her skybuilt aerie for the wren's humble nest  Thou dost but lose thy pains to lesson me  Say does thy Prophet's Law permit thee death  By thy own hands  CAMPESTRAN  No it forbids all murder  MAHOMET  Instruct thy Princess better in her duty  She dares uplift her hand against her life  Rail forth thy Law to her For if she die  By her own hand thou shalt expire in torments    Mahomet goes to the door of the inner Tent which is opened at his approach the Princess seen sitting on a sofa weeping    Princess thy warrior Dervis is my slave  Here I allow thee to hold converse with him    Campestran goes towards the inner Tent the Princess seeing him comes forward the dagger in her hand    SCENE NINTH  MAHOMET THE PRINCESS CAMPESTRAN  PRINCESS  O holy father much I grieve to see thee  Exhaustless is I fear my cup of woe  And thousands of the baleful draught drink with me  Say does my Hero live  CAMPESTRAN  Corvinus lives    The Princess looks up with thankfulness to Heaven    Long by his side I fought He still maintains  The fight with more than human strength His arm  The sword of Justice wields 'tis Heav'n's own sword  And he vicegerent of the wrath of Heaven  Exterminates from earth its scoffing foes  He will avenge the insult done to Thee  And to the Faith of Nations by thy capture  PRINCESS  Thou God of battles in a cause thus just  Raise thy strong arm and buckler on his side  Ye fainted Spirits of my royal Fathers  Implore the Throne of Mercy for this Hero  And save the guardian Genius of your Race  SCENE TENTH  MAHOMET THE PRINCESS CAMPESTRAN MUSTAPHA    Mustapha enters and lays the Sword and Casque of Corvinus at the feet of Mahomet  MUSTAPHA  Our Prophet fights the mighty Sultan's cause  MAHOMET  Whose Sword and Casque are these  MUSTAPHA  They are the spoils  Of fallen Corvinus whom Mesetes slew  PRINCESS  Oh  falls fainting into Campestran's arms  CAMPESTRAN  Supporting the Princess and raising his eyes t  Heaven  O send her strength proportion'd to her woes    The Princess recovering looks earnestly at the Sword and Casque and lifts the Dagger to kill herself Campestran stays her hand and continues  Rely on Heaven nor rashly shed thy blood  For life or death are not in mortals' choice  Bow down thy soul with patience to this grief  And as this separation wounds thy spirit  Let not thy rebel hand eternal make it  And lose the hope in realms of bliss to meet  The worthy object of thy love on earth  Resign this Dagger  PRINCESS  No as 'twas Honour's pledge  It shall be Honour's guardian  MAHOMET  Princess thy faith  According to thy Law is disengag'd  Consent that by thy Christian Rites Campestran  Shall now unite us  PRINCESS  Never will I consent  Never Corvinus to thy Tomb I'm wedded    To the Sultan    O let me see him that the sight may end me  Then give us the same grave And spare Belgrade  Her matrons virgins and her tender infants  And my last breath shall praise and bless thy mercy  MAHOMET  If thou wouldst have thy ardent prayers prevail  And save thy native City from my wrath  By all that's sacred to a Christian's soul  Thou first must swear not to attempt thy life  And in this very hour be my Sultana  Or else with fire and sword this night Belgrade  Receives my troops and sates my great revenge  Tomorrow thou shalt see thy City delug'd  With blood her Nobles in thy presence slain  Thou shalt behold my hated foe Corvinus  Piecemeal devour'd by our fierce ravening dogs  No other sepulchre will Mahomet grant him  CAMPESTRAN  This godlike youth shall he not find a grave  MAHOMET  Ask that obdurate Fair who gives remorseless  Her Husband's mangled corpse to vile dishonour  Her Country to the sword it is her will  Corvinus was my foe as such I treat him  Belgrade contains no friends who fight my cause  I plunge no sword into my Country's bosom  Nor sentence thousands to indulge my scorn  PRINCESS  Show Mercy Prince as thou wouldst wish to find it  Nor ask a price thou wouldst disdain to pay  Think on the chance of War and nobly use  The power which Heaven in vengeance to this Land  Ordains thy desolating sword to gain  Kneels  Think if some treacherous turn of human fate  Should thus bow down thy struggling mind to earth  Thus humbled thus abas'd in abject woe  If mercy thou wouldst hope O grant it now  By me the sorrowing People thus implore thee  Their anguish'd souls thus humbled to the dust  They deprecate thy rage and sue for mercy  MAHOMET  Did the whole Heavenly Hierarchy kneel  Unmov'd I'd act the purpose of my soul    Campestran raises and supports the Princess    But on the terms I proffer'd will I spare  Thou art the sovereign of thy Country's Fate  Live and be partner of my bed and throne  Else thy obdurate scorn shall wake more crimes  Than war's inventive cruelty yet knows  Pronounce the DoomIf mercy be thy will  Urge not my rugged soul by vain resistance  Lest thou shouldst rouse a storm beyond control  If thou wilt yield this moment is thy own  The next may be too late e'en for repentance  He walks away from the Princess    PRINCESS  Thy justice Heaven o'ertakes me for my perjury  For my transgression my brave Husband falls  Though great my fault yet dire beyond compare  On me thy overwhelming justice comes  Yet awful Power if sufferings can for crimes  Atone sure mine may hope to find remission  Let this dread expiation clear my guilt  Make me so pure that I may prove a victim  Acceptable to thee and save my country still  Mahomet approaches  O Mahomet I'll be ransom for this People  I swear till Heaven shall call my spirit hence  I will bear life nor free me from its load  Andif thou still insist to force my hand  I'll sacrifice myselfnayeven to Thee  But thou must swear to give my Country peace  On fair and honourable Princely Terms  Nor ask another Victim than myself  Must swear to grant my Husband's corpse a grave  And once again permit me to review  My native palace give me three sad days  To take a last farewell and see entomb'd  The Husband of my love  MAHOMET  I swear to grant  All thou hast ask'd but on this one condition  Instant be mine If thou attempt thy life  Thou doom'st Belgrade to an unheardof vengeance  Princess retire Thou Dervis with her go  And on thy life protect her from herself  Prepare thy nuptial rites I will but give  The orders which befit this change then come  And take my bride my fair my bright Sultana  The Princess supported by Campestran goes into the inner tent stopping at the Sword and Casque as she passes them  SCENE ELEVENTH  MAHOMET MUSTAPHA  MAHOMET  Vengeance and love ye both are in my power  MUSTAPHA  Corvinus though disarm'd was not o'ercome  Sav'd by his troops who gave their lives for his  Within our trenches they maintain their ground  Corvinus still is foremost in the fight  He will not yield nor can he now retreat  Dearly he sells his life and like Corvinus  MAHOMET  Come I will see him fall When dauntless heroes  Firm meet their fate they are more great than monarchs  Whom favouring fortune crowns with easy conquests  They are a sight for Gods to view and praise    Exeunt    End

ranged on the outside of the Tent Another discharge of cannon The door of the inner tent opens the Princess seen seated on a sofa fainting attendants supporting her  MAHOMET    Coming forward to the Attendants in the tent    SEE she attempts no deed of desperation    Door of the inner tent closes    Haste call Chusanes    To one of the Guards      To an Aga of the Guards    Aga sound my charge

Sultan's Knights and Sons  See KNOLLES p and Brief Discourse p and  form their ranks    The Aga goes out    Day dawns too slowly for my fierce impatience  Mustapha thou must guard my tent and watch  Over the life of this disdainful Princess  Maddening with grief and rage she when our cannon  Open'd their brazen throats feeling at once  Her Country's certain fate with all the energy  Of deep despair her bosom on the earth  Invok'd her God "By his dread Attribute  "Of fearful Justice to assert himself  "And curse me in the snare my falshood form'd"  Grief shakes her frame almost to dissolution    The Sultan's Charge sounded    Soon as returning life comes to her cheek  Be it thy care to impress her mind with hopes  Of winning mercy for her Country still  If she but live She must

Harrow his soul at once with all his crimes  Let every woe his savage heart inflicts  In all its bitterest agony recoil upon  His head till in despair he curse himself  In vain I'm sacrific'dthis tyrant's Wife  And not the saviour of my wretched Country  Has Hell a torment that can equal this  Had I but sav'd the People from destruction  Though plung'd in woe my fate would have been bliss  To

heard    O wretched Country O Friends Brother Husband  But I will join you    She again attempts to go Mustapha prevents her and signs to the Guards who advance stop the passage    Slave swift palsy blast  Thy ruffian arm unheardof plagues torment thee  Oh may'st thou share the maddening pangs I feel  And be so curs'd thou canst not even die    A Slave advances through the Guards and presents the Sultan's Ring to Mustapha who starts with horrour at the sight of it    MUSTAPHA    apart    Why came he not himself    He whispers to a Slave who retires then signs to the Guards who advance on both sides their hands on their sabres      Kneeling to the Princess    O peerless Woman  Hard is my fate to be again the messenger  Of woe to seal thy Doom The will of Heaven    The Slave appears with the

again  PRINCESS  Thou hast thyself to tread through Death's dark vale  Anticipate that hour when nature trembling  E'en though resign'd wants some sustaining friend  Then think how bitterly that hour would linger  To have about thy bed of death none other  Than objects of thy hate to see thee die  To view thy last sad pang and close thy eyes  Reflect on this and pity Me O lead me  Where in vile chains the good Campestran groans  Though deep my anguish and though fix'd my woes  His prayers will calm my soul and I shall die  Resign'd  MUSTAPHA  I grieve I cannot grant your wish  PRINCESS    with agitation    Such cruelty excites    Stops short repressing her anger      Recovering her solemn composure    But what have I  To do with human passions now The sorrows  Of my torn heart are just absolv'd My soul  Be firm the peaceful sleep of friendly death  Medicines thy load of woes Would I had where  To lay my weary head till that sleep comes    The Princess retires into the inner Tent      A discharge of Cannon a confused noise shrieks heard    SCENE FOURTH  MAHOMET CHUSANES ZOGANUS AGAS SPAHIES JANIZARIES MUSTAPHA c  Mahomet wounded and exhausted brought in by the Agas a turban bound round him The Agas support him as he recovers he struggles to shake them off they still hold him  CHUSANES  All Mustapha is lost Our Sultan wounded  As thou seest almost to death Flight alone  Can be our refuge in this wreck of fortune  Only the RearGuard is yet unassail'd  Let us with that retreat and save our Emperor  'Twill be a bloody and a desperate service  But better death than chains from Christian foes  MAHOMET    recovering    Ye curs'd rebellious Slaves give me a sabre  I'll not retreat before these scoffing Christians  Had I ten thousand lives I'd give them all  Rather than yield such triumph to my foes  Let me not live unless I live to glory    Struggling to get from them    Give me but armsI'll slay whole hecatombs  And if at last I fall a trophy leave  Such hosts of slain as shall record that Mahomet  With an unconquer'd spirit brav'd his fate  CHUSANES  Think of your wound  MAHOMET  Unhand me to revenge it  Begone ye recreant traitors Christian Slaves    He bursts from them    Nor hope to chain the whirlwind of my rage  I will have vengeance Dastards from the field  Ye forc'd your prince forc'd Mahomet to fly  Before a Christian Foe  CHUSANES  You were disarm'd  Wounded and fallen Our Prophet frowns upon us  And lets the Christians triumph  MAHOMET  Curse on his frowns  Mahomet repulsed at the siege of Scodra blasphemed in his choler and frantic rage most horribly against God most impiously saying  that it were enough for him to have care of Heavenly things and not to cross him in his worldly actions  KNOLLES p    Let him be satisfy'd to reign in Heaven  And leave this world to meWhy does he aid  These Christians Man alone could not achieve  Deeds like HuniadesThink of his feats  Since yester morn Though I destroy'd my Fleet  In hopes to stop his landing in the teeth  Of half my troops he lands swift mows his way  Athwart their serried ranks flies through Belgrade  Defeats my Army storms my Camp and turns  E'en my own Cannon 'gainst my flying Slaves  Though Amurath fled hence Gods must I fly  This was Mahomet's manner of expressing rage grief or disappointment And when under the influence of his rage he never thought of his own personal safety Once seeing his Admiral going to strike to a Genoese ship he spurred his horse so far into the sea that he narrowly escaped being drowned  After this siege of Belgrade no one dared to mention that city in his presence and he never mentioned it himself without expressions of grief    Strikes his forehead  CHUSANES  But yesterday his vaunted Son Corvinus  Whose fame transcends his own fled from your arms  MAHOMET  By Heaven that flight was great great as the triumph  Of curs'd Huniades Like a chaf'd Lion  Did he not rush from his insulted lair  Come forth with a few hundred men against  Embattled myriads Were not our slain  Double the number of his band With more  Than half his troops went he not back to tell  What he had dar'd Flight call you that from 'midst  An army such as mine 'Twas like a God  Lancing his terrours and then stepping back  To grasp more dreadful thunder 'gainst his foes  MUSTAPHA  The troops in yonder grove await your signal  Submit to fate retreat Allow your judgment  MAHOMET  Give me a sabre or I'll go unarm'd    He attempts to go crossing the stage to pass the Agas    MUSTAPHA    to the Agas    Friends beyond men be bold to save your Sultan    Whispers to Chusanes and the Aga next him the  whisper circulated round Chusanes Mustapha and the Agas range themselves to prevent Mahomet's passing  CHUSANES    raising his sabre    Yes gallant Mustapha  MUSTAPHA  Great Mahomet hear me  Let reason's voice now sway  MAHOMET    offering to go    I will not hear it  MUSTAPHA    Drawing his sabre and opposing his passage Chusanes and the Agas at the same time raise theirs and point them against Mahomet    Then this    lifting his sabre    must make it beam upon thy mind  Our Sabres reason with thy mad temerity  Sultan thou shalt not live to be a captive  No Christian shall exulting give thee chains  Thy faithful Slaves will end thee and then die  Mustapha's arm shall set the great example  Pierce thy brave heart then turn the reeking blade  Against his own    Trumpets sound an alarm the Turks face about surrounding their Sultan    Enter a Janizary  JANIZARY  Fly Fly Huniades has forc'd the Guard    A shout nearer and a discharge of cannon the Turks surround the Sultan    HUNIADES  spoken behind the scene  Rally the troops for Mahomet is here  Surround the tent This fiend shall not escape me  MUSTAPHA  Guards force the Sultan

themselves before the Sultan so as to face the Hungarians    SCENE FIFTH    A shout HUNIADES enters followed by VILACH and the Hungarians    HUNIADES  Tyrant thy fate Huniades is come    Mahomet bursts from the Janizaries Huniades and he aim at each other Mustapha catches upon his sabre the blow which Huniades strikes at Mahomet by which means his sabre is struck from his hand and the Hungarians make him prisoner The Janizaries rush before Mahomet those behind force him back Zoganus and Chusanes retreating oppose Huniades still keeping between him and the Sultan who is forced away    HUNIADES  Stay treacherous Infidel Barbarian fly not  MAHOMET    as he is forced away    Huniades Thy arm I still defy    Cannon and shouts    SCENE SIXTH  HUNIADES VILACH MUSTAPHA HUNGARIAN

Prudence indeed forbids us the pursuit    Another discharge of cannon    What right good service has their Ordnance done us  Mahomet may fall by his own dreadful enginery  Some Heavensent shot may execute that justice  Which Providence denies my trusty sword  VILACH    Seeing Huniades lean fainting upon the Officer next to him    General you droopYour wounds I fear are mortal  Alas if great Huniades survive not  Though the Turks quit the field they conquer Us  If you be lost our hearts will be subdued  Like dastards shall we fall and not like men    The Soldiers who fought against the Turks when Mahomet is forced away return with the royal Turkish standard    HUNIADES  looking at the standard  Belgrade is sav'd Grieve not for me my friend  I thought my death though certain not thus near  Think not of me the Princess claims your aid  Unless found here brave Friends pursue the foe  At any risk  MUSTAPHA  pointing to the inner tent  She is within that tent  HUNIADES    extremely

HUNIADES  Bathe not our laurels with your tears my Friends  Our Virgins Matrons Children Sires are sav'd  Rejoice Exult We fought we bled we conquer'd  The glorious work of Freedom is achiev'd  Yon field is won The struggle is no more  From Infidels our Country is redeem'd  Our infant King in safety wears his Crown    Sinks faint    VILACH  Must our bright Sun in his meridian blaze  Be veil'd in

 Exit guarded  Exeunt Hungarian Soldiers  SCENE EIGHTH  HUNIADES THE PRINCESS  HUNIADES  going towards the tent  Oh that my King had but Agmunda's virtues  Child as he is he then would grace a throne  And give transcendent hopes of future fame  Agmunda    Huniades opens the door of the inner tent the Princess discovered kneeling    PRINCESS  Starting and looking with astonishment at Huniades  Hah

but is unable    PRINCESS  Oh  HUNIADES  By fear bereav'd of sense she knows me not    Huniades throws away his helmet    Huniades thy friend thy Guardian saves thee  Thy Father's old greyheaded faithful Servant  PRINCESS  I know thee well thou art the guardian genius  Of this freed landHeaven's delegateHuniades  HUNIADES  Why Princess dost thou kneel For Heaven's sake rise    Raises her    PRINCESS  I swore an oath to Thee which Heaven attested  When thy persuasion arm'd against my peace  Fatally triumph'd o'er my ductile mind  I am forsworn For yestermorn my faith  Was at the Altar plighted to thy Son  I knelt for pardon for this breach of Oath  Which thou forgiving I then shall hope  Heaven will remit hereafter punishment  And its retributory justice end  When my vex'd spirit quits its mortal clay  HUNIADES  O Princess pardon me that I exacted  An Oath so fatal to thy peace State policy  Combin'd with honest zeal to fix the Crown  Safe on thy Brother's brow made me unjust  I curb'd the dearest wishes of my heart  Silenc'd ambition and parental love  To serve my Country and protect my King  May Heaven and you forgive the erring zeal  Which wrought the ill thy conscience thus deplores  But I must now rejoice and Heaven be witness  Pride of my soul admir'd belov'd Agmunda  How much I glory that thou art my Daughter  Exalted Princess may these faithful arms  PRINCESS

HUNIADES  Huniades is bless'd beyond his hopes  Not quiring Angels could impart more peace  Chaunting a Requiem to my parting soul  Than the dear comfort that thy pious hand  Most gracious Princess will perform a Child's  Last dutyclose my eyes  PRINCESS  That Heaven forbids  For by the Sultan's order I am poison'd  HUNIADES  Poison'd O my lov'd Princess O my child  My illstarr'd zeal expos'd

Exit Arnulph    PRINCESS  Oh send him not there is no aid for Me  The tyrant's ruffians know too well the trade  Of death to give a drug that has an antidote  I would not live What has the bride of Mahomet  To do with life    Huniades starts with surprise and horrour    HUNIADES  The Bride of Mahomet  The Sultan's Bride Didst thou not wed my Son  PRINCESS  Yes the last fatal day saw me his Bride  His Widowand the inhuman Sultan's Wife  When tidings came that thy brave Son was slain  In hopes to save the People from destruction  I gave my hand to this infernal spoiler  But first he kneeling swore to save Belgrade  And give my Country honourable peace  Betray'd forlorn of ev'ry hope bereft  Save to protect Belgrade from Fire and Sword  I gave myself a Victim for the Many  Sav'd at that price my gallant Husband's corpse  From those vile insults which the tyrant threaten'd  I gave my hand a ransom for his dust  Thus bought a Grave which fate had curs'd me so  I could not share for I was sworn to live  The miracle which Heaven has wrought to save us  By sending Thee whom I had mourn'd as dead  Was beyond thought Hope of deliv'rance perish'd  When dear Corvinus died  HUNIADES    Goes to the side scene and speaks to an Officer    Surround the Tent  Nor suffer any above the Rank of Soldier  To enter here  PRINCESS    Following Huniades and drawing him back    Stay with me till the strife  Is past Forsake me not in death's dread hour  My woes hang heavy on my parting soul  HUNIADES    with much emotion    They will embitter my last hours of life  PRINCESS  Her eyes fixed wildly upon Huniades taking his hand  Do not grieve thus see I am calm unmov'd  Patient amidst these horrours and sedate  HUNIADES    aside    Heavens madly calm and dreadfully sedate  PRINCESS  Alas this poison gives a cruel death  Fierce pangs and sad wild thoughts    Holding up her hands in a supplicating manner    Forsake me not    During this speech Huniades is much agitated The Princess hangs upon his arm he turns from her to hide his tears covering his face with his hand When she says with a voice of heartpiercing anguish  "forsake me not"  Huniades clasps her in his arms    HUNIADES  Forsake thee    Pauses from grief    Angel sufferernot for worlds  Were I a spirit beatify'd I'd pray  To quit the realms of bliss to be thy comforter  PRINCESS  Then thou wilt calm the terrours of this hour    With transient joy    My Country is redeem'd the People sav'd  And thou their Champion com'st to soothe my soul  Let the same earth entomb me with thy Son    With wild emotion    Thinkhow I love his dear his sacred dust  When at such hellish price I bought that dust  A GraveShall I not share itAm I poison'd  Death's icy hand arrests me that that consoles me  My troubled brain rolls like a sea of fire  My heart heaves cold damp sighs which freeze my lips    Strives to recollect    All is confusionstrange thoughts comethey're gone  Spare me a moment Heaven Avert these horrours  Divide us not in death    Clasping the hand of Huniades    Give us one Grave    With recollection and something of composure    Tell to the people how I strove to save them  Tell them to

just suffer'd  Death by Zilugo's sword  PRINCESS  Forgive him Heaven  This poison's terrible it warps my mind  Benumbs its firmness like a wither'd limb  Its active energy is lost and gone  I wish for death yet I feel terrour at it  I know not why horrour more fearful to me  Than midnight silence when cold breathless fear  Suspends the labouring soul in dread expectance  Of a fell murderer's stabthe bloody hand  Uplift to strike    She looks wildly as if she saw what she describes shrinking from it      Grasping Huniades' arm    Speak to me hold me    Lays her head on his shoulder    Hide

no one near the tentbut thou and I  PRINCESS  No I hope notThe vision comes to Me  Thou canst not see it    Corvinus approaches    Thou shalt have a Grave  Oh    She averts with her hand the approach of Corvinus who takes her outstretched hand she manifests by the horrour of her looks first turned to Huniades then on Corvinus that she knows how fatally she has been deceived by the account of his death and with a piercing groan dies  CORVINUS  Alas she faints  HUNIADES  My Son that groan was death  CORVINUS    Attempting to draw his sword Huniades prevents him    Detain me not Tell not the tale of horrour  That swells thy heartand let this give me peace    Again attempts to draw his sword Huniades prevents him    HUNIADES  Hope not for peace through unpermitted means  And dreadfor thy

CARLOS  Grandees of Castile  DON MANRIQUE  Count of Lara  DON LOPEZ  Count of Guzman  DON ALVAREZ  Count of Lunon  DON RAYMOND  Count of Moncade  DONNA ISABELLA  Queen of Castile  DONNA LEONORA  Queen Dowager of Arragon  DONNA ELVIRA  Princess of Arragon  BLANCHE  Grandees Officers of the Court Guards c  SCENEVALLADOLID  THE CONFLICT OR LOVE HONOUR AND PRIDE  Act First  SCENE FIRST The Antichamber to the Queen of Castile's PresenceChamber to which it opens by the Scene's dividing  DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA    Enter opposite sides    D LEONORA  HAIL to my darling Child This smiling morn  Rises auspicious to behold my joy  This is the birthday of thy regal power  And my child mounts this Day her Father's Throne  Revolted Arragon now courts thy sway  And with repentant heart wrenching thy sceptre  From Garcia's grasp repairs its long rebellion  The Deputies ere noon will here arrive  From exile to recall thee and restore  With signal honours thy long ravish'd Kingdom  To swear allegiance and to hail thee Queen  D ELVIRA  Oh may that Crown which Heaven this Day restores me  Add to my Mother's bliss as to her power  Though Queen I still her subject shall remain  Her prudent counsels and her wise resolves  Will sway and safely guide my youthful mind  This is indeed a Day of high import  Alike distinguish'd by eventful fate  To fix for Arragon and rich Castile  A future Monarch on their envy'd Thrones  This Day the beauteous Isabella names  The Husband of her choice and crowns him King  D LEONORA  O my Elvira wouldst thou fix thy choice  And now select a partner of thy Throne  From anxious care my mind would be reliev'd  Troubles from long misrule will rise in Arragon  And I am all thy counsel or defence  And can I on that Throne protect my Child  Which all her Father's valour fail'd to guard  A valiant Husband's arm would prop thy state  Disperse the mutinous and quell rebellion  Let prudence plead the cause of love Elvira  Reward the godlike passion of Alvarez  Who sought thy hand whilst hopeless of a Crown  Now emulate the worth thy soul esteems  And generous in thy turn be grateful too  Let thy first act as Queen be nobly just  Ascend thy Throne and name Alvarez King  D ELVIRA  Heaven well rewards his virtuous deeds to me  A Throne more splendid far than mine now courts him  With Isabella in Castile to reign  The brave Castilians name him of the  Three  From whom they wish their Queen to chuse a Consort  First my dear Mother let me mount my throne  Before I fix with whom that Throne to share  D LEONORA  Ah my foreboding fears Your choice is made  Reflect my Child whilst yet the power remains  What grief what dangers may await your love  Resist this fatal impulse of your heart  Which will embitter all your future life  Could my maternal bosom yield consent  Yet would the Nobles of your Realm submit  To bow the knee to one plebeian born  Too much alas the valiant Carlos charms you  But what avails his matchless worth His blood  Springs from some base contaminated source  Which he through pride with conscious shame conceals  D ELVIRA  Yet though conceal'd its source may be most pure  For have not princes men of high renown  Disguis'd themselves their names and birth deny'd  Whose swords alone have signaliz'd their fame  Subduing kingdoms and bestowing crowns  Singly the fate of empires and of kings  D LEONORA  Is this the flattering hope your heart has cherish'd  And the distinction which you pay to Carlos  Is it then love grafted on hope fallacious  Ah my dear Child give not such room for censure  Nor cherish sentiments you must subdue  Avoid the converse which destroys your peace  And lends the venom'd tongue of slander speech  D ELVIRA  Such rare endowments and such gallant worth  As Carlos owns in noble minds excite  Esteem complacent friendship and urbanity  I but that tribute of regard bestow  Which his transcendent virtues justly claim  Chaste as a sister's innocent affection  Can this reflect upon my virgin fame  Or draw the breath of calumny against me  D LEONORA  Beauty and youth with princely rank combin'd  Winning admirers draw observers too  The storm unheeded deluges the weed  Whilst on the garden's pride the peerless lily  And the sweet opening rose not unobserv'd  Hang e'en the freshning dewdrops of the morn  Carlos commands respect from ev'ry heart  And did his merits less conspicuous shine  Your gentle soul uncensur'd might esteem him  But to each virtue that adorns the man  A warrior's valour and a hero's fame  He adds each striking each attractive grace  Commanding awful yet inspiring love  In port a monarch and in mind a god  When he appears each eye with pride surveys him  All seem to take a fashion from his mien  And with complacent hope admire their model  Though ev'ry lady courts him by her smiles  Whom has he yet distinguish'd but yourself  Save when he pays his duty to his Queen  In his attention you such pleasure take  That you betraymore than esteem for Carlos  D ELVIRA  That homage which queens claims does Carlos offer  He pays his court like others who approach me  Worth such as his knows no temerity  D LEONORA  With you to Arragon does Carlos go  Only to pay his court as here he pays it  The worth he owns may make his thoughts aspire  And he who guards your Throne may hope your love  D ELVIRA  War is the element of souls like his  From victory to victory they fly  Glory their idol and their wish distinction  Seville dismantled and the Moors defeated  Castile triumphant wants his arm no more  His great ambition thus without an object  Offers his sword against our Rebel Garcia  His valour will achieve what with success  Our subjects have begun chase this Usurper  And bid fair peace and safety grace my Throne  D LEONORA  But when his conqu'ring sword has fix'd your reign  Your subjugated Vassals at your feet  Will Carlos quit your Realm to seek fresh toils  Nor hope that Crown his valour may have sav'd  D ELVIRA  Madam the Queen approaches to give audience  SCENE SECOND  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE  D LEONORA  This Day then Madam this distinguish'd Day  You will reward some happy lover's flame  D ISABELLA  I at my People's prayer proclaim a King  A Husband chuse a partner of my Throne  D ELVIRA  Alas methinks my royal friend appears  With more than usual sadness in her eye  Long has her heart conceal'd a load of grief  Refus'd to make me partner of the cause  And shunn'd my converse save in hours of state  My joy on this eventful Day believe me  Will want its charms if Isabella mourn  With such delight she hail'd my change of fortune  I thought last night that all her griefs were fled  D ISABELLA  Still my Elvira does my heart rejoice  In thy recover'd Crown e'en whilst I sigh  To lose the friend I from my cradle lov'd  Thy joy alone can gladden my sad soul  Oppress'd and harrass'd by corroding care  I sacrifice my peace this fatal Day  But to the State's repose I yield my own  All the Grandees ambitious of the Crown  Embroil by their intrigues the public peace  To terminate their feuds I name a King  Castile through all her States conjures me to it  And by my order three Grandees elects  To  one  of whom I this  hour  give my Throne  D LEONORA  Three most renowned Heroes they elect  Don Manrique Lopez and the brave Alvarez  Though not of royal blood are worthy thrones  D ISABELLA  Ah what to me avail the shouts of fame  Which hail them idols of the public choice  If of my heart the gallant Don Alvarez  Lopez nor Manrique be the chosen lord  D LEONORA  Though nam'd to them your choice is not confin'd  Speak your heart's wish your Vassals will obey  D ISABELLA  Though born my Subjects yet I am their Slave  And bound by laws Kings tremble to infringe  A royal rank imposes stern restraints  The hearts of Kings must neither love nor hate  I am less free than e'en my meanest subject  Chain'd by fastidious glory to her car  Which nice imperious jealous honour guides  My heart must feel for others not myself  Each wish ungratify'd each grief disdain'd  Stops short      To Blanche who speaks to an Attendant    Are the States met    Aside    Oh could this fatal Choice  Be still delay'd or never never made  Calm gracious Heaven this conflict of my soul  Direct my actions and inspire my thoughts    The scene dividing gives entrance into a magnificent PresenceChamber A royal throne under a canopy Two chairs of state in a line with the throne At the righthand of the throne a small ornamented stand higher than a table upon which the Sceptre and Regalia are placed Seats ranged on each side of the throne to the front of the stage the Grandees Officers of the Spanish Court standing before them The Royal Guards standing behind the seats The Grandees take off their hats and remain uncovered till the Queen  has walked to the platform of the throne and when she turns round and speaks they put them on Carlos only remains uncovered    SCENE THIRD  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE DON MANRIQUE DON ALVAREZ DON LOPEZ CARLOS  Grandees Officers of the Court Guards c c    The Queens go towards the throne the Queen of Castile in the middle At the foot of the platform the Queen of Castile turns addresses the Court    D ISABELLA  Lopez Alvarez Manrique whom my States  Have nam'd as worthy to ascend my Throne  Before I grant their prayer and name a Sovereign  Brave Counts a solemn Oath I ask from each  Swear uncontested to accept my choice  That the rejected  Two  nay all the  Three    If 'tis my pleasure to reject them  all  Will  whom  I name for King own as his Master  My Right to chuse my Lords you must now recognise  And swear to guard that Right inviolate  When I shall name my Husband and your King  Both of my Crown and Self I may dispose  I hold my State's Election as no law  Nor shall it subjugate my royal Will  Well pleas'd I view their justice to your worth  Showing their high esteem of your exploits  Which though it shall not rule may guide my choice  May Heaven's Omniscient Will illume my mind  Make me the agent of its high behests  That my now choice the worthiest may reward    To the Grandees    Ye Nobles of Castile my People's Delegates  I grant their prayer Own ye my royal Rights  That in myself alone resides the Power  To chuse my Husband and divide my Rule    The whole Court each having his right hand on his heart how assenting      To the Counts    These Rights thus recognis'd swear Counts to guard  D LOPEZ  Unquestion'd unoppos'd I swear to guard them  Your States but supplicate nor mean restraint  And in obedience solely to your Will  Have they made known their sentiments of us  Not from their favour but your own free choice  Do I presuming think to gain your hand  An honour which I scarcely dare to hope  But as a bliss unmerited is hop'd for  I own your Power to give without control  That hand which monarchs proudly might dispute  E'en to the meanest subject in Castile  Yet this unprecedented grace I trust  Will on the least unworthy be conferr'd  Justice and prudence must inform your judgment  That to use all your power may not behove you  Such Madam are my thoughts  D ISABELLA  Speak yours Don Manrique  D MANRIQUE  Though madam your discourse schools us to fear  And inly breeds suspicion in our minds  Yet I attest your Right and own your Power  To chuse a Husband and to bid him reign  Long ere you grac'd a Throne my soul ador'd you  The King your Brother my lamented Master  Deign'd on my love to smile and bade me hope  Fondly my heart the flattering thought has cherish'd  That four whole years of anxious constant love  At last may win your pity and regard  Yet if in this sweet hope my mind deceive me  I  swear  since you demand this test of fealty  Though to despair you doom my faithful heart  That  He  whom your free choice pronounces bless'd  I as my King and Master will obey  Protect his person and support his power  With warmest zeal and constant firm allegiance  D ISABELLA  Brave Don Alvarez what is your resolve▪  D ALVAREZ  I will not be importunate in speech  Chuse of  us Three  or make another choice  I swear implicitly t'obey your will  D ISABELLA  smiling  Beneath this deference this profound respect  We spy the leaven of conceal'd indifference  And as your heart sighs for another's charms  'Tis thus on both sides that you homage pay  D ALVAREZ  Madam  D ISABELLA  A truce my Lord    Donna Isabella mounts the step of the platform and seats herself upon the throne The Queens of Arragon mount the platform and seat themselves The Dowager Queen Leonora on the righthand side of the throne and Elvira on the left  D ISABELLA  Let each take place    The Three Counts and the Grandees who form the Court seat themselves on the seats prepared for them Don Lopez on the righthand side of the throne Don Alvarez and Don Manrique on the left Carlos who stands on the righthand side of the throne in a line with the Grandees but below them nearest the audience seeing a place unoccupied next to Don Lopez near to whom he stands seats himself Don Manrique rising steps from his rank and speaking Carlos rises Don Lopez rises the instant Carlos attempts to seat himself  D MANRIQUE  Rise Carlos rise Whence such audacity  D LOPEZ  What title have you to assume this rank  And seat yourself with the Grandees of Spain  CARLOS  Vacant the place my Lords and as in camps  So oft in council with my King I sat  I thought in courts to fill a place as well  D MANRIQUE  A Soldier to usurp the rank of Count  The favours of your Prince make you forgetful  CARLOS  Think me not Count asham'd of  what I am  Nor yet forgetful of  what first  you knew me  Soldier's a title for a Prince to boast  Carlos though now he holds a General's truncheon  Remembers that five years are not elaps'd  Since as a  Soldier  in the common ranks  He fought unnotic'd and without distinction  One of that  mass  whose valour gains the war  Whilst he who leads claims all the wreath of fame  The late good King your royal Master Lords  Who knew my deeds from rank to rank promoted me  He thought that I had earn'd my General's staff  If otherwise  you  judge the time is come  When Sovereign Power may give you to reclaim it  D MANRIQUE  Presumptuous Carlos how dares your arrogance  A second time offend Was't not enough  To rank yourself with our Nobility  That when rebuk'd you dare our justice question  Had I or brave Don Lopez now the power  We should disdain to take your honours from you  Deeds which will grace our history's future page  Deeds but acknowledg'd not rewarded yet  Your godlike arm invincible has done  The Royal Standard of Castile was taken  In the King's sight your youthful arm redeem'd it  This perilous action turn'd the tide of battle  Inspir'd our troops with courage to drive back  The conqu'ring Moors e'en to their rocky fastness  Till from the vanquish'd we became the vanquishers  CARLOS  My Lord I ask you not to word my deeds  A  Soldier  glories more to act than vaunt them  D MANRIQUE  Unask'd I speak them to convince your pride  I bear no envy to the worth I value  From chains you sav'd the King in Andalusia  When pierc'd with wounds upon a heap of dead  Your body was so long his shield his troops  Gain'd time to rally those foes who hemm'd him in  Were sacrific'd and the same squadron which went  To rescue him a victor brought  him  back  And  you  almost expiring You mounted first  Upon the walls of Seville slew Roderigo  And maintain'd the breach whilst the Castilians enter'd  Then at their head storm'd the strong citadel  And forc'd its gates Of many great exploits  These are but some Don Lopez and myself  To you indebted stand for life and liberty  For when surrounded by triumphant Moors  Then when we trembled prisoners to their arms  By you our Guardian Genius bade them fall  Fate to our foes and providence to us  You conquer'd numbers to redeem  us  bled  CARLOS  My soul rejoic'd to aid the valiant's cause  'T was but a Soldier's part I did brave Count  And had your fate been mine yourself or Lopez  Would have done more to guard my life or liberty  D MANRIQUE  To speak your worth is due to my own honour  Lest I be thought invidious of your glory  Your rank and not your courage I dispute  I think your valour has not had its meed  The late King promis'd to reward it further  But death surpriz'd him just as he resolv'd it  D ISABELLA  I Carlos who his crown inherit take  His debt on me and amply will repay you  My Brother held you high in his esteem  He thought few equal in his court to Carlos  For valour in the field or in the council  For wisdom prudence and distinguish'd vigour  Counts let this difference end Be seated Carlos  D LOPEZ  Ere he takes Rank with the Grandees of Spain  First Madam order him to name his Family  We in no wise contest his bravery  Supernal power hath nerv'd his youthful arm  To achieve such deeds as would become a god  Let him declare his race and genealogy  His lineage state for valour without birth  Had never right to occupy such place  CARLOS  Let him who wills boast honours others earn'd  I will owe nought to those who gave me life  I'd rather equal Caesar in the field  Than trace my lineage to the Julian Race  What do we know of Macedonia's Kings  Worthy record till Philip rose in arms  And Alexander triumph'd o'er the world  Hereditary honours I disdain  And know proud Counts I would not give the name  My sword has earn'd to be Medina's Duke  E'en though Don Manrique's blood enrich'd his veins  I claim no parents but my past exploits  My valour be my Race My arm my Lineage  D LOPEZ  The proof is clear that Carlos is not Noble  D ISABELLA  Then I whose Son soe'er he be or what  His Race  ennoble  him Contest no more  D MANRIQUE  Permit me yet one word  D ISABELLA  Not one Don Manrique  For this audacity assumes too much  Must I have leave from you to ennoble Carlos  D MANRIQUE  Nobut that place is due to highest dignities  And though ennobled Carlos cannot take it  'T is sacred to the High Grandees of Spain  One less than Count or Marquis would profane it  D ISABELLA  Henceforth then Carlos Marquis of Santillane  Count of Pennafiel and Governor of Burgos  Your titles claim Don Carlos I create thee  One of the High Grandees Assert your Privilege    He puts on his hat    And take your Rank    He seats himself    Is this enough Don Manrique  To give him privilege to take that place  Does there remain  one  scruple in your mind  D MANRIQUE  Madam complete your work and make him King  To grace him by such dignities is less  To equal him to us than to exalt Carlos  To your own Rank Your skilful prelude Princess  And those exacted Oaths we have just sworn  Show that your heart has made its choice of Carlos  We bound by vows must ratify that choice  I shall obey nor aught attempt against it  To him I here resign You and your Kingdom  I quit your presence ere you make him King  Not as one jealous at it but through fear  Lest for You Queen I blush when you shall name him    Going      The Queen rises precipitately from her throne and descends from the platform the whole Court rises The Queens of Arragon remain standing upon the platform Donna Elvira is much agitated during the last speech when risen she leans for support upon her chair her Mother observes her very attentively    D ISABELLA    with anger    Stay Insolent    D Manrique returns      Recovering her temper    Your Queen forgives you Manrique  What an unworthy fear imprudently suspects  To silence which I condescend so far  As to declare that in my States' just choice  I acquiesce that you still hold the rank  You held in my esteem and I attribute  This fiery transport to excess of love  Injurious as it is I pardon it  Ere your reflection pleads for love's offence  D MANRIQUE  Your conduct Queen gave rise to my offence  Honours so lavish'd warranted suspicion  Excuse too Madam some antipathy  D ISABELLA  Forbear to justify your insolent pride  Though pardon'd Manrique it shall learn humility  My sacred Rights as woman and as Queen  You have profan'd with impious disrespect  Slander'd my conduct and my power insulted  Grant that I Carlos love or that I solely  Through pure esteem pay tribute to his worth  Raising his Rank above your lordly scorn  Whate'er be my design you should respect  Either the choice my heart has made or what  My power creates and will support proud Vassal  To curb your scorn still higher will I raise him  Grant him prerogative beyond my own  Myself and Crown I to his power intrust  I made Him Marquis He shall name a King  You own his merit he shall judge of yours    To Don Carlos    Twice has your arm redeem'd my throne and kingdom  Now let your wisdom like your valour shine  And worthily bestow the Crown you sav'd    Advancing a step or two towards Don Carlos and presenting her ring to him    Lord Marquis take my Ring And as your testimony  On the most worthy of these  Three  bestow it  And hail him KingWhat of this Day remains  Is yours to weigh their merits and reward them  Ambitious Rivals pay your court to him  He who presents me with my Ring from Carlos  Shall instantly receive my hand and Crown  Queens let us go and leave them to determine  To whom in preference I would give my Kingdom    The Queens retire the scene closes upon the Court leaving the three Counts and Carlos at the fro  t of the stage    SCENE FOURTH  DON MANRIQUE DON ALVAREZ DON LOPEZ DON CARLOS  D LOPEZ    ironically    Will my Lord Marquis deign to inform his suppliants  What may be requisite to win his favour  He is our judge he therefore must be soften'd  D CARLOS  This illplac'd raillery is most unseemly  D MANRIQUE  To supplicate You Carlos is unseemly  D CARLOS  A truce with raillery or supplication Lords  Let us continue friends Well will I use  The trust the Queen has in my hands repos'd  Nor shall you Counts complain of my decision  For I refuse to be the Judge myself  I give you one that it will be dishonour  But to suspect The impartial  Sword  brave Lords  A Queen and Kingdom on this Ring depend  Both are well worth the contest you have courage  I guard this Ring    Carlos puts it upon his finger    D LOPEZ  And for whom guard it Carlos  D CARLOS  My vanquisherHe who can take it from me  Pledge of his worth shall to the Queen present it  The order time and place amongst yourselves  Agree I will await your summons and obey it  SCENE FIFTH  DON MANRIQUE DON ALVAREZ DON LOPEZ  D MANRIQUE  Think of his arrogance  D ALVAREZ  'T is thus a soul  By valour nobly form'd repels an outrage  D MANRIQUE  If he expect to measure Swords with  us    His pride has most egregiously deceiv'd him  D ALVAREZ  Refuse a challenge  D MANRIQUE  Yes beneath our rank  Grandees of Spain all jealous of their honour  Do not expose their lives to bold adventurers  D ALVAREZ  How can you thus degrade a valiant warrior  Nay were he what your hatred has presum'd  We ought to treat him as the Queen has rank'd him  D LOPEZ  When the Queen braves us nor regards our blood  But dares the lustre of our Rank to tarnish  Raising this Minion to an equal rank  D ALVAREZ  Are Kings accountable for whom they title  Our equals flourish or neglected fade  Just as their pleasure wills  D MANRIQUE  My Lord you're politic  In the respect you pay to majesty  But own your thoughts do you not judge she loves him  That had she dar'd she would have nam'd him King  Were not her speeches artful and mysterious  D ALVAREZ  You show'd such high disdain of valiant Carlos  And with such contumacy brav'd the Queen  Arraign'd her conduct and her power disputed  She was constrain'd to go the lengths she did  Or yield her dignity forego her power  Desert the brave and side with his high scorners  You piqued her pride her sex's niceness wounded  Your speech indelicate and haughty carriage  Were more than Queen or Woman ought to bear  Would you my Lord be by your vassal brav'd  Having the power to humble him to earth  Would you not use that power till his pride yielded  Subordinate to reason and respect  D MANRIQUE  My Lord you are a warm apologist  But are you friend or lover in this cause  Do you indeed pretend to Isabella  'T is said that Arragon's fair Queen has charms  D ALVAREZ  Her charms are not the subject of discussion  My Country honours  me  with that esteem  To think me worthy to become its King  Grateful for this and my own fame respecting  I will not Counts refuse the grace it shews me  I therefore with the Marquis brave Don Carlos  Will measure swords nor think my Rank dishonour'd  If from his valour I can win the Ring  Then Lords with you I will contest the Crown  D LOPEZ  Gladly with you we shall dispute this prize  You are a rival worthy of our swords  But for this Marquis he must seek his equals    Exeunt severally Don Alvarez the same way that Don Carlos went Don Manrique and Don Lopez at the opposite side    End of the First Act  Act Second  SCENE FIRSTA ROOM OF STATE  DONNA ISABELLA BLANCHE  D ISABELLA  seated on a sofa    I Pray thee Blanche retire  BLANCHE  Insist not Madam  I cannot leave you thus  D ISABELLA  Why wilt thou stay  I blush that mortal should behold my tears  Or view the pangs that rend my anguish'd heart  Thy feeble pity cannot change my fate  Nor thy calm reason argue me to peace    Rising    For I am doom'd to feed a hopeless flame  Is this to be a Queen Ah dearbought greatness  A Queen A wretch in state chain'd down by prejudice  A pageant slave a vassal to a throne  Great but for others powerless for myself  BLANCHE  Madam control this grief think of your Rank  D ISABELLA  Rank can it root out passion from my soul  And change my mould of mind annihilate  The softness from my heart the cherish'd thoughts  The oftrecurring hopes of fabled bliss  I have so fondly form'd but must not share  Pride guard my mind and apathy my heart  And let my feelings with my fate agree  BLANCHE  O Madam how I trembled for your glory  For from the Oath you made your lovers swear  I thought you fix'd to give your Crown to Carlos  But you have nobly conquer'd your own heart  Whilst you sustain'd your regal dignity  D ISABELLA  Say rather Blanche that Love usurp'd my throne  And with a monarch's wrath aveng'd my lover  I thought that I was master o'er my heart  I had not plann'd to act as thou hast seen me  Although I mean'd to honour Carlos highly  I only will'd to try the Counts' respect  And to secure my power and royal Rights  For as alas this choice was dreaded by me  It seem'd like a relief a sort of pleasure  To lose a little time to loiter lingering  Thus to retard my doom and put off fate  Yet I was going to nameI had no choice  And could Don Manrique have restrain'd his pride  Castile perhaps ere this had hail'd him King  He urg'd my temper to its utmost bearing  And scarcely I refrain'd from naming Carlos  To gall his pride for daring to insult me  BLANCHE  I marvel not that you chastise his insolence  Which on you cast such shame and rude reproach  D ISABELLA  Under the specious plea to avenge my power  Love found a fair pretence to scatter favours  I have made Carlos Marquis Count and Governor  Oh with what joy could I have hail'd him King  How my heart pleaded Yet by these profusions  I thought to satisfy and silence it  For to pronounce against him much distress'd me  And when I bade him give away my Crown  'Twas only that he might himself exclude  I parley'd with my power to soothe my heart  And did an outrage where I seem'd to honour  BLANCHE  Fearing to make him King you make him more  D ISABELLA  My heart indifferent to all the Three  Thought that it best could like whom Carlos chose  This sudden fancy sway'd my conduct Blanche  But now I wish I had repress'd the thought  And humbled Manrique by some other means  For I have err'd in making Carlos Judge  He bids the sword decide Ah does he hope  To gain me thus himself Does he then love me  I dare not trust my thoughts that dangerous length  I must prevent the sword from being drawn  And by my choice stifle these dreaded feuds  BLANCHE  'Twill be an arduous task to wrench the sword  From valour's hand when custom bids it grasp it  He who retracts is ignominious held  And honour to great souls is more than life  D ISABELLA  I would not so disgrace my power to affront  That valour I admire For when obedience  Is by dishonour stain'd kings go too far  And undermine their own omnipotence  Feigning to grant I will prevent this combat  If they remit it then I hold it broken  See Carlos to obey my order comes    Exit Blanche    SCENE SECOND  DONNA ISABELLA DON CARLOS  D ISABELLA  Marquis Castile has by your arm been sav'd  Its gratitude I till this Day reserv'd  To make its favours more conspicuous shine  Granted in full assembly of my States  Much has it griev'd me when I mean'd reward  But to stand forth the champion of your worth  And ere my purpose to yourself was known  To have those honours to your merit due  Extorted as an act of justice from me  As if I wanted soul in virtue's cause  Freely to pay where I indebted stood  For services almost beyond reward  Yet whilst I own no recompense can reach them  I trust that I have shown I prize your virtues  Spite of that envy which pursues your merit  I unsolicited have rais'd your fortune  Yet if not equal to your just ambition  If other recompense you hop'd or wish for  Speak to your own content I will oblige you  D CARLOS  My Queen's exalted spirit has bestow'd  Such high such fullblown honours as my soul  Dar'd not in thought conceive far less expect  Troubled amaz'd confus'd o'erwhelm'd with bounty  Let her not think I have one wish ungratify'd  D ISABELLA  Yet when above your hopes I raise your fortune  Grace and distinguish you with all my favour  Lean on your judgment with a sister's confidence  You give me Marquis reason for complaint  D CARLOS  How Madam have I sinn'd  D ISABELLA  Your sword is rais'd  Against the State's repose and against mine  The strongest pillars of the State are Manrique  Lopez and Alvarez in them you undermine it  In them you seek to shed its purest blood  Think to what height my people prize these Counts  Since worthy each is deem'd to share my Throne  D CARLOS  Madamthis blame  D ISABELLA  My Lord when thus I censure you  And to yourself whate'er complaint I make  Such frankness tells in what esteem I hold you  I would prevent you from incurring blame  Guarding your honour thus I mean you favour  Your pride against the Counts has arm'd your vengeance  There was no need my Lord to draw your sword  I had aveng'd the insult you sustain'd  Nor did I leave your triumph incomplete  When I deputed you to give my diadem  I made you the Counts' Judge but not their foe  Bidding the sword decide you much mistake me  D CARLOS  Then has my judgment not my duty err'd  Only my courage do the Counts allow me  Therefore in that I humbly put my trust  To prove who worthiest  D ISABELLA    interrupting him    Did you then hope  If o'er all Three your prowess gave you 'vantage  It would be said chusing Castile a King  The State could find none to compare with you  If thus presumptuous and thus vain I thought you    Stops short    D CARLOS    kneeling after a moment's pause    Oh spare the injurious accusation Madam  If you repent your favours Gracious Queen  My ruin is no difficult achievement  Yet do not charge me with unthoughtof crimes  Nor arm your anger with unjust suspicions    The Queen signs to him to rise    I love you Queen but with a flame as pure  As from the hallow'd sacrifice ascends  As we love honour virtue Heaven itself  And if the matchless lustre of my Sovereign  Dazzles a moment my enchanted soul  Sudden it back returns and downcast shrinks  Into itself Ambitious sighs vain hopes  And criminal desires I never breath'd  D ISABELLA  'Tis wellI find myself mistaking Carlos  D CARLOS  I Madam only as a Queen can love you  For should unhallow'd passion rise within  My guilty breast should you O pardon Princess  The impious thought should you so far forget  Your sacred self and what you owe your rank  As to partake the passion you inspir'd  And suffer me to breathe my vows before you  If by some fatal fascination curs'd  Your sensibility should so degrade you  As to descend e'en from your Throne to me  Know my esteem would instantly decrease  And my love rais'd on that would soon expire  D ISABELLA  Marquis your thoughts are worthy a great soul  D CARLOS  Your glory Madam is my heart's first object  In combating the Counts I have no wish  But to make known him who deserves you most  Ill should I answer your high confidence  If only on my judgment I depended  To chuse your Spouse and partner of your Throne  Allseeing power direct the sword of him  Who best deserves her through my ready heart  D ISABELLA  Carlos forbear nor interest Heaven itself  Against my peaceWhy must the Sword decide  Blushing with shame at weakness unsubdu'd  I own I love one of the purpos'd combatants  Yet should I not have nam'd whom I prefer  For though I love my Country's good outweighs  My tenderest thoughts my heart foregoes its choice  And seeks the Hero who deserves to reign  And by my subjects' will be most approv'd  After Don Manrique's most opprobrious insolence  Fearing my partial heart might sway my judgment  To yours I trusted and consign'd my Crown  Not thinking you would bid the sword decide  And harrass with new woes my wounded peace  Carlos respect his life whom I esteem  Reflect how hard his fate to lose a Throne  Respect the sufferings of my sorrowing soul  Torn for my People's good from him I love  Let me not have to mourn his hapless death  With poignant anguish neverending tears  D CARLOS  O Queen I would not dare to wrest your confidence  Guessing the secret which your scruples veil  Nor solve the mystery hidden beneath your words  Yet hear your faithful Servant gracious Princess  Trust me such equal heroes are these Counts  On your heart's choice you safely may rely  Why then reject with cruel heroism  The good which Heaven has plac'd within your reach  Let not the thirst of glory now deceive you  It soon will pall and to vacuity  Will leave your heart or else a prey to grief  Did virtue claim the purpos'd sacrifice  That motive in full force would constant last  And lenient sooth at once and heal your mind  O dread the agony of hopeless passion  It steeps the warrior's manly cheek in tears  And makes him joyless though with laurels grac'd  Brave not this ceaseless torment of the soul  It is the baleful poison of sweet peace  No balm can medicate no time assuage  To which night brings no sleep nor dayspring joy  O Heaven instruct me in which happy lover  I may revere my gracious royal Mistress  That by an easy and a sudden victory  D ISABELLA  It must not beIf through respect for me  One of the Three you spare you give the prize  You make me JudgeI dare not must not chuse  You urge me Carlos to the brink of fate  You add fresh conflicts to an o'ercharg'd heart  Your eager valour hazards all my peace  Heedless you pierce my heart with wounds immedicable    Turns from D Carlos to hide her emotion    I would avoid discussion on this subject  Though as a Queen I might forbid these combats  I will not wound your honour nor the Counts  The Lists shall be prepar'd the challenge held  Who of the Three is first to try his fortune  D CARLOS    observing the Queen    Alvarez Madam  D ISABELLA  He for another sighs  D CARLOS  Yet He alone the glorious prize contests  D ISABELLA  Gallant Alvarez first though thou lov'st me not  Tomorrow shall his courage be display'd  D CARLOS  This day the challenge of Alvarez names  D ISABELLA  If I consent not what avails his challenge  On your allegiance be it then deferr'd  Carlos adieuRespect my prohibition  SCENE THIRD  D CARLOS    alone    Defer the fight Is not my valour stain'd  By this command And will not honour blush  Has the Queen right to give me law Am I  Her Subject No I was born in Arragon  Heavens I remember that and dare stand here  CountMarquisGovernor of Burgos too  Yet know myself born of the meanest race  Only the Son of a poor peasant Shepherd  Taught by a pious Priest through charity  Till learning made me wild with mad ambition  To act the heroic deeds I joy'd to read  Oh should these Lords discover my mean birth  With what insatiate scorn would they exult  How would my royal Mistress blush disdainful  And sweet Elvira then reject my sword  Nor own my arm to prop her tottering Throne  Cruel remembrance of my original self  Cease cease to haunt and terrify my mind  Kings were once chosen from victorious soldiers  Who serves his Country needs no ancestry  For like the Sun He gives not borrows light  My Cottage blood has been exhausted all  In glory's field no drop of it remains  But it has bought me all my soul holds dear  The palm of victory and the wreath of fame  Behold she comes my rightful unown'd Queen  SCENE FOURTH  DONNA ELVIRA DON CARLOS  D ELVIRA  Ah Carlos scarcely can I call you Marquis  Although you merit your exalted rank  But then I wish'd myself to raise you to it  Why have the charms of glory thus seduc'd  Your wavering honour to desert that cause  To which your faith was pledg'd your sword devote  Your valour should compel the rebel Garcia  To yield obedience to my sovereign sway  Your sword held ready till I bade it strike  To place my longlost sceptre in my hand  Yet Count and with that selfsame sword your faith  To me engag'd you undertake to fight  Three single combats which are not for me  You have forgotten Count what Carlos promis'd  Back to the Queen resign Penafiel  Burgos and Santillane For trust me Arragon  Shall grateful give you more than you refuse  D CARLOS  Either as Carlos or as Marquis Madam  I nor forget nor will desert your rights  The traitor Garcia shall your victim fall  Yet though this sacrifice I owe to you  The Queen in gratitude first claims my sword  And highly it behoves the favour'd Marquis  To pay the mighty debt of humble Carlos  And to resent the outrage done the Queen  D ELVIRA  Did she intrust her ring with that intent  D CARLOS  When your bright Sex insulted wants a champion  Forbid it honour glory courage manhood  That they should need to stoop to ask for aid  Or intimate the means to right their cause  D ELVIRA  I think these combats might have been avoided  Unless the Counts had challeng'd you in arms  D CARLOS  Then had I been ungrateful and dishonour'd  Could disrespect assume an air more taunting  Than to assert with scornful insolence  That her high heart indulg'd a secret passion  Unworthy of herself Manrique averr'd it  And infamy would blot my name with cowardice  Not to stand forth in her most sacred cause  When duty honour gratitude command it  My royal Mistress in protecting me  Incurr'd this insult by her noble spirit  Sdeigning submission still the Count defy'd her  Forcing her new restrictions to invent  Or tamely shrink insulted on her throne  I must protect her rights assert her power  Maintain her cause her injuries avenge  That done my sword with heartfelt zeal is yours  D ELVIRA  Carlos I comprehend from this excuse  That the Queen's service is preferr'd to mine  Because her subject you break faith with me  D CARLOS  For her or you I feel an equal zeal  Your cause or hers is mine Nor have I seen  Aught yet of sleepless toil or perilous hazard  But what for either I would wish to encounter  Nay though engag'd to fight for her tomorrow  Sustain'd you wrong which this day call'd for vengeance  Instant would I expose my breast to more  Than Three such combats in your cause Elvira  Without reflecting what I ow'd the Queen  Misconstrue not the conduct which I hold  Nor wound my soul by undeserv'd reproaches  Know the high rank to which the Queen has rais'd me  Has but One charm for Me But as your champion  Donna Elvira are those honours priz'd  Which in the eye of undiscerning crowds  Will give respect to him who fights your battles  Beyond what unplum'd courage ever meets  D ELVIRA  To grace my cause I wanted but your valour  I can invest you with still higher honours  Them Marquis you disdain and me betray  D CARLOS  I wish'd but one reward from bright Elvira  I thought it minebut find myself deceiv'd  D ELVIRA  Deceiv'd my Lord by whom  D CARLOS  My own vain thoughts  For from your gentle manners I presum'd  That in esteem you held the humble Carlos  That in your breast such hallow'd friendship dwelt  As pure Religion with allhealing balm  Tells us the blest in the next world enjoy  Where all distinctions cease of earthly rank  But I was mock'd with visionary joy  The Queen of Arragon suspects my zeal  Changes the sweet complacence of her temper  For dark distrust anger and keen reproach  My mind feels anguish all unknown before  A comfortless dismay subdues my spirit  Joyless forlorn and desolate I seem  As if my Guardian Angel left his charge  And ev'ry cheering passion join'd his flight  D ELVIRA  If I be chang'd your conduct wrought the change  Anger suspicion and reproaches Carlos  Are not the natives of Elvira's breast  Your instability excites them all  Glory allures you to forget your faith  Which uncondition'd Marquis Carlos promis'd  My friendship brooks not this nor my esteem  I hear Alvarez enters first the Lists  You know the history of his faithful love  D CARLOS  Over Alvarez' soul I know your power  His virtues make him worthy of your heart  D ELVIRA  When you fight with him think of whom I love  And be his blood respected as your own  D CARLOS  Do you command me then to make him King  D ELVIRA  I only ask that you would think of me  I go in hopes of justice from the Queen  And if I can these combats to prevent    Exeunt severally    End of the Second Act  Act Third  SCENE FIRST  DONNA ELVIRA DON ALVAREZ  D ELVIRA  FORBEAR my Lord and chuse some other theme  How dare you to pretend you love me still  When in the Lists you fight to gain the Queen  What star malevolent thus rules your fate  Making your arm a traitor to your heart  D ALVAREZ  Imperious honour claims excuse from love  D ELVIRA  A lover's honour is fidelity  My Lord you now can have no hopes from me  To what does your ambitious heart pretend  D ALVAREZ  That you should pity a poor wretch's fate  Your cruelty involves in such distress  Oh could my faithful love have won your heart  This fatal honour never had been mine  The States would not have nam'd me as a suitor  Nor forced me by their choice to woo the Queen  Oh would to Heaven that I may either die  Or win the Queen but to acquire Elvira  D ELVIRA  Vain are your prayers to wish for miracles  Embrace the glittering prize which fortune offers  So much to your advantage is the change  That it wipes off that censure and disgrace  Which levity and fickleness excite  But yet beware Alvarez that brave Carlos  Does not avenge me to your glory's downfall  And make your pride repent of this desertion  D ALVAREZ  Princess this forc'd desertion more befriends me  Than have whole years of persevering love  When honour forces me to break my chains  How I rejoice to be so much esteem'd  As to excite your anger and resentment  D ELVIRA  Count you mistake the source of my displeasure  Much it offends me that you still persist  To persecute my heart when you forsake me  And that you term my coldness cruelty  Hope gave I none nor sought to gain that love  I fear'd my unwilling heart could never share  I own with gratitude your generous services  When Heaven's inflictions did most sore beset me  My best esteem must be your sole reward  A heart magnanimous expects no more  Nor seeks it to enslave whom it has serv'd  D ALVAREZ  Ah think me not so mean of soul to plead  Those services your sacred Sex commands  From valour's arm which I triumphant paid von  All the poor merit that Alvarez claims  Is from try'd love and constant adoration  Too happy had I been could these have won you  D ELVIRA  No Consort will I chuse till I am Queen  The nuptial tie no hero shall involve  In my disastrous fortunes to his ruin  Europe through all her States has no alliance  For Isabel or me no King nor Prince  Whose power might safely combat for my Kingdom  And should my present shining prospects fade  Had I the meanness to accept your hand  My Wars would drain the treasures of your House  For when contending Monarchs play for Empires  The noblest fortune scarcely pays  one  stake  An undisputed and more splendid Throne  Presents itself to your unsteady love  Willing perhaps it found your heart to share it  D ALVAREZ  No 'T was your cruelty expos'd me to it  When on a rock you drive me to destruction  Then you revile the shipwreck you have caus'd  D ELVIRA  I blame you not that you accept this fortune  More favour'd lovers might have listen'd to it  Yet be what will the motives of your conduct  With much less warmth it might have been embrac'd  But  you  fight first and this impatient zeal  Proclaims with how much joy you break the chains  Of illrequited love and gain your liberty  D ALVAREZ  How could you bear the people should behold  Your lover the most cowardly of the Three  Not daring to attack this glorious Carlos  Till first his rivals had his force exhausted  D ELVIRA  Those rivals come with them my Lord I leave you    Exit D Elvira    SCENE SECOND  DON MANRIQUE DON ALVAREZ DON LOPEZ  D MANRIQUE  Which treats you best Alvarez Love or Fortune  Can the Queen charm so near the bright Elvira  D ALVAREZ  When I have won the Ring I will declare  D LOPEZ  'T is thought that Carlos rivals you in both  And gives you cause for jealousy's keen pangs  D ALVAREZ  He makes more jealous than myself I fear  D LOPEZ  Through pity he should yield you one or t' other  Ending the contest who shall make him King  The fair Castile and Arragon both wish it  Two Queens in beauty's prime both sigh for Carlos  D ALVAREZ  Then let that thought our lofty spirits humble  Though pride and honour storm with giant strength  Love gives the palm where justice might decree it  D MANRIQUE  Yet you defy this idol of your praise  D ALVAREZ  My Lord my honour is distinct from pride  Honour impels me to demand the Lists  And pride alone could make me scorn brave Carlos  D MANRIQUE  The Queen has order'd us to meet her here  But on what subject to confer we know not  This is a day of wonders and caprice  But you Alvarez patient bear each change  With calm indifference and stoic apathy  Whilst various torments rack my burning soul  And love and pride by turns my bosom rule  SCENE THIRD  DONNA ISABELLA DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ DON ALVAREZ  D ISABELLA  Leave us Alvarez I to these Counts would speak  On matters of concernment to myself  Your interest shall obtain my best regard  You shall find all the favour you can wish  D ALVAREZ  When you command I know but to obey    Exit D Alvarez    SCENE FOURTH  DONNA ISABELLA DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ  D ISABELLA  I will remove all cause of discontent  And since my choice more honour will confer  I will reclaim my Ring and chuse myself  But from my choice Alvarez I exclude  Yet the sole cause of this exclusion Lords  Is that I know he loves the Queen of Arragon  In one of you I view the future King  D MANRIQUE    kneeling    O Madam how your words transport my soul  E'en whilst I tremble between hope and fear  If Lopez win you I shall be less wretched  Resigning you to such a worthy Lover  Speak Madam my impetuous soul eager  With hope demands to know my bliss or woe  D ISABELLA  RiseEre I speak my choice fain would I see  Some certain proof that 't is myself you love  And not the splendour of my sovereign Rank  Counts I shall think myself most lov'd by him  Who can my sentiments and thoughts adopt  Like whom I like and whom I hate despise  D LOPEZ  Lest we mistake your will speak plainly Madam  D ISABELLA  If I have liberal been to valiant Carlos  Let me behold in you a like esteem  Honour his virtues do his merit justice  For ne'er presume I will a Consort chuse  To have the King I make my work destroy  Reclaim my favours or disgrace my friends  Therefore let neither hope to share my Throne  Till something worthy on your parts confirms  What I have done for Carlos that by such act  I may remain assur'd the structure which  My gratitude has rear'd shall not be raz'd  For I must know it safe from storm or stratagem  D MANRIQUE  Don Carlos Madam is most highly honour'd  His happiness so much employs your thoughts  Ours is to his inthrall'd yet since to honour him  Is to please you instruct us how to act  The Palm of Victory nor the Trump of Fame  Ne'er gave renown to one more brave than Carlos  He is most worthy your munificence  And well deserves to be what you have made him  Our gratitude to him indebted stands  And we wish'd largely to acknowledge it  D LOPEZ  But after you we can do nothing for him  Carlos is rais'd above our power to favour  What is there in our power left to propose  That would not be a degradation to him  D ISABELLA  Gifts in your power there are he might accept  Gifts that would clear your names from black ingratitude  And free my anxious mind from its disquiet  Gifts which without disgrace he might possess  D LOPEZ  Then name them Madam Power and not will we lack  To clear us from this charge of black ingratitude  D ISABELLA  Counts you have each a Sister 'T is my will  That He whom I shall please to chuse for King  When he receives my hand at the same Altar  Shall to the Warrior Carlos give his Sister    The Counts testify by their looks much surprise    Embrace him as his Brother and his Friend  And thus secure him from my Husband's enmity  Not that I need to fear his hate to Carlos  As in Castile I shall be always Queen  For the new King whate'er his project be  Will though inthron'd be only my first subject  But to exert my plenitude of power  Over the heart to which I gave my own  Would pain my inmost soul in the extreme  I urge this union as of strife preventive  Then answer Will ye give your full consent  D MANRIQUE  Yes Queen our full consentto doom us both  To the most cruel death rather than see  The bright pure honours of a thousand years  By such a marriage in one moment tarnish'd  Too dear an Empire at a price like this  D ISABELLA  Thus then audacious Count thus then you testify  That Carlos is most worthy my munificence  And well deserves to be what I have made him  Thus to except against the Rank I give  Proud Manrique is to scorn my sovereign power  D MANRIQUE  I do not Queen dispute your power to exalt  Carlos or whom you please e'en to our Rank  No Sovereign stands accountable for dignities  Which he confers or gifts his liberality  Bestows If he support or raise the unworthy  'T is his own work and the shame all his own  But to disgrace by misalliance blood  Which from my Ancestors unsully'd flows  No Monarch ever shall by my consent  First be it on a Public Scaffold spilt  Rather than know such vile contamination  Mine from inheritance I owe account of it  To my brave Ancestors and all Posterity  Pure from my great Forefathers I receiv'd it  Pure shall it still remain or cease to flow  D ISABELLA  Then Manrique I who owe account to no one  Will of your vaunted noble blood dispose  Be mine the shame of its contamination  What mad extravagance makes you presume  To think I should propose what would dishonour you  How dare you to suspect me of such turpitude  What law of rectitude or nicest honour  Have I infring'd throughout my Life proud Lord  Or what disgrace incurr'd I know of none  But what I now incurbeing forc'd to wed  Degrading thoughtthe Vassal of my Crown  Whowhilst I thus descendscorns to intrust  His honour to my careSay in what character  Subject or Lover dare you to treat me thus  D LOPEZ  Pardon the ardour which infatuates him  And makes him disrespectful in his speech  In marriage both our Sisters are betroth'd  D ISABELLA  To whom  D MANRIQUE  His Sister Madam is to me affianc'd  D ISABELLA    to Manrique    To whom is yours engag'd  D MANRIQUE  To Lopez Madam  D ISABELLA  Then I am wrong in making either King  Go happy Lovers go to your chosen Mistresses  And to enhance the value of your love  Tell them with what contemptuous galling scorn  You have a Queen insulted and disdain'd  A throneRetire We hold no further conference  D LOPEZ    kneeling    Yet hear us Madam  D ISABELLA  And what have you to urge  To speak in praise of constancy in love  And that no earthly grandeur should seduce it  If 't is a crime to violate this virtue  I too perhaps my Lords may learn to practise it  D LOPEZ  Practise it MadamBut permit us first  To explain ourselves that you may fully know  Don Manrique's heart and mine where you reign absolute  As Queen respected and ador'd as Mistress  Your choice will make the one on whom it falls  Supremely bless'd the other doom to woe  But to prevent all jealous feuds between us  A mutual promise binds us in one interest  If he be chosen then I wed his Sister  If I obtain you mine with him unites  Thus Carlos cannot to the King be brother  D ISABELLA  And know you not that being what you are  The feudatory Vassals of my State  Your Sisters are my Subjects and on me  DependWithout my order and expressly  Against my will in marriage to engage them  Is to usurp my Throne and give  me  law  D MANRIQUE  Assert your high prerogative as Sovereign  Command us as the Vassals of your State  Do not  request  unless we may  refuse    Command  we at our peril must obey  D LOPEZ  But Queen remembernever will consent  D MANRIQUE  And yet in deference to your election  Thus far we will recede through love and duty  Carlos is generous and he knows his birth  Let him in secret judge upon that knowledge  And if his blood be worthy of such union  To us let him this marriage then propose  And we the alliance shall an honour deem  He has free choice to wed one of our Sisters  If after knowing these strict terms he dare  'T is at his peril if his birth be mean  Thus far we stoop to gain our royal Mistress  Modest let Carlos be or else this marriage  Must in innumerable evils plunge him  D ISABELLA  Yourself take care lest him too much disdaining  I teach you what a Queen should do how reign  Retire my LordsI wish to be alone  SCENE FIFTH  DONNA ISABELLA alone  Whence this mysterious mutiny in both  When their obedience would a Throne obtain  Does it arise from pride from envy springs it  Is it malignity contempt defiance  Or can it be that noble generous spirit  Which wrestles with the power its fortune wants  Fearing complacency might falsely seem  Like a vile parasite through interest courteous  Perhaps 't is Heaven's high hand that interferes  Yet whereforeMy weak sense searches in vain  Why wars affection with my fame and glory  If only by these cruel ceaseless conflicts  Of reason pride and shame love is control'd  Grant me the fortune Heaven I dare not take  And since for me thou hast not made a King  To the most worthy of my Subjects give me  Inspire my people let them name Don Carlos  SCENE SIXTH  DONNA ISABELLA BLANCHE  D ISABELLA  I have mispent my time The haughty Counts  At such a price refuse the Diadem  BLANCHE  I Madam am return'd successless too  For Carlos on such terms rejects all fortune  D ISABELLA  What Is he bent to render hate for hate  And for contemptcontempt  BLANCHE  Oh no far otherwise  The Sisters of the Counts he much esteems  Thinks them deserving of a Monarch's love  D ISABELLA  Why does he then reject this high alliance  BLANCHE  Some secret obstacle obstructs your plan  For though obscure and all confus'd his speech  I could perceive a something from his words  As if some vow of constancy were made  And his whole soul were wedded to the object  D ISABELLA  Ahdoes he love elsewhere  BLANCHE  I judge so Madam  D ISABELLA  Whom does he love  BLANCHE  One of exalted Rank  ISABELLA  Alasbut tell me whom  BLANCHE  He loves a Queen  D ISABELLA  He loves a QueenElvira is his choice  He quits Castile and goes with her to Arragon  Love and not Glory makes him quit my Court  BLANCHE  You should desire his absence as the means  To root this fatal passion from your heart  D ISABELLA  Have I to lose him aggrandiz'd him then  And shall a Queen in the same cradle nurs'd with me  Rear'd and protected by my Royal Parents  Castile her refuge and her sole defence  Shall sheungrateful as this traitor Carlos  Rob me of what I priz'd the most of Carlos  Of ungrateful artful Carlos rob me  I will not take such pains to save his life  No let the ingrate fight and let him die  BLANCHE  Why should his love or his retreat offend you  I know not which he loves you or Elvira  Nor can I comprehend your wrathful Jealousy  D ELVIRA  Then thou hast never love's disquiet known  Stormy and fearful does it make my mind  And tempests every feeling of my heart  Elvira has no loftiness no pride  More generous more exalted than myself  She with the noble spirit of a Queen  Bestows her Crown she is belov'd ador'd  Whilst I amleft scorn'd hated and renounc'd  My pride that dares not chuse him King yet brooks not  His desertion  BLANCHE  Since you respect your honour  Too much to chuse him King why wish his heart  D ISABELLA  I love himCan I bear to be disdain'd  No let him doating to distraction love me  Yet so respect me never to break silence  BLANCHE  Respect Your SelfCombat conceal this passion  D ISABELLA  Carlos contemns me he can reign without me  He loves Elvira hence his false respect  That dar'd not love me but as Heaven is lov'd  She loves him too and to a Throne will raise him  The Queen her Mother is indulgent Blanche  And her consent will sanctify their union  A Parent's Judgment justifies the Child  Elvira loves him and will make him King  BLANCHE  Madam 't is said she will not now be Queen  For Fame reports that yet her Brother lives  D ISABELLA  It cannot be he died in early infancy  BLANCHE  I but declare the rumour which I heard  That this Prince is not dead and that he comes  Now with th' expected Deputies from Arragon  D ISABELLA  The Queen of Arragon believes him dead  But in a Son restor'd to prop her state  How will her sorrowing widow'd heart rejoice  Let mine though lost to ev'ry hope of bliss  Expand benevolent to greet her joy    Exit followed by Blanche    End of the Third Act  Act Fourth  SCENE FIRST  DONNA LEONORA DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ  D MANRIQUE  ACCEPT our joint congratulations Madam  That Heaven restores a Son you mourn'd as dead  For though a Throne and Queen in beauty's bloom  Were never yielded but with strong regret  Although to one of us they both are promis'd  We seeing a King competitor resign them  Before the States revoke their choice of us  The Prince your  Son  back to your arms restor'd  Shall find us faithful Subjects Till he claims  These his high rights accept for him our homage  D LOPEZ  We mourn as Lovers but rejoice as patriots  Our faithful hearts are to the State devoted  Therefore we ardent wish Castile with Arragon  To be united firm by this Alliance  That their leagu'd forces may the Moors subdue  Unblushing we resign this glorious fortune  Which whilst it honour'd us our Queen degraded  Let Isabella and Don Sancho reign  D LEONORA  My Lords this gen'rous resignation flatters  Too soon my new rais'd hopesAlas what hopes  My princely Son in infancy expir'd  And this report excites my grief and wonder  Opens the sources of my woes afresh  Renews my sorrow for my firstborn hope  With all the yearning anguish mothers know  Who mourn an only Son's untimely death  Oh did he live now might his arm protect  His own his Sister's and his Mother's cause  D LOPEZ  Doubtless for this Heaven has preserv'd your Son  D LEONORA  Alas my Lord He has not been preserv'd  Nineteen long years I o'er his tomb have wept  He cannot be aliveunless some miracle  From Heaven's high hand compels the yawning grave  To yield its preyAll that concerns my Son  I will relate then judge if this report  Have aught on which a Mother's hope may build  I will not trace my troubles to their source  For Arragon's revolt and Garcia's usurpation  From my long biding here must be well known  D MANRIQUE  Oft from our Fathers have we heard your woes  How Ferdinand was from his Kingdom driven  And you ere eighteen summers' suns had grac'd  Your brow were forc'd to seek for shelter here  Before the fair Elvira saw the light  Thus much we know in what remains instruct us  D LEONORA  Just as Don Ferdinand beheld the Rebel Garcia  Ready to mount his Throne my Son was born  Don Sancho was my hapless infant nam'd  From barbarous Garcia's fury to protect him  My royal Husband urg'd me to consent  To his conveyance to a safe retreat  The place where Ferdinand conceal'd my Child  I never knew  D MANRIQUE  Had you no clew to trace him  That so one Day you might reclaim your Son  D LEONORA  My husband with our Infant tokens sent  Mine and his Portrait with a braid of hair  Pledge of my love ere yet my bridal day  And a deed written by Ferdinand himself  That own'd and that identify'd our Son  These in an iron Casket were inclos'd  Its secret spring known but to him and me  Ah these precautions prov'd but useless care  Twelve Moons had scarcely wan'd when my Child dy'd  Ere I again had clasp'd him to my breast  D LOPEZ  Perhaps some false report might then deceive you  We came expecting you could solve our doubts  And realize the hope and wish of all  To find your Son in a most valiant hero  Fain would I hope this rumour may prove true  And that your Son still lives to glad your eyes  D LEONORA  Oh 't is impossible His Father he himself  Told the dire tale He saw my babe expire  Catch'd his last breathand clos'd his beamless eyes  D MANRIQUE  Would we could doubt the truth of his report  D LEONORA  A Year of woe and bloody contest pass'd  Then Ferdinand rejoin'd his son in death  Within my arms he died His last words were  "  Don Raymond has in charge when time shall be  "  A most important secret for thy ear  "  Fly to Castile live for our unborn Infant  "  Long did I hope this secret was my Son  But Raymond never gave me hope it was  Raymond is lost and I shall never know it  Five years are pass'd since he was prisoner made  By Garcia's spies I fear they murder'd him  Too faithful to my cause brave Raymond perish'd  SCENE SECOND  DONNA LEONORA DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ DON ALVAREZ  D LEONORA  Hast thou learn'd Count whence this report arises  D ALVAREZ  Don Raymond lives by me he greets you Madam  D LEONORA  For my true Servant's life kind Heaven I thank thee  D ALVAREZ  More joy awaits you Queen  D LEONORA    with wild ecstasy    Have I a Son  D ALVAREZ  Don Sancho lives  D LEONORA  Oh lead melet me see him  Weep on his neck and clasp him in my arms  My Sonmy SonYet can it be Great God  Oh bring me to him make me know he lives    Going    D ALVAREZ  staying the Queen    Don Raymond seeks him  D LEONORA  Seeks him Oh all is false    Leans halffainting upon D Manrique    I hop'd him come with Raymond this the secret  Which dying Ferdinand declar'd he knew  D ALVAREZ  Madam it is And Raymond seeks Don Sancho  Here in this Court  D LEONORA  Ah vain research Alvarez  Will you conduct Don Raymond hither to me  D ALVAREZ  He to the assembled troops is gone in hopes  To find Don Sancho midst their Captains  Don Raymond join'd the Deputies from Arragon  After their messengers were sent to announce  To you their near approach Then he declar'd  That their Prince liv'd that here he hop'd to find him  As in the armies of Castile he long has serv'd  I will seek Raymond Madam but so eagerly  Do your brave Arragonians press around him  Their Prince demanding that I doubt to bring  Him hither I must bring the whole wild multitude  SCENE THIRD  DONNA LEONORA DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ  D MANRIQUE  As here Don Raymond seeks him I believe  Either that Heaven has torn Don Sancho from you  Or that he lives in the Illustrious Carlos  D LEONORA  Carlos my LordAnd thinks Don Manrique thus  D LOPEZ  This is the thought and wish of a whole People  When it was known that here your son was sought  All with one voice exclaim'd "He must be Carlos"  We judg'd that you could have explain'd the mystery  And therefore sought your presence to explore it  D MANRIQUE  Madam though envious of Carlos deem'd  I own that his whole life since we have known him  Throughout its wondrous course appears one miracle  Himself and fortune almost supernatural  His high strung virtue that enchants all minds  His lofty valour which transcends my praise  His port majestic and his winning mien  Give him access beyond a Subject's reach  To thrones Two Queens all emulous strive  Who shall esteem and honour him the most  Nay e'en from love can scarce defend their hearts  The prompt respect of an adoring People  Who like some god gaze at him as he passes  All with resistless evidence evinces  That valiant Carlos is your longlost Son  D LEONORA  In such a Son how might a Mother triumph  But yet beware my Lords how you inspire  The thought that Carlos is my longmourn'd Child  Lest I mistake a woman's conscious pride  That would exult to own a Son like him  For Nature's sacred voice within my breast  He has a Prince's spirit not his birth  Himself by his own conduct this attests  Leaving the Queen to chuse amongst her Subjects  The Partner of her royal bed and Throne  D MANRIQUE  See you not Madam that his princely spirit  Prepares to gain this conquest o'er all three  Have you forgotten what he said before you  "  I will owe nought to those who gave me life  "  Nobly his heart resigns that high advantage  To owe his greatness only to his courage  D LOPEZ  Behold him we shall know from him the truth  SCENE FOURTH  DONNA LEONORA DON CARLOS DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ    Carlos enters with precipitation Donna Leonora flies to him with open arms Carlos retreats    D LEONORA  Am I so bless'd to have a Son like Thee  A mother's happinessa widow's joy  Hangs on thy answerCarlos art thou my Son  Speak ere a Mother's exstasy of hope  O'ercomes my soul and my arms clasp thy neck  If thou be alien to my blood O speak  But let my longlost Son come to my arms  D CARLOS  O Queen I grieve to find this errour spread  Reserve these transports for your happy Son  I am not heI sought you to complain  And beg release from an offensive honour  The People obstinately bent to take  Away my name declare I am Don Sancho  And Prince of Arragon His presence soon  Will prove how much mistaking they have been  In thinking me that Prince I am rais'd up  The phantom of an hour Such cruel mockery  Abases you O Queen as well as Carlos  D LEONORA  Oft is the People's voice the voice of Heaven  Impulsively at once it bursts inspir'd  D LOPEZ  My Lord we know from wellconfirm'd report  That in the armies of Castile Don Sancho serves  Unknown 't is true save to himself alone  Therefore all eyes are fix'd on you as one  Whose dazzling merit speaks exalted Rank  No longer Prince deny what Heaven proclaims  You have obliged us to transgress against you  When you should not have forc'd our disrespect  Our high esteem for Carlos was well known  Our pride warr'd not with him but with his birth  Though Carlos we disdain'd yet we respect  Don Sancho will accept him for our Monarch  When to our Queen he deigns to own himself  Quit your disguise my Lord and as Don Sancho  And our chosen King receive our loyal homage    They take off their hats and with their right hands upon their hearts they bow    D CARLOS  This false respect with which you have surpris'd me  Is more injurious Counts than your contempt  I thought this strange report the work of chance  Not doubting any bold enough to dare  To make a pageant King of me for sport  Is this the jest of your exuberant spirits  Then learn gay Lords that the brave honour valour  And that your equals in the field respect  Nor make of mine a mockery a maygame  If this be your intent first vanquish then  Deride me victorious you may railly me  With grace Now you anticipate your privilege  The Queen's Ring still I guard and this derided  Carlos his family and race unknown  The sceptre of Castile from you withholds  This arm which from captivity redeem'd you  May still control and humble your ambition  D MANRIQUE  Your speech is that of Monarch not of Carlos  Your mien assumes the prince though you deny it  We still defend the honour of our rank  Though prompt to pay what we hop'd due to yours  Madam we leave to you to explain this mystery  A secret charm for Carlos pleads most strongly  But you can best develop Nature's voice  We go lest by his pride Carlos should force us  To lay aside that high respect we owe you  SCENE FIFTH  DONNA LEONORA CARLOS  D CARLOS  Madam you see with what contempt they treat me  D LEONORA  Leave this dispute and speak we of Don Sancho  These Lords though proud yet generously declare  That in this Court no Stranger but yourself  Has of a Prince disguis'd the port and virtues  That if Don Sancho live he lives in you  Say are you well acquainted with your birth  D CARLOS  Alas I amWere I some Infant winds  And waves had spar'd some little wretch forlorn  By parents in a desert leftto milder beasts  Expos'dthrough hatred fear or cruel shame  By hazard sound and from kind pity nurtur'd  My pride at this report would rise to hope  Beholding you thus doubtful thus distress'd  For I am high of heart and most ambitious  Sceptres and diadems transport my soul  And my presumptuous mind impetuous soars  Beyond all bounds in useless idle flights  Whilst a few warlike deeds sustain vain thoughts  Sudden my eyes cast inward they are dash'd  From godlike heights to deep humiliation  I know my ParentsI am not Don Sancho  He with your Deputies perhaps is come  And a few hours will bring him to your arms  D LEONORA  The Counts have lighted in my mind a hope  I fain would cherishAlways I esteem'd you  A secret movement in despite of me  Inclin'd me ever to admire nay love you  And something now intuitively strong  Within my breast disowns your words and says  You are deceiving me or else deceiv'd  What animates me thus I cannot tell  Whether the ardour of a Mother's love  Or admiration for transcendent merit  Whether the sacred voice of Nature speaks  Or my esteem pays tribute to your worth  Whether my heart drawn by mysterious instinct  Thus owns its blood or my soul makes a choice  D CARLOS  Such thoughts as these deceive their followers  As the nightmeteor travellers misleads  They are delusions all Then Queen resist them  If the least gleam of dawning hope could rise  Within my breast that I your Son could be  Think with what towering joy what exultation  I at your feet should fall and claim your love  The lofty pride of my aspiring mind  Would glory to be Master of a Throne  But with a dearer triumph would rejoice  In such a Mother whose exalted rank  Is less conspicuous than her longtry'd virtues  Againwith solemn truthI reassure you  I know my ParentsI am not Don Sancho  D LEONORA  With pain my heart relinquishes the thought  O God of Heaven hadst thou for me preserv'd  A Son like this how would my widow'd heart  Exult with joy and praise thy wondrous mercy  How should I glory if thou wert my Son  D CARLOS  Would that I were but I am not so bless'd  D LEONORA  Since you deny it you are not my Son  No longer hide your Birth reveal this mystery  However high your thoughts may have aspir'd  Carlos my condemnation fear not  So great is my esteem that in your favour  My prosperous fortune and my regal power  I will exert to honour and distinguish you  E'en to the height of most ambitious thoughts  I think your virtues worthy of a Throne  If noble blood flow in your veins Don Carlos  A fate awaits you will reward your merits  D CARLOS  The secret of myselfmust rest with  me    Never to mortal ear to be reveal'd  D LEONORA  If with this secret you will not intrust me  At least refuse me not another boon  Which as a Mother earnestly I crave  D CARLOS  Name it For you Elvira and the Queen  I live and in the cause of each had I  Ten thousand lives I would expend them all  D LEONORA  The boon I ask is to withdraw your services  We now can reign without your succour Carlos  The death of Garcia has repair'd his crimes  And renders Arragon back to its Sovereign  A child of mine in peace now mounts its Throne  Don Sancho if he live or else my Daughter  No longer then prepare to follow us  Constrain us not that honour to accept  With candour Carlos does a Mother own  That with such dazzling virtues much she fears you  To judgment such as yours this may suffice  D CARLOS  Why must I thus be treated in extremes  Lov'd as a Son or hated as a foe  In what do I offend Whence your disdain  Why of the only joy I had bereave me  D LEONORA  Brave youth I see with grief the pain you feel  Your birth conceal'd commands this conduct from me  In me 't is prudent and to you most friendly  I but prevent the wretchedness of all  Forbidding hopes which never must be answer'd  I am constrain'd your service to relinquish  D CARLOS  I thought my griefs had reach'd their worst extreme  But this rejection of my humble aid  Wounds with a pang I never thought to feel  The last bright ray that cheer'd my lonely mind  It is your pleasure to obscure for ever  The Sun will never rise for me again  D LEONORA  Farewell grateful I thank the zeal you shew'd  To serve our cause I hold you generous Carlos  In high esteemrespect youbeyond words  Accept a friend's best wishes who regrets you  May ev'ry blessing Heaven reserves for virtue  Your portion be may peace content and honour  Make your life happy and long flourish round you  When next your happy Mother's arms shall clasp you  Tell her she has more joy than Thrones can give  A joy I would were mine a Son like you  Speak notThis moment rends my heartmay Heaven    The Queen retires with precipitation much agitated    SCENE SIXTH  DON CARLOS BLANCHE  BLANCHE  What can thus agitate the Queen my Lord  D CARLOS  Her just rejection and disdain of me  BLANCHE  Disdain a hero who is own'd for King  D CARLOS  Fair Lady aid not envy thus to mock me  I have no claim to such a glorious title  BLANCHE  The Queen herself believes you Prince of Arragon  To her your silence has been most ungrateful  Her generosity to valiant Carlos  Deserv'd the instant thanks e'en of Don Sancho  I came to summon your attendance on her  And see she comes to give you audience here    Exit Blanche    SCENE SEVENTH  DONNA ISABELLA DON CARLOS  D ISABELLA  Why has Don Sancho thus conceal'd himself  I dare not offer gratulations to him  Those he despises since he would not claim them  Rejecting his advantages as King  D CARLOS  I have no claim to gratulations Madam  You are deceiv'd in thinking me Don Sancho  Permit me instantly to quit Castile  And shun the gathering storm that threats my head  D ISABELLA  What can you fear What thus appals you Marquis  Because a Monarch deem'd are you offended  When your own virtues force us to presume it  If not Don Sancho tell me who you are  Though you disdain'd when brav'd to name your race  Yet I entreat you now confide in me  D CARLOS  Already is my secret half betray'd  In vain I hid my country and my race  In vain assum'd another name disdainful  Hating the one fate gave me at my birth  My Name and Country are discovered both  I am of Arragonthere Sancho nam'd  Thus much this fatal errour has unravell'd  I fear Fate's malice will disclose the rest  And soon reveal with shame and dire disgrace  What Count what Marquis you have deign'd to make  D ISABELLA  Have I nor power nor courage to protect  The structure I have rear'd Who shall destroy it  Then trust me Carlos trust me with this secret  As to a chosen and most zealous friend  And I who wrought your fortune will maintain it  D CARLOS  Let me depart ere I a victim fall  To the dire fate that menaces me here  And screen myself from what its wrath prepares  D ISABELLA  Count you deceive me this weak idle fear  Is love's pretence to quit my Court and Kingdom  Hence your disdain of the fair Bride I offer'd you  Go into Arragon Your Princess follow  Go openly nor thus descend to counterfeit  Since your proud heart is by her charms enslav'd  Do not abase yourself to ask my leave  Depart triumphant in despite of  me    To go without my knowledge is less insult  Than to depart against my prohibition  D CARLOS  In mercy Madam add not to my woes  Your cruel scorn and undeserv'd reproach  D ISABELLA  Why then delude me with evasive art  Act from one motive and another own  For such deceit is most ungrateful Carlos  You love Elviratherefore quit my Court  D CARLOS  No Madam no I love not bright Elvira  Though I would fight her cause and die to serve her  Death is my only wish 't is the sole good  Heaven has in store for me  D ISABELLA  Whence this despair  Art thou not grac'd by fortune's richest gifts  And has not Nature with a lavish hand  Endow'd thee amply with her choicest blessings  Who is more envy'd Carlos than thyself  Then why repine and whence this strange despondency  Is it within the compass of my power  To cure thy griefsSpeak for I wish thee happy  D CARLOS  Canst thou reverse the stern decrees of Heaven  And by a miracle change nature's course  Annul the past from memory's fix'd record  And change the future destiny of things  D ISABELLA  I understand a sorrow in your words  But not their purport Carlos What afflicts you  D CARLOS  A cureless grief which I must never speak  Which till it almost bursts my heart has borne  For pity's sake O Queen no more reproach me  But grant me leave to spend in solitude  My rest of daysI must notcannot stay  D ISABELLA  Though to a friend's entreaties you are silent  Yet surely to a Queen some reason 's due  For quitting thus her service and her Court  How can you justify this sudden conduct  So strange and so unlike the intrepid Carlos  D CARLOS    wildly    Adoring you I cease to be myself  No more I wish for fame nor value life  Oh must I see you in another's arms  My mind is fir'd to phrenzy at the thought  Love envy and despair uproot my soul  I thought to hide this secret in the grave  I sought to die without offending you  But love this day dethrones my feeble reason    Kneels    Can you forgive a wretch who on the rack  Has fail'd in firmness and breath'd forth one sigh  Which though repented cannot be recall'd  For you my heart felt the first pulse of love  A heaven inspir'd emotion undebas'd  By self regard or thought of due return  Hopeless I sigh'd nor one fond wish dar'd form  I go for evermust I go unpardon'd    The Queen turns weeping to him    Madam you weep Oh whence proceed those tears  D ISABELLA  Carlos  stops unable to speak    D CARLOS  O IsabellaO my royal mistress  What have I done Have I fresh cause for anguish  Those tearsburst they from aught but indignation  Scorn were less poignant to my tortur'd mind  Than to have griev'd your heart or caus'd one tear  And can I askYespity me and frown  Your anger that will lacerate my heart  Will glad my soul when reason reigns again  D ISABELLA  'Gainst one who so unwillingly offends  I feel no angerCarlos you are pardon'd    Signs to him to rise    D CARLOS  That pardon is more dear than all your gifts  Madam receive your Ring revoke your trust  I must depart and hide my guilty head  D ISABELLA    irresolute after a pause    Stay till the Prince of Arragon appears  Give him my Ring A Queen for all the favours  She has bestow'd entreats that one from  you    D CARLOS  O Madam let me shun impending fate  If I obey you I incur its wrath  The haughty Counts seek to dishonour me  I would preserve my honour to my grave  Let my heart burst with grief but not with shame  D ISABELLA  Stay till Don Sancho comes ere you depart  Let me in this commandoblige me Carlos  D CARLOS  Oh fatal mandate but your will is law  You doom me Queen to what is worse than death  To contumelious scorn from those who hate me  Yetif you wish itwhy should I repine  I'll stay and brave the malice of my fate  When you command I have no selfregard  D ISABELLA  Why art thou not Don Sancho hapless Carlos  O Heavenbelieve me notwhat have I said    Going    D CARLOS  What with strange magic tortures and delights  Consoles me whilst it wounds my aching sense  What has charm'd all the horrours of my fate  What I most joy to hear yet grieve to know    Exeunt severally    End of the Fourth Act  Act Fifth  SCENE FIRST  DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA  D ELVIRA  HAS aught appear'd to justify the rumour  That Heaven in Carlos sends you back a Son  D LEONORA  The haughty Counts and the whole Court agree  That Carlos is Don Sancho and my Son  D ELVIRA  He is my brother then  D LEONORA  No my Elvira  Carlos that name disowns I have just seen him  And 't was an interview that pain'd my soul  SCENE SECOND  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA  D ISABELLA  Let me not interrupt but share your converse  If it regard your Son what have you learn'd  D LEONORA  No more enlighten'd are we than yourself  But wait with doubtful wonder and impatience  To have this fateful mystery unravell'd  D ISABELLA  But from whom comes the news of Garcia's death  And this report so widely spread so eagerly  Receiv'd that your Son lives The different couriers  Who for this month arrive come but with Treaties  From Arragon revolted in your favour  Its Deputies by your appointment come  This Day to swear Allegiance to their Queen  But of Don Sancho's life or Garcia's death  Why has the information been delay'd  D LEONORA  Nor my Son's life nor Garcia's death were known  Till Raymond join'd last night the Deputies  When first from Saragossa they departed  Our party were besieging in their last fortress  The traitor Garcia and his rebel Son  They being slain the garrison surrender'd  And Raymond who was prisoner there set free  He instantly proclaim'd that their Prince liv'd  And he set out with speed to seek Don Sancho  Thinking with him to o'ertake the Deputies  Who of his Life or Garcia's death were ignorant  Last night he join'd them after their Messengers  To me had been dispatch'd and he inform'd them  That their young Prince resides here in your Court  All anxious as I am no more I know  I have not yet seen Raymond so intent  Is he in searching for my Son throughout  Your hosts But here each moment I expect him  D ISABELLA  going    I hope he comes to bring you certain tidings  Fearing to interrupt I leave you Madam  D LEONORA  Remain For this report concerns us equally  If my Son live a Monarch claims your hand  And heaven rewards  you  for your Fathers virtues  That Crown he strove to gain for my Elvira  Shall by his Child be worn Thus whilst he toil'd  For others good he aggrandiz'd his Race  D ELVIRA  My Friend henceforth my Sister and my Queen  Heaven has decreed my Diadem to you  Reign with my Brother and be happy long  SCENE THIRD  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE  D LEONORA  What news brings Blanche with that astonish'd look  Is my Son found  BLANCHE  No Madam no  D ISABELLA  What agitates thee thus  BLANCHE  O cruel fateOh Why did Carlos stay  D ISABELLA  Speak What of Him  BLANCHE  Dishonour'd and undone  D ELVIRA  Dishonour'd BlancheCarlos dishonour'd  It cannot be  BLANCHE  His Father is arriv'd  A peasant Shepherd is the Sire of Carlos  D ISABELLA  Who told thee this  BLANCHE  I saw their meeting Madam  And all the court is witness to the fact  D ISABELLA  I scarcely know to credit thy report  D ELVIRA  Ah fortune how unjust  D ISABELLA  Unjust indeed  Is this great soul and virtue so sublime  Sprung from a beggar's raceWhat then is blood  If Carlos He whose high heroic worth  Deserves the Throne his prowess oft has guarded  Was in a cottage born from shepherd parents  Has Manrique's blood or my own royal stream  E'er form'd a hero that transcends this Carlos  And though he sprung in an ungenial soil  His vigorous soul throve midst its scanty nurture  And pair'd with princes nurs'd by fortune's hand  D ELVIRA  And must this trueborn Eagle be disdain'd  Because his aërie was not plac'd on high  Men should take rank not from their birth but virtue  D ISABELLA  But how did Carlos bear this sad reverse  BLANCHE  Oh with deep anguish and exalted courage  Along the audiencehall he graceful walk'd  And ever and anon with courteous speech  Check'd the false rumour as he pass'd the crowd  But all your court was bent to change his name  And murmur'd round "Don Sancho Prince of Arragon"  When a poor mean old man in shepherd's garb  Burst through your guards and clasp'd him in his arms  "Why didst thou leave me in my age" he cried  Carlos turn'd pale then blush'd from pride and shame  But duty triumph'd and the hero wept  He clasp'd his aged Parent to his breast  And "O my Father" "O my longlost Son"  Echo'd responsive midst their sighs and tears  D ISABELLA  Disdainful of his birth he loves his Sire  Nature and Virtue rule his noble soul  BLANCHE  Though strange to tell these cries of grief and joy  Were disbeliev'd The court around them gather'd  And this poor peasant Shepherd spite of Carlos  Is deem'd dishonest torn from his arms  And roughly treated 'T is a cheat they cry  A dark impostor by the Counts suborn'd  To throw disgrace on Carlos and excuse  Their proud refusal of the proffer'd combat  D ELVIRA  'T is surely so  D ISABELLA  We must examine this  And if the Counts be guilty they shall find  Such malice sins beyond a Prince's mercy  BLANCHE  The Counts themselves deserve your admiration  With pains this incredulity they strengthen  And generously attest the whole a cheat  Not Madam that they take this mean low malice  Upon themselves but they declare that one  Of their domestics is the guilty author  Who hoping thus to please them has instructed  This poor mean wretch how to affront brave Carlos  Each with avidity believes this tale  The Counts to gain more credence to their story  Have caus'd this aged man to be imprison'd  D ISABELLA  What must we think of this  BLANCHE  In vain does Carlos  Witness against himself no one believes him  He storms he menaces he raves and wild  With anger loudly claims his Father's liberty  All tremble at his wrath yet disbelieve it  And think he cannot be a Shepherd's Son  But see he comes to make complaint to you  SCENE FOURTH  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE DON CARLOS DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ  D CARLOS  Behold the fruit of my obedience Madam  The fatal secret of my birth is known  Your will expos'd me to this dire mischance  My aged Father from my arms is torn  Falsely accus'd unjustly led to prison  D MANRIQUE  Carlos this Shepherd's claim disgraces you  We think him one suborn'd to stain your honour  He is to prison led for this injustice  D CARLOS  I am this Shepherd's Son He is no cheat  No infamous impostor though mean of blood  He is not vile of soul And I renounce  More willingly the names of Count and Marquis  Than a Son's sentiments of love and duty  Nought can efface the sacred character  Of Nature's ties within an honest breast  I left my parents I disclaim'd my name  My soul for honour sigh'd for glory panted  E'en in that cottage where my fate had cast me  Your courtly maxims warr'd against my hopes  The road of Honour and the course of Glory  Were open but to Lords I had no means  To rise but to conceal my birth I learn'd  To blush at what in other courts would be  My praiseThat in five years a peasant youth  Rose from the Ranks distinguished by his Sword  To be though so contemn'd what now I am    To the Queen    Madam command that they should free my Father  I claim your justice though I stand degraded  That I am known I think disgrace enough  To satisfy the hate of my proud scorners  Let them not vilify my honest Parent  D MANRIQUE    to the Queen    Force this great heart still to preserve his glory  Prevent him from attesting his own tale  We cannot bear that this exalted Carlos  Beneath whose arm the Moors so oft have trembled  To whom this Kingdom so indebted stands  Should from his birth receive a stain indelible  A higher rank his godlike valour merits  Than custom gives to such ignoble blood  I now must own such custom is unwise  Alike impolitic unjust and cruel  The man whose deeds merit a princely rank  Though in a cottage born that rank should grace  D LOPEZ  Most trueBut as that custom is inveterate  We must our conduct shape to the now exigence  In our deceit deign gracious Queen to aid us  The people love their errour they all think  This peasant Shepherd a suborn'd impostor  This errour authorize in spite of Carlos  In justice to his great exploits defend  His Honour and preserve his Rank and Glory  Alvarez strives this Father to persuade  To shew his love by now disowning Carlos  Sustain this artifice our pity rais'd  D CARLOS  How am I fallen If I excite your pity  Retain your scorn resume your enmity  Now my ill fate your envy gratifies  It soothes your pride to pity my disgrace  But ostentatious shew is this your virtue  Which may some ambush haply plan for mine  The glory Heaven has will'd that I should reap  Has made my name deserving of remembrance  My Honours Count would be too dearly purchas'd  If by an act of baseness I retain'd them  Though I conceal'd my birth because 'twas mean  Yet know proud Lords I'll not disown my Father  Nor criminate him e'en to guard my rank  And shield my pride from your contemptuous scorn  D MANRIQUE  Noblest of mindsYield to those rigid maxims  Which custom has establish'd firm as laws  Preserve your honour and disown your birth  D CARLOS  Since known to you I care not Lords who knows it  Who tells the meanness of my birth must tell  That Sancho a poor honest peasant's Son  From bondage sav'd two Counts and lately held  In tribulation two illustrious rivals  On their Queen's choice Sancho a peasant's Son  Holds in his hand the power to seat a Sovereign  Upon that Throne his arm has propp'd his sword  Has twice redeem'dSpite of himself this Sancho  Though but a shepherd's Son was thought a Prince  Hence learn what mind and courage can achieve  And contemplate the building they have rear'd  That want of birth must raze this goodly fabric  Is an unwholesome maxim in the state  Which saps its vigour and enslaves its people  Virtue or in the Peasant or the Prince  Should meet the same impartial just reward  Yet notwithstanding this unjust disgrace  All noble minds will value me the more  When they reflect how much from  nothing  after  High Heaven's example my bold heart has made  D LOPEZ  This generous pride proclaims a nobler birth  It testifies against your own report  And wraps again in mystery's dark veil  What we thought fully clear'd No valiant Carlos  A shepherd's son such sentiments ne'er spoke  Your haughty soul is so sublimely form'd  That I believe the errour we have spread  Rather than your account And I maintain  That you are not the Son of shepherd Nuna  D CARLOS  Allpowerful instinct witnesses I am  Else would my filial love curb pride and shame  Which like a whirlwind rage within my soul  D MANRIQUE  Thou dost mistake thy nobleness of spirit  Which scorns the vice of a mean lowsoul'd pride  For force of blood This fancy'd instinct Carlos▪  By thy own self is all fallacious prov'd  Thou stand'st internal evidence against it    To the Queen    Repent not Madam of those dignities  With which you have rewarded his rare merits  No Monarch could more justly favours place  Virtues like his adorn and heighten honours  And will support them with becoming soul  Superiour e'en to fate which bows before them  D ISABELLA  I know not which my Lords I most admire  His noble nature or your generous minds  Thus rendering honour to illustrious worth    To Carlos    And you miraculous Hero whose great soul  Disdains to take advantage of the errour  Of a whole people who themselves deceive  Say if amidst the griefs which you experience  I can in aught console your mind or mitigate  That destiny your spirit nobly braves  I in detaining have disgrace brought on you  Through my whole life I shall regret your fate  And wish your birth had equall'd your high merit  That I no bounds might set to its reward  D CARLOS  I bow resign'd to what just Heaven ordains  But consolation I can never know  Yet it relieves my fate that you lament it  D ISABELLA  So lowly born I think you most unfortunate  Yet in the most supreme degree I hold you  Estimable that being from such Parents sprung  Unblushing and undaunted thus you own them  Astonish'd I your heart and mind revere  Which in the balance plac'd against your birth  Have far uprais'd your lowly cottage blood  Which mounts ennobled by high Heaven's award  Kings who give titles cannot merit give  Virtue's a gem their power cannot create  They can but set and bid its splendour blaze  When plac'd on high with more conspicuous lustie  Ungrac'd it still retains its native worth  On earth neglected it has Rank in Heaven  Angels proclaiming there its just reward  Aid us O Carlos to preserve your Honours  Concede to custom's strict establish'd laws  Do not proclaim your birth Preserve my favours  D CARLOS  I thank you MadambutI must forego them    D Carlos takes his sword from his belt and kneeling presents it to the Queen    This from your Royal Brother I receiv'd  I now resign it for some worthier hand  D ISABELLA  Oh pain me not to this extreme degree  Carlosretain your swordfor my sake use it  D CARLOS    rising and halfdrawing the sword  With transport Madamfor your sake I'll use it    Going    D ISABELLA  Stay Carlos stayI understand your purpose  'Tis selfdestruction  D ELVIRA  O Carlos let me plead  D LEONORA  Why art thou not my Son For pity's sake  D CARLOS    with assumed composure    What cause for this alarmthese trembling fears  Madam I must retireI to your goodness  My Father's safety earnestly commend  D MANRIQUE  On one condition only grant it Queen    To Carlos    Swear no attempt to make against your life  D ISABELLA  I value much thy lifeOh be entreated  Summon thy Virtue and control despair  Above all praise remain a bright example  Subdue thyself and be the first of Heroes  Carlos I pray theegive me thy word to live    After a pause    Plant not eternal thorns within that heart  Which loves thy virtues and esteems thy valour  Add to the Hero's fame the Saint's submission  And patient bear the present torturing hour  Thy death would darkly cloud my future days  And ev'ry hour embitter with regret  O hapless Carlos promise me to live  D CARLOS  Till my heart breaksHere let the cordage crack  SCENE FIFTH  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE DON CARLOS DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ DON ALVAREZ  D ISABELLA    to Alvarez    Say what successHast thou obtain'd thy suit▪  And will this Peasant quit his claim to Carlos  D ALVAREZ  Nor prayers nor bribe can win this wretched Shepherd  To aid in our design I strove in vain  By every argument to make him feel  How irksome his ungracious presence was  That he disgrac'd a generous valiant Son  Ruin'd his fortune stigmatiz'd his honour  That if he lov'd him he must now declare  'T was a mean trick he had been brib'd to play him  To all the reasons I could urge I added menaces  D CARLOS  My Father's virtue has withstood them all  D ALVAREZ  Unshaken unseduc'dHe claims his Son  And for his loss of fortune or of honour  He says that he can make him a great Lord  Simple and credulous he this believes  Because his wife a hundred times has told him  That at the sight of a poor paltry token  The Queen of Arragon will Carlos aggrandize  I won by the old man's tears and earnest prayers  Present this homely pledge this Iron Casket    Don Alvarez presents an Iron Casket to Donna Leonora who starts at the sight of it and leans for support upon her Daughter    D ISABELLA  What trouble at this sight shakes your whole frame  D LEONORA  Well may my soul be shaken to behold it  That Casket Queen is mine and it contains  The marks by which I am to know my Son  E'en by the King his Father testified  Whether he lives or not this may declare  Enter Guard  GUARD    to Donna Leonora    Madam Don Raymond begs an audience of you  D LEONORA  Swift let him come    Exit Guard      To Isabella    Forgive my impatient ardour  Raymond alone can clear this mystery  SCENE SIXTH  DONNA ISABELLA DONNA LEONORA DONNA ELVIRA BLANCHE DON CARLOS DON MANRIQUE DON LOPEZ DON ALVAREZ DON RAYMOND  D LEONORA  Oh welcome Raymond Hast thou found my Son  D RAYMOND  I hope he lives yet where he is I know not  For from five years of bondage just releas'd  I've vainly sought him where by the late King's order  I with such happy secrecy had plac'd him  His foster Father thought him his own Son  For being absent when a dead child was born  Your living Son was by his wife receiv'd  And with kind care was nurtur'd as her own  A Priest by me intrusted form'd his mind  As 't were through friendly charity and love  And from this pious Pastor have I learn'd  That your Son fled at Sixteen years of age  As he imagin'd bent to follow arms  From which no prayers could win his princely soul  D LEONORA  But whither went he Raymond Can they tell  D RAYMOND  Large sums of gold were oft mysteriously  From him receiv'd but no trace given to find him  Anxious uncertain of his fate five years  Did his false parents mourn When by a neighbour  Just from Castile return'd they were inform'd  That he had seen their son but in such glory  And credit at this Court that his heart fail'd him  He neither dar'd accost him nor declare  That he had known him once a cottage resident  The Sire with joy transported at such news  Set out to seek this boasted Son two days  Before I reach'd his dwelling where I thought  To find Don Sancho safe Hither I bent  My course o'ertook the Deputies from Arragon  And told all this to them In vain I seek  To trace this Peasant or to find your Son  D LEONORA  Look round this presence if amongst these Lords  D RAYMOND    at the feet of

zeal and homage pay your virtues  D CARLOS  Still do I fear some strange reverse of fortune  But let us see if the King's testimony  Agree with what Don Raymond has declar'd  I dare not think such happiness awaits me  D LEONORA    recovering and turning to Carlos    Are you alone incredulous Ope we  This Casket Manrique and Lopez both well know  What it contains    Lopez presents and holds the Casket its contents seen the Queen Leonora takes out a writing    D LEONORA  Raymond whose writing's this  D RAYMOND  Don Sancho's Father's Royal Ferdinand's  D LEONORA  Don Manrique read and force him to believe  D MANRIQUE    reads    To Leonora Queen of Arragon and Wife of Ferdinand  "Fearing to trust maternal tenderness  "Which takes not wisdom's counsel for its guide  "You are deceiv'd by a fictitious tale  "The more securely to deceive the tyrant  "That Son whose death you now in anguish mourn  "I hope will to your bosom be restor'd  "And your now grief be chang'd to rapturous joy  "The wife of Shepherd Nuna tends your child  "She has adopted him his birth unknown  "And with a Mother's tender care will foster him  "She has been told a dark mysterious tale  "And on her secrecy promis'd reward  "If when the Child has number'd twenty years  "She with this Iron Casket send him forth  "To seek for Leonora Queen of Arragon  "Who knows the sacred treasure it contains  "And can alone unlock the secret spring  "And who will make this her adopted Child  "A powerful Lord who kindly will maintain her  "In peace and plenty in her hoary age  "If faithfully from him and all the world  "She keep the secret till the appointed time  "Deign Leonora when this meets your eye  "Howe'er high Heaven has of my fate dispos'd  "To own in Nuna's Son who this presents  "Your Son and mine my rightful lineal Heir  "Hail him as lawful King of Arragon  "And may he worthy prove to wear my crown  "Or never mount his wretched Father's Throne  "Ferdinand King of Arragon"  D LEONORA    to Carlos who kneels to her    Thy mind thy courage all attest my Son  O teach me to deserve this blessing Heaven  This more than all a Mother's hopes could ask  This ecstasy of joy too great for words  O bless my Son and guard his virtues still    She raises Carlos    D CARLOS  No longer can I doubt my birthMy Sister    Embraces D Elvira      To D Isabella    Thus grac'd and thus distinguish'd still I sigh  As incomplete my bliss if you forbid  My hopes  D ISABELLA  He is to hope superiour Prince  Who can command his wish The power to name  A Monarch for Castile I with my Ring  Bestow'd I begg'd you to remain to give  That pledge into Don Sancho's hand too much  I him esteem e'er to revoke that prayer  D CARLOS  I thank you Madam with a grateful heart  I feel the bliss of this ecstatic moment  My heart pent up and bursting through despair  Heaven has reliev'd by an unheardof grace  No more I wonder at my high ambition  My Queen and Sister shar'd my hopeless heart  The voice of love and nature undistinguish'd  D ELVIRA  My Heart respecting still my rank repaid  That love which kindred blood inspires and owes  D CARLOS  If as a Brother then you love and honour me  You will accept a husband from my hand  D ELVIRA  If on Alvarez Prince your choice is fix'd  To all men I preferr'd him save yourself  D CARLOS    to D Leonora    This fair alliance has your sanction Madam    D Leonora bows assent      To Alvarez presenting D Elvira    Accept the brightest gem I can bestow  My darling Sister for your bride Alvarez    To Manrique and Lopez    And you my Lords though you disdain'd my birth  Yet when these doubts arose judged in my favour  With such generous warmth by that have shown  That your disdain from honour sprang not pride  Your maxims wrong but virtuous your intent  Accept my friendship and receive my thanks  D RAYMOND    to Isabella    Permit the Arragonians to behold him  Our Deputies impatient wait for Audience  And burn with eagerness to see their King  D ISABELLA    to Leonora    Let us in public give them audience Madam  That All may hear this miracle explain'd  But let the honest Shepherd share the joy  His coming with that Casket makes complete    To D Carlos and D Leonora    The trials of your hearts now end in transport  That virtue which our Duties all enjoin  Though strongly tried still meets its sure reward  A peaceful Conscience and approving Heaven

Act First  SCENE FIRSTA GARDEN  ADELINDA    Coming from behind an Alcove and looking about as she comes forward    Adelinda  OH plague take it Flora is coming this way Well I have had the good luck of a clear coast once to day and so now I must compound for a little vexation and disappointment    To Flora as she enters    What is in the wind now What do you want  SCENE SECOND  ADELINDA FLORA  Flora  Mademoiselle Adelinda I have been looking for you all over the house and gardens this long while  Adelinda  Well then longlookedfor is found at last  Flora  Lord Mademoiselle what can you be always in this garden for  Adelinda  ForFresh air and the dear comfort of being alone and in peace and quiet  Flora  You were not formerly so fond of the garden nor so desirous of being alone What amusement can you find here by yourself  Adelinda  AmusementI dance Rigadoons and study the Stars  Flora  Study the Stars at high noon day  Adelinda  Oh yes I can read enough in them now to tell you your fortune  Flora  I did not know that amongst your other very rare qualifications that fortunetelling was to be reckoned  Adelinda  Oh I will give you an instant proof of thatShew me your hand    She snatches Flora's hand    you are in love with a man who is much younger than yourselfhe has slighted all your advancesbut you have still hopes  Flora    aside    How came this into the little serpent's head  Adelinda  Keep your eyes fixed upon mine FloraLet me seewhat your face saysWhy you are a great mischief makera plottervery curiousmaliciousandas I am alive given to thieving  Flora    in a passion    And you Mademoiselle are  given to be vulgar and rude to every body You are born to disgrace your birth and high rank and your noble parents And I tell you without the help of the stars that it will be your fortune to be sent back once more to your Conventand for life too this timeFor I heard my Lord swear by St Dennis that you should be a Nun So Mademoiselle unless you mend your manners and alter you conduct your fate will be to wear the Veileat Soup meager sleep in a Dormitory and do Pennance for the remainder of your days  Adelinda  Bravo FloraA word in your ear    Speaking close to her but in a very loud voice    The next time my Mother lectures me you shall be turn'd out neck and heelsYou are by nature sufficiently impertinent without the aid of any of the Marchioness's eloquence Besides you select only the dregs of it and you deliver her sermons with as ill a grace as you wear her castoff gowns  Flora  'T is not what the Marchioness alone says that I repeatevery body speaks thus of you and unless  Adelinda  You can grow young again this pretty Youth on whom you have set your heart will leave you to hang yourself upon yon willow  Flora  sullenly  My Lady has waited in her dressingroom this hour for youshe sent me to look for you  Adelinda  Very well Go you and tell my Mother that I am coming  Flora  I wait to attend you to her  Adelinda  But I do not chuse your attendance so march without me  Flora  No Mademoiselle I shall wait your leisure here    Adelinda goes searching among the shrubs and comes back to Flora    Adelinda  And so you will not go without me  Flora  No Mademoiselle I promise you that I shall not move from this spot but to follow you  Adelinda  Well then Flora I find that I must make you my confident  Flora  Ah Mademoiselle I suspected that you had other amusements in this garden besides stargazing and dancing Rigadoons 'T is well you are willing to tell me for I was bent upon finding out why you are grown so astonishingly fond of solitude  Adelinda  I have had a hundred times a mind to trust you Flora for I have been in constant fear of your great penetrationWhy you must know then that through great charity I keep a whole family hereFatherMotherChildren and I come every morning noon and night to feed them  Flora  Lord Mademoiselle How do these beggars get into the Garden to be fed by you  Adelinda  They live here constantly and this is their eldest Child See    opening her hand    what a fine large black Spider it is  Flora  screaming    O pray MademoiselleOh dear Oh dear  Adelinda  Now decamp without me or I'll fetch the whole family  Flora  If you do I shall faintor go into fits  Adelinda  Faint ha ha ha  Flora  Indeed Mademoiselle I shall faint unless you throw it away  Adelinda  Then I shall be obliged to let it crawl upon your face till you have done fainting for I have no sal volatile nor eau de luce to recover you So faint or go whichsoever you please instantly  Flora  going    A perverse little devilWhat mischief is in her wild head now I wonder  SCENE THIRD  ADELINDA alone    Adelinda  So I am rid of this Argus    looking about    But here comes my MotherWell out of the frying pan into the fireHeigh hoI must endure it I cannot frighten her away  SCENE FOURTH  THE MARCHIONESS ADELINDA  Marchioness  Why Adelinda when I sent last night to entreat you to spend this morning in my  dressingroom would you not oblige meYou may one day perhaps experience the pang which a mother feels when she begs in vain for a proof of kindness and common civility from her Child  Adelinda  Lord Madam I thought my father would be there and I was so wearied out last night with hearing of my ungrateful rebellious conduct of my incorrigible vulgarity of my want of taste and judgment and of what a disgrace I am to his name and blood that I was truly glad to escape from his passionate exclamations which gall and irritate me so that I am forced to say things which he does not like  Marchioness  Adelinda you must take care how you provoke your Father you made him so very angry last night that I trembled for you  Adelinda  Yes there was reason to tremble I expect that he will give me a good beating in one of his passions for sure never was mortal in such a rage as he was in with me last night It is very unfortunate for me that I have either eyes understanding or the use of speech since I can neither look think nor speak without putting my father into a most horrible pucker  Marchioness  It was impossible to forbear from being angry with you last night I assure you that I should have joined in resenting your behaviour but your father's severe determination after he had commanded you from his presence terrified me to death and I forgot my own displeasure against you in my  sorrow at the punishment which your father swore to inflict upon you and but for my interposition he would this day have sent you back to your Convent  Adelinda  What to make a Nun of me  Marchioness  I fear so  Adelinda  Merciful stars I did not think that he had been in such a wicked passion as that came to neitherAnd all for my telling him an unwelcome truth I fear and esteem my father but he has never taught me to love him He is justice herself he holds the scales with a steady hand and wields the sword with unrelenting rigourexcept when he is himself the culprit But thanks to you Madam for interposing so that he has broken the Oath 't was rashly made and not fit to be kept but in his next passion he will again swear and as easily break the vow  Marchioness  I hope for your own sake that you will not make the experiment for however willing I may be to sue for your peace I may lose my influence for your Mother Adelinda could not last night obtain your pardon till she knelt for it at your father's feet  Adelinda  O my dear Mother what do I not owe to your patience and your goodnessBut 't is all all in vain for I was born to disgrace and grieve you Yet do not hatedo not curse me  Marchioness  Horrid thoughtno more of this we will not awaken humiliating sensationsLet the future redeem the pastI have promis'd for  you that you will change your conduct That you will behave with more duty and attention to your Father and that you will treat your Cousin more properly  Adelinda  Oh that Cousin of mine is as plagueful as a Ghost in a haunted house I am never at quiet for him I am always engaged either in a quarrel with himself or with my father about him I wish that the Chaplain would exorcise him for an evil spirit and confine him to the bottom of the Red Sea for nine hundred and ninetynine years I am sure that I would never light the end of candle that should release him  Marchioness  I am astonished that neither his birth his rank nor his accomplishments procure him respect or even common civility from you and yet you are much indebted to his generous disinterestednessYour Father has offered if you will not change your conduct to settle his whole fortune upon him but he most nobly rejected it declaring that he would never enjoy what he considered as your birthright unless you shared it with him He laments yet always lessens your imperfectionsAnd he avers that notwithstanding your foibles that both in heart and mind you are capable of great things  Adelinda  He sticks to his text I find for he always begins his sermons by telling me what fine things I could do if I would but give my soul elbow room Yet I suspect he treats me with the oil of fool alias flattery only for the ostentation of displaying  his own sagacity whilst I question his seeing further into a millstone than other people  Marchioness  Adelinda be serious and give me your attentionIf your father's intentions be not altered by his last night's anger you will you know be very shortly your Cousin's Wife even within a few days Therefore my dear Child this is the crisis of your fate and I am trembling for your future happiness with all the anxiety of a Mother who sees the rock upon which your heedless youth will drive to its assured destruction  Adelinda  Alas Madam I cannot new make myself either to shew my gratitude to you or my obedience to my Lordly Father He might as well quarrel with his pack of hounds because they have not flowing manes like his coachhorses as with me for not being a fine ladyAnd when all is said and done for my share I do not perceive what there is so outrageously amiss in me to make all this constant havock about  Marchioness  That you have good qualities every body allowsBut your bluntness your rudeness of speech your intractable temper your churlish manners your inflexible obstinate humour disgrace the nobleness of your birth and disgust every one who lives or converses with you And indeed unless you correct your untoward disposition you cannot expect to live on comfortable and pleasant terms with the Count when the lover will be lost in the husband And would you not wish to be considered as your  husband's first friend and favourite companion Could you like to live neglected despised forgotten  Adelinda  No faith I do not say that neither  Marchioness  Then for your own sake determine to polish your manners and soften the ruggedness of your temper  Adelinda  There is so much wanting to be done Madam to make me what you with that I shall never have the heart even to begin I might toil up a high hill but alas I am quite hopeless of walking up the outside of a church steepleindeed Madam my reformation is a moral impossibility and you always paint me so much of a Blackamoor that I am sure 't is labour in vain to attempt to wash me white  Marchioness  No my dear Child it is not if you would but once resolve to constrain your tempermake the effort at leastReflect seriously upon the consequence of your first steps in life they will stamp your character with the world and have you no wish to be admired  Adelinda  Oh no there is more cost than worship in itto gain your sort of admiration I must be constantly in the pilloryand for whatwhy only the  hopes  of a mouthful of moonshine  Marchioness  But surely you would at least wish to be esteemed  Adelinda  Esteemed yes I cannot live in any comfort without that esteem is requisite to be sure 't is like the air one breathes a want but not a pleasure  Marchioness  But Adelinda even esteem is very reluctantly paid if not refused to those whose strange humour and rude offensive familiarity disgust and affront every body And if you will persist in retaining your churlishness and inattention how will you appear in polished society  Adelinda  O Lord Madam like a carp out of water The society which delights you is not my element and I shall never be any thing in it but a queer fish gaping and floundering about For the fine folks and fine manners of your polished societies are my hatred and utter aversion their maxims would suffocate every natural feeling of my heart and annihilate every useful property of my understanding for I must love and hate by a factitious rule and measure and judge and give my voice by weights which I know to be false the fastidious drams and scruples illegally stamped as standard by the usurped authority of folly falshood affectation and nonsense  Marchioness  What a sarcastic ungovernable spirit We have lost our two Sons and you the only Child whom Providence has spared to us are determind to be the constant source of disquiet and affliction to our mindsO Adelinda you have blasted all my comfortlong very long have I looked forward to your present age of reason and anticipated the treasure that I hoped to find in your tender affection as a Child and your sympathy as a friend But all these flattering dreams vanish You  have filled my heart with grief and bitter disappointment for the present and I look forward to the future with that fearful agony which makes even the very thoughts of life painful to me    Turns weeping from Adelinda    Adelinda  falling at the Marchioness's feet    O my Mother  Marchioness    leaning over her    Can you then feel for me O rouse all your affection all your reason all your duty Can you not resolve my dear Child will you not promise    raising her    Adelinda    with great agitation    I can at this moment resolve if you speak the wordto dieBut O my dear MotherI cannotindeedI cannot promise what you wish  Marchioness  Alas Adelinda can you thus partake the anguish of my soul and have the power yet want the will to give me peace  Adelinda  I cannot speak the agonizing grief that tears my heartto think what sorrow I give to yours I disdain a falsehoodI cannot promisebecause I know too certainly know the fatal impossibility of keeping my word Cease to love me Mother I am unworthy your affection Alas I know I am  Marchioness  Yonder your father comes the Count is with him Dear Adelinda    takes her hand  at least in your father's presence for my sake constrain your temper Do not speak if you cannot speak respectfully I have passed my word that you will alter your conduct else your father will break off this  treaty of marriage and send you back to a Cloister for life Think of what I suffered last night for your sake and let not such deep humiliation have been in vain You are silent my Child I will yet hope what you dare not promise  SCENE FIFTH  THE MARQUIS THE MARCHIONESS THE COUNT ADELINDA  Marquis  Did the distance deceive me or did I see Adelinda on her knees  Adelinda  You did my Lord  Marquis  Why what thunderbolt was strong enough to bow your stubborn pride  Adelinda  My Lord when gentle Angels warn us of impending dangers there needs no thunderbolt to bow the stubborn will Their kindness melts the heart trembling we own their mercy and kneel with gratitude and humbleness to thank that goodness which we cannot merit  Count  My charming Cousin    takes her hand which she withdraws    Marquis  How came you Adelinda to say so gracious and so proper a thing Why are you not always thus  Adelinda  Because my Lord I am not like an  Italian Greyhound fawning without friendship and licking the hand of every stranger as cordially as that of his Master I prefer the disposition of the honest English Mastiff who is submissive only to the kind master whom he loves and who will fight till he dies for those to whom he is attached  Marquis  I presume Madam that you have told Adelinda what you have promised for herand that it was only at your intreaty that I have forgiven her behaviour to me last night  Marchioness  I have my Lord and Adelinda will I hope fulfil the promise which I have ventured to make for her and by becoming as amiable and as complacent in her manners as you can wish she will not only rejoice my anxious heart but reward all my care  Adelinda    aside    Impossible  Marquis  This day then my dear Count we will sign the Settlements and tomorrow shall be the day of the celebration of your Nuptials  Adelinda  Tomorrow my Lord No no no notnot tomorrow for Heaven's sake  Count  Shall it be Thursday Adelinda  Adelinda  Oh no no  Count  Let it be Saturday then  Adelinda  No I beg not  Marquis  Adelinda there is no obliging youI will name the day Tomorrow you give your hand to the Count    aside to Adelinda    or you return to your Convent for life whichsoever you please  Marchioness  My dear Lord  Marquis  Madam I will not recedetherefore do not request what I must have the pain of refusing even to you    taking Adelinda's and the Count's hand    Daughter I give your hand to this young Lord but for him my ancient name would be extinct I am proud that he is my relation and my friend And he is most deservedly the Son of my choice As you value my blessing Adelinda I exhort you to merit his affection and preserve his esteem    Joins their hands the Count kisses that of Adelinda    Count  Most gratefully I thank you my Lord for the honour which you confer upon me and the sacred trust which you repose in me I will aspire to maintain in all its lustre that name which has been for so many ages renowned and the happiness of your lovely Daughter shall be the constant object of my tenderest attention    The Count attempts to raise Adelinda's hand to his lipsshe disappoints him be snatching it back    Marquis  I resign her with full confidence to your care Count avoid my errours Adelinda let your altered conduct oblige me to forget the past Imitate your Mother's exalted merit or become an alien to your father's love    Exit Marquis    SCENE SIXTH  THE MARCHIONESS THE COUNT ADELINDA  Marchioness  My dear Count though to call you Son is the first wish of my heart yet this is a trying moment which only a Mother like me can feel Remember my dear Adelinda that your own happiness and the felicity of your parents depend upon your conduct    taking Adelinda's hand    Heaven bless you my dear Girl and may no child of yours ever make you know the anxious care which at this moment rends my heart    Adelinda kisses her hand      Exit Marchioness    SCENE SEVENTH  THE COUNT ADELINDA    Who stands looking after the Marchioness and drying her eyes    Count    taking her hand    My fair Adelinda are my wishes indeed accomplished Your heart sympathizes with your Mother's feelings Is it then subdued are you changed  Adelinda    recovering her spirits and withdrawing her hand    O Lord yes changed yes  Count  But seriously  Adelinda  In downright earnest to be sure  smiling  Count  I know that you are sincereTherefore tell meare you now serious  Adelinda  Oh I am much too sincere at times and so as to displease you most mightily  Count  'T is true For often your sincerity arises from the peculiarly uncouth ruggedness of your temper rather than from a scrupulous love of truth Your sincerity is the squib of peevish petulance and and not the conscientious award of just judgment  Adelinda  What a pointed precise witty waspish wiredrawn distinction you have made and your domineering decision amblingly alliterates as agreeably as the clinking cadence of the Church Clock's chimes  Count  It is but too just a decisionhowever let it pass my fair Cousinat this most awful period of our lives let us rather resolve against all future disputes than now enter upon new ones You are my destined Bride    he offers to take her hand she puts it behind her    Adelinda  Yesso it  seems    Count  Seems  why are you not what do you think of it  Adelinda  What do I think of itNothing at all  Count  A clear explication truly  Adelinda  Rightly observed Cousin 'T is a most  accurate admirable excellent explication indeed For when despotic authority says "Daughter you  shall  marry that man"and that very man says "Mademoiselle you are destined to make my fortune and  therefore  I reject you not"The girl has  nothing  to think about for she is precluded from the privilege of thinking to any purposeand I assure you that I think  nothing  about marrying you my Lord  Count  Still haughty still intractable  Adelinda    laughing    Hola Cousin have a care that your sincerity be not the squib of peevish petulanceIt was but this moment that you resolved against all disputes and you begin already So to war we go jangling like hammer and tongs as usual  Count    laughing    That phrase is superlatively elegant  Adelinda  pettishly    Then if you don't like it mend it  Count  How ill does that rustic speech and manner agree with eyes that seem to sparkle with intelligence as well as beauty Your countenance and disposition are by no means assorted they correspond so little together that they would disappoint and disgust good company  Adelinda  sarcastically    Good Company What is Good Company  Count  Ridiculous question Do you not know what Good Company is  Adelinda  No Nor you neither Cousin by your  not answering my question But I suppose that your Good Company like the Monster that I saw the other Day is a nondescript and so are your People of fashion and polite Circles and the great World with all the immense farrago of fashionable phrases that pretend to class folks into tribes which I hold to be as nondescript as my Monster from the Moon Mountains in Africa  Count  You mistake fair Lady Good Company is as easily defined as wit sense taste or judgment Good Company Adelinda is the select part of People of Rank and Education of People of great talents and amiable manners who having from superior understandings a stronger claim to distinction and respect than the generality of the World possess seek out each other and being assimilated by the attractive chain of real merit enter into friendship assort together and form that elect part of society which I distinguish by the name of Good Company  Adelinda  And do you make one in Good Company  Count  I have that flattering distinction  Adelinda  Well if you be Good Company then is Good Company the most wearisome thing upon the face of God Almighty's Earth  yawns and rubs her eyes    Have you any Snuff my Lord for  your  good Company has vapoured me to death  Count    bowing    I expected not so very enchanting a compliment  Adelinda  I have told you a hundred times that  it is the way of me to speak what I think if it offend you you can revenge yourself the catalogue of my manifold imperfections is so very extensive that you can find more ample faults of mine to descant upon than I have picked out of yours of your being tiresome teasing and thwartingI do not beg for quarter  Count  Indeed you do not deserve it but your sacred sex protects you I am bound to respect it even though you set at defiance good breeding politeness and even the common regards of decent civility  Adelinda  And where is the real merit of your good breeding your politeness and your regards flummery and nonsense you flatter because you want to be flattered in return Flattery I suppose is the current coin which buys a place in Good CompanyLet people speak as they think and  seem  only what they are just as God made them and Nature formed them As for me I cannot stem the impulse of my disposition it carries me away the current is too strong for my resistance  Count  But you should endeavour to exterminate so ungracious a disposition  Adelinda  Yes and make myself just as artificial and ridiculous a figure as the Yew trees in the Kitchen Garden tortured into every possible form that can make them appear outlandish and disagreeable  Count    to himself    What an unbending mind what a stubborn spirit What hope is there of softening it  Adelinda  He is dreaming with his eyes open and talking Gibberish in his sleepI'll escape  going    Count  Adelinda stayI was lost in thought Can I by any entreaty win you to render your humour complacent Beautiful Adelinda you might if you pleased inspire me with the most ardent passion for you Your heart I am sure is good though so rugged and discourteous to all around you And though I lament its constant misapplication yet I cannot help admiring the strong powers of your understanding Why then will you call forth dislike where you might excite love Why brave censure when you might create esteem Make but a just use of the invaluable gifts with which nature has endowed you and you will enslave my very soul  Adelinda  softened  Cousin you plead so well that methinks I am half sorry that 't is impossible for you to gain your suit  Count  Say not so Adelinda Reflect that in a few hours you will be my Wife consider that the happiness of my future life is in your hands and if you cannot gain a proper ascendancy over your disposition that I am doomed to be miserable and every moment of my existence I shall have to blush with shame and grief at my Wife's misconduct  Adelinda    haughtily    No my Lord I will save you from so sad a fate from this alldreaded shame never I promise you shall my Husband have to blush at my misconduct  Count  How you delight me by this promise then my amiable Adelinda you will correct your failings and kindly condescend to be guided by the tender advice of the man who wishes to adore you  Adelinda  I most devoutly make you a second promiseand I call Heaven to witness the sincerity of my intentionsThat in no one circumstance of my future life shall the advice of you my Cousin the Count D'Olstainever govern me  Count  NoYou speak riddles You promise that I shall never have to blush at your misconduct and yet you threateningly promise defiance against me either as your friend or counsellorFor Heaven's sake condescend to explain this mystery  Adelinda  No I shall give no explanation I intend to surprise every body  Count  How can you take a pride in torturing me You suffer your strange temper to drown every benevolent feeling of your heart Have you no kindness for others no sympathy for their distress Why should you rejoice in creating misery when you might  Adelinda  Stop stop for the love of charity do not stun my ears with any more of your tedious preachmentsKnow my Lord that such as my manners and disposition are such I would have them to be and such they shall remain if I were to live to the age of MethuselahTherefore if you can work no surer miracle than my reformation you will never be canonized for a SaintBut to shew you  that I can occasionally do a civil and polite thing I rid you of my vulgarity and leave you to the full enjoyment of your own Good Company    Exit Adelinda    SCENE EIGHTH  THE COUNT alone  Count  What a strange what a perverse Girl If I marry her I sacrifice all my future happinessIf I reject her the Marquis will oblige her to take the Veil and make me the unjust possessor of her birthright    Exit Count    End of the First Act  Act Second  SCENE FIRSTA SALOON  STRASBOURG FLORA entering to him  Flora  YOUR Servant Monsieur Strasbourg  Strasbourg  Down to the ground yours Madam Flora  Flora    aside    Charming fellow how handsome he is What a fine figure What an elegant air I'll plague him a little howeverWhy Strasbourg for a Steward how magnificently you dressBut you are rich your father had the management of the old Marquis's fortune and of his Son's for forty years You are his heir and still StewardAnd a most pompous fine gentleman to be sure you are but they say you can afford it yet if I were my Lord  Strasbourg  You would not keep a Steward who looked so much like yourself Ha my smart Abigail but I must decline the felicity of your company just now for my Lord is coming hither upon business so permit me to hand you out of the saloon  Flora  Well Monsieur I am here upon my Lady's business I came here to look for Mademoiselle Adelinda  Strasbourg  Then as she is not here by all means pursue your business  Flora  Suppose Strasbourg that to keep your dress in proper countenance you were to embroider your manners with a slight border of politeness  Strasbourg  Child if I did you would mistake my meaning I think you most enchantingly agreeable and you treat me in a manner that flatters me most delightfully and if it were not for the extraordinary esteem and respect that I have for your Lady I should encourage your predilection  Flora  What do you mean what do you insinuate  Strasbourg  Only divine perfection of a woman that your Lady would take it very ill at my hands if I seduced her favourite Abigail from that path of discretion which her years exact that she should tread in and the practice of that virtue which she is said hitherto to have most religiously observed  Flora  Impudent Coxcomb audacious Slanderer goodfornothing Storyteller  SCENE SECOND  THE MARQUIS STRASBOURG FLORA  Marquis  Thank your stars Strasbourg for my timely appearanceWhy I believe that Flora was going to beat you  Flora    crying    No no I was not but but I wish to Heaven that somebody would give him a good caning for me  Marquis  Why Strasbourg what unpardonable offence have you committed to deserve such treatment from Flora  Strasbourg  I only said my Lord that the Marchioness would be displeased with me if I seduced Flora's virtue and behold for this she calls me a slanderer and a storyteller  Flora  No it was not for that but for supposing supposingindeed my Lord I do not deserve deservebut I wish that you would not keep such a fop of a StewardThere is no being happy in the house for himhe is so grand and so proudand he saysand he saysthat that he looks like your Lordship  Marquis    gaily    Why truly Strasbourg so I think you doyou are more sumptuous to day than usual I think I really must follow Flora's advice and dismiss youfor you always appear so splendid that indeed there is some hazard of your being mistaken for me  Strasbourg  In Christian charity my Lord you are bound not to dismiss me for no other Nobleman in all Europe can afford to retain me in his service  Marquis  How so Strasbourg  Strasbourg  Because your Lordship is the only one possessed of such princely manners as to afford without any danger of mistakes or derogation from  your own dignity and consequence to keep a Steward who has the vanity to aspire in his dress and and deportment to look like a gentleman    bowing respectfully    Marquis    laughing    Now Flora if Strasbourg will pay you as curious a compliment I am sure that you must forgive him  Strasbourg  Pray my Lord do not intercede for me for a quarrel with Flora is the delight of my soul her arguments are so terse her wit so elegantly polished and her elocution so flowing and so correct that to be the object of her anger is the most heavenly amusement that I have any idea of So no pardon no quarter sweet Flora  Flora  Hang the fellow he always has the art to have every one of his side always he knows how to flatter himself into people's liking and out of their hatred    Exit Flora    SCENE THIRD  THE MARQUIS STRASBOURG  Marquis  Poor FloraWell Strasbourg what is the business  Strasbourg  My Lord the Widow of your late tenant Orland sends me word that she is coming this morning with her rent and to beg that your Lordship  will be pleased to renew the lease of the Olstain Farm to her I suppose that you have no objection to renewing the lease but at what rent my Lord all your other tenants have had their rents raised but Dorcas tells me that she hopes as she nursed my Young Lady that you will favour her  Marquis  Yes on that consideration and as she is a Widow I will renew the lease for the term of her life at the same rentI suppose the report of Adelinda's marriage brought her hither just at this time that she might be present at the wedding Has she brought her pretty Daughter with her  Strasbourg  I do not know my Lord'tis not certainperhaps soI believe she hasI I rather think she maybut I cannot be positive  Marquis  I begin to think Strasbourg that you are in love with that girl you are always so embarrassed so shy and look so very silly whenever I question you about your visits to that part of the Country Your confused mysterious answers have made me suspect that some love affair was your business at Olstain and not the barnbuilding or seeing after the workmenI want to see this girl this Zella I have heard so much of her beautyBut are you seriously in love with her Strasbourg  Strasbourg  My Lord Zella to be sure is a sweet pretty creature a sweet pretty creature indeed my Lord to be sure So genteel so delicate so blooming one must be a statue not to be struck with her Every body is in love with her But she rejects  every body and wants her mother to let her be a Nun but it is pity that she should as Dorcas can give her a good deal of money whenever she marries  Marquis  Are your high notions then so far humbled as to marry a farmer's daughter What is become of your taste and your pride But do you really intend to make her your Wife  Strasbourg  Yeyeyeyes and please your LoLordship  Marquis  Ha ha ha you may well hesitate Stasbourgyou who used to pique yourself upon your consequence and your pretensionsA Brother in the Churcha good fortune of your ownmuch respected in your Lord's familymuch honoured by his kindnessall this I have heard from you and are you indeed going to make love to a Dairymaid  Strasbourg  Truly my Lord I blush at demeaning myself so muchBut my Lord let love plead my excuse irresistible love which I have been unable to conquer in spite of every the most powerful reasons for overcoming itI love so fervently that I would rather die than not win the Woman whom I adore    With much emotion    Believe me my honoured Lord that the idea of offending you afflicts me much though even that fear has not been able to subdue my passion  Marquis  You speak as one deeply smitten indeed Strasbourg But one thing it behoves me to tell you Zella being the daughter of my tenant  and very young as she has lost her Father whom I very much respected I think her intitled to my protection therefore know certainly your own mind about this girl before you lay siege to her heart Your pride may step in now but I tell you that it shall not afterwards You have had several attachments so I suspect your constancy in this and I will allow of no foolery in this affair you have my consent to court her for your wife but not to dangle after her for your amusement and then leave her to wear the willow  Strasbourg  No to be sure my Lord your Lordship is very right very good  Marquis  I own that I did not suppose that the Daughter of Dorcas would have been your choice I imagined from your spirit and taste that you would have chosen a fine dashing wife whom all my tenants would have looked upon as fine lady enough to be the wife of a Lord  Strasbourg  You think my heart lowly But alas my Lord I fear that it is only too high and too ambitious  SCENE FOURTH  THE MARQUIS STRASBOURG SERVANT  Marquis  Whom do you seek  Servant  My Lord I came to tell Monsieur Strasbourg  that Dorcas the widow farmer from Olstain asks for him  Marquis  Is she come alone  Servant  No my Lord there is the handsomest young Woman with her that I ever set my eyes upon  Marquis  Shew them into this room    Exit Servant    Now Strasbourg I shall see your taste for beauty  Servant enters again  Servant  Walk this way if you please    Exit Servant    Strasbourg    aside    What does he want with them Has he a mind for the girl himself 'T is like enough  SCENE FIFTH  THE MARQUIS STRASBOURG DORCAS ZELLA    Dorcas

Convent for tan whole yares wanter and Sommur and now I think an intands to maake a  Laady on her unless she's undutiful and wo'n't be advised for her good  Marquis  With such a person she may well pretend to be a Lady she will be admired wherever she goes  Dorcas  Ah yah that's what jantelmen all bedizened with shilver and gewld an like your Lordship who saw bar at the grate at the Nun's Convent used to say But that war northing to wonder and marval at for she war a deal siner clod there for I ollost caparisoned har like a yong Laady and I gon har the bast of larnein that I could have for money and har father navvar cared how much was spant upon har and she ollost took to it kindly an as te war naturably as thof she war born to be a Schollard she larnt to dance and to sing and all sorts of good gear of larnein with hard names I ca'n't spake that I could have for my money Oh she's as larned as any laady o'the Land and so our Parson says  Marquis  Well Dorcas and I hope she is a good girl and that you have no reason to repent the expense  Dorcas  Oh no not I not an thof it had been a tan times as much she had avvery body's goode worde jantle and sempleShe wanted to stay in har nunnery all har life but a noa says I and har father she sha'n't a had all that money bestow'd upon har pracious larncin to barry it nartherSo the short and the long out was as I wanted har to keep me company I fached har home last Childermas day twelvemonth  Alack and a well a day I was gone for she whan yar Coach and Six stopped at my house with my poor Yong Laady Adelinda in it that yow war so cruel as to sand back to har Convent for a whole long yare against har willshe cried and took on sorely at my houseand I was mainly sorry at yar barbarousness in sanding har back  Marquis  Why Dorcas I sent her back for improvementand by what I perceive I sent back an obstinate ungracious awkward unpolite girl the same day that you fetched home an amiable elegant Young Woman  Dorcas  O yas Zalla is as alagant as any laady thof she is so plane drassedbut a when she camed home she would not go fineshe fade that te did not become har lowly stachion to be so drassed and my silly husband that's dade and gon he was of har side  Marquis  Ah Dorcas you are a widow now  Dorcas  Yas thank God and plase yar Lordship to my grate joy  Marquis  Thank God Why Orland made you a very good husband  Dorcas  Yas only we was ollost a quarrelling he was so surly so brutal so obstinate and so sulky and plase your Lordship that he is bast to my liking where he is  Marquis  I have formerly often heard him complain of you Dorcas He used to say that you were crossgrained crabbed stubborn passionate for ever contradicting him and woefully disobedient  Dorcas  Oh yas an like your Lordship I scorned all thority I navvar gon way and if I could not get my own mind I ollost got the last ward that's what I ollost would havethan when he had no more to say I got banged a bit but I ollest made my part good blow for blow and war'n't I in the right ont plase yar Lordship    curtsying    Marquis  Oh as a woman of spirit very right to be sure    laughing    Dorcas  I'd have aten the flash off my own bones sooner than not have bin as masterly as he but for all his blows I could make him afeerd of me  Marquis  Why zounds Dorcas you could not thrash him could you  Dorcas  No an plase you no I could sooner thrash your worship's Lordshipno no at fair blows he was twice my match 't was not so why yow must know that we had a great davvil of a rumpus just arter I fached this here cratur home and he was woundily purvoking and contradicted me a little too much for my likingso I farly swore that if I had not my own way I'de drown'd myself and have him hanged for muddering meHe was fule enough to dar me to it so egad my lord I was in such a raging passion that I raanned right oute of the house and he arter me cross the Orchard cross the Homestall into the parkpiece and jumps me out of brathe as I was before his face right plump into the pond where the grate carp areHe got me out but I did not spake for a whole day I was so drowndedand so my Lord▪  whanaver I talked of the pond arter that I was ollost sure of having my own wayand so 't was that I made him afeerd of me  Marquis  And does Zella promise to have as good a spirit she does not look as if she had  Dorcas  She a good spurritI am glad yow have thought of that Why Lord she is the poorest lamblikest thing that avvar God made Spurrit indeed she'll navvar stand up for har own rights as long as she brathesshe is so tame and so frightful that she is for all the world like a naturable fule whan she first camed home I taked har for a downright fuleborn hideot she had not the sanse to sa boh to a goose with all har dancing and larneinAnd she would blush O good lords I could navvar open my mouth to spake but she would blush and then fall a whimpering whether I spaked snappish to har or no And yat for all that she do n't want sanse in har way when she is in the yowmour to talk a bit but that 's not often  Marquis  My Steward tells me that he wishes to marry her  Dorcas  Yas an like your Lordship so he told me whan I axt him pretty roundly what brought him so often to our side of the country for I was shrewd enough to pick out that the barnbuilding was not all the businessand if yow give him yar good word and are agreeable to it why he shall have her  Zella    weeping    Dear Mother I beseech you consider  Marquis  But how is this Dorcas Zella is in tears how does her heart stand inclined to the match Does not she prefer somebody else  Dorcas  Pray now axt har yarself for I wish I may die if I can find out what she likes thof 't is no matters for I intands that she shall have Mounsheer Strawsbourg because I like him and think him the finest jantleman I avvar saw save and axcept your Lordship's father But whenever I talks of Mounseer Strawsbourg she ollost holds down har hade and cries just as she does now that's har way so do yow see what yow can make her say  Marquis  Zella my fair damsel Strasbourg is a good sort of young man and I hope that he will make you a kind husband I think it a very advantageous nay even a great match for youhave you any regard for Strasbourg Do you think you can love him    A pause Zella weeping    Dorcas  There I told ye that's har waycry cry cryand hold down her hade that's har way to the life  Marquis  Speak ZellaSpeak without fear and tell your real sentimentsCan you like Strasbourg Speak your mind sincerely  Zella  Alas my Lord NoIndeed I can never like himnever never  Marquis    laughing    This is a plain answer Dorcashere is nothing to find outshe speaks decidedly enough  Dorcas  But I wull have yow like himit is  come in my hade and yow must and sholl love him 't will be wicked and undutiful in yow not to love him whan I bid yow love him and ha'n't I ollost told ye that the sin of undutifulness is worse than the sin of witchcraft and the sin of witchcraft is worse than the davvil hisself  Zella  Mother I own that it is my duty to please and obey you and I wish as you command it that I could like him but indeed it is not in my power  Dorcas  But since my Lord says 't is such a good match thof yow wo' n't love him yow can marry him ca'n't yow  Zella  My Lord you were so good as to embolden me by your permission to speak my sentimentsencouraged by your condescension I have spoken them with sincerity from my inmost soul Be graciously pleased then to plead with my Mother for me that she may have the kindness to indulge them and to permit me to spend my life in  Dorcas  Hold yar tongue this minute about being a Nun I sayshe sha'n't be a Nun that I swear and declare for northing shall ever maake me say yas to har going into a Nunneryfor har Father told me on his dathebed that if avvar I made a Nun of har that he shode not rest in his graveand I ha' no mind to see his Ghost I promise ye  Strasbourg  Why my fair one 't is impossible that you can have any objections to a marriage which my Lord considers as every way so advantageous to you  Zella  Pardon me Monsieur Strasbourg but I have objections  Strasbourg  You are quite in the wrong my little mistress  Dorcas  Whather she's right or wrong is nather hare nor thare I order it and that's enoughsaid is done with meso as he says yow are all in the wrong to jangle about it  Zella    weeping    Wrong indeed But my Lord led me into the errour when he bade me speak my real sentiments and without fearFor I was wrong in daring to hope for his pity his protection Alas Mother grant me time that I may try to reconcile my mind to your very hard commands in forcing me to marry a man whom I cannot like much less regard with preference  Strasbourg  The girl is stark staring mad I think not to like me  Marquis  Do not weep Zella I advise you as a friend to accept of Strasbourg why can you not love him  Zella  My Lord I can only obey my Mother to love him is not in my powerIf she insistnow I have lost my poor Father I have no one friend to save me from wretchednessunlessunless my Lord I might presume to hope for your mediation to save me from

Strasbourg  What the devil why you cannot be in earnest come come I am too much grieved to be in a humour for foolery You promised Zella to me and she shall marry me  Dorcas    in a passion stamping    I'd first hang and then drown'd myself before yow shall have har now  Strasbourg  Peace peace Dorcas a truce a truce here comes the Count D'Olstain the finest Gentleman and the most accomplished Scholar of the age and the lover of the beautiful Adelinda  SCENE SEVENTH  THE COUNT ZELLA STRASBOURG DORCAS  Count    at the bottom of the Stage to Strasbourg Zella's back being turned to them she appearing lost in thought    Is that the girl who is thought so pretty I met the Marquis and he praised her so highly that my curiosity brings me to see if she be such a peerless damselThat must be she with her back turned to us What a fine figure she is does her face correspond to it  Strasbourg  Yes my Lord that is Zella And she is completely beautiful  Count    advancing towards her    I find that they have told me truth Zella and that to see you is to be forced to admire you  Zella    turning to him but her eyes on the ground  My Lord is pleased to compliment  Count  Heavens surelythat voicethat face  Zella  My Lord you d stress me  Count  Have I not formerly had the pleasure of seeing you at the Convent of Montargo at the grate of the Abbess's parlour with my Sister Augusta D'Olstain whose friend you were  Zella  You have my Lord  Count  But in what a different dress do I now behold you a peasant's habit  Zella  My dress my Lord is now that which becomes my situation in life  Count  How then must you murmur against the injustice of fortune  Zella  No my Lord I murmur not This my Lord is my Mother whose indulgence placed me in a Convent for Education in a manner far above my sphere and rank in life  Dorcas  Yas har father said she should have the bast of larneinso I had har put thare in another guise name and ollost caparisoned har like a laady and she did not know no batter till I fached har home to keep me company  Count  Charming Zella what a fate is yours How do I pity and admire you  Strasbourg  You may admire her if you please but not too much my Lord  Count  Why so Strasbourg  Strasbourg  Because she is my bride elect  Count  She this Angel  Strasbourg  Even she my Lord are you too surprised at my condescension in marrying the Daughter of Dorcas  Count  No but I shall be surprised if she condescend to bestow a thought upon you  Strasbourg  Now your Lordship appears if you declare yourself my rival I stand less chance for Zella's favourYour rank fortune and accomplishments are to be sure almost irresistible attractions And though perhaps I ought to despair yet my vanity will not suffer me to desist For it would be a glory that would flatter the ambition of an Alexander's  heart if a poor Steward like me should win the affections of a beautiful angel at whose feet the Count D'Olstain had knelt in vain Now Zella tell us who has the best chance for your favour My Lord hereor poor Strasbourg Are you not in love with him come tell us the choice of your heart  Count  Strasbourg this liberty  Zella    to Strasbourg    My heart has made no choice And give me leave to tell you that in the present conversation you have treated me with less consideration and respect than even the lowly daughter of a peasant has a right to claim from every man who is not mean enough to take pleasure in giving distress where he has a secret fear that he has deserved by his ungenerous conduct to excite contempt  Count  Ah Heavens to find again at such a moment this divine assemblage of beauty sense judgmentO too charming Zella  Strasbourg  Hold my Lord you seem at present to forget that you are in love with my Young Lady Adelinda  Count  Peace Sir whether I forget or remember it is not your concern but mine  Strasbourg  Agreed my Lord but seeing you so deeply smitten with Zella's charms I as her friend▪ just take the liberty to  int your engagements your rank forbids you to court her honourablyand I  cannot permit you to court her otherwise as she is promised to me  Dorcas  Marry come up promised I scorn yar words  Strasbourg  Why yes you yourself promised her to me  Dorcas  Well than I mysalfmy very own salf Dorcas who stand here pointing at yow I now unpromise har mind yow that yow sha'n't have her  Strasbourg  We shall see that Dorcas my Lord here who is so successful a lover with Lady Adelinda will stand my friend I hope and court Zella's favour for me and his rhetoric I dare say will be irresistible especially as Zella has declared that her heart has made no choice therefore I hope to gain her favour if my Lord the Count will intercede for me  Count  Will you be pleased to hold your tongue Sir or quit the room Had you been my equal your insolent impertinence should have met with its proper chatisement  Strasbourg  Here comes your future Wife my Lordand if this conversation should go on with such spirit and gallantry you will make her as jealous as you have made me and then Zella will be triumphant indeed  SCENE EIGHTH  THE COUNT ADELINDA ZELLA STRASBOURG DORCAS  Adelinda  Ah Nurse how do you do I am right glad to see you  Dorcas  My dear dear yong Laady how do yow do  Adelinda  Well in health thank you Nurse How long have you been come  Dorcas  I camed this morning just now and here's my Darter Zalla come with me yow do'n't remember har yow ha'n't seen har since she was put to har larnin ont ye spake to har  Adelinda  So what are you come for my little Goody    Zella curtsies    Dorcas  My

 What is she going away for Stay girl and let's hear you speak properlycomeOh you give yourself airs do you  Zella  Pardon me Mademoiselle I do not know any to give myself  Adelinda  Do not you give yourself airs now  Zella  Then have the goodness to forgive my ignorance  and tell me that I may amend it what it is that offends you  Adelinda  You and your words little minx  Dorcas  Little minxButter yar words with a little manners 'T is my belief if I war to set Zalla to hunt the pigs she would use batter words to them and more civiller behalf than yow give to har Little minx indeed marry come up little minx  Adelinda  Why Nurse you are putting yourself into one of your passions  Dorcas  Because yow dominare over Zalla for northing and if I war not too well brad to use such words to my Lord Markis's Darter I should call yow a saucy slut for yar pains I brought Zalla on purpose to draw me yar picturbut Godlys I might have spared har the trouble of coming for a dancing bear from our fair might have sat for yar likeness yow are so bad mannered  Count  Silence woman you forget yourself Adelinda let Zella go away How can you delight in thus overpowering one who is too modest to cope with you and too meek willingly to give you offence  Adelinda  Cousin I by mistake turned courtier and having been most horridly mortified by my father who sent me hither I vented my illnature where I dared without reflecting that it was not deservedZella I have behaved very unhandsomely to you Be friends with me    takes her hand    Cousin you are a casuist in these matters have I  said enough for the offence which I gave this gentlelooking spirit for in good truth I feel sorry and ashamed at my own littlenessZella forgive me but I have offended myself more than I have offended you  Zella  O Mademoiselle  Count  Adelinda a moment of forgetfulness when so gracefully acknowledged is fully atoned And never did you look so charming in my eyes as at this momentI am going into your Father's Study shall I have the honour to conduct you thither  Adelinda  No not now go without me  Count  Zella the Marquis expects you and your Mother I am going to his apartment  SCENE NINTH  ADELINDA ZELLA DORCAS STRASBOURG  Dorcas  Well I 'spose I have affronted yow but yow should not behave so  Adelinda  Oh no Dorcas I am as good friends with you as ever I know you love me and the saucy slut of a dancing bear owes you no grudge I promise you But you and Zella must follow the Count  Dorcas  Why I ha' n't paid my rent to Mr Strawsbourg  Adelinda  My Father expects you and as he  sent me here he will think that I make you disobey his orders and then he will be in a raging passion with me  Dorcas  O Lord then I'll go for I ollost thought him mortal crabbed to yow and so I have told him but yar sarvant my dear yong laady I on't make yow mischief I'm sure so yar sarvant  SCENE TENTH  ADELINDA STRASBOURG  Adelinda  Strasbourg this Zella is very handsomeI am half afraid that you repent  Strasbourg  Repent my charming Adelinda had Zella the beauty of ten thousand angels though my eyes might see it yet my heart could be inspired with love and adoration only by your charms which are so far surpassing hers  Adelinda  Well I believe you  Strasbourg  Indeed you mayAnd have you not known from first to last why I let the family suppose that Zella had made an impression on my heart I could not otherwise have seen you without suspicion from my absences for though my pilgrim's weeds and your great charity cheated my Lady Abbess so that she suspected nothing good soul yet the barn building was too slight an excuse for your Father So I was glad you know to avail myself of his  suspicions about Zella but by great good luck he has forbidden me to think of her  Adelinda  Indeed  Strasbourg  Yes and from his breaking off the match I have a scheme which I trust will put the house in a confusion for a week to come therefore impute all that you hear of my passion for Zella to contrivance and never entertain a thought of my being attached to her But what can my charming Adelinda have to fear Is she not my wedded Wife my this day's Bride  Adelinda  Peace peace lest we be overheard We shall need all your schemes and contrivance for we are in more danger than I feared or you either  Strasbourg  Are we suspected  Adelinda  No noBut my marriage with the Count which you know was to be this weekis fixed for tomorrow  Strasbourg  But you can beg for time  Adelinda  That I tried for in vain My Father was peremptoryhe gave me my choice either to marry the Count tomorrow or return for life to my Convent And an escape from thence you know would be impossible  Strasbourg  Heaven help us What must we do  Adelinda  Fly this very evening  Strasbourg  That's well said but whither my charmer can we fly so as to avoid pursuit by the latter end of the week all would have been safely  readyMy plans were laid my Brother is preparing for our flight and to fly with usbut this nightwe cannot fly this nightno precautions takenmy Brother absentfor as soon as he had joined our hands he sat off for the coast in order to secure a ship  Adelinda  Follow him  Strasbourg  But whitherFor when he left me he had not determined what Port he would go to Adelinda we can never escape this night if we attempt it we shall be discovered and ruined past redemption  Adelinda  But I tell you that we must escape and this very night tooFor if we stay all must be confessed to morrowAnd think of the dreadful consequences  Strasbourg  DistractionWhat can we do  Adelinda  I must I think tell Nurse Dorcas the secret and persuade her to let us be concealed at her house till we can get clear off  Strasbourg  If she should betray us  Adelinda  She loves me too well to do that especially as she knows that your life would be forfeited to the law or fall a sacrifice to my father's first fury and that I should be a prisoner in some gloomy dungeon of a Convent for the rest of my miserable days With her assistance and your contrivance I think that we shall get off undiscovered  Strasbourg  On what a tottering precipice do we stand  Adelinda  Do not make me begin to think If we cannot escape horrour ensuesIf we do alas my gentle Mother's heart will breakI am afraid to thinkI dare not reflectAh and does your courage fail you Strasbourg  Strasbourg  Adelinda if you saw my heart though it beats with fear yet it is not for myself but for you A moment of distraction in spite of all my duty to my Master and all my respect for you made me discover my hopeless passion you pardoned this act of presumption and despairyou like an angel heard and pitied my sufferingsfatally heard and pitied them till you shared them O Adelinda do you not hate me do you not despise the selfishness that had not the courage to be wretched by itself I see with deep repentance for your sake the dreadful abyss into which you are going to be plunged Into what peril have I betrayed you  Adelinda  The peril is equal for bothOur regard for each other has been highly blameablebut it is too late now for repentance The hazard of our enterprise is not so great as you imagine  Strasbourg  O Adelinda my eternal gratitude and love will make it the study of my future days  Adelinda  Peace peace I believe you for when a man is disinterested enough to resign all hopes of fortune and runs the hazard of his life for marrying his master's daughterhe certainly loves her to desperation We must part now for sear we be surprised Meet me in an hour in the Alcove  When I see which way the land lies I can give you more directions Prepare me a disguise and make what arrangements you can for our departure Adieu  Strasbourg  As love conducts may it protect us both    Exeunt severally    End of the Second Act  Act Third  SCENE FIRSTA DRESSINGROOM  THE MARCHIONESS FLORA  Marchioness  I AM astonished that Strasbourg who thinks himself so adorable and a match for a Princess should condescend to think of the Daughter of Dorcas for a Wife My Lord's interfering and breaking off the match is to be sure a very extraordinary step yet I cannot think it a sufficient reason for your suspicions  Flora  My suspicions as you well know Madam have been but too often right And my Lord Marquis has had too many intrigues for me not to suspect him very much of entering into a new one when he prevents a pretty girl's marriage and takes away her Mother's authority by declaring himself her Guardian  Marchioness  Has he done that too as well as prevent the marriage  Flora  Yes Madam and Strasbourg is quite jealous about itI heard but little for it was Lucy whom he charged with the embassy to you but she begged me to tell it to you I believe that she thinks as I do for she seemed half frighted out of her wits she says that Strasbourg has puzzled and confounded  her by telling her of his jealousy I questioned her but she said she dared not speak what she thought and ran away from me I knew not what to think of her flutterings perhaps she is in love with him herself  Marchioness  Well do not tell me of such shadows of suspicions I have enough for serious uneasiness without anticipating vexations  Flora  But Madam Strasbourg says that he will lay his life that the Marquis has designs upon the Girl and that he will find her a very easy conquest unless you interpose Yet he charged Lucy not to tell you that my Lord was in love with her for fear of making you uneasy but he is sure that he is and that the girl perceives it and that as she is quite a village coquette an artful little monkey she will know how to secure her conquest  Marchioness  I hope that my Lord is more honourable than to seduce her  Flora  You may hope it Madam but you will be disappointed If I were you I would order the little baggage into my presence box her ears and command her to be turned out of doors She should not stay a minute under my roof  Marchioness  Such conduct would ill become any woman And though my Lord appears to be relapsing into his former errours yet who knows but what he may have some praiseworthy motive for his conduct  Flora  Thus you always excuse him Madam  and I could bite my fingers for madness to see how you appear to study to deceive yourself When I am sure Madam that in your heart you must be as unhappy as jealousy that worst of demons can make you If I were you I would make a fine bustle and havoc about it all the world should know how vilely I was treated  Marchioness  That would be the sure way to make my Husband regard me as an enemy and he would soon hate me however unjustly for having the temerity to proclaim his failings  Flora  O Heavens I lose all patience Faith I shall swear presently as the men do to vent their rage  Marchioness  Here comes the Marquis  Flora  Now for it then Now we shall hear what excuse he will make for breaking off the match  SCENE SECOND  THE MARQUIS THE MARCHIONESS FLORA  Marquis  Do you know Madam what is going forward  Flora    aside    Oh yes but too well  Marquis  I am charmed and so will you  Marchioness  And with what my Lord  Marquis  With a young Person who at first sight  captivates the heart and on conversing with her astonishes the mind The more you look at her and listen to her the more the strikes you and you are attached to her by an irresistible impulse Her gracefulness her understanding her beauty are enchanting and the delicate modesty of her deportment adds a thousand winning graces to the bloom of youth in the most lovely animated countenance that I ever beheld  Flora    aside    If this be a true likeness the Girl is either angel or demonor a witch at least  Marchioness  And pray my Lord who is this young Person  Marquis  Zella the Daughter of Dorcas and of poor Orland  Marchioness  You describe her to be charming indeed my Lord  Marquis  I describe her as she is with beauty that inspires love and a mind that creates esteem She strikes at once as an accomplished and attracts as an amiable elegant young woman  Marchioness  Truly this Girl must be bewitching else you exaggerate her attractions very much  Marquis  Believe me Madam I do not exaggerate what I tell you is the simple truth I have been conversing with her this hour in my study Dorcas through foolish vanity has given her an excellent education and for her years I am astonished at her knowledge I most sincerely pity the suffering which the elegant mind of this gentle Girl must  endure in being subjugated to the authority of so rough and turbulent a woman as Dorcas is and I feel the tenderest friendship for this poor child  Flora    aside to the Marchioness    A tender friendship what a tender phrase  Marchioness    to Flora    Hush  Flora    aside    Making a confident of his own Wife well there is something new under the Sun witness this confabulation  Marquis  The poor Girl applied to me to set aside her Mother's project of marrying her to Strasbourg  Marchioness  It seems to me my Lord that Strasbourg's proposal does her much honour even with all the beauty which you describe her to have she could scarcely expect so advantageous an offer  Marquis  But she testified so strong an aversion for him that through pity for her I absolutely forbad the marriage  Flora    aside to the Marchioness    In order to reserve Zella for himself Keep a sharp look out Madam  Marchioness  Strasbourg has sent to me through Lucy and Flora to beg that I will speak to you in his behalf therefore permit me to become his advocate I shall esteem it as the highest favour done to me if you will put him again upon good terms with Dorcas and her Daughter and persuade the Girl to accept of so good an offer of marriage  Marquis  That is impossible  Marchioness  How impossible my Lord▪ Dorcas▪  it seems had consented very wisely to the marriage And why my Lord should you protect a rebellious vain Girl in her opposition to her Mother's authority and judgment You should rather enforce her obedience than encourage her in her undutiful obstinacy  Marquis  Zella Madam did not want to have her obedience to her Mother enforced upon her The sweet Girl was ready to obey her unfeeling mandate with all the respectful submission of a Daughter and all the resignation of a martyr I declare to you Madam that but for her tears I should have thought an angel stood before me when after pleading for pity in vain she spoke the strong sense which she had of her duty to her Mother and of her resolution to obey her though at the price of all her future happiness Then and not till then I interposed my authority in her favour The thoughts of her being devoted to misery pierced my heart with grief whilst the fortitude of her resignation almost awed me I cannot consent that she shall be driven to despair it would be a deep suffering to myself  Marchioness  I am astonished my Lord at the impression which this Girl has made upon you  Marquis  Indeed she has charmed my very soul  Flora    aside    I must go where I may storm and swear at my ease for my very blood boils in my veins  Marquis  You are silent Madam  Flora    aside    Silent why what should she say to this  Confidence  Marquis  What does Flora say  Flora  Who I my Lord I say nothing I only meditate to myself  Marquis  Oh meditate aloud else we cannot profit from your wisdom  Flora  No my meditations would not please your Lordship  Marquis    angrily    Then keep them wholly to yourself I will not suffer muttering meditations  Marchioness  Laugh as I do my Lord at her officiousness And let us confine the conversation to your Steward What is to be said to him as the result of my intercession to your Lordship Pronounce his fate my Lord  Marquis  Well then I pronounce his fate And though I set going the perpetual motion of Flora's tongue yet I forbid Strasbourg ever to think of Zella  Marchioness  Enough my Lord I will urge my suit no further  Marquis  I am come to beg a favour of you Madam  Marchioness  Command me my Lord What can I do to oblige you  Marquis  Honour Zella with your protection and take her into your service as one of your waitingwomen    The Marchioness testifies uneasiness and Flora surprise    I have promised to become her Guardian for Dorcas is so tyrannical absurd and wrongheaded that I am sure so sensible and so gentle a girl cannot be happy with her And when you see Zella you will think of het as I do  Marchioness    agitated  As I do not know her I may be permitted without offence to doubt whether she will make the same impression upon me as she has done upon your Lordship But my Lord as you desire it if I approve of her she shall be received amongst the number of my attendants  Marquis  O Madam do not think of refusing this favour to one so every way amiable I will send this charming girl to you but for decency's sake order her to be dressed properly her peasant's habit is too ordinary and too particular to be worn here Condescend Madam to honour her with a gracious reception Receive her with that benignant kindness which you have ever uniformly extended to modest merit    Exit Marquis    SCENE THIRD  THE MARCHIONESS FLORA  Flora  You see Madam what credit is due to my suspicions You are I hope convinced by this time that my Lord is in love with this Girl but his asking you to take her into your service is beyond all bearing  Marchioness  Heaven grant me patience  Flora  Well when I have done being in a passion I'll pray for patience too and I am sure that  we shall stand in need of a double dose for you will find that my suspicions are realities and not visions  Marchioness  Alas Flora so I begin to fear  Flora  I am glad that you are convinced of it Madam for it is very mortifying to have one's penetration called in question when one is so certain of being in the right  Marchioness  And yet there is something very extraordinary and very cruel in my Lord's conduct if he have any bad intentions towards this Girl Have you seen her Is she so very charming  Flora  No I have not set eyes upon her But Lucy and the Servants who saw her speak of her as the Marquis does And Strasbourg said that every body at Olstain was in love with her for her pretty face  SCENE FOURTH  THE MARCHIONESS FLORA A SERVANT conducting ZELLA  Zella  Is it here  Servant  Yes and that is my Lady    Exit Servant    Flora  I believe  Zella  Oh How my heart trembles  Flora  I believe Madam that this must be our beauty come to pay her respects  Marchioness  Let her come forward  Flora  Come come in come in sight  Zella  Fear and respect  Flora  You are bid to come forwardwhy do you not move  Zella  You frighten me what have I done amiss that you are so angry with meMy Lord sent me hitherI should not have dared to come without being ordered  Flora  We know it walk towards my Lady  Marchioness    looking at Zella    Heavens what an amiable countenance  Zella  I fear that I have unknowingly done wrong in coming I  feel  that you are displeased Madam I am very sorryyet indeedI was told by my Lord himself to comePardon me that I did so I most respectfully retire  Marchioness  No Zella staySo I find that you have insinuated yourself into my Lord's favour  Zella  Alas Madam does the pity which my Lord has shewn to a poor fatherless girl like me offend you  Marchioness  Zella pity is not always restrained within proper boundsI am neither unkind nor unjust nor willingly suspicious but Strasbourg is jealous and you know very well his reasons for being so  Zella  No Madam I know of no reasons for Strasbourg's jealousy I only know that he asserted pretensions to my hand but I cannot love him This  in the honest sincerity of my heart I declared before the Marquis Orphaned as I am he had the goodness to promise that he would supply my Father's place and like an indulgent Father he set aside the engagement which my Mother had entered into so very contrary to my inclinations Indeed Madam had I been forced to fulfil it my future life short as I hope it would have been would have run in one continued stream of grief disgust and wretchedness  Marchioness  Zella a girl like you should fear to excite the partiality of a man of high station Your beauty might awaken love in a colder heart than that of my Lord and I am told that the loves you and that you know that he loves you and therefore you refuse Strasbourg  Zella  O MadamThink not thus I beseech you  Marchioness  What else can I think when you refuse so very advantageous an offer as that which Strasbourg makes you Your beauty has seduced  Zella  Gracious Lady say it not againTrust me and I speak as truly to you as I should were you a messenger from heaven trust me that if the little beauty which I am mistress of had seduced the affections of your Lord Honour would instantly have made me a voluntary exile from this house nor should I have even dared to come into your presence A thought of such love as you mean never entered into my mind till you yourself cruellypardon me the expressionsuggested from your own suspicions  this detestable idea the very existence of which I had not even feared  Flora    aside    Well if she don't speak truthI must own that she can tell lies with the most innocent grace I ever saw  Zella  Had you had a Son Madam who had distinguished me by his pity I should have shrunk back from it fearing to find beneath so specious a garb a licentious Lover But in your Lord I saw only the Father whose protection I wanted and whose goodness emboldened me to forget his rank to fly to him with open arms and hang weeping on his neck  Flora    aside    Has she wings at her back or has she a cloven foot in her shoe is she angel or demon  Zella  And shall my Lord's generous compassion for me be interpreted into a crime or my gratitude for his goodness into unhallowed affection Can it beand can you Madam thus wrongfully interpret his pity or thus wrest my actions from their true motivesYou whom my gracious Lord bade me come and see and revere and love as I did the Saints in Heaven for that you were good and kind like them  Marchioness  This girl Flora melts my heart  Flora  O the little Sorceress she has the art of taking one by surprise  Zella  Alas I know not art Perhaps I should be silent wanting the judgment to speak as I ought but I have spoken from my heart and without guile  Your suspicions Madam have wounded my very soul and have so astonished and overwhelmed my mind that what to speak or what to think I am altogether ignorant  Marchioness  Do you wish Zella to give me a proof that my suspicions are groundless  Zella  I have no dearer wish  Marchioness  Marry Strasbourg  Zella  O Madam what have you asked  Flora    aside    If she consent to that I shall think her a Jew Turk or Infidel if she do I give her up directly  Zella  Can you have the cruelty Madam to bring me to such a test as that only to eradicate your unjust suspicions Can you think that I had so slight a sense of filial duty as to plead against my own Mother's authority if I could have made such a sacrifice at any one's request  Flora  O Madam let me plead for her indeed she may be a very good girl without marrying Strasbourg  Zella  Madam you hold the power to put an end to all your fears  Marchioness  How Zella tell me but How  Zella  Overcome my Mother's objections to my being a Nun Condescend to be present Madam when I take my Vows and bid the world everlastingly farewell Then judge by the serenity with which I dedicate myself to heaven how free my soul is from guilt or impurityAnd dear Lady notwithstanding  your injustice yet from henceforth will I never offer up a prayer to the throne of Mercy for myself without mingling a petition with it for your felicity May all the Saints and Angels have you in their charge    Going    Marchioness  Yet stay ZellaDid you wish to remain here did you wish to live with me  Zella  Though my reception freezes nay terrifies me though your suspicions hurt and grieve me yet never before stood I in a presence that inspired my heart with such tender affection with such respectful awe But after what you have said Madam I ought not to wish to remain hereYet it would make me happybut I relinquish even the wishfor I had rather die a thousand deaths than give you even a shadow for the slightest uneasiness  Flora  Dear Madam let her stay I will be surety for her  Marchioness  She is her own security Too charming too amiable Girl you have in spite of my reason conquered my fears and subdued every objection You shall remain here you shall live with me as it is your own wish as well as my Lord's particular request  Zella  And do you indeed consent that I should stay  Marchioness  With perfect satisfaction and as a pledge of your duty and attachment to me let what has now passed be kept within your own bosom  Zella  Most sacredly gracious Lady living in  the constant presence of you and of my Lord Marquis will make me happy beyond what I had ever thought of being in this world  Flora  Let us remember the Marquis's orders to have Zella properly dressed Lady Adelinda's Wardrobe will on her marriage with the Count be given away amongst us servants tomorrow and therefore may I not dress Zella from it now  Marchioness  Yes and without consulting me  Flora  Then she shall for once be dressed indeed I want to see how this diamond will look when it is richly set Then Madam I will shew Zella to my Lord and this compliance with his orders will make my peace with him for my saucy meditations  Marchioness  Be it so But leave me now my heart is overpowered and solitude will best relieve it  Flora    to Zella    Mind that you continue to hate our fop of a Steward When I have dressed you I shall find him out and fight a good battle

Daughter  Adelinda  But Strasbourg  Strasbourg  My sweet Adelinda you have consented to the greater dishonesty and now you pretend to have scruples Truly you are too nice for the courage which you have shewn till now  Adelinda    with indignant grief  And you for  whom I have shewn it are to become the punisher of my transgression against my Parents by involving me in fresh unheardof GuiltTo

only told Lucy what I saw and what I heard and what I thought and what I suspected And you know as well as I that my Lord's heart is very easy of access to every handsome face But if my Lord orders and you advise me not to think of ZellaWhy I have forgotten  herShe would have a pretty fortune it is true But my dear Flora I shall not regret Zella for I now feel that my heart is powerfully

you come when I ordered you away    Recollecting herself    'T is very hard Flora that I cannot speak to Nurse without your haunting me  Flora  Lord Mademoiselle what are you in such a passion for I do not want to haunt you One of the Footmen was running into all the rooms to find you So I supposing that you were here still took his message  Adelinda  Well dispatch what is it  Flora  A Man who says that he is Zella's Uncle begs very earnestly to see you I wanted him to tell me his business but he would notI suppose he wants you to ask some favour from the Marquis he says that he is his tenant  Adelinda  Well where is he  Flora  In the dining parlour  Adelinda  Dear Nurse go and wait for me in my dressingroom  Dorcas  No my dear young Laady let me go along with yow I beg  Adelinda  Well you may if you chuse it    Exeunt    SCENE TENTHA GARDEN  THE MARQUIS THE COUNT at a little distance    Marquis  Here comes the Count but he seems in a very gloomy humour  Count    to himself not seeing the Marquis    There is no room for doubtYet I would fain disbelieve it but I cannot  Marquis  Count I attend your summons and here in the Garden as you requested But what has happened to you my dear Cousin you seem so agitated Recover yourself    walks from him    Count  I neither dare speak nor yet be silent I dread the furious transports of his rageMy dear Marquis I have an affair to divulge to you which it imports you to be informed of But before I will consent to speak you must promisenay take a solemn Oaththat you will stifle and triumph over the first impulses of painful feelings which I am unfortunately obliged to excite  Marquis  Why this preamble  Count  Alas it is but too requisiteFor I have a most cruel heartwounding affair to break to you  Marquis  Heavens what can have happened that requires such preparation  Count  What half distracts meAnd you have not the least suspicion of it Would to Heaven that I could conceal from you for ever a secret which terrifies meand whichmy Lord dishonours our whole family  Marquis  Give me to know it that my guardian sword may swift revenge the act which stains my honourWhat is it who has dared invade it  Count  Sheath your Sword my Lord could that have made reparation I would not have spoken till mine had redeemed our honour It would be a prodigy to hear with temper or even patience what I have to relate Therefore my dear Marquis on your honour swear that you will not listen to the first violent emotions of your soul Indeed my Lord you must make a noble effort to conquer yourself in order to assist in searching to the bottom of a mysterious affair the completion of whichif it be not now too late to prevent itcan only be prevented without public dishonour by the calmest prudence and alas one of the unhappy accomplices demands your tenderest humanity  Marquis  Who Who is itTorture me not with suspense  Count  The terms my Lord or I am silent  Marquis  Well then I swear give you my solemn word of honour that I will restrain myself within the bound of prudence Now what am I to learn  Count  A fact which staggers belief  Marquis  Tell me at once the worst  Count  Adelinda has the indiscretion to carry on a clandestine correspondence with a Man whose specious manners have gained her affections  Marquis  Who has dared to attempt this  Count  Think my Lord of her extreme youth and inexperience and let that consideration summon all the Father in your heart when you shall hear the rest  Marquis  This caution makes me dread I know not whatSpare me a moment lest I grow mad at hearing itNow speak the worst  pause    Speak I stand preparedI hope I do for worse than I shall hear  Count  My honoured Kinsman much I grieve to speak itStrasbourg  Marquis  Strasbourg and Adelinda D'Olstain Horrour it cannot beMy Daughtercarry on a clandestine correspondence with my Servant 't is impossible it exceeds belief  Count  My Lord had there been but one doubt in my mind on which hope might have anchored trust me I would not thus have wrung a Father's heart I have not spoken on bare suspicion but upon unequivocal conviction dreadful certainty  Marquis  My Daughter my only child to be the curse of my age the dishonour of my house And dares my hireling Servant thus prophane my honouraccursed Villainby my hand he dies  going in a rage    Count  My Lord your oath to me  Marquis  I must have vengeance Stay me not  Count  My dear Lord that vengeance would only add poison to the wound The detection of this affair will enough punish the wretched aggressors  Marquis  How was this infernal correspondence discovered Speak all you know  Count  Lucy Adelinda's maid suspected this strange connection but dared not speak her suspicions She determined to watch both my cousin and Strasbourg She saw them this day before dinner in deep conference near the Alcove they entered it she drew near behind itShe overheard enough of their conversation to find that they intend to escape this night  Marquis  The VillainYou have prevented my taking justice on him myself but thank Heaven the Laws of France shall give me ample vengeance A Public ignominious death is the awarded punishment for a crime like his Ungrateful wretch He whom I trusted as my confidential Servant who was in duty bound to guard me from injury yet He whilst I sleep turns Robber steals my Child and murders the peace and honour of my whole family by this vilely disgraceful seduction  Count  My Lord you must forego even that justice which the laws would give you Strasbourg must not be put to death  Marquis  Who shall prevent itThough I have sworn my Lord not to be his executioner I  have taken no oath to screen him from the Laws Justice shall take place  Count  My dear Lord think only of what it will be best to do in this dark affair and do not aggravate the disgrace by proclaiming it through the world Arm yourself with the requisite patience If they be not yet marriedthough I fear that they are my Cousin may yet be saved  Marquis  Count I feel your friendship and attachment in your conduct at this crisis but for your prudence my rage would even now flame out too impetuously for my judgment and I should at this moment heed only my indignation and my vengeance Prescribe my conduct your reason can best guide in this deplorable affair what can you advise what must I do  Count  See Lucy my Lord and judge from her account which though certain as to their correspondence and their intended flight is not such as I could make out fromwhether they be actually married When you be certified as to that command your anger sufficiently to see StrasbourgInsist upon his quitting the Kingdom for ever as the sole means of exemption he can hope from forfeiting his life in an ignominious manner to the offended laws of his country Conceal this terrible affair from the Marchioness till every remedy is applied that can soften it to a Mother's too tender heart  Marquis  I will endeavour to do this and to suppress my rage    the Marquis turns away from the  Count and after a struggle with himself goes to him and takes his hand with much emotion    My Cousin my Friend The Son of my choice I  stops short  I release you fully from every engagement with me upon this unhappy Girl's account After this degeneracy a marriage with her would dishonour you without removing the stain from our house Let your heart select a worthier partner My Titles must be yours And you can now no longer object to my settling my whole fortune upon you Adelinda shall end her days in a Conventdishonoured by herself she is but too justly disinherited by me  Count  Marquis if you have any friendship for me let it be shewn by your pity for my unfortunate CousinMitigate I conjure you her sentence Let Strasbourg's exile be the sole forfeiture to save his life Do not make poor Adelinda purchase it by forcing her to take the Veil Think of her youth Do not cancel the strong the sacred bond of parental lovelet naturepitycommon humanity plead for herand do not irrevocably fix her fate in the first effusion of your grief and indignation However wayward Adelinda has a high strung mind a noble soul and a good heart Let her not be lost drive her not to utter desperation  Marquis  If I restrain the transports of my rage 't is all that I can dothe very name of Father I disclaim I am henceforth her judge My soul is so stung by her infamous conduct that if she were now before  me I fear it would be impossible for me to refrain from even a Roman Justice on her guilty head my reason would forsake me and some rash act would be the fatal consequence I leave you Count I will strive to compose myself and then I will see this Villain  Count  I feel your distress would I could alleviate it    Exit Marquis    SCENE ELEVENTH  THE COUNT ZELLA just coming in sight    Count  I dread the transports of his rage Heaven grant that he may be able to surmount them Poor Adelinda to what has her folly reduced her But what do I beholdIs it you Zella What additional charms Ah my Angel why are your eyes swimming in tears  Zella  I have been weeping this hour my Lord at being thus disguised 'Tis a sad mockery and I am enough mortified at it But is he not here  Count  Whom Zella do you seek  Zella  The Marquis I came by my Lady's order all ashamed as I am to present myself this figure before him  Count    aside    Oh why is she a cottager cruel custom imperious honour  Zella  How grieved he seems  Count    aside    The world will not censure me if I win her heart and then seduce herbut if I marry her the taunting finger of the hand of scorn will be for ever pointed at me as one degraded and dishonoured by marrying a peasant  Zella  Perhaps he is angry that I stay    as she is going he turns round    Count  Zella stay  Zella  My Lord I am going to seek for Flora whom I expected to find here with the Marquis  Count  Then she will be here presently  Zella  I will go and meet her    going    Count  Stay Zella I wish to speak with you Know that I love and adore you charming Zella and that I must be miserable unless I can win your heart  Zella  My Lord this language hurts as much as it astonishes me  Count  Why Zella  Zella  Because my Lord does not maintain the honour of his own rank thus infringing upon the decorum which my humble fortune has a right to expect even from him    going    Count  Stay Zella Ah wherefore so much pride why shun me  Zella  Pardon me my Lord it is not pride I am only grieved that you have made it requisite for me to leave you now and shun you hereafter  Count  Ah cruel shun me because I love you For I must confess that my heart burns with the most  ardent passion for you    Zella attempts to go the Count taking her hand detains her    Zella  I beg my Lord that you will permit me to go away I can bear no part in such a conversation as this isI cannot listen to it  Count  O Zella you must hear me must listen to all the ardent wishes of my soul Love fires my mind almost to madness Zella my passion shall know no bounds in its gratitude if I can but win your heart Whatever my fortune can purchase or my interest command shall wait upon your will and every wish of your heart shall be indulged My charming Girl will you not in pity love me  Zella  No my Lord nor even hear you if I were at liberty to retire Assure yourself that I shall never love or even pity you  Count  Cruel Girl not pity that misery which you yourself cause Ah give me at least a ray of hope that I may win your heart by my faithful attachment my constant adoration Look kindly on me save me from despair  Zella  My dear LordCount you terrify me Awake from this dream recover your sensesI would fain esteem you It would give me great pleasure to have reason to respect you but if you speak thus to me it will not be in my power  Count  Zella 'tis impossible to obey you I have long loved you and to adoration admired your beauty and accomplishments but I fled from your charms I begged of my Sister to bring you no more to the  grate with herI hoped that I had overcome my passion for you but it was only stifled not subdued The seeing you thus unexpectedly has thrown my soul into tumults which I can scarcely support But your coldness your crueltyAre you then insensible to love and admiration  Zella  I have heard too much of both Release my hand I beg of you my Lord  Count  Zella I dare not If I release your hand you will fly from me What would I not give to subdue your cruelty and to win your heartAh help me to restore my peace Surely my love may hope for your pity if you will not reward it by a richer giftyour heart Say then in kind commiseration for my suffering love that you will pity me Whence this fullen silence this soulpiercing Scorn  Zella  From the most poignant sensations from Grief from Shame from Indignation from hatred at your selfishness from contempt at your meanness How insidious are you my Lord thus pretending to admire my beauty whilst you are seeking to destroy it for by invading the innocent serenity of my bosom you would cover my face with the pale hue of discontent and drown my eyes with tears How selfish and artful it is to plead your passion for me which seeks only my destruction How mean and contemptible to ask my love or implore my pity Why should I love you What pity or what tenderness can my mind feel for you You yourself my Lord now teach me what regard I ought to have for  the repose of your heart when you seek to plant endless torments in mine  Count  O Zella think not thus hardly of me Does not my love deserve some regard  Zella  Oh no it makes you an object of detestation not of affection Pardon my Lord the disrespectful language which you force from me Let me beg of you to retain that respect which I wish to pay to you by neither prolonging now nor ever renewing this conversationPermit me to departLowly as I am I have a right to be much offended at this insolent detension The Count D'Olstain should be too noble to exert his privileges unjustly against the weak and defenceless Unhand me my Lord    The Count very respectfully releases her hand She instantly goes    Count  Zella I beseech you hear me    kneels    Kneeling I beg it I ask no love Hear me I conjure you  she returns  Zella  Why will you thus artfully distress me Rise my Lord If kneeling would have prevented this conversation most willingly would I have knelt to save my mind from the pain which the remembrance of it will for ever give me  Count  Zella I knew not that I should see you heretherefore I could have formed no fixed plan of villainy and when I declared my love I had no settled intentions I doted on you to distraction I would have given the empire of the world to gain your heart And if you would have listened to my  love or had you condescended to parley with me I own that I should have hoped to gain your affections and such is the difference of our Rank I should have expected to win a Mistress where the prejudices of the world did not permit me to chuse a Wife  Zella  My Lord I feared that I was to understand all this The repetition only wounds me further There needs no explanation I am enough hurt enough distressed    going    Count  Oh stay I will no further distress you I have no libertine hopes These initiatory advances thus properly thus indignantly repulsed I can have none that virtue which will not parley is not to be overcome Accept of me charming Zella as an honourable Lover and if I can make myself an interest in your heart I will take you to my arms raise you to my rank make you my Wife  Zella  My LordI cannot love you as you wish Our hearts are not formed for each otherYour own honour forbids you all connection with me Lady Adelinda is your destined Bride  Count  Know my sweet Zella that I am at liberty to offer you my vows The Marquis on this very spot has just released me from all my engagements with my Cousin  Zella    with emotion    Ah my Lord what do you tell me  Count  Some family reasons have put an end to the projected marriage Therefore my love as it is pure and honourable cannot offend you now  Zella  Your being at liberty my Lord cannot raise the lowliness of my birth the abjectness of my situation  Count  And if it did could you then love me Answer me Zella let me flatter myself that you could speak my Angel    Zella pauses much distressed    Zella  My Lord as the thing itself is impossible no answer can be made  Count  Are you then insensible even to a laudable ambition Do you not wish to shine in a more elevated rank where a soul like yours would find equal fellowship with cultivated spirits Could you not take a generous pleasure in making the man who adores you happy  Zella  Alas I find that birth and fortune would now indeed have charms for me  Count  I understand you and I am delighted to believe  Zella  O my Lord believe nothing do not deceive yourself my heart must retain its indifference It may be ambitious in its wishes but it is rational in its expectations I must converse with you no more The World calls you the most amiable of men O my Lord respect my peace of mind and do not strive to make me think you so  Count  Yes Zella to make you think so shall be the business of my life  Zella  My Lord the prejudices of the world will not permit you to think of mewho am only a peasant's daughterwithout degradation to yourself  Count  My Love charming Zella shall defy the unjust prejudices of the World  Zella  Never for me my Lordfor were I even so unhappy as to esteem you as you wish my mind is too high strung to bear the idea of dishonouring your rank and consequence in society by a disgraceful alliance every way unworthy of youForget me my Lord I never will be your WifeI must as bound in honour and duty communicate this conversation to my Lord Marquis and he will fix my future residence where you the Heir of all his titles and the Representative of his illustrious House shall never see me moreLet your heart make a worthier choice I will consecrate mine to my Maker and dedicate my future days to his service I will for ever renounce the world but though buried in the obscurity of a Cloister the knowledge of your prosperity and happiness will sometimes pleasingly bring back my mind to the social scene of worldly affairs Adieu farewell my Lord

when thou hast murdered my peace and honour and driven my soul to madness how darest thou mock me with a sound like Joy  Adelinda  No my dear Lord I mock you not I only dread to speak fearing the conflict of such fierce extremes as Grief and Joy Collect your soul my Lord Think O think that I come to bring you peace But seeing you thus agonized with Grief and Rage I fear to tell the Joy I came to give you  Marquis  Speak nor presume to trifle with my vengeance hope not by new deceit to escape from my too tardy Justice Speak and speak truth if thou hast ought to utter  Adelinda  I come to take the dagger from your heart with which unwillingly I pierced it Truth Honour Justice bade me comefor rough and rugged as my humour is yet still my bosom owns an honest heart Father no more for I am not your Child    the Marquis trembling drops his Sword    I kneel to my Liege Lord for pardon for my fond ambitious Mother who placed her Wren within your Eagle's nestFor I my Lord am Zella Orland's Daughter and the gentle Maiden whose enchanting beauty and graceful manners have so won all hearts is the true Adelinda and your noble Daughter  Marquis  O Heavens can this be true    Raises Adelinda    Adelinda  Read this writing and convince yourself  giving a letter    Marquis    opening the letter    Hah this is Orland's writing my deceased farmer Dorcas's husband Why was this mystery concealed till now  Adelinda  Because my Lord I have but now learned this guilty secret My real Father's Brother brought me within this hour that letterMy poor Father found out the deceit but my unhappy Mother's threats prevented him from revealing it till he was upon his deathbed when he told it to his Brother and with such circumstances as avouch the  truth and which await your hearing from my Uncle who was terrified by my Mother's threats of destroying herself from disclosing it at first but finding that she was coming hither he followed her determined to tell it to me as my Father had directed him  Marquis  What obstinate iniquity in Dorcas  Adelinda  My Lord she no longer persists She is now with the Marchioness confessing her guilt and folly I disdained to continue the Impostor whatever advantages of fortune might if I had fled have resulted to me from it I hastened to make this welcome relation to you hoping to spare your soul the Grief and Indignation by which I found it agonized I did not know that my marriage with Strasbourg was discovered till I saw your sword pointed at his breast But my Lord let my real father's letter vouch for the truth of what I speak  Marquis    reading    To the Lady Adelinda D'Olstain  My Brother will certify to you that you are my Daughter and I charge you as you hope for the blessing of Heaven not to assist in carrying on the fraud which has been for so many years practised against the Marquis and Marchioness D'Olstain For she who is called Zella is the real Adelinda D'Olstain their Daughterand you are Zella Dorcas's Child and mineAnd you were exchanged by my Wife when the Marchioness followed my Lord into Spain when he went there as AmbassadorI am upon my deathbed and I cannot die easy nor with the hope of forgiveness  for my other sins without confessing this great sin and doing all that remains in my poor power to repair the wrong which I have wickedly concealed from my Lord and suffered to be done to him in the person of his noble Daughter Do you yourself reveal this wickedness to my Lord and implore him that the pardon of your poor Mother may be the reward of your Justice and Integrity The blessing of your dying Father is yours only as you obey this warning from his timeless Grave  "ORLAND"  Adelinda  If my Lord the act of Duty and common Justice which I have just performed may so embolden me to ask again with hope a favour    kneeling    pardon my Mother  Marquis  For the sake of your Father's honest repentance I forgive Dorcas Yet gracious Heaven may I believe this wondrous providence  Adelinda  My dying Father attested it my Mother owns it and if you want stronger proof you have internal evidence my Lord for in spite of care and education am I not in temper more like Dorcas than like the gentle spirit of the Marchioness nay has not your own heart spokenfor did you not this very morning bid me go and see Zella and blush at beholding a Peasant Girl far more worthy to be your Daughter than I wasBut here comes my Mother to confirm this welcome truth  SCENE SIXTH  THE MARQUIS ADELINDA DORCAS  Dorcas  sobbing    Yas Yas This is my Dartar and Zella is yars My Laady Marchioness has forgon me and she promised me before I would come that I should be forgon by yow tooso I hope yow'll keep har words  Marquis  Was ever joy like mine    To Adelinda    Worthy young Woman to determine with so much courage and resolution thus generously at once to degrade yourselfWhen if you had fled so large a fortune must have been yours if you had continued the deceit  Adelinda  I am happy my Lord in your joy and recovered peace  Dorcas  She has narthar taste nor spurrit she is glad at what maakes me cry and sobA silly fule she had rather be my Child than a laady  Marquis    taking Adelinda's hand    For your sake Adelinda I forgive your Mother's crimeYour integrity shall not only screen her guilt from punishment but bring you great reward  SCENE SEVENTH  THE MARQUIS ADELINDA ZELLA DORCAS  Zella  O my Lord I rejoice to find you    The Marquis takes her hand but from emotion is unable to interrupt her    You must not think amiss of me for what my Duty makes me tell youThe noble Count your Cousin poor and humble as I am talks of marrying me And because I would not consent to keep this from you for a time he is raving wildly like one distracted and he says that he will carry me away without my consent and that I shall be his WifeI beseech you my Lord not to suppose that I have been consenting to any clandestine correspondence with your noble RelationIndeed I have notfor I know too well that I am not born to such high fortune as to be his WifeSpeak to me my LordI am much grieved to see you thus affected I know that you will not let me live with the Marchioness nowBut say that you are not angry with me and send me to whatever Convent you please and I will instantly take the Veil    The Marquis clasps her in his arms    My Lord    withdrawing from him    Marquis  O my Child my ChildYour pure heart must help me to thank Heaven for joy too big for words  SCENE EIGHTH  THE MARQUIS THE COUNT ADELINDA ZELLA DORCAS  Marquis  Is it true my dear Count that you love Zella  Count  To distraction and if she will accept my hand I think that her virtues and her mental accomplishments will gain my pardon from the world for overlooking her want of birth  Marquis  Count this homage to Zella's virtues does you honour and if her heart consents she has my leave to reward you for your disinterested love Receive her from my hand my Lord  Zella    preventing the Marquis from giving her hand to the Count    Never my Lord shall he receive my handI will not injure his fortune nor stain his honour by so disgraceful an allianceYou yourself can never mean it  Marquis  Yes Zella for in marrying you he will espouse my Daughter You You are my Child    Clasping Zella half fainting in his arms    Zella  Is such happiness for me And do you own me for your Child  Marquis  Yes my dear Zella  Count  Just Heavenmy Lord say what do your words mean  Marquis  Zella is my Daughter  Zella    quitting the Marquis's arms and clasping  her hands together with great earnestness    Am I indeed your Child  Marquis  No longer doubt for you are Adelinda and my Child changed by Dorcas in your infancy and now restored to me  Zella    to Dorcas    Mother    unable to

Adelinda if I had had the conscientious courage to contemn Fashion and break through an unnatural custom in giving my Child to a Stranger to suckle how many years of  pleasure should I have enjoyed in

Introduction  HENRY De S Baron of D was betrothed to Eulalia De Le a Daughter of the Marquis De Le An offer more suitable to the ambitious views of the Marquis being made to him for his Daughter he compelled her to write a refusal to her first Lover which was accompanied by a peremptory one from himself The young Lord unable to bear the thoughts of seeing the amiable woman he doated on given in marriage to another secretly quitted his house leaving a letter behind him written in a style which indicated a mind bordering on despair and madness declaring that all search after him would be in vain desiring in a formal manner that his Kinsman might as his Heir take possession of his Titles and Estate giving to Eulalia De Le all the fortune of which he had a right to dispose Let her be told adds the unhappy De S "that this must be looked on as a Brother's not a Lover's gift that Duty and Virtue forbid the Wife of the Duke of to shed one tear of Love to the Memory of the Baron De S let one wretched Victim to affection suffice  let him be forgottenMay Heaven bless her Give her great God the happiness which might have fallen to my shareadd my date of days to hers"  When this young Nobleman disappeared it was imagined from the whole tenor of his incoherent Letter addressed to several friends in different parts but directed to no one from his taking nothing of value with him and leaving even his purse in his inkstand that he left his house with an intention of putting an end to his Life And though after the most careful search his body was not found yet it was still believed that he had completed his shocking purpose  Disguised in the Habit of a Pilgrim Henry De S went to the Abbey of La Trappe in the Province of Perche in the diocese of Séez He gained admission And the Father Abbot immediately received him into the fraternity The Rules of this order are more austere than those of any other of the Romish Church Perpetual silence is enjoined to the Monks They are allowed neither to receive nor write letters None of their friends may see them so that they are totally ignorant of what passes in the World Their only food is Bread and Pulse their drink Water Meat Fish Eggs Milk Butter Wine and Oil are forbidden to themThey are not allowed to study The Bible and a very few books of severe morality and selfdenial compose the whole Library of a Monk of La Trappe They live a very  laborious Life cultivating the earth or following some manual employment such as they are found most fitted for The Father Abbot only is allowed to speak When they are in the last agonies of Life they are placed on a Bier covered with Straw and Ashes and carried into the Church They lie on this Bier till they expire and if they retain the power of speech in this last strife of Nature their Vow of Silence is dispensed with in order that they may exhort their Brethren this permission has sometimes given rise to very affecting scenes and discoveries  The uncommon severities which the young Baron De S was obliged by the Rules to practise in the Monastery of La Trappe injured his health He had sound retirement but not peace The continual agitations of his mind which converse with the friendly part of the World might have relieved disturbed his reason after he had been in this gloomy solitude two years The Monks of La Trappe dig a part of their Grave at certain stated hours Whilst employed in this occupation Henry's now weakened mind pictured the form of his onceloved mistress sinking into it This impression once made upon his imagination constantly returned at the same place and time His reason was not enough extinguished to make him suppose Eulalia really present but the picture once formed by his disordered imagination was so strong that he thought it a Vision Impressed from this Idea the coinage of his weakened reason he determined difficult and dangerous as the execution of such a  design was to escape from La Trappe as he thought that Eulalia's appearance to him indicated a want of some assistance which it might be in his power to give to her Forbidden by the Rules of his order to speak but in prayer and all the Brethren avoiding one another except at Church as much as possible the state of Henry's mind balancing between reason and madness of which he himself at times was sensible escaped observation He got away amongst a number of Pilgrims who came to La Trappe to perform some acts of devotion disguised in the very dress which he had on two years before when he entered the MonasteryHow or where he parted from the other Pilgrims is not known  After the second day's travelling in the depth of a severe Winter he was benighted on a heath he wandered there for some hours till his strength and vital heat spite of the hardships to which he was accustomed were nearly exhausted when his undirected steps brought him to the Convent of Meudon Father Hubert found him kneeling in the Portico of the Church as he came out from celebrating Midnight Mass The Benevolent Priest seeing a wayworn Pilgrim at that time of the night in such an unprotected situation invited him to his Cell After he had been refreshed there confidence in the fameknown character of Father Hubert despair and the workings of a disordered imagination joined to make him discover his wildly conceived design Father Hubert attempted to win him from his purpose of  pursuing his journey he could not find which way he was bending his course and he feared to ask him too many questions Finding common persuafion and what force he could oppose to him ineffectual to deter him from continuing his journey he feigned to suspect the real motive of it but as the test of the purity of his intentions Father Hubert offered himself to be his conductor if he would stay till the Noon of the coming day as in the Morning he was obliged by his office being Almorer and Priest to the Convent to attend and officiate in an extraordinary solemnity which was to be performed Henry accepted of his offer and somewhat calmed spent the remaining part of the night in prayer  THE MONK OF LA TRAPPE A TALE  How much is Man to pride a slave  To compass an ambitious end  Though he have godlike power to bless  He acts the persecuting Fiend  For sounding titles pompous names  That never gave one real joy  His life is past in constant cares  Which all his happiness annoy  Not only to himself severe  When fierce ambition cruel reigns  He heeds no touch from Nature's ties  Nor dovelike pity's melting strains  He harms the Friend whom he esteems  He seeks the Wretch his soul disproves  He does the deed his heart arraigns  E'en immolates the Child he loves  And shall no warning Voice prevail  Will Man but by experience learn  Experience dearbought by himself  His real interest to discern  Nofrom himself alone he learns  The Ills which from ambition flow  That all but Virtue's heavenly charms  Is Folly Vanity and Woe  Till he has tried the tortuous path  Which blindfold he is doom'd to tread  He thinks unhurt th' Ordeal to pass  And tempts the danger he should dread  When Passion blows the treacherous gale  Reason and Prudence quit their post  The Mind obeys the boisterous storm  Unshipp'd its helm its compass lost  In vain the Musee'en Heaven in vain  Point out the course it ought to steer  Their warnings are unheeded all  Till Fate allows no time to veer  Yet once again the Muse essays  Oh may her warning voice prevail  To show Ambition's fatal Ills  Her moral pointing from a tale  The Sun appear'd to set in blood  Dark gathering clouds deform'd the East  O'er the lone wild a Pilgrim rov'd  Nor saw nor hop'd a place of rest  'Twas bleak December's dreary night  Frore snow and beating hail descend  Wand'ring he roam'd nor knew which course  His weary wayworn steps to bend  Long had be trod the stiffen'd plain  Fatigued benumb'd with piercing cold  Just as his hopeless spirits droop'd  A not far distant bell was toll'd  Calm'd for a moment e'en his woes  Hush'd were his sorrows and his fears  And to the side whence the sound came  His quicken'd onward course he steers  The Bell now ceas'dA striking Clock  Proclaim'd the solemn hour of night  And now he hears sweet Music's sound  And sees a spreading glaring light  Scarcely his weak'ned eyeballs bear  To meet its dazzling welcome rays  It shows a building's large extent  A cloister'd convent's dome displays  Its lofty portico he gain'd  To shroud his tempestbeaten head  And pious kneel'd beneath its roof  Whilst midnight Mass within was said  The deep full Organ's swelling sound  Cheers his just fainting woestruck heart  Soft mournful voices raise the tears  Which from his halfclos'd eyelids start  The Service ceas'dHubert appear'd  On the smooth brow of this lov'd sage  Autumnal grace which linger'd long  Yields to the majesty of Age  Say cries the kind benignant Sire  Why at this hour thou kneelest here  Can I assistance lend to check  That heartheav'd sigh that falling tear  Thy Pilgrim's weeds thy sandal'd feet  Thy rugged poverty declare  Perhaps thou'rt houseless and forlorn  Then haste my happy Cell to share  He said and lighted to his cell  The hapless wayspent Pilgrim sigh'd  What Thanks my Father can I give  No Thanks the priestly Saint reply'd  God is the parent of us all  The child of want and woe his care  Whilst with me thou partak'st  his  gifts  Thou hast a Brother's rightful share  Then sit and eat and cheerful eat  What I with heartfelt pleasure give  Hadst thou the plenteous store I have  The helpless would from thee receive  Alas the tears which 'scape thy eye  Some deepfelt hopeless grief disclose  They seem to say "thou tend'st my wants  But can'st not heal my mental woes"  Thy uncouth garb thy Pilgrim's staff  Might cheat an undiscerning eye  Hast thou not bask'd in fortune's smile  The blushing Guest made no reply  Think not I mean t' ensnare thy youth  For young my Son I see thou art  Aught of thy secrets to disclose  Yet would I ease thy troubled heart  Th' ingenuous blush of modest worth  Glows nobly on thy downcast face  Each tender Virtue's there express'd  With simple native manly grace  The awful front of Misery  Must my respect and pity move  When shrin'd in such a form as thine  It claims a Father's care and love  Then can I stranger frankly speak  Do aught for thee beyond this hour  Thy griefs thy prospects all unknown  Tell freely tax my utmost power  Though bounded I must own that power  Not circumscrib'd is Hubert's heart  What that permits this willing does  Thy wants within its reach impart  And is this Meudon said the youth  Art thou that Sainted Hubert say  Whose pious Life has constant serv'd  To give his holy doctrines sway  Art thou that Hubert who refus'd  A Mitre's gorgeous envy'd load  Who shunn'd for Peace the path of Fame  And honour's courted thornstrow'd road  This Dome my Son is Meudon call'd  Enoughthe heartsad Pilgrim cried  Forgive me that I knew thee not  Friend of the wretch the wand'rer's guide  Kneeling the trembling Pilgrim said  Father let me thy blessing share  Though I am crimson'd o'er with sins  God will look down and hear thy prayer  O ask a blessing for a wretch  May Heaven the pious Hubert said  Forgive and bless thee hapless Son  And shower its bounties on thy head  I ask but peace the youth reply'd  And sure Heaven pointed out the way  When here it led my wand'ring steps  Far from my destin'd course astray  With thee I no concealment need  My inmost thoughts I dare disclose  The present Errour of my mind  And all my bitter unearn'd woes  Thy piercing eye pervades disguise  These weeds are not my birthright's dress  For Fortune gave me Titles Wealth  But dash'd untouch'd my cup of bliss  E'en hope is gonemy soul is dark  Some dire some unknown stroke I dread  The hand of wrath is rais'd on high  The hand of Heaven against this head  Oh why at me is aim'd the bolt  The shaken bruised broken reed  To show what God can do man bear  Must I Eternal Justice bleed  On me on me thy bolt descends  My harrass'd heart foreboding shows  'T was thus I wept 't was thus I fear'd  Before my fatal last of woes  'T was then these deathlike damps I felt  This causeless sick'ning horrour knew  Before the lov'd Eulalia sent  Her fatal tender last Adieu  Still fresh I feel the dire request  "Henry renounce forgive resign  "My hand my broken vows my heart  "For I must never now be thine  "Duty compels my Hand from thee  "But not from thee my heart is torn  "Adieu forgive the cruel act  "Thy wretched friend shall ever mourn"  Yes I forgive thy broken vows  'T was strong compulsion urg'd the deed  But thou old manMy Father's friend  Why didst thou doom my heart to bleed  What hast thou doneWhat thy reward  Forc'd us to curse our hapless fate  Say is thy fell ambition gorg'd  Thy Daughter made a Wretch in state  Mine is the pang beyond distress  Thou art her SireI curse thee not  Father I wander from my tale  And mourn with useless grief my lot  I lov'd a gentle smiling maid  Whose mind surpass'd her farfam'd charms  Her Father promis'd me her hand  Yet tore her from these faithful arms  Then joyless night enwrapt my soul  The sun ne'er rose to gild my Day  Unblest he started from the East  Or radiant shed his parting ray  Eulalia in another's arms  Was what I could not bear to see  He who could bear such prize to lose  Has never lov'd nor felt like me  I shunn'd the sight of Nuptial joys  Nor stay'd till they had seal'd my doom  Determin'd I the World forsook  And sought La Trappe's impervious gloom  Where rigid Piety resigns  A faithless World not worth its care  Here I the Habit took and Vows  Not from Religion but despair  Father thou tremblest at my Guilt  Perjur'd I am e'en at Heaven's Shrine  Perpetual silence there I vow'd  And ne'er again the world to join  But fix'd despair and frantic grief  Have tempted me to break those Vows  Will Heaven forgive the crime I've dar'd  And pardon what it disallows  Two years I've dragg'd the heavy chain  Of Life's incumbent hated load  Far from the cheerful walks of man  With nought conversing but my God  And all my order's rigid Rules  With gloomy pleasure I've observ'd  Labour and fasting midnight prayers  From silence ne'er till now I've swerv'd  Oh had I ere this fatal hour  Which brings my guilty footsteps here  In sackcloth and in ashes cloth'd  Expiring press'd the welcome bier  Then had this prison of my Soul  Been to my slowmade  The Monks of La Trappe dig every day three Spadefuls of earth from their destined graves  grave consign'd  Borne by my Brethren's pious love  As in my requiem they had join'd  Thou GraveNow Love thy only balm  My hopemy wishmy peacemy gain  Would I might plunge to thee uncall'd  Quick snatch me to thy dark domain  With terrour now the Pilgrim starts  Aghast he fix'd his eager eyes  As if some hideous form he saw  And frantic thus to Hubert cries  Father the fatal Vision's here  Mark what her trembling lips shall say  She sinksa horrid mass deform  See see she slowly melts away  She's here againin beauty beams  Oh keep that charming lovely form  She sinksto fell corruption's dross  To feed the loathsome bloated worm  Com'st thou again O speak my Love  As erst beside my slowdug grave  Say now thy Spirit waits for mine  Or what thy dreadful Visits crave  Was not my love for thee as pure  As thy own spotless heavenly mind  No other love but that of God  Glow'd in this breast where thou art shrin'd  For thee I break my heavenseal'd Vows  To search why thou disturb'st my rest  Say dost thou want to rouse the friend  Within thy Henry's faithful breast  Say if Misfortune's ruthless hand  Make me thy only chosen aid  I'll dare as much as man may dare  Protect thee if thou art betray'd  Dear lovely dreadful Vision speak  Say why thou nightly thus art seen  Tell me thy Spirit waits for mine  Or what thy fearful Visits mean  Sink not to EarthDistract me not  Rise in thy beauty to my sight  Let loveliness still round thee fling  Her radiant robe of living light  God of my Soul avert thy wrath  O shield me from this horrid sight  Let madness seize on memory's power  And shroud each sense in dunnest night  Why sink'st thou thus a shapeless mass  Thy form thus mould'ring to decay  O take me to the shades of death  Terrific vision lead the way  Prostrate the raving Pilgrim fell  The pious Hubert rais'd his head  Keeling beside his ghastly form  Whilst o'er his woes his bosom bled  I'll share thy griefs be calm my Son  Blest is that man who patient bears  His heavenappointed lot below  Affliction in this vale of tears  Take comfort then my hapless Son  Say cries the youth hast thou a charm  Can cure despair and heal my mind  My memory of its sting disarm  If not what comfort canst thou give  All other aid but that were vain  Would'st with a breath control the waves  Or strive the raging winds to chain  Think'st thou unbuffeted this storm  Has lawless rul'd without control  Or unresisting I obey'd  This blackest tempest of the Soul  O'er the sick mind what balm has power  Within art's ample healing bound  I seek a cure may haply prove  A scorpion's venom to my wound  Thou know'st our Order's rigid rules  No converse with the world's allow'd  But I must know the fate of her  To whom my early faith was vow'd  Her seen That known my mind will calm  Nor more with visions be oppress'd  I'll expiate then my perjur'd Vows  And patient wait eternal rest  Father adieu betray me not  Full many a league I've yet to stray  These pilgrim's weeds disguis'd me once  As to La Trappe I steer'd my way  Beneath this humble friendly garb  I'll view unseen the form I love  Return and expiate my offence  And from my soul this load remove  Forbear to tempt this wintry gloom  O dread the dangers of the way  The Father said know thou'rt proscrib'd  Thy wildness will thy crime betray  Renounce my Son thy dang'rous plan  Ne'er but with life the Youth reply'd  Let me but live to see her once  Then Parent Earth my sorrows hide  Constrain me not forego thy grasp  What can avail thy feeble age  'Gainst Youth in all its prime of strength  Nerv'd by athletic frantic rage  Oh stay me notunloose thy hold  O venerable Sire forbear  Oh force me not to break thy grasp  Dread to contend with fix'd despair  What canst thou 'gainst my youthful arm  I venerate thy hoary hairs  Yet not their sacred prevalence  Nor e'en thy trembling starting tears  Can win my Soul to change its course  No Lion's force not temper'd steel  Should bind me hereYet bless me Sire  Forgive the guilt thou ne'er canst feel  Alas my Son an instant stay  No longer shall my arm contend  I'll not detain by force or fraud  But hear the counsel of a friend  Just Heaven direct my troubled thoughts  Instruct me what I ought to do  How soothe this hapless wretched youth  Yet keep my Duty still in view  My Soul disdains the traitor's part  Thy secret trusted to my breast  There lock'd my Son shall still repose  Whilst thought and memory shall rest  Stay till tomorrow's noon be past  Be rul'd and in thy friend confide  Then will I share th' adventurous toil  Thy wandering mind thy footsteps guide  Soon as the Sun shall gild the East  An awful Rite demands my care  As Priest help thou to sing the Mass  Claim in that Sacrifice thy share  If all thy purpose be to see  The form thou ought'st not now to love  To calm thy mind and ease thy fears  My offer'd aid thou wilt approve  Perhaps beyond stern Duty's rules  Prescrib'd protecting thee I go  But man should err on mercy's side  And stem not aid the storm of woe  A mind like thine indulgence wants  Yet better Son thy plan delay  May I not urge thee to return  And to La Trappe retrace thy way  No morewith warmth the Pilgrim cried  A Prophet's eloquence would fail  When yawning gulphs beneath my feet  Nor Heaven's fear'd wrath could aught avail  Think'st thou thy voice can more than these  Bid the fix'd stars in orbits roll  Bid ocean's waves obey thy laws  And hurl them foaming to the Pole  Do thisthen hope the Mind to rule  The stricken Mind of freeborn Man  Which like the Comets' lawless blaze  Though all unequal has its plan  Distract me notthe woestung mind  Too near approaches to that height  Whence Reason roaming bursts all bounds  And joins with madness in her flight  Urge me no moreIn mercy cease  Father I never will return  Till I have seen the form I love  Or clasp'd these arms around her Urn  Force or mean fraud thou wilt not use  I dare in Hubert's promise trust  Thy hoary hairs thy sacred fame  Vouch that thou canst not be unjust  Glad I accept thee as my Guide  Thy welcome presence shall supply  The real presence of my God  As His I'll fear thy piercing Eye  Heaven knows my heart its frailties knows  It errs from woe not wilful Sin  Scan thou its movements thou art just  And aid the monitor within  I thank thee Father for thy care  Be the companion of my way  I'll wait the mornMy Duty calls  To prayer Let me its voice obey  Trembling he kneel'd"Great God he cried  "Omniscient allpervading mind  "Upon a prostrate sinful worm  "Look from that Heaven where thou art shrin'd  "Not in avenging terrours rob'd  "Thy Sword of Justice rais'd on high  "But clad in Mercy's mildest beam  "Thee let my trembling soul descry  "Else dare I not my prayer prefer  "Wert thou but terrible and

frantic and disorder'd haste  The Pilgrim said his wonted prayers  The midnight office of La Trappe  With agonizing sighs and tears  The pious Hubert watch'd his Guest  And view'd the workings of his soul  Wish'd to relieve his anguish'd mind  Yet fear'd the storm he would control  In meditation and in prayer  The young Monk spent night's livelong hours  His ruffled harrass'd mind seem'd sooth'd  And show'd Religion's healing powers  The Morning breaks dark gloomy sad  And in the East no Sun appears  Hail rain and snow deform the Sky  Each leafless tree is dropping tears  A tolling bell to early Mass  Now call'd the pious hallow'd Priest  Prostrate he kiss'd the Altar's base  Attended by his sorrowing Guest  Each said his Mass and then retir'd  Fasting to meditate and pray  Compos'd the stranger Guest appear'd  Yet could not prayer his gloom allay  As in the Sacristy they kneel'd  Hubert sad Anselm  In the Roman Church when either a Man or Woman enters into a Monastic Order they are called by the name of some Saint not by their Christian or Family Name  thus address'd  "Canst thou assist in the next Mass  "Or is thy soul too much distress'd  "Cuthbertha then those vows will make  "Which nought on earth can e'er erase  "Wilt thou her written Vows receive  "And place them on the Altar's base  "Whilst I the Benediction give  "And join the sainted virgin choir  "To celebrate the sacrifice  "Which zeal and piety inspire"  The Stranger willing bow'd assent  The deepton'd bell proclaim'd the hour  In Priestly vestments at the Shrine  Again their orisons they pour  The Curtain drawn before the Grate  Conceal'd the Sainted Vestal band  Now drawn aside the Virgin Choir  In order round the Novice stand  Cover'd with cloth of blackest hue  An Altar in the midst was rear'd  Th' intended victim kneeling there  In sable flowing robes appear'd  A Veil of lawn of purest white  Which swept with graceful folds the ground  Around her face and shoulders spread  A Crown of Thorns her temples bound  Emblem of all that's fair and good  Shone Modesty upon her brow  And with a blush her cheek suffus'd  More deep than beauty's transient glow  Yet hers was beauty's choicest form  Approaching almost to divine  That but for some slowfalling tears  She seem'd an Angel at the Shrine  Trembling with tears her soft blue eyes  Shone like the moon before the storm  Now bright now darken'd by the mist  As gathering clouds the sky deform  The Organ's solemn descant flow'd  With eager gaze she seeks the skies  Then kiss'd with pious awe the cross  Whilst heavenly rapture fill'd her eyes  Th' expecting crowd gaz'd on the maid  A sigh was heav'd from every breast  At sight of the sweet Victim's charms  For whom the sacred shrine was dress'd  For beauty melts the fiercest heart  Subdues the sternest firmest mind  But victim beauty claims the sigh  Of love and tender sorrow join'd  She rose her gentle bosom heav'd  The Lilly oft usurp'd her cheek  As to the curtain'd Grate she walk'd  With downcast eyes mild modest meek  Her folded hands her downcast eyes  The sigh by piety repress'd  Spoke resignation to her Fate  But Comfort alien to her breast  Close to the Altar's foot she kneel'd  With trem'lous voice her Vows she made  Vowswhich engag'd to quit the world  For ever for the Cloister's shade  Anselm approach'd to take the Scroll  And place it on the Altar's base  His gloomy groundfix'd eye now view'd  For the first time Cuthbertha's face  Forgetful of the place the time  Cuthbertha Henry's name exclaim'd  The Parchment scap'd his trembling hand  Anselm the lov'd Eulalia nam'd  "O faithful found what joy in grief  "Lift up again thy dovelike eyes  "O God of wrath eternal bars  "'Gainst our once guiltless union rise  Th' affrighted Hubert seiz'd his arm  "O know my Son he whispering said  "Thy words are doubly impious here  "God's on the Shrine his vengeance dread  "Go seek my Cell and hide thee there"  "No" cried the awestruck wretched youth  "The winged shaft of death is sped  "Let my last look behold her Truth  "Approach and bless the trembling saint  "Thy sacred office now pursue  "Grant this my last request in life  "Let my dimm'd eyes love's victim view"  An awful silence now ensued  Pale terrour in each face appears  It reign'd a momentand was chac'd  By one loud burst of groans and tears  Grief found a universal voice  For woes beyond the reach of cure  All pity'd lov'd and mourn'd the pair  Call'd such stern trial to endure  Hubert drew near the beauteous Nun  The holy Benediction gave  Her halfclos'd eyes to Heaven were rais'd  She seem'd some earnest wish to crave  With trembling haste Cuthbertha rose  Her charming eyes had lost their fire  Dreadfully calm she gaz'd around  As slow she totter'd down the Choir  There on her knees her requiem sung  Then prostrate kiss'd the hallow'd ground  A Pall secluded her from view  Whilst all the Sisters chaunted round  Thrice round the emblematic Pall  The Abbess shook the holy Dew  And thrice with graceful welltaught hand  The smoking incense circling threw  The Vestal band the Office sung  Whilst 'neath the Pall Cuthbertha lies  The Ritual done the Pall romov'd  "  Sester  " the Abbess said "  arise  "  Cuthbertha heeded not the voice  The trembling Nuns around her drew  They raise her languid charming form  And Death in every feature view  Each art which stackning life recalls  With eager wellmeant haste they try  She strives for speech but 't is in vain  Her quivering lips their aid deny  Again she strove and rais'd her eyes  Her outstretch'd hands together press'd  Then like a tempestbeaten flower  Sunkne'er to riseon Helen's breast  Despair and Horrour in his look  Anselm on his Cuthbertha gaz'd  Distracted saw that Death's stern hand  The beauteous edifice had raz'd  And as they bore her corpse away  His fix'd eye spoke that poignant woe  Which words or tears can ne'er express  Souls pierc'd like his can only know  Falling at Hubert's feet he said  "Let the Grave joinOur vows are past"  This effort his affection made  But it was dying Nature's last  The boon the hapless Henry ask'd  To the sad pair the Sisters gave  In Death they had fulfill'd their Vows  Which reach'd no further than the Grave  Ye Fair ye Young ye Gay ye Vain  This tale O not unsoften'd hear  These hapless Lovers claim one sigh  Their woes but not their Death a Tear  One tear of Sorrow e'en from hearts  Adversity has never taught  And soften'd in her rugged School  And bade to taste her wholesome draught  Within that Heart which views unmov'd  All other griefs except its own  Friendship shall never find a place  Nor Virtue e'er erect her throne  What though no woes assail ye now  No anguish no corroding care  Was not Eulalia happy once  The fairest too where all were fair  Till Henry was deny'd her love  And secret left his lordly seat  She ne'er had tasted sorrow's pang  But then her misery rose complete  Her gentle bosom knew no peace  Nought now could ease its throbbing pain  The faithful muchlov'd Henry lost  Her Sire relented now in vain  A burning fever fir'd her blood  Insatiate Death watch'd for his prey  Though Youth repell'd his eager grasp  'T was only for a short delay  Th' ambitious Sire his folly curs'd  His Daughter fading in her bloom  The duteous Victim to his pride  Slow sinking to an early Tomb  Him moping melancholy seiz'd  With mind distraught that knows no rest  The thought that he had kill'd his Child  For ever haunts his cruel breast  Hopeless a Cloister'd life she chose  Far from those scenes which Love had known  Where hours now pass'd with leaden pace  Which once with swiftest wing had flown  She fear'd that Henry's frantic mind  Had rais'd his hand against his life  And rashly plung'd in endless woe  From passion's fell conflicting strife  To weep and pray for him she lov'd  To God she dedicates her hours  Her sighs her unseen tears were his  And his the Orisons she pours  The Nuns of Meudon at her Death  First learn'd the reason of her Grief  Unseen the mourner lov'd to weep  Nor would be thought to want relief  Think not ye Fair ye are secure  Though happy now from grief and care  The woes I sing ye ne'er may know  But others fall to Mortals' share  If Virtue in your bosoms glow  If Pity there her Altar rear  The Sympathy these woes excite  Shall teach to stem some falling Tear  To be the hand of Providence  Its Angel ministring below  Dispenser thou the Donor God  Who giving gives thee to bestow  Then not unuseful has the Muse  From Meudon's annals sketch'd this Tale  Of Henry's woes Eulalia's love  And snatch'd it from oblivion's vale    ODE to YOUTH  SWEET Morn of Life All hail ye hours of ease  When blooms the cheek with roseate varying dyes  When modest grace exerts each power to please  And streaming lustre radiates in the eyes  Thy past hours innocent thy present gay  Thy future halcyon Hope depicts without allay  Dayspring of Life oh stay thy fleeting hours  Thou fairyreign of ev'ry pleasant thought  Fancy to cheer thy path strews all her flowers  And in her loom thy plan of years is wrought  By thee for goodness is each heart caress'd  The World untried is judg'd by that within thy breast  Sweet state of Youth O harmony of Soul  Now cheerful dawns the day noon brightly beams  And evening comes serene nor cares control  And night approaches with soft infant dreams  Circling the morn beholds th' accustom'd round  Life's smiling charities awake and joys abound  Season of hope and peace and virtues stay  And for our bliss let inexperience rest  For what can prudent foresight's beam display  Whythe barb'd arrow pointed at our breast  Teach to suspect the heart we guileless trust  And ere we are betray'd to think a friend unjust  Thou candid Age with ardent Friendship fraught  That fearless confidence to none denies  Better sometimes deceiv'dand artless taught  By thy own griefs the wisdom of the wise  For sad Experience with sorrowing breath  Sheds weeping sheds the pristine roses in Hope's wrcath  Season belov'd Ah doom'd to pass away  With all thy freshness all thy flatt'ring joys  With blooming Beauty's envy'd powerful sway  With laughing hours the future ne'er annoys  Ah be thou spent as Virtue bids to spend  Thenthough we wish thy stayno sighs thy reign shall end    IMITATION OF THE FRENCH HYMN Quoted in the Spectator No  GREAT God thy judgments all are just  With strictest Equity combin'd  Though in thy sight I am but dust  Thou still delightest to be kind  But I am crimson'd o'er with sin  Have trespass'd on thy suffering Grace  Which gave my Soul that light within  Might guide me to behold thy Face  I've sinn'd and from thy Wrath would flee  What City shall be refuge found  For should thy Goodness pardon me  'T will thy Eternal Justice wound  My Sins bereave my Soul of hope  To hear O God thy pardoning Voice  In thy dread power they nought have left  But of my Punishment the choice  Thy Golden Sceptre who rejects  An Iron Rod shall find to bruise  Thy Clemency my doom expects  Nor to avert thy Justice sues  If Lord thy Glory it promote  Thy fearful Wrath must yet impend  My wounded Soul must still be smote  My Tears and contrite Groans offend  In sinning against Thee I warr'd  Avenge Thyself display thy Power  StrikeBut whilst perishingO Lord  My Soul though trembling shall adore  Exhaust the Phial of thy Wrath  My countless Sins deserve it all  Yet can thy Justice pour it forth  Or can thy dreadful Thunder fall  On any placeEarth Air or Flood  Where canst thou lift 'gainst me thy Rod  Which is not sprinkled with Christ's Blood  The Blood of an atoning God  ODE TO ADVERSITY INSCRIBED TO MISS H  THOU Touchstone of the human soul  Of Virtue the stern awful Test  Whose fierce terrific high control  Subdues the loftiest plumed Crest  And makes the meekest heart repine  The Thunder scaths the Mountain Pine  It blasts the foliage of the Dale  Nor turns aside to spare the Lilly of the Vale  Against Thee where's the Panoply  Impregnable to Thee what Place  Nor Cots too low nor Thrones too high  O'er all thy Ravages we trace  One only Champion has the force  To stand erect against thy course  Arm'd with invulnerable shield  Exalted Fortitudethou ne'er subdu'dst to yield  Ah ruthless Power dare I complain  That against me thy shafts are sped  Whilst peace whilst selfcontent remain  Nor hopes of Happiness are fled  Like Sickness thou art hard to bear  But real Friends come round to cheer  Kindness can soothe the Throb of Pain  When Gilead's Balm shall fail and Opiates are in vain  Yet when thy Storms are hovering near  FALSE FRIENDS to drop the mask presume  As Blossoms fall ne'er meant to bear  Fair but deceitful steril Bloom  But yet of Friends how few pass'd by  Averting their stern alter'd eye  How many faithful gathering round  Pour'd Oil and Wine to cheer and bound up ev'ry Wound  For hearts there are where still presides  Virtue in all her health sublime  Where ev'ry Duty fix'd resides  Proof against Fortune's wreck or Time  For native worth from selfish pride  The winnowing Storm will sure divide  As the light Chaff along the plain  Flies devious far away and leaves the golden grain  When first the Storm burst o'er my head  You Anna never kept aloof  Such kindness through your heart is shed  Your Friendship has been Tempest Proof  For fraught with Candour Sweetness Truth  In the gay Prime of smiling Youth  When Pleasures on each hour attend  Me then you generous sought your chosen earliest Friend  Your kind attention pours a balm  O'er troubles which my Soul must bear  Consol'd by you it feels a calm  You lessen Griefs you deign to share  The noble Virtues of your mind  With all the social Graces join'd  Distinguish what you owe your birth  And in my Anna shines her Father's genuine worth  Pity full oft is Sympathy  When we ourselves have felt like woe  Unwounded by Adversity  You heal the ills you ne'er can know  This is that Virtue those attain  Whose happy Fate is free from pain  'T is Godlike others Griefs to share  For Mortals Angels feel themselves exempt from Care    March    TO MISS BRAND  MARY our Prayer being still the same  A little Litany I frame  The Wish that dwells within each breast  So early form'd so oft express'd  Is by the Muse's favouring care  At length reduc'd to Form of Prayer  Sisters who're Friends like you and me  Perhaps will join our Litany  Whilst those whose hearts know no such love  Will from our Mode Dissenters prove  PRAYER TO THE PARCAE  Inexorable Triad tell us where  In what vast Antre or what Cypress grove  Your gloomy Altars trembling Mortals rear  And what the hallow'd Sacrifice ye love  If ever your stern breasts relent at tears  If ye have hearts that sighs can comprehend  If ye can sympathize in human cares  Propitious to our humble suit attend  Two Sisters are we who in life's rough way  Full early enter'd 'neath a baneful Star  Together though unbless'd with one bright ray  We bear the hardships of its constant war  Companions still the same our hopes and woes  Sweet counsel seek we in each other's mind  And the soft green where harrass'd souls repose  Each finds within her Sister's bosom shrin'd  No dearer Friendship and no separate Joy  Has e'er estrang'd us from each other's heart  No Strife has ever mingled its alloy  In Good or Ill each had a Sister's part  Together we retrace our sorrows past  With that sweet interest only Sisters feel  Hope's bright'ning beam upon the future cast  Or present Ills participating heal  Such ye stern Parcae are your Suppliants now  Seeking Protection from one dreaded Ill  We ask not Wealth nor Honours for our brow  Unmurmuring have we liv'd without them still  Nor do we ask exemption from all Grief  Patient we bow to an o'erwhelming share  There is but Onefor which there's no relief  But Onewe have not Fortitude to bear  If erring Mortals ignorant and blind  May sinless deprecate the Grief they fear  Be our petition in your memory shrin'd  Respect the sacred prevalence of prayer  CLOTHO thy Distaff at thy pleasure fill  E'en though the flax with rugged knots be cross'd  LACHESIS draw our Threads together still  We heed not whether long or short thou draw'st  When to their length th' appointed Threads are spun  Them to the fatal Shears together guide  Swiftly O ATROPOS thy task be done  THE SISTER THREADS AT THE SAME STROKE DIVIDE    March    FINIS
