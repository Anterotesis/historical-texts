 A SERMON Preach'd at QueenStreet Chapel AND St Paul's CoventGarden On FRIDAY the th of  February  Being the Day appointed for a General fast  By the Rev THOMAS FRANCKLIN M A  Publish'd at the Desire of those who heard it  LONDON Printed for R FRANCKLIN in  Russelstreet CoventGarden    Price SIXPENCE  JONAH c v  Let neither Man nor Beast Herd nor Flock taste any Thing let them not feed nor drink Water  But let Man and Beast be covered with Sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn every one from his evil Way  THE perpetual superintendency of Divine Providence in the government of the Universe and Direction of natural▪ Causes towards the Encouragement of good and the Punishment of evil Doers are Truths which none but the Impious and Prophane have ever dared to call in Question The Powers and Qualities of all created Beings are render'd subservient to the Design and Purpose of him who made them and become the Instrument of his Favour or Displeasure towards the Sons of Men  IN the common and ordinary Course of Things we do not indeed so visibly discern this great and universal Spring which actuates every Motion In the Conduct and Fate of Individuals therefore the Interposition of the Almighty doth too frequently escape our Notice  and Observation but when his Hand is stretch'd out over the Nations of the Earth when Millions feel his Wrath and Kingdoms bow down before him when his signal Judgments affright and his Terrors dismay us when the Angel of Destruction is commission'd by him to punish offending Multitudes and call Sinners to Repentance when Sword Pestilence and Famine Snow and Hail Storm and Tempest fulfill his Word then doth Mankind awaken from it's Lethargy of Sin and Ignorance and discover the immediate Agency and Interposition of the Divine Being then is the Sentence of an angry God legible to every Eye written as it were in Characters of Fire and pointing out the Finger of the Almighty  IF we turn over the instructive Pages of Holy Writ we shall find this perpetual governing Providence explain'd by incontestible Evidence and illustrated by the most signal Examples  AND amongst them all there is not perhaps one wherein the Power the Justice and the Goodness of God are more immediately visible than in that which is recorded in the third Chapter of the Book of the Prophet  Jonah  THE  City of  Nineveh says the Prophet  was an exceeding great City  probably as eminently superior to Others in the Wickedness as in the Number of it's Inhabitants a profligate and abandon'd Race of Men who went on from Folly to Folly and from Sin to Sin till they had exhausted the Patience and Longsuffering of an offended God and fill'd up the Measure of their Iniquity till at length the Lord sent unto them his faithful Prophet the Messenger of sad and heavy Tidings  to denounce unto them their immediate Destruction and  Jonah  cried and said  yet forty Days and  Nineveh  shall be overthrown  A Sentence so dreadful and so unexpected was received we may imagine with an equal Degree of Terror and Astonishment they beheld themselves in a Moment on the Brink of Ruin the Stroke was certain the Fate was unavoidable  THE Truth of what was foretold would admit of no Doubt or Disputation the Authority of the Person who deliver'd the Prophecy the Preciseness of the Time affix'd for it's Accomplishment the Consciousness of their own Guilt all conspired to persuade them that their Destruction was nigh at Hand their Fears were alarm'd their Souls awaken'd their Hearts melted by the approaching Danger what therefore could be done on so solemn so melancholy an Occasion Omnipotence was not to be resisted nor Omniscience to be deceived they could only humble themselves before the Lord implore Pardon and Forgiveness and throw themselves on his Mercy  Who can tell  said they  if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce Anger that we perish not So the People of  Nineveh  believed God and proclaimed a Fast and put on Sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least  THE Sovereign of this distressed Nation is described to us by the Prophet as exactly resembling our own solicitous for the Welfare feeling for the Calamities anxious for the Reformation of his afflicted People he recommends to them in the most pressing Manner the strict and religious Observance of the Fast and enforces it by his own Royal Example  HE  arose from his Throne and laid his Robe from him and covered him with Sackcloth and sat in Ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through  Nineveh  by the Decree of the King and his Nobles saying  LET  neither Man nor Beast Herd nor Flock taste any Thing let them not feed nor drink Water  BUT  let Man and Beast be covered with Sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn every one from his evil Way  NO sooner was this solemn Decree pronounced but it was universally complied with they fasted prayed and repented they lamented their Sins wept for their Iniquities and turned unto the Lord their God  AND now let us carefully observe the Consequence of their Conduct and Behaviour the Effect was prosperous far beyond all which their most sanguine hopes could promise them  GOD  whose Mercy is over all his Works and who hateth nothing that he has made  took Compassion on them he beheld their sorrow and Contrition and would not that it should pass unobserved or unrewarded  he saw their Works  says the Prophet  that they turned from their evil Way and God repented of the Evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not  SUCH an Instance of gracious Condescension and unspeakable Mercy cannot but affect our Minds with the strongest Sense of Gratitude and afford Matter of Comfort and Consolation to a sinful and afflicted People  IT is indeed an Example which if duly attended to by us on this solemn Occasion may be an useful Monitor and serve in this Hour of Peril to direct our Ways and to guide our Footsteps aright  LET us then seriously consider and reflect on the Example before us and as we but too nearly resemble the People of  Nineveh  in the Multitude of our Sins let us endeavour to imitate them in our Repentance also and to this End let us lay before ourselves the Means which they pursued and the Methods which they made use of to bring on this salutary Effect  AND first then it appears by the History of the  Ninevites  as recorded in holy Writ that the Duty of Fasting was always highly acceptable unto God and that therefore it will most probably always continue to be so  FASTING is a Duty indeed which though it had not the Sanction of the Almighty to recommend or his Authority to enforce it would by the common Rules of Prudence and Discretion lay Claim to our frequent Practice and Observation of it Even when she is not employ'd in the solemn Offices of Religion to assist Repentance and raise Devotion she may still be considered as the Hand▪maid of Temperance the Companion of Health and the Counsellor of Virtue  THE most poignant of human Pleasures will cloy without some Pause and satiate without some intermission Abstinence therefore is necessary to enhance the Value of every Blessing and give a Relish to every Enjoyment  BUT if this Virtue is useful in the common Course of our Affairs it becometh an Act still more solemn and  important when it is made use of to avert the Judgments of God and turn aside his Indignation from us  WE have seen the great and glorious Effect which it produced in the Case of  Nineveh  to the same End and for the same Purposes was it appointed on this Day and may the God of Patience and longsuffering assist us with the same Portion of his divine Favour and reward us also in like Manner for our Observance of it  LET us then my Brethren  not taste any Thing neither feed nor drink Water  but let us with the People of  Nineveh cover ourselves with Sackcloth and turn every one from his evil Way  THE Pulpit is not ought not certainly to be the Seat of Politics or the Field for national and public Affairs but here Occasion warrants and Necessity demands it of us  WE are call'd upon this Day by the Voice of public Authority to cry aloud and forbidden to spare to echo the Voice of our Rulers and lament the Crimes and Calamities of our Country to say that from a brave a virtuous and a successful we are now grown a sinful weak and unhappy People  We are become  as the Psalmist says  an open Shame to our Enemies the very Scorn and Derision of all those that are round about us  Is it not my Brethren a melancholy Consideration to see a Land of Plenty like this reduced to a State of Penury and Famine a Land of Honour and Virtue changed into a Land of Folly and Corruption a Land of Freemen into a Land of Slaves a Land of Christians into a Land of Pagans Deists and Freethinkers  THERE was a Time when private Virtue supported public Welfare and Prosperity when the Peace and  Safety of Society was ensured by the Prudence and Piety of every Individual There were once such things as Patriotism Sincerity and Integrity amongst us Our Ancestors sacrificed every thing to the Love of our Country whilst we sacrifice the Love of our Country to every thing else Fashion in short hath deluded Luxury hath enervated Pleasure hath enchanted us  THE slow and secret Poison of Corruption hath insinuated itself into every Vein inffused a Listlesness and languor over the whole Frame undermined and prey'd upon the Constitution We remain supine and inactive and even whilst Misery is pouring in upon us seem utterly insensible of it We lull our Senses to Oblivion in the Arms of Indolence and at the same Time fondly imagine ourselves reposing on the Bosom of Security  THIS my Brethren is not Declamation but Fact it is not the malignant Suggestion of Calumny and Satire but the serious melancholy Reflection of Experience and Truth  IF the  Ninevites  had not been great and miserable Sinners the solemn Denunciation of the Prophet  Jonas  would not have fallen upon them and if we also had not offended the Lord of Heaven and Earth he would not have sent down his heavy Judgments upon us To bring this Matter home then to our own Breasts and the present solemn Occasion the Angel of Destruction is gone forth the Sword of War is unsheathed and the Arrows of the Almighty are sharpened against us A great and powerful Enemy threatens us from abroad our own Sins and Wickedness oppress and weigh us down at Home  LET me then ask you a few serious and important Questions is this a Time to spread the Table of Luxury or to wanton in the Gardens of Pleasure Is it a Time to revel in the Feast of Sensuality whilst thousands are starving around us or to sound the Instruments of Joy and Festivity amidst the Groans of War and the Shrieks of public Calamity Shall the Mourner for his Country and such we ought all to be put on his gorgeous apparel and appear at the Funeral of his fellowCitizens in the Wedding Garment Is there yet amongst us a Head so void of Understanding as not to perceive our wretched Situation Is there a Heart so callous and insensible as not to feel for and sympathize with our bleeding Country Shall we then pollute our last Moments with Sin and expire in the Arms of Riot and Debauchery  REMEMBER the People of  Nineveh  they were grievous Sinners like ourselves but they fasted repented and were forgiven As we have been guilty of their Sins we have reason to fear the Judgment denounced against them but if we imitate their Example in our Reformation we may still hope for their Pardon and look for their Reward  LET us then consider this Day's Solemnity as the Foundation on which we are to build the Structure of our future happiness as the Time appointed to sow the Seeds of our Repentance which with due Care and Culture may take Root and shoot forth hereafter into a rich and plenteous Harvest Let us consider this Day's Abstinence as only an Emblem or Type of that total that far more necessary Abstinence from Sin and Wickedness which we all purpose henceforth religiously to observe  Let us keep the Fast not with the Leaven of  Malice and Sin but with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth  LET me address you then as FellowCreatures FellowCitizens and FellowSubjects By the decay of public Virtue one Link of the great Chain of Perfection is lost which hath loosen'd the whole let us strive to restore and reunite it It may be said indeed and perhaps with some truth that we still keep up the Appearance of Religion and Virtue that the Places of public Worship are still not only open but frequently and the Congregation now before me is a Confirmation of it resorted to and even crouded but let us not therefore because we can deceive others deceive ourselves also It is not merely the assembling ourselves together in the House of the Lord Fasting or  appearing unto Men to fast  which will recommend us to his divine Favour unless we observe his Laws and obey his Commandments For if the Moment we return to our own Homes we return also to all the Vices and all the Follies that we left behind us what is our short Attendance on the Almighty but a solemn Mockery of his Power and an impious Distrust of his Omniscience  WE have all been accessary to the Guilt of our Country should we not then contribute to her Repentance and Reformation also National Iniquity must bring on national Ruin and in that Ruin must we all be involved if we are not careful to prevent it If then we would save let us help ourselves let us remember that the  worst of Foes  when they are Foes  are those of our own Houshold  The Traitor within must conspire with the Enemy without before we can be entirely lost  England  whenever she falls must fall by her own Hand and to the Guilt of Murther must add the Crime of Suicide also  THE late extraordinary and unparallel'd Success of our noble Friend and Ally is a recent and a striking Instance to convince us how much the Virtue the Conduct the Example of one Man may influence the Actions and rule the Fate of thousands His Arms were crown'd with Conquest and we it is to be hoped shall in some Measure reap the Fruits of it But should it not chastise our Joy and lessen our Exultation to reflect that this Nation should thus borrow that Fame which she used to bestow and stand indebted to foreign Courage for what she had a Right to expect from domestic Virtue Is  Britain  at last so poor in Valour as to depend upon another's Arms for her Safety another's Bravery for her Defence another's Victory for her Triumphs  LET us for Shame my Fellowcountrymen at length see and think and act for ourselves If we have that Reverence for our Country and that Regard for our Sovereign which we all profess let Religion be our Patriotism if we are ambitious to be thought good Subjects let us endeavour to be good Christians let us shew our Loyalty by our Lives and our Obedience by our Virtue Let every Man be persuaded that the Welfare the Safety and the Preservation of these Kingdoms depends on his own Conduct and Behaviour We cannot all of us take the Field and bear the Sword in the Service of our King but we may all gird on us the Sword of Truth and defend him with the Buckler of Righteousness Virtue would add fresh Strength to every Arm and Sharpness to every Sword Innocence would give us Courage Integrity would make us brave and if the Enemy could once find us uncorrupted they would soon prove us to be unconquerable As by our Follies and our Crimes we have brought on Danger and  Difficulty so may we remove them by Goodness and Reformation and insure Success and Victory abroad by Penitence and Piety at Home  BUT farther every Man has some Friends who love and esteem him some who are guided by his Example and led by his Direction every one has some Power and some Influence over others let that Power be exerted let that Influence be diffused that so the generous Flame may catch from Breast to Breast spread itself through every Limb and animate the whole reformed pardoned happy Nation  BUT lastly let us remember what that Fast is which the Lord hath chosen not only  to loose the Bonds of Wickedness but to loose the heavy Burthens and let the oppressed go free to deal our Bread to the hungry and relieve the afflicted Soul  A LITTLE a very little will suffice to satisfy Nature if it were not so how few in these cruel Days would be able to survive What therefore we may spare from our own Superfluities let us bestow on the Necessity of others what we save by fasting let us give in Charity thus shall we at the same Time preserve ourselves innocent and make our Fellowcreatures happy  cease to do Evil and learn to do Good  WE all feel the Necessity of the Times and all complain of it If even the Rich lament it in the Bosom of Affluence how must the Poor and Destitute who shiver in the cold Regions of Adversity and Affliction alas what is our Want to their Penury our Difficulty to their Despair The Storm which we only dread at a Distance is even now pouring on their Heads shall we not then afford them a little Relief a little Shelter from it  To conclude then let us all heartily and speedily set about a general Reformation from this Day of solemn Humiliation let us count our Righteousness from this auspicious Aera let us date our Virtue let it be recorded in the Annals of our Nation that this Year open'd the Eyes of an offending People and reconciled them to their God saved them from his just Judgment recommended them to his Pardon and restored them to his divine Favour and Protection that he took them once more under the Shadow of his Wings saved his repenting Nation  fed them and set them up for ever preserved them from Trouble and compassed them about with Songs of Deliverance that the Lord gave Strength unto his People and gave his People the Blessing of Peace  PERMIT me to hope then my Brethren that you will heartily and sincerely join with me in this necessary and humble Supplication  ALmighty and everliving God thou great and inexhaustible Fountain of Good and Happiness in whose Hand are all the Corners of the Earth on whose Aid we must depend for our Support on whose Bounty we must rely for Succour and to whose Mercy we must sue for Pardon accept the Prayers of thy penitent People behold O Lord we acknowledge our Faults our Transgressions are multiplied before thee and our Sins testify against us but thy Hand O Lord is not shortened that it cannot save neither thine Ear heavy that it cannot hear hear then O Lord and save let this Day's Humiliation be accepted as an Earnest of our future Repentance and this Day's Acknowledgment of our Sins plead with thee for Pardon of our past Iniquities Turn away thy Wrath and be not angry with us for ever  Return we beseech thee O God of Hosts look down from Heaven and behold what only thou canst behold the Heart of the repentant Sinner Spare us thou God of Mercy assist us thou God of Power prosper us thou God of Victory suffer not our Follies to sink or our Iniquities to overwhelm us go forth we beseech thee in this Hour of Peril with our Fleets and Armies strengthen the Hands of our gracious Sovereign preside over his Councils and direct his Ways sheath O Lord the Sword of Battle that is drawn forth against us take off from this afflicted Nation the bloody Garment of War and put upon us the Robe of Peace that by the Providence of thy Goodness every Evil dispersed and every Enemy subdued we thy repentant Servants being hurt by no Persecutions may serve and please thee in Newness of Life praising and giving Thanks unto thee in thy holy Church through Jesus Christ our Lord  FINIS
