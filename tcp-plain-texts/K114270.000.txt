 PERSIAN  ECLOGUES Written originally for the ENTERTAINMENT OF THE Ladies of  TAURIS  And now first translated  c  Quod si non h√¨c tantas fructus ostenderetur si ex his studiis delectatis sola peteretur tamen ut opinor hanc animi remissionein humanissimam ac liberalissimam judicaretis  CIC pro Arch Poeta  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  Price Sixpence  THE PREFACE  IT is with the Writings of Mankind in some Measure as with their Complexions or their Dress each Nation hath a Peculiarity in all these to distinguish it from the rest of the World  The Gravity of the  Spaniard  and the Levity of the  Frenchman  are as evident in all their Productions as in their Persons themselves and the Stile of my Countrymen is as naturally Strong and Nervous as that of an  Arabian  or  Persian  is rich and figurative  There is an Elegancy and Wildness of Thought which recommends all their Compositions and our Genius's are as much too cold for the Entertainment of such Sentiments as our Climate is for their Fruits and Spices If any of these Beauties are to be found in the following  Eclogues  I hope my Reader will consider them as an Argument of their being Original I received them at the Hands of a Merchant who had made it his Business to enrich himself  with the Learning as well as the Silks and Carpets of the  Persians  The little Information I could gather concerning their Author was That his Name was  Mahamed  and that he was a Native of  Tauris  It was in that City that he died of a Distemper fatal in those Parts whilst he was engag'd in celebrating the Victories of his favourite Monarch  the Great Abbas  As to the  Eclogues  themselves they give a very just View of the Miseries and Inconveniencies as well as the Felicities that attend one of the finest Countries in the East  The Time of the Writing them was probably in the Beginning of  Sha Sultan Hosseyn  's Reign the Successor of  Sefi  or  Solyman  the Second  Whatever Defects as I doubt not there will be many fall under the Reader's Observation I hope his Candour will incline him to make the following Reflections  That the Works of  Orientals  contain many Peculiarities and that thro' Defect of Language few  European  Translators can do them Justice  ECLOGUE the FIRST  SELIM or the Shepherd's Moral  SCENE a Valley near  Bagdat  TIME the MORNING  YE  Persian  Maids attend your Poet's Lays  And hear how Shepherds pass their golden Days  Not all are blest whom Fortune's Hand sustains  With Wealth in Courts nor all that haunt the Plains  Well may your Hearts believe the Truths I tell  'Tis Virtue makes the Bliss where'er we dwell  Thus  Selim  sung by sacred Truth inspir'd  No Praise the Youth but her's alone desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning Songs convey'd  Informing Morals to the Shepherd Maid  Or taught the Swains that surest Bliss to find  What Groves nor Streams bestow a virtuous Mind  When sweet and od'rous like an Eastern Bride  The radiant Morn resum'd her orient Pride  When wanton Gales along the Valleys play  Breathe on each Flow'r and bear their Sweets away  By  Tigris'  Wand'rer Waves he sate and sung  This useful Lesson for the Fair and Young  Ye  Persian  Dames he said to ye belong  Well may they please the Morals of my Song  No fairer Maids I trust than ye are found  Grac'd with soft Arts the peopled World around  The Morn that lights you to your Loves supplies  Each gentler Ray delicious to your Eyes  For ye those Flow'rs her fragrant Hands bestow  And yours the Love that Kings delight to know  Yet think not these all beauteous as they are  The best kind Blessings Heav'n can grant the Fair  Who trust alone in Beauty's feeble Ray  The Gulph of that Name famous for the Pearlfishery  Balsora  's Pearls have more of Worth than they  Drawn from the Deep they sparkle to the Sight  And allunconscious shoot a lust'rous Light  Such are the Maids and such the Charms they boast  By Sense unaided or to Virtue lost  Selfflattering Sex your Hearts believe in vain  That Love shall blind when once he fires the Swain  Or hope a Lover by your Faults to win  As Spots on Ermin beautify the Skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her Care  Each softer Virtue that adorns the Fair  Each tender Passion Man delights to find  The lov'd Perfections of a female Mind  Blest were the Days when Wisdom held her Reign  And Shepherds sought her on the silent Plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret Grove  The faireyed Truth and Daughters bless'd their Love  O haste fair Maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy Shrub for ye shall love our Shore  By  Ind'  excell'd or  Araby  no more  ost to our Fields for so the Fates ordain  he dear Deserters shall return again  O come thou Modesty as they decree  The Rose may then improve her Blush by Thee  Here make thy Court amidst our rural Scene  And ShepherdGirls shall own Thee for their Queen  With Thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious Maid  But Man the most not more the Mountain Doe  Holds the swift Falcon for her deadly Foe  Cold is her Breast like Flow'rs that drink the Dew  A silken Veil conceals her from the View  No wild Desires amidst thy Train be known  But Faith whose Heart is fix'd on one alone  Desponding Meekness with her downcast Eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender Sighs  And Love the last By these your Hearts approve  These are the Virtues that must lead to Love  Thus sung the Swain and Eastern Legends say  The Maids of  Bagdat  verify'd the Lay  Dear to the Plains the Virtues came along  The Shepherds lov'd and  Selim  bless'd his Song  The END of the First ECLOGUE  ECLOGUE the SECOND  HASSAN or the Cameldriver  SCENE the Desart  TIME MIDDAY  IN silent Horror o'er the DesartWaste  The Driver  Hassan  with his Camels past  One Cruise of Water on his Back he bore  And his light Scrip contain'd a scanty Store  A Fan of painted Feathers in his Hand  To guard his shaded Face from scorching Sand  The sultry Sun had gain'd the middle Sky  And not a Tree and not an Herb was nigh  The Beasts with Pain their dusty Way pursue  Shrill roar'd the Winds and dreary was the View  With desp'rate Sorrow wild th' affrighted Man  Thrice sigh'd thrice strook his Breast and thus began  Sad was the Hour and luckless was the Day  When first from  Schiraz'  Walls I bent my Way  Ah little thought I of the blasting Wind  The Thirst or pinching Hunger that I find  Bethink thee  Hassan  where shall Thirst assuage  When fails this Cruise his unrelenting Rage  Soon shall this Scrip its precious Load resign  Then what but Tears and Hunger shall be thine  Ye mute Companions of my Toils that bear  In all my Griefs a more than equal Share  Here where no Springs in Murmurs break away  Or Mosscrown'd Fountains mitigate the Day  In vain ye hope the green Delights to know  Which Plains more blest or verdant Vales bestow  Here Rocks alone and tasteless Sands are found  And faint and sickly Winds for ever howl around  Sad was the Hour  c  Curst be the Gold and Silver which persuade  Weak Men to follow farfatiguing Trade  The LillyPeace outshines the silver Store  And Life is dearer than the golden Ore  Yet Money tempts us o'er the Desart brown  To ev'ry distant Mart and wealthy Town  Full oft we tempt the Land and oft the Sea  And are we only yet repay'd by Thee  Ah why was Ruin so attractive made  Or why fond Man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not whilst mad we haste along  The gentle Voice of Peace or Pleasure's Song  Or wherefore think the flow'ry Mountain's Side  The Fountain's Murmurs and the Valley's Pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary Desarts if they lead to Gold  Sad was the Hour  c  O cease my Fears all frantic as I go  When Thought creates unnumber'd Scenes of Woe  What if the Lion in his Rage I meet  Oft in the Dust I view his printed Feet  And fearful oft when Day's declining Light  Yields her pale Empire to the Mourner Night  By Hunger rous'd he scours the groaning Plain  Gaunt Wolves and sullen Tygers in his Train  Before them Death with Shrieks directs their Way  Fills the wild Yell and leads them to their Prey  Sad was the Hour c  At that dead Hour the silent Asp shall creep  If ought of rest I find upon my Sleep  Or some swoln Serpent twist his Scales around  And wake to Anguish with a burning Wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented Poor  From Lust of Wealth and Dread of Death secure  They tempt no Desarts and no Griefs they find  Peace rules the Day where Reason rules the Mind  Sad was the Hour c  O hapless Youth for she thy Love hath won  The tender  Zara  will be most undone  Big swell'd my Heart and own'd the pow'rful Maid  When fast she dropt her Tears as thus she said  " Farewel the Youth whom Sighs could not detain  " Whom  Zara  's breaking Heart implor'd in vain  " Yet as thou go'st may ev'ry Blast arise  " Weak and unfelt as these rejected Sighs  " Safe o'er the Wild no Perils mayst thou see  " No Griefs endure nor weep false Youth like me"  O let me safely to the Fair return  Say with a Kiss she must not shall not mourn  Go teach my Heart to lose its painful Fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's Voice and  Zara  's Tears  He said and call'd on Heav'n to bless the Day  When back to  Schiraz'  Walls he bent his Way  The END of the Second ECLOGUE  ECLOGUE the THIRD  ABRA or the  Georgian  Sultana  SCENE a Forest  TIME the EVENING  IN  Georgia  's Land where  Tefflis'  Tow'rs are seen  In distant View along the level Green  While Ev'ning Dews enrich the glitt'ring Glade  And the tall Forests cast a longer Shade  Amidst the Maids of  Zagen  's peaceful Grove  Emyra  sung the pleasing Cares of Love  Of  Abra  first began the tender Strain  Who led her Youth with Flocks upon the Plain  At Morn she came those willing Flocks to lead  Where Lillies rear them in the wat'ry Mead  From early Dawn the livelong Hours she told  'Till late at silent Eve she penn'd the Fold  Deep in the Grove beneath the secret Shade  A various Wreath of od'rous Flow'rs she made  That these Flowers are found in very great Abundance in some of the Provinces of  Persia  see the  Modern History  of the ingenious Mr  Salmon  Gaymotley'd Pinks and sweet Junquils she chose  The Violetblue that on the Mossbank grows  Allsweet to Sense the flaunting Rose was there  The finish'd Chaplet welladorn'd her Hair  Great  Abbas  chanc'd that fated Morn to stray  By Love conducted from the Chace away  Among the vocal Vales he heard her Song  And sought the Vales and echoing Groves among  At length he found and woo'd the rural Maid  She knew the Monarch and with Fear obey'd  Be ev'ry Youth like Royal  Abbas  mov'd  And ev'ry  Georgian  Maid like  Abra  lov'd  The Royal Lover bore her from the Plain  Yet still her Crook and bleating Flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her View  And bad that Crook and bleating Flock Adieu  Fair happy Maid to other Scenes remove  To richer Scenes of golden Pow'r and Love  Go leave the simple Pipe and Shepherd's Strain  With Love delight thee and with  Abbas  reign  Be ev'ry Youth  c  Yet midst the Blaze of Courts she fix'd her Love  On the cool Fountain or the shady Grove  Still with the Shepherd's Innocence her Mind  To the sweet Vale and flow'ry Mead inclin'd  And oft as Spring renew'd the Plains with Flow'rs  Breath'd his soft Gales and led the fragrant Hours  With sure Return she sought the sylvan Scene  The breezy Mountains and the Forests green  Her Maids around her mov'd a duteous Band  Each bore a Crook allrural in her Hand  Some simple Lay of Flocks and Herds they sung  With Joy the Mountain and the Forest rung  Be ev'ry Youth  c  And oft the Royal Lover left the Care  And Thorns of State attendant on the Fair  Oft to the Shades and lowroof'd Cots retir'd  Or sought the Vale where first his Heart was fir'd  A Russet Mantle like a Swain he wore  And thought of Crowns and busy Courts no more  Be ev'ry Youth  c  Blest was the Life that Royal  Abbas  led  Sweet was his Love and innocent his Bed  What if in Wealth the noble Maid excel  The simple Shepherd Girl can love as well  Let those who rule on  Persia  's jewell'd Throne  Be fam'd for Love and gentlest Love alone  Or wreath like  Abbas  full of fair Renown  The Lover's Myrtle with the Warrior's Crown  Oh happy Days the Maids around her say  Oh haste profuse of Blessings haste away  Be ev'ry Youth like Royal  Abbas  mov'd  And ev'ry  Georgian  Maid like  Abra  lov'd  The END of the Third ECLOGUE  ECLOGUE the FOURTH  AGIB and SECANDER or the Fugitives  SCENE a Mountain in  Circassia  TIME MIDNIGHT  IN fair  Circassia  where to Love inclin'd  Each Swain was blest for ev'ry Maid was kind  At that still Hour when awful Midnight reigns  And none but Wretches haunt the twilight Plains  What Time the Moon had hung her Lamp on high  And past in Radiance thro' the cloudless Sky  Sad o'er the Dews two Brother Shepherds fled  Where wild'ring Fear and desp'rate Sorrow led  Fast as they prest their Flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd Plains and Valleys stole away  Along the Mountain's bending Sides they ran  Till faint and weak  Secander  thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee  Agib  for my Feet deny  No longer friendly to my Life to fly  Friend of my Heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our sad Flight thro' all its length of Way  And first review that longextended Plain  And yon wide Groves already past with Pain  Yon ragged Cliff whose dang'rous Path we try'd  And last this lofty Mountain's weary Side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The Toils of Flight or some severer Woe  Still as I haste the  Tartar  shouts behind  And Shrieks and Sorrows load the sad'ning Wind  In rage of Heart with Ruin in his Hand  He blasts our Harvests and deforms our Land  Yon Citron Grove whence first in Fear we came  Droops its fair Honours to the conqu'ring Flame  Far fly the Swains like us in deep Despair  And leave to ruffian Bands their fleecy Care  SECANDER  Unhappy Land whose Blessings tempt the Sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy  Persian  Lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine Aid  To shield the Shepherd and protect the Maid  Far off in thoughtless Indolence resign'd  Soft Dreams of Love and Pleasure sooth his Mind  'Midst fair  Sultanas  lost in idle Joy  No Wars alarm him and no Fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green Hills in Summer's sultry Heat  Have lent the Monarch oft a cool Retreat  Sweet to the Sight is  Zabran  's flow'ry Plain  And once by Maids and Shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the Virgins shall delight to rove  By  Sargis'  Banks or  Irwan  's shady Grove  On  Tarkie  's Mountain catch the cooling Gale  Or breathe the Sweets of  Aly  's flow'ry Vale  Fair Scenes but ah no more with Peace possest  With Ease alluring and with Plenty blest  No more the Shepherds whit'ning Seats appear  Nor the kind Products of a bounteous Year  No more the Dale with snowy Blossoms crown'd  But Ruin spreads her baleful Fires around  SECANDER  In vain  Circassia  boasts her spicy Groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy Loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the Fair  Their Eyes' blue languish and their golden Hair  Those Eyes in Tears their fruitless Grief must send  Those Hairs the  Tartar  's cruel Hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye  Georgian  Swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia  's Ruin and the Waste of War  Some weightier Arms than Crooks and Staves prepare  To shield your Harvests and defend your Fair  The  Turk  and  Tartar  like Designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his Land in native Deserts bred  By Lust incited or by Malice led  The Villain  Arab  as he prowls for Prey  Oft marks with Blood and wasting Flames the Way  Yet none so cruel as the  Tartar  Foe  To Death inur'd and nurst in Scenes of Woe  He said when loud along the Vale was heard  A shriller Shriek and nearer Fires appear'd  Th' affrighted Shepherds thro' the Dews of Night  Wide o'er the Moonlight Hills renew'd their Flight  The END of the Fourth and last ECLOGUE
