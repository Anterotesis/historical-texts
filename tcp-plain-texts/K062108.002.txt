 EUPHEMIA  BY Mrs  CHARLOTTE LENNOX  IN FOUR VOLUMES  VOL II  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND AND J EVANS PATERNOSTERROW  M DCC XC  me no matter for observation either of praise or censure and consequently nothing for your entertainment They are neither handsome nor ugly witty nor foolish aukward nor wellbred they are in that class of mediocrity which leaves one nothing to say but that they are good sort of people However there was another lady expected who I supposed had some claim to distinction for upon the mention of Lady Jackson every one had something to say of her 'She was at church last Sunday' said one lady  quite new dressed in her fourth mourning that is for the last quarter you know and looked mighty well  To be sure she is a very  personable  woman  said another  and has a fine presence but any one would look well dressed to such advantage as she is I dare say she had not less than twenty pounds value of gauzes and blonds and feathers about her  Aye she had plenty of white plumes on her head  said a third lady  I suppose  it is the fashion in London to wear so many for Lady Jackson would rather be dead than out of the fashion and they say indeed she spends twothirds of her income in clothes though she is not young and never was handsome and to my thinking that prodigious quantity of feathers she wears is very frightful for when she came into church being a very tall woman and walking through the crowd she overtopped every body and her white plumes nodding as she moved appeared like those carried before the hearse of some batchelor or maid in a funeral  EVERY one laughed at this conceit and Mr Greville happening to sit near me I asked him in a low voice  who is this Lady Jackson  She is the widow of a rich citizen  said he  who was knighted in the last promotion of bobwigs and laced waistcoats The lady so little understands this honour  so envied by every alderman's wife in London that she thinks it equals her with a countess and if she knew how she would assume the dignified manners of quality as well as their dress but her breeding is coarse and her opportunities of improvement few One leading card in her character I cannot pass over it is her insuperable vanity which makes her imagine that every man who looks upon her is in love with her No maiden can be secure of the constancy of her lover no wife of the fidelity of her husband if Lady Jackson comes in the way This folly of hers is so apparent that it draws a great deal of ridicule upon her from the men who feed it with the grossest flattery which she swallows as greedily as ifas Shakspeare says  Her appetite grew with what it fed on  But it is not only to the praise of beauty she aspires she unites if you believe her professions every amiable  quality in her mind as well as every grace in her person She is far gone in the refinements of friendship she tastes with the highest relish the luxury of benevolence while her insincerity incapacitates her for the one and her selfishness for the other  'It must be confessed' said I  that you are going to introduce me to a very valuable acquaintance  I could not avoid inviting her  replied he  as she is upon a visit to a lady in the neighbourhood who is my intimate friend besides I am fond of extraordinary characters I have given you but the bare outlines of Lady Jackson's the lady will finish the picture herself  I WAS obliged however to wait some time longer for this satisfaction and dinner was ready to be served before Lady Jackson came doubtless this delay was an effect of the same policy  which makes our celebrated beauties enter the church and the playhouse when the service is half over in the former and the second act of the comedy begun in the latter  At length Lady Jackson was announced she entered the room with a masculine step and such an air of confidence in the superiority of her charms and her dress as at the first moment inspired me with disgust  Mr GREVILLE who knew that dinner only waited for her led her immediately into the dininghall expressing his concern by the way that Mrs Derwent did not accompany her Lady Jackson told him that Mrs Derwent was so much indisposed that she could not venture abroad and that she had sat by her bedside in great uneasiness all the morning This was the first time I had heard her voice which is loud and harsh and so little did her countenance  express the sensibility she would be thought to possess that her mouth was screwed up into an affected simper while her eyes were fixed upon the large glass that fronted the door by which she entered and shewed her her figure at full length This sight had the force of magic and seemed to have rivetted her feet to the spot where she stood when Mr Greville by a gentle violence led her to her seat at the table which was on my right hand She soon entered into a particular conversation with me admired the elegance of my undress asked who was my millener and how much my lace cost a yard and in a decisive tone assured me every thing I had on was perfectly fashionable  AFTER dinner when we were got back to the drawingroom being still seated near me she renewed the discourse and making a sudden transition from the trimming of gowns to which she condescended to ask my opinion  of she talked of books ran over the names of Milton Shakespeare Dryden PopeBut her observations and criticisms were confined to exclamations ofexcellent divine inimitable which she uttered with great vehemence while she entered more deeply into the merits of Mariveaux and Marmontel the characters of the former were so naturalthe tales of the latter so charmingso interesting This flow of erudition was stopped by the attention the company seemed willing to give to a lady who was relating to the person that sat next her a melancholy accident which had happened to an acquaintance of her'sa gentleman who was killed by a fall from his horse and brought home dead to his wife a few hours after he had left her in high health and spirits The wretched wife was seised with convulsions at the sight and died the next day  LADY JACKSON being a widow herself it was her part to be more affected than any one else with this sad story she sighed aloud My uncle observed that such instances of conjugal affection were very rare  'Very rare indeed' said Mr Greville  for one such afflicted widow we shall see a hundred who as Pope one of your admired authors Madam  said he addressing himself to Lady Jackson 'has it  Bear about the mockery of woe  To midnight dances and the public shew  'Oh dear Sir' said Lady Jackson 'you are very fevere'  'Not at all Madam' said he  for although my censures are general I admit of some exceptions But to speak the truth there is no virtue now so common as fortitude nor any thing  so superfluous as the custom of comforting All the poisons of Thessaly might safely be trusted in the hands of the mourners of our time  'I HOPE Sir' said Lady Jackson  you include the male mourners in this observation  'CERTAINLY Madam' said Mr Greville  there are men I believe who would be glad to outlive not only their friends and relations but even the age they live in and their very country and rather than die would willingly stay in the world alone  I AM sure there is no woman of that mind  said Lady Jackson  'For a very good reason Madam' said Mr Greville  there would be nobody to admire her  'You are a perfect cynic' replied the Lady gravely and rising walked up to a window from which there was a prospect of a very fine flowergarden which she commended greatly Mr Greville assured her it was part of his business every morning to dress that garden 'For' added he  I am a great admirer of beauty wherever I meet it but because it is a dangerous thing in women's faces I had rather contemplate it in these flowers  LADY JACKSON who has it seems a very happy facility in appropriating these sort of speeches to herself immediately changed her manner she became lively witty goodhumoured but her vivacity shewed itself in boisterous laughs at a jest of her own finding out her wit in scraps of poetry quoted at random and her goodhumour in familiar nods smiles indelicate praise and taps on the shoulder  rather heavy indeed for the hand that gave them was robust and the manner truly masculine  MR Greville kept up the scene so long that the lady departed in full persuasion that she had made a conquest and this notion of her's afforded my uncle some diversion but I was concerned that her folly had been soothed so agreeably for if happiness be but opinion Mr Greville had made her happy and what was this but to reward and continue folly  I WAS malicious enough to wish she had been a secret witness of the ridicule cast upon her by the very man whom she imagined was beginning to feel the influence of her charms But enough and indeed too much of this lady if it were not that she has earnestly requested me to make her the bearer of a letter to you whose character she professes to be an idolater of She says she has some  relations in New York who by their station and connections may be of use to Mr Neville and this being confirmed to me by Mr Greville she will have the happiness to present this letter to you Oh envied happiness could she taste itbut that is impossible for minds like your's and her's can never mix Adieu my dear Euphemia  LETTER XVIII  MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  By this time you have received my last letter which Lady Jackson transported with the opportunity it gave her of being acquainted with you promised to deliver to you herself I am impatient till you give me an account of your interview I am sure you will be diverted with her peculiarities for you only smile at follies which make me peevish  I HAVE been surprised with a letter from Mr Harley a country fellow gave it to my maid She asked if it required an answer he said he had no orders about that but he would wait  IT should seem that he had chosen his time well for Mr Greville and my uncle had rode out to take the air about a quarter of an hour before he came  TO MISS HARLEY  MADAM  LOW as my fortunes are I never till now laboured under the weight of pecuniary obligations But can any thing be humiliating that comes from you Oh why was this soft attention to my situation shewn me at a time when my reason was still free enough to combat those sentiments which the first sight of you inspired Sentiments which the implacability of your uncle and a just sense of my own unworthiness convinced me I ought to suppressI ought it is true but I never can suppress them and all I dare to hope for from your goodness is that you will pardon the boldness  of this confession and pity the misfortune of him that makes it I am and ever will be Madam  Your devoted servant EDWARD HARLEY  WELL my dear Euphemia what do you think of this letter is there not something extremely affecting in the manner in which this young man speaks of his situation He is humble without meanness and dignifies poverty by the nobleness of his sentiments Dearly as I love my uncle grateful as my heart is for his generosity to me I must blame him a little for the implacability of his temper as Mr Harley calls it which hinders him from distinguishing between the guilty and the innocent and makes him suffer the heir of his honour and fortunes to languish in indigence and obscurity  You will readily allow that I was under the necessity of answering this letter which I certainly should not have done had it contained only a declaration of love but it was just to set him right with regard to the pecuniary obligation as he considers it Here then is what I wrote  TO MR HARLEY  SIR  IT was by my uncle's command that I enclosed to you the note which your grateful disposition seems to lay too great a stress upon Both my uncle and myself were under the highest obligations to you who hazarded your own life to prevent our suffering a slight inconvenience It is but just that you should know this was the sense he had of your generous behaviour and the accident that befel you in consequence of it being likely to produce some inconveniences to you who  was far from home and unattended this was the cause of the liberty he took in offering you some assistance I am apprehensive from the turn of your letter that you will reject what you consider as an obligation when you know it came from him This is what I sincerely wish to prevent for it will be a means of increasing and continuing that illwill which has unhappily taken place between your families As in the circumstances we both are I can neither receive nor answer any more letters without hazarding my uncle's displeasure I take this opportunity to assure you that I am with all the esteem that is due to you Sir  Your very humble servant MARIA HARLEY  TELL me my dear Euphemia have I done right in answering his letter thus or indeed in answering it at all I shall  not be easy till I have your approbation which is so respected and revered by me that I should prefer it to reason itself if they were two things that could be separated and one of them left to my choice Adieu  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XIX MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  I AM just returned from Lord S's seat where I have spent a week It was a farewel visit and like all other farewel visits was begun in pleasure and ended in tears The very day after my return your Lady Jackson called upon me introducing herself with a letter from you I could not open it with any propriety as I heard from her that you were in health so I missed the advantage of knowing her character without the help of my own observations but to say the truth there is no need of any great acuteness to make one's self mistress of the subject for the features  of her mind are as strongly marked as those of her face and like a book printed in a large letter the weakest eyes may read her  WITH a familiarity which she borrowed from the notion of her superior rank she invited herself to tea with me and in less than half an hour professed and claimed in return an ardent and inviolable friendship Having thus laid the foundations of an entire confidence she entertained me with the history of her life in which like all other romances love made the principal partshe is a perfect homicide There was no end to the murders of her eyes then for conjugal affection none ever equalled her Those widows whose tears antiquity hath hallowed were but the shadows of her substantial grief She left me at length after a strict embrace to the pleasure your letters always afford me  YOUR former large packet found me at Lord S's it is full of adventure my dear Maria The unexpected meeting between your uncle and Mr Harley has had consequences that will certainly produce some interesting events The merit of the young man and the natural good disposition of Sir John prepare a scene in which you will perhaps have a part How greatly am I obliged to you for giving me in your charming journal so large a share of your conversation The scene will soon change with me and then my narratives may become interesting for at present my days run on in one dull tenor and afford nothing to engage your attention  I HAVE another letter from you this momentthings have fallen out just as I expectedMr Harley is your conquest Well there is nothing surprising in that  he has a heart and you have conquering eyes  You compliment too highly when you lay so great a stress upon my advice and approbation  You have no need of any precepts nor indeed of any instruction you cannot wander from the right if you go not astray from your own inclination nor do amiss if you borrow not a frailty which is none of your own Your letter seems dictated by prudence itself I wish indeed there had been no concealment in the case but I see not how you could have shewn Mr Harley's letter to your uncle there is one severe expression in it which would doubtless have given him great offence and would perhaps have clouded for ever those dawnings of goodwill which broke out in spite of himself in consequence of his engaging behaviour  WE are to dine tomorrow on board the man of war which is to carry the colonel and his family of which we are considered as a part to New York I know the mention of this circumstance will raise some tumults in your breast but you must accustom yourself my  dear Maria to bear these preludes to our parting that the parting itself may not fall so heavy upon you  MRS Benson has settled all her affairs and having no relations but such as are much richer than herself she has sunk part of her little fortune in an annuity for her life and the remainder she has bequeathed to me Her good sense and obliging manners endear her to every one that knows her I am most happy in this consideration that having lost my mother and upon the point of being separated from you I have the comfort to enjoy such a companionsuch a monitor and friend  I AM to spend this evening with Lady Jackson in consequence of so pressing an invitation that I know not how to refuse It shall not be my fault if our intercourse of visits do not end here She would be my friend that is according to her notion of the thinga  companion in my amusementsone who returns my visits most punctually never fails to send daily enquiries after my health if I am the least indisposed and a most strict observer of all the civil duties of life But by a friend I mean a witness of the conscience a physician of secret griefs a moderator in prosperity and a guide in adversity How little are such as the qualified to act that part But you tell me she styles herself an idolater of my character A good opinion it has been said lays one under an obligation let it come from whom it will but it is only truly valuable when it proceeds from the wise the candid and the virtuous  AT NIGHT  I CANNOT close my letter without giving you an account of a most extravagantly kind proposal Lady Jackson made meI was obliged to stay till the rest of her company were gone two  of whom she said were her intimate friends married ladies whose husbands she gave me to understand were to her great grief so much in love with her that she lived in continual apprehension left their unfortunate passions should be discovered by their wives whose peace of mind such a discovery would entirely destroy  As she seemed impatient for my opinion and advice upon this her very hard case I told her gravely that I had no advice to offer her but to keep the secret carefully herself in order to prevent as far as lay in her power the bad consequences she apprehended She then suddenly changed the discourse loaded me with a thousand professions of friendship and called it a misfortune to have known me since she was to lose me so soon execrated my husband's uncle for driving him by his unjust parsimony to the necessity of going abroad  'BUT I have thought of a way' said she  to prevent that necessity if you will do me the honour to accept my offer I have some money unemployed I will lay it out in the purchase of a small estate in any county in England that will be most agreeable to you It shall be yours for ever if you will yours at least as long as you may want it Tell me you will accept my offertell me so and make me happy  MY first emotions on this speech were all gratitude and surprise at the uncommon generosity it displayed but her looks and manners bore so little affinity with her words that a moment afterwards I could scarce persuade myself she was in earnest for while she was pouring out these effusions of friendship and benevolence she had her eyes often turned towards the class with a complacency that shewed how much her thoughts were taken up with the object it represented  And in the midst of her earnest entreaties that I would accept her offer her hands were often employed in setting the flounces of her petticoat adjusting her tucker or pinning up a curl These observations cooled the first warmth of my gratitude I expressed my acknowledgments however for the generosity of her offer in civil terms assuring her I should never forget it but that I had some very powerful reasons for declining it She would know my reasonsI told her my husband was obliged in honour to fulfil his engagements and that however painful it might be to me to leave my friends and my country I hoped I should always be able to sacrifice my inclination to his duty and reputation That I had received from a dear and valuable friend with whom I had been connected from my earliest youth offers of the same generous nature with her's and which on the same account I had been obliged to refuse  SHE seemed satisfied with my excuse but lamented in very passionate terms her misfortune in being hopeless to prevail upon me We parted with great cordiality on her side and much civility on mine  WHEN I related what had passed in this visit to my husband and Mrs Benson they diverted themselves extremely with my credulity which they thought much greater than it was for I did not endeavour to undeceive them being really in some doubt whether I should wrong her by suspecting her sincerity I shall be able when I write next to tell when our voyage is determined upon Adieu My dear Maria  LETTER XX MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  WELL my dear friend I have six weeks good yet This news was like a reprieve to one under a painful sentence for I reckoned upon no more than a fortnight at farthest May I not hope then to have one week of your dear society granted by your uncle Do my Maria make the request now while Sir John is with his friend your absence will be more easily supported by him Tell him I entreat this favour and I will number it among the many instances I have received of his goodness which will live in my memory for ever  NEVER having been on board a ship in my life you will easily conceive my dear Maria how much I was affected with a sight so new and strange as that of theman of war where I dined yesterday in company with Colonel Bellenden his lady and eldest daughter It was a beautiful but to me terrific object when I considered that in such a frail building I was to traverse an immense ocean every thing I saw produced astonishment and excited my curiosity so that I asked a thousand foolish questions which were however answered with great civility by the gentlemen about us by whom we were conducted round this little world and shewn every thing worthy our observation  THE commander is a young man very genteel in his person and dress his manners are polite soft and insinuating but in my opinion he has too much of the courtier and too little of the chief He  suffered greatly in the comparison with Colonel Bellenden who in his person and manners unites dignity with sweetness the martial air of a soldier with the elegance of the gentleman the noble frankness of his profession with the politeness of a man of quality  THE captain presented his principal officers to Colonel Bellenden and the ladies Miss Bellenden had reason to be pleased with the effect of her charms every eye was rivetted upon her every tongue seemed ready to pronounce her beautiful I wish I could say she received this involuntary homage with greater propriety she even seemed to claim more than was paid her a conscious simper an affected toss of her head a careless air and a wandering eye that seemed searching for new victims to gratify her pride of conquest proclaimed the temper of her mind  THE handsome it has been said with great truth can never be seen without respect and their youth hath not more days than their beauty hath triumphsthey conquer as often as they appear but the mischief of it is that their triumphs are short their youth is not lasting and the handsome at last grow ugly Queens and princesses said your Mr Neville once in my hearing grow old and there is no ancient beauty but that of the sun and the stars What a pity it is then that the generality of our sex neglect to acquire in youth those qualities which may preserve them from contempt when they are old and secure esteem when they can no longer excite admiration  I SUSPECTED that my husband and Mrs Benson by their whispering and significant smiles at each other whenever I mentioned Lady Jackson and her uncommonly generous offers had some mischief in their heads and today it  came out I had passed the whole morning in the city making some purchases for our approaching voyage during which Lady Jackson paid me a visit Mrs Benson received her in my absence and listened for a whole hour to her extravagant professions of friendship for me and repinings at my cruel reserve which would not permit her to be of some use to me Mrs Benson excused me upon that delicacy which made persons born in affluence and accustomed to bestow not to receive favours shy of laying themselves under great and unreturnable obligations This called forth an oftentatious display of the most liberal sentiments from Lady Jackson delivered with an impetuosity of voice and action peculiar to herself Again she regretted her misfortune in not being permitted to shew the ardour of her affection for me by some substantial proofs  MRS Benson seemed moved with the enthusiasm of her friendship and after a little pause said  It is a pity such generous warmth should fail of its purpose I have thought of a way by which you may gratify your earnest desire of serving Mrs Neville without wounding her delicacy  'PRAY name it' said Lady Jackson with a look and accent in which much of her former fervour was abated  'WHY Madam' said Mrs Benson  you must certainly have heard of the fatal wreck of my friend's once shining fortunes and that all those possessions to which she was born the heiress fell by her father's imprudence into the hands of his creditors In a day or two she is likely to suffer a very sensible mortification by the sale of a very fine collection of pictures which her father in a tour through Italy  purchased at an immense expence Some of these pictures were so highly valued by her mother whose memory she almost adores that I am persuaded you could not do her a more acceptable service than to prevent them from going into other hands by purchasing them for her If you please I will attend you to the auctionroom and point out to you those particular pictures which she so ardently wished to be possessed of so that when the sale takes place you may have them  'YOU are very obliging' said Lady Jackson with a confused accent and a freezing look  I shall not fail to give you notice when I am more at leisure than at present being really very particularly engaged  She then rose up and took her leave leaving kind compliments for me  WHEN I came home I found Mr Neville and Mrs Benson enjoying their triumph over my credulity and Mr Neville after his usual manner dictating to me upon the choice of my friends and affirming that he only was the proper judge of what persons I ought to admit into my friendship and confidence I pleaded hard for an exemption with regard to my female acquaintance but he insisted that we were no better judges of one another than we are of the men and that a wife has nothing to do but to leave the choice to her husband's discernment You may be sure I did not yield this point without a little contest but in regard to Mr Neville I have often experienced the truth of that observation that with some persons it is not safe to be reasonable Whenever it happens that my arguments press home upon him he has recourse to an expedient that never fails to silence me he falls into a passionI say not a  word morehappy if silence will shelter me but that is seldom the case for he pursues me even to this last retreat and nothing will serve him but my confession that he has convinced me I am in the wrong For the sake of peace I submit to this and presently afterwards in some new instance this confession is turned against me with  Why will you pretend to debate this matter with me you know you are generally wrongnay you acknowledge it too Why will you depend upon your own judgment which you are so often obliged to own always misleads you  However as we both agree in our high opinion of you my Maria I may without fear of rebuke subscribe myself ever your faithful and affectionate  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  P S  I have just learned that Lady Jackson is gone out of town for a week by which time she knew the sale of the pictures would be over Is not this a strange woman I was vexed this trial was made a very little reflection might have served to convince me that she meant nothing by all those highsounding professions and offersTruth is simple and modest and when she cannot shew herself by real effects will scorn to do it in words  YOU will be pleased to hear that Lord S has actually promised to purchase those pictures for me which my mother most valued My husband and Mrs Benson knew this when they thought fit to make this trial of the lady's sincerity otherwise I should have thought it an unpardonable meanness  IF I am to be indulged with a visit from you give me speedy notice of it that I may enjoy the blessing by anticipation  E N  LETTER XXI MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  YES my dear Euphemia our wishes are granted I am permitted to stay a week with you My uncle did not wait to be requested he kindly proposed this little excursion to me as soon as he knew that the time was fixed for your leaving England Oh that thought but I will not distress you by my useless grief  I HAVE had an interview with Mr Harley You are surprisedyou blame me perhaps but hear how it happened and you will acquit me I hope of imprudence since it was really out of my power to prevent it  I HAD wandered into that delightful wood where since my abode at this seat I have passed so many hours in sweet yet painful recollection I was employed in reading some of your letters when the sound of steps at a distance made me turn to see who was coming Guess my surprise when I saw it was Mr Harley I stopped uncertain what to do or how to take this unexpected intrusion He advanced with a slow and timid pace his hat under his arm his eyes cast on the ground as if he was fearful to meet my quickenquiring glance I remained immoveable he approached me bowing respectfully  'DO not be surprised Miss Harley' said he  wdo not be offended that being soon to absent myself from you perhaps for ever I have ventured to break in upon your solitude I could not depart without the satisfaction of breathing at your feet those vows my  heart made the first moment I beheld you  And he actually my dear threw himself at my feet with the air of an Orondates  THE place his posture his language had all so romantic an air that I could not help smiling as I desired him to rise He did rise but with a disconcerted look while a deep blush overspread his cheeks  I PERCEIVED the fault I had been guilty of and was angry with myself for having wounded a sensibility so affecting The alteration in my looks and manner relieved his confusion  'MAY I hope' said he  that you will pardon my presumption in coming to find you here  'THE presumption of this visit Sir' said I  may be easily pardoned but the imprudence of it I am afraid all  things considered cannot be justified Have you not called my uncle implacable and indeed to you perhaps he appears so  'And is he not so Madam' replied he  to my family I am sorry to arraign the conduct of a person who has had judgment enough to do justice to your merit but can his long continued enmity to my father the friend and companion of his youth his nearest kinsman be excused  Not unless he had received some great injury  I replied  'From my father Madam' interrupted he  impossible my father is not capable of injuring any one much less his friend his relation and as I have heard his benefactor  I cast down my eyes and was silent the noble warmth the filial tenderness  that appeared in his words his accent and his looks affected me I tried to dissipate a starting tear it would not do and I applied my handkerchief to my eyeshe looked eagerly at me  'WHAT can this mean' said he  You seem greatly moved Madam do you know the cause of this long continued hatred on the part of Sir John for as for my father he appears to have no resentment against him he speaks of him with respect nay kindness What can he have done to offend him so highly  'Nothing' replied I  unless you will allow it was an offence to supplant him in his love for a most amiable object  'Nothing' exclaimed he eagerly  do you call that nothing which was to stab him to the heartit was worse it was to make him live wretched  But was it his fault that he was the successful lover Yet that word  supplant  implies some baseness in his conduct Baseness my father act basely that cannot be I conjure you Madam speak plainly I perceive you are well acquainted with the particulars of this affairI wish to know them what has escaped you has given me great uneasiness pray inform me further  'If what I have said' replied I  has given you uneasiness why should I increase it by complying with your request I must beg to be excused from saying any more  'I see how it is' said he  my father will suffer by this explanation I must not expect it from your delicacyevery way I am unhappy  He sighed deeply and was silent for a moment then added  Well Madam every thing concurs to shew me the imprudence the hopelessness of that passion I have dared to entertain I came to take my leave but do not imagine that I expect my cure from absenceperhaps I do not wish it  'Pray no more of this' said I confused as you may well imagine at this conversation  but tell me where you are going  I am going to seek my fortune in the Indies  said he  for I lie here a dead weight upon my father who finds it difficult enough to bring up a large family of girls upon his slender income  'To the Indies' interrupted I  pray in what capacity Are you to be dignified with a commission and the title of captain or colonel in the Company's troops or are you to be a trader  yourself    I have no talents for either  said he smiling He was going on when I heard my uncle's voice calling me at a distance  'I would not have you seen here' said I  on any account pray retire If you are resolved to go to the Indies make Mr Greville acquainted with your design he is your friend and will be glad of an opportunity of serving you  I POINTED out to him the path he was to take in order to avoid meeting my uncle and curtseying low turned from him He followed me two or three steps and taking my hand respectfully raised it to his lips I felt it wet with a falling tear He darted like lightning from me and in an instant was out of sight  I met my uncle a moment afterwards he said he had been looking for  me and pointing to Mr Greville who was following him'Our host' said he  is come to take leave of you he has received news which obliges him to set out for the North immediately  Mr Greville accordingly joined us and we walked with him to the gate where his postchaise waited  I WAS very much concerned at his departure on Mr Harley's account to whom I know he wishes well I was not without a hope that his representations of the young gentleman's case might have made some impression upon my uncle and induced him to prevent the heir of his title and fortune from seeking a subsistence in so distant a part of the globe for my uncle is naturally good but the best virtues have need of some standard to guide them  We are to return to the Hall tomorrow and the next day I am to set out for London Oh this meeting what  joy would it afford me were it not so soon to be followed by a long long absence How can I support the thought There is no friendship in the world of so much use to me as yours it is my defence in all my contestsit is my consolation in all my distresses but what is still more it is my oracle in all my doubts That which before I have your advice I propose to myself with diffidence when once I have your approbation I make it a maxim Adieu my dearest friend On Wednesday I shall have the happiness to embrace you  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XXII MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  IT is done I have taken a long long leave of you perhaps for ever for my heart sinks within me and tells me I shall not live to hail your return do not chide me my dear my valuable friend pardon the weakness of a vulgar mind which feels no crosses lightly and falls flat to the earth at the very first stroke of adverse fortune perhaps in prosperity I should behave better and I do not think that happiness would make me insolent but in affiction I am less than nothing and that which would not leave a scratch upon the skin of a stoick pierces me to the heart if light evils wound me so deeply what  think you I must suffer from this great this remediless calamitya separation from you I have laid upon my wound all the balm that my small share of philosophy can administer but methinks my grief is to me in the place of my friend I possess it with a kind of sweetness and I am so fond of it that I should think it a second loss if I had it not to pass my time with  My uncle in his reception of me at my return seemed to accommodate his looks and behaviour to mine for my grief I confess made me silent unsociable and incapable of any conversation but with my own sad thoughts however when I reflected upon the respect and affection I owed my generous uncle I resolved to put a constraint upon myself and meet him at breakfast next morning with cheerfulness in my looks and language  Alas my dear Euphemia I was mistaken in the cause of my uncle's reservehe is offended with me I have lost his esteem doubtless he thinks me unworthy of the benefits he has bestowed upon me How then can I enjoy them with any satisfaction He has heard of my interview with Mr Harleyhe thinks me ungrateful designing falsehis cold looks his altered behaviour the hints he sometimes throws out stab me to the very heartOh what needed this new affliction to one already overwhelmed with distress Why did I not make him acquainted with all that has passed between Mr Harley and me I know you disapprove my conduct upon this occasion but I had not you to advise with at the time I remember in speaking of this affair you told me that concealment always implies something wrong it is true and apppearances are against me to be thought ungrateful capable of taking advantage of that independence which his goodness  bestowed on me and contrary to his willI cannot bear it I will be justified in his opinion and become once more dependant on his bounty  BUT this dear this affectionate this more than father shuns me and having already condemned me in his thoughts is unwilling to hear my defence before the servants and in company his behaviour though less tender is still polite but when we are left alone he is silent reserved and even stern and either retires to his own apartment or orders the carriage to take an airing without asking me to accompany him  He is this moment returned from one of these little excursions I will go to him he is alone in his library either he must acquit me of any design to offend him which Heaven knows is the truth or take back those gifts which by making me independent of him have  exposed me to his suspicions Oh that you were here to advise to direct me I think I know how you would act on such an occasion I will endeavour to imitate you you are all openness candour and sincerityso innocence should be and I am sure I have no wilful offence with regard to my uncle to charge myself with Well I will go I will speak to him I will act this humiliating part for surely nothing can be more so than conscious of innocence to have a character to defendbut I will delay no longerI go  This dreaded interview is over I found my uncle in his library he was reading he looked up on my entrance I asked if he was busy my countenance and the tone of my voice which partook I suppose of the perturbation of my heart affected him I believe for he answered with his usual sweetness 'not if you have any thing to say to me' and  rising drew a chair for me opposite to his  TILL I can remove the prejudices you have entertained against me I am  said I  unworthy to sit in your presence and far far unworthy of that affluence your lavish gifts have raised me to resume those gifts I beseech you Sir suffer me to return to my former dependance on your bounty and let my behaviour be the measure of your future generosity to me  'YOU are strangely moved' said my uncle looking earnestly on me 'What do you complain of Maria' 'I do not presume to complain Sir' replied I  but I lament the loss of your favour which is but too apparent from your altered behaviour to me  'ARE you conscious' said he  of having done any thing to give me cause of complaint against you  'I AM Sir' answered I  'THAT is honest' said he  well since you have got so far in your confession pray go on and let me have the whole  He spoke this with a half smile which gave me courage to proceed  'THE fault I have to confess Sir' said I  is my having received a letter from Mr Harley and answering it without communicating either his letter or my answer to you I have also seen him and this circumstance likewise I have concealed from you  'AND was this right' said my uncle a little sternly  'MY intention was not wrong Sir' replied I  The principles of good actions  interrupted my uncle  are good inclinations if you meant well how did it happen that you have acted ill  'YOU will be a judge Sir' said I  how far I have acted ill on this occasion if you will condescend to read the papers I have in my hands here is Mr Harley's letter to me and a copy of my answer to it  'GIVE them to me' said my uncle with some precipitation  I DID so he walked to the window and I could perceive that he read both the letters twice over with great attention He did not return them to me but threw them both upon the table and resuming his seat  'SO the son of my greatest enemy' said he peevishly  has made you a declaration of love You whom I have considered as my daughter and for whom I have the affection of a father  MY dear uncle' said I  my more than father Heaven is my witness I would rather die than offend you  I could not utter these words without tears He looked at me I thought kindly  You have read my answer to Mr Harley's letter Sir  pursued I  is there any thing in it which offends you  'WHY I cannot say' said he  that your letter is much amiss considering that you certainly were not displeased with his declaration  'DOES that appear Sir' said I  I think it does  replied he  NOw my dear Euphemia this surprised me you have read this letter do you think it will bear that inference I am sure I did not intend it should I was vexed I was confused I could not bear my uncle's looks which were fixed upon me I cast down my eyes and was silent  HE seemed to wait for some reply but finding I said nothing  'TAKING it for granted' said he  what you have as good as confessed that the addresses of my enemy's son are far from being unwelcome to you and that your heart is very very favourably disposed towards him  I ROSE up precipitately  'OH Sir' said I  I have not deserved this  my tears flowed fast I covered my face with my handkerchief  and curtseying without looking at him I was hastening out of the room  MY uncle rose up also and getting between me and the door took my hand and led me back to my chair he removed my handkerchief from my eyes and still holding my hand  NAY you must hear what I have more to say  said he and smiling repeated  taking it for granted that your heart is very favourably disposed towards this young man who is the son of my mortal enemy and who has himself offended me by presuming to declare a passion for you and endeavouring to engage you in a clandestine correspondence with him you whom I love whom I have considered as my daughter and from whom I might expect some returns of affection and even duty have I not reason to complain of you Maria for encouraging  pretensions which you knew I could never approve  I VENTURED to interrupt him here  DOES it appear Sir by my answer to his letter that I have encouraged his pretensions  said I  IT does not appear by your letter  said he  that you have discouraged them  He comes too near who comes to be denied  said a poet very skilful in these matters  and one denial it seems will not serve his turn else why is he continually hovering about my house in hopes of some opportunity of speaking to you  NOW this circumstance my dear Euphemia I was till then quite ignorant ofI blushedmy uncle observed  it  I do not wish to distress you Maria  said he  I pretend not to control your inclinationsyou are your own mistress I suspected that you had acted disingenuously with me and it was this notion which produced the coldness you complain of I have been too hasty in my conclusions I believe I do not perceive that you are much to blame in this business but I shall always think it a misfortune that the person nearest and dearest to me in the world should form connections with those I have most reason to hate  AT that moment Mr Greville was announcedI rose up and being unwilling to be seen in the disorder I then was I hurried out of the room saying only these few words to him  DEPEND upon it Sir you shall be satisfied with me I would not displease you for the world  I HAVE often observed my dear Euphemia that most persons consider less the reasons of what is proposed to them contrary to their inclinations than the motives which may have obliged the person who proposes them to make use of those reasons had I attended only to my uncle's motives for the disapprobation he expressed of Mr Harley's addresses to me I might have thought them rather unjustifiable but the reasons he brought to influence my conduct were unanswerable As my parent my friend my benefactor he had a right to my obedience which by having so nobly made me independent of his control is an effect of my will not of constraint and I could not disoblige him without being guilty of the highest ingratitude  I HESITATED not a moment in resolving to put an end to Mr Harley's hopes if he entertained any and to forbid him absolutely from seeking opportunities  to write or speak to me any more My first intention was to write to him but I found I could not please myself in the terms I was to use these appeared too harsh those not decisive enough I tore my letter and concluded that my best way was to engage Mr Greville to acquaint him with my intentions and to prevail upon him to desist from his pursuits  THIS seemed so happy a thought that I became composed enough to take my place at table without shewing in my countenance and behaviour any traces of the disorder I had been in so lately  I PERCEIVED that my uncle observed me heedfully and seemed pleased I found an opportunity to have a quarter of an hour's private conversation with Mr Greville to whom I related not without some confusion all that had passed in regard to Mr Harley and as  I knew he often saw him begged he would prevent my having any further disquiet upon his account  MR Greville promised to execute my commission for he acknowledged that I had no other part to act The next news I shall hear perhaps is that the poor youth is gone to the Indies Well what of that You are going to America can I think of that dreadful circumstance and suffer any meaner regrets to mix with so just so poignant an affliction Adieu  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XXIII MISS HARLEY IN CONTINUATION  MR Greville it seems soon met with an opportunity of delivering my message which he charged himself with two days ago and is this morning returned to give me an account of his commission he appeared affected with the gentle sorrow for so he phrased it with which Mr Harley received my absolute rejection of him it never rose to complaint said he much less to murmurings against your commands silent dejection and some halfsuppressed sighs and a promise faintly pronouncedthat he would obey you were all his answer  MR Greville really seemed moved himself when he repeated this so you see it is not so very difficult to make  philosophy feel compassion sometimes  I hope Sir John will now be satisfied with me  said I without taking notice of his pathetic description  'IF you had a little more sensibility' replied he  I should say you have shewn great heroism on this occasion but as it is I can only compliment you upon your prudence and good sense  I DO not think I have done any more than my duty  said I  which my uncle pointed out to me and when once one is assured of the skill of one's guide it is afterwards a pleasure to be led  'I AM not sure' replied Mr Greville gravely  that my good friend is quite right in all this the limits that part justice from wrong are not so well marked out but that we may pass them before we are aware Mr Harley is not answerable for his  father's faults and he has virtues that render him not unworthy even of you and that is saying a great deal  I WILL dispatch this letter to the post immediately my uncle keeps his chamber with a slight indisposition I shall be employed in sending to him all day My dear Euphemia I expect a letter from you every moment and would you think it I tremble at the very thoughts of receiving one lest it should fix the day of your departure Oh my friend my fortitude grows less every day I feel it does how shall I bear the loss of you but I will not wound you with my vain regrets Adieu  LETTER XXIV MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  NO my dear friend this letter will not fix the day of my departure which may perhaps be yet more distant than I imagined for the Bellenden family do not seem to have finished half their preparations yet They propose to set out in a very splendid style suitable to the rank the colonel will hold in the province and the taste the people of our colonies have as I am informed for expence I think I can perceive the colonel is only passive in these affairs that innate grandeur of soul which he possesses neither seeks nor needs the aid of outward shew  How shall I thank you my dear Maria for the unbounded generosity of your presents to me Your jeweller was with me this morning and in a few instants I was made so rich by your munificence that Mr Neville was struck with astonishment and seemed to doubt whether he was not in a dream Gratitude is the best virtue of the poor and that Heaven knows my heart is full of so full indeed that no words seem adequate to its feelings and were you present with me I could only thank you with a silent tear  I CANNOT express how much I admire you for being able to maintain so noble a conduct under your present trials and difficultiesI repeat it my friend trials for although you have not been pleased to open your whole heart to me yet that heart incapable of disguise displays itself even in the midst of all your delicate reserve Would I could congratulate as well as praise for I had rather see the virtue of my friend employed  in wisely using welldeserved prosperity than in nobly bearing unmerited distresses If Heaven hears my ardent prayers I shall yet be able to leave you in a more tranquil situation than you are at present Adieu  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER XXV  MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  YOU have a right to all occasions of doing good I think it therefore incumbent upon me to offer you one There is a young woman in my neighbourhood for whom I have a great esteem on account of her good sense and amiable qualities Some disappointments she has lately met with makes her very desirous to go abroad She will think herself happy to be about your person for she knows enough of your character to love and revere you with a kind of enthusiasm her history is briefly this  HER parents who were persons of genteel birth and education dying when she was very young left her wholly unprovided for to the charitable cares of an aunt who was a widow without children and in tolerable circumstances She bred up the little girl as her own gave her a good education and declared she would leave her all she was worth The merit of the girl and the dutiful and affectionate returns she made to her kindness made this disposing of her property seem not more an act of affection than justice The old gentlewoman being seized with a dangerous fit of sickness sent for an attorney in great practice here to make her will a man remarkable for his success in his profession by which being likewise very fortunate in the numerous legacies that have been bequeathed him he has made a very considerable fortune in a few years  THE old lady died and when the will was opened Mr D the attorney was to the astonishment of every one appointed her executor and sole heir to her fortune which was about two thousand poundsher onceloved neice being cut off with a shillingThis strange and unexpected reverse of fortune drew on a still more poignant affliction A young man who had courted her with the consent of his parents and to whom she was soon to have been married was ordered by them to see her no more He loved her and persisted in his resolution to marry her though at the hazard of losing the greatest part of his fortune by disobliging his father Poor Fanny though she loves him tenderly has had the generosity to give him a positive denial and to avoid his importunities and doubtful perhaps of her own resolution is anxiously desirous of leaving England When I mentioned recommending her to you  she was in transports If you approve of my proposal I will send her to London in the stagecoach under the care of our housekeeper a good matronly woman who has a great kindness for her with whose absence I must dispense for a few days that I may have the satisfaction of delivering her safe to your protection  I AM very uneasy about my uncle I am afraid he is going to have a severe attack of his old distemper the gout at present it is but slight yet he is more restless and impatient than usual I read to him continually but he does not seem to give much attention and often interrupts me to tell me that my voice is low and faint and that my spirits seem greatly depressed It may be so and sure I have cause so soon to be separated from the friend of my heart the companion of my youth my comfort in adversity and my example for virtue  MR Greville will have it that my uncle is not quite satisfied with his conduct towards young Mr Harley which doubtless said he was harsh if not unjust and yet if he was here so he is gone you see my Euphemia it is probable he would not alter it Now I cannot be of this opinion I am sure if my uncle thought he was wrong in this case he would make haste to be right bad men justify their faults the good amend them  I WAS obliged to lay down my pen being summoned to Sir John who was taken extremely ill The physicians were afraid the gout was getting into his stomach I have not been in bed these two nights my dear suffering uncle seeing me continually by his bedside expressed great uneasiness lest my health might suffer by so constant an attendance upon him and insisted upon my retiring to rest It was not possible for me to obey him so I kept out of  his sight yet without quitting his apartment  THIS morning when I approached his bed as if just come down from my own chamber he took notice that I looked very pale and said  He was afraid I had not slept well  He comforted me with an assurance that he was better and pressing my hand affectionately 'You are a good girl' said he  your whole conduct is of a piece I never will forget the generous sacrifice you have made me on a late occasion  I FELT my face all in a glow I was not able to make him any answer The physicians coming in relieved my confusion they pronounced him better and now being in some measure free from my racking apprehensions I really retired to my chamber and threw myself upon my bed Two hours sleep refreshed me so much that when I entered  my uncle's apartment again he perceived the alteration in my looks  I FOUND the servants had informed him that I had not been in bed for three nights he tenderly reproached me with the deceit I had practised upon him but added  that as he hoped for some rest himself tonight the physicians having ordered something to compose him he would never pardon me if I did not go to bed  MR Greville is come to pass a day or two here I left the two friends together and retired to my own apartment to have the pleasure of conversing with you my dear friend for when I am writing to you and relating all the little occurrences that help to vary the dull scene of my life I fancy you are present and I am talking to you Adieu however for a little time  I HAVE a strange and terrible circumstance to tell you my Euphemia which I shall never wholly lose the remembrance of and which as often as it is recollected will probably occasion the same horrors that I feel now  THIS evening when I went into my uncle's chamber to take leave of him for the night he told me he would take the draught that was ordered for him then that he might have the pleasure of taking it from my hands Accordingly after having read the label I poured the medicine into a cup and gave it into his hand in the very moment that he was raising it to his lips Martin came into the room and perceiving what my uncle was doing cried out with eyes all wild and staring and in a voice scarce articulate from the violence of his agitation  Hold Sir for Heaven's sake do not drink  'WHAT is the matter with the man' said my uncle 'are you mad'  YOU have not drank any of it have you Sir  said he eagerly taking the cup out of his master's hand  are you sure you have not  'WELL' replied my uncle  I have not and what then  'Heaven be praised' said the good old man  Why Sir if you had drank it you would have been dead by this time it is poison  'How poison' said my uncle astonished As for me I was near fainting and should have fallen to the ground if my dear uncle weak as he was had not raised himself up in his bed to support me in the mean time Mr Greville was examining the medicine  'I BELIEVE it is laudanum' said he  and sure enough you would as Martin says have been a dead man if you had taken this dose But pray my good friend  said he to Martin  how did it happen that you knew this  'SIR' said Martin  two moments since a man and horse came to the gate he must have rode hard indeed for the horse was all over in a foam  If your master has not yet drank the potion that was sent him by Mr Allen the apothecary this evening  said he  haste prevent him it is poison Allen will be here soon after me and explain  and he rode away instantly  MR Greville now congratulated my uncle on his escape who seemed touched with the sincerst gratitude to Heaven for his preservation and said some very kind things to Martin who had been under Providence the happy instrument of it  IT WAS some time before I could recover any degree of composure so greatly had I been affected by my uncle's danger He pressed me earnestly to go to bed but all inclination to sleep was vanished and I was resolved to sit up and hear what the apothecary had to say  I RETIRED however for a few moments to write you an account of this strange accident which was likely to have been so fatal a one both to him and me for I think I never should have forgiven myself for having though innocently administered the deadly draught to him  THESE illshaped letters and crooked lines are an effect of that agitation under which I still labour  SURE the apothecary must be come by this timeI am impatient to hear how this dreadful mistake happened For  the future I shall tremble to take their medicines for how can one be sure of their exactness Jenny tells me Mr Allen is this moment arrived  ONE IN THE MORNING  WELL my dear friend here I am in my own chamber without the least desire of going to bed to night Joy is as great an enemy to sleep as grief and I am overjoyed I own it You are surprisedyou are impatient to know what has happened to produce a sensation I am so little acquainted withso long unfelt and almost despaired of Take then things in order and share largely share in the satisfaction of your friend  MR Allen entered my uncle's apartment a moment after me his countenance retained the traces of the great perturbation he had been in  'HEAVEN be praised Sir' said he to his patient  that this mistake has had no other consequences than to make me for some hours the most wretched man in the world    I can easily conceive the fright you have been in  said Sir John  but prithee Allen how did it happen that you sent me this fatal dose  'SIR' replied the apothecary  a patient of mine a gentlewoman in years is accustomed to take small doses of laudanum every night she is miserable if it is not always at hand so I generally send her two ounces at a time I had prepared your draught and wrote the labels for both the phials when a servant of a dear friend of mine who lived about a quarter of a mile distant came to tell me that I must go instantly and bleed his master who was in an apoplectic fit  MY journeyman who had always been remarkably diligent and careful in his business was just ready to mount on horseback to take your medicine to the Hall I gave him the label and shewing him the phial bid him tie it on and set out with it immediately and I hastened to relieve my friend My man who during the five years that he has lived with me never made any mistake of this kind before took the phial which contained the laudanum put the label on it designed for your draught and rode away  WHEN I came home about an hour afterwards I discovered the dreadful mistake the draught designed for you being still on the counter I concluded that the other was by this time delivered and probably taken I was almost distracted having no horse but that my journeyman rode on I determined to set out on foot for the Hall  but however anxiety and terror might have quickened my pace I must have come too late when a gentleman alighting at my door desired me to dress his hand which by some accident he had cut dreadfully I answered that it was impossible that Sir John Harley was in danger of being poisoned by a mistake of my man who had carried him a large dose of laudanum instead of the prescription I had prepared for him Saying this I rushed by him scarce knowing what I did  THE gentleman instantly remounted his horse and putting him in full gallop cried out to me as he passed by me that he would be at the Hall in less than ten minutes and hoped to prevent the mischief Then and not before I recollected who he was    And who is he  said my uncle eagerly  The reverend Dr Harley's son  replied Mr Allen  I know him very well  My uncle hearing this name clasped his hands together with great emotion and casting his eyes first upon Mr Greville then on me with a look big with meaning he turned himself about in his bed and continued silent His piercing glance at me filled me I know not how with confusion I felt my face covered with blushes I could not look at Mr Greville who exclaimed two or three times in a transported accent'Generous noble fellow What think you of this my friend said he to Sir John approaching his bed My uncle made him no answer but I thought I heard him sigh deeply  Mr Greville then observing that Mr Allen must be greatly fatigued with so long a walk in such agitation of mind and indeed the poor man looked like a ghost desired him to walk into the next room where he would find something to refresh him and in the mean time he  would give directions for a horse to be saddled to carry him home  Mr Allen withdrew and Martin appearing upon Mr Greville's ringing the bell my uncle interrupted the orders he was giving to ask him eagerly if he knew the person who brought the message from the apothecary  'YES Sir' said Martin  it was Mr Harley  And why did you not tell us this circumstance  said my uncle Martin cast down his eyes  How did he look what did he say to you  asked my uncle  HE seemed to be in great agitation Sir  replied Martin  his horse was all in a foam and himself seemed almost breathless  "Has your master' said he  taken the medicine that Mr Allen sent here this morning  I replied No  Fly prevent him it is poison  said he  the apothecary is following me he will explain the mistake  The porter has since told me that he rode away instantly and that he thought he was wounded for his handkerchief was bound round his left hand and seemed covered with blood  My uncle then bid Martin go and attend Mr Allen when Mr Greville repeating  WHAT think you of all this my friend  'I THINK' replied Sir John  that this young man is the noblest of all human beings My life stood between him and an ample fortune and what is more between him and a blessing which he sets perhaps a much  higher value upon Yet has he saved that life with the hazard of his own and done as much for his enemy as he would have done for his father  Then pausing a little  And a father I will be to him now  added he  from this moment I will consider him as my son Why is he not here that I may embrace and call him so  My uncle spoke this in so affectionate a manner as moved even the lively Mr Greville  'WHERE shall I find him' pursued he  who will bring him to me that wound in his hand alarms me I feel already the anxiety of a father for him  Then looking at me with a tender smile  'MARIA' said he  will not I hope be jealous of this newsprung affection for a person so worthy  I was silent for what indeed could I say Mr Harley's merits are too great for  praisefor my poor praise My uncle seemed to have a just sense of them and for this I could not but rejoice  Mr Greville who sat musing for some time at last said  The appearance of young Harley in these parts surprises me I know he took leave of his family a week ago in order to go on board theIndiaman which I thought had failed by this time Perhaps I may get some intelligence from Allen I'll go to him  He did so and returned again in a quarter of an hour during which time my uncle and I had not spoke a word to each other  'ALLEN tells me' said Mr Greville  that he met Mr Harley when he had got about half way to the Hall He called out to him in a joyful tone and told him all was safe He complained of the hurt in his hand and said he would stop at his house and  get his journeyman if he was come home to put some dressings upon it  Mr Allen begged he would stay till he came back if he did not find his man at home Mr Harley replied  that he had not a moment to spare that he was going to hire a postchaise at the RoseInn and intended to travel all night being apprehensive that the ship would fail without himhis father's sudden illness having detained him longer than he expected  'So then' interrupted my uncle in a tone of deep distress 'he is gone'  'No no I hope not' replied Mr Greville  I have dispatched Allen on horseback with directions if he finds the youth at his house as I doubt not but he will to tell him that he must not stir from thence till I have seen him which shall be early in the morning Allen can accommodate him with a bed  'THIS will not do' cried my uncle vehemently  this voyage must be prevented or I shall never enjoy a quiet moment Bid Martin get on horseback instantly and if he does not find Harley at Allen's let him go on with all speed to the RoseInn Dear Greville hasten him mean time I will write a line myself to Harley Maria give me pen ink and paper  MY uncle's impetuosity put us all in motion Mr Greville hastened to give Martin his orders I brought my uncle what he desired he sat up in his bed and made shift to scrawl a few lines Here is is a copy of them  TO MR HARLEY  WORTHY young man you have saved my life but if you would not embitter the remainder of it think no more of your voyage to India return  with my messenger and expect for the future to find a father an affectionate father in  JOHN HARLEY  Mr Greville inclosed this note in one from himself and Martin who seemed excessively pleased with his commission assured us he would not return without the blessed young gentleman that had preserved his master  SIR John seemed now quite exhausted with the different agitations his mind had suffered this evening and a few minutes after Martin's departure fell into a profound sleep I wished Mr Greville a good night and retired to my chamber where I have ever since been employed in writing to you  Mr Greville told me at parting that he would sit up an hour or two longer  in expectation of Martin's return who if he is not here by that time said he we may conclude he did not meet Harley at Allen's and is gone after him to the inn  WELL we may now conclude that Martin has not succeeded for he might have been here long ere this time I hear Mr Greville crossing the gallery to go to his own chamber so he has given up all hope He calls to me as he passes by my door seeing a light still in my chamberSure he has heard some news  THIS is what Mr Greville told me through the door for I would not open it being all undressed  MARTIN has sent a man home with the horse he rode out with and in a note to Mr Greville informs him that Mr Harley had called at Allen's and got his hand dressed which he had hurt  by a fall from his horse and immediately afterwards set out for the inn Thither Martin followed and hearing that Mr Harley was gone away a quarter of an hour before in a postchaise he thought he could not do a more acceptable piece of service to his master than to follow him and endeavour to overtake him accordingly he ordered posthorses and a guide and was just ready to set out when his messenger came away Mr Greville added in a melancholy accent that he feared all this would end at last in disappointment and regret Indeed I fear so too and am in pain for my uncle who will be most sensibly afflicted so now my dear Euphemia being not too happy to sleep I will wish you a good night and retire to bed  LETTER XXVI MISS HARLEY IN CONTINUATION  I ROSE early this morning and had the satisfaction to hear that my uncle had had a good night and was still asleep Mr Greville being also up and in my uncle's library I joined him there He was beginning to rally me on the subject of Mr Harley but presently altered his tone being strongly apprehensive that the youth would be on board and the ship failed before Martin could overtake him  'Poor fellow' said he with a sigh  he is too good to be a favourite with Fortune who seldom bestows any  thing upon the virtuous because she knows she cannot bribe them with her gifts  MY uncle having sent to desire we would drink our chocolate by his bedside we attended him immediately He was very low spirited having heard from his valet that Martin was not returned Mr Greville read his billet to him which was not calculated to remove his fears of the bad success of his expedition He was full of uneasy reflections he railed at fortune he railed at himself but still he was more inclined to find fault with his stars than himself  MR Greville put him in mind of the great danger he had so lately escaped by means so unlikely and unexpected  'YES' replied my uncle  my life is preserved but he who preserved it is out of the reach of my gratitude which will be a continual source of  vexation and regret to me The favours I receive  pursued he in a peevish tone  are so husbanded that I cannot recover an eye but by losing a leg my causes of complaint never cease they only change their places  WE have had a melancholy day of it I never saw my uncle so fretful and impatient he recals every circumstance to his mind that is likely to increase his remorse for his unkindness to Mr Harley He reprobates his own churlish conduct at the inn where he first saw him and received so strong a proof of the generosity and sweetness of his disposition which I repaid said he by a tyrannous exertion of the power I had to make him miserable I must ever despise and hate myself for it  'COME come' said Mr Greville  we must not suffer you to be too severe a censurer of yourself a man shews himself greater by being capable  of owning a fault than by being incapable of committing it  'I WOULD repair that fault' replied my uncle impatiently  and fortune puts it out of my powerit is this that makes me wretched  His physician was surprised when he visited him today to find him so much worse He said he had a considerable degree of fever he seemed unwilling to take any medicines telling him the danger he had escaped which he could not do without sighing deeply several times  DR Irwin told him he would carry his prescriptions himself to the apothecary see them made up and send them by one of his own servants and this expedient has made us easy on that head But as we have no tidings yet of Martin and my uncle apparently suffers in his health from the inquietude of his mind we are under great apprehensions on his account Mr Greville utterly  condemns his too great sensibility on this occasion The best virtues he told him when in excess partake so much of vice that even extreme right is no better than extreme wrong My uncle answered peevishly that his philosophy was very unseasonable and turning himself in his bed seemed as if he was desirous of taking some rest but I really believe he sought only to indulge his melancholy reflections without interruption  MR Greville walked into the garden and I retired to my chamber and wrote thus far I am now going down to make him some tea No news of Martin yet  AT NIGHT  MR Greville being obliged to visit a friend in our neighbourhood today I have been reading the whole evening to my uncle in order to detach his  thoughts from the subject of his uneasiness His friend is now with him he tells him that Martin's not returning is a good sign for if he had not had hopes of overtaking Mr Harley he would have been back ere now There is some probability in this but my uncle is so out of humour with himself that he admits of nothing which may tend to relieve his disquiet  WHAT an enormous packet you will receive this time but I am willing to keep it open while our suspense continues that you may either rejoice or grieve with us for the event I wish yet dread to have a letter from youyour next will probaby fix the very moment of your departure It is late and with this sad expectation on my mind I will go to bed I cannot say to rest  WELL my dear Euphemia Martin is returned Has he brought back Mr  Harley you ask he has but not to us This morning as I was going into my uncle's chamber I met Mr Greville who beckoning to me to come to one of the gallery windows which looked out into the courtyard shewed me Martin just arrived alone and looking melancholy We were in doubt whether we should let him see my uncle immediately till we had prepared him for the ill news he brought But he who had already been informed that he was come rang his bell impetuously upon which we both went into his chamber  'So' said he as soon as he saw us  Martin is come and alone it seems it is as I expected Did ever any thing happen according to my wish  MARTIN coming in put a stop to these fretful complaints but as it should seem he was afraid to ask him any questions for he said not a word  to him Upon which Mr Greville said  I am sorry to see you are come alone friend  'I AM sorry too Sir' replied Martin 'and Mr Harley hopes Sir' addressing himself to his master  when you know his reasons you will have the goodness to excuse him  'YOU have seen him then' cried my uncle impatiently  and he has refused to come well I might have expected this But did he receive my invitation with disdaindid he express any bitterness against me  'OH Sir' said Martin  I wish you could have seen with what respect he received your Honour's letter At the very first words he read of it his face seemed all in a glow He read it over I believe twenty times and kissing it respectfully before he put it in his pocket I observed his eyes full  of tears I ventured to say to him May I hope Sir you will lay aside all thoughts of your intended voyage and return with me to the Hall  "CAN you doubt it my good friend" said he "if you were not so much fatigued as I see you are I would this moment set out with you for I shall think every moment an age till I can throw myself at the feet of your noble master to thank him for the unmerited goodness he expresses for me in this letter" He then took it out of his pocket again and read it over half a dozen times I believe  'BUT why is he not here' interrupted my uncle with his usual impatience 'where is hewhen shall I see him'  'SIR' replied Martin  he is gone to his father's  'How' interrupted my uncle  gone to his fathers'  'OH Sir' resumed Martin  the poor young gentleman heard the most melancholy piece of news when he came to the RoseInn last night where we only stopped till fresh horses were put to the chaise I walked out with him into the innyard to hasten them when a country fellow espying him camerunning up to him crying "Master Harley I am glad to see you faith What you have heard the sad news then But you must make haste I can tell you that or you will not see your father alive he was just giving up the ghost when I came from and that is five or six hours ago"  'OH Sir' pursued Martin wiping his eyes  I shall never forget the sad condition poor young Harley was in I had just time to catch him in my arms where he lay without sense or  motion for several minutes As soon as he recovered he begged me with his eyes all drowned in tears to tell you the sad circumstances he was in and then eagerly throwing himself into the chaise which was now ready he bid the postboy drive with all the speed he could to He just pronounced your Honour's name and would have added something but a violent burst of grief stopped his voice he fell all along the feat sighing as if his heart would break and the chaise driving away furiously he was presently out of sight I was obliged to stay several hours after him not being able to get any conveyance here till five o'clock this morning  YOU will easily imagine my dear Euphemia that we were all greatly affected with this sad tale I wept I own it my uncle discovered great emotion and Mr Greville walked to the window in a pensive mood  MY uncle after a silence of some minutes told Martin he would allow him this day to rest himself after his fatigue and that tomorrow he must set out early for Dr Harley'sThe post is just going out I shall have only time to make up my packet Adieu then my dear Euphemia  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XXVII MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  SIR John is so well recovered that he took an airing this morning in his chariot Mr Greville has left us and Martin is dispatched to Dr Harley's with a kind message to the afflicted family and his pocketbook stuffed with bank bills for Mr Harley and a short billet in which my uncle earnestly requests him to come to the Hall as soon as he possibly can His health seems to improve every moment Joy is a great restorative Yet he now and then breathes a halfsuppressed sigh  to the memory of his onceloved friend whose offences towards him could only it seems be cancelled by death  MARTIN is returned Dr Harley lived two hours after the arrival of his beloved son He was perfectly sensible and Mr Harley had the comfort to remove his anxiety for the future fortunes of the young family he left behind him by acquainting him with the happy change in Sir John's disposition towards him  THE family are in great affliction Mr Harley has wrote a few lines to my uncle which seem to please him greatly He did not read them to me but this was his observation upon them  This young man  said he  receives a benefit with the same grace with which he confers one His gratitude loses nothing of its force by the dignity of his  expression  Why have I not a letter from you Yet when it comes I shall fear to break the seal left it should tell me what I dread to know Adieu  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XXVIII MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  I RETURNED last night from another visit to Lord L's I could not resolve to leave England without visiting once more the place where the dear remains of my mother are deposited As I was leaving the church I met Mr Neville who was just arrived at Lord L's seat in order to conduct me home and hearing to whatplace I was gone came himself to fetch me My mind softened by the tender melancholy ideas which the sight of my loved mother's tomb inspired was so sensibly affected with the obliging solicitude of my husband that I flew to meet him with a transport which was instantly repressed by the austerity  of his looks and the harshness of his reproofs for the indulgence of a grief which he treats almost as a crime There is no doubt but he meant well and this severity was an effect of his concern for me but he has so little delicacy is so ungracious that he converts even the best intentions into offences by his unfortunate manner of expressing them  THIS meeting therefore as you may well imagine did not contribute to calm my mind I came home sufficiently mortified and dejected but the society of my dear Mrs Benson her wise reasonings and tender soothings restored me to some degree of tranquillity  YOU have made me a most acceptable present in the young person who has the honour to be recommended by you Oppression has ever been in my opinion a sufficient ground for protection  but the testimony you give of her merit and her own engaging appearance and manner will secure her a large share of my kindness and esteem Her situation with me shall in every respect be made as agreeable to her as you would wish Mrs Benson is much pleased with her she is her bedfellow and they are very seldom asunder  I HAVE got your second packet my hopes my wises my expectations are answeredyou will be the wife of Mr Harley Excellent young man but he is as you justly observe above all praise He is worthy of you my friend lovely as you are in person and mind  SIR John Harley's character rises greatly upon me in your agreeable narrativehe has acted both a just and a generous part You have painted him with great force I see him in all the turns and changes of his temper and in  every view he is pleasing Your gay philosopher your lively yet sententious Mr Greville was in my opinion much to blame when he placed the most amiable virtue of the mind in the number of its maladies and infirmities Sir John's sensibility is certainly very great and if it be necessary as some have said that limits and bounds should be set in all cases they cannot be unfit in acts of acknowledgment If there be a fault opposite to ingratiude he has fallen into it and thus by the excess he has avoided the defect but the defect is so horrid and the excess so beautiful that he must be a rigid moralist indeed who calls it an infirmity  AND now my dear Maria that I see you possessed of so much happiness at present and so much greater in prospect I shall with the less reluctance tell you that our ship will absolutely sail within these ten days All the fortitude I can boast would have been  scarce sufficient to have supported my spirits under this separation if I had left you in that uneasy state of mind which your delicacy but half unveiled but which your candor and amiable simplicity made but too apparent to an observation interested like mine  YES my dear friend you have loved Mr Harley all this time and your gentle mind has had some severe conflicts to sustain between your inclination for him and the obedience you owed Sir John who as your uncle and benefactor had a double title to it The virtues of Mr Harley have made this sacrifice no longer necessary and that which justifies your choice secures you the possession of its object  I EARNESTLY intreat you my Maria not to suffer the present sunshine of your fortune to be clouded with your apprehensions for me Our separation is the only circumstance that ought to give  you some concern and that is common to us both It is true I have but little contentment but what I derive from reason and philosophy that sort of philosophy I mean which teaches us submismision to the will of Heaven I see nothing terrible in this long voyage but my absence from you I apprehend nothing worse than what has already happened to me and I will never believe that ill fortune will follow me so far or that it is possible for one to fall who already stands so low You may render absence tolerable to me by frequent letters Continue your charming narratives while I read your lively descriptions I see I converse with youI partake your fears I am elevated with your hopes I sympathise with your sorrows and enjoy your happiness  AS for me it will be the chief comfort of my life to write to you and make you acquainted with all the events of it I propose to devote some part of  every day to this dear  converse  I will call it which will make you present with me and although I cannot hope to give you equal entertainment yet I will be punctual if not liberal and send you that which I promised if I cannot send you what I would Adieu  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER XXIX MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MR Greville is just come from Dr Harley's afflicted family where he has been to pay a consolatory visit He has brought a letter from Mr Harley to my uncle which he keeps to himself I am extremely glad that the youth in accepting my uncle's liberal present discovers nothing of that pride of spirit which appeared in that letter of his to me upon a former occasion I mentioned this circumstance to Mr Greville as what had given me some apprehensions  'YOU are right' said he  for nothing is more likely to create distrust in  a new reconciliation than to shew a shyness to be obliged to those with whom we are reconciled But Harley you know is now his son by adoption and no I think of it  pursued he with a sly leer  you are too just not to have this worthy young man's interest extremely at heart would it not be more for his advantage think you for Sir John to call him his nephew than his son  I BLUSHED like a fool but recollecting myself I answered himgravely  that he had acted like a father by me who was only his niece and that whichsoever of those characters he chose to consider Mr Harley in I did not doubt but he would shew himself equally affectionate  I WAS afraid of the archness I saw rising in his looks therefore to prevent his mischievous raillery I asked him a great many questions concerning Mrs Harley  and the young ladies and he let me into a secret which surprised me greatly Mrs Harley was it seems bred up by her mother in the Roman Catholic religion and although obliged on account of her husband's profession to conceal her principles while he lived yet being a bigot to its tenets she is determined to spend the remainder of her days in a convent in France where she proposes to complete the education of her daughters I believe this scheme will meet with some opposition from Sir John who I know intends to take care of them  ToDAY at dinner my uncle told me that he expected a visit from Mr Harley in a day or two and he desired me to give orders to the housekeeper to prepare that apartment for him which was formerly mine for since Lady Harley's death I have by his express command occupied her's I answered hesitatingly 'Yes Sir' for both the  gentlemen threw me into such confusion by their fascinating looks that I scarce knew what I said  AS soon as the cloth was removed I retired to my own apartment instead of giving the housekeeper orders myself I bid my maid tell her her master wanted her She received his directions and came to tell me with great joy that we were to have Mr Harley for a guest  WE are all debtors to this charming young gentleman  said she  for the life of our good master  NOW my dear Euphemia no one has a higher sense of this obligation than I have but my situation is a little aukward Mr Greville's raillery and my uncle's fixed looks on me which seem as if they were exploring the inmost recesses of my heart often distress me greatlyI escape from them when I can  I AM summoned this moment to make tea I wish Mr Greville was goneI never thought his company tiresome before Do you not think it is indelicate in him my Euphemia to pursue me thus with his raillerySo a second summonsI must go  SIR John and his friend imagined a fine scheme to divert themselves with my embarrassment Who do you think I saw upon my returning to the room where I had left them togetherEven Mr Harley whom I had been taught not to expect these two days But this mischievous design did not succeed entirely to their wish for although my surprise was indeed very great at this unexpected sight of him yet I felt my confusion decrease in proportion as the tender melancholy in his looks fixed my attention upon the recent cause  A TRANSIENT blush overspread his cheeks on my first appearance but  instantly gave place to that paleness which the death of a father whom he had loved excessively seemed to have planted there  HE approached me with an air of deep respect but with a sedateness which he borrowed from his melancholy situation and made me a short compliment which I received and answered without any other emotion than what arose from a participation in a grief so just and so affecting He led me to my chair and resuming his seat which was next my uncle he continued his discourse upon some indifferent matters which my coming in had interrupted  SIR John and Mr Greville were evidently disappointed that this first interview had passed over without any of that discomposure which would have laid a foundation for some future raillery I enjoyed their disappointment I confess and saw with some little triumph Mr  Greville's arch looks and my uncle's significant glances give place to a seriousness which was better suited to the circumstances of our young guest  THE evening passed over very agreeably my uncle seemed delighted with Mr Harley's conversation for although he was far from making an oftentatlous display of his powers of pleasing yet through all his modesty there appeared a fund of knowledge and an elegance of expression which captivated the attention and gave an advantageous idea of his understanding and improvements  HE took occasion once to mention his great obligations to my uncle he employed but few words for he seemed well aware of the justness of that observation that the dignity of truth is wounded by much professing but his look and accent were so affecting that Sir John seemed touched to the soul  and grasping his hand with an eager pressure  'TALK not to me of obligations' said he  your worth outstrips all my power of rewarding  MR Greville was cruel enough at that moment to cast a glance full of meaning at me to add to the confusion with which I was overwhelmed I perceived as soon as I was able to look up that this mischievous look had not escaped Mr Harley's observation his face was covered by a deep blush With a timid and disconcerted air he raised my uncle's hand which still held his fast clasped to his lips and told him in a low but ardent accent that it should be the business of his life to deserve his good opinion  OUR common persecutor now seemed to pity the embarrassment he had occasioned and instantly began a conversation on indifferent matters  I RETIRED early to my own apartment to be at liberty to continue my letter to you It was late and I was still engaged in this dear employment when Mrs Groves who had carried the candle before Mr Harley when he retired to his chamber where she left him with Martin who was ordered to attend him came into my room and begging pardon for her intrusion broke into the most extravagant praises of the young gentleman  THIS good woman loves to talk and says every thing that comes into her head without regarding time or place or persons and she is indulged in this liberty on account of her longtried rectitude and fidelity  'DO you know Madam' said she  that I have found out that there is a great likeness between you and Mr Harley He has the very air of your countenance your fine large eyes  said  the flatterer  and dimpled mouth only his complexion is not like yours his is a lovely brown and yours to be sure is as fair as alabaster I think he resembles you too in the air of his personno disparagement to you neither Madam for I think he is one of the genteelest young men I ever saw  WELL but I must tell you something Madam You must know that as we passed through that room which was formerly your dressingroom your picture that hangs over the chimney took his eye in a minute well what did he do but with great eagerness he takes one of the candles out of my hand goes up close to it and there he stood looking and looking as if he could never be tired So I made bold to say Sir that is my young lady's picture it was drawn when she was about fourteen do you think it is like her  'IT is like your young lady' said he  but she is vastly improved since this was painted  WELL Madam he staid looking and looking at it so long till I was downright tired with standing at last he begged my pardon and returned me the candle and as sure as you are alive Madam he fetched a deep sigh when he took his eyes off it  'WELL Mrs Groves' said I smiling  what is all this to the purpose  'WHY Madam' replied she  what I  refer  from all this is that Mr Harley has certainly a great kindness for you and that you would make a charming couple  NOW my dear Euphemia I do not doubt but the wise assembly of the housekeeper's room have settled already all the preliminaries of this match and  as good as concluded upon it I was unwilling to hear any more upon the subject so I called my maid to assist me in undressing and bade the loquacious housekeeper good night  AND a thousand thousand times good night to you my dear friend whom I always see in my dreams but with melancholy omens for alas you are torn from me the distance between us seems to increase and sometimes I lose fight of you entirely But sure we shall meet again do you not think we shall I must I will indulge this hope for without it I shall be miserable  LETTER XXX MISS HARLEY IN CONTINUATION  MR Harley has left us and I am just escaped from that unceasing teazer Mr Greville to give my dear Euphemia an account of what has passed during this interesting day  AT breakfast my uncle asked Mr Harley if it would be inconvenient to him to stay another day The youth replied that a longer absence at this time would be severely felt by his afflicted family  WELL then you shall go my dear Edward  said my uncle  my horses  and groom shall attend you unless you choose to have the postchariot  Mr Harley thanked him and said as the day was fair he would rather ride  'YOU will reach' said my uncle  before dark though you do not set out these two hours therefore  pursued he rising  as I wish to have a little discourse with you in private before you leave us I will expect you in my library as soon as you have finished your breakfast  MR Harley who rose up when my uncle did told him he was ready to attend him then and accordingly followed him after bowing to me with an air so timid and embarrassed as threw me I know not why into confusion likewise  I DURST not raise my eyes to Mr Greville who I supposed was making his malicious observations so both of  us continued ridiculously silent for several minutes when he thought fit to relieve me by desiring me to give him another dish of tea I did so and he then asked me gravely if I could guess what was likely to be the subject of Sir John's conversation with Mr Harley  I TOLD him I really could not  AND have you no curiosity about it  said he  'NOT much' I answered  'NOT much' repeated he  this indifference is not very obliging to Mr Harley  'YOU are mistaken Sir' replied I  I am not indifferent to any thing that concerns Mr Harley his interests will always be of some consequence to me esteeming him so justly as I do But I have no anxiety on my mind  on account of this private conference and therefore little curiosity because I have no doubt of the greatness and permanency of my uncle's affection for him as it is founded upon his merit and the grateful sense he has of his obligations to him  THE openness of my answer disconcerted Mr Greville who I perceived expected I should say something that would give him an opportunity of teazing me as was his custom He looked at me I thought with complacency and that moment my uncle called out  Greville  'Now' said he rising to go to him  I shall know all and to punish you for your reserve I will not tell you a word of what I know  'YES you will' replied I laughing  when I have curiosity enough to ask you  HE went to my uncle and I took my usual walk upon the terrace where in about half an hour afterwards I was joined by Mr Greville and Mr Harley There was something in the countenance of the latter so full of meaning that I knew not whybut I could neither look at nor speak to him He was silent too and in this stupid way we followed Mr Greville who led us from one walk to another pointing out to Mr Harley somewhat or other to admire in the disposition of the grounds which you know are laid out in the most beautiful taste imaginable  ALL on a sudden he seemed to recollect something he had to say to Sir John and telling us he would be with us again in a few minutes left us together  THIS silly contrivance of leaving me alone with Mr Harley was not calculated to lessen that unaccountable embarrassment  into which his coming had thrown me I was impatient to free myself from this aukward situation and therefore pretending to be apprehensive that it would rain I mended my pace in order to get as soon as possible into the house but he respectfully retaining me begged me not to have the cruelty to deprive him of the only opportunity he had yet had of speaking to me alone I then walked slower but still towards the house though he sought to turn my steps to another path  'THE tide of favour here' said he  flows so strongly for me as might indeed carry my hopes very far did not your coldness Madam or rather aversion reduce me to despair  'MY aversion' said I  Mr Harley how can you imagine that I have any aversion to youyou who have so just a right to my esteem  AND am I honoured with your esteem Madam  replied he eagerly  and may I presume to hope that the tender the ardent passion with which you inspired me the first moment I beheld you is not displeasing to you Speak I conjure you Madam  pursued he  relieve me from this agony of doubtsuffer me not to depart uncertain of my fate  BEING still out of sight of the house he threw himself at my feet holding one of my hands which he several times pressed to his lips in spite of my endeavours to withdraw it  THIS liberty was not altogether agreeable any more than the parade of his posture still kneeling I moved a step back and laughing as I did once before on the same occasion told him that I supposed he had lately read Cassandra and the grand Cyrus for his language  and manners had all the air of an Orondates  I CONFESS to you my dear Euphemia that I was willing to relieve the embarrassment this very passionate address had thrown me into by a little raillery which detached my reflexions upon the silly figure I must have made during this short scene but I was much concerned when I perceived the effect my illjudged gaiety had upon him He dropped my hand submissively and rising bowed low asking me pardon for the liberty he had taken in declaring his sentiments so freely He was now convinced he said that my indifference or rather dislike of him was not to be overcome that he could have borne my anger with more fortitude than my scorn by which his presumption was too severely punished to leave him an excuse for ever repeating his offence  I HEARD him sighI saw his eyes full of tears I was shocked perplexedI knew not what to say to him I am sure my heart was far from being in that disposition towards him which he seemed to apprehend Scorn good Heaven Mr Harley an object of scorn how could a thought so injurious to his acknowledged merit rise in his mind I wished to erase it but nothing proper to be said recurred to my mind  I CONTINUED silent and without attending to what I did walked fast towards the house Doubtless he understood this to be in consequence of my eagerness to get rid of him for again I heard him sigh deeply but he spoke not a word  MR Greville who was come out again joined us before either of us perceived him He seemed surprised and vexed at the disorder that appeared in  Mr Harley's countenance it was indeed sufficiently apparent for at that moment I ventured to cast my eyes upon him but instantly removed them again being I own it greatly affected by the tender distress expressed in every line of his face  MR Greville who heedfully observed us both cast an upbraiding glance on me and being now arrived at the house he said to Mr Harley I intend to accompany you a few miles the horses are at the gateI believe we shall find Sir John there likewise  MR Harley then made me a most respectful bow but uttered not a word nor raised his eyes to my face I curtseyed also in silence though I am sure I secretly wished him a good journey and retired to my own apartment where I have been ever since  I HAVE a most oppressive weight upon my spirits I dread seeing Mr Greville againI hate his scrutinizing looks but I must resolve to meet them for my maid tells me that dinner is ready to be served and that Mr Greville is returned from his ride Why did he return I think he takes root hereWell I must go  MY uncle looked very grave upon me all dinnertime Mr Greville was serious and reserved  WHEN I drank my uncle's health he took no other notice of me than by a bow lower than usual without his wonted smile of complacency Just as I was rising from table my maid brought me a letter from you I took it out of her hand with a visible emotion I suppose for the gentlemen smiled I asked leave to retire to read it and without waiting for an answer flew up stairs  OH my Euphemia what do you tell me a few days more and I shall be separated from you perhaps for ever Have I so anxiously wished for this letter which when it came was to pierce my heart with its fatal tidings Do not chide me my dear friend this stroke though long expected falls heavy on me I must lay down my pen my tears blind me when I am more composed I will finish my letter  I have passed a sleepless night  Thought followed thought and tear succeeded tear  But I am now if not easy yet resigned since to remediless evils nothing but patience can be opposed But be assured neither time nor absence will be able to weaken my affectionYour idea will always be present with me I shall dream continually of you and find no image in my memory so pleasing as that which presents me the time of  our being together You shall have letters from me by every conveyance and thus though oceans roll between us our minds may often meet and converse with each other  YOUR picture travels continually from one room to another whereever I am likely to spend most of my time thither it is removed but this is not sufficient I would have you always near me I conjure you then my dear friend sit immediately to for a miniature You will still have time enough if you set about it instantly When the painter has done his part send it to my jeweller he has some diamonds of mine unemployed I will write to him and give him directions I dispatch this pacquet to the post without staying to consider some things in your last letter which have given my thoughts a good deal of employment Adieu my dear Euphemia  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XXXI MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  I HAVE loved Mr Harley all this time you say my dear Euphemia and this circumstance which has hitherto been a secret to myself you have it seems discovered from my first mention of him I will not call your penetration in question nor will you I am sure doubt my candour when I declare that the sentimental entertained for Mr Harley and which I freely avowed to you appeared to me to be such as every friend to virtue must feel for one so duly virtuous  YOU call him an excellent young man and so he certainly is It was natural to wish well to the worth I esteemedto feel for his situation and to be anxious for his prosperity I never thought it necessary to question my own heart about the nature of sentiments which appeared to me so reasonable and so just  I REMEMBER a saying that once fell from you  A young woman has passed over the first bounds of reservedness who allows herself to think she is in love  Nor would your delicacy have permitted you to speak so plainly to me on this subject if you had not supposed that from the great and just degree of favour Mr Harley is now in with my uncle his pretensions to me will be authorised by his consent without it I am sure however favourably I might think of him he could never have hoped for success  BUT although according to you my  inclinations  and duty are now reconciled you are not likely to leave me so happy as you imagined for my uncle is offended Mr Greville reproaches me and Mr Harley perhaps hates me and all these misfortunes I have drawn upon myself with the most innocent intentions imaginable  SOME time ago I suffered in my uncle's opinion for being willing to do justice to the merits of this young man when I thought he was harshly used and I was suspected of favouring addresses from the son of his ancient enemy and now he reproaches me with caprice and a tyrannical use of my power over a person whom he loves and esteems and to whom he has the highest obligations In the former case I shewed a ready obedience to his will by giving Mr Harley an absolute rejection in the latter whatever my sentiments were with regard to him I  thought myself obliged to act with great reserve till my uncle was pleased to declare his intentions to me Mr Greville calls my conduct in this instance a too scrupulous prudence which does nothing for fear of doing ill "Your uncle's prejudices said he have all given way to the conviction of his better judgment for sensible persons only taste of an error of which the ignorant drink till they are intoxicated You could not my dear Miss Harley be ignorant what designs Sir John entertained in favour of Mr Harley Why then treat him with a coldness that saddened all his delightful prospects" And he was angry with me in good earnest for sending his young friend as he calls Mr Harley away in despair  IT is no unpleasant thing to see a philosopher in choler I only smiled at his reproaches though I could easily have justified myself He was malicious enough to leave me alone with my uncle  this afternoon who he knew was resolved to chide me and accordingly he began to rail at the caprice the obstinacy and inconsistency of our sex in very severe terms I was determined not to make any particular application and listened to him very patiently which reduced him to the necessity of being more explicit  I HOPED you had been in a certain degree free from those faults Maria  said he  but you have convinced me by your behaviour to Mr Harley that you are a very woman and that to give steadiness to your inclinations it is necessary you should meet with opposition  'HERE now' pursued he without waiting for my answer and indeed I had none ready for him  when to my shame be it spoken I viewed young Harley in no other light than as the son of an ungrateful man who had deceived  and betrayed me you were very favourably disposed towards him and some very tender letters passed between you  'OH Sir' interrupted I with some emotion  is this a candid representation of my conduct You have copies of my letters to Mr Harley will they bear such a comment  'WELL well' resumed Sir John  letting the letters pass if Mr Harley was indifferent to you where was the merit of your rejecting him to comply with my unreasonable prejudices That sacrifice Maria for so I considered it redoubled my affection for you great as it was before it has been greater since but you have spoiled all by your unaccountable behaviour Is this young man less amiable in your eyes because mine are open to his virtues  HAS he not deserved you by his noble disinterestedness and can I do less for him who saved my life at a time when it stood between him and happiness than bestow on him a gift which he values I am sure more than my estate which must be his whether I will or not since I have no other heir  MY dear uncle spoke all this so affectionately that I was melted into tears He mistook the cause of my emotion and starting from his chair began to pace about the room in great agitation  I WAS confounded not being able to guess at the cause of this transport when suddenly coming up to me and seizing my hand he looked earnestly at me for a moment then exclaimed  IS it possible have you really any dislike to Mr Harley and must I be disappointed in the pleasing design I had  formed of making my preserver happy  'DISLIKE to Mr Harley Sir' replied I 'No on the contrary' I stopped for his eyes were fixed upon me  'GO on' said he  your contrary come    EVERY one must be a friend to Mr Harley who knows him  said I  NOW my dear Euphemia the discovery you think you have made coming into my head that moment I felt my face glow like fire  'Very well' said my uncle  that blush is honester than your words and we are friends again my Maria so I will answer for you since Mr Harley is your choice Sir he shall be mine have I hit your meaning  You may always depend upon my obedience Sir  replied I  for I am sure you will never command any thing that is not reasonable  'Mighty well mighty well' cried my uncle in a joyful accent  I am satisfied  Mr Greville coming in at that moment 'Greville' said Sir John  write to Harley instantly tell him I say he is a fool  I hastened out of the room not being willing to hear more though it must be acknowledged my uncle has not on this occasion been inattentive to the claims of female delicacy Here is a prodigious change in my affairs a happy one I know you will think it But alas that happiness comes clogged with the painful idea of our separation  LETTER XXXII MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  I DISPATCHED my last letter to the post without waiting till I could give you an account of my interview with Mr Harley which I expected would soon take place for a messenger was immediately dispatched to him with a letter from my uncle which it was probable would soon bring him to the Hall and indeed he came so early the next morning that Sir John was not risen  By his order however he was introduced into his bedchamber where they had a conference of more than an hour I had already finished my morning walk when they came together into the garden to meet me for you know I am an early riser  While they were yet at some distance I could perceive so much heartfelt satisfaction in my uncle's looks in Mr Harley's so much joy which yet seemed checked by a certain timidity that encreased as he approached me that it was easy to guess their conversation had been very interesting  I summoned up all my courage in order to conquer my confusion and prevent my acting a silly part in the trying scene that was preparing for me and accordingly I paid my compliments to my uncle with an air very unembarrassed  as I thought but when Icurtseyed to Mr Harley my halfraised eyes were encountered with so passionate a glance at the same time that he bowed to me with the most profound respect as quite disconcerted me and I felt that I blushed and blushed the more because I felt it  My uncle did not give me time to recover myself  'It is in vain to dissemble Maria' said he eagerly  I have betrayed your secret to my young friend here I have told him that you have been kind enough to put it in my power to reward his nobleness of mind and pay him back some part of the vast debt of gratitude I owe him by a gift which knewing your merit so well as I do I will call a precious one  'RECEIVE her hand from me Harley' proceeded he  I promise you it is not an unwilling oneIs it niece  'If it were Sir' said I  I am sure you would not give it nor would I  I could not bring out another word I was half dead with confusion  Mr Harley as if remembering my rebuke a day or two before and fearful of incurring the same censure received my hand half bending on one knee but kept it glewed to his lips with so passionate an action that my uncle willing as it should seem to relieve me called out laughing  What have you nothing to say to her  We receive the answers of oracles Sir  replied he rising in awful silence  true devotion is dumb and all words  pursued he taking  my uncle's hand which he kissed respectfully  would be too weak to paint the excess of my transport and acknowledgment  You have done pretty well now however  said my uncle still smiling and giving his hand a hearty shake 'and now we will go in to breakfast'  Just as we were preparing to enter the house we perceived Mr Greville coming to meet us he drew near laughing  'I have rare news for you Sir John' said he  who do you think is come to breakfast with you even the learned and scientific Lady Cornelia Classick with the Diana of our forests the fearless huntress Miss Sandford who at the age of fortyfive declares her fixed resolution never to marry though an Endymion were to court  her and boasts of her wonderful art in keeping the men at a distance  Alas to what am I condemned for two hours at least  said Sir John  'Aye' replied Mr Greville  you must resolve to be patient but as for you Miss Harley  pursued he  fall upon your knees and thank me for sparing you the mortification of sharing this tremendous visit for I have told her that you are confined to your chamber with a sore throat a disorder she is infinitely afraid of so you may breakfast quietly in your dressingroom either alone or with company  looking at Mr Harley who would not venture to understand this proposal otherwise than by a speaking look  I thanked Mr Greville very cordially for the good office he had done me at the expence of his veracity and without taking notice of his insinuation  with regard to my having company to breakfast with me I told him I would employ the happy exemption he had afforded me in writing to you  He charged me with a thousand thousand good wishes for you and we parted  Mr Harley notwithstanding a little cloud upon his brow contrived unseen to kiss my hand with a mighty passionate air and here have I been ever since in company with my dear Euphemia but I must quit you soon I suppose for my maid tells me the ladies are going I hear their carriage draw up to the gateI must have one look at them  There is my uncle leading Lady Cornelia with the most gallant air imaginable By the motion of her hand and head it would seem that she is discussing some deep question in politics  theology or the belles lettres and my uncle by his asenting nods is fully convinced I observe  But here comes the virgin huntress with Mr Greville on one side of her and Mr Harley on the other I protest she does not accompany Lady Cornelia in the carriage but mounts her steed with most masculine agility to escort her female friend Her military ridinghabit the fierce cock of her hat the intrepid air of her countenance make her have the appearance of a very respectable guard Ah what a pity she has petticoats My uncle looks up to me as he passes and beckons me I come my dear Siragain Pray do not be impatient Adieu then my dear Euphemia for a short time only for I shall dispatch this letter to the post today  I found the gentlemen entertaining themselves very freely with the singularities of their female visitants How absurd does it seem in our sex to step out of nature in order to be more agreeable And how mortified would these mistaken candidates for general admiration be if they could unseen hear the censures and ridicule that are cast on them instead of the praises they expect  My uncle congratulated me on having escaped this disagreeable visit however said he your part would only have been silence for wherever Lady Cornelia is no one talks but herself  'Lady Cornelia' said Mr Greville  does not mix in company to converse but to make orations She will stun her female visitants of sixteen with learned gibberish gives rules for epic and dramatic poetry and cannot endure  a comedy that is not within the law of fourandtwenty hours  'Ah if your charming friend' pursued Mr Greville looking at me Can you guess who he meant my dear  had been here what a contrast might we not have observed between true genius and an affectation of knowledge elegant language and pedantic stiffness just sentiment and unintelligible conceit when the other preached she would only speak and as some one justly observes by making plain and simple answers to her riddles and giving distinction to her confusion she would have done her at least the good office of expounding her to herself  A man makes a silly figure' said Mr Harley  in company with so learned a Lady and her Amazonian friend Talents so masculine and so ostentatiously displayed place them above  those attentions and assiduities to which the charming sex have so just a claim and which we delight to pay Women should always be women the virtues of our sex are not the virtues of theirs When Lady Cornelia declaims in Greek and Miss Sandford vaults into her saddle like another Hotspur I forget I am in company with women the dogmatic critic awes me into silence and the hardy rider makes my assistance unnecessary  'You do well' said Mr Greville laughing  to find an excuse for not flying to take up Miss Sandford's handkerchief when she dropped it nor attending to a question put to you in Latin by Lady Cornelia  'Oh as for that' replied Mr Harley  Lady Cornelia answered herself and Miss Sandford drew up her handkerchief with the end of her whip so dexterously that I had no opportunity of serving her  'I DO not think hunting' said my uncle  a proper sport for ladies it spoils their complexion gives them masculine manners and hardens their tempers A woman who like Miss Sandford leaps every fivebar gate is ready to join the huntsman's hollow and would grieve if she is not in at the death may make a jolly companion over a flask of wine but must not expect to inspire a delicate passion I would as soon marry the female pedant her friend as one of those Amazonian ladies  'Ah Sir' replied Mr Harley  if you have seen the young the noble the beautiful Louisa join the chace under the conduct of a fond father and affectionate brothers you would confess that female delicacy may be preserved even in that habit and that exercise by the elegance and propriety of her dress she loses none of the tender graces of her sex and years her charming face retains all its sweetness  her form all its delicacy and her mind all its native softnessThe happy innocent animal whom she pursues but to save as if conscious of her generous intention takes shelter at her feet and there is sure of protection  You have rescued one of our fair huntresses from Sir John's general censure  said Mr Greville  Do you think we could not find a lady eminently distinguished for her erudition who yet is free from pedantry and ostentation  You Sir know such a one I am sure  replied Mr Harley  The wise the pious the virtuous Eleonora superior to most of our sex in learning in gentleness equal to the most gentle of her own The poets describe Modesty as blushing at her own motion Eleonora engages in discourse with timidity and is surprised confused to find her superiority acknowleged by those whose higher attainments she considered with awe  THEN this lady does not stun one with her Latin and Greek like Lady Cornelia  said my uncle  'So far from it Sir' replied Mr Harley  that unless her extraordinary acquirements are called forth by some apt and unavoidable occasion one may converse with her for whole years as a sensible and amiable woman without discovering her to be a great genius  Mr Harley this moment tapped at my door and presented me a small box which contained your dear picture which he would suffer no one to bring up to me but himself I could not help thanking him very cordially for the satisfaction he shewed in doing me this kind office  After we had spent some time in admiring those features which so powerfully express the beauty of the soul that  animates them I ordered my woman to tie the ribbon to which I had fastened it round my neck this task also he would perform and did very dexterously And now I would have had him leave me that I might be at liberty to indulge alone the sad yet pleasing ideas with which this dear image filled my mind when with a look of sympathising tenderness and concern he drew from his pocket your letter  Oh my Euphemia my foreboding heart told me this would be the last I should receive from you in England With trembling haste I broke the sealYour first lines confirmed the melancholy truthI burst into tears and vainly repeated to Mr Harley my earnest desire to be left alone He threw himself at my feet and while he held one of my hands and prest it to his lips I felt it wet with a sympathising tear  'Yes' said I  you would love her as I do if you knew her and like me you would grieve at being separated from her for ever  He soothed my sorrows by a tender participation in them He comforted me with hope and when he found me a little composed he told me that if I had any letters ready the messenger who brought the picture would procure a safe and speedy conveyance for them his brother being to set out immediately for London but that I had not a moment to lose Alas I have a thousand thousand things to say to you and not a moment to say them Farewell then my Euphemia and to that Almighty Power to whom such piety and virtue must be dear I trust the preservation of my friend Farewell farewell  Maria Harley  LETTER XXXIII MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  THIS will be the last letter you will receive from me in England my dear Maria and could I not at the same time that I tell you this disagreeable news congratulate you on your approaching union with the virtuous youth who has so well deserved you my full heart would have found it very difficult to bid you farewell but I leave you happy happy as my fondest wishes for you could require And once more I earnestly intreat you not to repine that my lot has not been cast so favourably as yours  A well disposed mind will extract good out of evil for whatever happens  to us there is some virtue or other to be exercised either patience or gratitude moderation or humility charty or resignation and they are all equally productive of peace here and happiness hereafter  And do you count it a small matter that I enjoy such a friendship as yours I tell you my Maria with such a friendship I can despise ill fortune and it affords me comforts which high fortune seldom enjoys  My picture will accompany this letter the person who carries it will bring me back what letters you have ready I shall begin a kind of journal from the day I leave England and continue it as long as I am able to hold a pen and thus I shall have the pleasure of conversing with you every day  The more splendid and active scenes of  your  life will hardly afford you equal  leisure to gratify me with packets as large as those I shall send you but I am persuaded you will neglect no opportunity of making me happy by your letters Fanny writes to you by my messenger who is this moment ready to set out I must then my Maria I must bid you farewellMost loved most amiable of friends farewell farewell  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER XXXIV MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  Portsmouth  MY DEAR MARIA  It was a great comfort to me that I did not miss your last packet which was delivered to me a few hours before I set out from London It brings me a confirmation of your happiness and can I then loving you as I do be less than happy when you are supremely so Mrs Bellenden insisted upon my performing my journey to this place in her coach though I made a fifth in it but the three young ladies accommodated themselves very easily on the back seat  and I was obliged to sit next their mother whose polite attention to me I am afraid was not properly repaid by one whose thoughts were so much engrossed by the absent  THE Colonel and Mr Neville with the menservants rode on horseback the maids were disposed of in the stagecoach and my worthy Mrs Benson and Fanny were together in a postchaise We were hospitably entertained two nights at the house of a friend of the Colonel's and next morning Captain Wilmot sent the boat full manned to bring the Colonel and his train on board the ship  AFTER all the ceremonies of our reception were over we retired to our several little apartments The Colonel and his family are all lodged near each other very commodiously One of the lieutenants an old acquaintance of Mr  Neville's having very obligingly resigned his cabin to me during the voyage I found a small writing desk in it which I shall make good use of Mrs Benson and Fanny continue to be bedfellows and are to be very near me  CAPTAIN Wilmot gave us an elegant dinner and did the honours of his table very gracefully The beautiful Miss Bellenden drew his particular attention though her vivacity seemed a little clouded by her regret at leaving England or rather her beloved London alone the scene of all her triumphs  I HAPPENED to be seated at table near a lady who I found was a relation of the Captain's she had the air and manner of a woman of fashion but seemed sunk in so profound a melancholy that although she answered with great politeness to the usual civilities that pass between persons at the same table yet  she did not engage at all in the conversation but seemed wholly taken up with her own sad thoughts  I OBSERVED her eyes were continually turned upon a most beautiful and ele gant boy about twelve years of age who sat opposite to her and when she removed them it was always with a sigh that seemed to rend her heart  THE boy whenever he met her eager glance turned pale and red alternately while his sweet eyes seemed full of tears which he strove to hide by forcing a smile at an austere looking gentleman next him who watched his looks attentively and never failed to repel the rising softness by a dreadful frown  WHILE I was busied in observing their different emotions which greatly affected me the lady whose stifled grief had almost risen to a suffocation  asked me in a voice scarcely articulate for a smellingbottle I immediately produced one and proposed to her to leave the company for a few minutes and go into fresher air  SHE accepted my supporting arm the ladies were now all in motion to assist her as well as the gentlemen but she begged to be permitted to withdraw for a few minutes with me on whom she still leaned  'AYE aye' said the stern gentleman whom I found was her husband  take a little air my dear this will go off  And nodding significantly at Captain Wilmot  Women will be foolish  said he  there is no help for it  THE sweet boy rose up eagerly as if he would have gone with us but was withheld by the frowning sire he yielded submissively but his eyes followed  us to the door with such an expression of tender anxiety as moved me greatly  I LED the lady to my little apartment and seated her on the bed She burst into a violent passion of tears which seemed a little to relieve her labouring heart I endeavoured to sooth her and begged of her to tell me if I could in any way be useful to her  'AH Madam' said she  I ought to ask your pardon for being thus troublesome to you with my grief but when you are a mother you will be able to guess what my sufferings are this moment  I AM upon the point of being separated perhaps for ever from the darling of my soul That boy that lovely boy you saw at table he is my son he is my only child the most dutiful the most affectionate of children he will be torn from me this day  his father will have it so I cannot survive this partingI wish not to survive it  ANOTHER shower of tears now burst from her eyes somebody tapping gently at the door I opened it and Captain Wilmot appeared leading the boy who seeing the disorder his mother was in sprung into her arms and leaning his head over her shoulder while she pressed him to her sobbing bosom he wept in silence anxious as it should seem to hide his tears  'It is you cousin' said the lady casting an upbraiding glance at the captain  it is to you that I am indebted for this severe affliction Why would you encourage Mr Mansel in this odious design of sending our son to sea is he not born to an easy fortune was he not prosecuting his studies with the greatest application and success  'MY dear cousin' interrupted the captain  you accuse me unjustly I found Captain Mansel determined to bring up his son to the seaservice a service in which he himself has acquired reputation I neither encouraged nor dissuaded him from his resolution but desired to have him on board my own ship and will it not be a greater satisfaction to you that he should make his first voyage under my care and protection than with a stranger  The poor little boy now interposed and taking one of his mother's hands which he kissed tenderly several times said in a soothing voice  My dear mamma make yourself easy I shall be very happy under my cousin's protection he will bring me back safe to you and if upon this trial I should not like the sea or be found unfit for it my papa may be persuaded to alter his mind  THE weeping mother made no reply but strained him again in her arms as if determined never to let him go from thence The captain and I employed every argument we could think of to console and satisfy her mind without attending to what we said she exclaimed  AH my child this boisterous element may not agree with the delicacy of your constitution Who now will watch over your health Who will attend to your complaints  'I WILL Madam' cried I eagerly  I will supply your place during this voyage in my cares and assiduity Master Mansel shall find another parent  OH what comfort do you give me Madam  said Mrs Mansel  if any thing can support me under this afflicting separation it will be this kind  promise of yours Edmund  said she to her son  this sweet lady will be your mother now I need not bid you love and respect her for you have a grateful heart  The boy answered only by a most expressive look and a bow low as the ground  CAPTAIN Mansel now burst in upon us  What have you not done whimpering yet  said he to his lady  Come come every body has been enquiring for you  HE strutted before her and Captain Wilmot giving her his hand to lead her to the company I addressed some trifling conversation to Master Mansel in order to begin our acquaintance and lessen his reserve  WHILE Mrs Mansel was apologizing to the company for her absence I took  care to seat myself next to my young charge as I now considered him I talked to him familiarly and lessened his diffidence insensibly He served me with my tea and coffee with a grace and freedom and at the same time with an assiduity that shewed at once the elegance of his manners and the particular pleasure he took in attending me  MY heart glowed with transport when I observed that the mothér who watched our behaviour beheld the growing intimacy with a satisfaction which seemed to suspend her grief She took an opportunity to approach meand grasping my hand with an eager pressure  I SEE my son will be happy in your favours to him  said she  this goodness of your's has preserved me from despair You are all over angel  pursued she in a transported accent  you look and act like one and Heaven  surely sent you to my relief on this trying occasion  I STOPPED this rhapsody by calling her attention to the little schemes we had formed for our amusement during the voyage I promised to make him acquainted with the colonel's young daughters and assured her he would pass his time very agreeably in such society  The evening now approached I expected she would be soon summoned to depart I felt for her so sincerely that I dreaded the fatal moment and could not help trembling when I saw Captain Wilmot advancing towards us He seemed disconcerted and unwilling to tell her that she must take leave of her son but Captain Mansel spared him the disagreeable task  'The boat is ready my dear' said he with an unfeeling abruptness  Edmund  God bless you Come my dear give him a kiss we must be gone  A PALENESS like that of death overspread her countenance She stood motionless uttering not a word nor sheding a tear whilst the boy who on his knee had received his father's blessing now prostrated himself at her feet and struggling to suppress his sighs and tears while he held her hand which he eagerly kissed several times uttered in broken accents  WILL you not give me your blessing my dear mamma Pray look upon medo not grieve I shall soon return to youindeed I shall  MRS Mansel whom I had supported all this time after breathing a deep sigh turned her eyes upon her son who was still kneeling and spreading her arms he sprung into her embrace weting  her bosom with his tears which now flowed fast from her eyes also  THIS scene affected even the men who were present Mrs Bellenden was greatly moved and the young ladies were drowned in tears  CAPTAIN Mansel's sterness put an end to it He seized his wife's hand and told her in a voice not very tender that she was to blame to work upon the boy's passions by giving way to her extravagant grief'See how he blubbers' continued he  what a milksop you make of him Come I shall lose all patience if you go on thus  THE poor lady who evidently was in great awe of him suffered herself to be led upon the deck I followed her with Master Mansel giving her as we passed on the most tender assurances of my attention to him She seemed struggling to repress her anguish and assume some  degree of fortitude and being now ready to seat herself in the chair by which she was to be let down into the boat after saluting the ladies and the rest of the company she took a more cordial leave of me whispering  Remember what you have promised me  Then solding her son once more in her arms she breathed an ardent blessing on him and still preserved some composure till she was got into the boat I then saw her suddenly sink into her husband's arms apparently in a fainting fit  HER son who had kept his eyes fixed upon her cried out to me in a mournful voice 'Ah Madam my mother' and hiding his face to conceal his tears I endeavoured to comfort him but in vain till perceiving she was recovered I bid him look up and shewed him his tender mother now standing waving her handkerchief to himwhich he returned  with repeated bows till the boat was out of sight  WE are got under sail all the ladies except Mrs Bellenden and myself are seasick My dear Mrs Benson struggled with the same disorder for some hours in order to keep me company but she was at last forced to yield to it and she as well as Fanny is confined to her bed  I SAT upon the quarterdeck as it is called more than two hours this morning under an awning which Lieutenant Crawford my husband's friend caused to be set up for me with no other company than my young charge who never leaves me but when he retires to his studies under the direction of the captain as for Mr Neville he always finds most amusement where I am not My eyes follow the receding shores while I revolve a thousand tender melancholy ideas and many a heavy sigh I breathed  which was constantly echoed back by my little friend who observing me taken up with my own thoughts did not offer to interrupt them by any conversation At last I asked him  Why he sighed so often    Some of my sighs are for myself Madam  replied he  but the greater part are for you when I see you melancholy I think it is my mother that I see soand can I choose but sigh then  MR Neville that moment came to us  'SO so young gentleman' said he  what always with the ladies you will make a fine sailor at this rate come I heard the captain ask for youI will bring you to him  Master Mansel after making me a low bow followed him  WE have now lost sight of landall is sky and ocean tremendous prospect  My mind feels its awful influence my ideas are all solemn and sad I have recourse to my books to dissipate them for Mrs Benson continues still too much indisposed to relieve me by her agreeable conversation My sweet Edmund is sick likewise but Fanny is better and able now to assist me in my office of nurse to him and my friend  TODAY Mrs Bellenden and I accompanied by the colonel took an airing upon deck This lady has a charming flow of spirits and so much natural as well as acquired politeness that although her understanding is not one of the firstrate yet her company is sometimes very desirable When I left her to retire to my own apartment I was most agreeably surprised to find Mrs Benson there quite recovered her sickness having lef  her as suddenly as it had come on and she is as it is common it seems in these cases the better for having been ill I embraced and  congratulated both her and myself for this change but as the good things of this life are often mixed with the bad I found Master Mansel worse and even with some symptoms of a fever I staid with him great part of the day and in the afternoon Mrs Benson and I went to visit our sick friends Mrs Bellenden we found busy in nursing her daughters for all their female attendants were so sick that she could have but little assistance from them Miss Bellenden wrapped in a white satin negligee with a most becoming nightdress on her head lay reclined on some cushions moaning grievously Our young naval commander had I found been extremely assiduous about her never failing to enquire a dozen times in a day concerning her health and when his visits were permitted expressed great solicitude for her But this single adorer could not comfort her for the gay scenes she had abandoned and the general admiration she supposed she had  attracted when in the midst of them she suffered more from discontent than sicknessshe is sullen fretful and impatient  WHEN I came into their apartment I found her mother gently reproving her for her behaviour which she said greatly affected her father who is very fond of her  'HE thinks it strange my dear' said Mrs Bellenden  that you should shew so much reluctance to follow him to any place where his duty calls him this peevishness alters you so that one would hardly know you  'ALTERS me Madam' repeated Miss Bellenden roused to attention by these interesting words  'YES my dear' replied Mrs Bellenden  I appeal to Mrs Neville for the justness of my observation  PRAY be free my dear Mrs Neville  said Miss Bellenden eagerly  Tell me am I really altered  'MY dear Miss' said I  I am sorry to be obliged to tell you so disagreeable a truth but if you suffer this depression of spirits to gain upon you it may produce the jaundice a distemper which is often the effect of continued discontent  'OH Heavens' cried Miss Bellenden taking out her pocketglass and fixing her eyes upon it  how you terrify me  COLONEL Bellenden and Captain Wilmot that moment entered the latter observing the young lady so intently gazing upon her own image that she did not perceive him went close up to her and whispered her to beware of the fate of Narcissus  'HAD Narcissus the jaundice then' said she turning to him  'THE jaundice' repeated the captain surprised  'AYE' said Miss Bellenden  here is Mrs Neville and my mamma have been frightening me out of my wits they tell me I am grown quite shocking with this seasickness I shall hate the sea while I live I wish we could have gone to this NewYork by land  'I AM glad that was not possible' said Captain Wilmor half smiling  for then I should not have had the pleasure of conducting you  I HEARD no more of the sprightly dialogue that ensued being engaged in discourse with the colonel and his lady and in paying my compliments to the two youngest ladies who are as ill as  their sister but not quite so impatient Presently afterwards Mrs Benson and I took leave of them  WHEN she left me to retire for the night I had recourse to my pen It is a great comfort to me to be this way with you and that from time to time I can make you read that your image is the dear companion of all my solitary hours  WHEN I visited Master Mansel this morning I was greatly alarmed to find his fever very high Captain Wilmot ordered the surgeon to attend him immediately This gentleman who is a grave sensible man and as far as I can judge very skilful thinks his distemper will be the smallpox Mrs Mansel it seems never had courage enough to have him inoculated unhappy yet amiable weakness in a mind so full of maternal tenderness  I AM now fixed by his bedside I give him all his medicines he refuses nothing from my hand At times he is delirious and then he takes me for his mother Giving me that tender appellation which he accompanies with such affectionate expressions of duty and obedience as go to my heart My anxiety is inexpressible I fear for him I fear for his motherI fear for myself for I feel a mother's tenderness for him  THE surgeon tells me the symptoms are all favourable He approves my method of nursing him but I have some contests to sustain with Mr Neville who is prejudiced in favour of all the old methods he is indeed diseased with opinion and infected by custom He says I starve the youth and although the weather is very warm mutters sadly when I suffer the fresh air to enter the little cabin He asks me  How I will answer it to Mrs Mansel if I kill her son by my improper management  I generally get off by referring him to the surgeon whose directions I tell him I am resolved to follow He retires shrugging up his shoulders and I in this case persist in my own way  I HAVE passed some days under the most uneasy solicitude but now thank Heaven all goes well the eruption is so favourable that the surgeon assures me we have nothing to fear But the dear boy's sensibility is so great that he even oppresses me with the excess of his gratitude He employs the warmest acknowledgments the most endearing expressions to testify the sense he has of what he calls my kindness to him I am obliged to leave him sometimes for half an hour together to put a stop to these strong effusions of his grateful heart lest they should act too powerfully upon his spirits  I HAVE the pleasure to tell you my dear Maria that notwithstanding all Mr Neville's fatal prognostications at which I own I have been weak enough to be sometimes alarmed that my young friend is perfectly recovered and will lose nothing of his beauty The little redness that remains on his face will the surgeon assures me leave no marks The Bellenden family and Captain Wilmot in particular have congratulated me upon this event in the most obliging terms  Mr Neville however persists in arraigning my skill as a nurse calls Master Mansel's recovery a lucky hit in which the odds were ten to one against him and declares when he is so happy as to be a father he will treat this distemper when his child has it his own way  HEAVEN forbid you should have a daughter then  cried Miss Bellenden  sure you do not intend to spoil her face Why what a cruel man are you  'Your mamma was more cruel' said Captain Wilmot to her in a low voice for he always contrives to sit next her  when she prevented what you think such a misfortune she may be called the first cause of all the murders you have committed  MISS Bellenden smiled graciously at this gross flattery which encouraged the gallant captain to add  CONFESS now have you the least remorse at being able to kill your thousand in a day  CLARA the lively Clara that moment raising her eyes from a book which she had been reading and casting them archly on her sister repeated  What a whole day and kill but one poor thousand  The powerful expression of her look and voice charmed me and rivetted the captain's attention upon her for a minute which Miss Bellenden observing said peevishly  I SUPPOSE Miss you found that piece of wit in your book there  'INDEED I did' said Clara  here you may read it if you please  and offered her the book which Miss Bellenden rejecting with a contemptuous frown the sweet girl gave it to me 'See Mrs Neville' said she  how truly my sister has guessed and guesswork it must always be with my sister  whispered she to me  for she hates reading and always joins with my mamma when she chides me for being fond of it  CAPTAIN W  lmot now hastily stepped up to me and looking over my shoulder  as I held the book open in my hand  'AH' said he  it is Dryden's tragedy of the Duke of Guise and Marmontierthe charming Marmontier speaks that sprightly line  HE begged me to give him the book and resuming his seat near Miss Bellenden read out the scene which is full of extravagant passion all which he applied to the fair coquet with too little ceremony I thought but she seemed highly delighted though he read so ill that Clara could not hide her dissatisfaction but murmured softly  Poor Dryden you have got into bad hands I perceive  WHEN the Colonel joined us the conversation took another turn for captain Wilmot is extremely reserved in his address to Miss Bellenden before her worthy father however as this gentleman's  private fortune is very considerable his present station respectable and his interest great he certainly would be no bad match for the young lady but a coquet generally uses her advantages so ill that these sudden attachments seldom produce any serious consequences  THE winds seem to favour the passion of our gallant commander and in order to keep the charming object near him have lulled themselves into so perfect a calm that we make in the sailor's phrase very little way and our voyage is likely to last long however as our sick are now in a fair way of being well we pass our time very agreeably We have music often cards sometimes and feasting every day  COLONEL Bellenden and the captain keep splendid tables we have constant invitations to both but I am never happier than when I am permitted to pass a day in private with my own family in  the pleasing vicissitude of conversation reading work and writing to you  POOR Miss Bellenden is in a state of mortification at present Notwithstanding the gratification her vanity has met with in the sighs of the enamoured Captain Wilmot she has always pined in secret after the fuller triumphs she enjoyed in the gay metropolis where she was a general toast The uneasiness of her mind has brought on hysteric fits to which it seems she is subject  HITHER TO she has been a very charming invalid and both her languor and her deshabille have been alike becoming and being well aware of this circumstance her adorer has not been kept at a distance on account of her indisposition which only rendered her charms more interesting but it is quite another thing with an hysteric fit  CAPTAIN Wilmot happened to be present yesterday when she was suddenly seized with one which proved to be very violent her frantic screams the distortions of her countenance her struggles in which she exerted such strength that it was with difficulty her mother assisted by two maids and myself could hold her Her lover stood motionless for some minutes with amazement and strong marks of disgust mixed with some transient gleams of pity appeared in his countenance He hastened to send the surgeon and in the mean time the young lady recovered her senses I left her after she had taken some drops and meeting Captain Wilmot as I was returning to my own apartment he led me to the door of it enquiring with more curiosity as I thought than concern after the sick lady I told him she was in no danger he smiled but in a grave accent said it was a terrible malady he had never seen any thing like it  WE have for this week past had what the sailors call a brisk wind and that so favourable that the Captain tells us we may soon expect to reach our desired port The weather is now very warm and a few days ago it was so intensely cold that we were scarce able to endure its rigour this effect was produced it seems by our passing near an island of ice which rose up in the midst of the ocean to a surprising height exactly in the form of a sugarloaf which it resembled in colour as well as shape  I WENT upon deck with the rest of the ladies to take a view of it but was not able to stay more than a few moments my limbs seemed all benumbed with cold and my teeth as the phrase is chattered in my head Happily this inconvenience did not last long we soon lost sight of this beautiful but uncomfortable object and its freezing influence was no longer felt  PROVIDENCE has been pleased to grant us hitherto so favourable a navigation that nothing has happened to act even upon the fears of ignorance and inexperience like mine except a a few squalls as the sailors call a sudden gust of wind The hurry and bustle these would occasion among the mariners seemed to me a certain indication that we were going to the bottom but the danger as well as the apprehension was soon over  THE sailors are now emulously climbing up to the topmast head as they call it looking out for land from this fearful height they seem no bigger than crows Happy will the man be who first discovers it he will be presented with a handsome purse the joint offering of all the passengers We are all full of pleasing anxious expectation  IN this interval of hope and suspence I often amuse myself with observing  what passes between the Captain and Miss Bellenden the loverlover now no more since the adventure of the hysteric fit is become a much more agreeable companion now that his attention is not wholly engaged by one object the lady's malady has restored him to health he converses freely and in general his eyes are no longer rivetted upon one face he is at leisure to attend to all the little complaisances and assiduities which a polite man pays to every female in company but which a lover confines to one  HE disguises his indifference however under a most profound respect Miss Bellenden seems amazed confounded she calls forth all her attractions she varies her posture twenty times in a minute in vain his attention is wholly disengaged she grows peevish complains of the length of the voyage enquires impatiently when it will be at an end The Captain tells her he  hopes soon to have the pleasure of congratulating her upon the fight of land She staresHe enters into some indifferent discourse with Mrs Bellenden or myself She is now downright angry and frowns he does not perceive it but in the course of the conversation addresses her with the same free unembarrassed air as any other person in the company and when she sullenly neglects to answer any question he happens to ask her he shews not the least surprise but repeats it with all the apparent simplicity imaginable till she thinks fit to answer him  HER coquetry is now at a stand smiles and frowns peevishness and good humour produce no alteration in his countenance and behaviour he is always polite always respectful and always indifferent  IT is common with persons of deeper thinking than Miss Bellenden to change  their opinions of others by their kindness or unkindness to them This young lady has now found out that Captain Wilmot is a very silly fellow rude unpolished in a word a mere sailor and is much mortified to find none of us can be persuaded to think as she does However she condescended yesterday to throw out what she thought a lure for him which produced an effect quite contrary from what she expected and which to some of us who knew the secret was a very diverting one  THE young ladies and myself were together in the gallery admiring the most beautiful landscape imaginable formed by the setting sun when Captain Wilmot joined us He had scarce paid his compliments when we were alarmed with a cry that one of the sailors had fallen over board though this bad news was immediately contradicted yet it had such an effect upon the tender nerves of Miss Bellenden that she sighed out  'OH I shall faint' and would actually have fallen if I had not supported her for the Captain who was still nearer her being apprehensive that she was going to have another hysteric fit instead of receiving her in his arms ran away as fast as he could to send the Doctor and we could hear him calling aloud for him long after the lady was recovered Miss Bellenden looked mortified to the last degree and retired led by her two sisters  I MET the Captain some time afterwards and rallied him a little upon his want of gallantry He assured me he had not fortitude enough to bear the sight of a lady in an hysteric fit and he thought the best thing he could do was to send the Doctor to her assistance  IF this young lady could be convinced that these fits to which she is so subject prove a powerful antidote  against the effects of her charms she might possibly endeavour to restrain the violence of her temper for it is to that and not to the weakness of her constitution that she owes this disgusting malady  I WAS just risen this morning when the sound of  land land  reached my ears and which was soon afterwards repeated by a hundred voices at once A good we ardently wish for always appears uncertain till we are in possession of it This may be an illusion thought I a mistake arising from too great eagerness for the promised reward but I was scarce dressed when the good news was confirmed to me by Master Mansel who with a countenance like an April day half smiles half tears came to wish me joy that our voyage would soon be happily concluded  'METHINKS my dear little friend' said I  your satisfaction on this occasion  is not altogether unmixed with some chagrin what is the reason  'BECAUSE Madam' replied he  I shall soon lose you you will forget me I fear and this parting will be almost as terrible to me as the separation from my mother for have you not been a mother to me pursued he respectfully kissing my hand which I felt wet with his tears 'and can I help loving you like a son  I COMFORTED him with assurances that I would always love him tenderly and that while Captain Wilmot remained on the coast I would make frequent opportunities of seeing him  I NOW went to pay my compliments to the Colonel and his family Mr Neville who it must be acknowledged is very exact in his observance of all due respect to his commander was already in his apartment which was soon filled  with several of the naval officers When Captain Wilmot joined the company Miss Bellenden affected the most extravagant joy at the prospect of being soon delivered from her consinement on board an  odious  ship The Captain without taking notice of an expression that insinuated so great a dislike to her present situation appeared to enjoy the universal satisfaction He gave us an elegant entertainment at which the mortified fair sat sullen and silent He assures us we shall make the harbour in two days  THE wished for port is now in sight we are all busy in making preparations for our landing Miss Bellenden and her maid have been in close consult for many hours The article of dress on this occasion is an arduous affair with this young lady  WE are entering fast the harbourI have now a sight of this new world my heart throbs with sensations unfelt  beforeI dread I hope I wish I know not whatmy thoughts are all confused I know not whether to rejoice or weep but I feel a disposition to do both  I AM roused from this revery by the noise of the cannon from the fort The city of NewYork seems to rise from the waves and viewed from the sea makes a fine appearance The noise of the salutes given and received from all the ships in the harbour as well as the citadel stuns me We have now cast anchor I must lay down my pen Mr Neville tells me the ladies expect meThe barge is ordered My next letter will be dated from the city now in my view  NewYork  TILL this moment my dear Maria I have not had leasure to resume my little  narrative though I have been already two days upon this island  WHEN I waited upon Mrs Bellenden in the great cabin I found the ladies all ready to embark in the ship's barge which was full manned the streamers flying and every decoration both for state and convenience ordered by the Captain to accommodate Colonel Bellenden and his family  WHEN Miss Bellenden came upon deck in the full blaze of dress and beauty I observed Captain Wilmot look at her attentively not without some emotions of surprise and pleasure as I thought but they were soon checked by the silly consciousness she betrayed of her own charms and the scornful yet exulting glances she cast upon him And he now having taken a polite leave of Mrs Bellenden addressed her with the most perfect indifference associating myself and the young  ladies her sisters in his parting compliments  WHEN we were all seated in the barge with Mrs Bellenden at our head I observed to her smiling that she had a numerous suite and indeed her charming daughters Mrs Benson myself Fanny with the female servants who were all well drest formed a respectable train  THE Governor's coaches waited our landing the Colonel put me into the first coach with his lady and daughters Mrs Bellenden would have it so he went in the next himself with Mrs Benson Mr Neville and Fanny who modestly declined the honour but the Colonel insisted upon taking her  WE were carried to a very large house the principal tavern in the place where a magnificent dinner was provided Here we found a gentleman  waiting our arrival who complimented the Colonel from the Governor and introduced some ladies wives to some of the principal merchants one of whom did the honours of the table very politely  THE Governor had caused Colonel Bellenden to be informed that he would wait upon him in the evening but the Colonel ever strictly attentive to all the duties of his station with great politeness prevented this visit which was intended as a mark of high respect and paid a visit himself to the Governor after dinner taking Mr Neville along with him In the evening we went to the several lodgings provided for us in the town and had reason to be satisfied with their neatness and convenience  THIS city is situated upon an island about fourteen miles long but not more than two broad This island is just in the mouth of the river Hudson  one of the noblest rivers in America and is navigable for more than two hundred miles Albany the next principal city of the province is situated on the same river at about a hundred and fifty miles distant from NewYork There Colonel Bellenden being second in military command to the Governor will generally reside half of the troops being constantly quartered there and there also we must settle my husband being one of the Colonel's lieutenants  MRS Bellenden received a visit today from the Governor's lady she brought with her three of her daughters all handsome their manners easy and engagingso easy that after the first ceremonies were over they entered into the most familiar conversation with the Colonel's daughters and before they parted made them a thousand professions of friendship with surprising cordiality which ceased to be surprising when I found these suddenly formed attachments  is the custom of the place When Mrs Bellenden presented me to the Governor's lady she in a very graceful manner just mentioned my family in order to procure me a more distinguished notice and it must be acknowledged that Mrs Montague answered her intention perfectly well by the reception she gave me  YESTERDAY we dined at the Governor's and were most splendidly entertained He resides in a very spacious house within the fort where a lieutenant's guard mounts every day It being Sunday we heard divine service in the Governor's chapel It is small but elegant the Governor and his family sit in a little covered gallery decorated with velvet hangings and cushions they enter it by a door from one of their own apartments The principal officers and their wives who are considered as the nobility of the place the Secretary of the Province and some other persons  in civil employments have pews in this chapel and are always invited to the Governor's table who is very hospitable very polite and without descending from his dignity extremely affable He has the reputation of being a man of distinguished understanding  A SUCCESSION of visits balls and entertainments for these ten days past have fatigued me greatly which together with the heat of the climate at this season of the year brought on a little fever for which Mrs Montague prescribes change of air and insists upon my passing a week at a little cottage of her's as she calls it about two miles from the city where she promises to join me in a day or two I shall set out accompanied only by Mrs Benson and Fanny  MR Neville is perpetually engaged and pleads in excuse for his not attending me in this little excursion the importunities  of the numerous friends he has made since his arrival here who will not suffer him to have an hour at his own disposal  MRS Benson tells him that it is a great misfortune to be so much beloved for that one of whom so many others have need can be of little use to himself 'For my own part' added she  I think it better to be less agreeable and as somebody says never to sacrifice to the graces at all than to become the victim of the sacrifice  MR Neville looked a little grave at first not knowing whether to take what she said as a compliment or banter but selflove explained it to his own advantage and the cloud that was gathering on his brow soon dispersed  A RIDE of about half an hour brought me to Mrs Montague's little villa a cottage for its simplicity but it is a  palace for elegance and convenienceThe scene is sweetly romantic I seem already to inhale health and spirits from the balmy breeze impregnated with a thousand sweets from the flowers which in vast profusion bloom around me How sweet is solitude to a mind capable of relishing its calm and rational pleasures Yet it is true that your absence is a perpetual drawback upon every thing that gives me joy and possessing you but in idea it requires a very strong imagination to make me desire nothing more  MR Neville favoured me with a visit this morning to tell me that a ship will sail tomorrow for England and that I must make up my packet which he will take care to put into proper hands that it may be safely delivered I have been so short a time here that I can say but little of the place and its inhabitants The city of NewYork as I observed  before makes a good appearance viewed from the sea but its streets are irregularThe houses are of brick and some of them built in the Dutch taste who were the first settlers and many of their descendants remain here The town has a flourishing trade which produces great profits The merchants are wealthy and the people in general comfortably provided for and that with very moderate labour There seems to be great freedom of society among the better sort who are rich and hospitable The officers live in a stile suitable to the distinguished rank they hold hereAnd the Governor though easy of access and very affable in his manners keeps up a proper state and dignity  THE soil of this country I am told is extremely fruitful abounding not only in its native grain Indian corn but in all such as have been naturalized here from Europe Here is wheat they  say in such abundance and so excellent that few parts of the world for the part that is cultivated exceed it in either of these qualities nor in barley oats rye and every sort of grain which you have They have here a great number of horned cattle Horses sheep hogsall the European poultry abound here Game of all kinds is extremely plentyWild turkies of a vast size and equal goodness and a beautiful species of pheasants only found they say in this country Every species of herbs or roots which you force in your gardens grows here with great case as well as every kind of fruit but some such as peaches and melons in far greater perfection than you have them  FROM the account I have given you my dear Maria of the productions of this clime you will readily agree that an epicure may find sufficient gratifications  here for his predominant passion  MR Neville bids me haste and conclude He is going back to town immediately and only waits for my packet I inclose a few lines for my Lord L which I intrust to your care he is the only person among my relations who I believe is anxious to hear from me  THIS letter will perhaps reach your hands in three weeks if the wind is favourable and the ship not becalmed as ours was and perhaps one from you is upon its road to meOh that thought how I enjoy it I am charged with a thousand compliments to you from Mrs Benson and Mr Neville Your Fanny is well and happy and tells you so herself in a letter which I inclose Say every thing that is respectful  and kind in my name to Sir John and Mr Harley And from your own heart my dearest friend judge of the unalterable affection of your  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
