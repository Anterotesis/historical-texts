 THE NEWRIVER HEAD A TALE Attempted in the Manner of Mr CDENIS And Inscribed to JOHN WILKES Esq  BY ROBERT LLOYD  Labitur labetur in omne volubilis aevum  HOR  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY opposite St Martin's Church LudgateStreet and W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Gate Holborn MDCCLXIII  THE NEWRIVER HEAD A TALE  DEAR WILKES whose lively social Wit  Disdains the prudish Affectation  Of gloomy Folks who love to sit  As Doctors  should  at Consultation  Permit me in familiar Strain  To steal you from the idle hour  Of combating the NORTHERN THANE  And all his puppet tools of Power  Shame to the Wretch if sense of shame  Can ever touch the miscreant's breast  Who dead to virtue as to fame  A Monster whom the Gods detest  Turns traitor to himself to court  Or Minister or Monarch's smile  And dares in insolence of sport  Invade the CHARTER of our Isle  But why should I who only strive  By telling of an easy tale  To keep attention half alive  'Gainst BOLGOLAM and FLIMNAP rail  For whether ENGLAND be the name  Name which we're taught no more to prize  Or BRITAIN it is all the same  The Lilliputian Statesmen rise  To malice of gigantic size  Let them enjoy their warmth a while  Truth shall regard them with a smile  While you like GULLIVER in sport  Piss out the fire and save the Court  But to returnThe tale is old  Indecent truly none of mine  What BEROALDUS gravely told  I read it in that sound divine  And for indecency you know  She had her fashionable turn  As prim observers clearly shew  In t'other Parson Doctor STERNE  Yet POPE denies it all defence  And calls it bless us Want of sense  But e'en the  decent  POPE can write  Rape of the Lock  Of bottles corks and maiden sighs  Of charming beauties less in sight  Of the more secret precious hair  Pope's Letters  "And something else of little Size  You know where"  If such Authorities prevail  To varnish o'er this petty sin  I plead a pardon for my tale  And having hemm'd and cough'dbegin  A Genius one of those I mean  We read of in th' Arabian Nights  Not such as every day are seen  At Bob's or Arthur's whilom White's  For howsoe'er you change the name  The Clubs and Meetings are the same  Nor those prodigious learned folks  Your Haberdashers of stale Jokes  Who dress them up so neat and clean  For Newspaper or Magazine  But one that could play wond'rous tricks  Changing the very course of Nature  Not ASMODEUS on two sticks  Or sage URGANDA could do greater  Once on a time incog came down  From his equivocal dominions  And travell'd o'er a country town  To try folks tempers and opinions  When to accomplish his intent  For had the cobler known the king  Lord it would quite have spoil'd the thing  In strange disguise he slily went  And stump'd along the highway track  With greasy knapsack at his back  And now the night was pitchy dark  Without one star's indulgent spark  Whether he wanted sleep or not  Is of no consequence to tell  A bed and lodging must be got  For geniuses live always well  At the best house in all the town  It was th' attorney's you may swear  He knock'd as he'd have beat it down  Knock as you would no entrance there  But from the window cried the dame  Go sirrah go from whence you came  Here Nell John Thomas see who knocks  Fellow I'll put you in the stocks  Be gentle ma'm the Genius cried  Have mercy on the wand'ring poor  Who knows not where his head to hide  And asks a pittance at your door  A mug of beer a crust of bread  Have pity on the houseless head  Your husband keeps a lordly table  I ask but for the offal crumbs  And for a lodgingbarn or stable  Will shroud me till the morning comes  'Twas all in vain she rang the bell  The servants trembl'd at the knell  Down flew the maids to tell the men  To drive the vagrant back agen  He trudg'd away in angry mind  And thought but cheaply of mankind  Till thro' a casement's dingy pane  A rushlight's melancholy ray  Bad him e'en try his luck again  Perhaps beneath a house of clay  A wand'ring passenger might find  A better friend to human kind  And far more hospitable fare  Tho' not so costly nice or rare  As smokes upon the silver plate  Of the luxurious pamper'd great  So to this cot of homely thatch  In the same plight the genius came  Down comes the dame lifts up the latch  What want ye sir  God save you dame  And so he told the piteous tale  Which you have heard him tell before  Your patience and my own would fail  Were I to tell it o'er and o'er  Suffice it that my goody's care  Brought forth her best tho' simple fare  And from the cornercupboard's hoard  Her stranger guest the more to please  Bespread her hospitable board  With what she had'twas bread and cheese  'Tis honest tho' but homely cheer  Much good may't do ye eat your fill  Would I cou'd treat you with strong beer  But for the action take the will  You see my cot is clean tho' small  Pray heav'n encrease my slender stock  You're welcome friend you see my all  And for your bed sirthere's a flock  No matter what was after said  He eat and drank and went to bed  And now the cock his mattins sung  Howe'er such singing's light esteem'd  'Tis precious in the Muses' tongue  When sung rimes better than he scream'd  The dame and pedlar both arose  At early dawn of rising day  She for her work of folding cloaths  And He to travel on his way  But much he thought himself to blame  If as in duty surely bound  He did not thank the careful dame  For the reception he had found  Hostess quoth He before I go  I thank you for your hearty Fare  Would it were in my pow'r to pay  My gratitude a better way  But money now runs very low  And I have not a doit to spare  But if you'll take this piece of Stuff  No quoth the dame I'm poor as you  Your kindest wishes are enough  You're welcome friend farewellAdieu  But first reply'd the wand'ring guest  For bed and board and homely dish  May all things turn out for the best  So take my blessing and my wish  May what you first begin to do  Create such profit and delight  That you may do it all day through  Nor finish till the depth of night  Thank you she said and shut the door  Turn'd to her work and thought no more  And now the napkin which was spread  To treat her guest with good brown bread  She folded up with nicest care  When lo another napkin there  And every folding did beget  Another and another yet  She folds a shiftby strange encrease  The remnant swells into a piece  Her Caps her Laces all the same  Till such a quantity of Linen  From such a very small beginning  Flow'd in at once upon the Dame  Who wonder'd how the duce it came  That with the drap'ry she had got  Within her little shabby cot  She might for all the town provide  And break both Yorkstreet and Cheapside  It happen'd that th' attorney's wife  Who to be sure took much upon her  As being one in higher Life  Who did the Parish mighty honour  Sent for the Dame who poor and willing  Would take a job of charing work  And sweat and toil like any Turk  To earn a sixpence or a shilling  She could not come not she indeed  She thank'd her much but had no need  Good news will fly as well as bad  So out this wond'rous story came  About the Pedlar and the Dame  Which made th' Attorney's wife so mad  That she resolv'd at any rate  Spite of her pride and Lady airs  To get the Pedlar téte a téte  And make up all the past affairs  And tho' she wish'd him at the devil  When he came there the night before  Determin'd to be monstrous civil  And drop her curtsie at the door  Now all was racket noise and pother  Nell running one way John another  And Tom was on the coachhorse sent  To learn which way the Pedlar went  Thomas return'dthe Pedlar brought  What could my dainty Madam say  For not behaving as she ought  And driving honest folks away  Upon my word it shocks me much  But there's such thieving here of late  Not that I dream'd that you were such  When you came knocking at my gate  I must confess myself to blame  And I'm afraid you lately met  Sad treatment with that homely dame  Who lives on what her hands can get  Walk in with me at least tonight  And let us set all matters right  I know my duty and indeed  Would help a friend in time of need  Take such refreshment as you find  I'm sure I mean it for the best  And give it with a willing mind  To such a grave and sober guest  So in they came and for his picking  Behold the table covers spread  Instead of Goody's cheese and bread  With tarts and fish and flesh and chicken  And to appear in greater state  The knives and forks with silver handles  The candlesticks of bright French plate  To hold her best mould tallow candles  Were all brought forth to be display'd  In female housewifry parade  And more the Pedlar to regale  And make the wond'rous man her friend  Decanters foam'd of mantling ale  And port and claret without end  They hobb'd and nobb'd and smil'd and laugh'd  Touch'd glasses nam'd their toasts and quaff'd  Talk'd over every friend and foe  Till eating drinking talking past  The kind houseclock struck twelve at last  When wishing Madam  bon repos  The Pedlar pleaded weary head  Made his low bow and went to bed  Wishing him then at perfect ease  A good soft bed a good sound sleep  Now gentle reader if you please  We'll at the Lady take a peep  She could not rest but turn'd and toss'd  While Fancy whisper'd in her brain  That what her indiscretion lost  Her art and cunning might regain  Such Linnen to so poor a dame  For such coarse fare perplex'd her head  Why might not she expect the same  So courteous civil and wellbred  And now she reckon'd up her store  Of Cambricks Hollands Muslins Lawns  Free gifts and Purchases and Pawns  Resolv'd to multiply them more  Till she had got a Stock of Linnen  Fit for a Dowager to sin in  The morning came when up she got  Most ceremoniously inclin'd  To wind up her sagacious plot  With all that civil stuff we find  'Mongst those who talk a wond'rous deal  Of what they neither mean nor feel  How shall I Ma'm reply'd the Guest  Make you a suitable return  For your attention and concern  And such civilities exprest  To one who must be still in debt  For all the kindness he has met  For this your entertainment's sake  If ought of good my wish can do  May what you first shall undertake  Last without ceasing all day through  Madam who kindly understood  His wish effectually good  Strait dropp'd a curtsie wond'rous low  For much she wanted him to go  That she might look up all her store  And turn it into thousands more  Now all the maids were sent to look  In every cranny hole and nook  For every rag which they could find  Of any size or any kind  Draw'rs Boxes Closets Chests and Cases  Were all unlock'd at once to get  Her Point her Gawz her Prussianet  With fifty names of fifty kinds  Which suit variety of minds  How shall I now my tale persue  So passing strange so passing true  When every bit from every hoard  Was brought and laid upon the board  Left some more urgent obligation  Might interrupt her pleasing toil  And marring half her application  The promis'd hopes of profit spoil  Before she folds a single rag  Or takes a cap from board or bag  That nothing might her work prevent  For she was now resolv'd to labour  With earnest hope and full intent  To get the better of her neighbour  Into the garden she would go  To do that necessary thing  Which must by all be done you know  By rich and poor and high and low  By Male and Female Queen and King  She little dream'd a common action  Practis'd as duly as her pray'rs  Sould prove so tedious a transaction  Or cost her such a sea of cares  In short the streams so plenteous flow'd  That in the dry and dusty weather  She might have water'd all the road  For ten or twenty miles together  What could she do as it began  Th' involuntary torrent ran  Instead of folding Cap or Mob  So dreadful was this distillation  That from a simple watering job  She fear'd a general Inundation  While for her Indiscretion's crime  And coveting too great a store  She made a river at a time  Which sure was never done before  FINIS
