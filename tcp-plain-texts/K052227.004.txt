The fourth Battel continued in which  Neptune  assists the  Greeks  The Acts of  Idomeneus  NEptune  concern'd for the Loss of the  Grecians  upon seeing the Fortification forc'd by  Hector  who had enter'd the Gate near the Station of the  Ajaxes  assumes the Shape of  Calchas  and inspires those Heroes to oppose him Then in the Form of one of the Generals encourages the other  Greeks  who had retir'd to their Vessels The  Ajaxes  form their Troops in a close Phalanx and put a stop to  Hector  and the  Trojans  Several Deeds of Valour are perform'd  Meriones  losing his Spear in the Encounter repairs to seek another at the Tent of  Idomeneus  This occasions a Conversation between those two Warriors who return together to the Battel  Idomeneus  signalizes his Courage above the

but goes first to rally the  Trojans  upbraids  Paris  rejoins  Polydamas  meets  Ajax  again and renews the Attack  The eight and twentieth Day still continues The Scene is etween the  Grecian  Wall and the Seashore  THE THIRTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  WHEN now the Thund'rer on the Seabeat Coast  Had fix'd great  Hector  and his conqu'ring Host  He left them to the Fates in bloody Fray  To toil and struggle thro' the wellfought Day  Then turn'd to  Thracia  from the Field of Fight  Those Eyes that shed insufferable Light  To where the  Mysians  prove their martial Force  And hardy  Thracians  tame the savage Horse  And where the farfam'd  Hippemolgian  strays  Renown'd for Justice and for length of Days  Thrice happy Race that innocent of Blood  From Milk innoxious seek their simple Food  Jove  sees delighted and avoids the Scene  Of guilty  Troy  of Arms and dying Men  No Aid he deems to either Host is giv'n  While his high Law suspends the Pow'rs of Heav'n  Meantime the  Neptune  Monarch of the watry Main  Observ'd the Thund'rer nor observ'd in vain  In  Samothracia  on a Mountain's Brow  Whose waving Woods o'erhung the Deeps below  He sate and round him cast his azure Eyes  Where  Ida  's misty Tops confus'dly rise  Below fair  Ilion  's glitt'ring Spires were seen  The crowded Ships and sable Seas between  There from the crystal Chambers of the Main  Emerg'd he sate and mourn'd his  Argives  slain  At  Jove  incens'd with Grief and Fury stung  Prone down the rocky Steep he rush'd along  Fierce as he past the lofty Mountains nod  The Forests shake Earth trembled as he trod  And felt the Footsteps of th' immortal God  From Realm to Realm three ample Strides he took  And at the fourth the distant  Aegae  shook  Far in the Bay his shining Palace stands  Eternal Frame not rais'd by mortal Hands  This having reach'd his brasshoof'd Steeds he reins  Fleet as the Winds and deck'd with golden Manes  Refulgent Arms his mighty Limbs infold  Immortal Arms of Adamant and Gold  He mounts the Car the golden Scourge applies  He sits superior and the Chariot flies  His whirling Wheels the glassy Surface sweep  Th' enormous Monsters rolling o'er the Deep  Gambol around him on the watry way  And heavy Whales in aukward Measures play  The Sea subsiding spreads a level Plain  Exults and owns the Monarch of the Main  The parting Waves before his Coursers fly  The wond'ring Waters leave his Axle dry  Deep in the liquid Regions lies a Cave  Between where  Tenedos  the Surges lave  And rocky  Imbrus  breaks the rolling Wave  There the great Ruler of the azure Round  Stop'd his swift Chariot and his Steeds unbound  Fed with ambrosial Herbage from his Hand  And link'd their Fetlocks with a golden Band  Infrangible immortal There they stay  The Father of the Floods pursues his way  Where like a Tempest dark'ning Heav'n around  Or fiery Deluge that devours the Ground  Th' impatient  Trojans  in a gloomy Throng  Embattel'd roll'd as  Hector  rush'd along  To the loud Tumult and the barb'rous Cry  The Heav'ns reecho and the Shores reply  They vow Destruction to the  Grecian  Name  And in their Hopes the Fleets already flame  But  Neptune  rising from the Seas profound  The God whose Earthquakes rock the solid Ground  Now wears a mortal Form like  Calchas  seen  Such his loud Voice and such his manly Mien  His Shouts incessant ev'ry  Greek  inspire  But most th'  Ajaces  adding Fire to Fire  'Tis yours O Warriors all our Hopes to raise  Oh recollect your ancient Worth and Praise  'Tis yours to save us if you cease to fear  Flight more than shameful is destructive here  On other Works tho'  Troy  with Fury fall  And pour her Armies o'er our batter'd Wall  There  Greece  has strength but this this Part o'erthrown  Her Strength were vain I dread for you alone  Here  Hector  rages like the Force of Fire  Vaunts of his Gods and calls high  Jove  his Sire  If yet some heav'nly Pow'r your Breast excite  Breathe in your Hearts and string your Arms to Fight  Greece  yet may live her threatned Fleet maintain  And  Hector  's Force and  Jove  's own Aid be vain  Then with his Sceptre that the Deep controuls  He touch'd the Chiefs and steel'd their manly Souls  Strength not their own the Touch divine imparts  Prompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts  Then as a Falcon from the rocky Height  Her Quarry seen impetuous at the Sight  Forthspringing instant darts her self from high  Shoots on the Wing and skims along the Sky  Such and so swift the Pow'r of Ocean flew  The wide Horizon shut him from their View  Th' inspiring God  Oileus'  active Son  Perceiv'd the first and thus to  Telamon  Some God my Friend some God in human form  Fav'ring descends and wills to stand the Storm  Not  Calchas  this the venerable Seer  Short as he turn'd I saw the Pow'r appear  I mark'd his parting and the Steps he trod  His own bright evidence reveals a God  Ev'n now some Energy divine I share  And seem to walk on Wings and tread in Air  With equal Ardour  Telamon  returns  My Soul is kindled and my Bosom burns  New rising Spirits all the Man alarm  Lift each impatient Limb and brace my Arm  This ready Arm unthinking shakes the Dart  The Blood pours back and fortifies my Heart  Singly methinks yon' tow'ring Chief I meet  And stretch the dreadful  Hector  at my Feet  Full of the God that urg'd their burning Breast  The Heroes thus their mutual Warmth express'd  Neptune  meanwhile the routed  Greeks  inspir'd  Who breathless pale with length of Labours tir'd  Pant in the Ships while  Troy  to Conquest calls  And swarms victorious o'er their yielding Walls  Trembling before th' impending Storm they lie  While Tears of Rage stand burning in their Eye  Greece  sunk they thought and this their fatal Hour  But breathe new Courage as they feel the Pow'r  Teucer  and  Leitus  first his Words excite  Then stern  Peneleus  rises to the Fight  Thoas Deipyrus  in Arms renown'd  And  Merion  next th' impulsive Fury found  Last  Nestor  's Son the same bold Ardour takes  While thus the God the martial Fire awakes  Oh lasting Infamy oh dire Disgrace  To Chiefs of vig'rous Youth and manly Race  I trusted in the Gods and you to see  Brave  Greece  victorious and her Navy free  Ah nothe glorious Combate you disclaim  And one black Day clouds all her former Fame  Heav'ns what a prodigy these Eyes survey  Unseen unthought till this amazing Day  Fly we at length from  Troy  's oftconquer'd Bands  And falls our Fleet by such inglorious Hands  A Rout undisciplin'd a straggling Train  Not born to Glories of the dusty Plain  Like frighted Fawns from Hill to Hill pursu'd  A Prey to every Savage of the Wood  Shall these so late who trembled at your Name  Invade your Camps involve your Ships in Flame  A Change so shameful say what Cause has wrought  The Soldiers Baseness or the Gen'ral's Fault  Fools will ye perish for your Leader's Vice  The Purchase Infamy and Life the Price  'Tis not your Cause  Achilles'  injur'd Fame  Another's is the Crime but yours the Shame  Grant that our Chief offend thro' Rage or Lust  Must you be Cowards if your King's unjust  Prevent this Evil and your Country save  Small Thought retrieves the Spirits of the Brave  Think and subdue on Dastards dead to Fame  I waste no Anger for they feel no Shame  But you the Pride the Flow'r of all our Host  My Heart weeps blood to see your Glory lost  Nor deem this Day this Battel all you lose  A Day more black a Fate more vile ensues  Let each reflect who prizes Fame or Breath  On endless Infamy on instant Death  For lo the fated Time th' appointed Shore  Hark the Gates burst the brazen Barriers roar  Impetuous  Hector  thunders at the Wall  The Hour the Spot to conquer or to fall  These Words the  Grecians  fainting Hearts inspire  And list'ning Armies catch the godlike Fire  Fix'd at his Post was each bold  Ajax  found  With wellrang'd Squadrons strongly circled round  So close their Order so dispos'd their Fight  As  Pallas'  self might view with fixt Delight  Or had the God of War inclin'd his Eyes  The God of War had own'd a just Surprize  A chosen Phalanx firm resolv'd as Fate  Descending  Hector  and his Battel wait  An Iron Scene gleams dreadful o'er the Fields  Armour in Armour lock'd and Shields in Shields  Spears lean on Spears on Targets Targets throng  Helms stuck to Helms and Man drove Man along  The floating Plumes unnumber'd wave above  As when an Earthquake stirs the nodding Grove  And levell'd at the Skies with pointing Rays  Their brandish'd Lances at each Motion blaze  Thus breathing Death in terrible Array  The closecompacted Legions urg'd their way  Fierce they drove on impatient to destroy  Troy  charg'd the first and  Hector  first of  Troy  As from some Mountain's craggy Forehead torn  A Rock's round Fragment flies with Fury born  Which from the stubborn Stone a Torrent rends  Precipitate the pond'rous Mass descends  From Steep to Steep the rolling Ruin bounds  At ev'ry Shock the crackling Wood resounds  Still gath'ring Force it smoaks and urg'd amain  Whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the Plain  There stopsSo  Hector  Their whole Force he prov'd  Resistless when he rag'd and when he stop'd unmov'd  On him the War is bent the Darts are shed  And all their Faulchions wave around his Head  Repuls'd he stands nor from his Stand retires  But with repeated Shouts his Army fires  Trojans  be firm this Arm shall make your way  Thro' yon' square Body and that black Array  Stand and my Spear shall rout their scatt'ring Pow'r  Strong as they seem embattel'd like a Tow'r  For He that  Juno  's heav'nly Bosom warms  The first of Gods this Day inspires our Arms  He said and rouz'd the Soul in ev'ry Breast  Urg'd with Desire of Fame beyond the rest  Forth march'd  Deiphobus  but marching held  Before his wary Steps his ample Shield  Bold  Merion  aim'd a Stroke nor aim'd it wide  The glitt'ring Javelin pierc'd the tough Bullhide  But pierc'd not thro Unfaithful to his Hand  The Point broke short and sparkled in the Sand  The  Trojan  Warrior touch'd with timely Fear  On the rais'd Orb to distance bore the Spear  The  Greek  retreating mourn'd his frustrate Blow  And curs'd the treach'rous Lance that spar'd a Foe  Then to the Ships with surly Speed he went  To seek a surer Javelin in his Tent  Meanwhile with rising Rage the Battel glows  The Tumult thickens and the Clamour grows  By  Teucer  's Arm the warlike  Imbrius  bleeds  The Son of  Mentor  rich in gen'rous Steeds  E're yet to  Troy  the Sons of  Greece  were led  In fair  Pedaeus'  verdant Pastures bred  The Youth had dwelt remote from War's alarms  And bless'd in bright  Medesicaste  's Arms  This Nymph the Fruit of  Priam  's ravish'd Joy  Ally'd the Warrior to the House of  Troy    To  Troy  when Glory call'd his Arms he came  And match'd the bravest of her Chiefs in Fame  With  Priam  's Sons a Guardian of the Throne  He liv'd belov'd and honour'd as his own  Him  Teucer  pierc'd between the Throat and Ear  He groans beneath the  Telamonian  Spear  As from some farseen Mountain's airy Crown  Subdu'd by Steel a tall Ash tumbles down  And soils its verdant Tresses on the Ground  So falls the Youth his Arms the Fall resound  Then  Teucer  rushing to despoil the dead  From  Hector  's Hand a shining Javelin fled  He saw and shun'd the Death the forceful Dart  Sung on and pierc'd  Amphimachus  his Heart  Cteatus'  Son of  Neptune  's boasted Line  Vain was his Courage and his Race divine  Prostrate he falls his clanging Arms resound  And his broad Buckler thunders on the Ground  To seize his beamy Helm the Victor flies  And just had fastned on the dazling Prize  When  Ajax'  manly Arm a Javelin flung  Full on the Shield's round Boss the Weapon rung  He felt the Shock nor more was doom'd to feel  Secure in Mail and sheath'd in shining Steel  Repuls'd he yields the Victor  Greeks  obtain  The Spoils contested and bear off the slain  Between the Leaders of th'  Athenian  Line    Stichius  the brave  Menestheus  the divine  Deplor'd  Amphimachus  sad Object lies  Imbrius  remains the fierce  Ajaces'  Prize  As two grim Lyons bear across the Lawn  Snatch'd from devouring Hounds a slaughter'd Fawn  In their fell Jaws highlifted thro' the Wood  And sprinkling all the Shrubs with dropping Blood  So these the Chief Great  Ajax  from the dead  Strips his bright Arms  Oileus  lops his Head  Toss'd like a Ball and whirl'd in Air away  At  Hector  's Feet the goary Visage lay  The God of Ocean fir'd with stern Disdain  And pierc'd with Sorrow for his  Amphimachus  Grandson slain  Inspires the  Grecian  Hearts confirms their Hands  And breathes Destruction to the  Trojan  Bands  Swift as a Whirlwind rushing to the Fleet  He finds the Lancefam'd  Idomen  of  Crete  His pensive Brow the gen'rous Care exprest  With which a wounded Soldier touch'd his Breast  Whom in the Chance of War a Javelin tore  And his sad Comrades from the Battel bore  Him to the Surgeons of the Camp he sent  That Office paid he issu'd from his Tent  Fierce for the Fight To him the God begun  In  Thoas'  Voice  Andraemon  's valiant Son  Who rul'd where  Calydon  's white Rocks arise  And  Pleuron  's chalky Cliffs emblaze the Skies  Where's now th'imperious Vaunt the daring Boast  Of  Greece  victorious and proud  Ilion  lost  To whom the King On  Greece  no blame be thrown  Arms are her Trade and War is all her own  Her hardy Heroes from the wellfought Plains  Nor Fear withholds nor shameful Sloth detains  'Tis Heav'n alas and  Jove  's allpow'rful Doom  That far far distant from our native Home  Wills us to fall inglorious Oh my Friend  Once foremost in the Fight still prone to lend  Or Arms or Counsels now perform thy best  And what thou canst not singly urge the rest  Thus he and thus the God whose Force can make  The solid Globe's eternal Basis shake  Ah never may he see his native Land  But feed the Vulturs on this hateful Strand  Who seeks ignobly in his Ships to stay  Nor dares to combate on this signal Day  For this behold in horrid Arms I shine  And urge thy Soul to rival Acts with mine  Together let us battel on the Plain  Two not the worst nor ev'n this Succour vain  Not vain the weakest if their Force unite  But ours the bravest have confess'd in Fight  This said he rushes where the Combate burns  Swift to his Tent the  Cretan  King returns  From thence two Javelins glitt'ring in his Hand  And clad in Arms that lighten'd all the Strand  Fierce on the Foe th' impetuous Hero drove  Like Light'ning bursting from the Arm of  Jove  Which to pale Man the Wrath of Heav'n declares  Or terrifies th' offending World with Wars  In streamy Sparkles kindling all the Skies  From Pole to Pole the Trail of Glory flies  Thus his bright Armour o'er the dazled Throng  Gleam'd dreadful as the Monarch flash'd along  Him near his Tent  Meriones  attends  Whom thus he questions Ever best of Friends  O say in ev'ry Art of Battel skill'd  What holds thy Courage from so brave a Field  On some important Message art thou bound  Or bleeds my Friend by some unhappy Wound  Inglorious here my Soul abhors to stay  And glows with Prospects of th'approaching Day  O Prince  Meriones  replies whose Care  Leads forth th' embattel'd Sons of  Crete  to War  This speaks my Grief this headless Lance I wield  The rest lies rooted in a  Trojan  Shield  To whom the  Cretan  Enter and receive  The wanted Weapons those my Tent can give  Spears I have store and  Trojan  Lances all  That shed a Lustre round th' illumin'd Wall  Tho' I disdainful of the distant War  Nor trust the Dart or aim th' uncertain Spear  Yet hand to hand I fight and spoil the slain  And thence these Trophies and these Arms I gain  Enter and see on heaps the Helmets roll'd  And highhung spears and shields that flame with Gold  Nor vain said  Merion  are our martial Toils  We too can boast of no ignoble Spoils  But those my Ship contains whence distant far  I fight conspicuous in the Van of War  What need I more If any  Greek  there be  Who knows not  Merion  I appeal to thee  To this  Idomeneus  The Fields of Fight  Have prov'd thy Valour and unconquer'd Might  And were some Ambush for the Foes design'd  Ev'n there thy Courage would not lag behind  In that sharp Service singled from the rest  The Fear of each or Valour stands confest  No Force no Firmness the pale Coward shows  He shifts his Place his Colour comes and goes  A dropping Sweat creeps cold on ev'ry Part  Against his Bosom beats his quiv'ring Heart  Terror and Death in his wild Eyeballs stare  With chatt'ring Teeth he stands and stiff'ning Hair  And looks a bloodless Image of Despair  Not so the Bravestill dauntless still the same  Unchang'd his Colour and unmov'd his Frame  Compos'd his Thought determin'd is his Eye  And fix'd his Soul to conquer or to die  If ought disturb the Tenour of his Breast  'Tis but the Wish to strike before the rest  In such Assays thy blameless Worth is known  And ev'ry Art of dang'rous War thy own  By chance of Fight whatever Wounds you bore  Those Wounds were glorious all and all before  Such as may teach 'twas still thy brave Delight  T' oppose thy Bosom where the foremost fight  But why like Infants cold to Honour's Charms  Stand we to talk when Glory calls to Arms  Gofrom my conquer'd Spears the choicest take  And to their Owners send them nobly back  Swift as the Word bold  Merion  snatch'd a Spear  And breathing Slaughter follow'd to the War  So  Mars  Armipotent invades the Plain  The wide Destroyer of the Race of Man  Terror  his best lov'd Son attends his Course  Arm'd with stern Boldness and enormous Force  The Pride of haughty Warriors to confound  And lay the Strength of Tyrants on the Ground  From  Thrace  they fly call'd to the dire Alarms  Of warring  Phlegyans  and  Ephyrian  Arms  Invok'd by both relentless they dispose  To these glad Conquest murd'rous Rout to those  So march'd the Leaders of the  Cretan  Train  And their bright Arms shot Horror o'er the Plain  Then first spake  Merion  Shall we join the Right  Or combate in the Centre of the Fight  Or to the Left our wanted Succour lend  Hazard and Fame all Parts alike attend  Not in the Centre  Idomen  reply'd  Our ablest Chieftains the main Battel guide  Each godlike  Ajax  makes that Post his Care  And gallant  Teucer  deals Destruction there  Skill'd or with Shafts to gall the distant Field  Or bear close Battel on the sounding Shield  These can the Rage of haughty  Hector  tame  Safe in their Arms the Navy fears no Flame  Till  Jove  himself descends his Bolts to shed  And hurl the blazing Ruin at our Head  Great must he be of more than human Birth  Nor feed like Mortals on the Fruits of Earth  Him neither Rocks can crush nor Steel can wound  Whom  Ajax  fells not on th' ensanguin'd Ground  In standing Fight he mates  Achilles'  Force  Excell'd alone in Swiftness in the Course  Then to the Left our ready Arms apply  And live with Glory or with Glory die  He said and  Merion  to th' appointed Place  Fierce as the God of Battels urg'd his Pace  Soon as the Foe the shining Chiefs beheld  Rush like a fiery Torrent o'er the Field  Their Force embody'd in a Tyde they pour  The rising Combate sounds along the Shore  As warring Winds in  Sirius'  sultry Reign  From diff'rent Quarters sweep the sandy Plain  On ev'ry side the dusty Whirlwinds rise  And the dry Fields are lifted to the Skies  Thus by Despair Hope Rage together driv'n  Met the black Hosts and meeting darken'd Heav'n  All dreadful glar'd the Iron Face of War  Bristled with upright Spears that flash'd afar  Dire was the Gleam of Breastplates Helms and Shields  And polish'd Arms emblaz'd the flaming Fields  Tremendous Scene that gen'ral Horror gave  But touch'd with Joy the Bosoms of the Brave  Saturn  's great Sons in fierce Contention vy'd  And Crowds of Heroes in their Anger dy'd  The Sire of Earth and Heav'n by  Thetis  won  To crown with Glory  Peleus'  godlike Son  Will'd not Destruction to the  Grecian  Pow'rs  But spar'd a while the destin'd  Trojan  Tow'rs  While  Neptune  rising from his azure Main  Warr'd on the King of Heav'n with stern Disdain  And breath'd Revenge and fir'd the  Grecian  Train  Gods of one Source of one ethereal Race  Alike divine and Heav'n their native Place  But  Jove  the greater Firstborn of the Skies  And more than Men or Gods supremely wise  For this of  Jove  's superior Might afraid  Neptune  in human Form conceal'd his Aid  These Pow'rs inclose the  Greek  and  Trojan  Train  In War and Discord's adamantine Chain  Indissolubly strong the fatal Tye  Is stretch'd on both and Heaps on Heaps they dye  Dreadful in Arms and grown in Combats grey  The bold  Idomeneus  controuls the Day  First by his Hand  Othryoneus  was slain  Swell'd with false Hopes with mad Ambition vain  Call'd by the Voice of War to martial Fame  From high  Cabesus'  distant Walls he came  Cassandra  's Love he sought with Boasts of Pow'r  And promis'd Conquest was the proffer'd Dow'r  The King consented by his Vaunts abus'd  The King consented but the Fates refus'd  Proud of himself and of th' imagin'd Bride  The Field he measur'd with a larger Stride  Him as he stalk'd the  Cretan  Javelin found  Vain was his Breastplate to repel the Wound  His Dream of Glory lost he plung'd to Hell  The Plains resounded as the Boaster fell  The great  Idomeneus  bestrides the dead  And thus he cries behold thy Promise sped  Such is the Help thy Arms to  Ilion  bring  And such the Contract of the  Phrygian  King  Our Offers now illustrious Prince receive  For such an Aid what will not  Argos  give  To conquer  Troy  with ours thy Forces join  And count  Atrides'  fairest Daughter thine  Meantime on farther Methods to advise  Come follow to the Fleet thy new Allies  There hear what  Greece  has on her Part to say  He spoke and dragg'd the goary Corse away  This  Asius  view'd unable to contain  Before his Chariot warring on the Plain  His valu'd Coursers to his Squire consign'd  Impatient panted on his Neck behind  To Vengeance rising with a sudden Spring  He hop'd the Conquest of the  Cretan  King  The wary  Cretan  as his Foe drew near  Full on his Throat discharg'd the forceful Spear  Beneath the Chin the Point was seen to glide  And glitter'd extant at the farther side  As when the Mountain Oak or Poplar tall  Or Pine fit Mast for some great Admiral  Groans to the oftheav'd Axe with many a Wound  Then spreads a length of Ruin o'er the Ground  So sunk proud  Asius  in that deathful Day  And stretch'd before his muchlov'd Coursers lay  He grinds the Dust distain'd with streaming Gore  And fierce in Death lies foaming on the Shore  Depriv'd of Motion stiff with stupid Fear  Stands all aghast his trembling Charoteer  Nor shuns the Foe nor turns the Steeds away  But falls transfix'd an unresisting Prey  Pierc'd by  Antilochus  he pants beneath  The stately Car and labours out his Breath  Thus  Asius'  Steeds their mighty Master gone  Remain the Prize of  Nestor  's youthful Son  Stabb'd at the Sight  Deiphobus  drew nigh  And made with force the vengeful Weapon fly  The  Cretan  saw and stooping caus'd to glance  From his slope Shield the disappointed Lance  Beneath the spacious Targe a blazing Round  Thick with Bullhides with brazen Orbits bound  On his rais'd Arm by two strong Braces stay'd  He lay collected in defensive Shade  O'er his safe Head the Javelin idly sung  And on the tincling Verge more faintly rung  Ev'n then the Spear the vig'rous Arm confest  And pierc'd obliquely King  Hypsenor  's Breast  Warm'd in his Liver to the Ground it bore  The Chief his People's Guardian now no more  Not unattended the proud  Trojan  cries  Nor unreveng'd lamented  Asius  lies  For thee tho' Hell's black Portals stand display'd  This Mate shall joy thy melancholy Shade  Heartpiercing Anguish at this haughty Boast  Touch'd ev'ry  Greek  but  Nestor  's Son the most  Griev'd as he was his pious Arms attend  And his broad Buckler shields his slaughter'd Friend  Till sad  Mecistheus  and  Alastor  bore  His honour'd Body to the Tented Shore  Nor yet from Fight  Idomeneus  withdraws  Resolv'd to perish in his Country's Cause  Or find some Foe whom Heav'n and he shall doom  To wail his Fate in Death's eternal Gloom  He sees  Alcathous  in the Front aspire  Great  Aesyetes  was the Hero's Sire  His Spouse  Hippodamè  divinely fair  Anchises'  eldest Hope and darling Care  Who charm'd her Parent's and her Husband's Heart  With Beauty Sense and ev'ry Work of Art  He once of  Ilion  's Youth the loveliest Boy  The fairest she of all the Fair of  Troy  By  Neptune  now the hapless Hero dies  Who covers with a Cloud those beauteous Eyes  And fetters ev'ry Limb yet bent to meet  His Fate he stands nor shuns the Lance of  Crete  Fixt as some Column or deeprooted Oak  While the Winds sleep his Breast receiv'd the Stroke  Before the pond'rous Stroke his Corselet yields  Long us'd to ward the Death in fighting Fields  The riven Armour sends a jarring Sound  His lab'ring Heart heaves with so strong a bound  The long Lance shakes and vibrates in the Wound  Fastflowing from its Source as prone he lay  Life's purple Tyde impetuous gush'd away  Then  Idomen  insulting o'er the slain  Behold  Deiphobus  nor vaunt in vain  See on one  Greek  three  Trojan  Ghosts attend  This my third Victim to the Shades I send  Approaching now thy boasted Might approve  And try the Prowess of the Seed of  Jove  From  Jove  enamour'd on a mortal Dame  Great  Minos  Guardian of his Country came  Deucalion  blameless Prince was  Minos'  Heir  His Firstborn I the third from  Jupiter  O'er spacious  Crete  and her bold Sons I reign  And thence my Ships transport me thro' the Main  Lord of a Host o'er all my Host I shine  A Scourge to thee thy Father and thy Line  The  Trojan  heard uncertain or to meet  Alone with vent'rous Arms the King of  Crete  Or seek auxiliar Force at length decreed  To call some Hero to partake the Deed  Forthwith  Aeneas  rises to his Thought  For him in  Troy  's remotest Lines he sought  Where he incens'd at partial  Priam  stands  And sees superior Posts in meaner Hands  To him ambitious of so great an Aid  The bold  Deïphobus  approach'd and said  Now  Trojan  Prince employ thy pious Arms  If e'er thy Bosom felt fair Honour's Charms  Alcathous  dies thy Brother and thy Friend  Come and the Warrior's lov'd Remains defend  Beneath his Cares thy early Youth was train'd  One Table fed you and one Roof contain'd  This Deed to fierce  Idomeneus  we owe  Haste and revenge it on th' insulting Foe  Aeneas  heard and for a Space resign'd  To tender Pity all his manly Mind  Then rising in his Rage he burns to fight  The  Greek  awaits him with collected Might  As the fell Boar on some rough Mountain's Head  Arm'd with wild Terrors and to Slaughter bred  When the loud Rusticks rise and shout from far  Attends the Tumult and expects the War  O'er his bent Back the bristly Horrors rise  Fires stream in Light'ning from his sanguin Eyes  His foaming Tusks both Dogs and Men engage  But most his Hunters rouze his mighty Rage  So stood  Idomeneus  his Javelin shook  And met the  Trojan  with a low'ring Look  Antilochus Deipyrus  were near  The youthful Offspring of the God of War  Merion  and  Aphareus  in Field renown'd  To these the Warrior sent his Voice around  Fellows in Arms your timely Aid unite  Lo great  Aeneas  rushes to the Fight  Sprung from a God and more than Mortal bold  He fresh in Youth and I in Arms grown old  Else should this Hand this Hour decide the Strife  The great Dispute of Glory or of Life  He spoke and all as with one Soul obey'd  Their lifted Bucklers cast a dreadful Shade  Around the Chief  Aeneas  too demands  Th' assisting Forces of his native Bands  Paris Deïphobus Agenor  join  Coaids and Captains of the  Trojan  Line  In order follow all th' embody'd Train  Like  Ida  's Flocks proceeding o'er the Plain  Before his fleecy Care erect and bold  Stalks the proud Ram the Father of the Fold  With Joy the Swain surveys them as he leads  To the cool Fountains thro' the wellknown Meads  So joys  Aeneas  as his native Band  Moves on in Rank and stretches o'er the Land  Round dead  Alcathous  now the Battel rose  On ev'ry side the steely Circle grows  Now batter'd Breastplates and hack'd Helmets ring  And o'er their Heads unheeded Javelins sing  Above the rest two tow'ring Chiefs appear  There great  Idomeneus Aeneas  here  Like Gods of War dispensing Fate they stood  And burn'd to drench the Ground with mutual Blood  The  Trojan  Weapon whizz'd along in Air  The  Cretan  saw and shun'd the brazen Spear  Sent from an Arm so strong the missive Wood  Stuck deep in Earth and quiver'd where it stood  But  Oenomas  receiv'd the  Cretan  's stroke  The forceful Spear his hollow Corselet broke  It ripp'd his Belly with a ghastly Wound  And roll'd the smoaking Entrails to the Ground  Stretch'd on the Plain he sobs away his Breath  And furious grasps the bloody Dust in Death  The Victor from his Breast the Weapon tears  His Spoils he could not for the Show'r of Spears  Tho' now unfit an active War to wage  Heavy with cumb'rous Arms stiff with cold Age  His listless Limbs unable for the Course  In standing Fight he yet maintains his Force  Till faint with Labour and by Foes repell'd  His tir'd slow Steps he drags from off the Field  Deiphobus  beheld him as he past  And fir'd with Hate a parting Javelin cast  The Javelin err'd but held its Course along  And pierc'd  Ascalaphus  the brave and young  The Son of  Mars  fell gasping on the Ground  And gnash'd the Dust all bloody with his Wound  Nor knew the furious Father of his Fall  Highthron'd amidst the great  Olympian  Hall  On golden Clouds th' immortal Synod sate  Detain'd from bloody War by  Jove  and  Fate  Now where in Dust the breathless Hero lay  For slain  Ascalaphus  commenc'd the Fray  Deiphobus  to seize his Helmet flies  And from his Temples rends the glitt'ring Prize  Valiant as  Mars Meriones  drew near  And on his loaded Arm discharg'd his Spear  He drops the Weight disabled with the Pain  The hollow Helmet rings against the Plain  Swift as a Vultur leaping on his Prey  From his torn Arm the  Grecian  rent away  The reeking Javelin and rejoin'd his Friends  His wounded Brother good  Polites  tends  Around his Waste his pious Arms he threw  And from the Rage of Combate gently drew  Him his swift Coursers on his splendid Car  Rapt from the less'ning Thunder of the War  To  Troy  they drove him groaning from the Shore  And sprinkling as he past the Sands with Gore  Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguin ground  Heaps fall on Heaps and Heav'n and Earth resound  Bold  Aphareus  by great  Aeneas  bled  As tow'rd the Chief he turn'd his daring Head  He pierc'd his Throat the bending Head deprest  Beneath his Helmet nods upon his Breast  His Shield revers'd o'er the fall'n Warror lies  And everlasting Slumber seals his Eyes  Antilochus  as  Thoon  turn'd him round  Transpierc'd his Back with a dishonest Wound  The hollow Vein that to the Neck extends  Along the Chine his eager Javelin rends  Supine he falls and to his social Train  Spreads his imploring Arms but spreads in vain  Th' exulting Victor leaping where he lay  From his broad Shoulders tore the Spoils away  His Time observ'd for clos'd by Foes around  On all sides thick the Peals of Arms resound  His Shield emboss'd the ringing Storm sustains  But he impervious and untouch'd remains  Great  Neptune  's Care preserv'd from hostile Rage  This Youth the Joy of  Nestor  's glorious Age  In Arms intrepid with the first he fought  Fac'd ev'ry Foe and ev'ry Danger sought  His winged Lance resistless as the Wind  Obeys each Motion of the Master's Mind  Restless it flies impatient to be free  And meditates the distant Enemy  The Son of  Asius Adamas  drew near  And struck his Target with the brazen Spear  Fierce in his Front but  Neptune  wards the Blow  And blunts the Javelin of th' eluded Foe  In the broad Buckler half the Weapon stood  Splinter'd on Earth flew half the broken Wood  Disarm'd he mingled in the  Trojan  Crew  But  Merion  's Spear o'ertook him as he flew  Deep in the Belly's Rim an Entrance found  Where sharp the Pang and mortal is the Wound  Bending he fell and doubled to the Ground  Lay panting Thus an Oxe in Fetters ty'd  While Death's strong Pangs distend his lab'ring Side  His Bulk enormous on the Field displays  His heaving Heart beats thick as ebbing Life decays  The Spear the Conqu'ror from his Body drew  And Death's dim Shadows swam before his View  Next brave  Deipyrus  in Dust was lay'd  King  Helenus  wav'd high the  Thracian  Blade  And smote his Temples with an Arm so strong  The Helm fell off and roll'd amid the Throng  There for some luckier  Greek  it rests a Prize  For dark in Death the godlike Owner lies  With raging Grief great  Menelaus  burns  And fraught with Vengeance to the Victor turns  That shook the pond'rous Lance in Act to throw  And this stood adverse with the bended Bow  Full on his Breast the  Trojan  Arrow fell  But harmless bounded from the plated Steel  As on some ample Barn's wellharden'd Floor  The Winds collected at each open Door  While the broad Fan with Force is whirl'd around  Lightleaps the golden grain resulting from the ground  So from the Steel that guards  Atrides'  Heart  Repell'd to distance flies the bounding Dart  Atrides  watchful of th' unwary Foe  Pierc'd with his Lance the Hand that grasp'd the Bow  And nail'd it to the Eugh The wounded Hand  Trail'd the long Lance that mark'd with Blood the Sand  But good  Agenor  gently from the Wound  The Spear sollicites and the Bandage bound  A Slings soft Wool snatch'd from a Soldier's side  At once the Tent and Ligature supply'd  Behold  Pisander  urg'd by Fate's Decree  Springs thro' the Ranks to fall and fall by thee  Great  Menelaus  to enhance thy Fame  Hightow'ring in the Front the Warrior came  First the sharp Lance was by  Atrides  thrown  The Lance far distant by the Winds was blown  Nor pierc'd  Pisander  thro'  Atrides'  Shield  Pisander  's Spear fell shiver'd on the Field  Not so discourag'd to the Future blind  Vain Dreams of Conquest swell his haughty Mind  Dauntless he rushes where the  Spartan  Lord  Like Light'ning brandish'd his farbeaming Sword  His left Arm high oppos'd the shining Shield  His right beneath the cover'd PoleAxe held  An Olive's cloudy Grain the Handle made  Distinct with Studs and brazen was the Blade  This on the Helm discharg'd a noble Blow  The Plume dropp'd nodding to the Plain below  Shorn from the Crest  Atrides  wav'd his Steel  Deep thro' his Front the weighty Faulchion fell  The crashing Bones before its Force gave way  In Dust and Blood the groaning Hero lay  Forc'd from their ghastly Orbs and spouting Gore  The clotted Eyeballs tumble on the Shore  The fierce  Atrides  spurn'd him as he bled  Tore off his Arms and loudexulting said  Thus  Trojans  thus at length be taught to fear  O Race perfidious who delight in War  Already noble Deeds ye have perform'd  A Princess rap'd transcends a Navy storm'd  In such bold Feats your impious Might approve  Without th'Assistance or the Fear of  Jove  The violated Rites the ravish'd Dame  Our Heroes slaughter'd and our Ships on flame  Crimes heap'd on Crimes shall bend your Glory down  And whelm in Ruins yon' flagitious Town  O thou great Father Lord of Earth and Skies  Above the Thought of Man supremely wise  If from thy Hand the Fates of Mortals flow  From whence this favour to an impious Foe  A godless Crew abandon'd and unjust  Still breathing Rapine Violence and Lust  The best of Things beyond their Measure cloy  Sleeps balmy Blessing Love's endearing Joy  The Feast the Dance whate'er Mankind desire  Ev'n the sweet Charms of sacred Numbers tire  But  Troy  for ever reaps a dire Delight  In Thirst of Slaughter and in Lust of Fight  This said he seiz'd while yet the Carcass heav'd  The bloody Armour which his Train receiv'd  Then sudden mix'd among the warring Crew  And the bold Son of  Pylaemenes  slew  Harpalion  had thro'  Asia  travell'd far  Following his martial Father to the War  Thro' filial Love he left his native Shore  Never ah never to behold it more  His unsuccessful Spear he chanc'd to fling  Against the Target of the  Spartan  King  Thus of his Lance disarm'd from Death he flies  And turns around his apprehensive Eyes  Him thro' the Hip transpiercing as he fled  The Shaft of  Merion  mingled with the dead  Beneath the Bone the glancing Point descends  And driving down the swelling Bladder rends  Sunk in his sad Companion's Arms he lay  And in short Pantings sobb'd his Soul away  Like some vile Worm extended on the Ground  While Life's red Torrent gush'd from out the Wound  Him on his Car the  Paphlagonian  Train  In slow Procession bore from off the Plain  The pensive Father Father now no more  Attends the mournful Pomp along the Shore  And unavailing Tears profusely shed  And unreveng'd deplor'd his Offspring dead  Paris  from far the moving Sight beheld  With Pity soften'd and with Fury swell'd  His honour'd Host a Youth of matchless Grace  And lov'd of all the  Paphlagonian  Race  With his full Strength he bent his angry Bow  And wing'd the feather'd Vengeance at the Foe  A Chief there was the brave  Euchenor  nam'd  For Riches much and more for Virtue fam'd  Who held his Seat in  Corinth  's stately Town  Polydus'  Son a Seer of old Renown  Oft' had the Father told his early Doom  By Arms abroad or slow Disease at home  He climb'd his Vessel prodigal of Breath  And chose the certain glorious Path to Death  Beneath his Ear the pointed Arrow went  The Soul came issuing at the narrow Vent  His Limbs unnerv'd drop useless on the Ground  And everlasting Darkness shades him round  Nor knew great  Hector  how his Legions yield  Wrapt in the Cloud and Tumult of the Field  Wide on the Left the Force of  Greece  commands  And Conquest hovers o'er th'  Achaian  Bands  With such a Tyde superior Virtue sway'd  And  Neptune  he that shakes the solid Earth gave Aid  But in the Centre  Hector  fix'd remain'd  Where first the Gates were forc'd and Bulwarks gain'd  There on the Margin of the hoary Deep  Their Naval Station where th'  Ajaces  keep  And where low Walls confine the beating Tydes  Whose humble Barrier scarce the Foes divides  Where late in Fight both Foot and Horse engag'd  And all the Thunder of the Battel rag'd  There join'd the whole  Boeotian  Strength remains  The proud  Ionians  with their sweeping Trains  Locrians  and  Pthians  and th'  Epaean  Force  But join'd repel not  Hector  's fiery Course  The Flow'r of  Athens Stichius Phidas  led  Bias  and great  Menestheus  at their Head  Meges  the strong th'  Epeian  Bands controul'd  And  Dracius  prudent and  Amphion  bold  The  Pthians Medon  fam'd for martial Might  And brave  Podarces  active in the Fight  This drew from  Phylacus  his noble Line  Iphyclus'  Son and that  Oileus  thine  Young  Ajax  Brother by a stol'n Embrace  He dwelt far distant from his native Place  By his fierce Stepdame from his Father's Reign  Expell'd and exil'd for her Brother slain  These rule the  Pthians  and their Arms employ  Mixt with  Boeotians  on the Shores of  Troy  Now side by side with like unweary'd Care  Each  Ajax  labour'd thro' the Field of War  So when two lordly Bulls with equal Toil  Force the bright Plowshare thro' the fallow Soil  Join'd to one Yoke the stubborn Earth they tear  And trace large Furrows with the shining Share  O'er their huge Limbs the Foam descends in Snow  And Streams of Sweat down their sow'r Foreheads flow  A Train of Heroes follow'd thro' the Field  Who bore by turns great  Ajax'  sev'nfold Shield  Whene'er he breath'd remissive of his Might  Tir'd with th' incessant Slaughters of the Fight  His brave Associate had no following Band  His Troops unpractis'd in the Fights of Stand  For not the Spear the  Locrian  Squadrons wield  Nor bear the Helm nor lift the moony Shield  But skill'd from far the flying Shaft to wing  Or whirl the sounding Pebble from the Sling  Dext'rous with these they aim a certain Wound  Or fell the distant Warrior to the Ground  Thus in the Van the  Telamonian  Train  Throng'd in bright Arms a pressing Fight maintain  Far in the Rear the  Locrian  Archers lie  Thick Stones and Arrows intercept the Sky  The mingled Tempest on the Foes they pour  Troy  's scatt'ring Orders open to the Show'r  Now had the  Greeks  eternal Fame acquir'd  And the gall'd  Ilians  to their Walls retir'd  But sage  Polydamas  discreetly brave  Address'd great  Hector  and this Counsel gave  Tho' great in all thou seem'st averse to lend  Impartial Audience to a faithful Friend  To Gods and Men thy matchless Worth is known  And ev'ry Art of glorious War thy own  But in cool Thought and Counsel to excel  How widely differs this from warring well  Content with what the bounteous Gods have giv'n  Seek not alone t'engross the Gifts of Heav'n  To some the Pow'rs of bloody War belong  To some sweet Music and the Charm of Song  To few and wond'rous few has  Jove  assign'd  A wise extensive allconsid'ring Mind  Their Guardians these the Nations round confess  And Towns and Empires for their Safety bless  If Heav'n have lodg'd this Virtue in my Breast  Attend O  Hector  what I judge the best  See as thou mov'st on Dangers Dangers spread  And Wars whole Fury burns around thy Head  Behold distress'd within yon' hostile Wall  How many  Trojans  yield disperse or fall  What Troops outnumber'd scarce the War maintain  And what brave Heroes at the Ships lie slain  Here cease thy Fury and the Chiefs and Kings  Convok'd to Council weigh the Sum of things  Whether the Gods succeeding our Desires  To yon' tall Ships to bear the  Trojan  Fires  Or quit the Fleet and pass unhurt away  Contented with the Conquest of the Day  I fear I fear lest  Greece  not yet undone  Pay the large Debt of last revolving Sun  Achilles  great  Achilles  yet remains  On yonder Decks and yet o'erlooks the Plains  The Counsel pleas'd and  Hector  with a Bound  Leap'd from his Chariot on the trembling Ground  Swift as he leap'd his clanging Arms resound  To guard this Post he cry'd thy Art employ  And here detain the scatter'd Youth of  Troy  Where yonder Heroes faint I bend my way  And hasten back to end the doubtful Day  This said the tow'ring Chief prepar'd to go  Shakes his white Plumes that to the Breezes flow  And seems a moving Mountain topt with Snow  Thro' all his Host inspiring Force he flies  And bids anew the martial Thunder rise  To  Panthus'  Son at  Hector  's high Command  Haste the bold Leaders of the  Trojan  Band  But round the Battlements and round the Plain  For many a Chief he look'd but look'd in vain  Deiphobus  nor  Helenus  the Seer  Nor  Asius'  Son nor  Asius'  self appear  For these were pierc'd with many a ghastly Wound  Some cold in Death some groaning on the Ground  Some low in Dust a mournful Object lay  High on the Wall some breath'd their Souls away  Far on the Left amid the Throng he found  Cheering the Troops and dealing Deaths around  The graceful  Paris  whom with Fury mov'd  Opprobrious thus th' impatient Chief reprov'd  Illfated  Paris  Slave to Womankind  As smooth of Face as fraudulent of Mind  Where is  Deiphobus  where  Asius  gone  The godlike Father and th' intrepid Son  The Force of  Helenus  dispensing Fate  And great  Othryoneus  so fear'd of late  Black Fate hangs o'er thee from th' avenging Gods  Imperial  Troy  from her Foundations nods  Whelm'd in thy Country's Ruins shalt thou fall  And one devouring Vengeance swallow all  When  Paris  thus My Brother and my Friend  Thy warm Impatience makes thy Tongue offend  In other Battels I deserv'd thy Blame  Tho' then not deedless nor unknown to Fame  But since yon' Rampart by thy Arms lay low  I scatter'd Slaughter from my fatal Bow  The Chiefs you seek on yonder Shore lie slain  Of all those Heroes two alone remain  Deiphobus  and  Helenus  the Seer  Each now disabled by a hostile Spear  Go then successful where thy Soul inspires  This Heart and Hand shall second all thy Fires  What with this Arm I can prepare to know  Till Death for Death be paid and Blow for Blow  But 'tis not ours with Forces not our own  To combate Strength is of the Gods alone  These Words the Hero's angry Mind asswage  Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage  Around  Polydamas  distain'd with Blood  Cebrion Phalces  stern  Orthaeus  stood  Palmus  with  Polypaetes  the divine  And two bold Brothers of  Hippotion  's Line  Who reach'd fair  Ilion  from  Ascania  far  The former Day the next engag'd in War  As when from gloomy Clouds a Whirlwind springs  That bears  Jove  's Thunder on its dreadful Wings  Wide o'er the blasted Fields the Tempest sweeps  Then gather'd settles on the hoary Deeps  Th' afflicted Deeps tumultuous mix and roar  The Waves behind impel the Waves before  Widerolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore  Thus Rank on Rank the thick Battalions throng  Chief urg'd on Chief and Man drove Man along  Far o'er the Plains in dreadful Order bright  The brazen Arms reflect a beamy Light  Full in the blazing Van great  Hector  shin'd  Like  Mars  commission'd to confound Mankind  Before him flaming his enormous Shield  Like the broad Sun illumin'd all the Field  His nodding Helm emits a streamy Ray  His piercing Eyes thro' all the Battel stray  And while beneath his Targe he flash'd along  Shot Terrors round that wither'd ev'n the Strong  Thus stalk'd he dreadful Death was in his Look  Whole Nations fear'd but not an  Argive  shook  The tow'ring  Ajax  with an ample Stride  Advanc'd the first and thus the Chief defy'd  Hector  come on thy empty Threats forbear  'Tis not thy Arm 'tis thund'ring  Jove  we fear  The Skill of War to us not idly giv'n  Lo  Greece  is humbled not by  Troy  but Heav'n  Vain are the Hopes that haughty Mind imparts  To force our Fleet The  Greeks  have hands and hearts  Long e'er in Flames our lofty Navy fall  Your boasted City and your godbuilt Wall  Shall sink beneath us smoaking on the Ground  And spread a long unmeasur'd Ruin round  The time shall come when chas'd along the Plain  Ev'n thou shalt call on  Jove  and call in vain  Ev'n thou shalt wish to aid thy desp'rate Course  The Wings of Falcons for thy flying Horse  Shalt run forgetful of a Warrior's Fame  While Clouds of friendly Dust conceal thy Shame  As thus he spoke behold in open View  On sounding Wings a dexter Eagle flew  To  Jove  's glad Omen all the  Grecians  rise  And hail with Shouts his Progress thro' the Skies  Farechoing Clamours bound from side to side  They ceas'd and thus the Chief of  Troy  reply'd  From whence this Menace this insulting Strain  Enormous Boaster doom'd to vaunt in vain  So may the Gods on  Hector  Life bestow  Not that short Life which Mortals lead below  But such as those of  Jove  's high Lineage born  The blueey'd Maid or he that gilds the Morn  As this decisive Day shall end the Fame  Of  Greece  and  Argos  be no more a Name  And thou Imperious if thy Madness wait  The Lance of  Hector  thou shalt meet thy Fate  That GiantCorse extended on the Shore  Shall largely feast the Fowls with Fat and Gore  He said and like a Lion stalk'd along  With Shouts incessant Earth and Ocean rung  Sent from his follo'wing Host The  Grecian  Train  With answ'ring Thunders fill'd the echoing Plain  A Shout that tore Heav'ns Concave and above  Shook the fix'd Splendors of the Throne of  Jove  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Thirteenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRTEENTH BOOK  I  VERSE ONE might fancy at the first reading of this Passage that  Homer  here turn'd aside from the main View of his Poem in a vain Ostentation of Learning to amuse himself with a foreign and unnecessary Description of the Manners and Customs of these Nations But we shall find upon better Consideration that  Jupiter  's turning aside his Eyes was necessary to the Conduct of the Work as it gives Opportunity to  Neptune  to assist the  Greeks  and thereby causes all the Adventures of this Book Madam  Dacier  is too refining on this occasion when she would have it that  Jupiter  's  averting his Eyes  signifies his abandoning the  Trojans  in the same manner as the Scripture represents the Almighty  turning his Face  from those whom he deserts But at this rate  Jupiter  turning his Eyes from the Battel must desert both the  Trojans  and the  Greeks  and it is evident from the Context that  Jupiter  intended nothing less than to let the  Trojans  suffer  II  VERSE  And where the farfam'd  Hippemolgian  strays    There is much dispute among the Criticks which are the proper Names and which the Epithets in these Verses Some making  the Epithet to  others  the Epithet to  and  which by the common Interpreters is thought only an Epithet is by  Strabo  and  Ammianus Marcellinus  made the proper Name of a People In this Diversity of Opinions I have chosen that which I thought would make the best Figure in Poetry It is a beautiful and moral Imagination to suppose that the long Life of the  Hippemolgians  was an Effect of their simple Diet and a Reward of their Justice And that the supreme Being displeas'd at the continued Scenes of human Violence and Dissension as it were recreated his Eyes in contemplating the Simplicity of these People  It is observable that the same Custom of living on Milk is preserv'd to this Day by the  Tartars  who inhabit the same Country  III  VERSE  At  Jove  incens'd with Grief and Fury stung  Prone down the rocky Steep he rush'd    Mons  de la Motte  has play'd the Critick upon this Passage a little unadvisedly  "  Neptune  says he is impatient to assist the  Greeks Homer  tells us that this God goes first to seek his Chariot in a certain Place next he arrives at another Place nearer the Camp there he takes off his Horses and then he locks them fast to secure them at his Return The Detail of so many little Particularities no way suits the Majesty of a God or the Impatience in which he is described"  Another  French  Writer makes answer that however impatient  Neptune  is represented to be none of the Gods ever go to the War without their Arms and the Arms Chariot and Horses of  Neptune  were at  Aegae  He makes but four Steps to get thither so that what M  de  la Motte  calls being slow is Swiftness itself The God puts on his Arms mounts his Chariot and departs nothing is more rapid than his Course he flies over the Waters the Verses of  Homer  in that Place run swifter than the God himself It is sufficient to have Ears to perceive the Rapidity of  Neptune  's Chariot in the very Sound of those three Lines each of which is entirely compos'd of Dactyles excepting that one Spondee which must necessarily terminate the Verse  IV  VERSE  The lofty Mountains nod  The Forests shake Earth trembled as he trod  And felt the Footsteps of th' immortal God    Longinus  confesses himself wonderfully struck with the Sublimity of this Passage That Critick after having blam'd the Defects with which  Homer  draws the Manners of his Gods adds that he has much better succeeded in describing their Figure and Persons He owns that he often paints a God such as he is in all his Majesty and Grandeur and without any Mixture of mean and terrestrial Images of which he produces this Passage as a remarkable Instance and one that had challeng'd the Admiration of all Antiquity  The Book of  Psalms  affords us a Description of the like sublime manner of Imagery which is parallel to this  O God when thou wentest forth before thy People when thou didst march through the Wilderness the Earth shook the Heavens dropped at the Presence of God even  Sinai  itself was moved at the Presence of God the God of  Israel Ps  V  VERSE  Three ample Strides he took    This is a very grand Imagination and equals if not transcends the Sublimity of what he has feign'd before of the Passage of this  God We are told that at four Steps he reach'd  Aegae  which supposing it meant of the Town of that Name in  Euboea  which lay the nighest to  Thrace  is hardly less than a Degree at each Step One may from a View of the Map imagine him striding from Promontory to Promontory his first Step on Mount  Athos  his second on  Pallene  his third upon  Pelion  and his fourth in  Euboea Dacier  is not to be forgiven for omitting this miraculous Circumstance which so perfectly agrees with the marvellous Air of the whole Passage and without which the sublime Image of  Homer  is not compleat  VI  VERSE  The distant Aegae shook    There were three Places of this Name which were all sacred to  Neptune  an Island in the  Aegean  Sea mention'd by  Nicostratus  a Town in  Peloponnesus  and another in  Euboea Homer  is supposed in this Passage to speak of the last but the Question is put why  Neptune  who stood upon a Hill in  Samothrace  instead of going on the left to  Troy  turns to the right and takes a way contrary to that which leads to the Army This Difficulty is ingeniously solv'd by the old Scholiast who says that  Jupiter  being now on Mount  Ida  with his Eyes turn'd towards  Thrace Neptune  could not take the direct way from  Samothrace  to  Troy  without being discover'd by him and therefore fetches this Compass to conceal himself  Eustathius  is contented to say that the Poet made  Neptune  go so far about for the Opportunity of those fine Descriptions of the Palace the Chariot and the Passage of this God  VII  VERSE  Th' enormous Monsters rolling o'er the Deep    This Description of  Neptune  rises upon us his Passage by Water is yet more pompous than that by Land The God driving thro' the Seas the Whales acknowledging him and the Waves rejoicing and making way for their Monarch are full of that  Marvellous  so natural to the Imagination of our  Author And I cannot but think the Verses of  Virgil  in the fifth  Aeneid  are short of his Original  Coeruleo per summa levis volat aequora curru  Subsidunt undae tumidum{que} sub axe tonanti  Sternitur aequor aquis fugiunt vasto aethere nimbi  Tum variae comitum facies immania cete  c  I fancy  Scaliger  himself was sensible of this by his passing in Silence a Passage which lay so obvious to Comparison  VIII  VERSE  This Part o'erthrown  Our Strength were vain I dread for you alone    What Address and at the same time what Strength is there in these Words  Neptune  tells the two  Ajaces  that he is only afraid for their Post and that the  Greeks  will perish by that Gate since it is  Hector  who assaults it at every other Quarter the  Trojans  will be repuls'd It may therefore be properly said that the  Ajaces  only are vanquish'd and that their Defeat draws Destruction upon all the  Greeks  I don't think that any thing better could be invented to animate couragious Men and make them attempt even Impossibilities  Dacier  IX  VERSE  If yet some heav'nly Pow'r  c  Here  Neptune  considering how the  Greeks  were discourag'd by the Knowledge that  Jupiter  assisted  Hector  insinuates that notwithstanding  Hector  's Confidence in that Assistance yet the Power of some other God might countervail it on their part wherein he alludes to his own aiding them and seems not to doubt his Ability of contesting the Point with  Jove  himself 'Tis with the same Confidence he afterwards speaks to  Iris  of himself and his Power when he refuses to submit to the Order of  Jupiter  in the fifteenth Book  Eustathius  remarks what an Incentive it must be to the  Ajaces  to hear those who could stand against  Hector  equall'd in this oblique manner to the Gods themselves  X  VERSE  Th' inspiring God  Oileus'  active SonPerceiv'd the first    The Reason has been ask'd why the lesser  Ajax  is the first to perceive the Assistance of the God And the ancient Solution of this Question was very ingenious as we have it from  Eustathius  They said that the greater  Ajax  being slow of Apprehension and naturally valiant could not be sensible so soon of this Accession of Strength as the other who immediately perceiv'd it as not owing so much to his natural Courage  XI  VERSE  Short as he turn'd I saw the Pow'r    This Opinion that the Majesty of the Gods was such that they could not be seen Face to Face by Men seems to have been generally receiv'd in most Nations  Spondanus  observes that it might be derived from sacred Truth and founded upon what God says to  Moses  in  Exodus  Ch ℣  Man shall not see me and live Thou shalt see my back Parts but my Face thou shalt not behold  For the farther Particulars of this Notion among the Heathens see the  th  Note on the first and the  th  on the fifth Book  XII  VERSE  The Speech of  Neptune  to the  Greeks  After  Neptune  in his former Discourse to the  Ajaces  who yet maintain'd a retreating Fight had encouraged them to withstand the Attack of the  Trojans  he now addresses himself to those who having fled out of the Battel and retired to the Ships had given up all for lost These he endeavours to bring again to the Engagement by one of the most noble and spirited Speeches in the whole Iliad He represents that their present miserable Condition was not to be imputed to their want of Power but to their want of Resolution to withstand the Enemy whom by Experience they had often found unable  to resist them But what is particularly artful while he is endeavouring to prevail upon them is that he does not attribute their present Dejection of Mind to a cowardly Spirit but to a Resentment and Indignation of their General's Usage of their favourite Hero  Achilles  With the same softning Art he tells them he scorns to speak thus to Cowards but is only concern'd for their Misbehaviour as they are the bravest of the Army He then exhorts them for their own sake to avoid Destruction which would certainly be inevitable if for a Moment longer they delay'd to oppose so imminent a Danger  XIII  VERSE  A Rout undisciplin'd  c  I translate this Line  with Allusion to the want of military Discipline among the  Barbarians  so often hinted at in  Homer  He is always opposing to this the exact and regular Disposition of his  Greeks  and accordingly a few Lines after we are told that the  Grecian  Phalanxes were such that  Mars  or  Minerva  could not have found a Defect in them  XIV  VERSE  Prevent this Evil  c  The Verse in the Original  may be capable of receiving another Sense to this Effect If it be your Resentment of  Agamemnon  's Usage of  Achilles  that withholds you from the Battel  that Evil    viz  the Dissension of those two Chiefs  may soon be remedy'd for the Minds of good Men are easily calm'd and compos'd  I had once translated it  Their future Strife with Speed we shall redress  For noble Minds are soon compos'd to Peace  But upon considering the whole Context more attentively the other Explanation which is that of  Didymus  appeared to me the more natural and unforc'd and I have accordingly follow'd it  XV  VERSE  Fix'd at his Post was each bold  Ajax  found  c  We must here take notice of an old Story which however groundless and idle it seems is related by  Plutarch Philostratus  and others  Ganictor  the Son of  Amphidamas  King of  Euboea  celebrating with all Solemnity the Funeral of his Father proclaimed according to Custom several publick Games among which was the Prize for Poetry  Homer  and  Hesiod  came to dispute for it After they had produc'd several Pieces on either side in all which the Audience declar'd for  Homer Panides  the Brother of the deceased who sate as one of the Judges order'd each of the contending Poets to recite that Part of his Works which he esteem'd the best  Hesiod  repeated those Lines which make the beginning of his second Book    c  Homer  answer'd with the Verses which follow here But the Prince preferring the peaceful Subject of  Hesiod  to the martial one of  Homer  contrary to the Expectation of all adjudg'd the Prize to  Hesiod  The Commentators upon this occasion are very rhetorical and universally exclaim against so crying a Piece of Injustice All the hardest Names which Learning can furnish are very liberally bestow'd upon poor  Panides Spondanus  is mighty smart calls him  Midas  takes him by the Ear and asks the dead Prince as many insulting Questions as any of his Author's Heroes could  have done  Dacier  with all Gravity tells us that Posterty prov'd a more equitable Judge than  Panides  And if I had not told this Tale in my turn I must have incurred the Censure of all the Schoolmasters in the Nation  XVI  VERSE  So close their Order  c  When  Homer  retouches the same Subject he has always the Art to rise in his Ideas above what he said before We shall find an Instance of it in this Place if we compare this manner of commending the exact Discipline of an Army with what he had made use of on the same occasion at the end of the fourth Iliad There it is said that the most experienc'd Warrior could not have reprehended any thing had he been led by  Pallas  thro' the Battel but here he carries it farther in affirming that  Pallas  and the God of War themselves must have admir'd this Disposition of the  Grecian  Forces  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  A chosen Phalanx firm  c  Homer  in these Lines has given us a Description of the Ancient Phalanx which consisted of several Ranks of Men closely ranged in this order The first Line stood with their Spears levell'd directly forward the second Rank being armed with Spears two Cubits longer levell'd them likewise forward thro' the Interstices of the first and the third in the same manner held forth their Spears yet longer thro' the two former Ranks so that the Points of the Spears of the three Ranks terminated in one Line All the other Ranks stood with their Spears erected in Readiness to advance and fill the vacant Places of such as fell This is the Account  Eustathius  gives of the Phalanx which he observes was only fit for a Body of Men acting on the Defensive but improper for the Attack And accordingly  Homer  here only describes the  Greeks  ordering their Battel in this manner when they had no other View but to stand their Ground against the furious Assault of the  Trojans  The same Commentator observes  from  Hermolytus  an ancient Writer of  Tacticks  that this manner of ordering the Phalanx was afterwards introduc'd among the  Spartans  by  Lycurgus  among the  Argives  by  Lysander  among the  Thebans  by  Epaminondas  and among the  Macedonians  by  Charidemus  XVIII  VERSE  As from some Mountain's craggy Forehead torn  c  This is one of the noblest Simile's in all  Homer  and the most justly corresponding in its Circumstances to the thing described The furious Descent of  Hector  from the Wall represented by a Stone that flies from the top of a Rock the Hero push'd on by the superior Force of  Jupiter  as the Stone driven by a Torrent the Ruins of the Wall falling after him all things yielding before him the Clamour and Tumult around him all imag'd in the violent bounding and leaping of the Stone the crackling of the Woods the Shock the Noise the Rapidity the Irresistibility and the Augmentation of Force in its Progress All these Points of Likeness make but the first Part of this admirable Simile Then the sudden Stop of the Stone when it comes to the Plain as of  Hector  at the Phalanx of the  Ajaces  alluding also to the natural Situation of the Ground  Hector  rushing down the Declivity of the Shore and being stopp'd on the Level of the Sea And lastly the Immobility of both when so stopp'd the Enemy being as unable to move him back as he to get forward This last Branch of the Comparison is the happiest in the World and tho' not hitherto observ'd is what methinks makes the principal Beauty and Force of it The Simile is copied by  Virgil Aen    Ac veluti montis saxum de vertice praeceps  Cum ruit avulsum vento seu turbidus imber  Proluit aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas  Fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu  Exultatque solo sylvas armenta virosque  Involvens secum Disjecta per agmina Turnus  Sic urbis ruit ad muros  And  Tasso  has again copied it from  Virgil  in his  th  Book  Qual gran sasso tal hor che o la vecchiezza  Solve da un monte o svelle ira de 'venti  Ruinoso dirupa e porta e spezza  Le selve e con le case anco gli armenti  Tal giù trahea de la sublime altezza  L'horribil trave e merli e arme e gente  Diè la torre a quel moto uno o duo crolli  Tremar le mura e rimbombaro i colli  It is but Justice to  Homer  to take notice how infinitely inferior both these Similes are to their Original They have taken the Image without the Likeness and lost those corresponding Circumstances which raise the Justness and Sublimity of  Homer  's In  Virgil  it is only the Violence of  Turnus  in which the whole Application consists And in  Tasso  it has no farther Allusion than to the Fall of a Tower in general  There is yet another Beauty in the Numbers of this Part As the Verses themselves make us see the Sound of them makes us hear what they represent in the noble Roughness Rapidity and sonorous Cadence that distinguishes them    c  The Translation however short it falls of these Beauties may yet serve to shew the Reader that there was at least an Endeavour to imitate them  XIX  VERSE Idomen  of  Crete  Idomeneus  appears at large in this Book whose Character if I take it right is such as we see pretty often in common Life A Person of the first Rank sufficient enough of his high Birth growing into Years conscious of his Decline in Strength and active Qualities and therefore endeavouring to make it up to himself in Dignity and to preserve the Veneration of others The true Picture of a stiff old Soldier not willing to lose any of the Reputation  he has acquir'd yet not inconsiderate in Danger but by the Sense of his Age and by his Experience in Battel become too cautious to engage with any great odds against him Very careful and tender of his Soldiers whom he had commanded so long that they were become old Acquaintance so that it was with great Judgment  Homer  chose to introduce him here in performing a kind Office to one of 'em who was wounded Talkative upon Subjects of War as afraid that others might lose the Memory of what he had done in better Days of which the long Conversation with  Meriones  and  Ajax  's Reproach to him in Iliad ℣ are sufficient Proofs One may observe some Strokes of Lordliness and State in his Character That Respect  Agamemnon  seems careful to treat him with and the particular Distinctions shewn him at Table are mention'd in a manner that insinuates they were Points upon which this Prince not a little insisted  Il  ℣  c  The vaunting of his Family in this Book together with his Sarcasms and contemptuous Railleries on his dead Enemies savour of the same Turn of Mind And it seems there was among the Ancients a Tradition of  Idomeneus  which strengthens this Conjecture of his Pride For we find in the  Heroicks  of  Philostratus  that before he would come to the  Trojan  War he demanded a Share in the sovereign Command with  Agamemnon  himself  I must upon this occasion make an Observation once for all which will be applicable to many Passages in  Homer  and afford a Solution of many Difficulties It is that our Author drew several of his Characters with an Eye to the Histories then known of famous Persons or the Traditions that past in those Times One cannot believe otherwise of a Poet who appears so nicely exact in observing all the Customs of the Age he described nor can we imagine the infinite Number of minute Circumstances relating to particular Persons which we meet with every where in his Poem could possibly have been invented purely as Ornaments to it This Reflection will account for a hundred seeming Oddnesses not only in the  Characters  but in the  Speeches  of the Iliad For as no Author is more true than  Homer  to the Character of the Person he introduces speaking so no one more often suits his  Oratory to the Character of the Person spoken to Many of these Beauties must needs be lost to us yet this Supposition will give a new Light to several Particulars For instance the Speech I have been mentioning of  Agamemnon  to  Idomeneus  in the  th  Book wherein he puts this Hero in mind of the magnificent Entertainments he had given him becomes in this View much less odd and surprizing Or who can tell but it had some Allusion to the Manners of the  Cretans  whom he commanded whose Character was so well known as to become a Proverb  The  Cretans  evil Beasts and slow Bellies  XX  VERSE  The Surgeons of the Camp    Podalirius  and  Machaon  were not the only Physicians in the Army it appears from some Passages in this Poem that each Body of Troops had one peculiar to themselves It may not be improper to advertise that the ancient Physicians were all Surgeons  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE Meriones  attends Whom thus he questions    This Conversation between  Idomeneus  and  Meriones  is generally censured as highly improper and out of Place and as such is given up even by M  Dacier  the most zealons of our Poet's Defenders However if we look closely into the Occasion and Drift of this Discourse the Accusation will I believe appear not so well grounded Two Persons of Distinction just when the Enemy is put to a stop by the  Ajaces  meet behind the Army Having each on important occasions retired out of the Fight the one to help a wounded Soldier the other to seek a new Weapon  Idomeneus  who is superior in Years as well as Authority returning to the Battel is surprized to meet  Meriones  out of it who was one of his own Officers  as  Homer  here calls him and being jealous of his Soldier's Honour demands the Cause of his quitting the Fight  Meriones  having told him it was the want  of a Spear he yet seems unsatisfy'd with the Excuse adding that he himself did not approve of that distant manner of fighting with a Spear  Meriones  being touch'd to the quick with this Reproach replies that He of all the  Greeks  had the least reason to suspect his Courage Whereupon  Idomeneus  perceiving him highly piqued assures him he entertains no such hard Thoughts of him since he had often known his Courage prov'd on such Occasions where the Danger being greater and the Number smaller it was impossible for a Coward to conceal his natural Infirmity But now recollecting that a malicious Mind might give a sinister Interpretation to their Inactivity during this Discourse he immediately breaks it off upon that Reflection As therefore this Conversation has its Rise from a Jealousy in the most tender Point of Honour I think the Poet cannot justly be blamed for suffering a Discourse so full of warm Sentiments to run on for about forty Verses which after all cannot be suppos'd to take up more than two or three Minutes from Action  XXII  VERSE  This headless Lance  c  We have often seen several of  Homer  's Combatants lose and break their Spears yet they do not therefore retire from the Battel to seek other Weapons why therefore does  Homer  here send  Meriones  on this Errand It may be said that in the kind of Fight which the  Greeks  now maintain'd drawn up into the Phalanx  Meriones  was useless without this Weapon  XXIII  VERSE  Spears I have store  c  Idomeneus  describes his Tent as a Magazine stored with Variety of Arms won from the Enemy which were not only laid up as useless Trophies of his Victories but kept there in order to supply his own and his Friends Occasions And this Consideration shews us one reason why these Warriors contended with such Eagerness to carry off the Arms of a vanquish'd Enemy  This gives me an occasion to animadvert upon a false Remark of  Eustathius  which is inserted in the  th  Note on the  th  Book  "that  Homer  to shew us nothing is so unseasonable in a Battel as to stay to despoil the slain feigns that most of the Warriors who do it are kill'd wounded or unsuccessful"  I am astonish'd how so great a Mistake should fall from any Man who had read  Homer  much more from one who had read him so thoroughly and even superstitiously as the old Archbishop of  Thessalonica  There is scarce a Book in  Homer  that does not abound with Instances to the contrary where the Conquerors strip their Enemies and bear off their Spoils in Triumph It was as I have already said in the Essay on  Homer  's Battels as honourable an Exploit in those Days to carry off the Arms as it is now to gain a Standard But it is a strange Consequence that because our Author sometimes represents a Man unsuccessful in a glorious Attempt he therefore discommends the Attempt itself and is as good an Argument against encountring an Enemy living as against spoiling him dead One ought not to confound this with Plundering between which  Homer  has so well mark'd the Distinction when he constantly speaks of the Spoils as glorious but makes  Nestor  in the  th  Book and  Hector  in the  th  directly forbid the Pillage as a Practice that has often prov'd fatal in the midst of a Victory and sometimes even after it  XXIV  VERSE  To him  Idomeneus  There is a great deal more Dialogue in  Homer  than in  Virgil  The  Roman  Poet's are generally set Speeches those of the  Greek  more in Conversation What  Virgil  does by two Words of a Narration  Homer  brings about by a Speech he hardly raises one of his Heroes out of Bed without some Talk concerning it There are not only Replies but Rejoinders in  Homer  a thing scarce ever to be found in  Virgil  the Consequence whereof is that there must be in the Iliad many continued Conversations such as this of our two Heroes a little resembling common Chitchat This renders the Poem more natural and  animated but less grave and majestick However that such was the way of writing generally practis'd in those ancient Times appears from the like manner used in most of the Books of the Old Testament and it particularly agreed with our Author's warm Imagination which delighted in perpetual Imagery and in painting every Circumstance of what he described  XXV  VERSE  In that sharp Service  c  In a general Battel Cowardise may be the more easily conceal'd by reason of the Number of the Combatants but in an Ambuscade where the Soldiers are few each must be discover'd to be what he is this is the reason why the Ancients entertain'd so great an Idea of this sort of War the bravest Men were always chosen to serve upon such Occasions  Eustathius  XXVI  VERSE  So  Mars  Armipotent  c  Homer  varies his Similitudes with all imaginable Art sometimes deriving them from the Properties of Animals sometimes from natural Passions sometimes from the Occurrences of Life and sometimes as in the Simile before us from History The Invention of  Mars  's Passage from  Thrace  which was feign'd to be the Country of that God to the  Phlegyans  and  Ephyrians  is a very beautiful and poetical manner of celebrating the martial Genius of that People who liv'd in perpetual Wars  Methinks there is something of a fine Enthusiasm in  Homer  's manner of fetching a Compass as it were to draw in new Images besides those in which the direct Point of Likeness consists  Milton  perfectly well understood the Beauty of these digressive Images as we may see from the following Simile which is in a manner made up of them  Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks  In  Vallombrosa  where th'  Etrurian  Shades  Highoverarch'd embow'r Or scatter'd Sedge  Afloat when with fierce Winds  Orion  arm'd  Hath vex'd the  Red Sea  Coast whose Wave o'erthrew  Busiris  and his  Memphian  Chivalry  While with perfidious Hatred they pursu'd  The Sojourners of  Goshen  who beheld  From the safe Shore their floating Carcasses  And broken ChariotWheelsSo thick bestrown  Abject and lost lay these  As for the general Purport of this Comparison of  Homer  it gives us a noble and majestick Idea at once of  Idomeneus  and  Meriones  represented by  Mars  and his Son  Terror  in which each of these Heroes is greatly elevated yet the just Distinction between them preserved The beautiful Simile of  Virgil  in his  th Aeneid  is drawn with an Eye to this of our Author  Qualis apud gelidi cùm flumina concitus Hebri  Sanguineus Mavors clypeo increpat atque furentes  Bella movens immittit equos illi aequore aperto  Ante Notos Zephyrumque volant gemit ultima pulsu  Thraca pedum circumque atrae Formidinis ora  Iraeque Insidiaeque Dei comitatus aguntur  XXVII  VERSE  Shall we join the Right  Or combate in the Centre of the Fight  Or to the Left our wanted Succour lend    The common Interpreters have to this Question of  Meriones  given a meaning which is highly impertinent if not downright Nonsense explaining it thus  Shall we fight on the right or in the middle or on the left for no where else doe the  Greeks  so much want Assistance  which amounts to this  Shall we engage where our Assistance is most wanted or where it is not wanted The Context as well as the Words of the Original oblige us to understand it in this obvious meaning  Shall we bring our Assistance to the right to the left or to the Centre Since the  Greeks  being equally press'd and engag'd on all sides equally need our Aid in all Parts  XXVIII  VERSE  Not in the Centre  c  There is in this Answer of  Idomeneus  a small Circumstance which is overlook'd by the Commentators but in which the whole Spirit and Reason of what is said by him consists He says he is in no fear for the Centre since it is defended by  Teucer  and  Ajax Teucer  being not only most famous for the Use of the Bow but likewise excellent  in a  close standing Fight  And as for  Ajax  tho' not so swift of Foot as  Achilles  yet he was equal to him  in the same stedfast manner of fighting hereby plainly intimating that he was secure for the Centre because that Post was defended by two Persons both accomplish'd in that Part of War which was most necessary for the Service they were then engaged in the two Expressions before mention'd peculiarly signifying a firm and steady way of fighting most useful in maintaining a Post  XXIX  VERSE  In War and Discord's Adamantine Chain    This short but comprehensive Allegory is very proper to give us an Idea of the present Condition of the two contending Armies who being both powerfully sustain'd by the Assistance of superior Deities join and mix together in a close and bloody Engagement without any remarkable Advantage on either side To image to us this State of Things the Poet represents  Jupiter  and  Neptune  holding the two Armies close bound by a mighty Chain which he calls the Knot of Contention and War and of which the two Gods draw the Extremities  whereby the enclos'd Armies are compell'd together without any Possibility on either side to separate or to conquer there is not perhaps in  Homer  any Image at once so exact and so bold Madam  Dacier  acknowledges that despairing to make this Passage shine in her Language she purposely omitted it in her Translation But from what she says in her Annotations it seems that she did not rightly apprehend the Propriety and Beauty of it  Hobbes  too was not very sensible of it when he translated it so oddly  And thus the Saw from Brother unto Brother  Of cruel War was drawn alternately  And many slain on one side and the other  XXX  VERSE It will be necessary for the better understanding the Conduct of  Homer  in every Battel he describes to reflect on the particular kind of Fight and the Circumstances that distinguish each In this View therefore we ought to remember thro' this whole Book that the Battel describ'd in it is a fix'd close Fight wherein the Armies engage in a gross compact Body without any of those Skirmishes or Feats of Activity so often mention'd in the foregoing Engagements We see at the beginning of it the  Grecians  form a Phalanx ℣ which continues unbroken at the very end ℣ The chief Weapon made use of is a Spear being most proper for this manner of Combat nor do we see any other use of a Chariot but to carry off the dead or wounded as in the Instance of  Harpalion  and  Deiphobus    From hence we may observe with what Judgment and Propriety  Homer  introduces  Idomeneus  as the chief in Action on this occasion For this Hero being declined from his Prime and somewhat stiff with Years was only fit for this kind of Engagement as  Homer  expressly says in the th Verse of the present Book  XXXI  VERSE  The great  Idomeneus  bestrides the dead  And thus he cries    It seems says  Eustathius  on this Place that the Iliad being an heroick Poem is of too serious a Nature to admit of Raillery Yet  Homer  has found the secret of joining two things that are in a manner incompatible For this Piece of Raillery is so far from raising Laughter that it becomes a Hero and is capable to enflame the Courage of all who hear it It also elevates the Character of  Idomeneus  who notwithstanding he is in the midst of imminent Dangers preserves his usual Gaiety of Temper which is the greatest Evidence of an uncommon Courage  Id p    I confess I am of an Opinion very different from this of  Eustathius  which is also adopted by M  Dacier  So severe and bloody an Irony to a dying Person is a fault in Morals if not in Poetry itself It should not have place at all or if it should is ill placed here  Idomeneus  is represented a brave Man nay a Man of a compassionate Nature in the Circumstance he was introduc'd in of assisting a wounded Soldier What Provocation could such an one have to insult so barbarously an unfortunate Prince being neither his Rival nor particular Enemy True Courage is inseparable from Humanity and all generous Warriors regret the very Victories they gain when they reflect what a Price of Blood they cost I know it may be answer'd that these were not the Manners of  Homer  's Time a Spirit of Violence and Devastation then reigned even among the chosen People of God as may be seen from the Actions of  Joshua c  However if one would forgive the  Cruelty  one cannot forgive the  Gaiety  on such an occasion These inhuman Jests the Poet was so far from being oblig'd to make that he was on the contrary forced to break through the general serious Air of his Poem  to introduce them Would it not raise a Suspicion that whatever we see of his superior Genius in other respects his own Views of Morality were not elevated above the Barbarity of his Age I think indeed the thing by far the most shocking in this Author is that Spirit of Cruelty which appears too manifestly in the Iliad  Virgil  was too judicious to imitate  Homer  in these Licences and is much more reserv'd in his Sarcasms and Insults There are not above four or five in the whole  Aeneid  That of  Pyrrhus  to  Priam  in the second Book tho' barbarous in itself may be accounted for as intended to raise a Character of Horror and render the Action of  Pyrrhus  odious whereas  Homer  stains his most Favourite Characters with these Barbarities That of  Ascanius  over  Numanus  in the ninth was a fair Opportunity where  Virgil  might have indulg'd the Humour of a cruel Raillery and have been excus'd by the Youth and Gaiety of the Speaker yet it is no more than a very moderate Answer to the Insolences with which he had just been provok'd by his Enemy only retorting two of his own Words upon him  I verbis virtutem illude superbis  Bis capti Phryges haec Rutulis responsa remittunt  He never suffers his  Aeneas  to fall into this Practice but while he is on fire with Indignation after the Death of his Friend  Pallas  That short one to  Mezentius  is the least that could be said to such a Tyrant  Ubi nunc Mezentius acer illa  Effera vis animi  The worstnatur'd one I remember which yet is more excusable than  Homer  's is that of  Turnus  to  Eumedes  in the  th  Book  En agros quam bello Trojane petisti  Hesperiam metire jacens haec praemia qui me  Ferro ausi tentare ferunt sic moenia condunt  XXXII  VERSE  And such the Contract of the  Phrygian  King  c  It was but natural to raise a Question on occasion of these and other Passages in  Homer  how it comes to pass that the Heroes of different Nations are so well acquainted with the Stories and Circumstances of each other  Eustathius  's Solution is no ill one that the Warriors on both sides might learn the Story of their Enemies from the Captives they took during the Course of so long a War  XXXIII  VERSE  The  Cretan  saw and stooping  c  Nothing could paint in a more lively manner this whole Action and every Circumstance of it than the following Lines There is the Posture of  Idomeneus  upon seeing the Lance flying toward him the lifting the Shield obliquely to turn it aside the Arm discover'd in that Position the Form Composition Materials and Ornaments of the Shield distinctly specify'd the Flight of the Dart over it the Sound of it first as it flew then as it fell and the Decay of that Sound on the Edge of the Buckler which being thinner than the other Parts rather tinkled than rung especially when the first Force of the Stroke was spent on the Orb of it All this in the Compass of so few Lines in which every word is an Image is something more beautifully particular than I remember to have met with in any Poet  XXXIV  VERSE  He once of  Ilion  's Youth the loveliest Boy    Some Manuscripts after these Words  insert the three following Verses  which I have not translated as not thinking them genuine Mr  Barnes  is of the same Opinion  XXXV  VERSE  His lab'ring Heart heaves with so strong a bound  The long Lance shakes and vibrates in the Wound    We cannot read  Homer  without observing a wonderful Variety in the Wounds and Manner of dying Some of these Wounds are painted with very singular Circumstances and those of uncommon Art and Beauty This Passage is a Masterpiece in that way  Alcathous  is pierced into the Heart which throbs with so strong a Pulse that the Motion is communicated even to the distant End of the Spear which is vibrated thereby This Circumstance might appear too bold and the Effect beyond Nature were we not inform'd by the most skilful Anatomists of the wonderful Force of this Muscle which some of them have computed to be equal to the Weight of several thousand Pounds  Lower de Corde Borellus  XXXVI  VERSE  Incens'd at partial  Priam c  Homer  here gives the reason why  Aeneas  did not fight in the foremost Ranks It was against his Inclination that he serv'd  Priam  and he was rather engag'd by Honour and Reputation to assist his Country than by any Disposition to aid that Prince This Passage is purely historical and the Ancients have preserv'd to us a Tradition which serves to explain it They say that  Aeneas  became suspected by  Priam  on account of an Oracle which prophesied he should in Process of Time rule over the  Trojans  The King therefore shew'd him no great Degree of Esteem or Consideration with Design to discredit and render him despicable to the People  Eustathius  This Envy of  Priam  and this Report of the Oracle are mention'd by  Achilles  to  Aeneas  in the  th  Book ℣      And  Neptune  in the th Verse of the same Book  I shall conclude this Note with the Character of  Aeneas  as it is drawn by  Philostratus  wherein he makes mention of the same Tradition  "  Aeneas  says this Author was inferior to  Hector  in Battel only in all else equal and in Prudence superior He was likewise skilful in whatever related to the Gods and conscious of what Destiny had reserv'd for him after the taking of  Troy  Incapable of Fear never discompos'd and particularly possessing himself in the Article of Danger  Hector  is reported to have been call'd the Hand and  Aeneas  the Head of the  Trojans  and the latter more advantag'd their Affairs by his Caution than the former by his Fury These two Heroes were much of the same Age and the same Stature The Air of  Aeneas  had something in it less bold and forward but at the same time more fix'd and constant  Philostrat Heroic  XXXVII  VERSE  Like  Ida  's Flocks  c  Homer  whether he treats of the Customs of Men or Beasts is always a faithful Interpreter of Nature When Sheep leave the Pasture and drink freely it is a certain Sign that they have found good Pasturage and that they are all sound 'tis therefore upon this Account that  Homer  says the Shepherd rejoices  Homer  we find well understood what  Aristotle  many Ages after him remark'd  viz  that Sheep grow fat by drinking This therefore is the reason why Shepherds are accustom'd to give their Flocks a certain Quantity of Salt every five Days  in the Summer that they may by this means drink the more abundantly  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  And fir'd with Hate    Homer  does not tell us the occasion of this Hatred but since his Days  Simonides  and  Ibycus  write that  Idomeneus  and  Deiphobus  were Rivals and both in love with  Helen  This very well agrees with the ancient Tradition which  Eurypides  and  Virgil  have follow'd For after the Death of  Paris  they tell us she was espous'd to  Deiphobus Eustathius  XXXIX  VERSE  Bending he fell and doubled to the Ground Lay panting    The Original is      The Versification represents the short broken Pantings of the dying Warrior in the short sudden Break at the second Syllable of the second Line And this beauty is as it happens precisely copied in the  English  It is not often that a Translator can do this Justice to  Homer  but he must be content to imitate these Graces and Proprieties at more distance by endeavouring at something parallel tho' not the same  XL  VERSE  King  Helenus  The Appellation of King was not anciently confin'd to those only who bore the sovereign Dignity but apply'd also to others There was in the Island of  Cyprus  a whole Order of Officers call'd Kings whose Business it was to receive the Relations of Informers concerning all that happen'd in the Island and to regulate Affairs accordingly  Eustathius  XLI  VERSE  As on some ample Barn's wellharden'd Floor    We ought not to be shock'd at the Frequency of these Similes taken from the Ideas of a rural Life In early Times before Politeness had rais'd the Esteem of Arts subservient to Luxury above those necessary to the Subsistence of Mankind Agriculture was the Employment of Persons of the greatest Esteem and Distinction We see in sacred History Princes busy at Sheepshearing and in the middle Times of the  Roman  Commonwealth a Dictator taken from the Plough Wherefore it ought not to be wonder'd that Allusions and Comparisons of this kind are frequently used by ancient heroick Writers as well to raise as illustrate their Descriptions But since these Arts are fallen from their ancient Dignity and become the Drudgery of the lowest People the Images of them are likewise sunk into Meanness and without this Consideration must appear to common Readers unworthy to have place in Epic Poems It was perhaps thro' too much Deference to such Tastes that  Chapman  omitted this Simile in his Translation  XLII  VERSE  A Sling's soft Wool snatch'd from a Soldier's side  At once the Tent and Ligature supply'd    The Words of the Original are these  This Passage by the Commentators ancient and modern seems rightly understood in the Sense express'd in this Translation The word  properly signifying a  Sling  which as  Eustathius  observes from an old Scholiast was anciently made of woollen Strings  Chapman  alone dissents from the common Interpretation boldly pronouncing that Slings are no where mention'd in the Iliad without giving any reason  for his Opinion He therefore translates the word  a  Skarffe  by no other Authority but that he says  it was a fitter thing to hang a wounded Arm in than a Sling  and very prettily wheedles his Reader into this Opinion by a most gallant Imagination that  his Squire might carry this Skarffe about him as a Favour of his own or of his Master's Mistress  But for the use he has found for this Skarffe there is not any Pretence from the Original where it is only said the Wound was bound up without any mention of hanging the Arm After all he is hard put to it in his Translation for being resolv'd to have a  Scarf  and oblig'd to mention  Wool  we are left entirely at a loss to know from whence he got the latter  A like Passage recurs near the end of this Book where the Poet says the  Locrians  went to War without Shield or Spear only armed  Which last Expression as all the Commentators agree signifies a  Sling  tho' the word  is not used  Chapman  here likewise without any Colour of Authority dissents from the common Opinion but very inconstant in his Errors varies his Mistake and assures us  this Expression is the true Periphrasis of a light kind of Armour call'd a  Jack  by which all our Archers used to serve in of old and which were ever quilted with Wool  XLIII  VERSE  The cover'd PoleAxe    Homer  never ascribes this Weapon to any but the  Barbarians  for the BattelAxe was not used in War by the politer Nations It was the favourite Weapon of the  Amazons Eustathius  XLIV  VERSE  The Speech of  Menelaus  This Speech of  Menelaus  over his dying Enemy is very different from those  with which  Homer  frequently makes his Heroes insult the vanquish'd and answers very well the Character of this goodnatur'd Prince Here are no insulting Taunts no cruel Sarcasms nor any sporting with the particular Misfortunes of the dead The Invectives he makes are general arising naturally from a Remembrance of his Wrongs and being almost nothing else but a Recapitulation of them These Reproaches come most justly from this Prince as being the only Person among the  Greeks  who had receiv'd any personal Injury from the  Trojans  The Apostrophe he makes to  Jupiter  wherein he complains of his protecting a wicked People has given occasion to censure  Homer  as guilty of Impiety in making his Heroes tax the Gods with Injustice But since in the former Part of this Speech it is expresly said that  Jupiter  will certainly punish the  Trojans  by the Destruction of their City for violating the Laws of Hospitality the latter Part ought only to be consider'd as a Complaint to  Jupiter  for delaying that Vengeance This Reflection being no more than what a pious suffering Mind griev'd at the flourishing Condition of prosperous Wickedness might naturally fall into Not unlike this is the Complaint of the Prophet  Jeremiah  Ch ℣  Righteous art thou O Lord when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously  Nothing can more fully represent the Cruelty and Injustice of the  Trojans  than the Observation with which  Menelaus  finishes their Character by saying that they have a more strong constant and insatiable Appetite after Bloodshed and Rapine than others have to satisfy the most agreeable Pleasures and natural Desires  XLV  VERSE  The best of things beyond their Measure cloy    These Words comprehend a very natural Sentiment which perfectly shews the wonderful Folly of Men They are soon weary'd with the most agreeable things when they are innocent  but never with the most toilsome things in the World when injust and criminal  Eustathius Dacier  XLVI  VERSE  The Dance    In the Original it is call'd    the blameless Dance  to distinguish says  Eustathius  what sort of Dancing it is that  Homer  commends For there were two kinds of Dancing practis'd among the Ancients the one reputable invented by  Minerva  or by  Castor  and  Pollux  the other dishonest of which  Pan  or  Bacchus  was the Author They were distinguish'd by the Name of the Tragic and the Comic or Satyric Dance But those which probably our Author commends were certain military Dances us'd by the greatest Heroes One of this sort was known to the  Macedonians  and  Persians  practis'd by  Antiochus  the Great and the famous  Polyperchon  There was another which was danc'd in compleat Armour call'd the  Pyrrhick  from  Pyrrhicus  the  Spartan  its Inventor which continu'd in fashion among the  Lacedaemonians Scaliger  the Father remarks that this Dance was too laborious to remain long in use even among the Ancients however it seems that Labour could not discourage this bold Critick from reviving that laudable kind of Dance in the Presence of the Emperor  Maximilian  and his whole Court It is not to be doubted but the Performance rais'd their Admiration nor much to be wonder'd at if they desir'd to see more than once so extraordinary a Spectacle as we have it in his own Words  Poëtices lib    cap    Hanc saltationem  Pyrrhicam  nos  saepe    diu  coram Divo Maximiliano jussu Bonisacii patrui  non sine stupore totius Germaniae  repraesentavimus  XLVII  VERSE  Like some vile Worm extended on the Ground    I cannot be of  Eustathius  's Opinion that this Simile was design'd to debase the Character of  Harpalion  and to represent him in a mean and disgraceful View as one who had nothing noble in him I rather think from the Character he gives  of this young Man whose Piety carry'd him to the Wars to attend his Father and from the Air of this whole Passage which is tender and pathetick that he intended this humble Comparison only as a mortifying Picture of human Misery and Mortality As to the Verses which  Eustathius  alledges for a Proof of the Cowardice of  Harpalion    The Retreat described in the first Verse is common to the greatest Heroes in  Homer  the same Words are apply'd to  Deiphobus  and  Meriones  in this Book and to  Patroclus  in the  th  ℣ The same thing in other Words is said even of the great  Ajax Il  ℣ And we have  Ulysses  describ'd in the  th  ℣ with the same Circumspection and Fear of the Darts tho' none of those Warriors have the same reason as  Harpalion  for their Retreat or Caution he alone being unarm'd which Circumstance takes away all Imputation of Cowardice  XLVIII  VERSE  The pensive Father    We have seen in the  th  Iliad the Death of  Pylaemenes  General of the  Paphlagonians  How comes he then in this Place to be introduced as following the Funeral of his Son  Eustathius  informs us of a most ridiculous Solution of some Criticks who thought it might be the Ghost of this unhappy Father who not being yet interr'd according to the Opinion of the Ancients wander'd upon the Earth  Zenodotus  not satisfy'd with this as indeed he had little reason to be chang'd the Name of  Pylaemenes  into  Kylaemenes Didymus  thinks there were two of the same Name as there are in  Homer  two  Schedius  's two  Eurymedon  's and three  Adrastus  's And others correct the Verse by adding a Negative    his Father did  not  follow his Chariot with his Face bath'd in Tears  Which last if not of more Weight than the rest is yet more ingenious  Eustathius Dacier  Nor did his valiant Father now no more  Pursue the mournful Pomp along the Shore  No Sire surviv'd to grace th' untimely Bier  Or sprinkle the cold Ashes with a Tear  XLIX  VERSE  And chose the certain glorious Path to Death    Thus we see  Euchenor  is like  Achilles  who sail'd to  Troy  tho' he knew he should fall before it This might somewhat have prejudic'd the Character of  Achilles  every Branch of which ought to be single and superior to all others as he ought to be without a Rival in every thing that speaks a Hero Therefore we find two essential Differences between  Euchenor  and  Achilles  which preserve the Superiority of the Hero of the Poem  Achilles  if he had not sail'd to  Troy  had enjoy'd a long Life but  Euchenor  had been soon cut off by some cruel Disease  Achilles  being independent and as a King could have liv'd at ease at home without being obnoxious to any Disgrace but  Euchenor  being but a private Man must either have gone to the War or been expos'd to an ignominious Penalty  Eustathius Dacier  L  VERSE  Nor knew great Hector  c  Most part of this Book being employ'd to describe the brave Resistance the  Greeks  made on their left under  Idomeneus  and  Meriones  the Poet now shifts the Scene and returns to  Hector  whom he left in the Centre of the Army after he had pass'd the Wall endeavouring in vain to break the Phalanx where  Ajax  commanded And that the Reader might take notice of this Change of Place and carry distinctly in his Mind each Scene of Action  Homer  is very careful in the following Lines to let us know that  Hector  still continues in the Place where he had first pass'd the Wall at that part of it which was lowest as appears from  Sarpedon  's having pull'd down one of its Battlements on foot  lib  and which was nearest  the Station where the Ships of  Ajax  were lay'd because that Hero was probably thought a sufficient Guard for that Part As the Poet is so very exact in describing each Scene as in a Chart or Plan the Reader ought to be careful to trace each Action in it otherwise he will see nothing but Confusion in things which are in themselves very regular and distinct This Observation is the more necessary because even in this Place where the Poet intended to prevent any such Mistake  Dacier  and other Interpreters have apply'd to the present Action what is only a Recapitulation of the Time and Place describ'd in the former Book  LI  VERSE Pthians  These  Pthians  are not the Troops of  Achilles  for those were call'd  Pthiotes  but they were the Troops of  Protesilaus  and  Philoctetes Eustathius  LII  VERSE  So when two lordly Bulls  c  The Image here given of the  Ajaces  is very lively and exact there being no Circumstance of their present Condition that is not to be found in the Comparison and no Particular in the Comparison that does not resemble the Action of the Heroes Their Strength and Labour their Unanimity and Nearness to each other the Difficulties they struggle against and the Sweat occasion'd by this Struggling perfectly corresponding with the Simile  LIII  VERSE  Achilles  great  Achilles  yet remains  On yonder Decks and yet o'erlooks the Plains    There never was a nobler Encomium than this of  Achilles  It seems enough to so wise a Counsellor as  Polydamas  to convince so intrepid a Warrior as  Hector  in how great Danger the  Trojans  stood to say Achilles  sees us  "Tho' he abstains from the Fight he still casts his Eye on the Battel it  is true we are a brave Army and yet keep our Ground but still  Achilles  sees us and we are not safe"  This Reflection makes him a God a single Regard of whom can turn the Fate of Armies and determine the Destiny of a whole People And how nobly is this Thought extended in the Progress of the Poem where we shall see in the  th  Book the  Trojans  fly at the first Sight of his Armour worn by  Patroclus  and in the  th  their Defeat compleated by his sole Appearance unarm'd on his Ship  LIV  VERSE Hector  with a bound Leapt from his Chariot    Hector  having in the last Book alighted and caused the  Trojans  to leave their Chariots behind them when they pass'd the Trench and no mention of any Chariot but that of  Asius  since occurring in the Battel we must necessarily infer either that  Homer  has neglected to mention the Advance of the Chariots a Circumstance which should not have been omitted or else that he is guilty here of a great Mistake in making  Hector  leap from his Chariot I think it evident that this is really a Slip of the Poet's Memory For in this very Book ℣ we see  Polites  leads off his wounded Brother to the Place where his Chariot remain'd behind the Army And again in the next Book  Hector  being wounded is carried out of the Battel in his Soldier's Arms to the Place where his Horses and Chariot waited at a distance from the Battel      Lib  ℣  But what puts it beyond Dispute that the Chariots continued all this time in the Place where they first quitted them is a Passage in the beginning of the fifteenth Book where the  Trojans  being overpower'd by the  Greeks  fly back over the Wall and  Trench till they came to the Place where their Chariots stood  Lib  ℣  Neither  Eustathius  nor  Dacier  have taken any notice of this Incongruity which would tempt one to believe they were willing to overlook what they could not excuse I must honestly own my Opinion that there are several other Negligences of this kind in  Homer  I cannot think otherwise of the Passage in the present Book concerning  Pylaemenes  notwithstanding the Excuses of the Commentators which are there given The very using the same Name in different Places for different Persons confounds the Reader in the Story and is what certainly would be better avoided So that 'tis to no purpose to say there might as well be two  Pylaemenes  's as two  Schedius  's two  Eurymedons  two  Ophelestes  's c since it is more blameable to be negligent in many Instances than in one  Virgil  is not free from this as  Macrobius  has observ'd  Sat l    c  But the abovemention'd Names are Proofs of that Critick's being greatly mistaken in affirming that  Homer  is not guilty of the same It is one of those many Errors he was led into by his Partiality to  Homer  above  Virgil  LV  VERSE  And seem'd a moving Mountain topt with Snow    This Simile is very short in the Original and requires to be open'd a little to discover its full Beauty I am not of Mad  Dacier  's Opinion that the Lustre of  Hector  's Armour was that which furnish'd  Homer  with this Image it seems rather to allude to the Plume upon his Helmet in the Action of shaking which this Hero is so frequently painted by our Author and from thence distinguish'd by the remarkable Epithet  This is a very pleasing Image and very much what the Painters call  Picturesque  I fancy it gave the Hint for a very fine one in  Spenser  where he represents the  Person of  Contemplation  in the Figure of a venerable old Man almost consum'd with Study  His snowy Locks adown his Shoulders spread  As hoary Frost with Spangles doth attire  The mossy Branches of an Oak half dead  LVI  VERSE  Illfated  Paris  The Reproaches which  Hector  here casts on  Paris  give us the Character of this Hero who in many things resembles  Achilles  being like him injust violent and impetuous and making no Distinction between the innocent and criminal 'Tis he who is obstinate in attacking the Entrenchments yet asks an Account of those who were slain in the Attack from  Paris  and tho' he ought to blame himself for their Deaths yet he speaks to  Paris  as if thro' his Cowardice he had suffer'd these to be slain whom he might have preserv'd if he had fought couragiously  Eustathius  LVII  VERSE  Widerowling foaming high and tumbling to the Shore    I have endeavour'd in this Verse to imitate the Confusion and broken Sound of the Original which images the Tumult and roaring of many Waters    LVIII  VERSE  Clouds of rolling Dust    A Critick might take occasion from hence to speak of the exact time of the Year in which the Actions of the Iliad are suppos'd to have happen'd And according to the grave manner of a learned Dissertator begin by informing us that he has found it must be the SummerSeason from the frequent mention made of Clouds of Dust Tho what he discovers might be  full as well inferr'd from common Sense the Summer being the natural Season for a Campaign However he should quote all those Passages at large and adding to the Article of  Dust  as much as he can find of the  Sweat  of the Heroes it might fill three Pages very much to his own Satisfaction It would look well to observe farther that the Fields are describ'd flowery  Il  ℣ that the Branches of a Tamarisk Tree are flourishing  Il  ℣ that the Warriors sometimes wash themselves in the Sea  Il  ℣ and sometimes refresh themselves by cool Breezes from the Sea  Il  ℣ that  Diomed  sleeps out of his Tent on the Ground  Il  ℣ that the Flies are very busy about the dead Body of  Patroclus Il  ℣ that  Apollo  covers the Body of  Hector  with a Cloud to prevent its being scorch'd  Il  ℣ All this would prove the very thing which was said at first that it was Summer He might next proceed to enquire what precise critical Time of Summer And here the mention of newmade Honey in  Il  ℣ might be of great Service in the Investigation of this important Matter He would conjecture from hence that it must be near the end of Summer Honey being seldom taken till that time to which having added the Plague which rages in Book and remark'd that Infections of that kind generally proceed from the extremest Heats which Heats are not till near the Autumn the learned Enquirer might hug himself in this Discovery and conclude with Triumph  If any one think this too ridiculous to have been ever put in Practice he may see what  Bossu  has done to determine the precise Season of the  Aeneid lib    ch  The Memory of that learned Critick fail'd him when he produc'd as one of the Proofs that it was Autumn a Passage in the  th  Book where the Fall of the Leaf is only mention'd in a  Simile  He has also found out a Beauty in  Homer  which few even of his greatest Admirers can believe he intended which is that to the  Violence  and  Fury  of the  Iliad  he artfully adapted the  Heat  of  Summer  but to the  Odysseis  the  cooler and maturer  Season of  Autumn  to correspond with the  Sedateness  and  Prudence  of  Ulysses  THE FOURTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  Juno  deceives  Jupiter  by the Girdle of  Venus  NEstor  sitting at the Table with  Machaon  is alarm'd with the encreasing Clamour of the War and hastens to  Agamemnon  On his way he meets that Prince with  Diomed  and  Ulysses  whom he informs of the Extremity of the Danger  Agamemnon  proposes to make their Escape by Night which  Ulysses  withstands to which  Diomed  adds his Advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the Army with their Presence which Advice is pursued  Juno  seeing the Partiality of  Jupiter  to the  Trojans  forms a Design to overreach him she sets off her Charms with the utmost Care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the Magick Girdle of  Venus  She then applies herself to the God of  Sleep  and with some Difficulty persuades him to seal the Eyes of  Jupiter  this done she goes to Mount  Ida  where the God at first sight is ravish'd with her Beauty sinks in her Embraces and is laid asleep  Neptune  takes Advantage of his Slumber and succours the  Greeks Hector  is struck to the Ground with a prodigious Stone by  Ajax  and carry'd off from the Battel Several Actions succeed till the  Trojans  much distress'd are obliged to give way The lesser  Ajax  signalizes himself in a particular manner  THE FOURTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  BUT nor the genial Feast nor flowing Bowl  Could charm the Cares of  Nestor  's watchful Soul  His startled Ears th' encreasing Cries attend  Then thus impatient to his wounded Friend  What new Alarm divine  Machaon  say  What mixt Events attend this mighty Day  Hark how the Shouts divide and how they meet  And now come full and thicken to the Fleet  Here with the cordial Draught dispel thy Care  Let  Hecamede  the strength'ning Bath prepare  Refresh thy Wound and cleanse the clotted Gore  While I th'Adventures of the Day explore  He said and seizing  Thrasimedes'  Shield  His valiant Offspring hasten'd to the Field  That Day the Son his Father's Buckler bore  Then snatch'd a Lance and issu'd from the Door  Soon as the Prospect open'd to his View  His wounded Eyes the Scene of Sorrow knew  Dire Disarray the Tumult of the Fight  The Wall in Ruins and the  Greeks  in Flight  As when old Ocean's silent Surface sleeps  The Waves just heaving on the purple Deeps  While yet th' expected Tempest hangs on high  Weighs down the Cloud and blackens in the Sky  The Mass of Waters will no Wind obey  Jove  sends one Gust and bids them roll away  While wav'ring Counsels thus his Mind engage  Fluctuates in doubtful Thought the  Pylian  Sage  To join the Host or to the Gen'ral haste  Debating long he fixes on the last  Yet as he moves the Fight his Bosom warms  The Field rings dreadful with the Clang of Arms  The gleaming Faulchions flash the Javelins fly  Blows echo Blows and all or kill or die  Him in his March the wounded Princes meet  By tardy Steps ascending from the Fleet  The King of Men  Ulysses  the divine  And who to  Tydeus  owes his noble Line  Their Ships at distance from the Battel stand  In Lines advanc'd along the shelving Strand  Whose Bay the Fleet unable to contain  At length beside the Margin of the Main  Rank above Rank the crowded Ships they moor  Who landed first lay highest on the Shore  Supported on their Spears they took their way  Unfit to fight but anxious for the Day  Nestor  's Approach alarm'd each  Grecian  Breast  Whom thus the Gen'ral of the Host addrest  O Grace and Glory of th'  Achaian  Name  What drives thee  Nestor  from the Field of Fame  Shall then proud  Hector  see his Boast fulfill'd  Our Fleets in Ashes and our Heroes kill'd  Such was his Threat ah now too soon made good  On many a  Grecian  Bosom writ in Blood  Is ev'ry Heart inflam'd with equal Rage  Against your King nor will one Chief engage  And have I liv'd to see with mournful Eyes  In ev'ry  Greek  a new  Achilles  rise  Gerenian Nestor  then So Fate has will'd  And allconfirming Time has Fate fulfill'd  Not he that thunders from th' aerial Bow'r  Not  Jove  himself upon the Past has pow'r  The Wall our late inviolable Bound  And best Defence lies smoaking on the Ground  Ev'n to the Ships their conqu'ring Arms extend  And Groans of slaughter'd  Greeks  to Heav'n ascend  On speedy Measures then employ your Thought  In such Distress if Counsel profit ought  Arms cannot much Tho'  Mars  our Souls incite  These gaping Wounds withhold us from the Fight  To him the Monarch That our Army bends  That  Troy  triumphant our high Fleet ascends  And that the Rampart late our surest Trust  And best Defence lies smoaking in the Dust  All this from  Jove  's afflictive Hand we bear  Who far from  Argos  wills our Ruin here  Past are the Days when happier  Greece  was blest  And all his Favour all his Aid confest  Now Heav'n averse our Hands from Battel ties  And lifts the  Trojan  Glory to the Skies  Cease we at length to waste our Blood in vain  And launch what Ships lie nearest to the Main  Leave these at Anchor till the coming Night  Then if impetuous  Troy  forbear the Fight  Bring all to Sea and hoist each Sail for flight  Better from Evils well foreseen to run  Than perish in the Danger we may shun  Thus he The sage  Ulysses  thus replies  While Anger flash'd from his disdainful Eyes  What shameful Words unkingly as thou art  Fall from that trembling Tongue and tim'rous Heart  Oh were thy Sway the Curse of meaner Pow'rs  And thou the Shame of any Host but ours  A Host by  Jove  endu'd with martial Might  And taught to conquer or to fall in Fight  Advent'rous Combats and bold Wars to wage  Employ'd our Youth and yet employs our Age  And wilt thou thus desert the  Trojan  Plain  And have whole Streams of Blood been spilt in vain  In such base Sentence if thou couch thy Fear  Speak it in Whispers lest a  Greek  should hear  Lives there a Man so dead to Fame who dares  To think such Meanness or the Thought declares  And comes it ev'n from him whose sov'reign Sway  The banded Legions of all  Greece  obey  Is this a Gen'ral's Voice that calls to flight  While War hangs doubtful while his Soldiers fight  What more could  Troy  What yet their Fate denies  Thou giv'st the Foe all  Greece  becomes their Prize  No more the Troops our hoisted Sails in view  Themselves abandon'd shall the Fight pursue  Thy Ships first flying with Despair shall see  And owe Destruction to a Prince like thee  Thy just Reproofs  Atrides  calm replies  Like Arrows pierce me for thy Words are wise  Unwilling as I am to lose the Host  I force not  Greece  to quit this hateful Coast  Glad I submit whoe'er or young or old  Ought more conducive to our Weal unfold  Tydides  cut him short and thus began  Such Counsel if you seek behold the Man  Who boldly gives it and what he shall say  Young tho' he be disdain not to obey  A Youth who from the mighty  Tydeus  springs  May speak to Councils and assembled Kings  Hear then in me the great  Oenides'  Son  Whose honour'd Dust his Race of Glory run  Lies whelm'd in Ruins of the  Theban  Wall  Brave in his Life and glorious in his Fall  With three bold Sons was gen'rous  Prothous  blest  Who  Pleuron  's Walls and  Calydon  possest  Melas  and  Agrius  but who surpast  The rest in Courage  Oeneus  was the last  From him my Sire from  Calydon  expell'd  He fled to  Argos  and in Exile dwell'd  The Monarch's Daughter there so  Jove  ordain'd  He won and flourish'd where  Adrastus  reign'd  There rich in Fortune's Gifts his Acres till'd  Beheld his Vines their liquid Harvest yield  And num'rous Flocks that whiten'd all the Field  Such  Tydeus  was the foremost once in Fame  Nor lives in  Greece  a Stranger to his Name  Then what for common Good my Thoughts inspire  Attend and in the Son respect the Sire  Tho' sore of Battel tho' with Wounds opprest  Let each go forth and animate the rest  Advance the Glory which he cannot share  Tho' not Partaker Witness of the War  But lest new Wounds on Wounds o'erpower us quite  Beyond the missile Javelin's sounding Flight  Safe let us stand and from the Tumult far  Inspire the Ranks and rule the distant War  He added not The list'ning Kings obey  Slow moving on  Atrides  leads the way  The God of Ocean to inflame their Rage  Appears a Hero furrow'd o'er with Age  Prest in his own the Gen'ral's Hand he took  And thus the venerable Warrior spoke  Atrides  lo with what disdainful Eye  Achilles  sees his Country's Forces fly  Blind impious Man whose Anger is his Guide  Who glories in inutterable Pride  So may he perish so may  Jove  disclaim  The Wretch relentless and o'erwhelm with Shame  But Heav'n forsakes not thee O'er yonder Sands  Soon shalt thou view the scatter'd  Trojan  Bands  Fly diverse while proud Kings and Chiefs renown'd  Driv'n Heaps on Heaps with Clouds involv'd around  Of rolling Dust their winged Wheels employ  To hide their ignominious Heads in  Troy  He spoke then rush'd amid the warring Crew  And sent his Voice before him as he flew  Loud as the Shout encountring Armies yield  When twice ten thousand shake the lab'ring Field  Such was the Voice and such the thund'ring Sound  Of him whose Trident rends the solid Ground  Each  Argive  Bosom beats to meet the Fight  And grizly War appears a pleasing Sight  Meantime  Saturnia  from  Olympus'  Brow  Highthron'd in Gold beheld the Fields below  With Joy the glorious Conflict she survey'd  Where her great Brother gave the  Grecians  Aid  But plac'd aloft on  Ida  's shady Height  She sees her  Jove

Goddess from th' aethereal Sky  And not her Steeds and flaming Chariot nigh  Then sheI haste to those remote Abodes  Where the great Parents of the deathless Gods  The rev'rend  Ocean  and grey  Tethys  reign  On the last Limits of the Land and Main  I visit these to whose indulgent Cares  I owe the nursing of my tender Years  For Strife I hear has made that Union cease  Which held so long this ancient Pair in Peace  The Steeds prepar'd my Chariot to convey  O'er Earth and Seas and thro' th' aërial way  Wait under  Ide  Of thy superior Pow'r  To ask Consent I leave th'  Olympian  Bow'r  Nor seek unknown to thee the sacred Cells  Deep under Seas where hoary  Ocean  dwells  For that said  Jove  suffice another Day  But eager Love denies the least Delay  Let softer Cares the present Hour employ  And be these Moments sacred all to Joy  Ne'er did my Soul so strong a Passion prove  Or for an earthly or a heav'nly Love  Not when I press'd  Ixion  's matchless Dame  Whence rose  Perithous  like the Gods in Fame  Not when fair  Danaë  felt the Show'r of Gold  Stream into Life whence  Perseus  brave and bold  Not thus I burn'd for either  Theban  Dame    Bacchus  from this from that  Alcides  came  Not  Phoenix'  Daughter beautiful and young  Whence godlike  Rhadamanth  and  Minos  sprung  Not thus I burn'd for fair  Latona  's Face  Nor comelier  Ceres'  more majestic Grace  Not thus ev'n for thy self I felt Desire  As now my Veins receive the pleasing Fire  He spoke the Goddess with the charming Eyes  Glows with celestial Red and thus replies  Is this a Scene for Love On  Ida  's Height  Expos'd to mortal and immortal Sight  Our Joys prophan'd by each familiar Eye  The Sport of Heav'n and Fable of the Sky  How shall I e'er review the blest Abodes  Or mix among the Senate of the Gods  Shall I not think that with disorder'd Charms  All Heav'n beholds me recent from thy Arms  With Skill divine has  Vulcan  form'd thy Bow'r  Sacred to Love and to the genial Hour  If such thy Will to that Recess retire  And secret there indulge thy soft Desire  She ceas'd and smiling with superior Love  Thus answer'd mild the Cloudcompelling  Jove  Nor God nor Mortal shall our Joys behold  Shaded with Clouds and circumfus'd in Gold  Not ev'n the Sun who darts thro' Heav'n his Rays  And whose broad Eye th' extended Earth surveys  Gazing he spoke and kindling at the view  His eager Arms around the Goddess threw  Glad Earth perceives and from her Bosom pours  Unbidden Herbs and voluntary Flow'rs  Thick newborn Vi'lets a soft Carpet spread  And clust'ring  Lotos  swell'd the rising Bed  And sudden Hyacinths the Turf bestrow  And flamy  Crocus  made the Mountain glow  There golden Clouds conceal the heav'nly Pair  Steep'd in soft Joys and circumfus'd with Air  Celestial Dews descending o'er the Ground  Perfume the Mount and breathe  Ambrosia  round  At length with Love and Sleep's soft Pow'r opprest  The panting Thund'rer nods and sinks to Rest  Now to the Navy born on silent Wings  To  Neptune  's Ear soft  Sleep  his Message brings  Beside him sudden unperceiv'd he stood  And thus with gentle Words address'd the God  Now  Neptune  now th' important Hour employ  To check a while the haughty Hopes of  Troy  While  Jove  yet rests while yet my Vapours shed  The golden Vision round his sacred Head  For  Juno  's Love and  Somnus'  pleasing Ties  Have clos'd those awful and eternal Eyes  Thus having said the Pow'r of Slumber flew  On human Lids to drop the balmy Dew  Neptune  with Zeal encreas'd renews his Care  And tow'ring in the foremost Ranks of War  Indignant thusOh once of martial Fame  O  Greeks  if yet ye can deserve the Name  This halfrecover'd Day shall  Troy  obtain  Shall  Hector  thunder at your Ships again  Lo still he vaunts and threats the Fleet with Fires  While stern  Achilles  in his Wrath retires  One Hero's Loss too tamely you deplore  Be still your selves and we shall need no more  Oh yet if Glory any Bosom warms  Brace on your firmest Helms and stand to Arms  His strongest Spear each valiant  Grecian  wield  Each valiant  Grecian  seize his broadest Shield  Let to the weak the lighter Arms belong  The pond'rous Targe be wielded by the strong  Thus arm'd not  Hector  shall our Presence stay  My self ye  Greeks  my self will lead the way  The Troops assent their martial Arms they change  The busy Chiefs their banded Legions range  The Kings tho' wounded and oppress'd with Pain  With helpful Hands themselves assist the Train  The strong and cumb'rous Arms the valiant wield  The weaker Warrior takes a lighter Shield  Thus sheath'd in shining Brass in bright Array  The Legions march and  Neptune  leads the way  His brandish'd Faulchion flames before their Eyes  Like Light'ning flashing thro' the frighted Skies  Clad in his Might th' Earthshaking Pow'r appears  Pale Mortals tremble and confess their Fears  Troy  's great Defender stands alone unaw'd  Arms his proud Host and dares oppose a God  And lo the God and wond'rous Man appear  The Sea's great Ruler there and  Hector  here  The roaring Main at her great Master's Call  Rose in huge Ranks and form'd a watry Wall  Around the Ships Seas hanging o'er the Shores  Both Armies join Earth thunders Ocean roars  Not half so loud the bellowing Deeps resound  When stormy Winds disclose the dark Profound  Less loud the Winds that from th'  Aeolian  Hall  Roar thro' the Woods and make whole Forests fall  Less loud the Woods when Flames in Torrents pour  Catch the dry Mountain and its Shades devour  With such a Rage the meeting Hosts are driv'n  And such a Clamour shakes the sounding Heav'n  The first bold Javelin urg'd by  Hector  's Force  Direct at  Ajax'  Bosom wing'd its Course  But there no Pass the crossing Belts afford  One brac'd his Shield and one sustain'd his Sword  Then back the disappointed  Trojan  drew  And curs'd the Lance that unavailing flew  But 'scap'd not  Ajax  his tempestuous Hand  A pond'rous Stone upheaving from the Sand  Where Heaps lay'd loose beneath the Warrior's Feet  Or serv'd to ballast or to prop the Fleet  Toss'd round and round the missive Marble flings  On the raz'd Shield the falling Ruin rings  Full on his Breast and Throat with Force descends  Nor deaden'd there its giddy Fury spends  But whirling on with many a fiery round  Smoaks in the Dust and ploughs into the Ground  As when the Bolt redhissing from above  Darts on the consecrated Plant of  Jove  The MountainOak in flaming Ruin lies  Black from the Blow and Smoaks of Sulphur rise  Stiff with Amaze the pale Beholders stand  And own the Terrors of th' Almighty Hand  So lies great  Hector  prostrate on the Shore  His slacken'd Hand deserts the Lance it bore  His following Shield the fallen Chief o'erspread  Beneath his Helmet drop'd his fainting Head  His Load of Armour sinking to the Ground  Clanks on the Field a dead and hollow Sound  Loud Shouts of Triumph fill the crowded Plain  Greece  sees in hope  Troy  's great Defender slain  All spring to seize him Storms of Arrows fly  And thicker Javelins intercept the Sky  In vain an Iron Tempest hisses round  He lies protected and without a Wound  Polydamas Agenor  the divine  The pious Warrior of  Anchises'  Line  And each bold Leader of the  Lycian  Band  With cov'ring Shields a friendly Circle stand  His mournful Followers with assistant Care  The groaning Hero to his Chariot bear  His foaming Coursers swifter than the Wind  Speed to the Town and leave the War behind  When now they touch'd the Mead's enamel'd Side  Where gentle  Xanthus  rolls his easy Tyde  With watry Drops the Chief they sprinkle round  Plac'd on the Margin of the flow'ry Ground  Rais'd on his Knees he now ejects the Gore  Now faints anew lowsinking on the Shore  By fits he breathes half views the fleeting Skies  And seals again by fits his swimming Eyes  Soon as the  Greeks  the Chief's Retreat beheld  With double Fury each invades the Field  Oïlean Ajax  first his Javelin sped  Pierc'd by whose Point the Son of  Enops  bled    Satnius  the brave whom beauteous  Neis  bore  Amidst her Flocks on  Satnio  's silver Shore  Struck thro' the Belly's Rim the Warrior lies  Supine and Shades eternal veil his Eyes  An arduous Battel rose around the dead  By turns the  Greeks  by turns the  Trojans  bled  Fir'd with Revenge  Polydamas  drew near  And at  Prothoenor  shook the trembling Spear  The driving Javelin thro' his Shoulder thrust  He sinks to Earth and grasps the bloody Dust  Lo thus the Victor cries we rule the Field  And thus their Arms the Race of  Panthus  wield  From this unerring Hand there flies no Dart  But bathes its Point within a  Grecian  Heart  Propt on that Spear to which thou ow'st thy Fall  Go guide thy darksome Steps to  Pluto  's dreary Hall  He said and Sorrow touch'd each  Argive  Breast  The Soul of  Ajax  burn'd above the rest  As by his side the groaning Warrior fell  At the fierce Foe he launch'd his piercing Steel  The Foe reclining shunn'd the flying Death  But Fate  Archelochus  demands thy Breath  Thy lofty Birth no Succour could impart  The Wings of Death o'ertook thee on the Dart  Swift to perform Heav'n's fatal Will it fled  Full on the Juncture of the Neck and Head  And took the Joint and cut the Nerves in twain  The dropping Head first tumbled to the Plain  So just the Stroke that yet the Body stood  Erect then roll'd along the Sands in Blood  Here proud  Polydamas  here turn thy Eyes  The tow'ring  Ajax  loudinsulting cries  Say is this Chief extended on the Plain  A worthy Vengeance for  Prothoenor  slain  Mark well his Port his Figure and his Face  Nor speak him vulgar nor of vulgar Race  Some Lines methinks may make his Lineage known  Antenor  's Brother or perhaps his Son  He spake and smil'd severe for well he knew  The bleeding Youth  Troy  sadden'd at the View  But furious  Acamas  aveng'd his Cause  As  Promachus  his slaughter'd Brother draws  He pierc'd his HeartSuch Fate attends you all  Proud  Argives  destin'd by our Arms to fall  Not  Troy  alone but haughty  Greece  shall share  The Toils the Sorrows and the Wounds of War  Behold your  Promachus  depriv'd of Breath  A Victim ow'd to my brave Brother's Death  Not unappeas'd He enters  Pluto  's Gate  Who leaves a Brother to revenge his Fate  Heartpiercing Anguish struck the  Grecian  Host  But touch'd the Breast of bold  Peneleus  most  At the proud Boaster he directs his Course  The Boaster flies and shuns superior Force  But young  Ilioneus  receiv'd the Spear  Ilioneus  his Father's only Care    Phorbas  the rich of all the  Trojan  Train  Whom  Hermes  lov'd and taught the Arts of Gain  Full in his Eye the Weapon chanc'd to fall  And from the Fibres scoop'd the rooted Ball  Drove thro' the Neck and hurl'd him to the Plain  He lifts his miserable Arms in vain  Swift his broad Faulchion fierce  Peneleus  spread  And from the spouting Shoulders struck his Head  To Earth at once the Head and Helmet fly  The Lance yet sticking thro' the bleeding Eye  The Victor seiz'd and as aloft he shook  The goary Visage thus insulting spoke  Trojans  your great  Ilioneus  behold  Haste to his Father let the Tale be told  Let his high Roofs resound with frantic Woe  Such as the House of  Promachus  must know  Let doleful Tidings greet his Mother's Ear  Such as to  Promachus'  sad Spouse we bear  When we victorious shall to  Greece  return  And the pale Matron in our Triumphs mourn  Dreadful he spoke then toss'd the Head on high  The  Trojans  hear they tremble and they fly  Aghast they gaze around the Fleet and Wall  And dread the Ruin that impends on all  Daughters of  Jove  that on  Olympus  shine  Ye allbeholding allrecording Nine  O say when  Neptune  made proud  Ilion  yield  What Chief

before  Oïleus'  Son  Fall mighty Numbers mighty Numbers run  Ajax  the less of all the  Grecian  Race  Skill'd in Pursuit and swiftest in the Chace  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Fourteenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOURTEENTH BOOK  I  THE Poet to advance the Character of  Nestor  and give us a due Esteem for his Conduct and Circumspection represents him as deeply sollicitous for the common Good In the very Article of Mirth or Relaxation from the Toils of War he is all Attention to learn the Fate and Issue of the Battel And through his long Use and Skill in martial Events he judges from the Quality of the Uproar still encreasing that the Fortune of the Day is held no longer in suspense but inclines to one side  Eustathius  II  VERSE  But nor the Genial Feast    At the end of the  th  Book we left  Nestor  at the Table with  Machaon  The Attack of the Entrenchments describ'd thro' the  th  and  th  Books happen'd while  Nestor  and  Machaon  sate at the Table nor is there any Improbability herein since there is nothing perform'd in those two Books but what might naturally happen in the Space of two Hours  Homer  constantly  follows the Thread of his Narration and never suffers his Reader to forget the Train of Action or the time it employs  Dacier  III  VERSE  Let  Hecamede  the Bath prepare    The Custom of Women officiating to Men in the Bath was usual in ancient Times Examples are frequent in the  Odysseis  And it is not at all more odd or to be sneer'd at than the Custom now us'd in  France  of  Valets de Chambres  dressing and undressing Ladies  IV  VERSE  As when old Ocean's silent Surface sleeps    There are no where more finish'd Pictures of Nature than those which  Homer  draws in several of his Comparisons The Beauty however of some of these will be lost to many who cannot perceive the Resemblance having never had Opportunity to observe the things themselves The Life of this Description will be most sensible to those who have been at Sea in a Calm In this Condition the Water is not entirely motionless but swells gently in smooth Waves which fluctuate backwards and forwards in a kind of balancing Motion This State continues till a rising Wind gives a Determination to the Waves and rolls 'em one certain way There is scarce any thing in the whole Compass of Nature that can more exactly represent the State of an irresolute Mind wavering between two different Designs sometimes inclining to the one sometimes to the other and then moving to the Point to which its Resolution is at last determin'd Every Circumstance of this Comparison is both beautiful and just and it is the more to be admir'd because it is very difficult to find sensible Images proper to represent the Motions of the Mind wherefore we but rarely meet with such Comparisons even in the best Poets There is one of great Beauty in  Virgil  upon a Subject very like this where he compares his Hero's Mind agitated with a great Variety and quick Succession  of Thoughts to a dancing Light reflected from a Vessel of Water in Motion  Cuncta videns magno curarum fluctuat aestu  Atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc  In partes{que} rapit varias perque omnia versat  Sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis  Sole repercussum aut radiantis imagine lunae  Omnia pervolitat latè loca jamque sub auras  Erigitur summique ferit laquearia tecti  Aen l ℣  V  VERSE  He fixes on the last    Nestor  appears in this Place a great Friend to his Prince for upon deliberating whether he should go through the Body of the  Grecian  Host or else repair to  Agamemnon  's Tent he determines at last and judges it the best way to go to the latter Now because it had been ill concerted to have made a Man of his Age walk a great way round about in quest of his Commander  Homer  has order'd it so that he should meet  Agamemnon  in his way thither And nothing could be better imagin'd than the reason why the wounded Princes left their Tents they were impatient to behold the Battel anxious for its Success and desirous to inspirit the Soldiers by their Presence The Poet was obliged to give a reason for in  Epic  Poetry as well as in  Dramatic  no Person ought to be introduced without some Necessity or at least some Probability for his Appearance  Eustathius  VI  VERSE  Their Ships at distance  c  Homer  being always careful to distinguish each Scene of Action gives a very particular Description of the Station of the Ships shewing in what manner they lay drawn up on the Land This he had only hinted at before but here taking occasion on the wounded Heroes coming from their Ships which were at a  distance from the Fight while others were engag'd in the Defence of those Ships where the Wall was broke down he tells us that the Shore of the Bay comprehended between the  Rhaetean  and  Sigaean  Promontories was not sufficient to contain the Ships in one Line which they were therefore obliged to draw up in Ranks ranged in parallel Lines along the Shore How many of these Lines there were the Poet does not determine M  Dacier  without giving any reason for her Opinion says they were but two one advanced near the Wall the other on the Verge of the Sea But it is more than probable that there were several intermediate Lines since the Order in which the Vessels lay is here describ'd by a Metaphor taken from the Steps of a  ScalingLadder  which had been no way proper to give an Image only of two Ranks but very fit to represent a greater tho' undetermin'd Number That there were more than two Lines may likewise be inferr'd from what we find in the beginning of the  th  Book where it is said that the Voice of  Discord  standing on the Ship of  Ulysses in the middle of the Fleet  was heard as far as the Stations of  Achilles  and  Ajax whose Ships were drawn up in the two Extremities  Those of  Ajax  were nearest the Wall as is expresly said in the  th  Verse of the  th  Book and those of  Achilles  nearest the Sea as appears from many Passages scatter'd thro' the Iliad  It must be suppos'd that those Ships were drawn highest upon Land which first approached the Shore the first Line therefore consisted of those who first disembark'd which were the Ships of  Ajax  and  Protesilaus  the latter of whom seems mention'd in the Verse above cited of the  th  Book only to give occasion to observe this for he was slain as he landed first of the  Greeks  And accordingly we shall see in the  th  Book it is his Ship that is first attack'd by the  Trojans  as it lay the nearest to them  We may likewise guess how it happens that the Ships of  Achilles  were plac'd nearest to the Sea for in the Answer of  Achilles  to  Ulysses  in the  th  Book ℣ he mentions a Naval Expedition he had made while  Agamemnon  lay safe in the Camp So that his Ships at their Return did naturally lie next the Sea which without this Consideration  might appear a Station not so becoming this Hero's Courage  VII  VERSE Nestor  's Approach alarm'd    That so laborious a Person as  Nestor  has been described so indefatigable so little indulgent of his extreme Age and one that never receded from the Battel should approach to meet them this it was that struck the Princes with Amazement when they saw he had left the Field  Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  Cease we at length  c  Agamemnon  either does not know what Course to take in this Distress or only sounds the Sentiments of his Nobles as he did in the second Book of the whole Army He delivers himself first after  Nestor  's Speech as it became a Counseller to do But knowing this Advice to be dishonourable and unsuitable to the Character he assumes elsewhere    c  and considering that he should do no better than abandon his Post when before he had threaten'd the Deserters with Death he reduces his Counsel into the Form of a Proverb disguising it as handsomly as he can under a Sentence  It is better to avoid an Evil  c It is observable too how he has qualify'd the Expression He does not say to  shun the Battel  for that had been unsoldierly but he softens the Phrase and calls it to shun  Evil  And this word  Evil  he applies twice together in advising them to leave the Engagement  It is farther remark'd that this was the noblest Opportunity for a General to try the Temper of his Officers for he knew that in a Calm of Affairs it was common with most People either out of Flattery or Respect to submit to their Leaders But in imminent Danger Fear does not bribe them but every one discovers his very Soul valuing all other Considerations in regard to his Safety but in the second Place He knew the Men he spoke to were prudent Persons and not easy to cast  themselves into a precipitate Flight He might likewise have a mind to recommend himself to his Army by the means of his Officers which he was not very able to do of himself angry as they were at him for the Affront he had offer'd  Achilles  and by Consequence thinking him the Author of all their present Calamities  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Oh were thy Sway the Curse of meaner Pow'rs  And thou the Shame of any Host but ours    This is a noble Complement to his Country and to the  Grecian  Army to shew that it was an Impossibility for them to follow even their General in any thing that was cowardly or shameful tho' the Lives and Safeties of 'em all were concern'd in it  X  VERSE  And comes it ev'n from him whose sov'reign Sway  The banded Legions of all  Greece  obey    As who should say that another Man might indeed have utter'd the same Advice but it could not be a Person of Prudence or if he had Prudence he could not be a Governour but a private Man or if a Governour yet one who had not a welldisciplin'd and obedient Army or lastly if he had an Army so condition'd yet it could not be so large and numerous an one as that of  Agamemnon  This is a fine Climax and of a wonderful Strength  Eustathius  XI  VERSE  Whoe'er or young or old  c  This nearly resembles an ancient Custom at  Athens  where in Times of Trouble and Distress every one of what Age or Quality soever was invited to give in his Opinion with Freedom by the publick Cryer  Eustathius  XII  VERSE This Speech of  Diomed  is naturally introduced beginning with an Answer as if he had been call'd upon to give his Advice The Counsel he proposes was that alone which could be of any real Service in their present Exigency However since he ventures to advise where  Ulysses  is at a Loss and  Nestor  himself silent he thinks it proper to apologize for this Liberty by reminding them of his Birth and Descent hoping thence to add to his Counsel a Weight and Authority which he could not from his Years and Experience It can't indeed be deny'd that this historical Digression seems more out of Season than any of the same kind which we so frequently meet with in  Homer  since his Birth and Parentage must have been sufficiently known to all at the Siege as he here tells them This must be own'd a Defect not altogether to be excus'd in the Poet but which may receive some Alleviation if consider'd as a Fault of Temperament For he had certainly a strong Inclination to genealogical Stories and too frequently takes occasion to gratify this Humour  XIII  VERSE  He fled to  Argos  This is a very artful Colour He calls the Flight of his Father for killing one of his Brothers  travelling and dwelling at  Argos without mentioning the Cause and Occasion of his Retreat What immediately follows  so  Jove  ordain'd  does not only contain in it a Disguise of his Crime but is a just Motive likewise for our Compassion  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Let each go forth and animate the rest    It is worth a Remark with what Management and Discretion the Poet has brought these four Kings and no more towards  the Engagement since these are sufficient alone to perform all that he requires For  Nestor  proposes to them to enquire if there be any way or means which Prudence can direct for their Security  Agamemnon  attempts to discover that Method  Ulysses  refutes him as one whose Method was dishonourable but proposes no other Project  Diomed  supplies that Deficiency and shews what must be done That wounded as they are they should go forth to the Battel for tho' they were not able to engage yet their Presence would reestablish their Affairs by detaining in Arms those who might otherwise quit the Field This Counsel is embrac'd and readily obey'd by the rest  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  The Story of  Jupiter  and  Juno  I don't know a bolder Fiction in all Antiquity than this of  Jupiter  's being deceiv'd and laid asleep or that has a greater Air of Impiety and Absurdity 'Tis an Observation of Mons  de St Evremond  upon the ancient Poets which every one will agree to  "that it is surprizing enough to find them so scrupulous to preserve Probability in Actions purely human and so ready to violate it in representing the Actions of the Gods Even those who have spoken more sagely than the rest of their Nature could not forbear to speak extravagantly of their Conduct When they establish their Being and their Attributes they make them immortal infinite almighty perfectly wise and perfectly good But the Moment they represent them acting there's no Weakness to which they do not make 'em stoop and no Folly or Wickedness they do not make 'em commit"  The same Author answers this in another Place by remarking  "that Truth was not the Inclination of the first Ages A foolish Lye or a lucky Falshood gave Reputation to Impostors and Pleasure to the credulous 'Twas the whole Secret of the great and the wise to govern the simple and ignorant Herd The vulgar who pay a profound Reverence to mysterious Errors would have despised plain Truth and it was thought a piece of Prudence to deceive them All the Discourses of  the Ancients were fitted to so advantagious a Design There was nothing to be seen but Fictions Allegories and Similitudes and nothing was to appear as it was in itself"  I must needs upon the whole as far as I can judge give up the Morality of this Fable but what Colour of Excuse for it  Homer  might have from ancient Tradition or what mystical or allegorical Sense might attone for the appearing Impiety is hard to be ascertain'd at this distant Period of Time That there had been before his Age a Tradition of  Jupiter  's being laid asleep appears from the Story of  Hercules  at  Coos  referr'd to by our Author ℣ There is also a Passage in  Diodorus lib    c  which gives some small Light to this Fiction Among other Reasons which that Historian lays down to prove that  Homer  travell'd into  Egypt  he alledges this Passage of the Interview of  Jupiter  and  Juno  which he says was grounded upon an  Egyptian  Festival  whereon the nuptial Ceremonies of these two Deities were celebrated at which time both their Tabernacles adorned with all sorts of Flowers are carry'd by the Priests to the top of a high Mountain  Indeed as the greatest Part of the Ceremonies of the ancient Religions consisted in some symbolical Representations of certain Actions of their Gods or rather deify'd Mortals so a great part of ancient Poetry consisted in the Description of the Actions exhibited in these Ceremonies The Loves of  Venus  and  Adonis  are a remarkable Instance of this kind which tho' under different Names were celebrated by annual Representations as well in  Egypt  as in several Nations of  Greece  and  Asia  and to the Images which were carry'd in these Festivals several ancient Poets were indebted for their most happy Descriptions If the Truth of this Observation of  Diodorus  be admitted the present Passage will appear with more Dignity being grounded on Religion and the Conduct of the Poet will be more justifiable if that which has been generally accounted an indecent wanton Fiction should prove to be the Representation of a religious Solemnity Considering the great Ignorance we are in of many ancient superstitious Ceremonies there may be probably in  Homer  many Incidents entirely of this Nature wherefore we ought to  be reserv'd in our Censures lest what we decry as wrong in the Poet should prove only a Fault in his Religion And indeed it would be a very unfair way to tax any People or any Age whatever with Grossness in general purely from the gross or absurd Ideas or Practices that are to be found in their Religions  In the next Place if we have recourse to Allegory which softens and reconciles every thing it may be imagin'd that by the Congress of  Jupiter  and  Juno  is meant the mingling of the  Aether  and the  Air  which are generally said to be signify'd by these two Deities The Ancients believ'd the  Aether  to be Igneous and that by its kind Influence upon the Air it was the Cause of all Vegetation To which nothing more exactly corresponds than the Fiction of the Earth putting forth her Flowers immediately upon this Congress  Virgil  has some Lines in the second  Georgic  that seem a perfect Explanation of the Fable into this Sense In describing the Spring he hints as if something of a vivifying Influence was at that time spread from the upper Heavens into the Air He calls  Jupiter  expresly  Aether  and represents him operating upon his Spouse for the Production of all things  Tum pater omnipotens foecundis imbribus aether  Conjugis in gremio laetae descendit omnes  Magnus alit magno commixtus corpore foetus  Parturit omnis ager  c  But be all this as it will it is certain that whatever may be thought of this Fable in a theological or philosophical View it is one of the most beautiful Pieces that ever was produc'd by Poetry Neither does it want its Moral an ingenious modern Writer whom I am pleas'd to take any occasion of quoting has given it us in these Words  "This Passage of  Homer  may suggest abundance of Instruction to a Woman who has a mind to preserve or recall the Affection of her Husband The Care of her Person and Dress with the particular Blandishments woven in the  Cestus  are so plainly recommended by this Fable  and so indispensably necessary in every Female who desires to please that they need no farther Explanation The Discretion likewise in covering all matrimonial Quarrels from the Knowledge of others is taught in the pretended Visit to  Tethys  in the Speech where  Juno  addresses herself to  Venus  as the chaste and prudent Management of a Wife's Charms is intimated by the same Pretence for her appearing before  Jupiter  and by the Concealment of the  Cestus  in her Bosom I shall leave this Tale to the Consideration of such good Houswives who are never well dress'd but when they are abroad and think it necessary to appear more agreeable to all Men living than their Husbands As also to those prudent Ladies who to avoid the Appearance of being overfond entertain their Husbands with Indifference Aversion sullen Silence or exasperating Language"  XVI  VERSE  Swift to her bright Apartment she repairs  c  This Passage may be of Consideration to the Ladies and for their sakes I take a little Pains to observe upon it  Homer  tells us that the very Goddesses who are all over Charms never dress in Sight of any one The Queen of Heaven adorns herself in private and the Doors lock after her In  Homer  there are no  Dieux des Ruelles  no Gods are admitted to the Toilette  I am afraid there are some earthly Goddesses of less Prudence who have lost much of the Adoration of Mankind by the contrary Practice  Lucretius  a very good Judge in Gallantry prescribes as a Cure to a desperate Lover the frequent Sight of his Mistress undress'd  Juno  herself has suffer'd a little by the very  Muse  's peeping into her Chamber since some nice Criticks are shock'd in this Place of  Homer  to find that the Goddess washes herself which presents some Idea as if she was dirty Those who have Delicacy will profit by this Remark  XVII  VERSE  Soft Oils of Fragrance    The Practice of  Juno  in anointing her Body with perfumed Oils was a remarkable part of ancient  Cosmeticks  tho' entirely disused in the modern Arts of Dress It may possibly offend the Niceness of modern Ladies but they who paint so artificially ought to consider that this Practice might without much greater Difficulty be reconciled to Cleanliness This Passage is a clear Instance of the Antiquity of this Custom and clearly determines against  Pliny  who is of Opinion that it was not so ancient as those times where speaking of perfum'd Unguents he says  Quis primus invenerit non traditur Iliacis temporibus non erant  lib c Besides the Custom of anointing Kings among the  Jews  which the Christians have borrow'd there are several Allusions in the Old Testament which shew that this Practice was thought ornamental among them The Psalmist speaking of the Gifts of God mentions Wine and Oil the former to make glad the Heart of Man and the latter to give him a chearful Countenance It seems most probable that this was an Eastern Invention agreeable to the Luxury of the  Asiaticks  among whom the most proper Ingredients for these Unguents were produc'd from them this Custom was propagated among the  Romans  by whom it was esteem'd a Pleasure of a very refin'd Nature Whoever is curious to see Instances of their Expence and Delicacy therein may be satisfy'd in the three first Chapters of the thirteenth Book of  Pliny  's Natural History  XVIII  VERSE  Thus while she breath'd of Heav'n  c  We have here a compleat Picture from Head to Foot of the Dress of the Fair Sex and of the Mode between two and three thousand Years ago May I have leave to observe the great Simplicity of  Juno  's Dress in Comparison with the innumerable  Equipage of a modern Toilette The Goddess even when she is setting herself out on the greatest Occasion has only her own Locks to tie a white Veil to cast over them a Mantle to dress her whole Body her Pendants and her Sandals This the Poet expresly says was  all her Dress    and one may reasonably conclude it was all that was used by the greatest Princesses and finest Beauties of those Times The good  Eustathius  is ravish'd to find that here are no Washes for the Face no Dies for the Hair and none of those artificial Embellishments since in Practice he also rejoices not a little that  Juno  has no LookingGlass TireWoman or waiting Maid One may preach till Doomsday on this Subject but all the Commentators in the World will never prevail upon a Lady to stick one Pin the less in her Gown except she can be convinced that the ancient Dress will better set off her Person  As the  Asiaticks  always surpass'd the  Grecians  in whatever regarded Magnificence and Luxury so we find their Women far gone in the contrary Extreme of Dress There is a Passage in  Isaiah  Ch that gives us a Particular of their Wardrobe with the Number and Uselessness of their Ornaments and which I think appears very well in Contrast to this of  Homer The Bravery of their tinkling Ornaments about their Feet and their Cauls and their round Tires like the Moon The Chains and the Bracelets and the Mufflers the Bonnets and the Ornaments of the Legs and the Headbands and the Tablets and the Earrings the Rings and Nosejewels the changeable Suits of Apparel and the Mantles and the Wimples and the CrispingPins the Glasses and the fine Linen and the Hoods and the Veils  I could be glad to ask the Ladies which they should like best to imitate the  Greeks  or the  Asiaticks  I would desire those that are handsome and wellmade to consider that the Dress of  Juno  which is the same they see in  Statues  has manifestly the Advantage of the present in displaying whatever is beautiful That the Charms of the  Neck  and  Breast  are not less laid open than by the modern Stays and that those of the  Leg  are more gracefully discover'd than even by the Hooppetticoat That the fine Turn of the  Arms  is better observ'd  and that several natural Graces of the  Shape  and  Body  appear much more conspicuous It is not to be deny'd but the  Asiatic  and our present Modes were better contriv'd to conceal some People's  Defects  but I don't speak to such People I speak only to Ladies of that Beauty who can make any Fashion prevail by their being seen in it and who put others of their Sex under the wretched Necessity of being like them in their Habits or not being like them at all As for the rest let 'em follow the Mode of  Judaea  and be content with the Name of  Asiaticks  XIX  VERSE  Thus issuing radiant  c  Thus the Goddess comes from her Apartment against her Spouse in compleat Armour The Pleasures of Women mostly prevail upon us by pure cunning and the artful Management of their Persons against which a wise Man ought to be upon his guard For there is but one way for the weak to subdue the mighty and that is by Pleasure The Poet shews at the same time that Men of Understanding are not master'd without a great deal of Artifice and Address There are but three ways whereby to overcome another by Violence by Persuasion or by Craft  Jupiter  was invincible by main Force to think of persuading was as fruitless after he had pass'd his Nod to  Achilles  therefore  Juno  was obliged of necessity to turn her Thoughts entirely upon Craft and by the Force of Pleasure it is that she insnares and manages the God  Eustathius  XX  VERSE  And calls the Mother of the  Smiles  and  Loves  Notwithstanding all the Pains  Juno  has been at to adorn herself she is still conscious that neither the natural Beauty of her Person nor the artificial one of her Dress will be sufficient to work upon a Husband She therefore has Recourse to the  Cestus  of  Venus  as a kind of Lovecharm not doubting to enflame his Mind by magical Enchantment a Folly  which in all Ages has possest her Sex To procure this she applies to the Goddess of Love from whom hiding her real Design under a feign'd Story another Propriety in the Character of the Fair she obtains the invaluable Present of this wonderworking Girdle The Allegory of the  Cestus  lies very open tho' the Impertinences of  Eustathius  on this Head are unspeakable In it are comprized the most powerful  Incentives  to Love as well as the strongest  Effects  of the Passion The just Admiration of this Passage has been al+ways so great and universal that the  Cestus  of  Venus  is become proverbial The Beauty of the Lines which in a few Words comprehend this agreeable Fiction can scarce be equall'd So beautiful an Original has produc'd very fine Imitations wherein we may observe a few additional Figures expressing some of the Improvements which the Affectation or Artifice of the Fair Sex have introduc'd into the Art of Love since  Homer  's Days  Tasso  has finely imitated this Description in the magical Girdle of  Armida Gierusalemme liberata  Cant  Teneri Sdegni e placide e tranquille  Repulse e cari vezzi e liete paci  Sorrisi parrolette e dolci stille  Di pianto e sospir tronchi e molli baci  Mons  de la Motte  's Imitation of this Fiction is likewise wonderfully beautiful  Ce tissu le simbole la cause à la sois  Du pouvoir d'l'Amour du charme de ses loix  Elle enflamme les yeux de cet Ardeur qui touche  D'un sourire enchanteur elle anime la bouche  Passionne la voix en adoucit les sons  Prête ces tours heureux plus forts que les raisons  Inspire pour toucher ces tendres stratagêmes  Ces resus attirans l'ecueil des sages mêmes  Et la nature enfin y voulut rensermer  Tout ce qui persuade ce qui fait aimer  En prenant ce tissu que Venus lui presente  Junon n'etoit que belle elle devient charmante  Les graces les ris les plaisirs les jeux  Surpris cherchent Venus doutent qui l'est des deux  L'Amour même trompè trouve Junon plus belle  Et son Arc à la main deja vole après elle  Spencer  in his  th  Book Canto describes a Girdle of  Venus  of a very different Nature for as this had the Power to raise up loose Desires in others that had a more wonderful Faculty to suppress them in the Person that wore it But it had a most dreadful Quality to burst asunder whenever tied about any but a chaste Bosom Such a Girdle 'tis to be fear'd would produce Essects very different from the other  Homer  's  Cestus  would be a Peacemaker to reconcile Man and Wife but  Spencer  's  Cestus  would probably destroy the good Agreement of many a happy Couple  XXI  VERSE  And prest The pow'rful Cestus to her snowy Breast    Eustathius  takes notice that the word  Cestus  is not the Name but Epithet only of  Venus  's Girdle tho' the Epithet has prevail'd so far as to become the proper Name in common use This has happen'd to others of our Author's Epithets the word  Pygmy  is of the same Nature  Venus  wore this Girdle below her Neck and in open Sight but  Juno  hides it in her Bosom to shew the difference of the two Characters It suits well with  Venus  to make a Shew of whatever is engaging in her but  Juno  who is a Matron of Prudence and Gravity ought to be more modest  XXII  VERSE  She speeds to  Lemnos  o'er the rolling Deep  And seeks the Cave of Death's Halfbrother  Sleep  In this Fiction  Homer  introduces a new divine Personage It does not appear whether this God of  Sleep  was a God of  Homer  's  Creation or whether his Pretensions to Divinity were of more ancient Date The Poet indeed speaks of him as of one formerly active in some heavenly Transactions Be this as it will succeeding Poets have always acknowledg'd his Title  Virgil  would not let his  Aeneid  be without a Person so proper for poetical Machinery tho' he has employ'd him with much less Art than his great Master since he appears in the  th  Book without Provocation or Commission only to destroy the  Trojan  Pilot The Criticks who cannot see all the Allegories which the Commentators pretend to find in  Homer  's Divinities must be obliged to acknowledge the Reality and Propriety of this since every thing that is here said of this imaginary Deity is justly applicable to Sleep He is called the  Brother  of  Death  is said to be protected by  Night  and is employed very naturally to lull a Husband to Rest in the Embraces of his Wife which Effect of this  Conjugal Opiate  even the modest  Virgil  has remark'd in the Persons of  Vulcan  and  Venus  probably with an Eye to this Passage of  Homer  Placidumque petivit  Conjugis infusus gremio per membra soporem  XXIII  VERSE  To  Lemnos  The Commentators are hard put to it to give a Reason why  Juno  seeks for  Sleep  in  Lemnos  Some finding out that  Lemnos  anciently abounded with Wine inform us that it was a proper Place of Residence for him Wine being naturally a great Provoker of Sleep Others will have it that this God being in love with  Pasithaë  who resided with her Sister the Wife of  Vulcan  in  Lemnos  it was very probable he might be found haunting near his Mistress Other Commentators perceiving the Weakness of these Conjectures will have it that  Juno  met  Sleep  here by mere Accident but this is contradictory to the whole Thread of the Narration But who knows whether  Homer  might not design this Fiction as a Piece of Raillery upon the Sluggishness of the  Lemnians  tho' this Character of them does not appear  A kind of Satyr like that of  Ariosto  who makes the Angel find  Discord  in a Monastery Or like that of  Boileau  in his  Lutrin  where he places  Mollesse  in a Dormitory of the Monks of St  Bernard  XXIV  VERSE  Sweetpleasing Sleep  c  Virgil  has copied some part of this Conversation between  Juno  and  Sleep  where he introduces the same Goddess making a Request to  Aeolus Scaliger  who is always eager to depreciate  Homer  and zealous to praise his favourite Author has highly censured this Passage But notwithstanding this Critick's Judgment an impartial Reader will find I don't doubt much more Art and Beauty in the Original than the Copy In the former  Juno  endeavours to engage  Sleep  in her Design by the Promise of a proper and valuable Present but having formerly run a great Hazard in a like Attempt he is not prevail'd upon Hereupon the Goddess knowing his Passion for one of the  Graces  engages to give her to his Desires This Hope brings the Lover to Consent but not before he obliges  Juno  to confirm her Promise by an Oath in a most solemn manner the very Words and Ceremony whereof he prescribes to her These are all beautiful and poetical Circumstances most whereof are untouch'd by  Virgil  and which  Scaliger  therefore calls low and vulgar He only makes  Juno  demand a Favour from  Aeolus  which he had no reason to refuse and promise him a Reward which it does not appear he was fond of The  Latin  Poet has indeed with great Judgment added one Circumstance concerning the Promise of Children  pulchrâ faciat te prole parentem  And this is very conformable to the Religion of the  Romans  among whom  Juno  was suppos'd to preside over human Births but it does not appear she had any such Office in the  Greek  Theology  XXV  VERSE  A splendid Footstool    Notwithstanding the Cavils of  Scaliger  it may be allow'd that an easy Chair was no improper Present for  Sleep  As to the Footstool Mad  Dacier  's Observation is a very just one that besides its being a Conveniency it was a Mark of Honour and was far from presenting any low or trivial Idea 'Tis upon that Account we find it so frequently mention'd in Scripture where the Earth is call'd  the Footstool of the Throne of God  In  Jeremiah Judaea  is call'd as a Mark of Distinction the Footstool of the Feet of God  Lament  ℣  And he remember'd not the Footstool of his Feet in the Day of his Wrath  We see here the same Image founded no doubt upon the same Customs  Dacier  XXVI  VERSE  The Sire of all old  Ocean  "  Homer  says  Plutarch  calls the Sea  Father of All  with a View to this Doctrine that all things were generated from Water  Thales  the  Milesian  the Head of the  Ionick  Sect who seems to have been the first Author of Philosophy affirmed Water to be the Principle from whence all things spring and into which all things are resolv'd because the prolific Seed of all Animals is a Moisture all Plants are nourished by Moisture the very Sun and Stars which are Fire are nourished by moist Vapours and Exhalations and consequently he thought the World was produc'd from this Element"  Plut  Opin of Philos  lib c  XXVII  VERSE  But how unbidden  c  This Particularity is worth remarking  Sleep  tells  Juno  that he dares not approach  Jupiter  without his own Order whereby he seems to intimate that a Spirit of a superior kind may give itself up  to a voluntary Cessation of Thought and Action tho' it does not want this Relaxation from any Weakness or Necessity of its Nature  XXVIII  VERSE  Whattime deserting  Ilion  's wasted Plain  c  One may observe from hence that to make Falsity in Fables useful and subservient to our Designs it is not enough to cause the Story to resemble Truth but we are to corroborate it by parallel Places which Method the Poet uses elsewhere Thus many have attempted great Difficulties and surmounted 'em So did  Hercules  so did  Juno  so did  Pluto  Here therefore the Poet feigning that  Sleep  is going to practise insidiously upon  Jove  prevents the Strangeness and Incredibility of the Tale by squaring it to an ancient Story which ancient Story was that  Sleep  had once before got the mastery of  Jove  in the case of  Hercules Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE  Ev'n  Jove  rever'd the venerable Dame    Jupiter  is represented as unwilling to do any thing that might be offensive or ungrateful to  Night  the Poet says  Eustathius  instructs us by this that a wise and honest Man will curb his Wrath before any awful and venerable Person Such was  Night  in regard of  Jupiter  feign'd as an Ancestor and honourable on account of her Antiquity and Power For the  Greek  Theology teaches that  Night  and  Chaos  were before all things Wherefore it was held sacred to obey the  Night  in the Conflicts of War as we find by the Admonitions of the Heralds to  Hector  and  Ajax  in the  th  Iliad  Milton  has made a fine Use of this ancient Opinion in relation to  Chaos  and  Night  in the latter Part of his second Book where he describes the Passage of  Satan  thro' their Empire He calls them  Eldest  Night  And  Chaos  Ancestors of Nature  And alludes to the same in those noble Verses  Behold the Throne  Of  Chaos  and his dark Pavillion spread  Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthron'd  Sate sablevested  Night  eldest of things  The Consort of his Reign  That fine Apostrophe of  Spenser  has also the same Allusion Book  O thou most ancient Grandmother of all  More old than  Jove  whom thou at first didst breed  Or that great House of Gods coelestial  Which was begot in  Daemogorgon's  Hall  And saw'st the Secrets of the World unmade  XXX  VERSE  Let the great Parent Earth one Hand sustain  And stretch the other o'er the sacred Main  c  There is something wonderfully solemn in this manner of Swearing propos'd by  Sleep  to  Juno  How answerable is this Idea to the Dignity of the Queen of the Goddesses where Earth Ocean and Hell itself where the whole Creation all things visible and invisible are call'd to be Witnesses of the Oath of the Deity  XXXI  VERSE  That she my lov'd one  c  Sleep  is here made to repeat the Words of  Juno  's Promise than which Repetition nothing I think can be more beautiful or better placed The Lover fired with these Hopes insists on the Promise dwelling with Pleasure on each Circumstance that relates to his fair one The Throne and Footstool it seems are quite out of his Head  XXXII  VERSE  Fair  Ida  trembles    It is usually suppos'd at the Approach or Presence of any heavenly Being that upon their Motion all should shake that lies beneath 'em Here the Poet giving a Description of the Descent of these Deities upon the Ground at  Lectos  says that the loftiest of the Wood trembled under their Feet Which Expression is to intimate the Lightness and Swiftness of the Motions of heavenly Beings the Wood does not shake under their Feet from any corporeal Weight but from a certain awful Dread and Horror  Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE  In Likeness of a Bird of Night    This is a Bird of Night about the Size of a Hawk entirely black and that is the reason why  Homer  describes  Sleep  under its Form Here says  Eustathius    Homer  lets us know as well as in many other Places that he is no Stranger to the Language of the Gods  Hobbes  has taken very much from the Dignity of this Supposition in translating the present Lines in this manner  And there sate  Sleep  in Likeness of a Fowl  Which Gods do  Chalcis  call but Men an Owl  We find in  Plato  's  Cratylus  a Discourse of great Subtility grounded chiefly on this Observation of  Homer  that the Gods and Men call the same thing by different Names The Philosopher supposes that in the original Language every thing was express'd by a word whose Sound was naturally apt to mark the Nature of the thing signify'd This great Work he ascribes to the Gods since it required more Knowledge both in the Nature of Sounds and Things than Man had attain'd to This Resemblance he says was almost lost in modern Languages by the unskilful Alterations Men had made and the great Licence they had taken in compounding  of Words However he observes there were yet among the  Greeks  some Remains of this original Language of which he gives a few Instances adding that many more were to be found in some of the barbarous Languages that had deviated less from the Original which was still preserv'd entire among the Gods This appears a Notion so uncommon that I could not forbear to mention it  XXXIV  VERSE  To whose indulgent Cares I owe the Nursing  c  The Allegory of this is very obvious  Juno  is constantly understood to be the  Air  and we are here told she was nourished by  Oceanus  and  Tethys  That is to say the  Air  is fed and nourished by the Vapours which rise from the  Ocean  and the  Earth  For  Tethys  is the same with  Rhea Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE This Courtship of  Jupiter  to  Juno  may possibly be thought pretty singular He endeavours to prove the Ardour of his Passion to her by the Instances of its Warmth to other Women A great many People will look upon this as no very likely Method to recommend himself to  Juno  's Favour Yet after all something may be said in Defence of  Jupiter  's way of thinking with respect to the Ladies Perhaps a Man's Love to the Sex in general may be no ill Recommendation of him to a Particular And to be known or thought to have been successful with a good many is what some Moderns have found no unfortunate Qualification in gaining a Lady even a most virtuous one like  Juno  especially one who like her has had the Experience of a married State  XXXVI  VERSE  Glad Earth perceives  c  It is an Observation of  Aristotle  in the  th  Chapter of his Poeticks that  when  Homer  is obliged to describe any thing of itself absurd or too improbable he constantly contrives to blind and dazle the Judgment of his Readers with some shining Description This Passage is a remarkable Instance of that Artifice for having imagined a Fiction of very great Absurdity that the supreme Being should be laid asleep in a female Embrace he immediately as it were to divert his Reader from reflecting on his Boldness pours forth a great Variety of poetical Ornaments by describing the various Flowers the Earth shoots up to compose their Couch the golden Clouds that encompass'd them and the bright heavenly Dews that were shower'd round them  Eustathius  observes it as an Instance of  Homer  's modest Conduct in so delicate an Affair that he has purposely adorn'd the Bed of  Jupiter  with such a Variety of beautiful Flowers that the Reader's Thoughts being entirely taken up with these Ornaments might have no room for loose Imaginations In the same manner an ancient Scholiast has observ'd that the golden Cloud was contriv'd to lock up this Action from any farther Enquiry of the Reader  XXXVII  VERSE I cannot conclude the Notes on this Story of  Jupiter  and  Juno  without observing with what particular Care  Milton  has imitated the several beautiful Parts of this Episode introducing them upon different Occasions as the Subjects of his Poem would admit The Circumstance of  Sleep  's sitting in Likeness of a Bird on the FirTree upon Mount  Ida  is alluded to in his  th  Book where  Satan  sits in Likeness of a Cormorant on the Tree of Life The Creation is made to give the same Tokens of Joy at the Performance of the nuptial Rites of our first Parents as she does here at the Congress of  Jupiter  and  Juno Lib    To the nuptial Bow'r  I led her blushing like the Morn all Heav'n  And happy Constellations on that Hour  Shed their selectest Influence the Earth  Gave sign of Gratulation and each Hill  Joyous the Birds fresh Gales and gentle Airs  Whisper'd it to the Woods and from their Wings  Flung Rose flung Odours from the spicy Shrub  Those Lines also in the  th  Book are manifestly from the same Original  Roses and Jessamine  Rear'd high their flourish'd Heads between and wrought  Mosaic underfoot the Violet  Crocus and Hyacinth with rich Inlay  Broider'd the Ground  Where the very Turn of  Homer  's Verses is observed and the Cadence and almost the Words finely translated  But it is with wonderful Judgment and Decency he has used that exceptionable Passage of the Dalliance Ardour and Enjoyment That which seems in  Homer  an impious Fiction becomes a moral Lesson in  Milton  since he makes that lascivious Rage of the Passion the immediate Effect of the Sin of our first Parents after the Fall  Adam  expresses it in the Words of  Jupiter  For never did thy Beauty since the Day  I saw thee first and wedded thee adorn'd  With all Perfections so enflame my Sense  With Ardour to enjoy thee fairer now  Than ever Bounty of this virtuous Tree  So said he and forbore not Glance or Toy  Of amorous Intent well understood  Of  Eve  whose Eye darted contagious Fire  Her Hand he seiz'd and to a shady Bank  Thick overhead with verdant Roof embow'r'd  He led her nothing loath Flow'rs were the Couch  Pansies and Violets and Asphodel  And Hyacinth Earth's freshest softest Lap  There they their Fill of Love and Love's Disport  Took largely of their mutual Guilt the Seal  The Solace of their Sin till dewy  Sleep  Oppress'd them weary of their amorous Play  Milton  l    XXXVIII  VERSE  The Pow'r of Slumbers flew    M  Dacier  in her Translation of this Passage has thought fit to dissent from the common Interpretation as well as obvious Sense of the Words She restrains the general Expression    the famous Nations of Men  to signify only the Country of the  Lemnians  who she says were much  celebrated  on account of  Vulcan  But this strain'd Interpretation cannot be admitted especially when the obvious Meaning of the Words express what is very proper and natural The God of  Sleep  having hastily delivered his Message to  Neptune  immediately leaves the Hurry of the Battel which was no proper Scene for him and retires among the Tribes of Mankind The word  on which M  Dacier  grounds her Criticism is an expletive Epithet very common in  Homer  and no way fit to point out one certain Nation especially in an Author one of whose most distinguishing Characters is Particularity in Description  XXXIX  VERSE  The Legions march and  Neptune  leads the way    The chief Advantage the  Greeks  gain by the Sleep of  Jupiter  seems to be this  Neptune  unwilling to offend  Jupiter  has hitherto concealed himself in disguised Shapes so that it does not appear that  Jupiter  knew of his being among the  Greeks  since he takes no notice of it This Precaution hinders him from assisting the  Greeks  otherwise than by his Advice But upon the Intelligence receiv'd of what  Juno  had done he assumes a Form that manifests his Divinity inspiring Courage into the  Grecian  Chiefs appearing at the Head of their Army brandishing a Sword in his Hand the Sight of which struck such a Terror into the  Trojans  that  as  Homer  says none durst approach it And therefore it is not to be wonder'd that the  Trojans  who are no longer sustain'd by  Jupiter  immediately give way to the Enemy  XL  VERSE  The weaker Warrior takes a lighter Shield    Plutarch  seems to allude to this Passage in the beginning of the Life of  Pelopidas  "  Homer  says he makes the bravest and stoutest of his Warriors march to Battel in the best Arms The  Grecian  Legislators punish'd those who cast away their Shields but not those who lost their Spears or their Swords as an Intimation that the Care of preserving and defending our selves is preferable to the wounding our Enemy especially in those who are Generals of Armies or Governors of States"  Eustathius  has observ'd that the Poet here makes the best Warriors take the largest Shields and longest Spears that they might be ready prepar'd with proper Arms both offensive and defensive for a new kind of Fight in which they are soon to be engaged when the Fleet is attack'd Which indeed seems the most rational Account that can be given for  Neptune  's Advice in this Exigence  Mr  Hobbes  has committed a great Oversight in this Place he makes the wounded Princes who it is plain were unfit for the Battel and do not engage in the ensuing Fight put on Arms as well as the others whereas they do no more in  Homer  than see their Orders obey'd by the rest as to this Change of Arms  XLI  VERSE  And lo the God and wondrous Man appear    What Magnificence and Nobleness is there in this Idea where  Homer  opposes  Hector  to  Neptune  and equalizes him in some degree to a God  Eustathius  XLII  VERSE  The roaring Main  c  This swelling and Inundation of the Sea towards the  Grecian  Camp as if it had been agitated by a Storm is meant for a Prodigy intimating that the Waters had the same Resentments with their Commander  Neptune  and seconded him in his Quarrel  Eustathius  XLIII  VERSE  Not half so loud  c  The Poet having ended the Episode of  Jupiter  and  Juno  returns to the Battel where the  Greeks  being animated and led on by  Neptune  renew the Fight with Vigour The Noise and Outcry of this fresh Onset he endeavours to express by these three sounding Comparisons as if he thought it necessary to awake the Reader's Attention which by the preceding Descriptions might be lull'd into a Forgetfulness of the Fight He might likewise design to shew how soundly  Jupiter  slept since he is not awak'd by so terrible an Uproar  This Passage cannot be thought justly liable to the Objections which have been made against heaping Comparisons one upon another whereby the principal Object is lost amidst too great a Variety of different Images In this Case the principal Image is more strongly impress'd on the Mind by a Multiplication of Similes which are the natural Product of an Imagination labouring to express something very vast But finding no single Idea sufficient to answer its Conceptions it endeavours by redoubling the Comparisons to supply this Defect the different Sounds of Waters Winds and Flames being as it were united in one We have several Instances of this sort even in so castigated and reserv'd a Writer as  Virgil  who has joined together the Images of this Passage in the  th Georgic  ℣ and apply'd them beautifully softened by a kind of Parody to the buzzing of a Beehive  Frigidus ut quondam sylvis immurmurat Auster  Ut mare sollicitum stridet refluentibus undis  Aestuat ut clausis rapidus fornacibus ignis  Tasso  has not only imitated this particular Passage of  Homer  but likewise added to it  Cant    St    Rapido si che torbida procella  De cavernosi monti esce piu tarda  Fiume ch' alberi insieme e case svella  Folgore che le torri abbatta arda  Terremoto che'l mondo empia d'horrore  Son picciole sembianze al suo furore  XLIV  VERSE  Smoaks in the Dust and ploughs into the Ground    c  These Words are translated by several as if they signify'd that  Hector  was turn'd round with the Blow like a Whirlwind which would enhance the wonderful Greatness of  Ajax  's Strength  Eustathius  rather inclines to refer the Words to the Stone itself and the Violence of its Motion  Chapman  I think is in the right to prefer the latter but he should not have taken the Interpretation to himself He says it is above the Wit of Man to give a more fiery Illustration both of  Ajax  's Strength and  Hector  's of  Ajax  for giving such a Force to the Stone that it could not spend itself on  Hector  but afterwards turn'd upon the Earth with that Violence and of  Hector  for standing the Blow so solidly for without that Consideration the Stone could never have recoil'd so fiercely This Image together with the noble Simile following it seem to have given  Spencer  the Hint of those sublime Verses  As when almighty  Jove  in wrathsul Mood  To wreak the Guilt of mortal Sins is bent  Hurls forth his thund'ring Dart with deadly Food  Enroll'd of Flames and smouldring Dreariment  Thro' riven Clouds and molten Firmament  The fierce threeforked Engine making way  Both lofty Tow'rs and highest Trees hath rent  And all that might his dreadful Passage stay  And shooting in the Earth casts up a Mound of Clay  His boist'rous Club so bury'd in the Ground  He could not rear again  c    XLV  VERSE  Propt on that Spear  c  The occasion of this Sarcasm of  Polydamas  seems taken from the Attitude of his falling Enemy who is transfixed with a Spear thro' his right Shoulder This Posture bearing some Resemblance to that of a Man leaning on a Staff might probably suggest this Conceit  The Speech of  Polydamas  begins a long String of Sarcastick Raillery in which  Eustathius  pretends to observe very different Characters This of  Polydamas  he says is  pleasant  that of  Ajax heroic  that of  Acamas plain  and that of  Peneleus pathetick  XLVI  VERSE  Daughters of  Jove c  Whenever we meet with these fresh Invocations in the midst of Action the Poets would seem to give their Readers to understand that they are come to a Point where the Description being above their own Strength they have occasion for supernatural Assistance by this Artifice at once exciting the Reader's Attention and gracefully varying the Narration In the present case  Homer  seems to triumph in the Advantage the  Greeks  had gain'd in the Flight of the  Trojans  by invoking the Muses to snatch the brave Actions of his Heroes from Oblivion and set them in the Light of Eternity This Power is vindicated to them by the Poets on every occasion and it is to this Task they  are so solemnly and frequently summon'd by our Author  Tasso  has I think introduced one of these Invocations in a very noble and peculiar manner where on occasion of a Battle by Night he calls upon the Night to allow him to draw forth those mighty Deeds which were perform'd under the Concealment of her Shades and to display their Glories notwithstanding that Disadvantage to all Posterity  Notte che nel profondo oscuro seno  Chiudesti e ne l'oblio fatto si grande  Piacciati ch'io nel tragga e'n bel sereno  A la future età lo spieghi e mande  Viva la fame loro e trà lor gloria  Splenda del fosco tuo l'alta memoria  THE FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The fifth Battel at the Ships and the Acts of  Ajax  JUpiter  awaking sees the  Trojans  repuls'd from the Trenches  Hector  in a Swoon

the Gods attempts with extraordinary Address to incense them against  Jupiter  in particular she touches  Mars  with a violent Resentment He is ready to take Arms but is prevented by  Minerva Iris

Fields he cast a careful view  There saw the  Trojans  fly the  Greeks  pursue  These proud in Arms those scatter'd o'er the Plain  And 'midst the War the Monarch of the Main  Not far great  Hector  on the Dust he spies  His sad Associates round with weeping Eyes  Ejecting Blood and panting yet for Breath  His Senses wandring to the Verge of Death  The God beheld him with a pitying Look  And thus incens'd to fraudful  Juno  spoke  O thou still adverse to th' eternal Will  For ever studious in promoting Ill  Thy Arts have made the godlike  Hector  yield  And driv'n his conqu'ring Squadrons from the Field  Can'st thou unhappy in thy Wiles withstand  Our Pow'r immense and brave th' Almighty Hand  Hast thou forgot when bound and fix'd on high  From the vast Concave of the spangled Sky  I hung thee trembling in a golden Chain  And all the raging Gods oppos'd in vain  Headlong I hurl'd them from th'  Olympian  Hall  Stunn'd in the Whirl and breathless with the Fall  For godlike  Hercules  these Deeds were done  Nor seem'd the Vengeance worthy such a Son  When by thy Wiles induc'd fierce  Boreas  tost  The shipwrack'd Hero on the  Coan  Coast  Him thro' a thousand Forms of Death I bore  And sent to  Argos  and his native Shore  Hear this remember and our Fury dread  Nor pull th' unwilling Vengeance on thy Head  Lest Arts and Blandishments successless prove  Thy soft Deceits and welldissembled Love  The Thund'rer spoke Imperial  Juno  mourn'd  And trembling these submissive Words return'd  By ev'ry Oath that Pow'rs immortal ties  The foodful Earth and allinfolding Skies  By thy black Waves tremendous  Styx  that flow  Thro' the drear Realms of gliding Ghosts below  By the dread Honours of thy sacred Head  And that unbroken Vow our Virgin Bed  Not by my Arts the Rulet of the Main  Steeps  Troy  in Blood and rages round the Plain  By his own Ardour his own Pity sway'd  To help his  Greeks  he fought and disobey'd  Else had thy  Juno  better Counsels giv'n  And taught Submission to the Sire of Heav'n  Think'st thou with me fair Empress of the Skies  Th' immortal Father with a Smile replies  Then soon the haughty SeaGod shall obey  Nor dare to act but when we point the way  If Truth inspires thy Tongue proclaim our Will  To yon' bright Synod on th'  Olympian  Hill  Our high Decree let various  Iris  know  And call the God that bears the silver Bow  Let her descend and from th' embattel'd Plain  Command the SeaGod to his watry Reign  While  Phoebus  hastes great  Hector  to prepare  To rise afresh and once more wake the War  His lab'ring Bosom reinspires with Breath  And calls his Senses from the Verge of Death  Greece  chas'd by  Troy  ev'n to  Achilles'  Fleet  Shall fall by thousands at the Hero's Feet  He not untouch'd with Pity to the Plain  Shall send  Patroclus  but shall send in vain  What Youth he slaughters under  Ilion  's Walls  Ev'n my lov'd Son divine  Sarpedon  falls  Vanquish'd at last by  Hector  's Lance he lies  Then nor till then shall great  Achilles  rise  And lo that Instant godlike  Hector  dies  From that great Hour the War's whole Fortune turns  Pallas  assists and lofty  Ilion  burns  Not till that Day shall  Jove  relax his Rage  Nor one of all the heav'nly Host engage  In aid of  Greece  The Promise of a God  I gave and seal'd it with th' Almighty Nod  Achilles'  Glory to the Stars to raise  Such was our Word and Fate the Word obeys  The trembling Queen th' Almighty Order giv'n  Swift from th'  Idaean  Summit shot to Heav'n  As some wayfaring Man who wanders o'er  In Thought a Length of Lands he trod before  Sends forth his active Mind from Place to Place  Joins Hill to Dale and measures Space with Space  So swift flew  Juno  to the blest Abodes  If Thought of Man can match the Speed of Gods  There sate the Pow'rs in awful Synod plac'd  They bow'd and made Obeysance as she pass'd  Thro' all the brazen Dome With Goblets crown'd  They hail her Queen the  Nectar  streams around  Fair  Themis  first presents the golden Bowl  And anxious asks what Cares disturb her Soul  To whom the whitearm'd Goddess thus replies  Enough thou know'st the Tyrant of the Skies  Severely bent his Purpose to fulfill  Unmov'd his Mind and unrestrain'd his Will  Go thou the Feasts of Heav'n attend thy Call  Bid the crown'd Nectar circle round the Hall  But  Jove  shall thunder thro' th' Ethereal Dome  Such stern Decrees such threatned Woes to come  As soon shall freeze Mankind with dire Surprize  And damp th' eternal Banquets of the Skies  The Goddess said and sullen took her Place  Blank Horror sadden'd each celestial Face  To see the gath'ring Grudge in ev'ry Breast  Smiles on her Lips a spleenful Joy exprest  While on her wrinkled Front and Eyebrow bent  Sate stedfast Care and low'ring Discontent  Thus she proceedsAttend ye Pow'rs above  But know 'tis Madness to contest with  Jove  Supreme he sits and sees in Pride of Sway  Your Vassal Godheads grudgingly obey  Fierce in the Majesty of Pow'r controuls  Shakes all the Thrones of Heav'n and bends the Poles  Submiss Immortals all he wills obey  And thou great  Mars  begin and shew the way  Behold  Ascalaphus  behold him die  But dare not murmur dare not vent a Sigh  Thy own lov'd boasted Offspring lies o'erthrown  If that lov'd boasted Offspring be thy own  Stern  Mars  with Anguish for his slaughter'd Son  Smote his rebelling Breast and fierce begun  Thus then Immortals thus shall  Mars  obey  Forgive me Gods and yield my Vengeance way  Descending first to yon' forbidden Plain  The God of Battels dares avenge the slain  Dares tho' the Thunder bursting o'er my Head  Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead  With that he gives command to  Fear  and  Flight  To join his rapid Coursers for the Fight  Then grim in Arms with hasty Vengeance flies  Arms that reflect a Radiance thro' the Skies  And now had  Jove  by bold Rebellion driv'n  Discharg'd his Wrath on half the Host of Heav'n  But  Pallas  springing thro' the bright Abode  Starts from her azure Throne to calm the God  Struck for th' immortal Race with timely Fear  From frantic  Mars  she snatch'd the Shield and Spear  Then the huge Helmet lifting from his Head  Thus to th' impetuous Homicide she said  By what wild Passion Furious art thou tost  Striv'st thou with  Jove  Thou art already lost  Shall not the Thund'rer's dread Command restrain  And was Imperial  Juno  heard in vain  Back to the Skies would'st thou with Shame be driv'n  And in thy Guilt involve the Host of Heav'n  Ilion  and  Greece  no more should  Jove  engage  The Skies would yield an ampler Scene of Rage  Guilty and guiltless find an equal Fate  And one vast Ruin whelm th'  Olympian  State  Cease then thy Offspring's Death unjust to call  Heroes as great have dy'd and yet shall fall  Why should Heav'n's Law with foolish Man comply  Exempted from the Race ordain'd to die  This Menace fix'd the Warrior to his Throne  Sullen he sate and curb'd the rising Groan  Then  Juno  call'd  Jove  's Orders to obey  The winged  Iris  and the God of Day  Go wait the Thund'rer's Will  Saturnia  cry'd  On yon' tall Summit of the fountful  Ide  There in the Father's awful Presence stand  Receive and execute his dread Command  She said and sate the God that gilds the Day  And various  Iris  wing their airy way  Swift as the Wind to  Ida  's Hills they came  Fair Nurse of Fountains and of savage Game  There sate th' Eternal He whose Nod controuls  The trembling World and shakes the steady Poles  Veil'd in a Mist of Fragrance him they found  With Clouds of Gold and Purple circled round  Wellpleas'd the Thund'rer saw their earnest care  And prompt Obedience to the Queen of Air  Then while a Smile serenes his awful Brow  Commands the Goddess of the show'ry Bow  Iris  descend and what we here ordain  Report to yon' mad Tyrant of the Main  Bid him from Fight to his own Deeps repair  Or breathe from Slaughter in the Fields of Air  If he refuse then let him timely weigh  Our elder Birthright and superior Sway  How shall his Rashness stand the dire Alarms  If Heav'ns Omnipotence descend in Arms  Strives he with me by whom his Pow'r was giv'n  And is there Equal to the Lord of Heav'n  Th' Almighty spoke the Goddess wing'd her Flight  To sacred  Ilion  from th'  Idaean  Height  Swift as the rat'ling Hail or fleecy Snows  Drive thro' the Skies when  Boreas  fiercely blows  So from the Clouds descending  Iris  falls  And to blue  Neptune  thus the Goddess calls  Attend the Mandate of the Sire above  In me behold the Messenger of  Jove  He bids thee from forbidden Wars repair  To thy own Deeps or to the Fields of Air  This if refus'd he bids thee timely weigh  His elder Birthright and superior Sway  How shall thy Rashness stand the dire Alarms  If Heav'ns Omnipotence descend in Arms  Striv'st thou with him by whom all Pow'r is giv'n  And art thou Equal to the Lord of Heav'n  What means the haughty Sov'reign of the Skies  The King of Ocean thus incens'd replies  Rule as he will his portion'd Realms on high  No Vassal God nor of his Train am I  Three Brother Deities from  Saturn  came  And ancient  Rhea  Earth's immortal Dame  Assign'd by Lot our triple Rule we know  Infernal  Pluto  sways the Shades below  O'er the wide Clouds and o'er the starry Plain  Ethereal  Jove  extends his high Domain  My Court beneath the hoary Waves I keep  And hush the Roarings of the sacred Deep  Olympus  and this Earth in common lie  What Claim has here the Tyrant of the Sky  Far in the distant Clouds let him controul  And awe the younger Brothers of the Pole  There to his Children his Commands be giv'n  The trembling servile second Race of Heav'n  And must I then said she O Sire of Floods  Bear this fierce Answer to the King of Gods  Correct it yet and change thy rash Intent  A noble Mind disdains not to repent  To elder Brothers guardian Fiends are giv'n  To scourage the Wretch insulting them and Heav'n  Great is the Profit thus the God rejoin'd  When Ministers are blest with prudent Mind  Warn'd by thy Words to pow'rful  Jove  I yield  And quit tho' angry the contended Field  Not but his Threats with Justice I disclaim  The same our Honours and our Birth the same  If yet forgetful of his Promise giv'n  To  Hermes Pallas  and the Queen of Heav'n  To favour  Ilion  that perfidious Place  He breaks his Faith with half th' ethereal Race  Give him to know unless the  Grecian  Train  Lay yon' proud Structures level with the Plain  Howe'er th' Offence by other Gods be past  The Wrath of  Neptune  shall for ever last  Thus speaking furious from the Field he strode  And plung'd into the Bosom of the Flood  The Lord of Thunders from his lofty Height  Beheld and thus bespoke the Source of Light  Behold the God whose liquid Arms are hurl'd  Around the Globe whose Earthquakes rock the World  Desists at length his Rebelwar to wage  Seeks his own Seas and trembles at our Rage  Else had my Wrath Heav'ns Thronesall shaking round  Burn'd to the bottom of his Seas profound  And all the Gods that round old  Saturn  dwell  Had heard the Thunders to the Deeps of Hell  Well was the Crime and well the Vengeance spar'd  Ev'n Pow'r immense had found such Battel hard  Go thou my Son the trembling  Greeks  alarm  Shake my broad  Aegis  on thy active Arm  Be godlike  Hector  thy peculiar Care  Swell his bold Heart and urge his Strength to War  Let  Ilion  conquer till th'  Achaian  Train  Fly to their Ships and  Hellespont  again  Then  Greece  shall breathe from ToilsThe Godhead said  His Will divine the Son of  Jove  obey'd  Not half so swift the sailing Falcon flies  That drives a Turtle thro' the liquid Skies  As  Phoebus  shooting from th'  Idaean  Brow  Glides down the Mountain to the Plain below  There  Hector  seated by the Stream he sees  His Sense returning with the coming Breeze  Again his Pulses beat his Spirits rise  Again his lov'd Companions meet his Eyes  Jove  thinking of his Pains they past away  To whom the God who gives the golden Day  Why sits great  Hector  from the Field so far  What grief what wound withholds him from the War  The fainting Hero as the Vision bright  Stood shining o'er him half unseal'd his Sight  What blest Immortal with commanding Breath  Thus wakens  Hector  from the Sleep of Death  Has Fame not told how while my trusty Sword  Bath'd  Greece  in Slaughter and her Battel gor'd  The mighty  Ajax  with a deadly Blow  Had almost sunk me to the Shades below  Ev'n yet methinks the gliding Ghosts I spy  And Hell's black Horrors swim before my Eye  To him  Apollo  Be no more dismay'd  See and be strong the Thund'rer sends thee Aid  Behold thy  Phoebus  shall his Arms employ  Phoebus  propitious still to thee and  Troy  Inspire thy Warriors then with manly Force  And to the Ships impell thy rapid Horse  Ev'n I will make thy fiery Coursers way  And drive the  Grecians  headlong to the Sea  Thus to bold  Hector  spoke the Son of  Jove  And breath'd immortal Ardour from above  As when the pamper'd Steed with Reins unbound  Breaks from his Stall and pours along the Ground  With ample Strokes he rushes to the Flood  To bathe his Sides and cool his fiery Blood  His Head now freed he tosses to the Skies  His Mane dishevel'd o'er his Shoulders flies  He snuffs the Females in the well known Plain  And springs exulting to his Fields again  Urg'd by the Voice divine thus  Hector  flew  Full of the God and all his Hosts pursue  As when the Force of Men and Dogs combin'd  Invade the Mountain Goat or branching Hind  They gain th'impervious Rock and safe retreat  For  Fate  preserves them from the Hunter's Threat  When lo a Lyon shoots across the way  They fly at once the Chasers and the Prey  So  Greece  that late in conq'ring Troops pursu'd  And mark'd their Progress thro' the Ranks in Blood  Soon as they see the furious Chief appear  Forget to vanquish and consent to fear  Thoas  with Grief observ'd his dreadful Course  Thoas  the bravest of th'  Aetolian  Force  Skill'd to direct the Javelin's distant Flight  And bold to combate in the standing Fight  Nor more in Councils fam'd for solid Sense  Than winning Words and heav'nly Eloquence  Gods what Portent he cry'd these Eyes invades  Lo  Hector  rises from the  Stygian  Shades  We saw him late by thund'ring  Ajax  kill'd  What God restores him to the frighted Field  And not content that half of  Greece  lie slain  Pours new Destruction on her Sons again  He comes not  Jove  without thy pow'rful Will  Lo still he lives pursues and conquers still  Yet hear my Counsel and his worst withstand  The  Greek  's main Body to the Fleet command  But let the few whom brisker Spirits warm  Stand the first Onset and provoke the Storm  Thus point your Arms and when such Foes appear  Fierce as he is let  Hector  learn to fear  The Warrior spoke the list'ning  Greeks  obey  Thick'ning their Ranks and form a deep Array  Each  Ajax Teucer Merion  gave command  The valiant Leader of the  Cretan  Band  And  Mars  like  Meges  These the Chiefs excite  Approach the Foe and meet the coming Fight  Behind unnumber'd Multitudes attend  To flank the Navy and the Shores defend  Full on the Front the pressing  Trojans  bear  And  Hector  first came tow'ring to the War  Phoebus  himself the rushing Battel led  A Veil of Clouds involv'd his radiant Head  Highheld before him  Jove  's enormous Shield  Portentous shone and shaded all the Field  Vulcan  to  Jove  th' immortal Gift consign'd  To scatter Hosts and terrify Mankind  The  Greeks  expect the Shock the Clamours rise  From diff'rent parts and mingle in the Skies  Dire was the Hiss of Darts by Heroes flung  And Arrows leaping from the Bowstring sung  These drink the Life of gen'rous Warriors slain  Those guiltless fall and thirst for Blood in vain  As long as  Phoebus  bore unmov'd the Shield  Sate doubtful Conquest hov'ring o'er the Field  But when aloft he shakes it in the Skies  Shouts in their Ears and lightens in their Eyes  Deep Horror seizes ev'ry  Grecian  Breast  Their Force is humbled and their Fear confest  So flies a Herd of Oxen scatter'd wide  No Swain to guard 'em and no Day to guide  When two fell Lyons from the Mountain come  And spread the Carnage thro' the shady Gloom  Impending  Phoebus  pours around 'em Fear  And  Troy  and  Hector  thunder in the Rear  Heaps fall on Heaps the Slaughter  Hector  leads  First great  Arcesilas  then  Stichius  bleeds  One to the bold  Boeotians  ever dear  And one  Menestheus'  Friend and fam'd Compeer  Medon  and  Iäsus Aeneas  sped  This sprung from  Phelus  and th'  Athenians  led  But hapless  Medon  from  Oïleus  came  Him  Ajax  honour'd with a Brother's Name  Tho' born of lawless Love From home expell'd  A banish'd Man in  Phylace  he dwell'd  Press'd by the Vengeance of an angry Wife  Troy  ends at last his Labours and his Life  Mecistes  next  Polydamas  o'erthrew  And thee brave  Clonius  great  Agenor  slew  By  Paris Deiochus  inglorious dies  Pierc'd thro' the Shoulder as he basely flies  Polites'  Arm laid  Echius  on the Plain  Stretch'd on one Heap the Victors spoil the slain  The  Greeks  dismay'd confus'd disperse or fall  Some seek the Trench some skulk behind the Wall  While these fly trembling others pant for Breath  And o'er the Slaughter stalks gigantic Death  On rush'd bold  Hector  gloomy as the Night  Forbids to plunder animates the Fight  Points to the Fleet For by the Gods who flies  Who dares but linger by this Hand he dies  No weeping Sister his cold Eye shall close  No friendly Hand his fun'ral Pyre compose  Who stops to plunder in this signal Hour  The Birds shall tear him and the Dogs devour  Furious he said the smarting Scourge resounds  The Coursers fly the smoaking Chariot bounds  The Hosts rush on loud Clamours shake the Shore  The Horses thunder Earth and Ocean roar  Apollo  planted at the Trenche's Bound  Push'd at the Bank Down sunk th' enormous Mound  Roll'd in the Ditch the heapy Ruin lay  A sudden Road a long and ample way  O'er the dread Fosse a lateimpervious Space  Now Steeds and Men and Cars tumultuous pass  The wond'ring Crowds the downward Level trod  Before them flam'd the Shield and march'd the God  Then with his Hand he shook the mighty Wall  And lo the Turrets nod the Bulwarks fall  Easy as when ashore an Infant stands  And draws imagin'd Houses in the Sands  The sportive Wanton pleas'd with some new Play  Sweeps the slight Works and fashion'd Domes away  Thus vanish at thy touch the Tow'rs and Walls  The Toil of thousands in a Moment falls  The  Grecians  gaze around with wild Despair  Confus'd and weary all the Pow'rs with Pray'r  Exhort their Men with Praises Threats Commands  And urge the Gods with Voices Eyes and Hands  Experienc'd  Nestor  chief obtests the Skies  And weeps his Country with a Father's Eyes  O  Jove  if ever on his native Shore  One  Greek  enrich'd thy Shrine with offer'd Gore  If e'er in hope our Country to behold  We paid the fattest Firstlings of the Fold  If e'er thou sign'st our Wishes with thy Nod  Perform the Promise of a gracious God  This Day preserve our Navies from the Flame  And save the Reliques of the  Grecian  Name  Thus pray'd the Sage Th' Eternal gave consent  And Peals of Thunder shook the Firmament  Presumptuous  Troy  mistook th' accepting Sign  And catch'd new Fury at the Voice divine  As when black Tempests mix the Seas and Skies  The roaring Deeps in watry Mountains rise  Above the sides of some tall Ship ascend  Its Womb they deluge and its Ribs they rend  Thus loudly roaring and o'erpow'ring all  Mount the thick  Trojans  up the  Grecian  Wall  Legions on Legions from each side arise  Thick sound the Keels the Storm of Arrows flies  Fierce on the Ships above the Cars below  These wield the Mace and those the Javelin throw  While thus the Thunder of the Battel rag'd  And lab'ring Armies round the Works engag'd  Still in the Tent  Patroclus  sate to tend  The good  Eurypylus  his wounded Friend  He sprinkles healing Balmes to Anguish kind  And adds Discourse the Med'cine of the Mind  But when he saw ascending up the Fleet  Victorious  Troy  Then starting from his Seat  With bitter Groans his Sorrows he exprest  He wrings his Hands he beats his manly Breast  Tho' yet thy State require Redress he cries  Depart I must What Horrors strike my Eyes  Charg'd with  Achilles'  high Commands I go  A mournful Witness of this Scene of Woe  I haste to urge him by his Country's Care  To rise in Arms and shine again in War  Perhaps some fav'ring God his Soul may bend  The Voice is pow'rful of a faithful Friend  He spoke and speaking swifter than the Wind  Sprung from the Tent and left the War behind  Th' embody'd  Greeks  the fierce Attack sustain  But strive tho' num'rous to repulse in vain  Nor could the  Trojans  thro' that firm Array  Force to the Fleet and Tents th' impervious way  As when a Shipwright with  Palladian  Art  Smooths the rough Wood and levels ev'ry Part  With equal Hand he guides his whole Design  By the just Rule and the directing Line  The martial Leaders with like Skill and Care  Preserv'd their Line and equal kept the War  Brave Deeds of Arms thro' all the Ranks were try'd  And ev'ry Ship sustain'd an equal Tyde  At one proud Bark hightow'ring o'er the Fleet  Ajax  the Great and Godlike  Hector  meet  For one bright Prize the matchless Chiefs contend  Nor this the Ships can fire nor that defend  One kept the Shore and one the Vessel trod  That fix'd as Fate this acted by a God  The Son of  Clytius  in his daring Hand  The Deck approaching shakes a flaming Brand  But pierc'd by  Telamon  's huge Lance expires  Thund'ring he falls and drops th' extinguish'd Fires  Great  Hector  view'd him with a sad Survey  As stretch'd in Dust before the Stern he lay  Oh all of  Trojan  all of  Lycian  Race  Stand to your Arms maintain this arduous Space  Lo where the Son of Royal  Clytius  lies  Ah save his Arms secure his Obsequies  This said his eager Javelin sought the Foe  But  Ajax  shunn'd the meditated Blow  Not vainly yet the forceful Lance was thrown  It stretch'd in Dust unhappy  Lycophron  An Exile long sustain'd at  Ajax'  Board  A faithful Servant to a foreign Lord  In Peace in War for ever at his side  Near his lov'd Master as he liv'd he dy'd  From the high Poop he tumbles on the Sand  And lies a lifeless Load along the Land  With Anguish  Ajax  views the piercing Sight  And thus inflames his Brother to the Fight  Teucer  behold extended on the Shore  Our Friend our lov'd Companion now no more  Dear as a Parent with a Parent's Care  To fight our Wars he left his native Air  This Death deplor'd to  Hector  's Rage we owe  Revenge revenge it on the cruel Foe  Where are those Darts on which the Fates attend  And where the Bow which  Phoebus  taught to bend  Impatient  Teucer  hastening to his Aid  Before the Chief his ample Bow display'd  The wellstor'd Quiver on his Shoulders hung  Then hiss'd his Arrow and the Bowstring sung  Clytus Pisenor  's Son renown'd in Fame  To thee  Polydamas  an honour'd Name  Drove thro' the thickest of th' embattel'd Plains  The startling Steeds and shook his eager Reins  As all on Glory ran his ardent Mind  The pointed Death arrests him from behind  Thro' his fair Neck the thrilling Arrow flies  In Youth's first Bloom reluctantly he dies  Hurl'd from the lofty Seat at distance far  The headlong Coursers spurn his empty Car  Till sad  Polydamas  the Steeds restrain'd  And gave  Astynous  to thy careful Hand  Then fir'd to Vengeance rush'd amidst the Foe  Rage edg'd his Sword and strengthen'd ev'ry Blow  Once more bold  Teucer  in his Country's Cause  At  Hector  's Breast a chosen Arrow draws  And had the Weapon found the destin'd way  Thy Fall great  Trojan  had renown'd that Day  But  Hector  was not doom'd to perish then  Th' allwise Disposer of the Fates of Men  Imperial  Jove  his present Death withstands  Nor was such Glory due to  Teucer  's Hands  At his full Stretch as the tough String he drew  Struck by an Arm unseen it burst in two  Down drop'd the Bow the Shaft with brazen Head  Fell innocent and on the Dust lay dead  Th' astonish'd Archer to great  Ajax  cries  Some God prevents our destin'd Enterprize  Some God propitious to the  Trojan  Foe  Has from my Arm unfailing struck the Bow  And broke the Nerve my Hands had twin'd with Art  Strong to impell the Flight of many a Dart  Since Heav'n commands it  Ajax  made reply  Dismiss the Bow and lay thy Arrows by  Thy Arms no less suffice the Lance to wield  And quit the Quiver for the pond'rous Shield  In the first Ranks indulge thy Thirst of Fame  Thy brave Example shall the rest enflame  Fierce as they are by long Successes vain  To force our Fleet or ev'n a Ship to gain  Asks Toil and Sweat and Blood Their utmost Might  Shall find its MatchNo more 'Tis ours to fight  Then  Teucer  laid his faithless Bow aside  The fourfold Buckler o'er his Shoulder ty'd  On his brave Head a crested Helm he plac'd  With nodding Horsehair formidably grac'd  A Dart whose Point with Brass refulgent shines  The Warrior wields and his great Brother joins  This  Hector  saw and thus express'd his Joy  Ye Troops of  Lycia Dardanus  and  Troy  Be mindful of your selves your ancient Fame  And spread your Glory with the Navy's Flame  Jove  is with us I saw his Hand but now  From the proud Archer strike his vaunted Bow  Indulgent  Jove  how plain thy Favours shine  When happy Nations bear the Marks divine  How easy then to see the sinking State  Of Realms accurs'd deserted reprobate  Such is the Fate of  Greece  and such is ours  Behold ye Warriors and exert your Pow'rs  Death is the worst a Fate which all must try  And for our Country 'tis a Bliss to die  The gallant Man tho' slain in Fight he be  Yet leaves his Nation safe his Children free  Entails a Debt on all the grateful State  His own brave Friends shall glory in his Fate  His Wife live honour'd all his Race succeed  And late Posterity enjoy the Deed  This rouz'd the Soul in ev'ry  Trojan  Breast  The godlike  Ajax  next his  Greeks  addrest  How long ye Warriors of the  Argive  Race  To gen'rous  Argos  what a dire Disgrace  How long on these curs'd Confines will ye lie  Yet undetermin'd or to live or die  What Hopes remain what Methods to retire  If once your Vessels catch the  Trojan  Fire  Mark how the Flames approach how near they fall  How  Hector  calls and  Troy  obeys his Call  Not to the Dance that dreadful Voice invites  It calls to Death and all the Rage of Fights  'Tis now no time for Wisdom or Debates  To your own Hands are trusted all your Fates  And better far in one decisive Strife  One Day should end our Labour or our Life  Than keep this hardgot Inch of barren Sands  Still press'd and press'd by such inglorious Hands  The list'ning  Grecians  feel their Leader's Flame  And ev'ry kindling Bosom pants for Fame  Then mutual Slaughters spread on either side  By  Hector  here the  Phocian Schedius  dy'd  There pierc'd by  Ajax  sunk  Laodamas  Chief of the Foot of old  Antenor  's Race  Polydamas  laid  Otus  on the Sand  The fierce Commander of th'  Epeian  Band  His Lance bold  Meges  at the Victor threw  The Victor stooping from the Death withdrew  That valu'd Life O  Phoebus  was thy Care  But  Croesmus'  Bosom took the flying Spear  His Corps fell bleeding on the slipp'ry Shore  His radiant Arms triumphant  Meges  bore  Dolops  the Son of  Lampus  rushes on  Sprung from the Race of old  Laomedon  And fam'd for Prowess in a wellfought Field  He pierc'd the Centre of his sounding Shield  But  Meges Phyleus'  ample Breastplate wore  Well known in Fight on  Selles'  winding Shore  For King  Euphetes  gave the golden Mail  Compact and firm with many a jointed Scale  Which oft in Cities storm'd and Battels won  Had sav'd the Father and now saves the Son  Full at the  Trojan  's Head he urg'd his Lance  Where the high Plumes above the Helmet dance  Newting'd with  Tyrian  Dye In Dust below  Shorn from the Crest the purple Honours glow  Meantime their Fight the  Spartan  King survey'd  And stood by  Meges'  side a sudden Aid  Thro'  Dolops'  Shoulder urg'd his forceful Dart  Which held its Passage thro' the panting Heart  And issu'd at his Breast With thund'ring Sound  The Warrior falls extended on the Ground  In rush the conqu'ring  Greeks  to spoil the slain  But  Hector  's Voice excites his kindred Train  The Hero most from  Hicetaon  sprung  Fierce  Melanippus  gallant brave and young  He e'er to  Troy  the  Grecians  cross'd the Main  Fed his large Oxen on  Percote  's Plain  But when oppress'd his Country claim'd his Care  Return'd to  Ilion  and excell'd in War  For this in  Priam  's Court he held his Place  Belov'd no less than  Priam  's Royal Race  Him  Hector  singled as his Troops he led  And thus inflam'd him pointing to the Dead  Lo  Melanippus  lo where  Dolops  lies  And is it thus our Royal Kinsman dies  O'ermatch'd he falls to two at once a Prey  And lo they bear the bloody Arms away  Come ona distant War no longer wage  But hand to hand thy Country's Foes engage  Till  Greece  at once and all her Glory end  Or  Ilion  from her tow'ry Height descend  Heav'd from the lowest Stone and bury All  In one sad Sepulchre one common Fall  Hector  this said rush'd forward on the Foes  With equal Ardour  Melanippus  glows  Then  Ajax  thusOh  Greeks  respect your Fame  Respect your selves and learn an honest Shame  Let mutual Reverence mutual Warmth inspire  And catch from Breast to Breast the noble Fire  On Valour's side the odds of Combate lie  The brave live glorious or lamented die  The Wretch that trembles in the Field of Fame  Meets Death and worse than Death eternal Shame  His gen'rous Sense he not in vain imparts  It sunk and rooted in the  Grecian  Hearts  They join they throng they thicken at his Call  And flank the Navy with a brazen Wall  Shields touching Shields in order blaze above  And stop the  Trojans  tho' impell'd by  Jove  The fiery  Spartan  first with loud Applause  Warms the bold Son of  Nestor  in his Cause  Is there he said in Arms a Youth like you  So strong to fight so active to pursue  Why stand you distant nor attempt a Deed  Lift the bold Lance and make some  Trojan  bleed  He said and backward to the Lines retir'd  Forth rush'd the Youth with martial Fury fir'd  Beyond the foremost Ranks his Lance he threw  And round the black Battalions cast his View  The Troops of  Troy  recede with sudden Fear  While the swift Javelin hiss'd along in Air  Advancing  Menalippus  met the Dart  With his bold Breast and felt it in his Heart  Thund'ring he falls his falling Arms resound  And his broad Buckler rings against the Ground  The Victor leaps upon his prostrate Prize  Thus on a Roe the wellbreath'd Beagle flies  And rends his side freshbleeding with the Dart  The distant Hunter sent into his Heart  Observing  Hector  to the Rescue flew  Bold as he was  Antilochus  withdrew  So when a Savage ranging o'er the Plain  Has torn the Shepherd's Dog or Shepherd Swain  While conscious of the Deed he glares around  And hears the gath'ring Multitude resound  Timely he flies the yetuntasted Food  And gains the friendly Shelter of the Wood  So fears the Youth all  Troy  with Shouts pursue  While Stones and Darts in mingled Tempest flew  But enter'd in the  Grecian  Ranks he turns  His manly Breast and with new Fury burns  Now on the Fleet the Tydes of  Trojans  drove  Fierce to fulfill the stern Decrees of  Jove  The Sire of Gods confirming  Thetis'  Pray'r  The  Grecian  Ardour quench'd in deep Despair  But lifts to Glory  Troy  's prevailing Bands  Swells all their Hearts and strengthens all their Hands  On  Ida  's Top he waits with longing Eyes  To view the Navy blazing to the Skies  Then nor till then the Scale of War shall turn  The  Trojans  fly and conquer'd  Ilion  burn  These Fates revolv'd in his almighty Mind  He raises  Hector  to the Work design'd  Bids him with more than mortal Fury glow  And drives him like a Light'ning on the Foe  So  Mars  when human Crimes for Vengeance call  Shakes his huge Javelin and whole Armies fall  Not with more Rage a Conflagration rolls  Wraps the vast Mountains and involves the Poles  He foames with Wrath beneath his gloomy Brow  Like fiery Meteors his red Eyeballs glow  The radiant Helmet on his Temples burns  Waves when he nods and lightens as he turns  For  Jove  his Splendour round the Chief had thrown  And cast the Blaze of both the Hosts on one  Unhappy Glories for his Fate was near  Due to stern  Pallas  and  Pelides'  Spear  Yet  Jove  deferr'd the Death he was to pay  And gave what Fate allow'd the Honours of a Day  Now all on fire for Fame his Breast his Eyes  Burn at each Foe and single ev'ry Prize  Still at the closest Ranks the thickest Fight  He points his Ardour and exerts his Might  The  Grecian  Phalanx moveless as a Tow'r  On all sides batter'd yet resists his Pow'r  So some tall Rock o'erhangs the hoary Main  By Winds assail'd by Billows beat in vain  Unmov'd it hears above the Tempest blow  And sees the watry Mountains break below  Girt in surrounding Flames he seems to fall  Like Fire from  Jove  and bursts upon them all  Bursts as a Wave that from the Clouds impends  And swell'd with Tempests on the Ship descends  White are the Decks with Foam the Winds aloud  Howl o'er the Masts and sing thro' ev'ry Shroud  Pale trembling tir'd the Sailors freeze with Fears  And instant Death on ev'ry Wave appears  So pale the  Greeks  the Eyes of  Hector  meet  The Chief so thunders and so shakes the Fleet  As when a Lion rushing from his Den  Amidst the Plain of some widewater'd Fen  Where num'rous Oxen as at ease they feed  At large expatiate o'er the ranker Mead  Leaps on the Herds before the Herdsman's Eyes  The trembling Herdsman far to distance flies  Some lordly Bull the rest dispers'd and fled  He singles out arrests and lays him dead  Thus from the Rage of  Jove  like  Hector  flew  All  Greece  in Heaps but one he seiz'd and slew  Mycenian Periphes  a mighty Name  In Wisdom great in Arms well known to Fame  The Minister of stern  Euristheus'  Ire  Against  Alcides Copreus  was his Sire  The Son redeem'd the Honours of the Race  A Son as gen'rous as his Sire was base  O'er all his Country's Youth conspicuous far  In ev'ry Virtue or of Peace or War  But doom'd to  Hector  's stronger Force to yield  Against the Margin of his ample Shield  He struck his hasty Foot his Heels upsprung  Supine he fell his brazen Helmet rung  On the fall'n Chief th' invading  Trojan  prest  And plung'd the pointed Javelin in his Breast  His circling Friends who strove to guard too late  Th' unhappy Hero fled or shar'd his Fate  Chas'd from the foremost Line the  Grecian  Train  Now man the next receding tow'rd the Main  Wedg'd in one

Resentment natural to a Superior who is imposed upon by one of less Worth and Sense than himself and imposed upon in the worst manner by Shews of Tenderness and Love  II  VERSE  Hast thou forgot  c  It is in the Original to this Effect  Have you forgot how you swung in the Air when I hung a Load of two Anvils at your Feet and a Chain of Gold on your Hands  "Tho' it is not my Design says M  Dacier  to give a Reason for every Story in the Pagan Theology yet I can't prevail upon my self to pass over this in Silence The physical Allegory seems very apparent to me  Homer  mysteriously in this Place explains the Nature of the  Air which is  Juno  the two Anvils which she had at her Feet are the two Elements Earth and Water and the Chains of Gold about her Hands are the  Aether  or Fire which fills the superior Region The two grosser Elements are called Anvils to shew us that in these two Elements only Arts are exercis'd I don't know but that a moral Allegory may here be found as well as a physical one the Poet by these Masses tied to the Feet of  Juno  and by the Chain of Gold with which her Hands were bound might signify that on one side domestick Affairs should like Fetters detain the wise at home and on the other that proper and beautiful Works like Chains of Gold ought to employ her Hands"  The physical part of this Note belongs to  Heraclides Pontius Eustathius  and the Scholiast M  Dacier  might have been contented with the Credit of the moral one as it seems an Observation no less singular in a Lady  III  VERSE  Eustathius  tells us that there were in some Manuscripts of  Homer  two Verses which are not to be found in any of the printed Editions which  Hen Stephens  places here  By these two Verses  Homer  shews us that what he says of the Punishment of  Juno  was not an Invention of his own but founded upon an ancient Tradition There had probably been some Statue of  Juno  with Anvils at her Feet and Chains on her Hands and nothing but Chains and Anvils being left by Time superstitious People rais'd this Story so that  Homer  only follow'd common Report What farther confirms it is what  Eustathius  adds that there were shewn near  Troy  certain Ruins which were said to be the Remains of these Masses  Dacier  IV  VERSE  And thy black Waves tremendous  Styx  The Epithet  Homer  here gives to  Styx  is    subterlabens  which I take to refer to its Passage thro' the infernal Regions But there is a Refinement upon it as if it signify'd  ex alto stillans  falling drop by drop from on high  Herodotus  in his sixth Book writes thus  "The  Arcadians  say that near the City  Nonacris  flows the Water of  Styx  and that it is a small Rill which distilling from an exceeding high Rock falls into a little Cavity or Bason environ'd with a Hedge"  Pausanias  who had seen the Place gives Light to this Passage of  Herodotus  "Going from  Phereus  says he in the Country of the  Arcadians  and drawing towards the West we find on the left the City  Clytorus  and on the right that of  Nonacris  and the Fountain of  Styx  which from the Height of a shaggy Precipiece falls drop by drop upon an exceeding high Rock and before it has travers'd this Rock flows into the River  Crathis  this Water is mortal both to Man and Beast and therefore it is said to be an infernal Fountain  Homer  gives it a Place in his Poems and by the Description which he delivers one would think he had seen it"  This shews the wonderful Exactness of  Homer  in the Description of Places which he mentions The Gods swore by  Styx  and this was the strongest Oath they could take but we likewise find that Men too swore by this fatal Water for  Herodotus  tells us that  Cleomenes  going to  Arcadia  to engage the  Arcadians  to follow him in a War against  Sparta  had a design to assemble at the City  Nonacris  and make them swear by the Water of this Fountain  Dacier Eustath  in  Odyss  V  VERSE  Not by my Arts  c  This Apology is well contriv'd  Juno  could not swear that she had not deceiv'd  Jupiter  for this had been entirely false and  Homer  would  be far from authorizing Perjury by so great an Example  Juno  we see throws part of the Fault on  Neptune  by shewing she had not acted in concert with him  Eustathius  VI  VERSE Greece  chas'd by  Troy c  In this Discourse of  Jupiter  the Poet opens his Design by giving his Readers a Sketch of the principal Events he is to expect As this Conduct of  Homer  may to many appear no way artful and since it is a principal Article of the Charge brought against him by some late  French  Criticks it will not be improper here to look a little into this Dispute The Case will be best stated by translating the following Passage from Mr  de la Motte  's  Reflections sur la Critique  "I could not forbear wishing that  Homer  had an Art which he seems to have neglected that of preparing Events without making them known beforehand so that when they happen one might be surprized agreeably I could not be quite satisfied to hear  Jupiter  in the middle of the Iliad give an exact Abridgment of the Remainder of the Action Mad  Dacier  alledges as an Excuse that this past only between  Jupiter  and  Juno  as if the Reader was not let into the Secret and had not as much share in the Confidence  She adds  "that as we are capable of a great deal of Pleasure at the Representation of a Tragedy which we have seen before so the Surprizes which I require are no way necessary to our Entertainment This I think a pure Piece of Sophistry One may have two sorts of Pleasure at the Representation of a Tragedy in the first place that of taking part in an Action of Importance the first time it passes before our Eyes of being agitated by Fear and Hope for the Persons one is most concern'd about and in fine of partaking their Felicity or Misfortune as they happen to succeed or be disappointed  "This therefore is the first Pleasure which the Poet should design to give his Auditors to transport them by pathetic  Surprizes which excite Terror or Pity The second Pleasure must proceed from a View of that Art which the Author has shewn in raising the former  "'Tis true when we have seen a Piece already we have no longer that first Pleasure of the Surprize at least not in all its Vivacity but there still remains the second which could never have its turn had not the Poet labour'd successfully to excite the first it being upon that indispensable Obligation that we judge of his Art  "The Art therefore consists in telling the Hearer only what is necessary to be told him and in telling him only as much as is requisite to the Design of pleasing him And altho' we know this already when we read it a second time we yet taste the Pleasure of that Order and Conduct which the Art required  "From hence it follows that every Poem ought to be contrived for the first Impression it is to make If it be otherwise it gives us instead of two Pleasures which we expected two sorts of Disgusts the one that of being cool and untouch'd when we should be mov'd and transported the other that of perceiving the Defect which caus'd that Disgust  "This in one word is what I have found in the Iliad I was not interested or touch'd by the Adventures and I saw it was this cooling Preparation that prevented my being so"  It appears clearly that M  Dacier  's Defence no way excuses the Poet's Conduct wherefore I shall add two or three Considerations which may chance to set it in a better Light It must be own'd that a Surprize artfully managed which arises from unexpected Revolutions of great Actions affects the Mind with a peculiar Delight In this consists the principal Pleasure of a Romance and well writ Tragedy But besides this there is in the Relation of great Events a different kind of Pleasure which arises from the artful unravelling a Knot of Actions which we knew before in the gross This is a Delight peculiar to History and Epic Poetry which is founded on History In these kinds of writing a preceding summary Knowledge of the Events described does no way  damp our Curiosity but rather makes it more eager for the Detail This is evident in a good History where generally the Reader is affected with a greater Delight in proportion to his preceding Knowledge of the Facts described The Pleasure in this case is like that of an Architect first viewing some magnificent Building who was before well acquainted with the Proportions of it In an Epic Poem the case is of a like Nature where as if the historical Foreknowledge were not sufficient the most judicious Poets never fail to excite their Reader's Curiosity by some small Sketches of their Design which like the Outlines of a fine Picture will necessarily raise in us a greater desire to see it in its finish'd Colouring  Had our Author been inclined to follow the Method of managing our Passions by Surprizes he could not well have succeeded by this manner in the Subject he chose to write upon which being a Story of great Importance the principal Events of which were well known to the  Greeks  it was not possible for him to alter the Groundwork of his Piece and probably he was willing to mark by these Recapitulations how much of his Story was founded on historical Truths and that what is superadded were the poetical Ornaments  There is another Consideration worth remembring on this Head to justify our Author's Conduct It seems to have been an Opinion in these early times deeply rooted in most Countries and Religions that the Actions of Men were not only foreknown but predestinated by a superior Being This Sentiment is very frequent in the most ancient Writers both sacred and prophane and seems a distinguishing Character of the Writings of the greatest Antiquity  The Word of the Lord was fulfill'd  is the principal Observation in the History of the Old Testament and  is the declared and most obvious Moral of the Iliad If this great Moral be fit to be represented in Poetry what Means so proper to make it evident as this introducing  Jupiter  foretelling the Events which he had decreed  VII  VERSE  As some wayfaring Man  c  The Discourse of  Jupiter  to  Juno  being ended she ascends to Heaven with wonderful Celerity which the Poet explains by this Comparison On other Occasions he has illustrated the Action of the Mind by sensible Images from the Motion of the Bodies here he inverts the Case and shews the great Velocity of  Juno  's Flight by comparing it to the Quickness of Thought No other Comparison could have equall'd the Speed of an heavenly Being To render this more beautiful and exact the Poet describes a Traveller who revolves in his Mind the several Places which he has seen and in an Instant passes in Imagination from one distant Part of the Earth to another  Milton  seems to have had it in his Eye in that elevated Passage  The Speed of Gods  Time counts not tho' with swiftest Minutes wing'd  As the Sense in which we have explain'd this Passage is exactly literal as well as truly sublime one cannot but wonder what should induce both  Hobbes  and  Chapman  to ramble so wide from it in their Translations  This said went  Juno  to  Olympus  high  As when a Man looks o'er an ample Plain  To any distance quickly goes his Eye  So swiftly  Juno  went with little Pain  Chapman  's is yet more foreign to the Subject  But as the Mind of such a Man that hath a great way gone  And either knowing not his way or then would let alone  His purpos'd Journey is distract and in his vexed Mind  Resolves now not to go now goes still many ways inclin'd  VIII  VERSE  Go thou the Feasts of Heav'n attend thy Call    This is a Passage worthy our Observation  Homer  feigns that  Themis  that is Justice presides over the Feasts of the Gods to let us know that she ought much more to preside over the Feasts of Men  Eustathius  IX  VERSE Juno  's Speech to the Gods    It was no sort of Exaggeration what the Ancients have affirm'd of  Homer  that the Examples of all kinds of Oratory are to be found in his Works The present Speech of  Juno  is a Masterpiece in that sort which seems to say one thing and persuades another For while she is only declaring to the Gods the Orders of  Jupiter  at the time that she tells 'em they must obey she fills them with a Reluctance to do it By representing so strongly the Superiority of his Power she makes them uneasy at it and by particularly advising that God to submit whose Temper could least brook it she incites him to downright Rebellion Nothing can be more sly and artfully provoking than that Stroke on the Death of his darling Son  Do thou O  Mars  teach Obedience to us all for 'tis upon thee that  Jupiter  has put the severest Trial  Ascalaphus  thy Son lies slain by his means Bear it with so much Temper and Moderation that the World may not think he was thy Son  X  VERSE  To  Fear  and  Flight  Homer  does not say that  Mars  commanded they should join his Horses to his Chariot which Horses were call'd  Fear  and  Flight Fear  and  Flight  are not the Names of the Horses of  Mars  but the Names of two Furies in the Service of this God It appears likewise by other Passages that they were his Children  Book ℣ This is a very ancient Mistake  Eustathius  mentions it as an Error of  Antimachus  yet  Hobbes  and most others have fallen into it  XI  VERSE  Go wait the Thund'rer's Will    'Tis remarkable that whereas it is familiar with the Poet to repeat his Errands and Messages here he introduces  Juno  with very few Words where she carries a Dispatch from  Jupiter  to  Iris  and  Apollo  She only says  "  Jove  commands you to attend him on Mount  Ida  "  and adds nothing of what had pass'd between herself and her Consort before The reason of this Brevity is not only that she is highly disgusted with  Jupiter  and so unwilling to tell her Tale from the Anguish of her Heart but also because  Jupiter  had given her no Commission to relate fully the Subject of their Discourse wherefore she is cautious of declaring what possibly he would have concealed Neither does  Jupiter  himself in what follows reveal his Decrees For he lets  Apollo  only so far into his Will that he would have him discover and rout the  Greeks  Their good Fortune and the Success which was to ensue he hides from him as one who favour'd the Cause of  Troy  One may remark in this Passage  Homer  's various Conduct and Discretion concerning what ought to be put in Practice or left undone whereby his Reader may be inform'd how to regulate his own Affairs  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  Three Brother Deities from  Saturn  came  And ancient  Rhea  Earth's immortal Dame  Assign'd by Lot our Triple Rule we know  c  Some have thought the  Platonic  Philosophers drew from hence the Notion of their  Triad  which the Christian  Platonists  since imagined to be an obscure Hint of the  Sacred Trinity  The  Trias  of  Plato  is well known    In his  Gorgias  he tells us  autorem sc fuisse  See  Proclus in Plat Theol lib    c    Lucian Philopatr Aristotle de coelo l    c  speaking of the  Ternarian  Number from  Pythagoras  has these Words  From which Passage  Trapezuntius  endeavour'd very seriously to prove that  Aristotle  had a perfect Knowledge of the  Trinity Duport  who furnish'd me with this Note and who seems to be sensible of the Folly of  Trapezuntius  nevertheless in his  Gnomologia Homerica  or Comparison of our Author's Sentences with those of the Scripture has placed opposite to this Verse that of St  John There are three who give Testimony in Heaven the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost  I think this the strongest Instance I ever met with of the manner of thinking of such Men whose too much Learning has made them mad  Lactantius de Fals Relig lib    cap  takes this Fable to be a Remain of ancient History importing that the Empire of the then known World was divided among the three Brothers to  Jupiter  the Oriental part which was call'd Heaven as the Region of Light or the Sun To  Pluto  the Occidental or darker Regions And to  Neptune  the Sovereignty of the Seas  XIII  VERSE  To elder Brothers    Iris  that she may not seem to upbraid  Neptune  with Weakness of Judgment out of Regard to the Greatness and Dignity of his Person does not say that  Jupiter  is stronger or braver but attacking him from a Motive not in the least invidious Superiority of Age she says sententiously that the  Furies  wait upon our Elders The  Furies  are said to wait upon Men in a double Sense either for Evil as they did upon  Orestes  after he had slain his Mother or else for their good as upon Elders when they are injur'd to protect them and avenge their Wrongs This  is an Instance that the Pagans look'd upon Birthright as a Right divine  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Else had our Wrath  c  This Representation of the Terrors which must have attended the Conflict of two such mighty Powers as  Jupiter  and  Neptune  whereby the Elements had been mix'd in Confusion and the whole Frame of Nature endangered is imaged in these few Lines with a Nobleness suitable to the Occasion  Milton  has a Thought very like it in his fourth Book where he represents what must have happen'd if  Satan  and  Gabriel  had encounter'd  Not only  Paradise  In this Commotion but the starry Cope  Of Heav'n perhaps and all the Elements  At least had gone to wrack disturb'd and torn  With Violence of this Conflict had not soon  Th' Almighty to prevent such horrid Fray  c  XV  VERSE Jove  thinking of his Pains they past away    Eustathius  observes that this is a very sublime Representation of the Power of  Jupiter  to make  Hector  's Pains cease from the Moment wherein  Jupiter  first turn'd his Thoughts towards him  Apollo  finds him so far recover'd as to be able to sit up and know his Friends Thus much was the Work of  Jupiter  the God of Health perfects the Cure  XVI  VERSE  As when the pamper'd Steed    This Comparison is repeated from the sixth Book and we are told that the ancient Criticks retain'd no more than the two first Verses and the four last in this Place and that they gave the  Verses two Marks by the one which was the Asterism they intimated that the four Lines were very beautiful but by the other which was the  Obelus  that they were ill placed I believe an impartial Reader who considers the two Places will be of the same Opinion  Tasso  has improv'd the Justness of this Simile in his sixteenth Book where  Rinaldo  returning from the Arms of  Armida  to Battel is compared to the Steed that is taken from his Pastures and Mares to the Service of the War The Reverse of the Circumstance better agreeing with the Occasion  Qual feroce destrier ch'al faticoso  Honor de l'arme vincitor sia tolto  E lascivo marito in vil riposo  Frà gli armenti e ne'paschi erri disciolto  Se'l desta o suon di tromba o luminoso  Acciar colà tosto annittendo è volto  Già già brama l'arringo e l'huom sùl dorso  Portando urtato riurtar nel corso  XVII  VERSE  For Fate preserves them    Dacier  has a pretty Remark on this Passage that  Homer  extended Destiny that is the Care of Providence even over the Beasts of the Field an Opinion that agrees perfectly with true Theology In the Book of  Jonas  the Regard of the Creator extending to the meanest Rank of his Creatures is strongly express'd in those Words of the Almighty where he makes his Compassion to the Brute Beasts one of the Reasons against destroying  Nineveh Shall I not spare the great City in which there are more than sixscore thousand Persons and also much Cattel  And what is still more parallel to this Passage in St  Matth  Ch  Are not two Sparrows sold for a Farthing And yet one of them shall not fall to the Ground without your Father  XVIII  VERSE  But when aloft he shakes    Apollo  in this Passage by the mere shaking his  Aegis  without acting offensively annoys and puts the  Greeks  into Disorder  Eustathius  thinks that such a Motion might possibly create the same Confusion as hath been reported by Historians to proceed from  Panic Fears  or that it might intimate some dreadful Confusion in the Air and a Noise issuing from thence a Notion which seems to be warranted by  Apollo  's Outcry which presently follows in the same Verse But perhaps we need not go so far to account for this Fiction of  Homer  The Sight of a Hero's Armour often has the like Effect in an Epic Poem The Shield of Prince  Arthur  in  Spencer  works the same Wonders with this  Aegis  of  Apollo  XIX  VERSE  By  Paris Deiochus  inglorious dies  Pierc'd thro' the Shoulder as he basely flies    Here is one that falls under the Spear of  Paris  smitten in the Extremity of his Shoulder as he was flying This gives occasion to a pretty Observation in  Eustathius  that this is the only  Greek  who falls by a Wound in the Back so careful is  Homer  of the Honour of his Countrymen And this Remark will appear not ill grounded if we except the Death of  Eioneus  in the beginning of  Lib    XX  VERSE  For by the Gods who slies  c  It sometimes happens says  Longinus  that a Writer in speaking of some Person all on a sudden puts himself in that other's Place and acts his part a Figure which marks the Impetuosity and Hurry of Passion It is this which  Homer  practises in these Verses the Poet stops his Narration forgets his own Person and instantly without any Notice puts this precipitate  Menace into the Mouth of his furious and transported Hero How must his Discourse have languish'd had he stay'd to tell us Hector  then said these or the like Words  Instead of which by this unexpected Transition he prevents the Reader and the Transition is made before the Poet himself seems sensible he had made it The true and proper Place for this Figure is when the Time presses and when the Occasion will not allow of any Delay It is elegant then to pass from one Person to another as in that of  Hecataeus The Herald extremely discontented at the Orders he had receiv'd gave command to the  Heraclidae  to withdrawIt is no way in my Power to help you if therefore you would not perish entirely and if you would not involve me too in your Ruin depart and seek a Retreat among some other People  Longinus  ch    XXI  VERSE  As when ashore an Infant stands    This Simile of the Sand is inimitable it is not easy to imagine any thing more exact and emphatical to describe the tumbling and confus'd Heap of a Wall in a Moment Moreover the Comparison here taken from Sand is the juster as it rises from the very Place and Scene before us For the Wall here demolished as it was founded on the Coast must needs border on the Sand wherefore the Similitude is borrowed immediately from the Subject Matter under View  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE  Oh  Jove  if ever  c  The Form of  Nestor  's Prayer in this Place resembles that of  Chryses  in the first Book And it is worth remarking that the Poet well knew what Shame and Confusion the reminding one of past Benefits is apt to produce From the same Topick  Achilles  talks with his Mother and  Thetis  herself accosts  Jove  and likewise  Phoenix  where he holds a Parley with  Achilles  This righteous Prayer hath its wished Accomplishment  Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE  Presumptuous  Troy  mistook the Sign    The Thunder of  Jupiter  is design'd as a Mark of his Acceptance of  Nestor  's Prayers and a Sign of his Favour to the  Greeks  However there being nothing in the Prodigy particular to the  Greeks  the  Trojans  expound it in their own Favour as they seem warranted by their present Success This Selfpartiality of Men in appropriating to themselves the Protection of Heaven has always been natural to them In the same manner  Virgil  makes  Turnus  explain the Transformation of the  Trojan  Ships into Nymphs as an ill Omen to the  Trojans  Trojanos haec monstra petunt his Jupiter ipse  Auxilium solitum eripuit  History furnishes many Instances of Oracles which by reason of this partial Interpretation have prov'd an occasion to lead Men into great Misfortunes It was the Case of  Craesus  in his Wars with  Cyrus  and a like Mistake engaged  Pyrrhus  to make War upon the  Romans  XXIV  VERSE  On the Ships above the Cars below    This is a new sort of Battel which  Homer  has never before mention'd the  Greeks  on their Ships and the  Trojans  in their Chariots fight as on a Plain  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE  Nor could the  Trojans  Force to the Fleet and Tents th' impervious way    Homer  always marks distinctly the Place of Battel he here shews us clearly that the  Trojans  attack'd the first Line of the Fleet that stood next the  Wall or the Vessels which were drawn foremost on the Land These Vessels were a strong Rampart to the Tents which were pitch'd behind and to the other Line of the Navy which stood nearer to the Sea to penetrate therefore to the Tents they must necessarily force the first Line and defeat the Troops which defended it  Eustathius  XXVI  VERSE  Death is the worst  c  'Tis with very great Address that to the Bitterness of Death he adds the Advantages that were to accrue after it And the Ancients are of Opinion that 'twou'd be as advantageous for young Soldiers to read this Lesson concise as it is as all the Volumes of  Tyrtaeus  wherein he endeavours to raise the Spirits of his Countrymen  Homer  makes a noble Enumeration of the Parts wherein the Happiness of a City consists For having told us in another Place the three great Evils to which a Town when taken is subject the Slaughter of the Men the Destruction of the Place by Fire the leading of their Wives and Children into Captivity now he reckons up the Blessings that are contrary to those Calamities To the Slaughter of the Men indeed he makes no Opposition because it is not necessary to the Wellbeing of a City that every Individual should be saved and not a Man slain  Eustathius  XXVII  VERSE  The godlike  Ajax  next    The Oration of  Hector  is more splendid and shining than that of  Ajax  and also more solemn from his Sentiments concerning the Favour and Assistance of  Jupiter  But that of  Ajax  is the more politick fuller of Management and apter to persuade For it abounds with no less than seven generous Arguments to inspire Resolution He exhorts his People even to Death from the Danger to which their Navy was exposed which if once consumed they were never like to get home And as  the  Trojans  were bid to die so he bids his Men dare to die likewise and indeed with great Necessity for the  Trojans  may recruit after the Engagement but for the  Greeks  they had no better way than to hazard their Lives and if they should gain nothing else by it yet at least they would have a speedy Dispatch not a lingring and dilatory Destruction  Eustathius  XXVIII  VERSE  And flank the Navy with a Brazen Wall    The Poet has built the  Grecians  a different sort of Wall from what they had before out of their Arms and perhaps one might say that 'twas from this Passage  Apollo  borrow'd that Oracle which he gave to the  Athenians  about their Wall of Wood in like manner the  Spartans  were said to have a Wall of Bones If so we must allow the God not a little obliged to the Poet  Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE  He raises  Hector c  This Picture of  Hector  impuls'd by  Jupiter  is a very finish'd Piece and excels all the Drawings of this Hero which  Homer  has given us in so various Attitudes He is here represented as an Instrument in the Hand of  Jupiter  to bring about those Designs the God had long projected And as his fatal Hour now approaches  Jove  is willing to recompence his hasty Death with this shortliv'd Glory Accordingly this being the last Scene of Victory he is to appear in the Poet introduces him with all imaginable Pomp and adorns him with all the Terror of a Conqueror His Eyes sparkle with Fire his Mouth foams with Fury his Figure is compared to the God of War his Rage is equall'd to a Conflagration and a Storm and the Destruction he causes is resembled to that which a Lyon makes among the Herds The Poet by this Heap of Comparisons raises the Idea of the Hero higher than any single Description could reach  XXX  VERSE  His Fate was nearDue to stern  Pallas  It may be ask'd what  Pallas  has to do with the  Fates  or what Power has she over them  Homer  speaks thus because  Minerva  has already resolv'd to succour  Achilles  and deceive  Hector  in the Combate between these two Heroes as we find in Book Properly speaking  Pallas  is nothing but the Knowledge and Wisdom of  Jove  and it is Wisdom which presides over the Councels of his Providence therefore she may be look'd upon as drawing all things to the fatal Term to which they are decreed  Dacier  XXXI  VERSE  Bursts as a Wave  c  Longinus  observing that oftentimes the principal Beauty of Writing consists in the judicious assembling together of the great Circumstances and the Strength with which they are mark'd in the proper Place chuses this Passage of  Homer  as a plain Instance of it  "Where says that noble Critick in describing the Terror of a Tempest he takes care to express whatever are the Accidents of most Dread and Horror in such a Situation He is not content to tell us that the Mariners were in danger but he brings them before our Eyes as in a Picture upon the Point of being every Moment overwhelm'd by every Wave nay the very Words and Syllables of the Description give us an Image of their Peril"  He shews that a Poet of less Judgment would amuse himself in less important Circumstances and spoil the whole Effect of the Image by minute illchosen or superfluous Particulars Thus  Aratus  endeavouring to refine upon that Line  And instant Death on ev'ry Wave appears  He turn'd it thus  A slender Plank preserves them from their Fate  Which by flourishing upon the Thought has lost the Loftiness and Terror of it and is so far from improving the Image that it lessens and vanishes in his Management By confining the Danger to a single Line he has scarce left the Shadow of it and indeed the word  preserves  takes away even that The same Critick produces a Fragment of an old Poem on the  Arimaspians  written in this false Taste whose Author he doubts not imagin'd he had said something wonderful in the following affected Verses I have done my best to give 'em the same turn and believe there are those who will not think 'em bad ones  Ye Pow'rs what Madness How on Ships so frail  Tremendous Thought can thoughtless Mortals sail  For stormy Seas they quit the pleasing Plain  Plant Woods in Waves and dwell amidst the Main  Far o'er the Deep a trackless Path they goe  And wander Oceans in pursuit of Woe  No Ease their Hearts no Rest their Eyes can find  On Heav'n their Looks and on the Waves their Mind  Sunk are their Spirits while their Arms they rear  And Gods are weary'd with their fruitless Pray'r  XXXII  VERSE Nestor  's Speech    This popular Harangue of  Nestor  is justly extoll'd as the strongest and most persuasive Piece of Oratory imaginable It contains in it every Motive by which Men can be affected the Preservation of their Wives and Children the secure Possession of their Fortunes the Respect of their living Parents and the due Regard for the Memory of those that were departed By these he diverts the  Grecians  from any Thoughts of Flight in the Article of extreme Peril  Eustathius  This noble Exhortation is finely imitated by  Tasso Jerusalem l    O valoroso hor via con questa  Faccia a ritor la preda a noi rapita  L'imagine ad alcuno in mente desta  Glie la figura quasi e glie l'addita  De la pregante patria e de la mesta  Supplice famiglivola sbigottita  Credi dicea che la tua patria spieghi  Per la mia lingua in tai parole i preghi  Guarda tù le mie leggi e i sacri Tempi  Fà ch'io del sangue mio non bagni e lavi  Assicura le virgini da gli empi  E i sepolchri e le cinere de gli avi  A te piangendo i lor passati tempi  Mostran la bianca chioma i vecchi gravi  A tè la moglie e le mammelle e'l petto  Le cune e i figli e'l marital suo letto  XXXIII  VERSE  First of the Field great  Ajax  In this very Book  Homer  to raise the Valour of  Hector  gives him  Neptune  for an Antagonist and to raise that of  Ajax  he first opposed to him  Hector  supported by  Apollo  and now the same  Hector  impell'd and seconded by  Jupiter  himself These are Strokes of a Masterhand  Eustathius  XXXIV  VERSE  Drives four fair Coursers  c  The Comparison which  Homer  here introduces is a Demonstration that the Art of mounting and managing Horses was brought to so great a Perfection in these early Times that one Man could manage four at once and leap from one to the other even when they run full speed But some object that the Custom of Riding was not known in  Greece  at the time of the  Trojan  War Besides they say the  Comparison is not just for the Horses are said to run full speed whereas the Ships stand firm and unmov'd Had  Homer  put the Comparison in the Mouth of one of his Heroes the Objection had been just and he guilty of an Inconsistency but it is he himself who speaks SaddleHorses were in use in his Age and any Poet may be allow'd to illustrate Pieces of Antiquity by Images familiar to his own Times This I hope is sufficient for the first Objection nor is the second more reasonable than this for it is not absolutely necessary that Comparisons should correspond in every Particular it suffices if there be a general Resemblance This is only introduced to shew the Agility of  Ajax  who passes swiftly from one Vessel to another and is therefore entirely just  Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE  The same that dead  Protesilaus  bore    Homer  feigns that  Hector  laid hold on the Ship of the dead  Protesilaus  rather than that of any other that he might not disgrace any of his  Grecian  Generals  Eustathius  XXXVI  VERSE  The Coward Counsels of a tim'rous Throng  Of rev'rend Dotards    Homer  adds this with a great deal of Art and Prudence to answer beforehand all the Objections which he well foresaw might be made because  Hector  never till now once attacks the  Grecians  in their Camp or endeavours to burn their Navy He was retain'd by the Elders of  Troy  who frozen with Fear at the Sight of  Achilles  never suffer'd him to march from the Ramparts Our Author forgets nothing that has the Resemblance of Truth but he had yet a farther Reason for inserting this as it exalts the Glory of his principal Hero These Elders of  Troy  thought it less difficult to defeat the  Greeks  tho' defended with strong Entrenchments while  Achilles  was not with them than to overcome them without  Entrenchments when he assisted them And this is the reason that they prohibited  Hector  before and permit him now to sally upon the Enemy  Dacier  XXXVII  VERSE  But now  Jove  calls to Arms  c  Hector  seems to be sensible of an extraordinary Impulse from Heaven signified by these Words  the most mighty Hand of  Jove  pushing him on  'Tis no more than any other Person would be ready to imagine who should rise from a State of Distress or Indolence into one of good Fortune Vigour and Activity  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  The Speech of  Ajax  There is great Strength Closeness and Spirit in this Speech and one might like many Criticks employ a whole Page in extolling and admiring it in general Terms But sure the perpetual Rapture of such Commentators who are always giving us Exclamations instead of Criticisms may be a Mark of great Admiration but of little Judgment Of what Use is this either to a Reader who has a Taste or to one who has not To admire a fine Passage is what the former will do without us and what the latter cannot be taught to do by us However we ought gratefully to acknowledge the good Nature of most People who are not only pleased with this superficial Applause given to fine Passages but are likewise inclined to transfer to the Critick who only points at these Beauties part of the Admiration justly due to the Poet This is a cheap and easy way to Fame which many Writers ancient and modern have pursued with great Success Formerly indeed this sort of Authors had Modesty and were humbly content to call their Performances only  Florilegia  or  Posies  But some of late have pass'd such Collections on the World for Criticisms of great Depth and Learning and seem to expect the same Flowers should please us better in these paltry  Nosegays of their own making up than in the native Gardens where they grew As this Practice of extolling without giving Reasons is very convenient for most Writers so it excellently suits the Ignorance or Laziness of most Readers who will come into any Sentiment rather than take the trouble of refuting it Thus the Complement is mutual For as such Criticks do not tax their Readers with any thought to understand them so their Readers in Return advance nothing in Opposition to such Criticks They may go roundly on admiring and exclaiming in this manner  What an exquisite Spirit of PoetryHow beautiful a CircumstanceWhat Delicacy of SentimentsWith what Art has the PoetIn how sublime and just a mannerHow finely imaginedHow wonderfully beautiful and poetical  And so proceed without one Reason to interrupt the Course of their Eloquence most comfortably and ignorantly Apostrophising to the end of the Chapter  THE SIXTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The sixth Battel The Acts and Death of  Patroclus  PAtroclus  in Pursuance of the Request of  Nestor  in the eleventh Book entreats  Achilles  to suffer him to go to the Assistance of the  Greeks  with  Achilles  's Troops and Armour He agrees to it but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the Fleet without farther Pursuit of the Enemy The Armour Horses Soldiers and Officers of  Achilles  are described  Achilles  offers a Libation for the Success of his Friend after which  Patroclus  leads the  Myrmidons  to Battel The  Trojans  at the Sight of  Patroclus  in  Achilles  's Armour taking him for that Hero are cast into the utmost Consternation He beats them off from the Vessels  Hector  himself flies  Sarpedon  is kill'd tho'  Jupiter  was averse to his Fate Several other Particulars of the Battel are described in the Heat of which  Patroclus  neglecting the Orders of  Achilles  pursues the Foe to the Walls of  Troy  where  Apollo  repulses and disarms him  Euphorbus  wounds him and  Hector  kills him which concludes the Book  THE SIXTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  SO warr'd both Armies on th' ensanguin'd Shore  While the black Vessels smoak'd with human gore  Meantime  Patroclus  to  Achilles  flies  The streaming Tears fall copious from his Eyes  Not faster trickling to the Plains below  From the tall Rock the sable Waters flow  Divine  Pelides  with Compassion mov'd  Thus spoke indulgent to his best belov'd  Patroclus  say what Grief thy Bosom bears  That flows so fast in these unmanly Tears  No Girl no Infant whom the Mother keeps  From her lov'd Breast with fonder Passion weeps  Not more the Mother's Soul that Infant warms  Clung to her Knees and reaching at her Arms  Than thou hast mine Oh tell me to what end  Thy melting Sorrows thus pursue thy Friend  Griev'st thou for me or for my martial Band  Or come sad Tidings from our native Land  Our Fathers live our first most tender Care  Thy good  Menoetius  breathes the vital Air  And hoary  Peleus  yet extends his Days  Pleas'd in their Age to hear their Children's Praise  Or may some meaner Cause thy Pity claim  Perhaps yon' Reliques of the  Grecian  Name  Doom'd in their Ships to sink by Fire and Sword  And pay the Forfeit of their haughty Lord  Whate'er the Cause reveal thy secret Care  And speak those Sorrows which a Friend would share  A Sigh that instant from his Bosom broke  Another follow'd and  Patroclus  spoke  Let  Greece  at length with Pity touch thy Breast  Thy self a  Greek  and once of  Greeks  the best  Lo ev'ry Chief that might her Fate prevent  Lies pierc'd with Wounds and bleeding in his Tent  Eurypylus Tydides Atreus'  Son  And wise  Ulysses  at the Navy groan  More for their Country's Wounds than for their own  Their Pain soft Arts of Pharmacy can ease  Thy Breast alone no Lenitives appease  May never Rage like thine my Soul enslave  O great in vain unprofitably brave  Thy Country slighted in her last Distress  What Friend what Man from thee shall hope redress  NoMen unborn and Ages yet behind  Shall curse that fierce that unforgiving Mind  O Man unpitying if of Man thy Race  But sure thou spring'st not from a soft Embrace  Nor ever am'rous Hero caus'd thy Birth  Nor ever tender Goddess brought thee forth  Some rugged Rock's hard Entrails gave thee Form  And raging Seas produc'd thee in a Storm  A Soul wellsuiting that tempestuous Kind  So rough thy Manners so untam'd thy Mind  If some dire Oracle thy Breast alarm  If ought from  Jove  or  Thetis  stop thy Arm  Some Beam of Comfort yet on  Greece  may shine  If I but lead the  Myrmidonian  Line  Clad in thy dreadful Arms if I appear  Proud  Troy  shall tremble and desert the War  Without thy Person  Greece  shall win the Day  And thy mere Image chase her Foes away  Press'd by fresh Forces her o'erlabour'd Train  Shall quit the Ships and  Greece  respire again  Thus blind to Fate with supplicating Breath  Thou beg'st his Arms and in his Arms thy Death  Unfortunately Good a boding Sigh  Thy Friend return'd and with it this Reply  Patroclus  thy  Achilles  knows no Fears  Nor Words from  Jove  nor  Oracles  he hears  Nor ought a Mother's Caution can suggest  The Tyrant's Pride lies rooted in my Breast  My Wrongs my Wrongs my constant Thought engage  Those my sole Oracles inspire my Rage  I made him Tyrant gave him Pow'r to wrong  Ev'n me I felt it and shall feel it long  The Maid my blackey'd Maid he forc'd away  Due to the Toils of many a wellfought Day  Due to my Conquest of her Father's Reign  Due to the Votes of all the  Grecian  Train  From me he forc'd her me the bold and brave  Disgrac'd dishonour'd like the meanest Slave  But bear we thisThe Wrongs I grieve are past  'Tis time our Fury should relent at last  I fix'd its Date the Day I wish'd appears  Now  Hector  to my Ships his Battel bears  The Flames my Eyes the Shouts invade my Ears  Go then  Patroclus  court fair Honour's Charms  In  Troy  's fam'd Fields and in  Achilles'  Arms  Lead forth my martial  Myrmidons  to fight  Go save the Fleets and conquer in my right  See the thin Reliques of their baffled Band  At the last Edge of yon' deserted Land  Behold all  Ilion  on their Ships descends  How the Cloud blackens how the Storm impends  It was not thus when at my Sight amaz'd  Troy  saw and trembled as this Helmet blaz'd  Had not th' injurious King our Friendship lost  Yon' ample Trench had bury'd half her Host  No Camps no Bulwarks now the  Trojans  fear  Those are not dreadful no  Achilles  there  No longer flames the Lance of  Tydeus'  Son  No more your Gen'ral calls his Heroes on  Hector  alone I hear His dreadful Breath  Commands your Slaughter or proclaims your Death  Yet now  Patroclus  issue to the Plain  Now save the Ships the rising Fires restrain  And give the  Greeks  to visit  Greece  again  But heed my Words and mark a Friend's Command  Who trusts his Fame and Honours in thy Hand  And from thy Deeds expects th'  Achaian  Host  Shall render back the beauteous Maid he lost  Rage uncontroul'd thro' all the hostile Crew  But touch not  Hector Hector  is my due  Tho'  Jove  in Thunder should command the War  Be just consult my Glory and forbear  The Fleet once sav'd desist from farther chace  Nor lead to  Ilion's  Walls the  Grecian  Race  Some adverse God thy Rashness may destroy  Some God like  Phoebus  ever kind to  Troy  Let  Greece  redeem'd from this destructive Strait  Do her own Work and leave the rest to Fate  Oh would to all th' immortal Pow'rs above  Apollo Pallas  and almighty  Jove  That not one  Trojan  might be left alive  And not a  Greek  of all the Race survive  Might only we the vast Destruction shun  And only we destroy th' accursed Town  Such Conf'rence held the Chiefs while on the Strand  Great  Jove  with Conquest crown'd the  Trojan  Band  Ajax  no more the sounding Storm sustain'd  So thick the Darts an Iron Tempest rain'd  On his tir'd Arm the weighty Buckler hung  His hollow Helm with falling Javelins rung  His Breath in quick short Pantings comes and goes  And painful Sweat from all his Members flows  Spent and o'erpow'r'd he barely breathes at most  Yet scarce an Army stirs him from his Post  Dangers on Dangers all around him grow  And Toil to Toil and Woe succeeds to Woe  Say Muses thron'd above the starry Frame  How first the Navy blaz'd with  Trojan  Flame  Stern  Hector  wav'd his Sword and standing near  Where furious  Ajax  ply'd his Ashen Spear  Full on the Lance a Stroke so justly sped  That the broad Faulchion lopp'd its brazen Head  His pointless Spear the Warrior shakes in vain  The brazen Head falls sounding on the Plain  Great  Ajax  saw and own'd the Hand divine  Confessing  Jove  and trembling at the Sign  Warn'd he retreats Then swift from all sides pour  The hissing Brands thick streams the fiery Show'r  O'er the high Stern the curling Volumes rise  And Sheets of rolling Smoke involve the Skies  Divine  Achilles  view'd the rising Flames  And smote his Thigh and thus aloud exclaims  Arm arm  Patroclus  Lo the Blaze aspires  The glowing Ocean reddens with the Fires  Arm e'er our Vessels catch the spreading Flame  Arm e'er the  Grecians  be no more a Name  I haste to bring the TroopsThe Hero said  The Friend with Ardour and with Joy obey'd  He cas'd his Limbs in Brass and first around  His manly Legs with silver Buckles bound  The clasping Greaves then to his Breast applies  The flamy Cuirass of a thousand Dyes  Emblaz'd with Studs of Gold his Faulchion shone  In the rich Belt as in a starry Zone  Achilles'  Shield his ample Shoulders spread  Achilles'  Helmet nodded o'er his Head  Adorn'd in all his terrible Array  He flash'd around intolerable Day  Alone untouch'd  Pelides'  Javelin stands  Not to be pois'd but by  Pelides'  Hands  From  Pelion  's shady Brow the Plant entire  Old  Chiron  rent and shap'd it for his Sire  Whose Son's great Arm alone the Weapon wields  The Death of Heroes and the dread of Fields  Then brave  Automedon  an honour'd Name  The second to his Lord in Love and Fame  In Peace his Friend and Part'ner of the War  The winged Coursers harness'd to the Car  Xanthus  and  Balius  of immortal Breed  Sprung from the Wind and like the Wind in speed  Whom the wing'd  Harpye  swift  Podarge  bore  By  Zephyr  pregnant on the breezy Shore  Swift  Pedasus  was added to their side  Once great  Aëtion  's now  Achilles'  Pride  Who like in Strength in Swiftness and in Grace  A mortal Courser match'd th' immortal Race  Achilles  speeds from Tent to Tent and warms  His hardy  Myrmidons  to Blood and Arms  All breathing Death around their Chief they stand  A grim terrific formidable Band  Grim as voracious Wolves that seek the Springs  When scalding Thirst their burning Bowels wrings  When some tall Stag freshslaughter'd in the Wood  Has drench'd their wide insatiate Throats with Blood  To the black Fount they rush a hideous Throng  With Paunch distended and with rolling Tongue  Fire fills their Eyes their black Jaws belch the Gore  And gorg'd with Slaughter still they thirst for more  Like furious rush'd the  Myrmidonian  Crew  Such their dread Strength and such their deathful View  High in the midst the great  Achilles  stands  Directs their Order and the War commands  He lov'd of  Jove  had launch'd for  Ilion  's Shores  Full fifty Vessels mann'd with fifty Oars  Five chosen Leaders the fierce Bands obey  Himself supreme in Valour as in Sway  First march'd  Menestheus  of celestial Birth  Deriv'd from thee whose Waters wash the Earth  Divine  Sperchius Jove  descended Flood  A mortal Mother mixing with a God  Such was  Menestheus  but miscall'd by Fame  The Son of  Borus  that espous'd the Dame  Eudorus  next whom  Polymele  the gay  Fam'd in the graceful Dance produc'd to Day  Her sly  Cyllenius  lov'd on her would gaze  As with swift Step she form'd the running Maze  To her high Chamber from  Diana  's Quire  The God pursu'd her urg'd and crown'd his Fire  The Son confess'd his Father's heav'nly Race  And heir'd his Mother's Swiftness in the Chace  Strong  Echecloeus  blest in all those Charms  That pleas'd a God succeeded to her Arms  Not conscious of her Love long hid from Fame  With Gifts of Price he sought and won the Dame  Her secret Offspring to her Sire she bare  Her Sire caress'd him with a Parent's Care  Pisander  follow'd matchless in his Art  To wing the Spear or aim the distant Dart  No Hand so sure of all th'  Emathian  Line  Or if a surer great  Patroclus  thine  The fourth by  Phoenix'  grave Command was grac'd  Laerces'  valiant Offspring led the last  Soon as  Achilles  with superior Care  Had call'd the Chiefs and order'd all the War  This stern Remembrance to his Troops he gave  Ye farfam'd  Myrmidons  ye fierce and brave  Think with what Threats you dar'd the  Trojan  Throng  Think what Reproach these Ears endur'd so long  "Stern Son of  Peleus  thus ye us'd to say  While restless raging in your Ships you lay  "Oh nurs'd with Gall unknowing how to yield  "Whose Rage defrauds us of so fam'd a Field  "If that dire Fury must for ever burn  "What make we here Return ye Chiefs return  Such were your wordsNow Warriors grieve no more  Lo there the  Trojans  bath your Swords in Gore  This Day shall give you all your Soul demands  Glut all your Hearts and weary all your Hands  Thus while he rowz'd the Fire in ev'ry Breast  Close and more close the list'ning Cohorts prest  Ranks wedg'd in Ranks of Arms a steely Ring  Still grows and spreads and thickens round the King  As when a circling Wall the Builder forms  Of Strength defensive against Winds and Storms  Compacted Stones the thick'ning Work compose  And round him wide the rising Structure grows  So Helm to Helm and Crest to Crest they throng  Shield urg'd on Shield and Man drove Man along  Thick undistinguish'd Plumes together join'd  Float in one Sea and wave before the Wind  Far o'er the rest in glitt'ring Pomp appear  There bold  Automedon Patroclus  here  Brothers in Arms with equal Fury fir'd  Two Friends two Bodies with one Soul inspir'd  But mindful of the Gods  Achilles  went  To the rich Coffer in his shady Tent  There lay on Heaps his various Garments roll'd  And costly Furs and Carpets stiff with Gold  The Presents of the silverfooted Dame  From thence he took a Bowl of antique Frame  Which never Man had stain'd with ruddy Wine  Nor rais'd in Off'rings to the Pow'rs divine  But  Peleus'  Son and  Peleus'  Son to none  Had rais'd in Off'rings but to  Jove  alone  This ting'd with Sulphur sacred first to Flame  He purg'd and wash'd it in the running Stream  Then cleans'd his Hands and fixing for a Space  His Eyes on Heaven his Feet upon the Place  Of Sacrifice the purple Draught he pour'd  Forth in the midst and thus the God implor'd  Oh thou Supreme highthron'd all Height above  Oh Great  Pelasgic Dodonaean Jove  Who 'midst surrounding Frosts and Vapours chill  Preside on bleak  Dodona  's vocal Hill  Whose Groves the  Selli  Race austere surround  Their Feet unwash'd their Slumbers on the Ground  Who hear from rustling Oaks their dark Decrees  And catch the Fates lowwhisper'd in the Breeze  Hear as of old Thou gav'st at  Thetis  Pray'r  Glory to me and to the  Greeks  Despair  Lo to the Dangers of the fighting Field  The best the dearest of my Friends I yield  Tho' still determin'd to my Ships confin'd  Patroclus  gone I stay but half behind  Oh be his Guard thy providential Care  Confirm his Heart and string his Arm to War  Press'd by his single Force let  Hector  see  His Fame in Arms not owing all to me  But when the Fleets are sav'd from Foes and Fire  Let him with Conquest and Renown retire  Preserve his Arms preserve his social Train  And safe return him to these Eyes again  Great  Jove  consents to half the Chief's Request  But Heav'ns eternal Doom denies the rest  To free the Fleet was granted to his Pray'r  His safe Return the Winds dispers'd in Air  Back to his Tent the stern  Achilles  flies  And waits the Combate with impatient Eyes  Meanwhile the Troops beneath  Patroclus'  Care  Invade the  Trojans  and commence the War  As Wasps provok'd by Children in their Play  Pour from their Mansions by the broad Highway  In Swarms the guiltless Traveller engage  Whet all their Stings and call forth all their Rage  All rise in Arms and with a gen'ral Cry  Assert their waxen Domes and buzzing Progeny  Thus from the Tents the fervent Legion swarms  So loud their Clamours and so keen their Arms  Their rising Rage  Patroclus'  Breath inspires  Who thus inflames them with heroick Fires  Oh Warriors Part'ners of  Achilles'  Praise  Be mindful of your Deeds in ancient Days  Your godlike Master let your Acts proclaim  And add new Glories to his mighty Name  Think your  Achilles  sees you fight Be brave  And humble the proud Monarch whom you save  Joyful they heard and kindling as he spoke  Flew to the Fleet involv'd in Fire and Smoke  From Shore to Shore the doubling Shouts resound  The hollow Ships return a deeper Sound  The War stood still and all around them gaz'd  When great  Achilles'  shining Armour blaz'd  Troy  saw and thought the dread  Achilles  nigh  At once they see they tremble and they fly  Then first thy Spear divine  Patroclus  flew  Where the War rag'd and where the Tumult grew  Close to the Stern of that fam'd Ship which bore  Unblest  Protesilaus  to  Ilion  's Shore  The great  Paeonian  bold  Pyrechmes  stood  Who led his Bands from  Axius'  winding Flood  His Shoulderblade receives the fatal Wound  The groaning Warrior pants upon the Ground  His Troops that see their Country's Glory slain  Fly diverse scatter'd o'er the distant Plain  Patroclus'  Arm forbids the spreading Fires  And from the halfburn'd Ship proud  Troy  retires  Clear'd from the Smoke the joyful Navy lies  In Heaps on Heaps the Foe tumultuous flies  Triumphant  Greece  her rescu'd Decks ascends  And loud Acclaim the starry Region rends  So when thick Clouds inwrap the Mountain's Head  O'er Heav'ns Expanse like one black Cieling spread  Sudden the Thund'rer with a flashing Ray  Bursts thro' the Darkness and lets down the Day  The Hills shine out the Rocks in Prospect rise  And Streams and Vales and Forests strike the Eyes  The smiling Scene wide opens to the Sight  And all th' unmeasur'd  Aether  flames with Light  But  Troy  repuls'd and scatter'd o'er the Plains  Forc'd from the Navy yet the Fight maintains  Now ev'ry  Greek  some hostile Hero slew  But still the foremost bold  Patroclus  flew  As  Areïlycus  had turn'd him round  Sharp in his Thigh he felt the piercing Wound  The brazenpointed Spear with Vigour thrown  The Thigh transfix'd and broke the brittle Bone  Headlong he fell Next  Thoas  was thy Chance  Thy Breast unarm'd receiv'd the  Spartan  Lance  Phylides'  Dart as  Amphiclus  drew nigh  His Blow prevented and transpierc'd his Thigh  Tore all the Brawn and rent the Nerves away  In Darkness and in Death the Warrior lay  In equal Arms two Sons of  Nestor  stand  And two bold Brothers of the  Lycian  Band  By great  Antilochus Atymnius  dies  Pierc'd in the Flank lamented Youth he lies  Kind  Maris  bleeding in his Brother's Wound  Defends the breathless Carcase on the Ground  Furious he flies his Murd'rer to engage  But godlike  Thrasimed  prevents his Rage  Between his Arm and Shoulder aims a Blow  His Arm falls spouting on the Dust below  He sinks with endless Darkness cover'd o'er  And vents his Soul effus'd with gushing Gore  Slain by two Brothers thus two Brothers bleed  Sarpedon  's Friends  Amisodarus'  Seed  Amisodarus  who by Furies led  The Bane of Men abhorr'd  Chimaera  bred  Skill'd in the Dart in vain his Sons expire  And pay the Forfeit of their guilty Sire  Stopp'd in the Tumult  Cleobulus  lies  Beneath  Oileus'  Arm a living Prize  A living Prize not long the  Trojan  stood  The thirsty Faulchion drank his reeking Blood  Plung'd in his Throat the smoaking Weapon lies  Black Death and Fate unpitying seal his Eyes  Amid the Ranks with mutual Thirst of Fame  Lycon  the brave and fierce  Peneleus  came  In vain their Javelins at each other flew  Now met in Arms their eager Swords they drew  On the plum'd Crest of his  Boeotian  Foe  The daring  Lycon  aim'd a noble Blow  The Sword broke short but his  Peneleus  sped  Full on the Juncture of the Neck and Head  The Head divided by a Stroke so just  Hung by the Skin the Body sunk to Dust  O'ertaken  Neamas  by  Merion  bleeds  Pierc'd thro' the Shoulder as he mounts his Steeds  Back from the Car he tumbles to the Ground  His swimming Eyes eternal Shades surround  Next  Erymas  was doom'd his Fate to feel  His open'd Mouth receiv'd the  Cretan  Steel  Beneath the Brain the Point a Passage tore  Crash'd the thin Bones and drown'd the Teeth in Gore  His Mouth his Eyes his Nostrils pour a Flood  He sobs his Soul out in the Gush of Blood  As when the Flocks neglected by the Swain  Or Kids or Lambs lie scatter'd o'er the Plain  A Troop of Wolves th' unguarded Charge survey  And rend the trembling unresisting Prey  Thus on the Foe the  Greeks  impetuous came  Troy  fled unmindful of her former Fame  But still at  Hector  godlike  Ajax  aim'd  Still pointed at his Breast his Javelin flam'd  The  Trojan  Chief experienc'd in the Field  O'er his broad Shoulders spread the massy Shield  Observ'd the Storm of Darts the  Grecians  pour  And on his Buckler caught the ringing Show'r  He sees for  Greece  the Scale of Conquest rise  Yet stops and turns and saves his lov'd Allies  As when the Hand of  Jove  a Tempest forms  And rolls the Cloud to blacken Heav'n with Storms  Dark o'er the Fields th' ascending Vapour flies  And shades the Sun and blots the golden Skies  So from the Ships along the dusky Plain  Dire  Flight  and  Terror  drove the  Trojan  Train  Ev'n  Hector  fled thro' Heaps of Disarray  The fiery Coursers forc'd their Lord away  While far behind his  Trojans  fall confus'd  Wedg'd in the Trench in one vast Carnage bruis'd  Chariots on Chariots rowl the clashing Spokes  Shock while the madding Steeds break short their Yokes  In vain they labour up the steepy Mound  Their Charioteers lie foaming on the Ground  Fierce on the Rear with Shouts  Patroclus  flies  Tumultuous Clamour fills the Fields and Skies  Thick Drifts of Dust involve their rapid Flight  Clouds rise on Clouds and Heav'n is snatch'd from sight  Th' affrighted Steeds their dying Lords cast down  Scour o'er the Fields and stretch to reach the Town  Loud o'er the Rout was heard the Victor's Cry  Where the War bleeds and where the thickest die  Where Horse and Arms and Chariots lie o'erthrown  And bleeding Heroes under Axles groan  No Stop no Check the Steeds of  Peleus  knew  From Bank to Bank th' immortal Coursers flew  Highbounding o'er the Fosse the whirling Car  Smoaks thro' the Ranks o'ertakes the flying War  And thunders after  Hector Hector  flies  Patroclus  shakes his Lance but Fate denies  Not with less Noise with less impetuous force  The Tyde of  Trojans  urge their desp'rate Course  Than when in Autumn  Jove  his Fury pours  And Earth is loaden with incessant Show'rs  When guilty Mortals break th' eternal Laws  And Judges brib'd betray the righteous Cause  From their deep Beds he bids the Rivers rise  And opens all the Floodgates of the Skies  Th' impetuous Torrents from their Hills obey  Whole Fields are drown'd and Mountains swept away  Loud roars the Deluge till it meets the Main  And trembling Man sees all his Labours vain  And now the Chief the foremost Troops repell'd  Back to the Ships his destin'd Progress held  Bore down half  Troy  in his resistless way  And forc'd the routed Ranks to stand the Day  Between the Space where silver  Simois  flows  Where lay the Fleets and where the Rampires rose  All grim in Dust and Blood  Patroclus  stands  And turns the Slaughter on the conqu'ring Bands  First  Pronous  dy'd beneath his fiery Dart  Which pierc'd below the Shield his valiant Heart  Thestor  was next who saw the Chief appear  And fell the Victim of his coward Fear  Shrunk up he sate with wild and haggard Eye  Nor stood to combate nor had Force to fly  Patroclus  mark'd him as he shunn'd the War  And with unmanly Tremblings shook the Car  And dropp'd the flowing Reins Him 'twixt the Jaws  The Javelin sticks and from the Chariot draws  As on a Rock that overhangs the Main  An Angler studious of the Line and Cane  Some mighty Fish draws panting to the Shore  Not with less ease the barbed Javelin bore  The gaping Dastard As the Spear was shook  He fell and Life his heartless Breast forsook  Next on  Eryalus  he flies a Stone  Large as a Rock was by his Fury thrown  Full on his Crown the pond'rous Fragment flew  And burst the Helm and cleft the Head in two  Prone to the Ground the breathless Warrior fell  And Death involv'd him with the Shades of Hell  Then low in Dust  Epaltes Echius  lie  Ipheas Evippus Polymelus  die  Amphoterus  and  Erymas  succeed  And last  Tlepolemus  and  Pyres  bleed  Where'er he moves the growing Slaughters spread  In Heaps on Heaps a Monument of Dead  When now  Sarpedon  his brave Friends beheld  Grov'ling in Dust and gasping on the Field  With this Reproach his flying Host he warms  Oh Stain to Honour oh Disgrace to Arms  Forsake inglorious the contended Plain  This Hand unaided shall the War sustain  The Task be mine this Hero's Strength to try  Who mows whole Troops and makes an Army fly  He spake and speaking leaps from off the Car  Patroclus  lights and sternly waits the War  As when two Vulturs on the Mountain's Height  Stoop with resounding Pinions to the Fight  They cuff they tear they raise a screaming Cry  The Desert echoes and the Rocks reply  The Warriors thus oppos'd in Arms engage  With equal Clamours and with equal Rage  Jove  view'd the Combate whose Event foreseen  He thus bespoke his Sister and his Queen  The Hour draws on the Destinies ordain  My godlike Son shall press the  Phrygian  Plain  Already on the Verge of Death he stands  His Life is ow'd to fierce  Patroclus'  Hands  What Passions in a Parent's Breast debate  Say shall I snatch him from impending Fate  And send him safe to  Lycia  distant far  From all the Dangers and the Toils of War  Or to his Doom my bravest Offspring yield  And fatten with celestial Blood the Field  Then thus the Goddess with the radiant Eyes  What Words are these O Sov'reign of the Skies  Short is the Date prescrib'd to mortal Man  Shall  Jove  for one extend the narrow Span  Whose Bounds were fix'd before his Race began  How many Sons of Gods foredoom'd to Death  Before proud  Ilion  must resign their Breath  Were thine exempt Debate would rise above  And murm'ring Pow'rs condemn their partial  Jove  Give the bold Chief a glorious Fate in fight  And when th' ascending Soul has wing'd her flight  Let  Sleep  and  Death  convey by thy Command  The breathless Body to his native Land  His Friends and People to his future Praise  A marble Tomb and Pyramid shall raise  And lasting Honours to his Ashes give  His Fame 'tis all the Dead can have shall live  She said the Cloudcompeller overcome  Assents to Fate and ratifies the Doom  Then touch'd with Grief the weeping Heav'ns distill'd  A Show'r of Blood o'er all the fatal Field  The God his Eyes averting from the Plain  Laments his Son predestin'd to be slain  Far from the  Lycian  Shores his happy native Reign  Now met in Arms the Combatants appear  Each heav'd the Shield and pois'd the lifted Spear  From strong  Patroclus'  Hand the Javelin fled  And pass'd the Groin of valiant  Thrasymed  The Nerves unbrac'd no more his Bulk sustain  He falls and falling bites the bloody Plain  Two sounding Darts the  Lycian  Leader threw  The first aloof with erring Fury flew  The next transpierc'd  Achilles'  mortal Steed  The gen'rous  Pedasus  of  Theban  Breed  Fix'd in the Shoulders Joint he reel'd around  Rowl'd in the bloody dust and paw'd the slip'ry ground  His sudden Fall th' entangled Harness broke  Each Axle crackled and the Chariot shook  When bold  Automedon  to disengage  The starting Coursers and restrain their Rage  Divides the Traces with his Sword and freed  Th' incumber'd Chariot from the dying Steed  The rest move on obedient to the Rein  The Car rowls slowly o'er the dusty Plain  The tow'ring Chiefs to fiercer Fight advance  And first  Sarpedon  whirl'd his weighty Lance  Which o'er the Warrior's Shoulder took its course  And spent in empty Air its dying Force  Not so  Patroclus'  never erring Dart  Aim'd at his Breast it pierc'd the mortal Part  Where the strong Fibres bind the solid Heart  Then as the Mountain Oak or Poplar tall  Or Pine fit Mast for some great Admiral  Nods to the Axe till with a groaning Sound  It sinks and spreads its Honours on the Ground  Thus fell the King and laid on Earth supine  Before his Chariot stretch'd his Form divine  He grasp'd the Dust distain'd with streaming Gore  And pale in Death lay groaning on the Shore  So lies a Bull beneath the Lion's Paws  While the grim Savage grinds with foamy Jaws  The trembling Limbs and sucks the smoaking Blood  Deep groans and hollow roars rebellow thro' the Wood  Then to the Leader of the  Lycian  Band  The dying Chief address'd his last Command  Glaucus  be bold thy Task be first to dare  The glorious Dangers of destructive War  To lead my Troops to combate at their Head  Incite the Living and supply the Dead  Tell 'em I charg'd them with my latest Breath  Not unreveng'd to bear  Sarpedon  's Death  What Grief what Shame must  Glaucus  undergo  If these spoil'd Arms adorn a  Grecian  Foe  Then as a Friend and as a Warrior fight  Defend my Corpse and conquer in my Right  That taught by great Examples all may try  Like thee to vanquish or like me to die  He ceas'd the Fates suppress'd his lab'ring Breath  And his Eyes darken'd with the Shades of Death  Th' insulting Victor with Disdain bestrode  The prostrate Prince and on his Bosom trod  Then drew the Weapon from his panting Heart  The reeking Fibres clinging to the Dart  From the wide Wound gush'd out a Stream of Blood  And the Soul issu'd in the purple Flood  His flying Steeds the  Myrmidons  detain  Unguided now their mighty Master slain  Allimpotent of Aid transfix'd with Grief  Unhappy  Glaucus  heard the dying Chief  His painful Arm yet useless with the Smart  Inflicted late by  Teucer  's deadly Dart  Supported on his better Hand he stay'd  To  Phoebus  then 'twas all he could he pray'd  Allseeing Monarch whether  Lycia  's Coast  Or sacred  Ilion  thy bright Presence boast  Pow'rful alike to ease the Wretche's Smart  Oh hear me God of ev'ry healing Art  Lo stiff with clotted Blood and pierc'd with Pain  That thrills my Arm and shoots thro' ev'ry Vein  I stand unable to sustain the Spear  And sigh at distance from the glorious War  Low in the Dust is great  Sarpedon  laid  Nor  Jove  vouchsaf'd his hapless Off'ring Aid  But thou O God of Health thy Succour lend  To guard the Reliques of my slaughter'd Friend  For thou tho' distant can'st restore my Might  To head my  Lycians  and support the Fight  Apollo  heard and suppliant as he stood  His heav'nly Hand restrain'd the Flux of Blood  He drew the Dolours from the wounded Part  And breath'd a Spirit in his rising Heart  Renew'd by Art divine the Hero stands  And owns th' Assistance of immortal Hands  First to the Fight his native Troops he warms  Then loudly calls on  Troy  's vindictive Arms  With ample Strides he stalks from Place to Place  Now fires  Agenor  now  Polydamas  Aeneas  next and  Hector  he accosts  Inflaming thus the Rage of all their Hosts  What Thoughts regardless Chief thy Breast employ  Oh too forgetful of the Friends of  Troy  Those gen'rous Friends who from their Country far  Breathe their brave Souls out in another's War  See where in Dust the great  Sarpedon  lies  In Action valiant and in Council wise  Who guarded Right and kept his People free  To all his  Lycians  lost and lost to thee  Stretch'd by  Patroclus'  Arm on yonder Plains  Oh save from hostile Rage his lov'd Remains  Ah let not  Greece  his conquer'd Trophies boast  Nor on his Corpse revenge her Heroes lost  He spoke each Leader in his Grief partook  Troy  at the Loss thro' all her Legions shook  Tranfix'd with deep Regret they view'd o'erthrown  At once his Country's Pillar and their own  A Chief who led to  Troy  's beleaguer'd Wall  A Host of Heroes and outshin'd them all  Fir'd they rush on First  Hector  seeks the Foes  And with superior Vengeance greatly glows  But o'er the Dead the fierce  Patroclus  stands  And rowzing  Ajax  rowz'd the list'ning Bands  Heroes be Men be what you were before  Or weigh the great Occasion and be more  The Chief who taught our lofty Walls to yield  Lies pale in Death extended on the Field  To guard his Body  Troy  in Numbers flies  'Tis half the Glory to maintain our Prize  Haste strip his Arms the Slaughter round him spread  And send the living  Lycians  to the Dead  The Heroes kindle at his fierce Command  The martial Squadrons close on either Hand  Here  Troy  and  Lycia  charge with loud Alarms  Thessalia  there and  Greece  oppose their Arms  With horrid Shouts they circle round the Slain  The Clash of Armour rings o'er all the Plain  Great  Jove  to swell the Horrors of the Fight  O'er the fierce Armies pours pernicious Night  And round his Son confounds the warring Hosts  His Fate ennobling with a Croud of Ghosts  Now  Greece  gives way and great  Epigeus  falls  Agacleus'  Son from  Budium  's lofty Walls  Who chas'd for Murder thence a Suppliant came  To  Peleus  and the silverfooted Dame  Now sent to  Troy Achilles'  Arms to aid  He pays due Vengeance to his Kinsman's Shade  Soon as his luckless Hand had touch'd the Dead  A Rock's large Fragment thunder'd on his Head  Hurl'd by  Hectorean  Force it cleft in twain  His shatter'd Helm and stretch'd him o'er the Slain  Fierce to the Van of Fight  Patroclus  came  And like an Eagle darting at his Game  Sprung on the  Trojan  and the  Lycian  Band  What Grief thy Heart what Fury urg'd thy Hand  Oh gen'rous  Greek  when with full Vigour thrown  At  Stenelaus  flew the weighty Stone  Which sunk him to the dead when  Troy  too near  That Arm drew back and  Hector  learn'd to fear  Far as an able Hand a Lance can throw  Or at the Lists or at the fighting Foe  So far the  Trojans  from their Lines retir'd  Till  Glaucus'  turning all the rest inspir'd  Then  Bathyclaeus  fell beneath his Rage  The only Hope of  Chalcon  's trembling Age  Wide o'er the Land was stretch'd his large Domain  With stately Seats and Riches blest in vain  Him bold with Youth and eager to pursue  The flying  Lycians Glaucus  met and slew  Pierc'd thro' the Bosom with a sudden Wound  He fell and falling made the Fields resound  Th'  Achaians  sorrow for their Hero slain  With conqu'ring Shouts the  Trojans  shake the Plain  And crowd to spoil the Dead The  Greeks  oppose  An Iron Circle round the Carcase grows  Then brave  Laogonus  resign'd his Breath  Dispatch'd by  Merion  to the Shades of Death  On  Ida  's holy Hill he made abode  The Priest of  Jove  and honour'd like his God  Between the Jaw and Ear the Javelin went  The Soul exhaling issu'd at the vent  His Spear  Aeneas  at the Victor threw  Who stooping forward from the Death withdrew  The Lance hiss'd harmless o'er his cov'ring Shield  And trembling strook and rooted in the Field  There yet scarce spent it quivers on the Plain  Sent by the great  Aeneas'  Arm in vain  Swift as thou art the raging Hero cries  And skill'd in Dancing to dispute the Prize  My Spear the destin'd Passage had it found  Had fix'd thy active Vigour to the Ground  Oh valiant Leader of the  Dardan  Host  Insulted  Merion  thus retorts the Boast  Strong as you are 'tis mortal Force you trust  An Arm as strong may stretch thee in the Dust  And if to this my Lance thy Fate be giv'n  Vain are thy Vaunts Success is still from Heav'n  This Instant sends thee down to  Pluto  's Coast  Mine is the Glory his thy parting Ghost  O Friend  Menoetius'  Son this Answer gave  With Words to combate ill befits the Brave  Not empty Boasts the Sons of  Troy  repell  Your Swords must plunge them to the Shades of Hell  To speak beseems the Council but to dare  In glorious Action is the Task of War  This said  Patroclus  to the Battel flies  Great  Merion  follows and new Shouts arise  Shields Helmets rattle as the Warriors close  And thick and heavy sounds the Storm of Blows  As thro' the shrilling Vale or Mountain Ground  The Labours of the Woodman's Axe resound  Blows following Blows are heard reechoing wide  While crackling Forests fall on ev'ry side  Thus echo'd all the Fields with loud Alarms  So fell the Warriors and so rung their Arms  Now great  Sarpedon  on the sandy Shore  His heav'nly Form defac'd with Dust and Gore  And stuck with Darts by warring Heroes shed  Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead  His longdisputed Corpse the Chiefs inclose  On ev'ry side the busy Combate grows  Thick as beneath some Shepherd's thatch'd Abode  The Pails highfoaming with a milky Flood  The buzzing Flies a persevering Train  Incessant swarm and chas'd return again  Jove  view'd the Combate with a stern Survey  And Eyes that flash'd intolerable Day  Fix'd on the Field his Sight his Breast debates  The Vengeance due and meditates the Fates  Whether to urge their prompt Effect and call  The Force of  Hector  to  Patroclus'  Fall  This Instant see his shortliv'd Trophies won  And stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd Son  Or yet with many a Soul's untimely flight  Augment the Fame and Horror of the Fight  To crown  Achilles'  valiant Friend with Praise  At length he dooms and that his last of Days  Shall set in Glory bids him drive the Foe  Nor unattended see the Shades below  Then  Hector  's Mind he fills with dire Dismay  He mounts his Car and calls his Hosts away  Sunk with  Troy  's heavy Fates he sees decline  The Scales of  Jove  and pants with Awe divine  Then nor before the hardy  Lycians  fled  And left their Monarch with the common dead  Around in heaps on heaps a dreadful Wall  Of Carnage rises as the Heroes fall  So  Jove  decreed At length the  Greeks  obtain  The Prize contested and despoil the Slain  The radiant Arms are by  Patroclus  born  Patroclus'  Ships the glorious Spoils adorn  Then thus to  Phoebus  in the Realms above  Spoke from his Throne the Cloudcompelling  Jove  Descend my  Phoebus  on the  Phrygian  Plain  And from the Fight convey  Sarpedon  slain  Then bathe his Body in the crystal Flood  With Dust dishonour'd and deform'd with Blood  O'er all his Limbs Ambrosial Odours shed  And with celestial Robes adorn the Dead  Those Rites discharg'd his sacred Corpse bequeath  To the soft Arms of silent  Sleep  and  Death  They to his Friends the mournful Charge shall bear  His Friends a Tomb and Pyramid shall rear  What Honours Mortals after Death receive  Those unavailing Honours we may give  Apollo  bows and from Mount  Ida  's Height  Swift to the Field precipitates his Flight  Thence from the War the breathless Hero bore  Veil'd in a Cloud to silver  Simois'  Shore  There bath'd his honourable Wounds and drest  His manly Members in th' immortal Vest  And with Perfumes of sweet Ambrosial Dews  Restores his Freshness and his Form renews  Then  Sleep  and  Death  two  Twins  of winged Race  Of matchless Swiftness but of silent Pace  Receiv'd  Sarpedon  at the God's Command  And in a Moment reach'd the  Lycian  Land  The Corpse amidst his weeping Friends they laid  Where endless Honours wait the sacred Shade  Meanwhile  Patroclus  pours along the Plains  With foaming Coursers and with loosen'd Reins  Fierce on the  Trojan  and the  Lycian  Crew  Ah blind to Fate thy headlong Fury flew  Against what Fate and pow'rful  Jove  ordain  Vain was thy Friend's Command thy Courage vain  For he the God whose Counsels uncontroll'd  Dismay the mighty and confound the bold  The God who gives resumes and orders all  He urg'd thee on and urg'd thee on to fall  Who first brave Hero by that Arm was slain  Who last beneath thy Vengeance press'd the Plain  When Heav'n itself thy fatal Fury led  And call'd to fill the Number of the Dead  Adrestus  first  Autonous  then succeeds  Echeclus  follows next young  Megas  bleeds  Epistor Menalippus  bite the Ground  The Slaughter  Elasus  and  Mulius  crown'd  Then sunk  Pylartes  to eternal Night  The rest dispersing trust their Fates to Flight  Now  Troy  had stoop'd beneath his matchless Pow'r  But flaming  Phoebus  kept the sacred Tow'r  Thrice at the Battlement  Patroclus  strook  His blazing  Aegis  thrice  Apollo  shook  He try'd the fourth when bursting from the Cloud  A more than mortal Voice was heard aloud  Patroclus  cease This Heav'ndefended Wall  Defies thy Lance not fated yet to fall  Thy Friend thy greater far it shall withstand  Troy  shall not stoop ev'n to  Achilles'  Hand  So spoke the God who darts celestial Fires  The  Greek  obeys him and with Awe retires  While  Hector  checking at the  Scaean  Gates  His panting Coursers in his Breast debates  Or in the Field his Forces to employ  Or draw the Troops within the Walls of  Troy  Thus while he thought beside him  Phoebus  stood  In  Asius'  Shape who reign'd by  Sangar  's Flood  Thy Brother  Hecuba  from  Dymas  sprung  A valiant Warrior haughty bold and young  Thus he accosts him What a shameful Sight  Gods is it  Hector  that forbears the Fight  Were thine my Vigour this successful Spear  Should soon convince thee of so false a Fear  Turn then ah turn thee to the Field of Fame  And in  Patroclus'  Blood efface thy Shame  Perhaps  Apollo  shall thy Arms succeed  And Heav'n ordains him by thy Lance to bleed  So spoke th' inspiring God then took his slight  And plung'd amidst the Tumult of the Fight  He bids  Cebrion  drive the rapid Car  The Lash resounds the Coursers rush to War  The God the  Grecians  sinking Souls deprest  And pour'd swift Spirits thro' each  Trojan  Breast  Patroclus  lights impatient for the Fight  A Spear his Left a Stone employs his Right  With all his Nerves he drives it at the Foe  Pointed above and rough and gross below  The falling Ruin crush'd  Cebrion  's Head  The lawless Offspring of King  Priam  's Bed  His Front Brows Eyes one undistinguish'd Wound  The bursting Balls drop sightless to the Ground  The Charioteer while yet he held the Rein  Struck from the Car falls headlong on the Plain  To the dark Shades the Soul unwilling glides  While the proud Victor thus his Fall derides  Good Heav'ns what active Feats yon' Artist shows  What skilful Divers are our  Phrygian  Foes  Mark with what Ease they sink into the Sand  Pity that all their Practice is by Land  Then rushing sudden on his prostrate Prize  To spoil the Carcase fierce  Patroclus  flies  Swift as a Lion terrible and bold  That sweeps the Fields depopulates the Fold  Pierc'd thro' the dauntless Heart then tumbles slain  And from his fatal Courage finds his Bane  At once bold  Hector  leaping from his Car  Defends the Body and provokes the War  Thus for some slaughter'd Hind with equal Rage  Two lordly Rulers of the Wood engage  Stung with fierce Hunger each the Prey invades  And echoing Roars rebellow thro' the Shades  Stern  Hector  fastens on the Warrior's Head  And by the Foot  Patroclus  drags the Dead  While all around Confusion Rage and Fright  Mix the contending Hosts in mortal Fight  So pent by Hills the wild Winds roar aloud  In the deep Bosom of some gloomy Wood  Leaves Arms and Trees aloft in Air are blown  The broad Oaks crackle and the  Sylvans  groan  This way and that the ratt'ling Thicket bends  And the whole Forest in one Crash descends  Not with less Noise with less tumultuous Rage  In dreadful Shock the mingled Hosts engage  Darts show'r'd on Darts now round the Carcase ring  Now Flights of Arrows bounding from the String  Stones follow Stones some clatter on the Fields  Some hard and heavy shake the sounding Shields  But where the rising Whirlwind clouds the Plains  Sunk in soft Dust the mighty Chief remains  And stretch'd in Death forgets the guiding Reins  Now flaming from the  Zenith Sol  had driv'n  His fervid Orb thro' half the Vault of Heav'n  While on each Host with equal Tempest fell  The show'ring Darts and Numbers sunk to Hell  But when his Ev'ning Wheels o'erhung the Main  Glad Conquest rested on the  Grecian  Train  Then from amidst the Tumult and Alarms  They draw the conquer'd Corpse and radiant Arms  Then rash  Patroclus  with new Fury glows  And breathing Slaughter pours amid the Foes  Thrice on the Press like  Mars  himself he flew  And thrice three Heroes at each Onset slew  There ends thy Glory there the Fates untwine  The last black Remnant of so bright a Line  Apollo  dreadful stops thy middle way  Death calls and Heav'n allows no longer Day  For lo the God in dusky Clouds enshrin'd  Approaching dealt a stagg'ring Blow behind  The weighty Shock his Neck and Shoulders feel  His Eyes flash Sparkles his stunn'd Senses reel  In giddy Darkness Far to distance flung  His bounding Helmet on the Champain rung  Achilles'  Plume is stain'd with Dust and Gore  That Plume which never stoop'd to Earth before  Long us'd untouch'd in fighting Fields to shine  And shade the Temples of the Man divine  Jove  dooms it now on  Hector  's Helm to nod  Not longFor Fate pursues him and the God  His Spear in Shivers falls His ample Shield  Drops from his Arm his Baldrick strows the Field  The Corselet his astonish'd Breast forsakes  Loose is each Joint each Nerve with Horror shakes  Stupid he stares and allassistless stands  Such is the Force of more than mortal Hands  A  Dardan  Youth there was wellknown to Fame  From  Panthus  sprung  Euphorbus  was his Name  Fam'd for the Manage of the foaming Horse  Skill'd in the Dart and matchless in the Course  Full twenty Knights he tumbled from the Car  While yet he learn'd his Rudiments of War  His vent'rous Spear first drew the Hero's Gore  He strook he wounded but he durst no more  Nor tho' disarm'd  Patroclus'  Fury stood  But swift withdrew the longprotended Wood  And turn'd him short and herded in the Croud  Thus by an Arm divine and mortal Spear  Wounded at once  Patroclus  yields to fear  Retires for Succour to his social Train  And flies the Fate which Heav'n decreed in vain  Stern  Hector  as the bleeding Chief he views  Breaks thro' the Ranks and his Retreat pursues  The Lance arrests him with a mortal Wound  He falls Earth thunders and his Arms resound  With him all  Greece  was sunk that Moment all  Her yetsurviving Heroes seem'd to fall  So scorch'd with Heat along the desart Shore  The roaming Lyon meets a bristly Boar  Fast by the Spring they both dispute the Flood  With flaming Eyes and Jaws besmear'd with Blood  At length the sov'reign Savage wins the Strife  And the torn Boar resigns his Thirst and Life  Patroclus  thus so many Chiefs o'erthrown  So many Lives effus'd expires his own  As dying now at  Hector  's Feet he lies  He sternly views him and triumphing cries  Lie there  Patroclus  and with thee the Joy  Thy Pride once promis'd of subverting  Troy  The fancy'd Scenes of  Ilion  wrapt in Flames  And thy soft Pleasures serv'd with captive Dames  Unthinking Man I fought those Tow'rs to free  And guard that beauteous Race from Lords like thee  But thou a Prey to Vulturs shalt be made  The great  Achilles  cannot lend thee Aid  Tho much at parting that great Chief might say  And much enjoin thee this important Day  "Return not my brave Friend perhaps he said  "Without the bloody Arms of  Hector  dead  He spoke  Patroclus  march'd and thus he sped  Supine and wildly gazing on the Skies  With faint expiring Breath the Chief replies  Vain Boaster cease and know the Pow'rs divine  Jove  's and  Apollo  's is this Deed not thine  To Heav'n is ow'd whate'er your own you call  And Heav'n itself disarm'd me e'er my Fall  Had twenty Mortals each thy Match in Might  Oppos'd me fairly they had sunk in Fight  By Fate and  Phoebus  was I first o'erthrown  Euphorbus  next the third mean Part thy own  But thou Imperious hear my latest Breath  The Gods inspire it and it sounds thy Death  Insulting Man thou shalt be soon as I  Black Fate hangs o'er thee and thy Hour draws nigh  Ev'n now on Life's last Verge I see thee stand  I see thee fall and by  Achilles'  Hand  He faints the Soul unwilling wings her way  The beauteous Body left a Load of Clay  Flits to the lone uncomfortable Coast  A naked wand'ring melancholy Ghost  Then  Hector  pausing as his Eyes he fed  On the pale Carcase thus address'd the dead  From whence this boding Speech the stern Decree  Of Death denounc'd or why denounc'd to me  Why not as well  Achilles'  Fate be giv'n  To  Hector  's Lance Who knows the Will of Heav'n  Pensive he said then pressing as he lay  His breathless Bosom tore the Lance away  And upwards cast the Corps The reeking Spear  He shakes and charges the bold Charioteer  But swift  Automedon  with loosned Reins  Rapt in the Chariot o'er the distant Plains  Far from his Rage th' immortal Courses drove  Th' immortal Coursers were the Gift of  Jove  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Sixteenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SIXTEENTH BOOK  I  WE have at the Entrance of this Book one of the most beautiful Parts of the Iliad The two different Characters are admirably sustain'd in the Dialogue of the two Heroes wherein there is not a Period but strongly marks not only their natural Temper but that particular Disposition of Mind in either which arises from the present State of Affairs We see  Patroclus  touch'd with the deepest Compassion for the Misfortune of the  Greeks  whom the  Trojans  had forc'd to retreat to their Ships and which Ships were on the Point of burning prostrating himself before the Vessel of  Achilles  and pouring out his Tears at his Feet  Achilles  struck with the Grief of his Friend demands the Cause of it  Patroclus  pointing to the Ships where the Flames already began to rise tells him he is harder than the Rocks or Sea which lay in prospect before them if he is not touch'd with so moving a Spectacle and can see in cold Blood his Friends perishing before his Eyes As nothing can be more natural and affecting than the Speech of  Patroclus  so nothing is more lively and Picturesque than the Attitude he is here describ'd in  The  Pathetic  of  Patroclus  's Speech is finely contrasted by the  Fiertè  of that of  Achilles  While the former is melting with Sorrow for his Countrymen the utmost he can hope from the latter is but to borrow his Armour and Troops to obtain his personal Assistance he knows is impossible At the very Instant that  Achilles  is mov'd to ask the Cause of his Friend's Concern he seems to say that nothing could deserve it but the Death of their Fathers and in the same Breath speaks of the total Destruction of the  Greeks  as of too slight a Cause for Tears  Patroclus  at the opening of this Speech dares not name  Agamemnon  even for being wounded and after he has tried to bend him by all the Arguments that could affect an human Breast concludes by supposing that some Oracle or supernatual Inspiration is the Cause that withholds his Arms What can match the Fierceness of his Answer Which implies that not the Oracles of Heaven itself should be regarded if they stood in Competition with his Resentment That if he yields it must be thro' his own mere Motive The only reason he has ever to yield is that Nature itself cannot support Anger eternally And if he yields now it is only because he had before determin'd to do so at a certain time  Il  ℣ That time was not till the Flames should approach to his own Ships till the last Article of Danger and that not of Danger to  Greece  but to himself Thus his very Pity has the sternest Qualifications in the World After all what is it he yields to Only to suffer his Friend to go in his stead just to save them from present Ruin but he expressly forbids him to proceed any farther in their Assistance than barely to put out the Fires and secure his own and his Friend's Return into their Country And all this concludes with a Wish that if it were possible every  Greek  and every  Trojan  might perish except themselves Such is that  Wrath  of  Achilles  that more than Wrath as the  Greek  implies which  Homer  has painted in so strong a Colouring  II  VERSE  Indulgent to his best belov'd    The Friendship of  Achilles  and  Patroclus  is celebrated by all Antiquity And  Homer  notwithstanding the Anger of  Achilles  was his profess'd Subject has found the Secret to discover thro' that very Anger the softer Parts of his Character In this View we shall find him generous in his Temper despising Gain and Booty and as far as his Honour is not concern'd fond of his Mistress and easy to his Friend Not proud but when injur'd and not more revengeful when ill us'd than grateful and gentle when respectfully treated  "  Patroclus  says  Philostratus  who probably grounds his Assertion on some ancient Tradition was not so much elder than  Achilles  as to pretend to direct him but of a tender modest and unassuming Nature constant and diligent in his Attendance and seeming to have no Affections but those of his Friend"  The same Author has a very pretty Passage where  Ajax  is introduced enquiring of  Achilles  "Which of all his warlike Actions were the most difficult and dangerous to him He answers Those which he undertook for the sake of his Friends And which continues  Ajax  were the most pleasing and easy The very same replies  Achilles  He then asks him Which of all the Wounds he ever bore in Battel was the most painful to him  Achilles  answers That which he receiv'd from  Hector  But  Hector  says  Ajax  never gave you a Wound Yes replies  Achilles  a mortal one when he slew my Friend  Patroclus  "  It is said in the Life of  Alexander the Great  that when that Prince visited the Monuments of the Heroes at  Troy  and plac'd a Crown upon the Tomb of  Achilles  his Friend  Hephaestion  plac'd another on that of  Patroclus  as an Intimation of his being to  Alexander  what the other was to  Achilles  On which Occasion the Saying of  Alexander  is recorded  That  Achilles  was happy indeed for having had such a  Friend  to love him living and such a  Poet  to celebrate him dead  III  VERSE  No Girl no Infant  c  I know the obvious Translation of this Passage makes the Comparison consist only in the Tears of the Infant apply'd to those of  Patroclus  But certainly the Idea of the Simile will be much finer if we comprehend also in it the Mother's Fondness and Concern awaken'd by this Uneasiness of the Child which no less aptly corresponds with the Tenderness of  Achilles  on the Sight of his Friend's Affliction And there is yet a third Branch of the Comparison in the Pursuit and constant Application the Infant makes to the Mother in the same manner as  Patroclus  follows  Achilles  with his Grief till he forces him to take notice of it I think all these Circumstances laid together nothing can be more affecting or exact in all its Views than this Similitude which without that Regard has perhaps seem'd but low and trivial to an unreflecting Reader  IV  VERSE  Let  Greece  at length with Pity touch thy Breast    The Commentators labour to prove that the Words in the Original which begin this Speech    Be not angry  are not meant to desire  Achilles  to bear no farther Resentment against the  Greeks  but only not to be displeas'd at the Tears which  Patroclus  sheds for their Misfortune  Patroclus  they say was not so imprudent to begin his Intercession in that manner when there was need of something more insinuating I take this to be an Excess of Refinement The Purpose of every Period in his Speech is to persuade  Achilles  to lay aside his Anger why then may he not begin by desiring it The whole Question is whether he may speak openly in favour of the  Greeks  in the first half of the Verse or in the latter For in the same Line he represents their Distress    'Tis plain he treats him without much Reserve calls him implacable inexorable and even mischievous for  implies no less I don't see wherein the Caution of this Speech consists it is a generous unartful Petition whereof  Achilles  's Nature would much more approve than of all the Artifice of  Ulysses  to which he express'd his Hatred in the ninth Book ℣  V  VERSE  Eurypylus Tydides Atreus'  Son  And wise  Ulysses  Patroclus  in mentioning the wounded Princes to  Achilles  takes care not to put  Agamemnon  first lest that odious Name striking his Ear on a sudden should shut it against the rest of his Discourse Neither does he name him last for fear  Achilles  dwelling upon it should fall into Passion But he slides it into the middle mixing and confounding it with the rest that it might not be taken too much notice of and that the Names which precede and follow it may diminish the Hatred it might excite Wherefore he does not so much as accompany it with an Epithet  I think the foregoing Remark of  Eustathius  is very ingenious and I have given into it so far as to chuse rather to make  Patroclus  call him  Atreus'  Son than  Agamemnon  which yet farther softens it since thus it might as well be imagin'd he spoke of  Menelaus  as of  Agamemnon  VI  VERSE  And thy mere Image chase her Foes away    It is hard to conceive a greater Complement or one that could more touch the warlike Ambition of  Achilles  than this which  Homer  puts into the Mouth of  Patroclus  It was also an Encomium which he could not suspect of Flattery since the Person who made it desires to hazard his Life upon the Security that the Enemy could not support the Sight of the very Armour of  Achilles  And indeed  Achilles  himself seems to  entertain no less a Thought in the Answer to this Speech where he ascribes the Flight of  Troy  to the blazing of his Helmet a Circumstance wonderfully fine and nobly exalting the Idea of this Hero's terrible Character Besides all this  Homer  had it in his View to prepare hereby the wonderful Incident that is to ensue in the eighteenth Book where the very Sight of  Achilles  from his Ship turns the Fortune of the War  VII  VERSE  No longer flames the Lance of  Tydeus'  Son    By what  Achilles  here says joining  Diomede  to  Agamemnon  in this taunting Reflection one may justly suspect there was some particular Disagreement and Emulation between these two Heroes This we may suppose to be the more natural because  Diomede  was of all the  Greeks  confessedly the nearest in Fame and Courage to  Achilles  and therefore the most likely to move his Envy as being the most likely to supply his Place The same Sentiments are to be observ'd in  Diomede  with regard to  Achilles  he is always confident in his own Valour and therefore in their greatest Extremities he no where acknowledges the Necessity of appeasing  Achilles  but always in Council appears most forward and resolute to carry on the War without him For this reason he was not thought a fit Embassador to  Achilles  and upon Return from the Embassy he breaks into a severe Reflection not only upon  Achilles  but even upon  Agamemnon  who had sent this Embassy to him  I wish thou hadst not sent these Supplications and Gifts to  Achilles  his Insolence was extreme before but now his Arrogance will be intolerable let us not mind whether he goes or stays but do our Duty and prepare for the Battel Eustathius  observes that  Achilles  uses this particular Expression concerning  Diomede    because it was the same boasting Expression  Diomed  had apply'd  to himself  Il  ℣ But this having been said only to  Nestor  in the Heat of Fight how can we suppose  Achilles  had Notice of it This Observation shews the great Diligence if not the Judgment of the good Archbishop  VIII  VERSE  Shall render back the beauteous Maid    But this is what the  Greeks  have already offer'd to do and which he has refus'd this then is an Inequality in  Achilles  's Manners Not at all  Achilles  is still ambitious when he refused these Presents the  Greeks  were not low enough he would not receive them till they were reduced to the last Extremity and till he was sufficiently reveng'd by their Losses  Dacier  IX  VERSE  But touch not  Hector  This Injunction of  Achilles  is highly correspondent to his ambitious Character He is by no means willing that the Conquest of  Hector  should be atchiev'd by any Hand but his own In that Point of Glory he is jealous even of his dearest Friend This also wonderfully strengthens the Idea we have of his Implacability and Resentment since at the same time that nothing can move him to assist the  Greeks  in the Battel we see it is the utmost Force upon his Nature to abstain from it by the fear he manifests lest any other should subdue this Hero  The Verse I am speaking of  is cited by  Diogenes Laertius  as  Homer  's but not to be found in the Editions before that of  Barnes  It is certainly one of the Instructions of  Achilles  to  Patroclus  and therefore properly placed in this Speech but I believe better after    than where he has inserted it four Lines above For  Achilles  's Instructions not beginning till ℣  it is not so proper to divide this material one from the rest Whereas according to the Method I propose the whole Context will lie in this order  Obey my Injunctions as you consult my Interest and Honour Make as great a Slaughter of the  Trojans  as you will but abstain from  Hector  And as soon as you have repuls'd them from the Ships be satisfy'd and return For it may be fatal to pursue the Victory to the Walls of  Troy  X  VERSE  Consult my Glory and forbear    Achilles  tells  Patroclus  that if he pursues the Foe too far whether he shall be Victor or Vanquish'd it must prove either way prejudicial to his Glory For by the former the  Greeks  having no more need of  Achilles  's Aid will not render him his Captive nor try any more to appease him by Presents By the latter his Arms would be left in the Enemy's Hands and he himself upbraided with the Death of  Patroclus Dacier  XI  VERSE  Oh would to all  c  Achilles  from his overflowing Gall vents this Execration The  Trojans  he hates as professed Enemies and he detests the  Grecians  as People who had with Calmness overlook'd his Wrongs Some of the ancient Criticks not entring into the Manners of  Achilles  would have expunged this Imprecation as uttering an universal Malevolence to Mankind This Violence agrees perfectly with his implacable Character But one may observe at the same time the mighty Force of Friendship if for the sake of his dear  Patroclus  he will protect and secure those  Greeks  whose Destruction he wishes What a little qualifies this bloody  Wish is that we may suppose it spoken with great Unreservedness as in secret and between Friends  Mons  de la Motte  has a lively Remark upon the Absurdity of this Wish Upon the Supposition that  Jupiter  had granted it if all the  Trojans  and  Greeks  were destroy'd and only  Achilles  and  Patroclus  left to conquer  Troy  he asks what would be the Victory without any Enemies and the Triumph without any Spectators But the Answer is very obvious  Homer  intends to paint a Man in Passion the Wishes and Schemes of such an one are seldom conformable to Reason and the Manners are preserv'd the better the less they are represented to be so  This brings into my Mind that Curse in  Shakespear  where that admirable Master of Nature makes  Northumberland  in the Rage of his Passion wish for an universal Destruction  Now let not Nature's Hand  Keep the wild Flood confin'd Let Order die  And let the World no longer be a Stage  To feed Contention in a lingring Act  But let one Spirit of the firstborn Cain  Reign in all Bosoms that each Heart being set  On bloody Courses the rude Scene may end  And Darkness be the Burier of the Dead  XII  VERSE Ajax  no more  c  This Description of  Ajax  weary'd out with Battel is a Passage of exquisite Life and Beauty Yet what I think nobler than the Description itself is what he says at the end of it that his Hero even in this Excess of Fatigue and Languor could scarce be mov'd from his Post by the Efforts of a whole Army  Virgil  has copy'd the Description very exactly  Aen    Ergo nec clypeo juvenis subsistere tantum  Nec dextra valet injectis sic undique telis  Obruitur Strepit assiduo cava tempora circum  Tinnitu galea  saxis solida aera fatiscunt  Discussaeque jubae capiti nec sufficit umbo  Ictibus  ingeminant hastis Troes ipse  Fulmineus Mnestheus tum toto corpore sudor  Liquitur piceum nec respirare potestas  Flumen agit fessos quatit aeger anhelitus artus  The Circumstances which I have mark'd in a different Character are Improvements upon  Homer  and the last Verse excellently expresses in the short catching up of the Numbers the quick short Panting represented in the Image The Reader may add to the Comparison an Imitation of the same Place in  Tasso  Canto  St    Fatto intanto hà il Soldan cio ch'e concesso  Fare a terrena forza hor piu non puote  Tutto e sangue e sudore un grave e spesso  Anhelar gli ange il petto e i fianche scote  Langue sotto lo scudo il brachio oppresso  Gira la destra il ferro in pigre rote  Spessa e non taglia e divenendo ottuso  Perduto il brando omai di brando hà l'uso  XIII  VERSE  Great  Ajax  saw and own'd the Hand divine  Confessing  Jove  and trembling at the Sign    In the  Greek  there is added an Explication of this Sign which has no other Allusion to the Action but a very odd one in a single Phrase or Metaphor    Which may be translated  So seem'd their Hopes cut off by Heav'ns high Lord  So doom'd to fall before the  Trojan  Sword  Chapman  endeavours to account for the Meanness of this Conceit by the gross Wit of  Ajax  who seeing the Head of his Lance cut off took it into his Fancy that  Jupiter  would in the same manner cut off the Counsels and Schemes of the  Greeks  For to understand this farfetch'd Apprehension gravely as the Commentators have done is indeed to use the Words of  Chapman  most  dull and Ajantical  I believe no Man will blame me for leaving these Lines out of the Text  XIV  VERSE Achilles  view'd the rising Flames    This Event is prepar'd with a great deal of Art and Probability That Effect which a Multitude of Speeches was not able to accomplish one lamentable Spectacle the Sight of the Flames at length overcomes and moves  Achilles  to Compassion This it was say the Ancients that moved the Tragedians to make visible Representations of Misery for the Spectators beholding People in unhappy Circumstances find their Souls more deeply touch'd than by all the Strains of Rhetorick  Eustathius  XV  VERSE  He cas'd his Limbs in Brass  c  Homer  does not amuse himself here to describe these Arms of  Achilles  at length for besides that the time permits it not he reserves this Description for the new Armour which  Thetis  shall bring that Hero a Description which will be plac'd in a more quiet Moment and which will give him all the Leisure of making it without requiring any Force to introduce it  Eustathius  XVI  VERSE  Alone untouch'd  Pelides'  Javelin stands    This Passage affords another Instance of the Stupidity of the Commentators  who are here most absurdly inquisitive after the Reasons why  Patroclus  does not take the Spear as well as the other Arms of  Achilles  He thought himself a very happy Man who first found out that  Homer  had certainly given this Spear to  Patroclus  if he had not foreseen that when it should be lost in his future unfortunate Engagement  Vulcan  could not furnish  Achilles  with another being no Joiner but only a Smith  Virgil  it seems was not so precisey acquainted with  Vulcan  's Disability to profess the two Trades since he has without any scruple employed him in making a Spear as well as the other Arms for  Aeneas  Nothing is more obvious than this Thought of  Homer  who intended to raise the Idea of his Hero by giving him such a Spear as no other could wield The Description of it in this Place is wonderfully pompous  XVII  VERSE  Sprung from the Wind    It is a beautiful Invention of the Poet to represent the wonderful Swiftness of the Horses of  Achilles  by saying they were begotten by the western Wind This Fiction is truly poetical and very proper in the way of natural Allegory However it is not altogether improbable our Author might have design'd it even in the literal Sense Nor ought the Notion to be thought very extravagant in a Poet since grave Naturalists have seriously vouched the Truth of this kind of Generation Some of these relate as an undoubted Piece of natural History that there was anciently a Breed of this kind of Horses in  Portugal  whose Damms were impregnated by a western Wind  Varro Collumella  and  Pliny  are all of this Opinion I shall only mention the Words of  Pliny  Nat Hist lib cap  Constat in Lusitania circa Olyssiponem oppidum Tagum amnem equas Favonio flante obversas animalem concipere spiritum idque partum fieri gigni pernicissimum  See also the same Author  l    c    l    c  Possibly  Homer  had this Opinion in view which we see has Authority more than sufficient to give it place in Poetry  Virgil  has given us a Description of this manner of Conception  Georgic    Continuoque avidis ubi subdita flamma medullis  Vere magis quia vere calor redit ossibus illae  Ore omnes versae in Zephyrum stant rupibus altis  Exceptantque leves auras saepe sine ullis  Conjugiis vento gravidae mirabile dictu  Saxa per scopulos depressas convalles  Diffugiunt  XVIII  VERSE  Swift  Pedasus  was added to their side    Here was a necessity for a spare Horse as in another Place  Nestor  had occasion for the same that if by any Misfortune one of the other Horses should fall there might be a fresh one ready at hand to supply his Place This is good Management in the Poet to deprive  Achilles  not only of his Charioteer and his Arms but of one of his inestimable Horses  Eustathius  XIX  VERSE  Grim as voracious Wolves  c  There is scarce any Picture in  Homer  so much in the savage and terrible way as this Comparison of the  Myrmidons  to Wolves It puts one in mind of the Pieces of  Spagnolett  or  Salvator Rosa  Each Circumstance is made up of Images very strongly colour'd and horridly lively The principal Design is to represent the stern Looks and fierce Appearance of the  Myrmidons  a gaunt and ghastly Train of rawbon'd bloodyminded Fellows But besides this the Poet seems to have some farther Views in so many different Particulars of the Comparison Their eager desire of Fight is hinted at by the Wolves thirsting after Water Their Strength and Vigour for the Battel is intimated by their being fill'd with Food And as these Beasts are said to have their Thirst sharper after they are gorg'd with Prey so the  Myrmidons  are strong and vigorous with Ease and Refreshment and therefore more ardently desirous of the Combate This Image of their  Strength  is inculcated by several Expressions both in the Simile and the Application and seems design'd in contraste to the other  Greeks  who are all wasted and spent with Toil  We have a Picture much of this kind given us by  Milton lib  where  Death  is let loose into the new Creation to glut his Appetite and discharge his Rage upon all Nature  As when a Flock  Of rav'nous Fowls tho' many a League remote  Against the Day of Battel to a Field  Where Armies lie encamp'd come flying lur'd  With Scent of living Carcasses design'd  For Death the following Day in bloody Fight  So scented the grim Feature and upturn'd  His Nostril wide into the murky Air  Sagacious of his Quarry from afar  And by  Tasso  Canto  St  of the furious  Soldan  cover'd with Blood and thirsting for fresh Slaughter  Come dal chiuso ovil cacciato viene  Lupo tal' hor che fugge e si nasconde  Che se ben del gran ventre omai ripiene  Ha l' ingorde voragini profonde  Avido pur di sangue anco fuor tiene  La lingua e'l sugge da le labbra immonde  Tal' ei sen già dopo il sanguigno stratio  De la sua cupa fame anco non satio  XX  VERSE  Deriv'd from him whose Waters  c  Homer  seems resolv'd that every thing about  Achilles  shall be miraculous We have seen his very Horses are of celestial Origine and now his Commanders tho' vulgarly reputed the Sons of Men are represented as the real Offspring of some Diety The Poet thus inhances the Admiration of his chief  Hero by every Circumstance with which his Imagination could furnish him  XXI  VERSE  To her high Chamber    It was the Custom of those Times to assign the uppermost Rooms to the Women that they might be the farther remov'd from Commerce Wherefore  Penelope  in the  Odysseis  mounts up into a Garret and there sits to her Business So  Priam  in the  th  Book ℣ had Chambers for the Ladies of his Court under the Roof of his Palace  The  Lacedaemonians  call'd these high Apartments  and as the word also signifies  Eggs  'tis probable it was this that gave occasion to the Fable of  Helen  's Birth who is said to be born from an  Egg Eustathius  XXII  VERSE  And thus the God implor'd    Tho' the Character of  Achilles  every where shews a Mind sway'd with unbounded Passions and entirely regardless of all human Authority and Law yet he preserves a constant Respect to the Gods and appears as zealous in the Sentiments and Actions of Piety as any Hero of the Iliad who indeed are all remarkable this way The present Passage is an exact Description and perfect Ritual of the Ceremonies on these Occasions  Achilles  tho' an urgent Affair call'd for his Friend's Assistance would not yet suffer him to enter the Fight till in a most solemn manner he had recommended him to the Protection of  Jupiter  And this I think a stronger Proof of his Tenderness and Affection for  Patroclus  than either the Grief he express'd at his Death or the Fury he shew'd to revenge it  XXIII  VERSE Dodonaean Jove  The frequent mention of  Oracles  in  Homer  and the ancient Authors may make it not improper to give the Reader a general Account of so considerable a part of the  Grecian  Superstition which I cannot do better than in the Words of my Friend Mr  Stanyan  in his excellent and judicious Abstract of the  Grecian  History  "The  Oracles  were rank'd among the noblest and most religious kinds of Divination the Design of them being to settle such an immediate way of Converse with their Gods as to be able by them not only to explain things intricate and obscure but also to anticipate the Knowledge of future Events and that with far greater Certainty than they could hope for from Men who out of Ignorance and Prejudice must sometimes either conceal or betray the Truth So that this became the only safe way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Consequence either publick or private Whether to proclaim War or conclude a Peace to institute a new Form of Government or enact new Laws all was to be done with the Advice and Approbation of the Oracle whose Determinations were always held sacred and inviolable As to the Causes of Oracles  Jupiter  was look'd upon as the first Cause of this and all other sorts of Divination he had the Book of Fate before him and out of that reveal'd either more or less as he pleas'd to inferior Daemons But to argue more rationally this way of Access to the Gods has been branded as one of the earliest and grossest Pieces of Priestcraft that obtain'd in the World For the Priests whose Dependance was on the Oracles when they found the Cheat had got sufficient footing allow'd no Man to consult the Gods without costly Sacrifices and rich Presents to themselves And as few could bear this Expence it serv'd to raise their Credit among the common People by keeping them at an awful distance And to heighten their Esteem with the better and wealthier sort even they were only admitted upon a  few stated Days By which the thing appear'd still more mysterious and for want of this good Management must quickly have been seen through and fell to the Ground But whatever juggling there was as to the religious Part Oracles had certainly a good Effect as to the Publick being admirably suited to the Genius of a People who would join in the most desperate Expedition and admit of any Change of Government when they understood by the Oracle it was the irresistible Will of the Gods This was the Method  Minos Lycurgus  and all the famous Lawgivers took and indeed they found the People so entirely devoted to this Part of Religion that it was generally the easiest and sometimes the only way of winning them into a Compliance And then they took care to have them deliver'd in such ambiguous Terms as to admit of different Constructions according to the Exigency of the Times so that they were generally interpreted to the Advantage of the State unless sometimes there happen'd to be Bribery or Flattery in the Case as when  Demosthenes  complain'd that the  Pythia  spoke as  Philip  would have her The most numerous and of greatest Repute were the Oracles of  Apollo  who in Subordination to  Jupiter  was appointed to preside over and inspire all sorts of Prophets and Diviners And amongst these the  Delphian  challeng'd the first Place not so much in respect of its Antiquity as its Perspicuity and Certainty insomuch that the Answers of the  Tripos  came to be used proverbially for clear and infallible Truths Here we must not omit the first  Pythia  or Priestess of this famous Oracle in heroic Verse They found a secret Charm in Numbers which made every thing look pompous and weighty And hence it became the general Practice of Legislators and Philosophers to deliver their Laws and Maxims in that Dress And scarce any thing in those Ages was writ of Excellence or Moment but in Verse This was the Dawn of Poetry which soon grew into Repute and so long as it serv'd to such noble Purposes as Religion and Government Poets were highly honour'd and admitted into a Share of the Administration But by that time it arriv'd to any Perfection  they pursu'd more mean and servile Ends and as they prostituted their Muse and debased the Subject they sunk proportionably in their Esteem and Dignity As to the History of Oracles we find them mention'd in the very Infancy of  Greece  and it is as uncertain when they were finally extinct as when they began For they often lost their prophetick Faculty for some time and recover'd it again I know 'tis a common Opinion that they were universally silenc'd upon our Saviour's Appearance in the World And if the Devil had been permitted for so many Ages to delude Mankind it might probably have been so But we are assur'd from History that several of them continu'd till the Reign of  Julian  the Apostate and were consulted by him And therefore I look upon the whole Business as of human Contrivance an egregious Imposture founded upon Superstition and carry'd on by Policy and Interest till the brighter Oracles of the holy Scriptures dispell'd these Mists of Error and Enthusiasm"  XXIV  VERSE Pelasgic Dodonaean Jove  Achilles  invokes  Jupiter  with these particular Appellations and represents to him the Services perform'd by these Priests and Prophets making these Honours paid in his own Country his Claim for the Protection of the Deity  Jupiter  was look'd upon as the first Cause of all Divination and Oracles from whence he had the Appellation of    Il  ℣ The first Oracle of  Dodona  was founded by the  Pelasgi  the most ancient of all the Inhabitants of  Greece  which is confirm'd by this Verse of  Hesiod  preserv'd by the Scholiast on  Sophocles Trachin  The Oaks of this Place were said to be endu'd with Voice and prophetic Spirit the Priests who gave Answers concealing  themselves in these Trees a Practice which the pious Frauds of succeeding Ages have render'd not improbable  XXV  VERSE  Whose Groves the  Selli  Race austere  c  Homer  seems to me to say clearly enough that these Priests lay on the Ground and forbore the Bath to honour by these Austerities the God they serv'd for he says  and this  can in my Opinion only signify  for you  that is to say  to please you  and  for your Honour  This Example is remarkable but I do not think it singular and the earliest Antiquity may furnish us with the like of Pagans who by an austere Life try'd to please their Gods Nevertheless I am obliged to say that  Strabo  who speaks very much at length of these  Selli  in his  th  Book has not taken this Austerity of Life for an Effect of their Devotion but for a Remain of the Grossness of their Ancestors who being Barbarians and straying from Country to Country had no Bed but the Earth and never used a Bath But it is no way unlikely that what was in the first  Pelasgians  who founded this Oracle only Custom and Use might be continu'd by these Priests thro' Devotion How many things do we at this Day see which were in their Original only ancient Manner and which are continu'd thro' Zeal and a Spirit of Religion It is very probable that these Priests by this hard living had a mind to attract the Admiration and Confidence of a People who lov'd Luxury and Delicacy so much I was willing to search into Antiquity for the Original of these  Selli  Priests of  Jupiter  but found nothing so ancient as  Homer Herodotus  writes in his second Book that the Oracle of  Dodona  was the ancientest in  Greece  and that it was a long time the only one but what he adds that it was founded by an  Egyptian  Woman who was the Priestess of it is contradicted by this Passage of  Homer  who shews that in the time of the  Trojan  War this Temple was serv'd by Men call'd  Selli  and not by Women  Strabo  informs us of a curious ancient Tradition importing that this Temple was at first built in  Thessaly  that from thence it was carry'd into  Dodona  that several Women who had plac'd their Devotion there follow'd it and that in Process of Time the Priestesses used to be chosen from among the Descendents of those Women To return to these  Selli Sophocles  who of all the  Greek  Poets is he who has most imitated  Homer  speaks in like manner of these Priests in one of his Plays where  Hercules  says to his Son  Hillus  "I will declare to thee a new Oracle which perfectly agrees with this ancient one I my self having enter'd into the sacred Wood inhabited by the austere  Selli  who lie on the Ground writ this Answer of the Oak which is consecrated to my Father  Jupiter  and which renders his Oracles in all Languages"  Dacier  XXVI  VERSE  Homer  in this Verse uses a word which I think singular and remarkable  I cannot believe that it was put simply for  but am persuaded that this Term includes some particular Sense and shews some Custom but little known which I would willingly discover In the Scholia of  Didymus  there is this Remark  "They call'd those who serv'd in the Temple and who explain'd the Oracles render'd by the Priests  Hypothets  or  UnderProphets  "  It is certain that there were in the Temples Servitors or Subaltern Ministers who for the sake of Gain undertook to explain the Oracles which were obscure This Custom seems very well establish'd in the  Ion  of  Euripides  where that young Child after having said that the Priestess is seated on the Tripod and renders the Oracles which  Apollo  dictates to her addresses himself to those who serve in the Temple and bids them go and wash in the  Castalian  Fountain to come again into the Temple and explain the Oracles to those who should demand the Explication of them  Homer  therefore means to shew that these  Selli  were in the Temple of  Dodona  those Subaltern Ministers that interpreted the Oracles But this after all does not appear to agree with the present Passage For besides that the Custom was not establish'd in  Homer  's  Time and that there is no Footstep of it founded in that early Age these  Selli  of whom  Homer  speaks are not here Ministers subordinate to others they are plainly the chief Priests The Explication of this word therefore must be elsewhere sought and I shall offer my Conjecture which I ground upon the very Nature of this Oracle of  Dodona  which was very different from all the other Oracles In all other Temples the Priests deliver'd the Oracle which they had receiv'd from their Gods immediately But in the Temple of  Dodona Jupiter  did not utter his Oracles to his Priests but to his  Selli  he render'd them to the Oaks and the wonderful Oaks render'd them to the Priests who declared them to those who consulted them So these Priests were not properly  Prophets since they did not receive those Answers from the Mouth of their God immediately but they were  UnderProphets because they receiv'd them from the Mouth of the Oaks if I may say so The Oaks properly speaking were the Prophets the first Interpreters of  Jupiter  's Oracles and the  Selli  were  UnderProphets because they pronounc'd what the Oaks had said Thus  Homer  in one single word includes a very curious Piece of Antiquity  Dacier  XXVII  VERSE  Great  Jove  agrees to half    Virgil  has finely imitated this in his  th Aeneid  Audiit voti Phoebus succedere partem  Mente dedit partem volucres dispersit in auras  Sterneret ut subitâ turbatam morte Camillam  Annuit oranti reducem ut patria alta videret  Non dedit inque notos vocem vertêre procellae  XXVIII  VERSE  As Wasps provok'd  c  One may observe that tho'  Homer  sometimes takes his Similitudes from the  meanest and smallest things in Nature yet he orders it so as by their Appearance to signalize and give Lustre to his greatest Heroes Here he likens a Body of  Myrmidons  to a Nest of Wasps not on account of their Strength and Bravery but of their Heart and Resentment  Virgil  has imitated these humble Comparisons as when he compares the Builders of  Carthage  to Bees  Homer  has carry'd it a little farther in another Place where he compares the Soldiers to Flies for their busy Industry and Perseverance about a dead Body not diminishing his Heroes by the Size of these small Animals but raising his Comparisons from certain Properties inherent in them which deserve our Observation  Eustathius  This brings into my Mind a pretty rural Simile in  Spencer  which is very much in the Simplicity of the old Father of Poetry  As gentle Shepherd in sweet Eventide  When ruddy  Phoebus  'gins to welke in West  High on a Hill his Flock to viewen wide  Marks which do bite their hasty Supper best  A Cloud of cumb'rous Gnats do him molest  All striving to infix their feeble Stings  That from their Noyance he no whit can rest  But with his clownish Hand their tender Wings  He brusheth oft and oft doth mar their Murmurings  XXIX  VERSE  So when thick Clouds  c  All the Commentators take this Comparison in a Sense different from that in which it is here translated They suppose  Jupiter  is here described cleaving the Air with a Flash of Lightning and spreading a Gleam of Light over a high Mountain which a black Cloud held bury'd in Darkness The Application is made to  Patroclus  falling on the  Trojans  and giving Respite to the  Greeks  who were plung'd in Obscurity  Eustathius  gives this Interpretation but at the same time acknowledges it improper in this Comparison to represent the  Extinction of the Flames by the darting of Lightning This Explanation is founded solely on the Expression    Fulgurator Jupiter  which Epithet is often applied when no such Action is supposed The most obvious Signification of the Words in this Passage gives a more natural and agreeable Image and admits of a juster Application The Simile therefore seems to be of  Jupiter  dispersing a black Cloud which had cover'd a high Mountain whereby a beautiful Prospect which was before hid in Darkness suddenly appears This is applicable to the present State of the  Greeks  after  Patroclus  had extinguish'd the Flames which began to spread Clouds of Smoak over the Fleet It is  Homer  's Design in his Comparisons to apply them to the most obvious and sensible Image of the thing to be illustrated which his Commentators too frequently endeavour to hide by moral and allegorical Refinements and thus injure the Poet more by attributing to him what does not belong to him than by refusing him what is really his own  It is much the same Image with that of  Milton  in his second Book tho' apply'd in a very different way  As when from Mountain tops the dusky Clouds  Ascending while the North Wind sleeps o'er spread  Heav'ns chearful Face the low'ring Element  Scowls o'er the darkned Landskip Snow or Show'r  If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet  Extend his Evening Beam the Fields revive  The Birds their Notes renew the bleating Herds  Attest their Joy that Hill and Vally rings  XXX  VERSE Amisodarus  who  c  Amisodarus  was King of  Caria Bellerophon  marry'd his Daughter The Ancients guess'd from this Passage that the  Chimaera  was not a Fiction since  Homer  marks the Time wherein she liv'd and the Prince with whom she liv'd they thought it was some Beast of that  Prince's Herds who being grown furious and mad had done a great deal of Mischief like the  Calydonian  Boar  Eustathius  XXXI  VERSE  Yet stops and turns and saves his lov'd Allies    Homer  represents  Hector  as he retires making a stand from time to time to save his Troops And he expresses it by this single word  for  does not only signify to  stay  but likewise in retiring to stop from time to time for this is the Power of the Preposition  as in the word  which signifies to  fight by fits and starts  to  wrestle several times  and in many others  Eustathius  XXXII  VERSE  From Bank to Bank th' immortal Coursers flew  c  Homer  has made of  Hector  's Horses all that Poetry could make of common and mortal Horses they stand on the Bank of the Ditch foaming and neighing for Madness that they cannot leap it But the immortal Horses of  Achilles  find no Obstacle they leap the Ditch and fly into the Plain  Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE  As when in Autumn  Jove  his Fury pours  When guilty Mortals  c  The Poet in this Image of an Inundation takes occasion to mention a Sentiment of great Piety that such Calamities were the Effects of divine Justice punishing the Sins of Mankind This might probably refer to the Tradition of an universal Deluge which was very common among the ancient heathen Writers most of them ascribing the Cause of this Deluge to the Wrath of Heaven provoked by the Wickedness of Men  Diodorus Siculus l    c  speaking of an Earthquake and Inundation  which destroyed a great part of  Greece  in the  st Olympiad  has these Words  There was a great Dispute concerning the Cause of this Calamity The Natural Philosophers generally ascribed such Events to necessary Causes not to any divine Hand But they who had more devout Sentiments gave a more probable Account hereof asserting that it was the divine Vengeance alone that brought this Destruction upon Men who had offended the Gods with their Impiety  And then proceeds to give an Account of those Crimes which drew down this Punishment upon them  This is one among a thousand Instances of  Homer  's indirect and oblique manner of introducing moral Sentences and Instructions These agreeably break in upon his Reader even in Descriptions and poetical Parts where one naturally expects only Painting and Amusement We have Virtue put upon us by Surprize and are pleas'd to find a thing where we should never have look'd to meet with it I must do a noble  English  Poet the justice to observe that it is this particular Art that is the very distinguishing Excellence of  Cooper'sHill  throughout which the Descriptions of Places and Images rais'd by the Poet are still tending to some Hint or leading into some Reflection upon moral Life or political Institution Much in the same manner as the real Sight of such Scenes and Prospects is apt to give the Mind a compos'd Turn and incline it to Thoughts and Contemplations that have a Relation to the Object  XXXIV  VERSE  Between the Space where silver  Simois  flows  Where lay the Ships and where the Rampires rose    It looks at first Sight as if  Patroclus  was very punctual in obeying the Orders of  Achilles  when he hinders the  Trojans  from ascending to their Town and holds an Engagement with 'em between the Ships the River and the Wall But he seems afterwards from very haste to have slipt his Commands for his Orders were that he should drive 'em from the Ships and then presently return but  he proceeds farther and his Death is the Consequence  Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE  When now  Sarpedon c  The Poet preparing to recount the Death of  Sarpedon  it will not be improper to give a Sketch of some Particulars which constitute a Character the most faultless and amiable in the whole Iliad This Hero is by Birth superior to all the Chiefs of either side being the only Son of  Jupiter  engaged in this War His Qualities are no way unworthy his Descent since he every where appears equal in Valour Prudence and Eloquence to the most admired Heroes Nor are these Excellences blemish'd with any of those Defects with which the most distinguishing Characters of the Poem are stain'd So that the nicest Criticks cannot find any thing to offend their Delicacy but must be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero perfect His Valour is neither rash nor boisterous his Prudence neither timorous nor tricking and his Eloquence neither talkative nor boasting He never reproaches the living or insults the dead but appears uniform thro' his Conduct in the War acted with the same generous Sentiments that engaged him in it having no Interest in the Quarrel but to succour his Allies in Distress This noble Life is ended with a Death as glorious for in his last Moments he has no other Concern but for the Honour of his Friends and the Event of the Day  Homer  justly represents such a Character to be attended with universal Esteem As he was greatly honour'd when living he is as much lamented when dead as the chief Prop of  Troy  The Poet by his Death even before that of  Hector  prepares us to expect the Destruction of that Town when its two great Defenders are no more and in order to make it the more signal and remarkable it is the only Death in the Iliad attended with Prodigies Even his Funeral is perform'd by divine Assistance he being the only Hero whose Body is carried back to be interr'd in his native Country and honour'd with Monuments erected to his Fame These peculiar  and distinguishing Honours seem appropriated by our Author to him alone as the Reward of a Merit superior to all his other less perfect Heroes  XXXVI  VERSE  As when two Vulturs    Homer  compares  Patroclus  and  Sarpedon  to two Vulturs because they appear'd to be of equal Strength and Abilities when they had dismounted from their Chariots For this reason he has chosen to compare them to Birds of the same kind as on another occasion to image the like Equality of Strength he resembles both  Hector  and  Patroclus  to Lions But a little after this Place diminishing the Force of  Sarpedon  he compares him to a Bull and  Patroclus  to a Lion He has placed these Vulturs upon a high Rock because it is their Nature to perch there rather than in the Boughs of Trees Their crooked Talons make them unfit to walk on the Ground they could not fight steadily in the Air and therefore their fittest Place is the Rock  Eustathius  XXXVII  VERSE  Say shall I snatch him from impending Fate    It appears by this Passage that  Homer  was of Opinion that the Power of God could overrule Fate or Destiny It has puzzled many to distinguish exactly the Notion of the Heathens as to this Point Mr  Dryden  contends that  Jupiter  was limited by the Destinies or to use his Expression was no better than BookKeeper to them He grounds it upon a Passage in the tenth Book of  Virgil  where  Jupiter  mentions this Instance of  Sarpedon  as a Proof of his yielding to the Fates But both that and his Citation from  Ovid  amounts to no more than that  Jupiter  gave way to Destiny not that he could not prevent it the contrary to which is plain from his Doubt and Deliberation in this Place And indeed whatever may be inferr'd of other Poets  Homer  's Opinion at least as to the Dispensations of God to Man has ever  seem'd to me very clear and distinctly agreeable to Truth We shall find if we examine his whole Works with an Eye to this Doctrine that he assigns three Causes of all the Good and Evil that happens in this World which he takes a particular Care to distinguish First the  Will of God  superior to all    Il      Il    ℣    c  Secondly  Destiny  or  Fate  meaning the Laws and Order of Nature affecting the Constitutions of Men and disposing them to Good or Evil Prosperity or Misfortune which the supreme Being if it be his Pleasure may overrule as he is inclin'd to do in this Place but which he generally suffers to take effect Thirdly our own  Freewill  which either by Prudence overcomes those natural Influences and Passions or by Folly suffers us to fall under them  Odyss  ℣  Why charge Mankind on Heav'n their own Offence  And call their Woes the Crime of Providence  Blind who themselves their Miseries create  And perish by their Folly not their Fate  XXXVIII  VERSE  Let Sleep and Death convey by thy Command  The breathless Body to his native Land    The History or Fable received in  Homer  's Time imported that  Sarpedon  was interr'd in  Lycia  but it said nothing of his Death This gave the Poet the Liberty of making him die at  Troy  provided that after his Death he was carry'd into  Lycia  to preserve the Fable The Expedient propos'd by  Juno  solves all  Sarpedon  dies at  Troy  and is interr'd at  Lycia  and what renders this probable is that in those Times as at this Day Princes and Persons of Quality who dy'd in foreign Parts were carry'd into their own Country to be laid in the Tombs of their Fathers The Antiquity of this Custom cannot be doubted since it was practis'd in the Patriarch's Times  Jacob  dying in  Egypt  orders his Children to carry him into the Land of  Canaan  where he desir'd to be bury'd  Gen    Dacier  XXXIX  VERSE  A Show'r of Blood    As to Showers of a bloody Colour many both ancient and modern Naturalists agree in asserting the Reality of such Appearances tho' they account for 'em differently You may see a very odd Solution of 'em in  Eustathius  Note on the  th  Iliad What seems the most probable is that of  Fromondus  in his  Meteorology  who observ'd that a Shower of this kind which gave great Cause of Wonder was nothing but a Quantity of very small red Insects beat down to the Earth by a heavy Shower whereby the Ground was spotted in several Places as with Drops of Blood  XL  VERSE  Achilles'  mortal Steed  The gen'rous  Pedasus  For the other two Horses of  Achilles Xanthus  and  Balius  were mortal as we have already seen in this Book 'Tis a merry Conceit of  Eustathius  that  Pedasus  is only said to be mortal because of the three Horses he only was a Gelding 'Tis pity poor  Pedasus  had not a better Fate to have recompensed the Loss of his Immortality  XLI  VERSE Glaucus  be bold  c  This dying Speech of  Sarpedon  deserves particular Notice being made up of noble Sentiments and fully answering the Character of this brave and generous Prince which he preserves in his last Moments Being sensible of approaching Death without any Transports of Rage or Desire of Revenge he calls to his Friend to take care to preserve his Body and Arms from becoming a Prey to the Enemy And this he says without any regard to himself but out of the most tender Concern for his Friend's Reputation who must for ever become infamous if he fails in this Point of Honour and Duty If we conceive this said by the expiring Hero his dying Looks fix'd on his wounded disconsolate Friend the Spear remaining in his Body and the Victor standing by in a kind of Extasy surveying his Conquest these Circumstances will form a very moving Picture  Patroclus  all this time either out of Humanity or Surprize omits to pull out the Spear which however he does not long forbear but with it drawing forth his Vitals puts a Period to this gallant Life  XLII  VERSE  pierc'd with Pain  That thrils my Arm and shoots thro' ev'ry Vein    There seems to be an Oversight in this Place  Glaucus  in the twelfth Book had been wounded with an Arrow by  Teucer  at the Attack of the Wall and here so long after we find him still on the Field  in the sharpest Anguish of his Wound the Blood not being yet stanch'd  c In the Speech that next follows to  Hector  there is also something liable to Censure when he imputes to the Negligence of the  Trojans  the Death of  Sarpedon  of which they knew nothing till that very Speech inform'd 'em I beg leave to pass over these things without exposing or defending them tho' such as these may be sufficient Grounds for a most inveterate War among the Criticks  XLIII  VERSE  Great  Jove  O'er the fierce Armies pours pernicious Night    Homer  calls here by the Name of Night the Whirlwinds of thick Dust which rise from beneath the Feet of the Combatants and which hinders them from knowing one another Thus Poetry knows how to convert the most natural things into Miracles these two Armies are bury'd in Dust round  Sarpedon  's Body 'tis  Jupiter  who pours upon them an obscure Night to make the Battel bloodier and to honour the Funeral of his Son by a greater Number of Victims  Eustathius  XLIV  VERSE  And skill'd in Dancing    This Stroke of Raillery upon  Meriones  is founded on the Custom of his Country For the  Cretans  were peculiarly addicted to this Exercise and in particular are said to have invented the  Pyrrhic  Dance which was perform'd in compleat Armour See the forty sixth Note on the thirteenth Book  XLV  VERSE  Then Sleep and Death  c  It is the Notion of  Eustathius  that by this Interment of  Sarpedon  where  Sleep  and  Death  are concern'd  Homer  seems to intimate that there was nothing else but an empty Monument of that Hero in  Lycia  for he delivers him not to any real or solid Persons but to certain unsubstantial Phantoms to conduct his Body thither He was forced continues my Author to make use of these Machines since there were no other Deities he could with any likelihood employ about this Work for the Ancients as appears from  Euripides Hippolyto  had a Superstition that all dead Bodies were offensive to the Gods they being  of a Nature celestial and uncorruptible But this last Remark is impertinent since we see in this very Place  Apollo  is employ'd in adorning and embalming the Body of  Sarpedon  What I think better accounts for the Passage is what  Philostratus in Heroicis  affirms that this alludes to a Piece of Antiquity  "The  Lycians  shew'd the Body of  Sarpedon  strew'd over with Aromatical Spices in such a graceful Composure that he seem'd to be only asleep And it was this that gave Rise to the Fiction of  Homer  that his Rites were perform'd by  Sleep  and  Death  "  But after all these refin'd Observations it is probable the Poet intended only to represent the Death of this favourite Son of  Jupiter  and one of his most amiable Characters in a gentle and agreeable View without any Circumstances of Dread or Horror intimating by this Fiction that he was delivered out of all the Tumults and Miseries of Life by two imaginary Deities  Sleep  and  Death  who alone can give Mankind Ease and Exemption from their Misfortunes  XLVI  VERSE  Who first brave Hero  c  The Poet in a very moving and solemn way turns his Discourse to  Patroclus  He does not accost his Muse as it is usual with him to do but enquires of the Hero himself who was the first and who the last who fell by his Hand This Address distinguishes and signalizes  Patroclus  to whom  Homer  uses it more frequently than I remember on any other occasion as if he was some Genius or divine Being and at the same time it is very pathetical and apt to move our Compassion The same kind of Apostrophe is used by  Virgil  to  Camilla  Quem telo primum quem postremum aspera virgo  Dejicis Aut quot humi morientia corpora fundis  XLVII  VERSE  What skilful Divers  c  The Original is literally thus  'Tis pity he is not nearer the Sea he would  furnish good Quantities of excellent Oisters and the Storms would not frighten him see how he exercises and plunges from the Top of his Chariot into the Plain Who would think that there were such good Divers at  Troy This seems to be a little too long and if this Passage be really  Homer  's I could almost swear that he intended to let us know that a good Soldier may be an indifferent Jester But I very much doubt whether this Passage be his It is very likely these five last Verses were added by some of the ancient Criticks whose Caprices  Homer  has frequently undergone or perhaps some of the Rhapsodists who in reciting his Verses made Additions of their own to please their Auditors And what persuades me of its being so is that 'tis by no means probable that  Patroclus  who had lately blam'd  Meriones  for his little Raillery against  Aeneas  and told him  "that 'twas not by Raillery or Invective that they were to repel the  Trojans  but by Dint of Blows that Council requir'd Words but War Deeds"  It is by no means probable I say that the same  Patroclus  should forget that excellent Precept and amuse himself with Raillery especially in the Sight of  Hector  I am therefore of Opinion that  Patroclus  said no more than this Verse  c  Good Gods what an active  Trojan  it is and how cleverly he dives  and that the five following are Strangers tho' very ancient  Dacier  I must just take notice that however mean or ill placed these Railleries may appear there have not been wanting such fond Lovers of  Homer  as have admir'd and imitated 'em  Milton  himself is of this Number as may be seen from those very low Jests which he has put into the Mouth of  Satan  and his Angels in the  th  Book What  Aeneas  says to  Meriones  upon his Dancing is nothing so trivial as those Lines where after the Displosion of their Diabolical Enginry Angel rowling on Archangel they are thus derided  When we propounded Terms  Of Composition strait they chang'd their Minds  Flew off and into strange Vagaries fell  As they would dance yet for a Dance they seem'd  Somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps  For joy of offer'd Peace  c  Terms that amus'd 'em all  And stumbled many who receives them right  Had need from Head to Foot well understand  Not understood this Gift they have besides  They show us when our Foes walk not upright  XLVIII  VERSE Apollo  dreadful  c  If  Homer  is resolv'd to do any thing extraordinary or arbitrary which his Readers may not very well relish he takes care however to prepare them by degrees for receiving such Innovations He had before given us a Sketch of this Trick of the Gods in the  th  Book where  Neptune  serves  Alcathous  much in the same manner  Apollo  here carries it a little farther and both these are Specimens of what we are to expect from  Minerva  at the Death of  Hector  in  Il    XLIX  VERSE  Lie there  Patroclus c  There is much Spirit in this Sarcasm of  Hector  upon  Patroclus  Nor is  Achilles  exempt from the Severity of the Reflection who as he imagines had persuaded his dearest Friend to attempt Exploits that were impracticable He touches him also for staying at home in Security himself and encouraging  Patroclus  to undertake this perillous Adventure and to seek after Spoils which he was never like to enjoy  Eustathius  L  VERSE  Hear my latest Breath  The Gods inspire in    It is an Opinion of great Antiquity that when the Soul is  on the point of being delivered from the Body and makes a nearer Approach to the divine Nature at such a time its Views are stronger and clearer and the Mind endow'd with a Spirit of true Prediction So  Artemon  of  Miletum  says in his Book of Dreams that when the Soul hath collected all its Powers from every Limb and Part of the Body and is just ready to be severed from it at that time it becomes Prophetical  Socrates  also in his Defence to the  Athenians  "I am now arrived at the Verge of Life wherein it is familiar with People to foretell what will come to pass"  Eustathius  This Opinion seems alluded to in those admirable Lines of  Waller  Leaving the old both Worlds at once they view  Who stand upon the Threshold of the new  LI  VERSE  The Death of  Patroclus  I sometimes think I am in respect to  Homer  much like  Sancho Panca  with regard to  Don Quixote  I believe upon the whole that no Mortal ever came near him for Wisdom Learning and all good Qualities But sometimes there are certain Starts which I cannot tell what to make of and am forced to own that my Master is a little out of the way if not quite besides himself The present Passage of the Death of  Patroclus  attended with so many odd Circumstances to overthrow this Hero who might for all I can see as decently have fallen by the Force of  Hector  are what I am at a loss to excuse and must indeed in my own Opinion give them up to the Criticks I really think almost all those Parts which have been objected against with most Clamour and Fury are honestly defensible and none of 'em to confess my private Sentiment seem to me to be Faults of any Consideration except this Conduct in the Death of  Patroclus  the Length of  Nestor  's Discourse in  Lib  the Speech of  Achilles  's Horse in the  th  the Conversation of that Hero with  Aeneas  in  Lib  the manner of  Hector  's Flight round  the Walls of  Troy  and his Death in  Lib  I hope after so free a Confession no reasonable Modern will think me touch'd with the  of Madam  Dacier  and others I am sensible of the Extremes which Mankind run into in extolling and depreciating Authors We are not more violent and unreasonable in attacking those who are not yet establish'd into Fame than in defending those who are even in every minute Trifle Fame is a Debt which when we have kept from People as long as we can we pay with a prodigious Interest which amounts to twice the Value of the Principal Thus 'tis with ancient Works as with ancient Coins they pass for a vast deal more than they were worth at first and the very Obscurities and Deformities which Time has thrown upon them are the sacred Rust which enhances their Value with all true Lovers of Antiquity  But as I have own'd what seem my Author's Faults and subscrib'd to the Opinion of  Horace  that  Homer  sometimes nods I think I ought to add that of  Longinus  as to such Negligences I can no way so well conclude the Notes to this Book as with the Translation of it  "It may not be improper to discuss the Question in general which of the two is the more estimable a faulty Sublime or a faultless Mediocrity And consequently if of two Works one has the greater Number of Beauties and the other attains directly to the Sublime which of these shall in Equity carry the Prize I am really persuaded that the true Sublime is incapable of that Purity which we find in Compositions of a lower Strain and in effect that too much Accuracy sinks the Spirit of an Author whereas the Case is generally the same with the Favourites of Nature and those of Fortune who with the best Oeconomy cannot in the great Abundance they are blest with attend to the minuter Articles of their Expence Writers of a cool Imagination are cautious in their Management and venture nothing merely to gain the Character of being correct but the Sublime is bold and enterprizing notwithstanding that on every Advance the Danger encreaseth Here probably some will say that Men take a malicious Satisfaction in exposing the Blemishes of an Author that his  Errors are never forgot while the most exquisite Beauties leave but very imperfect Traces on the Memory To obviate this Objection I will solemnly declare that in my Criticisms on  Homer  and other Authors who are universally allow'd to be authentic Standards of the Sublime tho' I have censur'd their Failings with as much Freedom as any one yet I have not presum'd to accuse them of voluntary Faults but have gently remark'd some little Defects and Negligences which the Mind being intent on nobler Ideas did not condescend to regard And on these Principles I will venture to lay it down for a Maxim that the Sublime purely on account of its Grandeur is preferable to all other kinds of Style however it may fall into some Inequalities The Argonauticks of  Apollonius  are faultless in their kind and  Theocritus  hath shewn the happiest Vein imaginable for Pastorals excepting those in which he has deviated from the Country And yet if it were put to your Choice would you have your Name descend to Posterity with the Reputation of either of those Poets rather than with that of  Homer  Nothing can be more correct than the  Erigone  of  Eratosthenes  but is he therefore a greater Poet than  Archilochus  in whose Composures Perspicuity and Order are often wanting the divine Fury of his Genius being too impatient for Restraint and superior to Law Again do you prefer the Odes of  Bacchilides  to  Pindar  's or the Scenes of  Ion  of  Chios  to those of  Sophocles  Their Writings are allow'd to be correct polite and delicate whereas on the other Hand  Pindar  and  Sophocles  sometimes hurry on with the greatest Impetuosity and like a devouring Flame seize and set on Fire whatever comes in their way but on a sudden the Conflagration is extinguish'd and they most miserably flag when no body expects it Yet none have so little Discernment as not to prefer the single  Oedipus  of  Sophocles  to all the Tragedies that  Ion  ever brought on the Stage  "In our Decisions therefore on the Characters of these great Men who have illustrated what is useful and necessary with all the Graces and Elevation of Style we must impartially confess that with all their Errors they have  more Perfections than the Nature of Man can almost be conceiv'd capable of attaining For 'tis merely human to excell in other kinds of Writing but the Sublime ennobleth our Nature and makes near Approaches to Divinity He who commits no Faults is barely read without Censure but a Genius truly great excites Admiration In short the Magnificence of a single Period in one of these admirable Authors is sufficient to attone for all their Defects Nay farther if any one should collect from  Homer Demosthenes Plato  and other celebrated Heroes of Antiquity the little Errors that have escap'd them they would not bear the least Proportion to the infinite Beauties to be met with in every Page of their Writings 'Tis on this account that Envy thro' so many Ages hath never been able to wrest from them the Prize of Eloquence whichtheir Merits have so justly acquir'd An Acquisition which they still are and will in all Probability continue possess'd of  As long as Streams in silver Mazes rove  Or Spring with annual Green renews the Grove  Mr FENTON  FINIS
