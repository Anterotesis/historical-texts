 OF THE USE of RICHES  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honorable  ALLEN  Lord  BATHURST  By Mr POPE  LONDON  Printed by  J Wright  for LAWTON GILLIVER at  Homer  's  Head  against  St Dunstan's Church  in  Fleetstreet  Price  s  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honorable  ALLEN  Lord  BATHURST  WHO shall decide when Doctors disagree  And soundest Casuists doubt like you and me  You hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n  That Man was made the standing Jest of Heav'n  And Gold but sent to keep the Fools in play  For half to heap and half to throw away  But I who think more highly of our Kind  And surely Heav'n and I are of a mind  Opine that Nature as in duty bound  Deep hid the shining Mischief under ground  But when by Man's audacious Labor won  Flam'd forth this Rival to its Sire the Sun  Then in plain prose were made two sorts of men  To squander some and some to hide agen  Like Doctors thus when much Dispute has past  We find our Tenets just the same at last  Both fairly owning Riches in effect  No Grace of Heav'n or Token of th' Elect  Giv'n to the Fool the Mad the Vain the Evil  To W  rd to W  t  rs Ch  rs and the Devil  What Nature wants commodious Gold bestows  'Tis thus we eat the bread another sows  But how unequal it bestows observe  'Tis thus we riot while who sow it starve  What Nature wants a phrase I much distrust  Extends to Luxury extends to Lust  And if we count among the Needs of life  Another's Toil why not another's Wife  Useful we grant it serves what life requires  But dreadful too the dark Assassin hires  Trade it may help Society extend  But lures the Pyrate and corrupts the Friend  It raises Armies in a nation's aid  But bribes a Senate and the Land's betray'd  Oh that such Bulky bribes as all might  see  Still as of old encumber'd Villainy  In vain may Heroes fight and Patriots rave  If secret Gold saps on from knave to knave  Could France or Rome divert our brave designs  With all their brandies or with all their wines  What could they more than knights and squires confound  Or water all the Quorum ten miles round  A statesman's slumbers how this speech would spoil  " Sir Spain has sent a thousand jars of oyl  " Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door  " A hundred Oxen at your levee roar  Poor Avarice one torment more would find  Nor could Profusion squander all in kind  Astride his Cheese Sir Morgan might we meet  And Worldly crying Coals from street to street  Whom with a Wig so wild and Mien so maz'd  Pity mistakes for some poor Tradesman craz'd  Had H  wl  y's fortune layn in Hops and Hogs  Scarce H  wl  y's self had sent it to the dogs  His Grace will game to White's a Bull be led  With spurning heels and with a butting head  To White's be carry'd as to ancient Games  Fair Coursers Vases and alluring Dames  Shall then Uxorio if the stakes he sweep  Bear home six Whores and make his Lady weep  Or soft Adonis so perfum'd and fine  Drive to St James's a whole herd of Swine  Oh filthy Check on all industrious skill  To spoil the Nation's last great Trade Quadrille  Once we confess beneath the Patriot's cloak  Beneath the Patriot's Cloak  This is a true Story which happen'd in the Reign of King William to an eminent unsuspected old Patriot who coming out at the Backdoor from having been closeted by the King where he had received a large Bag or Guineas the Bursting of the Bag discover'd his Business there  From the crack'd bagg the dropping Guinea spoke  And gingling down the backstairs told the Crew  " Old Cato is as great a Rogue as you"  Blest Papercredit that advanc'd so high  Shall lend Corruption lighter wings to fly  Gold imp'd with this may compass hardest things  May pocket States or fetch or carry Kings  A single Leaf may waft an Army o'er  Or ship off Senates to some distant shore  A Leaf like Sybil's scatter to and fro  Our Fates and Fortunes as the winds shall blow  Well then since with the world we stand or fall  Come take it as we find it Gold and all  What Riches give us let us first enquire  Meat fire and cloaths what more Meat cloaths and fire  Is this too little wou'd you more than live  Alas 'tis more than Tu * * r finds they give  Alas 'tis more than all his Visions past  Unhappy Wh * * n waking found at last  What can they give to dying  A Citizen whose Rapacity obtain'd him the Name of Vultur He dy'd worth three hundred thousand Pounds and left it to no Person living but to the first Son that should be born of the first Daughter of his next Relation Being told by his Lawyer that it would probably be thirty Years before his Money could

alias Sir Peter Stranger was punish'd with the Loss of those Parts for having forg'd a Conveyance of an Estate to himself upon which he took up several Thousand Pounds He was at the same time sued in Chancery on suggestion of having fraudulently obtain'd a Will by which he possest another very considerable Estate in wrong of the Brother of the Deceas'd  Can they in Gems bid pallid Hippia glow  In Fulvia's Buckle ease the Throbs below  Or heal old Narses thy obscener ail  With all th' Embroid'ry plaister'd at thy Tail  They might were Harpax not too wise to spend  Give Harpax self the Blessing of a Friend  Or find some Doctor that wou'd save the Life  Of wretched Shylock spite of Shylock's Wife  But thousands die without or this or that  Die and endow a College or a  A famous Dutchess in her last Will left considerable Annuities and Legacies to her Cats  Cat  To some indeed Heav'n grants the happier Fate  T'enrich a Bastard or a Son they hate  Perhaps you think the Poor might have their part  B*nd damns the Poor and hates them from his heart  The grave Sir G * * t holds it for a Rule  That every Man in want is Knave or Fool  " God cannot love says Bl * t with lifted eyes  " The Wretch he starves"and piously denies  But Rev'rend S * * n with a softer Air  Admits and leaves them Providence's Care  Yet to be just to these poor Men of Pelf  Each does but hate his Neighbour as himself  Damn'd to the Mines an equal Fate betides  The Slave that digs it and the Slave that hides  Who suffer thus meer Charity should own  Must act on Reasons pow'rful tho' unknown  Some War some Plague some Famine they foresee  Some Revelation hid from you and me  Why S  l  k wants a Meal the cause is found  He thinks a Loaf will rise to fifty pound  What made Directors cheat in SouthSea year  To live on Ven'son when it sold so dear  In the Extravagance and Luxury of the SouthSea Year the Price of a Haunch of Venison was from three to five pounds  Ask you why Phryne the whole Auction buys  Phryne foresees a General Excise  Why she and Lesbia raise that monstrous Sum  Alas they fear a Man will cost a Plum  Wise Peter sees the World's respect for Gold  And therefore hopes this Nation may

Muchinjur'd Bl  t why bears he Britain's hate  A Wizard told him in these words our fate  " At length Corruption like a gen'ral Flood  " So long by watchful Ministers withstood  " Shall deluge all and Av'rice creeping on  " Spread like a lowborn Mist and blot the Sun  " Statesman and Patriot ply alike the Stocks  " Peeress and Butler share alike the Box  " The Judge shall job the Bishop bite the Town  " And mighty Dukes pack Cards for half a crown  " See Britain sunk in Lucre's sordid charms  " And France reveng'd of Anne's and Edward's Arms  No poor CourtBadge great Scriv'ner fir'd thy brain  No Lordly Luxury no City Gain  But 'twas thy righteous End asham'd to see  Senates degen'rate Patriots disagree  And nobly wishing Party Rage to cease  To buy both Sides and give thy Country Peace  " All this is madness cries a sober Sage  But who my Friend has Reason in his Rage  The ruling Passion be it what it will  The ruling Passion conquers Reason still  Less mad the wildest Whimsey we can frame  Than ev'n that Passion if it has no Aim  For tho' such Motives Folly you may call  The Folly's greater to have none at all  Hear then the truth 'Tis Heav'n each Passion sends  And diff'rent Men directs to diff'rent Ends  " Extremes in Nature equal Good produce  " Extremes in Man concur to general Use  Ask we what makes one keep and one bestow  That Pow'r who bids the Ocean ebb and flow  Bids Seedtime Harvest equal course maintain  Thro' reconcil'd Extremes of Drought and Rain  Builds Life on Death on Change Duration founds  And gives th' eternal Wheels to know their rounds  Riches like Insects when conceal'd they lie  Wait but for Wings and in their Season fly  Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst his Store  Sees but a backward Steward for the Poor  This Year a Reservoir to keep and spare  The next a Fountain spouting thro' his Heir  In lavish Streams to quench a Country's thirst  And Men and Dogs shall drink him till they burst  Old Cotta sham'd his fortune and his birth  Yet was not Cotta void of wit or worth  What tho' the use of barb'rous Spits forgot  His Kitchen vy'd in coolness with his Grot  His Court with Nettles Moat with Cresses stor'd  With Soups unbought and Sallads blest his board  If Cotta liv'd on Pulse it was no more  Than Bramins Saints and Sages did before  To cram the Rich was prodigal expence  And who would take the Poor from Providence  Like some lone Chartreuse stands the good old Hall  Silence without and Fasts within the wall  No rafter'd Roofs with Dance and Tabor sound  No Noontidebell invites the Country round  Tenants with sighs the smoakless Tow'rs survey  And turn th' unwilling Steeds another way  Benighted wanderers the Forest o'er  Curse the sav'd Candle and unopening Door  While the gaunt Mastiff growling at the Gate  Affrights the Begger whom he longs to eat  Not so his Son he mark'd this oversight  And then mistook reverse of wrong for right  For what to shun will no great knowledge need  But what to follow is a task indeed  What slaughter'd Hecatombs what floods of wine  Fill the capacious Squire and deep Divine  Yet no mean motive this profusion draws  His Oxen perish in his Country's cause  'Tis the dear Prince Sir John that crowns thy cup  And Zeal for his great House that eats thee up  The woods recede around the naked seat  The sylvans groanno matter"for the Fleet"  Next goes his wool"to clothe our valiant bands"  Last for his country's love he sells his lands  Bankrupt at Court in vain he pleads his cause  His thankless Country leaves him to her Laws  The Sense to value Riches with the Art  T'enjoy them and the Virtue to impart  Not meanly nor ambitiously persu'd  Not sunk by sloth nor rais'd by servitude  To balance Fortune by a just expence  Joyn with Oeconomy Magnificence  With Splendor Charity with Plenty Health  Oh teach us BATHURST yet unspoil'd by wealth  That secret rare between th' extremes to move  Of mad Good nature and of mean Selflove  To want or worth wellweigh'd be bounty given  And ease or emulate the care of Heaven  Whose measure full o'erflows on human race  Mends Fortune's fault and justifies her grace  Wealth in the gross is Death but Life diffus'd  As Poyson heals in just proportion us'd  In heaps like Ambergrise a stink it lies  But well dispers'd is Incense to the skies  Who starves by Nobles or with Nobles eats  The wretch that trusts them and the rogue that cheats  Is there a Lord who knows a chearful noon  Without a Fidler Flatt'rer or Buffoon  Whose Table Wit or modest Merit share  Unelbow'd by a Gamester Pimp or Play'r  Who copies Yours or OXFORD's better part  To ease th' oppress'd and raise the sinking heart  Wheree'er he shines oh Fortune gild the scene  And Angels guard him in the golden Mean  There English Bounty yet a while may stand  And Honor linger e're it leaves the Land  But all our praises why should Lords engross  Rise honest Muse and sing the Man of Ross  Pleas'd Vaga ecchoes thro' her winding bounds  And rapid Severn hoarse applause resounds  Who hung with woods  on mountains sultry brow  From the dry rock who bade the waters flow  Not to the skies in useless columns tost  Or in proud falls magnificently lost  But clear and artless pouring thro' the plain  Health to the sick and solace to the swain  Whose Causeway parts the vale with shady rows  Whose Seats the weary Traveller repose  Who feeds yon Almshouse neat but void of state  Where Age and Want sit smiling at the gate  Who taught that heav'ndirected Spire to rise  The Man of Ross each lisping babe replies  Behold the marketplace with poor o'erspread  The Man of Ross divides the weekly bread  Him portion'd maids apprentic'd orphans blest  The young who labour and the old who rest  Is any sick the Man of Ross relieves  Prescribes attends the med'cine makes and gives  Is there a variance enter but his door  Balk'd are the courts and contest is no more  Despairing Quacks with curses fled the place  And vile Attornies now an useless race  " Thrice happy man enabled to persue  " What all so wish but want the pow'r to do  " Oh say what sums that gen'rous hand supply  " What mines to swell that boundless Charity  Of debts and taxes wife and children clear  This man possestfive hundred pounds a year  This Person who with no greater Estate perform'd all these good Works and whose true Name was almost lost partly by having the Title of the  Man of R  given him by way of Eminence and partly by being buried without any Inscription was called Mr  John Kyrle  He died in the Year aged near and lies buried in the Chancel of the Church of Ross in Herefordshire  Blush Grandeur blush proud Courts withdraw your blaze  Ye little  Stars  hide your diminish'd rays  " And what no Monument Inscription Stone  " His Race his Form his Name almost unknown  Who builds a Church to God and not to Fame  Will never mark the marble with his name  Go search it there  The ParishRegister  where to be born and die  Of Rich and Poor makes all the history  Enough that Virtue fill'd the space between  Prov'd by the Ends of Being to have been  When H * p * s dies a thousand Lights attend  The Wretch who living sav'd a Candle's end  Should'ring God's altar a vile Image stands  Belies his features nay extends his hands  That livelong Wig which Gorgon's self might own  Eternal buckle takes in Parian stone  Behold what blessings Wealth to Life can lend  And see what comfort it affords our End  In the worst Inn's worst room with matt halfhung  The floors of plaister and the walls of dung  On once a flockbed but repair'd with straw  With tapety'd curtains never meant to draw  The George and Garter dangling from that bed  Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red  Great Villers liesalas how chang'd from him  That Life of Pleasure and that Soul of Whym  Gallant and gay in Cliveden's proud alcove  The Bow'r of wanton Sh * * * y and Love  Or just as gay at Council in a ring  Of mimick'd Statesmen and the merry King  No Wit to flatter left of all his store  No Fool to laugh at which he valued more  There Victor of his health of fortune friends  And fame this Lord of useless thousands ends  His Grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee  And well he thought advis'd him "Live like me"  As well his Grace reply'd "Like you Sir John  " That I can do when all I have is gone"  Resolve me Reason which of these is worse  Want with a full or with an empty purse  Thy Life more wretched Cutler was confess'd  Arise and tell me was thy Death more bless'd  Cutler saw Tenants break and houses fall  For very want he could not build a wall  His only Daughter in a Stranger's Pow'r  For very want he could not pay a Dow'r  A few grey hairs his rev'rend temples crown'd  'Twas very want that sold them for two pound  What ev'n deny'd a cordial at his end  Banish'd the Doctor and expell'd the friend  What but a want which you perhaps think mad  Yet numbers feel the want of what he had  Cutler and Brutus dying both exclaim  " Virtue and Wealth what are ye but a Name"  Say for such worth are other worlds prepar'd  Or are they both in this their own reward  That knotty point my Lord shall I discuss  Or tell a TaleA Taleit follows thus  Where  The Monument built in Memory of the Fire of London with an Inscription importing that City to have been burn'd by the Papists  London's Column pointing at the skies  Like a tall  Bully lifts the head and lyes  There dwelt a Citizen of sober fame  A plain good man and Balaam was his name  Religious punctual frugal and so forth  His word would pass for more than he was worth  One solid dish his weekday meal affords  An added pudding solemniz'd the Lord's  Constant at Church and Change his gains were sure  His givings rare save farthings to the poor  The Dev'l was piqu'd such saintship to behold  And long'd to tempt him like good Job of old  But Satan now is wiser than of yore  And tempts by making rich not making poor  Rouz'd by the Prince of Air the whirlwinds sweep  The surge and plunge his Father in the deep  Then full against his Cornish lands they roar  And two rich Shipwrecks bless the lucky shore  Sir Balaam now he lives like other folks  He takes his chirping pint he cracks his jokes  " Live like your self" was soon my Lady's word  And lo two puddings smok'd upon the board  Asleep and naked as an Indian lay  An honest Factor stole a Gem away  He pledg'd it to the Knight the Knight had wit  So kept the Diamond and the Rogue was bit  Some Scruple rose but thus he eas'd his thought  " I'll now give sixpence where I gave a groat  " Where once I went to church I'll now go twice  " And am so clear too of all other Vice"  The Tempter saw his time the work he ply'd  Stocks and Subscriptions pour on ev'ry side  And all the Daemon makes his full descent  In one abundant Show'r of  Cent per Cent  Sinks deep within him and possesses whole  Then dubs  Director  and secures his Soul  Behold Sir Balaam now a man of spirit  Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit  What late he call'd a Blessing now was Wit  And God's good providence a lucky Hit  Things change their titles as our manners turn  His Comptinghouse imploy'd the Sundaymorn  Seldom at church 'twas such a busy life  But duly sent his family and wife  There so the Dev'l ordain'd one Christmastide  My good old Lady catch'd a cold and dy'd  A Nymph of Quality admires our Knight  He marries bows at Court and grows polite  Leaves the dull Cits and joins to please the fair  The wellbred Cuckolds in St James's air  First for his son a gay commission buys  Who drinks whores fights and in a duel dies  His daughter flaunts a Viscount's tawdry wife  She bears a Coronet and P  x for life  In Britain's Senate he a seat obtains  And one more Pensioner St Stephen gains  My Lady falls to Play so bad her chance  He must repair it takes a bribe from France  The House impeach him Co * * by harangues  The Court forsakes him and Sir Balaam hangs  Wife son and daughter Satan are thy prize  And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies  P Ver for ypon read yon
