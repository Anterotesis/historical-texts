 A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN WITH STRICTURES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS  BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT  LONDON PRINTED FOR J JOHNSON N  o  ST PAUL'S CHURCH YARD    TO M TALLEYRANDPÃ‰RIGORD LATE BISHOP OF AUTUN  SIR  HAVING read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published on National Education I dedicate this volume to youthe first dedication that I have ever written to induce you to read it with attention and because I think that you will understand me which I do not suppose many pert witlings will who may ridicule the arguments they are unable to answer But Sir I carry my respect for your understanding still farther so far that I am confident  you will not throw my work aside and hastily conclude that I am in the wrong because you did not view the subject in the same light yourselfAnd pardon my frankness but I must observe that you treated it in too cursory a manner contented to consider it as it had been considered formerly when the rights of man not to advert to woman were trampled on as chimericalI call upon you therefore now to weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national educationand I call with the firm tone of humanity For my arguments Sir are dictated by a disinterested spiritI plead for my sex not for myself Independence I have long considered as the grand blessing of life the basis of every virtueand independence I will ever secure by contracting my wants though I were to live on a barren heath  It is then an affection for the whole human race that makes my pen dart rapidly  along to support what I believe to be the cause of virtue and the same motive leads me earnestly to wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would advance instead of retarding the progress of those glorious principles that give a substance to morality My opinion indeed respecting the rights and duties of woman seems to flow so naturally from these simple principles that I think it scarcely possible but that some of the enlarged minds who formed your admirable constitution will coincide with me  In France there is undoubtedly a more general diffusion of knowledge than in any part of the European world and I attribute it in a great measure to the social intercourse which has long subsisted between the sexes It is true I utter my sentiments with freedom that in France the very essence of sensuality has been extracted to regale the voluptuary and a kind of sentimental lust has prevailed which together  with the system of duplicity that the whole tenour of their political and civil government taught have given a sinister sort of sagacity to the French character properly termed finesse and a polish of manners that injures the substance by hunting sincerity out of societyAnd modesty the fairest garb of virtue has been more grossly insulted in France than even in England till their women have treated as  prudish  that attention to decency which brutes instinctively observe  Manners and morals are so nearly allied that they have often been confounded but though the former should only be the natural reflection of the latter yet when various causes have produced factitious and corrupt manners which are very early caught morality becomes an empty name The personal reserve and sacred respect for cleanliness and delicacy in domestic life which French women almost despise are the graceful  pillars of modesty but far from despising them if the pure flame of patriotism have reached their bosoms they should labour to improve the morals of their fellowcitizens by teaching men not only to respect modesty in women but to acquire it themselves as the only way to merit their esteem  Contending for the rights of woman my main argument is built on this simple principle that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man she will stop the progress of knowledge for truth must be common to all or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice And how can woman be expected to cooperate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty and see in what manner it is connected with her real good If children are to be educated to understand the true principle  of patriotism their mother must be a patriot and the love of mankind from which an orderly train of virtues spring can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind but the education and situation of woman at present shuts her out from such investigations  In this work I have produced many arguments which to me were conclusive to prove that the prevailing notion respecting a sexual character was subversive of morality and I have contended that to render the human body and mind more perfect chastity must more universally prevail and that chastity will never be respected in the male world till the person of a woman is not as it were idolized when little virtue or sense embellish it with the grand traces of mental beauty or the interesting simplicity of affection  Consider Sir dispassionately these observationsfor a glimpse of this truth seemed to  open before you when you observed  that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government was a political phaenomenon that according to abstract principles it was impossible to explain  If so on what does your constitution rest If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation those of woman by a parity of reasoning will not shrink from the same test though a different opinion prevails in this country built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of womanprescription  Consider I address you as a legislator whether when men contend for their freedom and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their own happiness it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness Who made man the  exclusive judge if woman partake with him the gift of reason  In this style argue tyrants of every denomination from the weak king to the weak father of a family they are all eager to crush reason yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be useful Do you not act a similar part when you  force  all women by denying them civil and political rights to remain immured in their families groping in the dark for surely Sir you will not assert that a duty can be binding which is not founded on reason If indeed this be their destination arguments may be drawn from reason and thus augustly supported the more understanding women acquire the more they will be attached to their dutycomprehending itfor unless they comprehend it unless their morals be fixed on the same immutable principle as those of man no authority can make them discharge it in a virtuous manner They may be convenient slaves but slavery will have its  constant effect degrading the master and the abject dependent  But if women are to be excluded without having a voice from a participation of the natural rights of mankind prove first to ward off the charge of injustice and inconsistency that they want reasonelse this flaw in your NEW CONSTITUTION the first constitution founded on reason will ever shew that man must in some shape act like a tyrant and tyranny in whatever part of society it rears its brazen front will ever undermine morality  I have repeatedly asserted and produced what appeared to me irrefragable arguments drawn from matters of fact to prove my assertion that women cannot by force be confined to domestic concerns for they will however ignorant intermeddle with more weighty affairs neglecting private duties only to disturb by cunning tricks the orderly plans of reason which rise above their comprehension  Besides whilst they are only made to acquire personal accomplishments men will seek for pleasure in variety and faithless husbands will make faithless wives such ignorant beings indeed will be very excusable when not taught to respect public good nor allowed any civil rights they attempt to do themselves justice by retaliation  The box of mischief thus opened in society what is to preserve private virtue the only security of public freedom and universal happiness  Let there be then no coercion  established  in society and the common law of gravity prevailing the sexes will fall into their proper places And now that more equitable laws are forming your citizens marriage may become more sacred your young men may choose wives from motives of affection and your maidens allow love to root out vanity  The father of a family will not then weaken his constitution and debase his sentiments by visiting the harlot nor forget in obeying the call of appetite the purpose for which it was implanted And the mother will not neglect her children to practise the arts of coquetry when sense and modesty secure her the friendship of her husband  But till men become attentive to the duty of a father it is vain to expect women to spend that time in their nursery which they 'wise in their generation' choose to spend at their glass for this exertion of cunning is only an instinct of nature to enable them to obtain indirectly a little of that power of which they are unjustly denied a share for if women are not permitted to enjoy legitimate rights they will render both men and themselves vicious to obtain illicit privileges  I wish Sir to set some investigations of this kind afloat in France and should they  lead to a confirmation of my principles when your constitution is revised the Rights of Woman may be respected if it be fully proved that reason calls for this respect and loudly demands JUSTICE for one half of the human race  I am SIR  Your's respectfully M W  ADVERTISEMENT  WHEN I began to write this work I divided it into three parts supposing that one volume would contain a full discussion of the arguments which seemed to me to rise naturally from a few simple principles but fresh illustrations occurring as I advanced I now present only the first

the living world with anxious solicitude the most melancholy emotions of sorrowful indignation have depressed my spirits and I have sighed when obliged to confess that either nature has made a great difference between man and man or that the civilization which has hitherto taken place in the world has been very partial I have turned over various books written on the subject of education and patiently observed the conduct of parents and the management of schools but what has been the resulta profound conviction that the neglected education of my fellowcreatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore and that women in particular are rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes originating from one hasty conclusion The conduct and manners of women in fact evidently prove  that their minds are not in a healthy state for like the flowers which are planted in too rich a soil strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty and the flaunting leaves after having pleased a fastidious eye fade disregarded on the stalk long before the season when they ought to have arrived at maturityOne cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false system of education gathered from the books written on this subject by men who considering females rather as women than human creatures have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than rational wives and the understanding of the sex has been so bubbled by this specious homage that the civilized women of the present century with a few exceptions are only anxious to inspire love when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition and by their abilities and virtues exact respect  In a treatise therefore on female rights and manners the works which have been particularly written for their improvement must not be overlooked especially when it is asserted in direct terms that the minds of women are enfeebled by false refinement  that the books of instruction written by men of genius have had the same tendency as more frivolous productions and that in the true style of Mahometanism they are only considered as females and not as a part of the human species when improvable reason is allowed to be the dignified distinction which raises men above the brute creation and puts a natural sceptre in a feeble hand  Yet because I am a woman I would not lead my readers to suppose that I mean violently to agitate the contested question respecting the equality or inferiority of the sex but as the subject lies in my way and I cannot pass it over without subjecting the main tendency of my reasoning to misconstruction I shall stop a moment to deliver in a few words my opinionIn the government of the physical world it is observable that the female in general is inferior to the male The male pursues the female yields this is the law of nature and it does not appear to be suspended or abrogated in favour of woman This physical superiority cannot be deniedand it is a noble prerogative But not content with this natural preemiminence  men endeavour to sink us still lower merely to render us alluring objects for a moment and women intoxicated by the adoration which men under the influence of their senses pay them do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts or to become the friends of the fellow creatures who find amusement in their society  I am aware of an obvious inferencefrom every quarter have I heard exclamations against masculine women but where are they to be found If by this appellation men mean to inveigh against their ardour in hunting shooting and gaming I shall most cordially join in the cry but if it be against the imitation of manly virtues or more properly speaking the attainment of those talents and virtues the exercise of which ennobles the human character and which raise females in the scale of animal being when they are comprehensively termed mankindall those who view them with a philosophical eye must I should think wish with me that they may every day grow more and more masculine  This discussion naturally divides the subject I shall first consider women in the  grand light of human creatures who in common with men are placed on this earth to unfold their faculties and afterwards I shall more particularly point out their peculiar designation  I wish also to steer clear of an error which many respectable writers have fallen into for the instruction which has hither been addressed to women has rather been applicable to  ladies  if the little indirect advice that is scattered through Sandford and Merton be excepted but addressing my sex in a firmer tone I pay particular attention to those in the middle class because they appear to be in the most natural state Perhaps the seeds of falserefinement immorality and vanity have ever been shed by the great Weak artificial beings raised above the common wants and affections of their race in a premature unnatural manner undermine the very foundation of virtue and spread corruption through the whole mass of society As a class of mankind they have the strongest claim to pity the education of the rich tends to render them vain and helpless and the unfolding mind is not strengthened by the  practice of those duties which dignify the human characterThey only live to amuse themselves and by the same law which in nature invariably produces certain effects they soon only afford barren amusement  But as I purpose taking a separate view of the different ranks of society and of the moral character of women in each this hint is for the present sufficient and I have only alluded to the subject because it appears to me to be the very essence of an introduction to give a cursory account of the contents of the work it introduces  My own sex I hope will excuse me if I treat them like rational creatures instead of flattering their  fascinating  graces and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood unable to stand alone I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consistsI wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength both of mind and body and to convince them that the soft phrases susceptibility of heart delicacy of sentiment and refinement of taste are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love which  has been termed its sister will soon become objects of contempt  Dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases which the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence and despising that weak elegancy of mind exquisite sensibility and sweet docility of manners supposed to be the sexual characteristics of the weaker vessel I wish to shew that elegance is inferior to virtue that the first object of laudable ambition is to obtain a character as a human being regardless of the distinction of sex and that secondary views should be brought to this simple touchstone  This is a rough sketch of my plan and should I express my conviction with the energetic emotions that I feel whenever I think of the subject the dictates of experience and reflection will be felt by some of my readers Animated by this important object I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style I aim at being useful and sincerity will render me unaffected for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle by the elegance of my language I shall not waste my time in rounding periods nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial  feelings which coming from the head never reach the heartI shall be employed about things not wordsand anxious to render my sex more respectable members of society I shall try to avoid that flowery diction which has slided from essays into novels and from novels into familiar letters and conversation  These pretty nothingsthese caricatures of the real beauty of sensibility dropping glibly from the tongue vitiate the taste and create a kind of sickly delicacy that turns away from simple unadorned truth and a deluge of false sentiments and overstretched feelings stifling the natural emotions of the heart render the domestic pleasures insipid that ought to sweeten the exercise of those severe duties which educate a rational and immortal being for a nobler field of action  The education of women has of late been more attended to than formerly yet they are still reckoned a frivolous sex and ridiculed or pitied by the writers who endeavour by satire or instruction to improve them It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering  of accomplishments meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty to the desire of establishing themselvesthe only way women can rise in the worldby marriage And this desire making mere animals of them when they marry they act as such children may be expected to actthey dress they paint and nickname God's creaturesSurely these weak beings are only fit for a seraglio Can they govern a family or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world  If then it can be fairly deduced from the present conduct of the sex from the prevalent fondness for pleasure which takes place of ambition and those nobler passions that open and enlarge the soul that the instruction which women have received has only tended with the constitution of civil society to render them insignificant objects of desiremere propagators of foolsif it can be proved that in aiming to accomplish them without cultivating their understandings they are taken out of their sphere of duties and made ridiculous and useless when the shortlived bloom  of beauty is over  A lively writer I cannot recollect his name asks what business women turned of forty have to do in the world  I presume that  rational  men will excuse me for endeavouring to persuade them to become more masculine and respectable  Indeed the word masculine is only a bugbear there is little reason to fear that women will acquire too much courage or fortitude for their apparent inferiority with respect to bodily strength must render them in some degree dependent on men in the various relations of life but why should it be increased by prejudices that give a sex to virtue and confound simple truths with sensual reveries  Women are in fact so much degraded by mistaken notions of female excellence that I do not mean to add a paradox when I assert that this artificial weakness produces a propensity to tyrannize and gives birth to cunning the natural opponent of strength which leads them to play off those contemptible infantine airs that undermine esteem even whilst they excite desire Do not foster these prejudices  and they will naturally fall into their subordinate yet respectable station in life  It seems scarcely necessary to say that I now speak of the sex in general Many individuals have more sense than their male relatives and as nothing preponderates where there is a constant struggle for an equilibrium without it has naturally more gravity some women govern their husbands without degrading themselves because intellect will always govern  VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN PART I  CHAP I THE RIGHTS AND INVOLVED DUTIES OF MANKIND CONSIDERED  IN the present state of society it appears necessary to go back to first principles in search of the most simple truths and to dispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground To clear my way I must be allowed to ask some plain questions and the answers will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on which reasoning is built though when entangled with various motives of action they are formally contradicted either by the words or conduct of men  In what does man's preeminence over the brute creation consist The answer is as clear as that a half is less than the whole in Reason  What acquirement exalts one being above another Virtue we spontaneously reply  For what purpose were the passions implanted That man by struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to the brutes whispers Experience  Consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of happiness must be estimated by the degree of reason virtue and knowledge that distinguish the individual and direct the laws which bind society and that from the exercise of reason knowledge and virtue naturally flow is equally undeniable if mankind be viewed collectively  The rights and duties of man thus simplified it seems almost impertinent to attempt to illustrate truths that appear so incontrovertible yet such deeply rooted prejudices have clouded reason and such spurious qualities have assumed the name of virtues that it is necessary to pursue the course of reason as it has been perplexed and involved in error by various adventitious circumstances comparing the simple axiom with casual deviations  Men in general seem to employ their reason to justify prejudices which they have imbibed they cannot trace how rather than to  root them out The mind must be strong that resolutely forms its own principles for a kind of intellectual cowardice prevails which makes many men shrink from the task or only do it by halves Yet the imperfect conclusions thus drawn are frequently very plausible because they are built on partial experience on just though narrow views  Going back to first principles vice skulks with all its native deformity from close investigation but a set of shallow reasoners are always exclaiming that these arguments prove too much and that a measure rotten at the core may be expedient Thus expediency is continually contrasted with simple principles till truth is lost in a mist of words virtue in forms and knowledge rendered a sounding nothing by the specious prejudices that assume its name  That the society is formed in the wisest manner whose constitution is founded on the nature of man strikes in the abstract every thinking being so forcibly that it looks like presumption to endeavour to bring forward proofs though proof must be brought or the strong hold of prescription will never be forced by reason yet to urge prescription as  an argument to justify the depriving men or women of their natural rights is one of the absurd sophisms which daily insult common sense  The civilization of the bulk of the people of Europe is very partial nay it may be made a question whether they have acquired any virtues in exchange for innocence equivalent to the misery produced by the vices that have been plastered over unsightly ignorance and the freedom which has been bartered for splendid slavery The desire of dazzling by riches the most certain preeminence that man can obtain the pleasure of commanding flattering sycophants and many other complicated low calculations of doting selflove have all contributed to overwhelm the mass of mankind and make liberty a convenient handle for mock patriotism For whilst rank and titles are held of the utmost importance before which Genius "must hide its diminished head" it is with a few exceptions very unfortunate for a nation when a man of abilities without rank or property pushes himself forward to notice Alas what unheard of misery have thousands suffered to purchase a cardinal's hat for  an intriguing obscure adventurer who longed to be ranked with princes or lord it over them by seizing the triple crown  Such indeed has been the wretchedness that has flowed from hereditary honours riches and monarchy that men of lively sensibility have almost uttered blasphemy in order to justify the dispensations of providence Man has been held out as independent of his power who made him or as a lawless planet darting from its orbit to steal the celestial fire of reason and the vengeance of heaven lurking in the subtile flame sufficiently punished his temerity by introducing evil into the world  Impressed by this view of the misery and disorder which pervaded society and fatigued with jostling against artificial fools Rousseau became enamoured of solitude and being at the same time an optimist he labours with uncommon eloquence to prove that man was naturally a solitary animal Misled by his respect for the goodness of God who certainlyfor what man of sense and feeling can doubt itgave life only to communicate happiness he considers evil as positive and the work of man not aware that he was  exalting one attribute at the expence of another equally necessary to divine perfection  Reared on a false hypothesis his arguments in favour of a state of nature are plausible but unsound I say unsound for to assert that a state of nature is preferable to civilization in all its possible perfection is it other words to arraign supreme wisdom and the paradoxical exclamation that God has made all things right and that evil has been introduced by the creature whom he formed knowing what he formed is as unphilosophical as impious  When that wise Being who created us and placed us here saw the fair idea he willed by allowing it to be so that the passions should unfold our reason because he could see that present evil would produce future good Could the helpless creature whom he called from nothing break loose from his providence and boldly learn to know good by practising evil without his permission No How could that energetic advocate for immortality argue so inconsistently Had mankind remained for ever in the brutal state of nature which even his magic pen cannot paint as a state in which a single virtue took root it would have been clear though not to the  sensitive unreflecting wanderer that man was born to run the circle of life and death and adorn God's garden for some purpose which could not easily be reconciled with his attributes  But if to crown the whole there were to be rational creatures produced allowed to rise in excellence by the exercise of powers implanted for that purpose if benignity itself thought fit to call into existence a creature above the brutes  Contrary to the opinion of anatomists who argue by analogy from the formation of the teeth stomach and intestines Rousseau will not allow a man to be a carnivorous animal And carried away from nature by a love of system he disputes whether man be a gregarious animal though the long and helpless state of infancy seems to point him out as particularly impelled to pair  who could think and improve himself why should that inestimable gift for a gift it was if man was so created as to have a capacity to rise above the state in which sensation produced brutal ease be called in direct terms a curse A curse it might be reckoned if all our existence was bounded by our continuance in this world for why should the gracious fountain of life give us passions and the power of reflecting only to imbitter our days and inspire us with  mistaken notions of dignity Why should he lead us from love of ourselves to the sublime emotions which the discovery of his wisdom and goodness excites if these feelings were not set in motion to improve our nature of which they make a part  What would you say to a mechanic whom you had desired to make a watch to point out the hour of the day if to shew his ingenuity he added wheels to make it a repeater c that perplexed the simple mechanism should he urge to excuse himselfhad you not touched a certain spring you would have known nothing of the matter and that he should have amused himself by making  an experiment  without doing you any harm would you not retort fairly upon him by insisting that if he had not added those needless wheels and springs the accident could not have happened  and render us capable of enjoying a more godlike portion of happiness Firmly persuaded that no evil exists in the world that God did not design to take place I build my belief on the perfection of God  Rousseau exerts himself to prove that all  was  right originally a crowd of authors that all  is  now right and I that all will  be  right  But true to his first position next to a state of nature Rousseau celebrates barbarism and apostrophizing the shade of Fabricius he forgets  that in conquering the world the Romans never dreamed of establishing their own liberty on a firm basis or of extending the reign of virtue Eager to support his system he stigmatizes as vicious every effort of genius and uttering the apotheosis of savage virtues he exalts those to demigods who were scarcely humanthe brutal Spartans who in defiance of justice and gratitude sacrificed in cold blood the slaves who had shewn themselves men to rescue their oppressors  Disgusted with artificial manners and virtues the citizen of Geneva instead of properly sifting the subject threw away the wheat with the chaff without waiting to inquire whether the evils which his ardent soul turned from indignantly were the consequence of civilization or the vestiges of barbarism He saw vice trampling on virtue and the semblance of goodness taking place of the reality he saw talents bent by power to sinister purposes and never thought of tracing the gigantic mischief up to arbitrary power up to the hereditary distinctions that clash with the mental superiority that naturally raises a man above his fellows He did  not perceive that regal power in a few generations introduces idiotism into the noble stem and holds out baits to render thousands idle and vicious  Nothing can set the regal character in a more contemptible point of view than the various crimes that have elevated men to the supreme dignityVile intrigues unnatural crimes and every vice that degrades our nature have been the steps to this distinguished eminence yet millions of men have supinely allowed the nerveless limbs of the posterity of such rapacious prowlers to rest quietly on their ensanguined thrones  Could there be a greater insult offered to the rights of man than the beds of justice in France when an infant was made the organ of the detestable Dubois    What but a pestilential vapour can hover over society when its chief director is only instructed in the invention of crimes or the stupid rotine of childish ceremonies Will men never be wisewill they never cease to expect corn from tares and figs from thistles  It is impossible for any man when the most favourable circumstances concur to acquire sufficient knowledge and strength of mind to discharge the duties of a king entrusted with uncontrouled power how then must  they be violated when his very elevation is an insuperable bar to the attainment of either wisdom or virtue when all the feelings of a man are stifled by flattery and reflection shut out by pleasure Surely it is madness to make the fate of thousands depend on the caprice of a weak fellow creature whose very station sinks him  necessarily  below the meanest of his subjects But one power should not be thrown down to exalt anotherfor all power intoxicates weak man and its abuse proves that the more equality there is established among men the more virtue and happiness will reign in society But this and any similar maxim deduced from simple reason raises an outcrythe church or the state is in danger if faith in the wisdom of antiquity is not implicit and they who roused by the sight of human calamity dare to attack human authority are reviled as despisers of God and enemies of man These are bitter calumnies yet they reached one of the best of men  Dr Price  whose ashes still preach peace and whose memory demands a respectful pause when subjects are discussed that lay so near his heart  After attacking the sacred majesty of Kings I shall scarcely excite surprise by adding my firm persuasion that every profession in which great subordination of rank constitutes its power is highly injurious to morality  A standing army for instance is incompatible with freedom because subordination and rigour are the very sinews of military discipline and despotism is necessary to give vigour to enterprizes that one will directs A spirit inspired by romantic notions of honour a kind of morality founded on the fashion of the age can only be felt by a few officers whilst the main body must be moved by command like the waves of the sea for the strong wind of authority pushes the crowd of subalterns forward they scarcely know or care why with headlong fury  Besides nothing can be so prejudicial to the morals of the inhabitants of country towns as the occasional residence of a set of idle superficial young men whose only occupation is gallantry and whose polished manners render vice more dangerous by concealing its deformity under gay ornamental  drapery An air of fashion which is but a badge of slavery and proves that the soul has not a strong individual character awes simple country people into an imitation of the vices when they cannot catch the slippery graces of politeness Every corps is a chain of despots who submitting and tyrannizing without exercising their reason become dead weights of vice and folly on the community A man of rank or fortune sure of rising by interest has nothing to do but to pursue some extravagant freak whilst the needy  gentleman  who is to rise as the phrase turns by his merit becomes a servile parasite or vile pander  Sailors the naval gentlemen come under the same description only their vices assume a different and a grosser cast They are more positively indolent when not discharging the ceremonials of their station whilst the insignificant fluttering of soldiers may be termed active idleness More confined to the society of men the former acquire a fondness for humour and mischievous tricks whilst the latter mixing frequently with wellbred women catch a sentimental cant But mind is equally out of the question  whether they indulge the horselaugh or polite simper  May I be allowed to extend the comparison to a profession where more mind is certainly to be found for the clergy have superior opportunities of improvement though subordination almost equally cramps their faculties The blind submission imposed at college to forms of belief serves as a novitiate to the curate who must obsequiously respect the opinion of his rector or patron if he means to rise in his profession Perhaps there cannot be a more forcible contrast than between the servile dependent gait of a poor curate and the courtly mien of a bishop And the respect and contempt they inspire render the discharge of their separate functions equally useless  It is of great importance to observe that the character of every man is in some degree formed by his profession A man of sense may only have a cast of countenance that wears off as you trace his individuality whilst the weak common man has scarcely ever any character but what belongs to the body at least all his opinions have been so steeped in the vat consecrated by authority  that the faint spirit which the grape of his own vine yields cannot be distinguished  Society therefore as it becomes more enlightened should be very careful not to establish bodies of men who must necessarily be made foolish or vicious by the very constitution of their profession  In the infancy of society when men were just emerging out of barbarism chiefs and priests touching the most powerful springs of savage conduct hope and fear must have had unbounded sway An aristocracy of course is naturally the first form of government But clashing interests soon losing their equipoise a monarchy and hierarchy break out of the confusion of ambitious struggles and the foundation of both is secured by feudal tenures This appears to be the origin of monarchical and priestly power and the dawn of civilization But such combustible materials cannot long be pent up and getting vent in foreign wars and intestine insurrections the people acquire some power in the tumult which obliges their rulers to gloss over their oppression with a shew of right Thus as wars agriculture commerce  and literature expand the mind despots are compelled to make covert corruption hold fast the power which was formerly snatched by open force  Men of abilities scatter seeds that grow up and have a great influence on the forming opinion and when once the public opinion preponderates through the exertion of reason the overthrow of arbitrary power is not very distant  And this baneful lurking gangrene is most quickly spread by luxury and superstition the sure dregs of ambition The indolent puppet of a court first becomes a luxurious monster or fastidious sensualist and then makes the contagion which his unnatural state spread the instrument of tyranny  It is the pestiferous purple which renders the progress of civilization a curse and warps the understanding till men of sensibility doubt whether the expansion of intellect produces a greater portion of happiness or misery But the nature of the poison points out the antidote and had Rousseau mounted one step higher in his investigation or could his eye have pierced through the foggy atmosphere which he almost disdained to  breathe his active mind would have darted forward to contemplate the perfection of man in the establishment of true civilization instead of taking his ferocious flight back to the night of sensual ignorance  CHAP II THE PREVAILING OPINION OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER DISCUSSED  TO account for and excuse the tyranny of man many ingenious arguments have been brought forward to prove that the two sexes in the acquirement of virtue ought to aim at attaining a very different character or to speak explicitly women are not allowed to have sufficient strength of mind to acquire what really deserves the name of virtue Yet it should seem allowing them to have souls that there is but one way appointed by Providence to lead  mankind  to either virtue or happiness  If then women are not a swarm of ephemeron triflers why should they be kept in ignorance under the specious name of innocence Men complain and with reason of the follies and caprices of our sex when they do not keenly satirize our headstrong passions and groveling vices  Behold I should answer the natural effect of ignorance The mind will ever be unstable that has only prejudices to rest on and the current will run with destructive fury when there are no barriers to break its force Women are told from their infancy and taught by the example of their mothers that a little knowledge of human weakness justly termed cunning softness of temper  outward  obedience and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety will obtain for them the protection of man and should they be beautiful every thing else is needless for at least twenty years of their lives  Thus Milton describes our first frail mother though when he tells us that women are formed for softness and sweet attractive grace I cannot comprehend his meaning unless in the true Mahometan strain he meant to deprive us of souls and insinuate that we were beings only designed by sweet attractive grace and docile blind obedience to gratify the senses of man when he can no longer soar on the wing of contemplation  How grossly do they insult us who thus advise us only to render ourselves gentle domestic  brutes For instance the winning softness so warmly and frequently recommended that governs by obeying What childish expressions and how insignificant is the beingcan it be an immortal one who will condescend to govern by such sinister methods  Certainly says Lord Bacon man is of kin to the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit he is a base and ignoble creature  Men indeed appear to me to act in a very unphilosophical manner when they try to secure the good conduct of women by attempting to keep them always in a state of childhood Rousseau was more consistent when he wished to stop the progress of reason in both sexes for if men eat of the tree of knowledge women will come in for a taste but from the imperfect cultivation which their understandings now receive they only attain a knowledge of evil  Children I grant should be innocent but when the epithet is applied to men or women it is but a civil term for weakness For if it be allowed that women were destined by Providence to acquire human virtues and by the exercise of their understandings that stability of character which is the firmest  ground to rest our future hopes upon they must be permitted to turn to the fountain of light and not forced to shape their course by the twinkling of a mere satellite Milton I grant was of a very different opinion for he only bends to the indefeasible right of beauty though it would be difficult to render two passages which I now mean to contrast consistent But into similar inconsistencies are great men often led by their senses  'To whom thus Eve with  perfect beauty  adorn'dâ–ª  'My Author and Disposer what thou bidst  '  Unargued  I obey so God ordains  'God is  thy law thou mine  to know no more  'Is Woman's  happiest  knowledge and her  praise  '  These are exactly the arguments that I have used to children but I have added your reason is now gaining strength and till it arrives at some degree of maturity you must look up to me for advicethen you ought to  think  and only rely on God  Yet in the following lines Milton seems to coincide with me when he makes Adam thus expostulate with his Maker  'Hast thou not made me here thy substitute  'And these inferior far beneath me set  'Among  unequals  what society  'Can sort what harmony or true delight  'Which must be mutual in proportion due  'Giv'n and receiv'd but in  disparity  'The one intense the other still remiss  'Cannot well suit with either but soon prove  'Tedious alike of  fellowship  I speak  'Such as I seek fit to participate  'All rational delight  In treating therefore of the manners of women let us disregarding sensual arguments trace what we should endeavour to make them in order to cooperate if the expression be not too bold with the supreme Being  By individual education I mean for the sense of the word is not precisely defined such an attention to a child as will slowly sharpen the senses form the temper regulate the passions as they begin to ferment and set the understanding to work before the body arrives at maturity so that the man may only have to proceed not to begin the important task of learning to think and reason  To prevent any misconstruction I must add that I do not believe that a private education can work the wonders which some sanguine writers have attributed to it Men and women must be educated in a great degree by the opinions and manners of the  society they live in In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it and given a family character as it were to the century It may then fairly be inferred that till society be differently constituted much cannot be expected from education It is however sufficient for my present purpose to assert that whatever effect circumstances have on the abilities every being may become virtuous by the exercise of its own reason for if but one being was created with vicious inclinations that is positively bad what can save us from atheism or if we worship a God is not that God a devil  Consequently the most perfect education in my opinion is such an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart Or in other words to enable the individual to attain such habits of virtue as will render it independent In fact it is a farce to call any being virtuous whose virtues do not result from the exercise of its own reason This was Rousseau's opinion respecting men I extend it to women and confidently assert that they have been drawn out of their sphere by false refinement and not by an endeavour to  acquire masculine qualities Still the regal homage which they receive is so intoxicating that till the manners of the times are changed and formed on more reasonable principles it may be impossible to convince them that the illegitimate power which they obtain by degrading themselves is a curse and that they must return to nature and equality if they wish to secure the placid satisfaction that unsophisticated affections impart But for this epoch we must wait wait perhaps till kings and nobles enlightened by reason and preferring the real dignity of man to childish state throw off their gaudy hereditary trappings and if then women do not resign the arbitrary power of beautythey will prove that they have  less  mind than man  I may be accused of arrogance still I must declare what I firmly believe that all the writers who have written on the subject of female education and manners from Rousseau to Dr Gregory have contributed to render women more artificial weak characters than they would otherwise have been and consequently more useless members of societyâ–ª I might have expressed this conviction in a lower key but I am afraid it would have  been the whine of affectation and not the faithful expression of my feelings of the clear result which experience and reflection have led me to draw When I come to that division of the subject I shall advert to the passages that I more particularly disapprove of in the works of the authors I have just alluded to but it is first necessary to observe that my objection extends to the whole purport of those books which tend in my opinion to degrade one half of the human species and render women pleasing at the expence of every solid virtue  Though to reason on Rousseau's ground if man did attain a degree of perfection of mind when his body arrived at maturity it might be proper in order to make a man and his wife  one  that she should rely entirely on his understanding and the graceful ivy clasping the oak that supported it would form a whole in which strength and beauty would be equally conspicuous But alas husbands as well as their helpmates are often only overgrown children nay thanks to early debauchery scarcely men in their outward formand if the blind lead the blind one need not come from heaven to tell us the consequence  Many are the causes that in the present corrupt state of society contribute to enslave women by cramping their understandings and sharpening their senses One perhaps that silently does more mischief than all the rest is their disregard of order  To do every thing in an orderly manner is a most important precept which women who generally speaking receive only a disorderly kind of education seldom attend to with that degree of exactness that men who from their infancy are broken into method observe This negligent kind of guesswork for what other epithet can be used to point out the random exertions of a sort of instinctive common sense never brought to the test of reason prevents their generalizing matters of factso they do today what they did yesterday merely because they did it yesterday  This contempt of the understanding in early life has more baneful consequences than is commonly supposed for the little knowledge which women of strong minds attain is from various circumstances of a more desultory kind than the knowledge of men and it is acquired more by sheer observations on real  life than from comparing what has been individually observed with the results of experience generalized by speculation Led by their dependent situation and domestic employments more into society what they learn is rather by snatches and as learning is with them in general only a secondary thing they do not pursue any one branch with that persevering ardour necessary to give vigour to the faculties and clearness to the judgment In the present state of society a little learning is required to support the character of a gentleman and boys are obliged to submit to a few years of discipline But in the education of women the cultivation of the understanding is always subordinate to the acquirement of some corporeal accomplishment even while enervated by confinement and false notions of modesty the body is prevented from attaining that grace and beauty which relaxed halfformed limbs never exhibit Besides in youth their faculties are not brought forward by emulation and having no serious scientific study if they have natural sagacity it is turned too soon on life and manners They dwell on effects and modifications without tracing them back to causes and complicated  rules to adjust behaviour are a weak substitute for simple principles  As a proof that education gives this appearance of weakness to females we may instance the example of military men who are like them sent into the world before their minds have been stored with knowledge or fortified by principles The consequences are similar soldiers acquire a little superficial knowledge snatched from the muddy current of conversation and from continually mixing with society they gain what is termed a knowledge of the world and this acquaintance with manners and customs has frequently been confounded with a knowledge of the human heart But can the crude fruit of casual observation never brought to the test of judgment formed by comparing speculation and experience deserve such a distinction Soldiers as well as women practise the minor virtues with punctilious politeness Where is then the sexual difference when the education has been the same All the difference that I can discern arises from the superior advantage of liberty which enables the former to see more of life  It is wandering from my present subject  perhaps to make a political remark but as it was produced naturally by the train of my reflections I shall not pass it silently over  Standing armies can neverâ–ª consist of resolute robust men they may be well disciplined machines but they will seldom contain men under the influence of strong passions or with very vigorous faculties And as for any depth of understanding I will venture to affirm that it is as rarely to be found in the army as amongst women and the cause I maintain is the same It may be further observed that officers are also particularly attentive to their persons fond of dancing crowded rooms adventures and ridicule  Why should women be censured with petulant acrimony because they seem to have a passion for a scarlet coat Has not education placed them more on a level with soldiers than any other class of men  Like the  fair  sex the business of their lives is gallantryThey were taught to please and they only live to please Yet they do not lose their rank in the distinction of sexes for they are still reckoned superior to women though in what their superiority consists beyond what I have just mentioned it is difficult to discover  The great misfortune is this that they  both acquire manners before morals and a knowledge of life before they have from reflection any acquaintance with the grand ideal outline of human nature The consequence is natural satisfied with common nature they become a prey to prejudices and taking all their opinions on credit they blindly submit to authority So that if they have any sense it is a kind of instinctive glance that catches proportions and decides with respect to manners but fails when arguments are to be pursued below the surface or opinions analyzed  May not the same remark be applied to women Nay the argument may be carried still further for they are both thrown out of a useful station by the unnatural distinctions established in civilized life Riches and hereditary honours have made cyphers of women to give consequence to the numerical figure and idleness has produced a mixture of gallantry and despotism into society which leads the very men who are the slaves of their mistresses to tyrannize over their sisters wives and daughters This is only keeping them in rank and file it is true Strengthen the female mind by enlarging it and there will be an end to blind obedience but as blind obedience is ever  sought for by power tyrants and sensualists are in the right when they endeavour to keep women in the dark because the former only want slaves and the latter a plaything The sensualist indeed has been the most dangerous of tyrants and women have been duped by their lovers as princes by their ministers whilst dreaming that they reigned over them  I now principally allude to Rousseau for his character of Sophia is undoubtedly a captivating one though it appears to me grossly unnatural however it is not the superstructure but the foundation of her character the principles on which her education was built that I mean to attack nay warmly as I admire the genius of that able writer whose opinions I shall often have occasion to cite indignation always takes place of admiration and the rigid frown of insulted virtue effaces the smile of complacency which his eloquent periods are wont to raise when I read his voluptuous reveries Is this the man who in his ardour for virtue would banish all the soft arts of peace and almost carry us back to Spartan discipline Is this the man who delights to paint the useful struggles of passion the triumphs  of good dispositions and the heroic flights which carry the glowing soul out of itself How are these mighty sentiments lowered when he describes the pretty foot and enticing airs of his little favourite But for the present I wave the subject and instead of severely reprehending the transient effusions of overweening sensibility I shall only observe that whoever has cast a benevolent eye on society must often have been gratified by the sight of humble mutual love not dignified by sentiment nor strengthened by a union in intellectual pursuits The domestic trifles of the day have afforded matter for cheerful converse and innocent caresses have softened toils which did not require great exercise of mind or stretch of thought yet has not the sight of this moderate felicity excited more tenderness than respect An emotion similar to what we feel when children are playing or animals sporting  Similar feelings has Milton's pleasing picture of paradisaical happiness ever raised in my mind yet instead of envying the lovely pair I have with conscious dignity or Satanic pride turned to hell for sublimer objects In the same style when viewing some noble monument of human art I have traced the emanation of the Deity in the order I admired till descending from that giddy height I have caught myself contemplating the grandest of all human sightsfor fancy quickly placed in some solitary recess an outcast of fortune rising superior to passion and discontent  whilst the contemplation  of the noble struggles of suffering merit has raised admiration and carried our thoughts to that world where sensation will give place to reason  Women are therefore to be considered either as moral beings or so weak that they must be entirely subjected to the superior faculties of men  Let us examine this question Rousseau declares that a woman should never for a moment feel herself independent that she should be governed by fear to exercise her  natural  cunning and made a coquetish slave in order to render her a more alluring object of desire a  sweeter  companion to man whenever he chooses to relax himself He carries the arguments which he pretends to draw from the indications of nature still further and insinuates that truth and fortitude the corner stones of all human virtue should be cultivated with certain restrictions because with respect to the female character obedience is the grand lesson which ought to be impressed with unrelenting rigour  What nonsense when will a great man arise with sufficient strength of mind to puff  away the fumes which pride and sensuality have thus spread over the subject If women are by nature inferior to men their virtues must be the same in quality if not in degree or virtue is a relative idea consequently their conduct should be founded on the same principles and have the same aim  Connected with man as daughters wives and mothers their moral character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling those simple duties but the end the grand end of their exertions should be to unfold their own faculties and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue They may try to render their road pleasant but ought never to forget in common with man that life yields not the felicity which can satisfy an immortal soul I do not mean to insinuate that either sex should be so lost in abstract reflections or distant views as to forget the affections and duties that lie before them and are in truth the means appointed to produce the fruit of life on the contrary I would warmly recommend them even while I assert that they afford most satisfaction when they are considered in their true subordinate light  Probably the prevailing opinion that woman was created for man may have taken  its rise from Moses's poetical story yet as very few it is presumed who have bestowed any serious thought on the subject ever supposed that Eve was literally speaking one of Adam's ribs the deduction must be allowed to fall to the ground or only be so far admitted as it proves that man from the remotest antiquity found it convenient to exert his strength to subjugate his companion and his invention to shew that she ought to have her neck bent under the yoke because she as well as the brute creation was created to do his pleasure  Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things I have already granted that from the constitution of their bodies men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue I speak collectively of the whole sex but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature In fact how can they if virtue has only one eternal standard I must therefore if I reason consequentially as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction as that there is a God  It follows then that cunning should not be opposed to wisdom little cares to great exertions nor insipid softness varnished over with the name of gentleness to that fortitude which grand views alone can inspire  I shall be told that woman would then lose many of her peculiar graces and the opinion of a well known poet might be quoted to refute my unqualified assertion For Pope has said in the name of the whole male sex  'Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create  'As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate'  In what light this sally places men and women I shall leave to the judicious to determine meanwhile I shall content myself with observing that I cannot discover why unless they are mortal females should always be degraded by being made subservient to love or lust  To speak disrespectfully of love is I know high treason against sentiment and fine feelings but I wish to speak the simple language of truth and rather to address the head than the heart To endeavour to reason love out of the world would be to out Quixote Cervantes  and equally offend against common sense but an endeavour to restrain this tumultuous passion and to prove that it should not be allowed to dethrone superior powers or to usurp the sceptre which the understanding should ever coolly wield appears less wild  Youth is the season for love in both sexes but in those days of thoughtless enjoyment provision should be made for the more important years of life when reflection takes place of sensation But Rousseau and most of the male writers who have followed his steps have warmly inculcated that the whole tendency of female education ought to be directed to one pointto render them pleasing  Let me reason with the supporters of this opinion who have any knowledge of human nature do they imagine that marriage can eradicate the habitude of life The woman who has only been taught to please will soon find that her charms are oblique sunbeams and that they cannot have much effect on her husband's heart when they are seen every day when the summer is passed and gone Will she then have sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort and cultivate  her dormant faculties or is it not more rational to expect that she will try to please other men and in the emotions raised by the expectation of new conquests endeavour to forget the mortification her love or pride has received When the husband ceases to be a loverand the time will inevitably come her desire of pleasing will then grow languid or become a spring of bitterness and love perhaps the most evanescent of all passions gives place to jealousy or vanity  I now speak of women who are restrained by principle or prejudice such women though they would shrink from an intrigue with real abhorrence yet nevertheless wish to be convinced by the homage of gallantry that they are cruelly neglected by their husbands or days and weeks are spent in dreaming of the happiness enjoyed by congenial souls till the health is undermined and the spirits broken by discontent How then can the great art of pleasing be such a necessary study it is only useful to a mistress the chaste wife and serious mother should only consider her power to please as the polish of her virtues and the affection of her husband as one of the comforts that render her task less difficult and  her life happierBut whether she be loved or neglected her first wish should be to make herself respectable and not to rely for all her happiness on a being subject to like infirmities with herself  The amiable Dr Gregory fell into a similar error I respect his heart but entirely disapprove of his celebrated Legacy to his Daughters  He advises them to cultivate a fondness for dress because a fondness for dress he asserts is natural to them I am unable to comprehend what either he or Rousseau mean when they frequently use this indefinite term If they told us that in a preexistent state the soul was fond of dress and brought this inclination with it into a new body I should listen to them with a half smile as I often do when I hear a rant about innate elegance But if he only meant to say that the exercise of the faculties will produce this fondness I deny itIt is not natural but arises like false ambition in men from a love of power  Dr Gregory goes much further he actually recommends dissimulation and advises an innocent girl to give the lie to her feelings and not dance with spirit when gaiety of  heart would make her feet eloquent without making her gestures immodest In the name of truth and common sense why should not one woman acknowledge that she can take more exercise than another or in other words that she has a sound constitution and why to damp innocent vivacity is she darkly to be told that men will draw conclusions which she little thinks ofLet the libertine draw what inference he pleases but I hope that no sensible mother will restrain the natural frankness of youth by instilling such indecent cautions Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and a wiser than Solomon hath said that the heart should be made clean and not trivial ceremonies observed which it is not very difficult to fulfil with scrupulous exactness when vice reigns in the heart  Women ought to endeavour to purify their heart but can they do so when their uncultivated understandings make them entirely dependent on their senses for employment and amusement when no noble pursuit sets them above the little vanities of the day or enables them to curb the wild emotions that agitate a reed over which every passing breeze has  power To gain the affections of a virtuous man is affectation necessary Nature has given woman a weaker frame than man but to ensure her husband's affections must a wife who by the exercise of her mind and body whilst she was discharging the duties of a daughter wife and mother has allowed her constitution to retain its natural strength and her nerves a healthy tone is she I say to condescend to use art and feign a sickly delicacy in order to secure her husband's affection Weakness may excite tenderness and gratify the arrogant pride of man but the lordly caresses of a protector will not gratify a noble mind that pants for and deserves to be respected Fondness is a poor substitute for friendship  In a seraglio I grant that all these arts are necessary the epicure must have his palate tickled or he will sink into apathy but have women so little ambition as to be satisfied with such a condition Can they supinely dream life away in the lap of pleasure or the languor of weariness rather than assert their claim to pursue reasonable pleasures and render themselves conspicuous by practising the virtues which dignify mankind Surely she has not an immortal soul who can loiter life away  merely employed to adorn her person that she may amuse the languid hours and soften the cares of a fellowcreature who is willing to be enlivened by her smiles and tricks when the serious business of life is over  Besides the woman who strengthens her body and exercises her mind will by managing her family and practising various virtues become the friend and not the humble dependent of her husband and if she deserves his regard by possessing such substantial qualities she will not find it necessary to conceal her affection nor to pretend to an unnatural coldness of constitution to excite her husband's passions In fact if we revert to history we shall find that the women who have distinguished themselves have neither been the most beautiful nor the most gentle of their sex  Nature or to speak with strict propriety God has made all things right but man has sought him out many inventions to mar the work I now allude to that part of Dr Gregory's treatise where he advises a wife never to let her husband know the extent of her sensibility or affection Voluptuous precaution and as ineffectual as absurdLove from its very nature must be transitory To  seek for a secret that would render it constant would be as wild a search as for the philosopher's stone or the grand panacea and the discovery would be equally useless or rather pernicious to mankind The most holy band of society is friendship It has been well said by a shrewd satirist "that rare as true love is true friendship is still rarer"  This is an obvious truth and the cause not lying deep will not elude a slight glance of inquiry  Love the common passion in which chance and sensation take place of choice and reason is in some degree felt by the mass of mankind for it is not necessary to speak at present of the emotions that rise above or sink below love This passion naturally increased by suspense and difficulties draws the mind out of its accustomed state and exalts the affections but the security of marriage allowing the fever of love to subside a healthy temperature is thought insipid only by those who have not sufficient intellect to substitute the calm tenderness of friendship the confidence of respect instead of blind admiration and the sensual emotions of fondness  This is must be the course of nature friendship or indifference inevitably succeeds loveAnd this constitution seems perfectly to harmonize with the system of government which prevails in the moral world Passions are spurs to action and open the mind but they sink into mere appetites become a personal and momentary gratification when the object is gained and the satisfied mind rests in enjoyment The man who had some virtue whilst he was struggling for a crown often becomes a voluptuous tyrant when it graces his brow and when the lover is not lost in the husband the dotard a prey to childish caprices and fond jealousies neglects the serious duties of life and the caresses which should excite confidence in his children are lavished on the overgrown child his wife  In order to fulfil the duties of life and to be able to pursue with vigour the various employments which form the moral character a master and mistress of a family ought not to continue to love each other with passion I mean to say that they ought not to indulge those emotions which disturb the order of society and engross the thoughts that should  be otherwise employed The mind that has never been engrossed by one object wants vigourif it can long be so it is weak  A mistaken education a narrow uncultivated mind and many sexual prejudices tend to make women more constant than men but for the present I shall not touch on this branch of the subject I will go still further and advance without dreaming of a paradox that an unhappy marriage is often very advantageous to a family and that the neglected wife is in general the best mother And this would almost always be the consequence if the female mind was more enlarged for it seems to be the common dispensation of Providence that what we gain in present enjoyment should be deducted from the treasure of life experience and that when we are gathering the flowers of the day and revelling in pleasure the solid fruit of toil and wisdom should not be caught at the same time The way lies before us we must turn to the right or left and he who will pass life away in bounding from one pleasure to another must not complain if he neither acquires wisdom nor respectability of character  Supposing for a moment that the soul is not immortal and that man was only created for the present sceneI think we should have reason to complain that love infantine fondness ever grew insipid and palled upon the sense Let us eat drink and love for tomorrow we die would be in fact the language of reason the morality of life and who but a fool would part with a reality for a fleeting shadow But if awed by observing the improvable powers of the mind we disdain to confine our wishes or thoughts to such a comparatively mean field of action that only appears grand and important as it is connected with a boundless prospect and sublime hopes what necessity is there for falsehood in conduct and why must the sacred majesty of truth be violated to detain a deceitful good that saps the very foundation of virtue Why must the female mind be tainted by coquetish arts to gratify the sensualist and prevent love from subsiding into friendship or compassionate tenderness when there are not qualities on which friendship can be built Let the honest heart shew itself and  reason  teach passion to submit to necessity or let  the dignified pursuit of virtue and knowledge raise the mind above those emotions which rather imbitter than sweeten the cup of life when they are not restrained within due bounds  I do not mean to allude to the romantic passion which is the concomitant of genius Who can clip its wing But that grand passion not proportioned to the puny enjoyments of life is only true to the sentiment and feeds on itself The passions which have been celebrated for their durability have always been unfortunate They have acquired strength by absence and constitutional melancholyThe fancy has hovered round a form of beauty dimly seenbut familiarity might have turned admiration into disgust or at least into indifference and allowed the imagination leisure to start fresh game With perfect propriety according to this view of things does Rousseau make the mistress of his soul Eloisa love St Preux when life was fading before her but this is no proof of the immortality of the passion  Of the same complexion is Dr Gregory's advice respecting delicacy of sentiment which he advises a woman not to acquire if she has determined to marry This determination  however perfectly consistent with his former advice he calls  indelicate  and earnestly persuades his daughters to conceal it though it may govern their conduct as if it were indelicate to have the common appetites of human nature  Noble morality and consistent with the cautious prudence of a little soul that cannot extend its views beyond the present minute division of existence If all the faculties of woman's mind are only to be cultivated as they respect her dependence on man if when she obtains a husband she has arrived at her goal and meanly proud is satisfied with such a paltry crown let her grovel contentedly scarcely raised by her employments above the animal kingdom but if she is struggling for the prize of her high calling let her cultivate her understanding without stopping to consider what character the husband may have whom she is destined to marry Let her only determine without being too anxious about present happiness to acquire the qualities that ennoble a rational being and a rough inelegant husband may shock her taste without destroying her peace of mind She will not model her soul to suit the frailties of  her companion but to bear with them his character may be a trial but not an impediment to virtue  If Dr Gregory confined his remark to romantic expectations of constant love and congenial feelings he should have recollected that experience will banish what advice can never make us cease to wish for when the imagination is kept alive at the expence of reason  I own it frequently happens that women who have fostered a romantic unnatural delicacy of feeling waste their  For example the herd of novelists  lives in  imagining  how happy they should have been with a husband who could love them with a fervid increasing affection every day and all day But they might as well pine married as single and would not be a jot more unhappy with a bad husband than longing for a good one That a proper education or to speak with more precision a well stored mind would enable a woman to support a single life with dignity I grant but that she should avoid cultivating her taste lest her husband should occasionally shock it is quitting a substance for a shadow To say the truth I do not know of what use is an improved taste if  the individual is not rendered more independent of the casualties of life if new sources of enjoyment only dependent on the solitary operations of the mind are not opened People of taste married or single without distinction will ever be disgusted by various things that touch not less observing minds On this conclusion the argument must not be allowed to hinge but in the whole sum of enjoyment is taste to be denominated a blessing  The question is whether it procures most pain or pleasure The answer will decide the propriety of Dr Gregory's advice and shew how absurd and tyrannic it is thus to lay down a system of slavery or to attempt to educate moral beings by any other rules than those deduced from pure reason which apply to the whole species  Gentleness of manners forbearance and longsuffering are such amiable Godlike qualities that in sublime poetic strains the Deity has been invested with them and perhaps no representation of his goodness so strongly fastens on the human affections as those that represent him abundant in mercy and willing to pardon Gentleness considered  in this point of view bears on its front all the characteristics of grandeur combined with the winning graces of condescension but what a different aspect it assumes when it is the submissive demeanour of dependence the support of weakness that loves because it wants protection and is forbearing because it must silently endure injuries smiling under the lash at which it dare not snarl Abject as this picture appears it is the portrait of an accomplished woman according to the received opinion of female excellence separated by specious reasoners from human excellence Or they  Vide Rousseau and Swedenborg  kindly restore the rib and make one moral being of a man and woman not forgetting to give her all the 'submissive charms'  How women are to exist in that state where there is to be neither marrying nor giving in marriage we are not told For though moralists have agreed that the tenor of life seems to prove that  man  is prepared by various circumstances for a future state they constantly concur in advising  woman  only to provide for the present Gentleness docility and a spaniellike affection are on this ground consistently recommended as the cardinal virtues  of the sex and disregarding the arbitrary economy of nature one writer has declared that it is masculine for a woman to be melancholy She was created to be the toy of man his rattle and it must jingle in his ears whenever dismissing reason he chooses to be amused  To recommend gentleness indeed on a broad basis is strictly philosophical A frail being should labour to be gentle But when forbearance confounds right and wrong it ceases to be a virtue and however convenient it may be found in a companionthat companion will ever be considered as an inferior and only inspire a vapid tenderness which easily degenerates into contempt Still if advice could really make a being gentle whose natural disposition admitted not of such a fine polish something towards the advancement of order would be attained but if as might quickly be demonstrated only affectation be produced by this indiscriminate counsel which throws a stumblingblock in the way of gradual improvement and true melioration of temper the sex is not much benefited by sacrificing solid virtues to the attainment of superficial graces though for a few years  they may procure the individuals regal sway  As a philosopher I read with indignation the plausible epithets which men use to soften their insults and as a moralist I ask what is meant by such heterogeneous associations as fair defects amiable weaknesses c If there is but one criterion of morals but one archetype for man women appear to be suspended by destiny according to the vulgar tale of Mahomet's coffin they have neither the unerring instinct of brutes nor are allowed to fix the eye of reason on a perfect model They were made to be loved and must not aim at respect lest they should be hunted out of society as masculine  But to view the subject in another point of view Do passive indolent women make the best wives Confining our discussion to the present moment of existence let us see how such weak creatures perform their part Do the women who by the attainment of a few superficial accomplishments have strengthened the prevailing prejudice merely contribute to the happiness of their husbands Do they display their charms merely to amuse them And have women who have early imbibed  notions of passive obedience sufficient character to manage a family or educate children So far from it that after surveying the history of woman I cannot help agreeing with the severest satirist considering the sex as the weakest as well as the most oppressed half of the species What does history disclose but marks of inferiority and how few women have emancipated themselves from the galling yoke of sovereign manSo few that the exceptions remind me of an ingenious conjecture respecting Newton that he was probably a being of a superior order accidentally caged in a human body In the same style I have been led to imagine that the few extraordinary women who have rushed in eccentrical directions out of the orbit prescribed to their sex were  male  spirited confined by mistake in a female frame But if it be not philosophical to think of sex when the soul is mentioned the inferiority must depend on the organs or the heavenly fire which is to ferment the clay is not given in equal portions  But avoiding as I have hitherto done any direct comparison of the two sexes collectively or frankly acknowledging the inferiority  of woman according to the present appearance of things I shall only insist that men have increased that inferiority till women are almost sunk below the standard of rational creatures Let their faculties have room to unfold and their virtues to gain strength and then determine where the whole sex must stand in the intellectual scale Yet let it be remembered that for a small number of distinguished women I do not ask a place  It is difficult for us purblind mortals to say to what height human discoveries and improvements may arrive when the gloom of despotism subsides which makes us stumble at every step but when morality shall be settled on a more solid basis then without being gifted with a prophetic spirit I will venture to predict that woman will be either the friend or slave of man We shall not as at present doubt whether she is a moral agent or the link which unites man with brutes But should it then appear that like the brutes they were principally created for the use of man he will let them patiently bite the bridle and not mock them with empty praise or should their rationality be proved  he will not impede their improvement merely to gratify his sensual appetites He will not with all the graces of rhetoric advise them to submit implicitly their understanding to the guidance of man He will not when he treats of the education of women assert that they ought never to have the free use of reason nor would he recommend cunning and dissimulation to beings who are acquiring in like manner as himself the virtues of humanity  Surely there can be but one rule of right if morality has an eternal foundation and whoever sacrifices virtue strictly so called to present convenience or whose  duty  it is to act in such a manner lives only for the passing day and cannot be an accountable creature  The poet then should have dropped his sneer when he says  "If weak women go astray  "The stars are more in fault than they"  For that they are bound by the adamantine chain of destiny is most certain if it be proved that they are never to exercise their own reason never to be independent never to rise  above opinion or to feel the dignity of a rational will that only bows to God and often forgets that the universe contains any being but itself and the model of perfection to which its ardent gaze is turned to adore attributes that softened into virtues may be imitated in kind though the degree overwhelms the enraptured mind  If I say for I would not impress by declamation when Reason offers her sober light if they are really capable of acting like rational creatures let them not be treated like slaves or like the brutes who are dependent on the reason of man when they associate with him but cultivate their minds give them the salutary sublime curb of principle and let them attain conscious dignity by feeling themselves only dependent on God Teach them in common with man to submit to necessity instead of giving to render them more pleasing a sex to morals  Further should experience prove that they cannot attain the same degree of strength of mind perseverance and fortitude let their virtues be the same in kind though they may vainly struggle for the same degree and the superiority of man will be equally clear if not  clearer and truth as it is a simple principle which admits of no modification would be common to both Nay the order of society as it is at present regulated would not be inverted for woman would then only have the rank that reason assigned her and arts could not be practised to bring the balance even much less to turn it  These may be termed Utopian dreams Thanks to that Being who impressed them on my soul and gave me sufficient strength of mind to dare to exert my own reason till becoming dependent only on him for the support of my virtue I view with indignation the mistaken notions that enslave my sex  I love man as my fellow but his scepter real or usurped extends not to me unless the reason of an individual demands my homage and even then the submission is to reason and not to man In fact the conduct of an accountable being must be regulated by the operations of its own reason or on what foundation rests the throne of God  It appears to me necessary to dwell on these obvious truths because females have been insulated as it were and while they have been stripped of the virtues that should clothe  humanity they have been decked with artificial graces that enable them to exercise a shortlived tyranny Love in their bosoms taking place of every nobler passion their sole ambition is to be fair to raise emotion instead of inspiring respect and this ignoble desire like the servility in absolute monarchies destroys all strength of character Liberty is the mother of virtue and if women are by their very constitution slaves and not allowed to breathe the sharp invigorating air of freedom they must ever languish like exotics and be reckoned beautiful flaws in nature let it also be remembered that they are the only flaw  As to the argument respecting the subjection in which the sex has ever been held it retorts on man The many have always been enthralled by the few and monsters who scarcely have shewn any discernment of human excellence have tyrannized over thousands of their fellow creatures Why have men of superiour endowments submitted to such degradation For is it not universally acknowledged that kings viewed collectively have ever been inferior in abilities and virtue to the same number of men taken from the  common mass of mankindyet have they not and are they not still treated with a degree of reverence that is an insult to reason China is not the only country where a living man has been made a God  Men  have submitted to superiour strength to enjoy with impunity the pleasure of the moment  women  have only done the same and therefore till it is proved that the courtier who servilely resigns the birthright of a man is not a moral agent it cannot be demonstrated that woman is essentially inferior to man because she has always been subjugated  Brutal force has hitherto governed the world and that the science of politics is in its infancy is evident from philosophers scrupling to give the knowledge most useful to man that determinate distinction  I shall not pursue this argument any further than to establish an obvious inference that as sound politics diffuse liberty mankind including woman will become more wise and virtuous  CHAP III THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED  BODILY strength from being the distinction of heroes is now sunk into such unmerited contempt that men as well as women seem to think it unnecessary the latter as it takes from their feminine graces and from that lovely weakness the source of their undue power and the former because it appears inimical with the character of a gentleman  That they have both by departing from one extreme run into another may easily be proved but first it may be proper to observe that a vulgar error has obtained a degree of credit which has given force to a false conclusion in which an effect has been mistaken for a cause  People of genius have very frequently impaired their constitutions by study or careless inattention to their health and the violence of their passions bearing a proportion to the vigour of their intellects the sword's destroying  the scabbard has become almost proverbial and superficial observers have inferred from thence that men of genius have commonly weak or to use a more fashionable phrase delicate constitutions Yet the contrary I believe will appear to be the fact for on diligent inquiry I find that strength of mind has in most cases been accompanied by superior strength of bodynatural soundness of constitutionnot that robust tone of nerves and vigour of muscles which arise from bodily labour when the mind is quiescent or only directs the hands  Dr Priestley has remarked in the preface to his biographical chart that the majority of great men have lived beyond fortyfive And considering the thoughtless manner in which they have lavished their strength when investigating a favourite science they have wasted the lamp of life forgetful of the midnight hour or when lost in poetic dreams fancy has peopled the scene and the soul has been disturbed till it shook the constitution by the passions that meditation had raised whose objects the baseless fabric of a vision faded before the exhausted eye they must have had iron frames Shakspeare never  grasped the airy dagger with a nerveless hand nor did Milton tremble when he led Satan far from the confines of his dreary prison These were not the ravings of imbecility the sickly effusions of distempered brains but the exuberance of fancy that 'in a fine phrenzy' wandering was not continually reminded of its material shackles  I am aware that this argument would carry me further than it may be supposed I wish to go but I follow truth and still adhering to my first position I will allow that bodily strength seems to give man a natural superiority over woman and this is the only solid basis on which the superiority of the sex can be built But I still insist that not only the virtue but the  knowledge  of the two sexes should be the same in nature if not in degree and that women considered not only as moral but rational creatures ought to endeavour to acquire human virtues or perfections by the  same  means as men instead of being educated like a fanciful kind of  half  beingone of Rousseau's wild chimeras  Researches into abstract and speculative truths the principles and axioms of sciences in short every thing which tends to generalize our ideas is not the proper province of women their studies should be relative to points of practice it belongs to them to apply those principles which men have discovered and it is their part to make observations which direct men to the establishment of general principles All the ideas of women which have not the immediate tendency to points of duty should be directed to the study of men and to the attainment of those agreeable accomplishments which have taste for their object for as to works of genius they are beyond their capacity neither have they sufficient precision or power of attention to succeed in sciences which require accuracy and as to physical knowledge it belongs to those only who are most active most inquisitive who comprehend the greatest variety of objects in short it belongs to those who have the strongest powers and who exercise them most to judge of the relations between sensible beings and the laws of nature A woman who is naturally weak and does not carry her ideas to any great extent knows how to judge and make a proper estimate of those movements which she sets to work in order to aid her weakness and these movements are the passions of men The mechanism she employs is much more powerful than ours for all her levers move the human heart She must have the skill to incline us to do every thing which her sex will not enable her to do of herself and which is necessary or agreeable to her therefore she ought to study the mind of man thoroughly not the mind of man in general abstracted but the dispositions of those men to whom she is subject either by the laws of her country or by the force of opinion She should learn to penetrate into their real sentiments from their conversation their actions their looks and gestures She should also have the art by her own conversation actions looks and gestures to communicate those sentiments which are agreeable to them without seeming to intend it Men will argue more philosophically about the human heart but women will read the heart of man better than they It belongs to women if I may be allowed the expression to form an experimental morality and to reduce the study of man to a system Women have most wit men have most genius women observe men reason from the concurrence of both we derive the clearest light and the most perfect knowledge which the human mind is of itself capable of attaining In one word from hence we acquire the most intimate acquaintance both with ourselves and others of which our nature is capable and it is thus that art has a constant tendency to perfect those endowments which nature has bestowed The world is the book of women  Rousseau's Emilius  I hope my readers still remember the comparison which I have brought forward between women and officers    But if strength of body be with some shew of reason the boast of men why are women so infatuated as to be proud of a dedefect  Rousseau has furnished them with a plausible excuse which could only have occurred to a man whose imagination had been allowed to run wild and refine on the impressions made by exquisite sensesthat they might forsooth have a pretext for yielding to a natural appetite without violating  a romantic species of modesty which gratifies the pride and libertinism of man  Women deluded by these sentiments sometimes boast of their weakness cunningly obtaining power by playing on the  weakness  of men and they may well glory in their illicit sway for like Turkish bashaws they have more real power than their masters but virtue is sacrificed to temporary gratifications and the respectability of life to the triumph of an hour  Women as well as despots have now perhaps more power than they would have if the world divided and subdivided into kingdoms and families was governed by laws deduced from the exercise of reason but in obtaining it to carry on the comparison their character is degraded and licentiousness spread through the whole aggregate of society The many become pedestal to the few I therefore will venture to assert that till women are more rationally educated the progress of human virtue and improvement in knowledge must receive continual checks And if it be granted that woman was not created merely to gratify the appetite of man nor to be the upper servant who provides his meals and takes care of his  linen it must follow that the first care of those mothers or fathers who really attend to the education of females should be if not to strengthen the body at least not to destroy the constitution by mistaken notions of beauty and female excellence nor should girls ever be allowed to imbibe the pernicious notion that a defect can by any chemical process of reasoning become an excellence In this respect I am happy to find that the author of one of the most instructive books that our country has produced for children coincides with me in opinion I shall quote his pertinent remarks to give the force of his respectable authority to reason  A respectable old man gives the following sensible account of the method he pursued when educating his daughter  I endeavoured to give both to her mind and body a degree of vigour which is seldom found in the female sex As soon as she was sufficiently advanced in strength to be capable of the lighter labours of husbandry and gardening I employed her as my constant companion Selene for that was her name soon acquired a dexterity in all these rustic employments which I considered with equal pleasure and admiration If women are in general feeble both in body and mind it arises less from nature than from education We encourage a vicious indolence and inactivity which we falsely call delicacy instead of hardening their minds by the severer principles of reason and philosophy we breed them to useless arts which terminate in vanity and sensuality In most of the countries which I had visited they are taught nothing of an higher nature than a few modulations of the voice or useless postures of the body their time is consumed in sloth or trifles and trifles become the only pursuits capable of interesting them We seem to forget that it is upon the qualities of the female sex that our own domestic comforts and the education of our children must depend And what are the comforts or the education which a race of beings corrupted from their infancy and unacquainted with all the duties of life are fitted to bestow To touch a musical instrument with useless skill to exhibit their natural or affected graces to the eyes of indolent and debauched young men to dissipate their husband's patrimony in riotous and unnecessary expences these are the only arts cultivated by women in most of the polished nations I had seen And the consequences are uniformly such as may be expected to proceed from such polluted sources private misery and public servitude  But Selene's education was regulated by different views and conducted upon severer principles if that can be called severity which opens the mind to a sense of moral and religious duties and most effectually arms it against the inevitable evils of life  Mr Day's Sandford and Merton  Vol III    But should it be proved that woman is naturally weaker than man from whence does it follow that it is natural for her to labour to become still weaker than nature intended her to be Arguments of this cast are an insult to  common sense and savour of passion The  divine right  of husbands like the divine right of kings may it is to be hoped in this enlightened age be contested without danger and though conviction may not silence many boisterous disputants yet when any prevailing prejudice is attacked the wise will consider and leave the narrowminded to rail with thoughtless vehemence at innovation  The mother who wishes to give true dignity of character to her daughter must regardless of the sneers of ignorance proceed on a plan diametrically opposite to that which Rousseau has recommended with all the deluding charms of eloquence and philosophical sophistry for his eloquence renders absurdities plausible and his dogmatic conclusions puzzle without convincing those who have not ability to refute them  Throughout the whole animal kingdom every young creature requires almost continual exercise and the infancy of children conformable to this intimation should be passed in harmless gambols that exercise the feet and hands without requiring very minute direction from the head or the constant attention of a nurse In fact the care necessary  for selfpreservation is the first natural exercise of the understanding as little inventions to amuse the present moment unfold the imagination But these wife designs of nature are counteracted by mistaken fondness or blind zeal The child is not left a moment to its own direction particularly a girl and thus rendered dependentdependence is called natural  To preserve personal beauty woman's glory the limbs and faculties are cramped with worse than Chinese bands and the sedentary life which they are condemned to live whilst boys frolic in the open air weakens the muscles and relaxes the nerves As for Rousseau's remarks which have since been echoed by several writers that they have naturally that is from their birth independent of education a fondness for dolls dressing and talkingthey are so puerile as not to merit a serious refutation That a girl condemned to sit for hours together listening to the idle chat of weak nurses or to attend at her mother's toilet will endeavour to join the conversation is indeed very natural and that she will imitate her mother or aunts and amuse herself by adorning her lifeless  doll as they do in dressing her poor innocent babe is undoubtedly a most natural consequence For men of the greatest abilities have seldom had sufficient strength to rise above the surrounding atmosphere and if the page of genius has always been blurred by the prejudices of the age some allowance should be made for a sex who like kings always see things through a false medium  In this manner may the fondness for dress conspicuous in women be easily accounted for without supposing it the result of a desire to please the sex on which they are dependent The absurdity in short of supposing that a girl is naturally a coquette and that a desire connected with the impulse of nature to propagate the species should appear even before an improper education has by heating the imagination called it forth prematurely is so unphilosophical that such a sagacious observer as Rousseau would not have adopted it if he had not been accustomed to make reason give way to his desire of singularity and truth to a favourite paradox  Yet thus to give a sex to mind was not very consistent with the principles of a man who argued so warmly and so well for the  immortality of the soulBut what a weak barrier is truth when it stands in the way of an hypothesis Rousseau respectedalmost adored virtueand yet he allowed himself to love with sensual fondness His imagination constantly prepared inflammable fewel for his inflammable senses but in order to reconcile his respect for selfdenial fortitude and those heroic virtues which a mind like his could not coolly admire he labours to invert the law of nature and broaches a doctrine pregnant with mischief and derogatory to the character of supreme wisdom  His ridiculous stories which tend to prove that girls are  naturally  attentive to their persons without laying any stress on daily example are below contemptAnd that a little miss should have such a correct taste as to neglect the pleasing amusement of making O's merely because she perceived that it was an ungraceful attitude should be selected with the anecdotes of the learned pig  I once knew a young person who learned to write before she learned to read and began to write with her needle before she could use a pen At first indeed she took it into her head to make no other letter than the O this letter she was constantly making of all sizes and always the wrong way Unluckily one day as she was intent on this employment she happened to see herself in the lookingglass when taking a dislike to the constrained attitude in which she sat while writing she threw away her pen like another Pallas and determined against making the O any more Her brother was also equally averse to writing it was the confinement however and not the constrained attitude that most disgusted him  Rousseau's Emilius    I have probably had an opportunity of observing more girls in their infancy than J J RousseauI can recollect my own feelings and I have looked steadily around me yet so far from coinciding with him in opinion respecting the first dawn of the female character I will venture to affirm that a girl whose spirits have not been damped by inactivity or innocence tainted by false shame will always be a romp and the dolls will never excite attention unless confinement allows her no alternative Girls and boys in short would play harmlessly together if the distinction of sex was not inculcated long before nature makes any differenceI will go further and affirm as an indisputable fact that most of the women in the circle of my  observation who have acted like rational creatures or shewn any vigour of intellect have accidentally been allowed to run wild as some of the elegant formers of the fair sex would insinuate  The baneful consequences which flow from inattention to health during infancy and youth extend further than is supposed dependence of body naturally produces dependence of mind and how can she be a good wife or mother the greater part of whose time is employed to guard against or endure sickness Nor can it be expected that a woman will resolutely endeavour to strengthen her constitution and abstain from enervating indulgencies if artificial notions of beauty and false descriptions of sensibility have been early entangled with her motives of action Most men are sometimes obliged to bear with bodily inconveniencies and to endure occasionally the inclemency of the elements but genteel women are literally speaking slaves to their bodies and glory in their subjection  I once knew a weak woman of fashion who was more than commonly proud of her delicacy and sensibility She thought a distinguishing  taste and puny appetite the height of all human perfection and acted accordinglyI have seen this weak sophisticated being neglect all the duties of life yet recline with selfcomplacency on a sofa and boast of her want of appetite as a proof of delicacy that extended to or perhaps arose from her exquisite sensibility for it is difficult to render intelligible such ridiculous jargonYet at the moment I have seen her insult a worthy old gentlewoman whom unexpected misfortunes had made dependent on her ostentatious bounty and who in better days had claims on her gratitude Is it possible that a human creature could have become such a weak and depraved being if like the Sybarites dissolved in luxury every thing like virtue had not been worn away or never impressed by precept a poor substitute it is true for cultivation of mind though it serves as a fence against vice  Such a woman is not a more irrational monster than some of the Roman emperors who were depraved by lawless power Yet since kings have been more under the restraint of law and the curb however weak of honour the records of history are not filled with  such unnatural instances of folly and cruelty nor does the despotism that kills virtue and genius in the bud hover over Europe with that destructive blast which desolates Turky and renders the men as well as the soil unfruitful  Women are every where in this deplorable state for in order to preserve their innocence as ignorance is courteously termed truth is hidden from them and they are made to assume an artificial character before their faculties have acquired any strength Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre the mind shapes itself to the body and roaming round its gilt cage only seeks to adorn its prison Men have various employments and pursuits which engage their attention and give a character to the opening mind but women confined to one and having their thoughts constantly directed to the most insignificant part of themselves seldom extend their views beyond the triumph of the hour But was their understanding once emancipated from the slavery to which the pride and sensuality of man and their shortsighted desire like that of dominion in tyrants of present sway has subjected them  we should probably read of their weaknesses with surprise I must be allowed to pursue the argument a little farther  Perhaps if the existence of an evil being was allowed who in the allegorial language of scripture went about seeking whom he should devour he could not more effectually degrade the human character than by giving a man absolute power  This argument branches into various ramificationsBirth riches and every extrinsic advantage that exalt a man above his fellows without any mental exertion sink him in reality below them In proportion to his weakness he is played upon by designing men till the bloated monster has lost all traces of humanity And that tribes of men like flocks of sheep should quietly follow such a leader is a solecism that only a desire of present enjoyment and narrowness of understanding can solve Educated in slavish dependence and enervated by luxury and sloth where shall we find men who will stand forth to assert the rights of manor claim the privilege of moral beings who should have but one road to excellence Slavery to monarchs and ministers  which the world will be long in freeing itself from and whose deadly grasp stops the progress of the human mind is not yet abolished  Let not men then in the pride of power use the same arguments that tyrannic kings and venal ministers have used and fallaciously assert that woman ought to be subjected because she has always been soBut when man governed by reasonable laws enjoys his natural freedom let him despise woman if she do not share it with him and till that glorious period arrives in descanting on the folly of the sex let him not overlook his own  Women it is true obtaining power by unjust means by practising or fostering vice evidently lose the rank which reason would assign them and they become either abject slaves or capricious tyrants They lose all simplicity all dignity of mind in acquiring power and act as men are observed to act when they have been exalted by the same means  It is time to effect a revolution in female mannerstime to restore to them their lost dignityand make them as a part of the  human species labour by reforming themselves to reform the world It is time to separate unchangeable morals from local mannersIf men be demigodswhy let us serve them And if the dignity of the female soul be as disputable as that of animalsif their reason does not afford sufficient light to direct their conduct whilst unerring instinct is deniedthey are surely of all creatures the most miserable and bent beneath the iron hand of destiny must submit to be a  fair defect  in creation But to justify the ways of Providence respecting them by pointing out some irrefragable reason for thus making such a large portion of mankind accountable and not accountable would puzzle the subtilest casuist  The only solid foundation for morality appears to be the character of the supreme Being the harmony of which arises from a balance of attributesand to speak with reverence one attribute seems to imply the  necessity  of another He must be just because he is wise he must be good because he is omnipotent For to exalt one attribute at the expence of another equally noble and necessary bears the stamp of the warped  reason of manthe homage of passion Man accustomed to bow down to power in his savage state can seldom divest himself of this barbarous prejudice even when civilization determines how much superior mental is to bodily strength and his reason is clouded by these crude opinions even when he thinks of the DeityHis omnipotence is made to swallow up or preside over his other attributes and those mortals are supposed to limit his power irreverently who think that it must be regulated by his wisdom  I disclaim that specious humility which after investigating nature stops at the author The High and Lofty One who inhabiteth eternity doubtless possesses many attributes of which we can form no conception but reason tells me that they cannot clash with those I adoreand I am compelled to listen to her voice  It seems natural for man to search for excellence and either to trace it in the object that he worships or blindly to invest it with perfection as a garment But what good effect can the latter mode of worship have on the moral conduct of a rational being He bends to power he adores a dark cloud  which may open a bright prospect to him or burst in angry lawless fury on his devoted headhe knows not why And supposing that the Deity acts from the vague impulse of an undirected will man must also follow his own or act according to rules deduced from principles which he disclaims as irreverent Into this dilemma have both enthusiasts and cooler thinkers fallen when they laboured to free men from the wholesome restraints which a just conception of the character of God imposes  It is not impious thus to scan the attributes of the Almighty in fact who can avoid it that exercises his faculties For to love God as the fountain of wisdom goodness and power appears to be the only worship useful to a being who wishes to acquire either virtue or knowledge A blind unsettled affection may like human passions occupy the mind and warm the heart whilst to do justice love mercy and walk humbly with our God is forgotten I shall pursue this subject still further when I consider religion in a light opposite to that recommended by Dr Gregory who treats it as a matter of sentiment or taste  To return from this apparent digression It were to be wished that women would cherish an affection for their husbands founded on the same principle that devotion ought to rest upon No other firm base is there under heavenfor let them beware of the fallacious light of sentiment too often used as a softer phrase for sensuality It follows then I think that from their infancy women should either be shut up like eastern princes or educated in such a manner as to be able to think and act for themselves  Why do men halt between two opinions and expect impossibilities Why do they expect virtue from a slave from a being whom the constitution of civil society has rendered weak if not vicious  Still I know that it will require a considerable length of time to eradicate the firmly rooted prejudices which sensualists have planted it will also require some time to convince women that they act contrary to their real interest on an enlarged scale when they cherish or affect weakness under the name of delicacy and to convince the world that the poisoned source of female vices and follies if it be necessary in compliance with custom to use synonymous  terms in a lax sense has been the sensual homage paid to beautyto beauty of features for it has been shrewdly observed by a German writer that a pretty woman as an object of desire is generally allowed to be so by men of all descriptions whilst a fine woman who inspires more sublime emotions by displaying intellectual beauty may be overlooked or observed with indifference by those men who find their happiness in the gratification of their appetites I foresee an obvious retortwhilst man remains such an imperfect being as he appears hitherto to have been he will more or less be the slave of his appetites and those women obtaining most power who gratify a predominant one the sex is degraded by a physical if not by a moral necessity  This objection has I grant some force but while such a sublime precept exists as 'be pure as your heavenly Father is pure' it would seem that the virtues of man are not limited by the Being who alone could limit them and that he may press forward without considering whether he steps out of his sphere by indulging such a noble ambition To the wild billows it has been said  thus far  shalt thou go and no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed  Vainly then do they beat and foam restrained by the power that confines the struggling planets in their orbits matter yields to the great governing SpiritBut an immortal soul not restrained by mechanical laws and struggling to free itself from the shackles of matter contributes to instead of disturbing the order of creation when cooperating with the Father of spirits it tries to govern itself by the invariable rule that in a degree before which our imagination faints the universe is regulated  Besides if women are educated for dependence that is to act according to the will of another fallible being and submit right or wrong to power where are we to stop Are they to be considered as vicegerents allowed to reign over a small domain and answerable for their conduct to a higher tribunal liable to error  It will not be difficult to prove that such delegates will act like men subjected by fear and make their children and servants endure their tyrannical oppression As they submit without reason they will having no fixed rules to square their conduct by be kind or  cruel just as the whim of the moment directs and we ought not to wonder if sometimes galled by their heavy yoke they take a malignant pleasure in resting it on weaker shoulders  But supposing a woman trained up to obedience be married to a sensible man who directs her judgment without making her feel the servility of her subjection to act with as much propriety by this reflected light as can be expected when reason is taken at second hand yet she cannot ensure the life of her protector he may die and leave her with a large family  A double duty devolves on her to educate them in the character of both father and mother to form their principles and secure their property But alas she has never thought much less acted for herself She has only learned to please  In the union of the sexes both pursue one common object but not in the same manner From their diversity in this particular arises the first determinate difference between the moral relations of each The one should be active and strong the other passive and weak it is necessary the one should have both the power and the will and that the other should make little resistance  This principle being established it follows that woman is expressly formed to please the man if the obligation be reciprocal also and the man ought to please in his turn it is not so immediately necessary his great merit is in his power and he pleases merely because he is strong This I must confess is not one of the refined maxims of love it is however one of the laws of nature prior to love itself  If woman be formed to please and be subjected to man it is her place doubtless to render herself agreeable to him instead of challenging his passion The violence of his desires depends on her charms it is by means of these she should urge him to the exertion of those powers which nature hath given him The most successful method of exciting them is to render such exertion necessary by their resistance as in that case selflove is added to desire and the one triumphs in the victory which the other obliged to acquire Hence arise the various modes of attack and defence between the sexes the boldness of one sex and the timidity of the other and in a word that bashfulness and modesty with which nature hath armed the weak in order to subdue the strong  Rousseau's Emilius  I shall make no other comment on this ingenious passage than just to observe that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness  men to depend  gracefully on them yet encumbered with children how is she to obtain another protectora husband to supply the place of reason A rational man for we are not treading on romantic ground though he may think her a pleasing docile creature will not choose to marry a  family  for love when the world  contains many more pretty creatures What is then to become of her She either falls an easy prey to some mean fortunehunter who defrauds her children of their paternal inheritance and renders her miserable or becomes the victim of discontent and blind indulgence Unable to educate her sons or impress them with respect for it is not a play on words to assert that people are never respected though filling an important station who are not respectable she pines under the anguish of unavailing impotent regret The serpent's tooth enters into her very soul and the vices of licentious youth bring her with sorrow if not with poverty also to the grave  This is not an overcharged picture on the contrary it is a very possible case and something similar must have fallen under every attentive eye  I have however taken it for granted that she was welldisposed though experience shews that the blind may as easily be led into a ditch as along the beaten road But supposing no very improbable conjecture that a being only taught to please must still find her happiness in pleasingwhat an example of folly not to say vice will she be to her  innocent daughters The mother will be lost in the coquette and instead of making friends of her daughters view them with eyes askance for they are rivalsrivals more cruel than any other because they invite a comparison and drive her from the throne of beauty who has never thought of a seat on the bench of reason  It does not require a lively pencil or the discriminating outline of a caricature to sketch the domestic miseries and petty vices which such a mistress of a family diffuses Still she only acts as a woman ought to act brought up according to Rousseau's system She can never be reproached for being masculine or turning out of her sphere nay she may observe another of his grand rules and cautiously preserving her reputation free from spot be reckoned a good kind of woman Yet in what respect can she be termed good She abstains it is true without any great struggle from committing gross crimes but how does she fulfil her duties Dutiesin truth she has enough to think of to adorn her body and nurse a weak constitution  With respect to religion she never presumed to judge for herself but conformed as a  dependent creature should to the ceremonies of the church which she was brought up in piously believing that wiser heads than her own have settled that businessand not to doubt is her point of perfection She therefore pays her tythe of mint and cummin and thanks her God that she is not as other women are These are the blessed effects of a good education These the virtues of man's helpmate  O how lovely exclaims Rousseau speaking of Sophia is her ignorance Happy is he who is destined to instruct her She will never pretend to be the tutor of her husband but will be content to be his pupil Far from attempting to subject him to her taste she will accommodate herself to his She will be more estimable to him than if she was learned he will have a pleasure in instructing her  Rousseau's Emilius  I shall content myself with simply asking how friendship can subsist when love expires between the master and his pupil    I must relieve myself by drawing a different picture  Let fancy now present a woman with a tolerable understanding for I do not wish to leave the line of mediocrity whose constitution strengthened by exercise has allowed her body to acquire its full vigour her mind at the same time gradually expanding  itself to comprehend the moral duties of life and in what human virtue and dignity consist  Formed thus by the discharge of the relative duties of her station she marries from affection without losing sight of prudence and looking beyond matrimonial felicity she secures her husband's respect before it is necessary to exert mean arts to please him and feed a dying flame which nature doomed to expire when the object became familiar when friendship and forbearance take place of a more ardent affectionThis is the natural death of love and domestic peace is not destroyed by struggles to prevent its extinction I also suppose the husband to be virtuous or she is still more in want of independent principles  Fate however breaks this tieShe is left a widow perhaps without a sufficient provision but she is not desolate The pang of nature is felt but after time has softened sorrow into melancholy resignation her heart turns to her children with redoubled fondness and anxious to provide for them affection gives a sacred heroic cast to her maternal duties She thinks that not only the eye sees her virtuous efforts from whom all her comfort  now must flow and whose approbation is life but her imagination a little abstracted and exalted by grief dwells on the fond hope that the eyes which her trembling hand closed may still see how she subdues every wayward passion to fulfil the double duty of being the father as well as the mother of her children Raised to heroism by misfortunes she represses the first faint dawning of a natural inclination before it ripens into love and in the bloom of life forgets her sex forgets the pleasure of an awakening passion which might again have been inspired and returned She no longer thinks of pleasing and conscious dignity prevents her from priding herself on account of the praise which her conduct demands Her children have her love and her brightest hopes are beyond the grave where her imagination often strays  I think I see her surrounded by her children reaping the reward of her care The intelligent eye meets hers whilst health and innocence smile on their chubby cheeks and as they grow up the cares of life are lessened by their grateful attention She lives to see the virtues which she endeavoured to plant on principles fixed into habits to see her  children attain a strength of character sufficient to enable them to endure adversity without forgetting their mother's example  The task of life thus fulfilled she calmly waits for the sleep of death and rising from the grave may sayBehold thou gavest me a talentand here are five talents  I wish to sum up what I have said in a few words for I here throw down my gauntlet and deny the existence of sexual virtues not excepting modesty For man and woman truth if I understand the meaning of the word must be the same yet the fanciful female character so prettily drawn by poets and novelists demanding the sacrifice of truth and sincerity virtue becomes a relative idea having no other foundation than utility and of that utility men pretend arbitrarily to judge shaping it to their own convenience  Women I allow may have different duties to fulfil but they are  human  duties and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them I sturdily maintain must be the same  To become respectable the exercise of their understanding is necessary there is no other foundation for independence of character I mean explicitly to say that they must only bow to the authority of reason instead of being the  modest  slaves of opinion  In the superiour ranks of life how seldom do we meet with a man of superiour abilities or even common acquirements The reason appears to me clear the state they are born in was an unnatural one The human character has ever been formed by the employments the individual or class pursues and if the faculties are not sharpened by necessity they must remain obtuse The argument may fairly be extended to women for seldom occupied by serious business the pursuit of pleasure gives that insignificancy to their character which renders the society of the  great  so insipid The same want of firmness produced by a similar cause forces them both to fly from themselves to noisy pleasures and artificial passions till vanity takes place of every social affection and the characteristics of humanity can scarcely be discerned Such are the blessings of civil governments as they are at present organized  that wealth and female softness equally tend to debase mankind and are produced by the same cause but allowing women to be rational creatures they should be incited to acquire virtues which they may call their own for how can a rational being be ennobled by any thing that is not obtained by its  own  exertions  CHAP IV OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE OF DEGRADATION TO WHICH WOMAN IS REDUCED BY VARIOUS CAUSES  THAT woman is naturally weak or degraded by a concurrence of circumstances is I think clear But this position I shall simply contrast with a conclusion which I have frequently heard fall from sensible men in favour of an aristocracy that the mass of mankind cannot be any thing or the obsequious slaves who patiently allow themselves to be penned up would feel their own consequence and spurn their chains Men they further observe submit every where to oppression when they have only to lift up their heads to throw off the yoke yet instead of asserting their birthright they quietly lick the dust and say let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die Women I argue from analogy are degraded by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment and at last despise the  freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain But I must be more explicit  With respect to the culture of the heart it is unanimously allowed that sex is out of the question but the line of subordination in the mental powers is never to be passed over  Into what inconsistencies do men fall when they argue without the compass of principles Women weak women are compared with angels yet a superiour order of beings should be supposed to possess more intellect than man or in what does their superiority consist In the same style to drop the sneer they are allowed to possess more goodness of heart piety and benevolenceI doubt the fact though it be courteously brought forward unless ignorance be allowed to be the mother of devotion for I am firmly persuaded that on an average the proportion between virtue and knowledge is more upon a par than is commonly granted  Only 'absolute in loveliness' the portion of rationality granted to woman is indeed very scanty for denying her genius and judgment it is scarcely possible to divine what remains to characterize intellect  The stamina of immortality if I may be allowed the phrase is the perfectibility of human reason for was man created perfect or did a flood of knowledge break in upon  him when he arrived at maturity that precluded error I should doubt whether his existence would be continued after the dissolution of the body But in the present state of things every difficulty in morals that escapes from human discussion and equally baffles the investigation of profound thinking and the lightning glance of genius is an argument on which I build my belief of the immortality of the soul Reason is consequentially the simple power of improvement or more properly speaking of discerning truth Every individual is in this respect a world in itself More or less may be conspicuous in one being than another but the nature of reason must be the same in all if it be an emanation of divinity the tie that connects the creature with the Creator for can that soul be stamped with the heavenly image that is not perfected by the exercise of its own reason  The brutes says Lord Monboddo remain in the state in which nature has placed them except in so far as their natural instinct is improved by the culture  we  bestow upon them  Yet outwardly ornamented with elaborate care and so adorned to delight man 'that with honour he may love  Vide Milton  ' the  soul of woman is not allowed to have this distinction and man ever placed between her and reason she is always represented as only created to see through a gross medium and to take things on trust But dismissing these fanciful theories and considering woman as a whole let it be what it will instead of a part of man the inquiry is whether she has reason or not If she has which for a moment I will take for granted she was not created merely to be the solace of man and the sexual should not destroy the human character  Into this error men have probably been led by viewing education in a false light not considering it as the first step to form a being advancing gradually towards perfection  This word is not strictly just but I cannot find a better  but only as a preparation for life On this sensual error for I must call it so has the false system of female manners been reared which robs the whole sex of its dignity and classes the brown and fair with the smiling flowers that only adorns the land This has ever been the language of men and the fear of  departing from a supposed sexual character has made even women of superiour sense adopt the same sentiments  'Pleasure's the portion of th'  inferior  kind  'But glory virtue Heaven for  man  design'd  After writing these lines how could Mrs Barbauld write the following ignoble comparison  'To a Lady with some painted flowers'  'Flowers to the fair to you these flowers I bring  'And strive to greet you with an earlier spring  'Flowers  SWEET  and gay and  DELICATE LIKE YOU  'Emblems of innocence and beauty too  'With flowers the Graces bind their yellow hair  'And flowery wreaths consenting lovers wear  'Flowers the sole luxury which nature knew  'In Eden's pure and guiltless garden grew  'To loftier forms are rougher tasks assign'd  'The sheltering oak resists the stormy wind  'The tougher yew repels invading foes  'And the tall pine for future navies grows  'But this soft family to cares unknown  'Were born for pleasure and delight  ALONE    'Gay without toil and lovely without art  'They spring to  CHEER  the sense and  GLAD  the heart  'Nor blush my fair to own you copy these  'Your  BEST  your  SWEETEST  empire  isto PLEASE  '  So the men tell us but virtue must be acquired by  rough  toils and useful struggles with worldly  cares    Thus understanding strictly speaking has been denied to woman and instinct sublimated into wit  and cunning for the purposes of life has been substituted in its stead  The power of generalizing ideas of drawing comprehensive conclusions from individual observations is the only acquirement for an immortal being that really deserves the name of knowledge Merely to observe without endeavouring to account for any thing may in a very incomplete manner serve as the common sense of life but where is the store laid up that is to clothe the soul when it leaves the body  This power has not only been denied to women but writers have insisted that it is inconsistent with a few exceptions with their sexual character Let men prove this and I shall grant that woman only exists for man I must however previously remark that the power of generalizing ideas to any great extent is not very common amongst men or women But this exercise is the true cultivation of the understanding and every thing conspires to render the cultivation of the understanding more difficult in the female than the male world  I am naturally led by this assertion to the main subject of the present chapter and shall  now attempt to point out some of the causes that degrade the sex and prevent women from generalizing their observations  I shall not go back to the remote annals of antiquity to trace the history of woman it is sufficient to allow that she has always been either a slave or a despot and to remark that each of these situations equally retard the progress of reason The grand source of female folly and vice has ever appeared to me to arise from narrowness of mind and the very constitution of civil governments has put almost insuperable obstacles in the way to prevent the cultivation of the female understandingyet virtue can be built on no other foundation The same obstacles are thrown in the way of the rich and the same consequences ensue  Necessity has been proverbially termed the mother of inventionthe aphorism may be extended to virtue It is an acquirement and an acquirement to which pleasure must be sacrificed and who sacrifices pleasure when it is within the grasp whose mind has not been opened and strengthened by adversity or the pursuit of knowledge goaded on by necessityHappy  is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices merely from idleness But if from their birth men and women are placed in a torrid zone with the meridian sun of pleasure darting directly upon them how can they sufficiently brace their minds to discharge the duties of life or even to relish the affections that carry them out of themselves  Pleasure is the business of woman's life according to the present modification of society and while it continues to be so little can be expected from such weak beings Inheriting in a lineal descent from the first fair defect in nature the sovereignty of beauty they have to maintain their power resigned the natural rights which the exercise of reason might have procured them and chosen rather to be shortlived queens than labour to obtain the sober pleasures that arise from equality Exalted by their inferiority this sounds like a contradiction they constantly demand homage as women though experience should teach them that the men who pride themselves upon paying this arbitrary insolent respect to the sex with the most scrupulous  exactness are most inclined to tyrannize over and despise the very weakness they cherish Often do they repeat Mr Hume's sentiments when comparing the French and Athenian character he alludes to women  But what is more singular in this whimsical nation say I to the Athenians is that a frolick of yours during the Saturnalia when the slaves are served by their masters is seriously continued by them through the whole year and through the whole course of their lives accompanied too with some circumstances which still further augment the absurdity and ridicule Your sport only elevates for a few days those whom fortune has thrown down and whom she too in sport may really elevate for ever above you But this nation gravely exalts those whom nature has subjected to them and whose inferiority and infirmities are absolutely incurable The women though without virtue are their masters and so+vereigns  Ah why do women I write with affectionate solicitude condescend to receive a degree of attention and respect from strangers different from that reciprocation of civility  which the dictates of humanity and the politeness of civilization authorise between man and man And why do they not discover when 'in the noon of beauty's power' that they are treated like queens only to be deluded by hollow respect till they are led to resign or not assume their natural prerogatives Confined then in cages like the feathered race they have nothing to do but to plume themselves and stalk with mock majesty from perch to perch It is true they are provided with food and raiment for which they neither toil nor spin but health liberty and virtue are given in exchange But where amongst mankind has been found sufficient strength of mind to enable a being to resign these adventitious prerogatives one who rising with the calm dignity of reason above opinion dared to be proud of the privileges inherent in man And it is vain to expect it whilst hereditary power chokes the affections and nips reason in the bud  The passions of men have thus placed women on thrones and till mankind become more reasonable it is to be feared that women will avail themselves of the power which they attain with the least exertion and which  is the most indisputable They will smile yes they will smile though told that  'In beauty's empire is no mean  'And woman either slave or queen  'Is quickly scorn'd when not ador'd  But the adoration comes first and the scorn is not anticipated  Lewis the XIVth in particular spread factitious manners and caught in a specious way the whole nation in his toils for establishing an artful chain of despotism he made it the interest of the people at large individually to respect his station and support his power And women whom he flattered by a puerile attention to the whole sex obtained in his reign that princelike distinction so fatal to reason and virtue  A king is always a kingand a woman always a woman  And a wit always a wit might be added for the vain fooleries of wits and beauties to obtain attention and make conquests are much upon a par  his authority and her sex ever stand between them and rational converse With a lover I grant she should be so and her sensibility will naturally lead her to endeavour to excite emotion not to gratify  her vanity but her heart This I do not allow to be coquetry it is the artless impulse of nature I only exclaim against the sexual desire of conquest when the heart is out of the question  This desire is not confined to women  I have endeavoured says Lord Chesterfield to gain the hearts of twenty women whose persons I would not have given a fig for  The libertine who in a gust of passion takes advantage of unsuspecting tenderness is a saint when compared with this coldhearted rascal for I like to use significant words Yet only taught to please women are always on the watch to please and with true heroic ardour endeavour to gain hearts merely to resign or spurn them when the victory is decided and conspicuous  I must descend to the minutiae of the subject  I lament that women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to the sex when in fact they are insultingly supporting their own superiority It is not condescension to bow to an inferior So ludicrous in fact do these ceremonies appear to me  that I scarcely am able to govern  muscles when I see a man start with  and serious solicitude to lift a handkerchief or shut a door when the  lady  could have done it herself had she only moved a pace or two  A wild wish has just flown from my heart to my head and I will not stifle it though it may excite a horselaughI do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society unless where love animates the behaviour For this distinction is I am firmly persuaded the foundation of the weakness of character ascribed to woman is the cause why the understanding is neglected whilst accomplishments are acquired with sedulous care and the same cause accounts for their preferring the graceful before the heroic virtues  Mankind including every description wish to be loved and respected for  something  and the common herd will always take the nearest road to the completion of their wishes The respect paid to wealth and beauty is the most certain and unequivocal and of course will always attract the vulgar eye of common minds Abilities and virtues are absolutely necessary to raise men from the middle  rank of life into notice and the natural consequence is notorious the middle rank contains most virtue and abilities Men have thus in one station at least an opportunity of exerting themselves with dignity and of rising by the exertions which really improve a rational creature but the whole female sex are till their character is formed in the same condition as the rich for they are born I now speak of a state of civilization with certain sexual privileges and whilst they are gratuitously granted them few will ever think of works of supererogation to obtain the esteem of a small number of superiour people  When do we hear of women who starting out of obscurity boldly claim respect on account of their great abilities or daring virtues Where are they to be found  To be observed to be attended to to be taken notice of with sympathy complacency and approbation are all the advantages which they seek  True my male readers will probably exclaim but let them before they draw any conclusion recollect that this was not written originally as descriptive of women but of the rich In Dr Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments I have found a  general character of people of rank and fortune that in my opinion might with the greatest propriety be applied to the female sex I refer the sagacious reader to the whole comparison but must be allowed to quote a passage to enforce an argument that I mean to insist on as the one most conclusive against a sexual character For if excepting warriors no great men of any denomination have ever appeared amongst the nobility may it not be fairly inferred that their local situation swallowed up the man and produced a character similar to that of women who are  locallized  if I may be allowed the word by the rank they are placed in by  courtesy  Women commonly called Ladies are not to be contradicted in company are not allowed to exert any manual strength and from them the negative virtues only are expected when any virtues are expected patience docility goodhumour and flexibility virtues incompatible with any vigorous exertion of intellect Besides by living more with each other and being seldom absolutely alone they are more under the influence of sentiments than passions Solitude and reflection are necessary to give to wishes the force of passions and to  enable the imagination to enlarge the object and make it the most desirable The same may be said of the rich they do not sufficiently deal in general ideas collected by impassioned thinking or calm investigation to acquire that strength of character on which great resolves are built But hear what an acute observer says of the great  Do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may acquire the publick admiration or do they seem to imagine that to them as to other men it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood By what important accomplishments is the young nobleman instructed to support the dignity of his rank and to render himself worthy of that superiority over his fellowcitizens to which the virtue of his ancestors had raised them Is it by knowledge by industry by patience by selfdenial or by virtue of any kind As all his words as all his motions are attended to he learns an habitual regard to every circumstance of ordinary behaviour and studies to perform all those small duties with the most exact propriety As he is conscious how much he is observed and how much mankind are  disposed to favour all his inclinations he acts upon the most indifferent occasions with that freedom and elevation which the thought of this naturally inspires His air his manner his deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense of his own superiority which those who are born to inferior station can hardly ever arrive at These are the arts by which he proposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority and to govern their inclinations according to his own pleasure and in this he is seldom disappointed These arts supported by rank and preeminence are upon ordinary occasions sufficient to govern the world Lewis XIV during the greater part of his reign was regarded not only in France but over all Europe as the most perfect model of a great prince But what were the talents and virtues by which he acquired this great reputation Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his undertakings by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they were attended or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with which he pursued them Was it by his extensive knowledge  by his exquisite judgment or by his heroic valour It was by none of these qualities But he was first of all the most powerful prince in Europe and consequently held the highest rank among kings and then says his historian  he surpassed all his courtiers in the gracefulness of his shape and the majestic beauty of his features The sound of his voice noble and affecting gained those hearts which his presence intimidated He had a step and a deportment which could suit only him and his rank and which would have been ridiculous in any other person The embarrassment which he occasioned to those who spoke to him flattered that secret satisfaction with which he felt his own superiority  These frivolous accomplishments supported by his rank and no doubt too by a degree of other talents and virtues which seems however not to have been much above mediocrity established this prince in the esteem of his own age and have drawn even from posterity a good deal of respect for his memory Compared with these in his own times and in his own presence no other virtue  it seems appeared to have any merit Knowledge industry valour and beneficence trembled were abashed and lost all dignity before them  Woman also thus 'in herself complete' by possessing all these  frivolous  accomplishments so changes the nature of things  'That what she wills to do or say  'Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  'All higher knowledge in  her presence  falls  'Degraded Wisdom in discourse with her  'Loses discountenanc'd and like Folly shows  'Authority and Reason on her wait'  And all this is built on her loveliness  In the middle rank of life to continue the comparison men in their youth are prepared for professions and marriage is not considered as the grand feature in their lives whilst women on the contrary have no other scheme to sharpen their faculties It is not business extensive plans or any of the excursive flights of ambition that engross their attention no their thoughts are not employed in rearing such noble structures To rise in the world and have the liberty of running from pleasure to pleasure they must marry advantageously and to this object their  time is sacrificed and their persons often legally prostituted A man when he enters any profession has his eye steadily fixed on some future advantage and the mind gains great strength by having all its efforts directed to one point and full of his business pleasure is considered as mere relaxation whilst women seek for pleasure as the main purpose of existence In fact from the education which they receive from society the love of pleasure may be said to govern them all but does this prove that there is a sex in souls It would be just as rational to declare that the courtiers in France when a destructive system of despotism had formed their character were not men because liberty virtue and humanity were sacrificed to pleasure and vanityFatal passions which have ever domineered over the  whole  race  The same love of pleasure fostered by the whole tendency of their education gives a trifling turn to the conduct of women in most circumstances for instance they are ever anxious about secondary things and on the watch for adventures instead of being occupied by duties  A man when he undertakes a journey has in general the end in view a woman thinks  more of the incidental occurrences the strange things that may possibly occur on the road the impression that she may make on her fellowtravellers and above all she is anxiously intent on the care of the finery that she carries with her which is more than ever a part of herself when going to figure on a new scene when to use an apt French turn of expression she is going to produce a sensationCan dignity of mind exist with such trivial cares  In short women in general as well as the rich of both sexes have acquired all the follies and vices of civilization and missed the useful fruit It is not necessary for me always to premise that I speak of the condition of the whole sex leaving exceptions out of the question Their senses are inflamed and their understandings neglected consequently they become the prey of their senses delicately termed sensibility and are blown about by every momentary gust of feeling They are therefore in a much worse condition than they would be in were they in a state nearer to nature Ever restless and anxious their over exercised sensibility not only renders them uncomfortable themselves but troublesome to use a soft phrase to others  All their thoughts turn on things calculated to excite emotion and feeling when they should reason their conduct is unstable and their opinions are waveringnot the wavering produced by deliberation or progressive views but by contradictory emotions By fits and starts they are warm in many pursuits yet this warmth never concentrated into perseverance soon exhausts itself exhaled by its own heat or meeting with some other fleeting passion to which reason has never given any specific gravity neutrality ensues Miserable indeed must be that being whose cultivation of mind has only tended to inflame its passions A distinction should be made between inflaming and strengthening them The passions thus pampered whilst the judgment is left unformed what can be expected to ensueUndoubtedly a mixture of madness and folly  This observation should not be confined to the  fair  sex however at present I only mean to apply it to them  Novels music poetry and gallantry all tend to make women the creatures of sensation and their character is thus formed during the time they are acquiring accomplishments the only improvement they are excited  by their station in society to acquire This overstretched sensibility naturally relaxes the other powers of the mind and prevents intellect from attaining that sovereignty which it ought to attain to render a rational creature useful to others and content with its own station for the exercise of the understanding as life advances is the only method pointed out by nature to calm the passions  Satiety has a very different effect and I have often been forcibly struck by an emphatical description of damnationwhen the spirit is represented as continually hovering with abortive eagerness round the defiled body unable to enjoy any thing without the organs of sense Yet to their senses are women made slaves because it is by their sensibility that they obtain present power  And will moralists pretend to assert that this is the condition in which one half of the human race should be encouraged to remain with listless inactivity and stupid acquiescence Kind instructors what were we created for To remain it may be said innocent they mean in a state of childhoodWe might as well never have been born unless it were necessary  that we should be created to enable man to acquire the noble privilege of reason the power of discerning good from evil whilst we lie down in the dust from whence we were taken never to rise again  It would be an endless task to trace the variety of meannesses cares and sorrows into which women are plunged by the prevailing opinion that they were created rather to feel than reason and that all the power they obtain must be obtained by their charms and weakness 'Fine by defect and amiably weak' And made by this amiable weakness entirely dependent excepting what they gain by illicit sway on man not only for protection but advice is it surprising that neglecting the duties that reason alone points out and shrinking from trials calculated to strengthen their minds they only exert themselves to give their defects a graceful covering which may serve to heighten their charms in the eye of the voluptuary though it sink them below the scale of moral excellence  Fragile in every sense of the word they are obliged to look up to man for every comfort In the most trifling dangers they cling  to their support with parasitical tenacity piteously demanding succour and their  natural  protector extends his arm or lifts up his voice to guard the lovely tremblerfrom what Perhaps the frown of an old cow or the jump of a mouse a rat would be a serious danger In the name of reason and even common sense what can save such beings from contempt even though they be soft and fair  These fears when not affected may be very pretty but they shew a degree of imbecility that degrades a rational creature in a way women are not aware offor love and esteem are very distinct things  I am fully persuaded that we should hear of none of these infantine airs if girls were allowed to take sufficient exercise and not confined in close rooms till their muscles are relaxed and their powers of digestion destroyed To carry the remark still further if fear in girls instead of being cherished perhaps created was treated in the same manner as cowardice in boys we should quickly see women with more dignified aspects It is true they could not then with equal propriety be termed the sweet flowers that smile  in the walk of man but they would be more respectable members of society and discharge the important duties of life by the light of their own reason  Educate women like men says Rousseau and the more they resemble our sex the less power will they have over us  This is the very point I aim at I do not wish them to have power over men but over themselves  In the same strain have I heard men argue against instructing the poor for many are the forms that aristocracy assumes  Teach them to read and write say they and you take them out of the station assigned them by nature  An eloquent Frenchman has answered them I will borrow his sentiments But they know not when they make man a brute that they may expect every instant to see him transformed into a ferocious beast Without knowledge there can be no morality  Ignorance is a frail base for virtue Yet that it is the condition for which woman was organized has been insisted upon by the writers who have most vehemently argued in favour of the superiority of man a superiority not in degree but essence though  to soften the argument they have laboured to prove with chivalrous generosity that the sexes ought not to be compared man was made to reason woman to feel and that together flesh and spirit they make the most perfect whole by blending happily reason and sensibility into one character  And what is sensibility  Quickness of sensation quickness of perception delicacy  Thus is it defined by Dr Johnson and the definition gives me no other idea than of the most exquisitely polished instinct I discern not a trace of the image of God in either sensation or matter Refined seventy times seven they are still material intellect dwells not there nor will fire ever make lead gold  I come round to my old argument if woman be allowed to have an immortal soul she must have as the employment of life an understanding to improve And when to render the present state more complete though every thing proves it to be but a fraction of a mighty sum she is incited by present gratification to forget her grand destination Nature is counteracted or she was born only to procreate and rot Or granting brutes of every description a soul though  not a reasonable one the exercise of instinct and sensibility may be the step which they are to take in this life towards the attainment of reason in the next so that through all eternity they will lag behind man who why we cannot tell had the power given him of attaining reason in his first mode of existence  When I treat of the peculiar duties of women as I should treat of the peculiar duties of a citizen or father it will be found that I do not mean to insinuate that they should be taken out of their families speaking of the majority  He that hath wife and children says Lord Bacon hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises either of virtue or mischief Certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men  I say the same of women But the welfare of society is not built on extraordinary exertions and were it more reasonably organized there would be still less need of great abilities or heroic virtues  In the regulation of a family in the education of children understanding in an unsophisticated  sense is particularly required strength both of body and mind yet the men who by their writings have most earnestly laboured to domesticate women have endeavoured by arguments dictated by a gross appetite that satiety had rendered fastidious to weaken their bodies and cramp their minds But if even by these sinister methods they really  persuaded  women by working on their feelings to stay at home and fulfil the duties of a mother and mistress of a family I should cautiously oppose opinions that led women to right conduct by prevailing on them to make the discharge of a duty the business of life though reason were insulted Yet and I appeal to experience if by neglecting the understanding they are as much nay more detached from these domestic duties than they could be by the most serious intellectual pursuit though it may be observed that the mass of mankind will never vigorously pursue an intellectual object  The mass of mankind are rather the slaves of their appetites than of their passions  I may be allowed to infer that reason is absolutely necessary to  enable a woman to perform any duty properly and I must again repeat that sensibility is not reason  The comparison with the rich still occurs to me for when men neglect the duties of humanity women will do the same a common stream hurries them both along with thoughtless celerity Riches and honours prevent a man from enlarging his understanding and enervate all his powers by reversing the order of nature which has ever made true pleasure the reward of labour Pleasure enervating pleasure is likewise within women's reach without earning it But till hereditary possessions are spread abroad how can we expect men to be proud of virtue And till they are women will govern them by the most direct means neglecting their dull domestic duties to catch the pleasure that is on the wing of time  'The power of the woman' says some author 'is her sensibility' and men not aware of the consequence do all they can to make this power swallow up every other Those who constantly employ their sensibility will have most for example poets  painters and composers  Men of this description pour it into their compositions to amalgamate the gross materials and moulding them with passion give to the inert body a soul but in woman's imagination love alone concentrates these ethereal beams  Yet when the sensibility is thus increased at the expence of reason and even the imagination why do philosophical men complain of their fickleness The sexual attention of man particularly acts on female sensibility and this sympathy has been exercised from their youth up A husband cannot long pay those attentions with the passion necessary to excite lively emotions and the heart accustomed to lively emotions turns to a new lover or pines in secret the prey of virtue or prudence I mean when the heart has really been rendered susceptible and the taste formed for I am apt to conclude from what I have seen in fashionable life that vanity is oftener fostered than sensibility by the mode of education and the intercourse between the sexes which I have reprobated and that coquetry more frequently proceeds from vanity than from that inconstancy which overstrained sensibility naturally produces  Another argument that has had a great weight with me must I think have some force with every considerate benevolent heart Girls who have been thus weakly educated are often cruelly left by their parents without any provision and of course are dependent on not only the reason but the bounty of their brothers These brothers are to view the fairest side of the question good sort of men and give as a favour what children of the same parents had an equal right to In this equivocal humiliating situation a docile female may remain some time with a tolerable degree of comfort But when the brother marries a probable circumstance from being considered as the mistress of the family she is viewed with averted looks as an intruder an unnecessary burden on the benevolence of the master of the house and his new partner  Who can recount the misery which many unfortunate beings whose minds and bodies are equally weak suffer in such situations unable to work and ashamed to beg The wife a coldhearted narrowminded woman and this is not an unfair supposition for the present mode of education does not tend to enlarge the heart any more than the  understanding is jealous of the little kindness which her husband shews to his relations and her sensibility not rising to humanity she is displeased at seeing the property of  her  children lavished on an helpless sister  These are matters of fact which have come under my eye again and again The consequence is obvious the wife has recourse to cunning to undermine the habitual affection which she is afraid openly to oppose and neither tears nor caresses are spared till the spy is worked out of her home and thrown on the world unprepared for its difficulties or sent as a great effort of generosity or from some regard to propriety with a small stipend and an uncultivated mind into joyless solitude  These two women may be much upon a par with respect to reason and humanity and changing situations might have acted just the same selfish part but had they been differently educated the case would also have been very different The wife would not have had that sensibility of which self is the centre and reason might have taught her not to expect and not even to be flattered by the affection of her husband if it led him to  violate prior duties She would wish not to love him merely because he loved her but on account of his virtues and the sister might have been able to struggle for herself instead of eating the bitter bread of dependence  I am indeed persuaded that the heart as well as the understanding is opened by cultivation and by which may not appear so clear strengthening the organs I am not now talking of momentary flashes of sensibility but of affections And perhaps in the education of both sexes the most difficult task is so to adjust instruction as not to narrow the understanding whilst the heart is warmed by the generous juices of spring just raised by the electric fermentation of the season nor to dry up the feelings by employing the mind in investigations remote from life  With respect to women when they receive a careful education they are either made fine ladies brimful of sensibility and teeming with capricious fancies or mere notable women The latter are often friendly honest creatures and have a shrewd kind of good sense joined with worldly prudence that often render them more useful members of society  than the fine sentimental lady though they possess neither greatness of mind nor taste The intellectual world is shut against them take them out of their family or neighbourhood and they stand still the mind finding no employment for literature affords a fund of amusement which they have never sought to relish but frequently to despise The sentiments and taste of more cultivated minds appear ridiculous even in those whom chance and family connections have led them to love but in mere acquaintance they think it all affectation  A man of sense can only love such a woman on account of her sex and respect her because she is a trusty servant He lets her to preserve his own peace scold the servants and go to church in clothes made of the very best materials A man of her own size of understanding would probably not agree so well with her for he might wish to encroach on her prerogative and manage some domestic concerns himself Yet women whose minds are not enlarged by cultivation or the natural selfishness of sensibility expanded by reflection are very unfit to manage a family for by an undue stretch of power they are always tyrannizing  to support a superiority that only rests on the arbitrary distinction of fortune The evil is sometimes more serious and domestics are deprived of innocent indulgences and made to work beyond their strength in order to enable the notable woman to keep a better table and outshine her neighbours in finery and parade If she attend to her children it is in general to dress them in a costly mannerand whether this attention arises from vanity or fondness it is equally pernicious  Besides how many women of this description pass their days or at least their evenings discontentedly Their husbands acknowledge that they are good managers and chaste wives but leave home to seek for more agreeable may I be allowed to use a significant French word  piquant  society and the patient drudge who fulfils her task like a blind horse in a mill is defrauded of her just reward for the wages due to her are the caresses of her husband and women who have so few resources in themselves do not very patiently bear this privation of a natural right  A fine lady on the contrary has been  taught to look down with contempt on the vulgar employments of life though she has only been incited to acquire accomplishments that rise a degree above sense for even corporeal accomplishments cannot be acquired with any degree of precision unless the understanding has been strengthened by exercise Without a foundation of principles taste is superficial and grace must arise from something deeper than imitation The imagination however is heated and the feelings rendered fastidious if not sophisticated or a counterpoise of judgment is not acquired when the heart still remains artless though it becomes too tender  These women are often amiable and their hearts are really more sensible to general benevolence more alive to the sentiments that civilize life than the squareelbowed family drudge but wanting a due proportion of reflection and selfgovernment they only inspire love and are the mistresses of their husbands whilst they have any hold on their affections and the platonic friends of his male acquaintance These are the fair defects in nature the women who appear to be created not to enjoy the fellowship of man but  to save him from sinking into absolute brutality by rubbing off the rough angles of his character and by playful dalliance to give some dignity to the appetite that draws him to themGracious Creator of the whole human race hast thou created such a being as woman who can trace thy wisdom in thy works and feel that thou alone art by thy nature exalted above herfor no better purposeCan she believe that she was only made to submit to man her equal a being who like her was sent into the world to acquire virtueCan she consent to be occupied merely to please him merely to adorn the earth when her soul is capable of rising to theeAnd can she rest supinely dependent on man for reason when she ought to mount with him the arduous steeps of knowledge  Yet if love be the supreme good let women be only educated to inspire it and let every charm be polished to intoxicate the senses but if they are moral beings let them have a chance to become intelligent and let love to man be only a part of that glowing flame of universal love which after encircling humanity mounts in grateful incense to God  To fulfil domestic duties much resolution is necessary and a serious kind of perseverance that requires a more firm support than emotions however lively and true to nature To give an example of order the soul of virtue some austerity of behaviour must be adopted scarcely to be expected from a being who from its infancy has been made the weathercock of its own sensations Whoever rationally means to be useful must have a plan of conduct and in the discharge of the simplest duty we are often obliged to act contrary to the present impulse of tenderness or compassion Severity is frequently the most certain as well as the most sublime proof of affection and the want of this power over the feelings and of that lofty dignified affection which makes a person prefer the future good of the beloved object to a present gratification is the reason why so many fond mothers spoil their children and has made it questionable whether negligence or indulgence is most hurtful but I am inclined to think that the latter has done most harm  Mankind seem to agree that children should be left under the management of women during their childhood Now from all the observation  that I have been able to make women of sensibility are the most unfit for this task because they will infallibly carried away by their feelings spoil a child's temper The management of the temper the first and most important branch of education requires the sober steady eye of reason a plan of conduct equally distant from tyranny and indulgence yet these are the extremes that people of sensibility alternately fall into always shooting beyond the mark I have followed this train of reasoning much further till I have concluded that a person of genius is the most improper person to be employed in education public or private Minds of this rare species see things too much in masses and seldom if ever have a good temper That habitual cheerfulness termed goodhumour is perhaps as seldom united with great mental powers as with strong feelings And those people who follow with interest and admiration the flights of genius or with cooler approbation suck in the instruction which has been elaborately prepared for them by the profound thinker ought not to be disgusted if they find the former choleric and the latter morose because liveliness of fancy and  a tenacious comprehension of mind are scarcely compatible with that pliant urbanity which leads a man at least to bend to the opinions and prejudices of others instead of roughly confronting them  But treating of education or manners minds of a superior class are not to be considered they may be left to chance it is the multitude with moderate abilities who call for instruction and catch the colour of the atmosphere they breathe This respectable concourse I contend men and women should not have their sensations heightened in the hotbed of luxurious indolence at the expence of their understanding for unless there be a ballast of understanding they will never become either virtuous or free an aristocracy founded on property or sterling talents will ever sweep before it the alternately timid and ferocious slaves of feeling  Numberless are the arguments to take another view of the subject brought forward with a shew of reason because supposed to be deduced from nature that men have used morally and physically to degrade the sex I must notice a few  The female understanding has often been spoken of with contempt as arriving sooner at maturity than the male I shall not answer this argument by alluding to the early proofs of reason as well as genius in Cowley Milton and Pope  Many other names might be added  but only appeal to experience to decide whether young men who are early introduced into company and examples now abound do not acquire the same precocity So notorious is this fact that the bare mentioning of it must bring before people who at all mix in the world the idea of a number of swaggering apes of men whose understandings are narrowed by being brought into the society of men when they ought to have been spinning a top or twirling a hoop  It has also been asserted by some naturalists that men do not attain their full growth and strength till thirty but that women arrive at maturity by twenty I apprehend that they reason on false ground led astray by the male prejudice which deems beauty the perfection of womanmere beauty of features and complexion the vulgar acceptation of the word whilst male beauty is allowed to  have some connection with the mind Strength of body and that character of countenance which the French term a  physionomie  women do not acquire before thirty any more than men The little artless tricks of children it is true are particularly pleasing and attractive yet when the pretty freshness of youth is worn off these artless graces become studied airs and disgust every person of taste In the countenance of girls we only look for vivacity and bashful modesty but the springtide of life over we look for soberer sense in the face and for traces of passion instead of the dimples of animal spirits expecting to see individuality of character the only fastener of the affections  The strength of an affection is generally in the same proportion as the character of the species in the object beloved is lost in that of the individual  We then wish to converse not to fondle to give scope to our imaginations as well as to the sensations of our hearts  At twenty the beauty of both sexes is equal but the libertinism of man leads him to make the distinction and superannuated coquettes are commonly of the same opinion for when they can no longer inspire love  they pay for the vigour and vivacity of youth The French who admit more of mind into their notions of beauty give the preference to women of thirty I mean to say that they allow women to be in their most perfect state when vivacity gives place to reason and to that magestic seriousness of character which marks maturityor the resting point In youth till twenty the body shoots out till thirty the solids are attaining a degree of density and the flexible muscles growing daily more rigid give character to the countenance that is they trace the operations of the mind with the iron pen of fate and tell us not only what powers are within but how they have been employed  It is proper to observe that animals who arrive slowly at maturity are the longest lived and of the noblest species Men cannot however claim any natural superiority from the grandeur of longevity for in this respect nature has not distinguished the male  Polygamy is another physical degradation and a plausible argument for a custom that blasts every domestic virtue is drawn from the wellattested fact that in the countries  where it is established more females are born than males This appears to be an indication of nature and to nature apparently reasonable speculations must yield A further conclusion obviously presented itself if polygamy be necessary woman must be inferior to man and made for him  With respect to the formation of the fetus in the womb we are very ignorant but it appears to me probable that an accidental physical cause may account for this phenomenon and prove it not to be a law of nature I have met with some pertinent observations on the subject in Forster's Account of the Isles of the SouthSea that will explain my meaning After observing that of the two sexes amongst animals the most vigorous and hottest constitution always prevails and produces its kind he adds  If this be applied to the inhabitants of Africa it is evident that the men there accustomed to polygamy are enervated by the use of so many women and therefore less vigorous the women on the contrary are of a hotter constitution not only on account of their more irritable nerves more sensible organization and more lively fancy but likewise because  they are deprived in their matrimony of that share of physical love which in a monogamous condition would all be theirs and thus for the above reasons the generality of children are born females  In the greater part of Europe it has been proved by the most accurate lists of mortality that the proportion of men to women is nearly equal or if any difference takes place the males born are more numerous in the proportion of to  The necessity of polygamy therefore does not appear yet when a man seduces a woman it should I think be termed a  lefthanded  marriage and the man should be  legally  obliged to maintain the woman and her children unless adultery a natural divorcement abrogated the law And this law should remain in force as long as the weakness of women caused the word seduction to be used as an excuse for their frailty and want of principle nay while they depend on man for a subsistence instead of earning it by the exertion of their own hands or heads But these women should not in the full meaning of the relationship be termed wives or the very purpose of marriage would be subverted and  all those endearing charities that flow from personal fidelity and give a sanctity to the tie when neither love nor friendship unites the hearts would melt into selfishness The woman who is faithful to the father of her children demands respect and should not be treated like a prostitute though I readily grant that if it be necessary for a man and woman to live together in order to bring up their offspring nature never intended that a man should have more than one wife  Still highly as I respect marriage as the foundation of almost every social virtue I cannot avoid feeling the most lively compassion for those unfortunate females who are broken off from society and by one error torn from all those affections and relationships that improve the heart and mind It does not frequently even deserve the name of error for many innocent girls become the dupes of a sincere affectionate heart and still more are as it may emphatically be termed  ruined  before they know the difference between virtue and viceand thus prepared by their education for infamy they become infamous Asylums and Magdalenes are not the proper remedies for these abuses It  is justice not charity that is wanting in the world  A woman who has lost her honour imagines that she cannot fall lower and as for recovering her former station it is impossible no exertion can wash this stain away Losing thus every spur and having no other means of support prostitution becomes her only refuge and the character is quickly depraved by circumstances over which the poor wretch has little power unless she possesses an uncommon portion of sense and loftiness of spirit Necessity never makes prostitution the business of men's lives though numberless are the women who are thus rendered systematically vicious This however arises in a great degree from the state of idleness in which women are educated who are always taught to look up to man for a maintenance and to consider their persons as the proper return for his exertions to support them Meretricious airs and the whole science of wantonness has then a more powerful stimulus than either appetite or vanity and this remark gives force to the prevailing opinion that with chastity all is lost that is respectable in woman Her character depends on  the observance of one virtue though the only passion fostered in her heartis love Nay the honour of a woman is not made even to depend on her will  When Richardson  Dr Young supports the same opinion in his plays when he talks of the misfortune that shunned the light of day  makes Clarissa tell Lovelace that he had robbed her of her honour he must have had strange notions of honour and virtue For miserable beyond all names of misery is the condition of a being who could be degraded without its own consent This excess of strictness I have heard vindicated as a salutary error I shall answer in the words of Leibnitz'Errors are often useful but it is commonly to remedy other errors'  Most of the evils of life arise from a desire of present enjoyment that outruns itself The obedience required of women in the marriage state comes under this description the mind naturally weakened by depending on authority never exerts its own powers and the obedient wife is thus rendered a weak indolent mother Or supposing that this is not always the consequence a future state of existence is scarcely taken into the reckoning when  only negative virtues are cultivated For in treating of morals particularly when women are alluded to writers have too often considered virtue in a very limited sense and made the foundation of it  solely  worldly utility nay a still more fragile base has been given to this stupendous fabric and the wayward fluctuating feelings of men have been made the standard of virtue Yes virtue as well as religion has been subjected to the decisions of taste  It would almost provoke a smile of contempt if the vain absurdities of man did not strike us on all sides to observe how eager men are to degrade the sex from whom they pretend to receive the chief pleasure of life and I have frequently with full conviction retorted Pope's sarcasm on them or to speak explicitly it has appeared to me applicable to the whole human race A love of pleasure or sway seems to divide mankind and the husband who lords it in his little harem thinks only of his pleasure or his convenience To such lengths indeed does an intemperate love of pleasure carry some prudent men or worn out libertines who marry to have a safe bedfellow that they seduce their own  wivesHymen banishes modesty and chaste love takes its flight  Love considered as an animal appetite cannot long feed on itself without expiring And this extinction in its own flame may be termed the violent death of love But the wife who has thus been rendered licentious will probably endeavour to fill the void left by the loss of her husband's attentions for she cannot contentedly become merely an upper servant after having been treated like a goddess She is still handsome and instead of transferring her fondness to her children she only dreams of enjoying the sunshine of life Besides there are many husbands so devoid of sense and parental affection that during the first effervescence of voluptuous fondness they refuse to let their wives suckle their children They are only to dress and live to please them and loveeven innocent love soon sinks into lasciviousness when the exercise of a duty is sacrificed to its indulgence  Personal attachment is a very happy foundation for friendship yet when even two virtuous young people marry it would perhaps be happy if some circumstances checked  their passion if the recollection of some prior attachment or disappointed affection made it on one side at least rather a match founded on esteem In that case they would look beyond the present moment and try to render the whole of life respectable by forming a plan to regulate a friendship which only death ought to dissolve  Friendship is a serious affection the most sublime of all affections because it is founded on principle and cemented by time The very reverse may be said of love In a great degree love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom even when inspired by different objects they weaken or destroy each other and for the same object can only be felt in succession The vain fears and fond jealousies the winds which fan the flame of love when judiciously or artfully tempered are both incompatible with the tender confidence and sincere respect of friendship  Love such as the glowing pen of genius has traced exists not on earth or only resides in those exalted fervid imaginations that have sketched such dangerous pictures Dangerous because they not only afford a plausible excuse to the voluptuary who disguises sheer  sensuality under a sentimental veil but as they spread affectation and take from the dignity of virtue Virtue as the very word imports should have an appearance of seriousness if not austerity and to endeavour to trick her out in the garb of pleasure because the epithet has been used as another name for beauty is to exalt her on a quicksand a most insidious attempt to hasten her fall by apparent respect Virtue and pleasure are not in fact so nearly allied in this life as some eloquent writers have laboured to prove Pleasure prepares the fading wreath and mixes the intoxicating cup but the fruit which virtue gives is the recompence of toil and gradually seen as it ripens only affords calm satisfaction nay appearing to be the result of the natural tendency of things it is scarcely observed Bread the common food of life seldom thought of as a blessing supports the constitution and preserves health still feasts delight the heart of man though disease and even death lurk in the cup or dainty that elevates the spirits or tickles the palate The lively heated imagination in the same style draws the picture of love as it draws every other picture with those glowing  colours which the daring hand will steal from the rainbow that is directed by a mind condemned in a world like this to prove its noble origin by panting after unattainable perfection ever pursuing what it acknowledges to be a fleeting dream An imagination of this vigorous cast can give existence to insubstantial forms and stability to the shadowy reveries which the mind naturally falls into when realities are found vapid It can then depict love with celestial charms and dote on the grand ideal objectit can imagine a degree of mutual affection that shall refine the soul and not expire when it has served as a 'scale to heavenly' and like devotion make it absorb every meaner affection and desire In each others arms as in a temple with its summit lost in the clouds the world is to be shut out and every thought and wish that do not nurture pure affection and permanent virtuePermanent virtue alas Rousseau respectable visionary thy paradise would soon be violated by the entrance of some unexpected guest Like Milton's it would only contain angels or men sunk below the dignity of rational creatures Happiness is not material it cannot be seen or  felt Yet the eager pursuit of the good which every one shapes to his own fancy proclaims man the lord of this lower world and to be an intelligential creature who is not to receive but acquire happiness They therefore who complain of the delusions of passion do not recollect that they are exclaiming against a strong proof of the immortality of the soul  But leaving superior minds to correct themselves and pay dearly for their experience it is necessary to observe that it is not against strong persevering passions but romantic wavering feelings that I wish to guard the female heart by exercising the understanding for these paradisaical reveries are oftener the effect of idleness than of a lively fancy  Women have seldom sufficient serious employment to silence their feelings a round of little cares or vain pursuits frittering away all strength of mind and organs they become naturally only objects of senseIn short the whole tenour of female education the education of society tends to render the best disposed romantic and inconstant and the remainder vain and mean In the present state of society this evil can scarcely be remedied  I am afraid in the slightest degree should a more laudable ambition ever gain ground they may be brought nearer to nature and reason and become more virtuous and useful as they grow more respectable  But I will venture to assert that their reason will never acquire sufficient strength to enable it to regulate their conduct whilst the making an appearance in the world is the first wish of the majority of mankind To this weak wish the natural affections and the most useful virtues are sacrificed Girls marry merely to  better themselves  to borrow a significant vulgar phrase and have such perfect power over their hearts as not to permit themselves to  fall in love  till a man with a superiour fortune offers On this subject I mean to enlarge in a future chapter it is only necessary to drop a hint at present because women are so often degraded by suffering the selfish prudence of age to chill the ardour of youth  From the same source flows an opinion that young girls ought to dedicate great part of their time to needlework yet this employment contracts their faculties more than any other that could have been chosen for them by confining their thoughts to their persons  Men order their clothes to be made and have done with the subject women make their own clothes necessary or ornamental and are continually talking about them and their thoughts follow their hands It is not indeed the making of necessaries that weakens the mind but the frippery of dress For when a woman in the lower rank of life makes her husband's and children's clothes she does her duty this is her part of her business but when women work only to dress better than they could otherwise afford it is worse than sheer loss of time To render the poor virtuous they must be employed and women in the middle rank of life did they not ape the fashions of the nobility without catching their ease might employ them whilst they themselves managed their families instructed their children and exercised their own minds Gardening experimental philosophy and literature would afford them subjects to think of and matter for conversation that in some degree would exercise their understandings The conversation of French women who are not so rigidly nailed to their chairs to twist lappets and knot ribbons is frequently superficial but I contend that it is not half so insipid as that of those English women whose time  is spent in making caps bonnets and the whole mischief of trimmings not to mention shopping bargainhunting c c and it is the decent prudent women who are most degraded by these practices for their motive is simply vanity The wanton who exercises her taste to render her person alluring has something more in view  These observations all branch out of a general one which I have before made and which cannot be too often insisted upon for speaking of men women or professions it will be found that the employment of the thoughts shape the character both generally and individually The thoughts of women ever hover round their persons and is it surprising that their persons are reckoned most valuable Yet some degree of liberty of mind is necessary even to form the person and this may be one reason why some gentle wives have so few attractions beside that of sex Add to this sedentary employments render the majority of women sicklyand false notions of female excellence make them proud of this delicacy though it be another fetter that by calling the attention continually to the body cramps the activity of the mind  Women of quality seldom do any of the manual part of their dress consequently only their taste is exercised and they acquire by thinking less of the finery when the business of their toilet is over that ease which seldom appears in the deportment of women who dress merely for the sake of dressing In fact the observation with respect to the middle rank the one in which talents thrive best extends not to women for those of the superior class by catching at least a smattering of literature and conversing more with men on general topics acquire more knowledge than the women who ape their fashions and faults without sharing their advantages With respect to virtue to use the word in a comprehensive sense I have seen most in low life Many poor women maintain their children by the sweat of their brow and keep together families that the vices of the fathers would have scattered abroad but gentlewomen are too indolent to be actively virtuous and are softened rather than refined by civilization Indeed the good sense which I have met with among the poor women who have had few advantages of education and yet have acted heroically strongly confirmed  me in the opinion that trifling employments have rendered woman a trifler Men taking her  'I take her body' says Ranger  body the mind is left to rust so that while physical love enervates man as being his favourite recreation he will endeavour to enslave womanand who can tell how many generations may be necessary to give vigour to the virtue and talents of the freed posterity of abject slaves  Supposing that women are voluntary slavesslavery of any kind is unfavourable to human happiness and improvement  Knox's Essays    In tracing the causes that in my opinion have degraded woman I have confined my observations to such as universally act upon the morals and manners of the whole sex and to me it appears clear that they all spring from want of understanding Whether this arise from a physical or accidental weakness of faculties time alone can determine for I shall not lay any great stress on the example of a few women  Sappho Eloisa Mrs Macaulay the Empress of Russia Madame d'Eon c These and many more may be reckoned exceptions and are not all heroes as well as heroines exceptions to general rules I wish to see women neither heroines nor brutes but reasonable creatures  who from having  received a masculine education have acquired courage and resolution I only contend that the men who have been placed in similar situations have acquired a similar characterI speak of bodies of men and that men of genius and talents have started out of a class in which women have never yet been placed  CHAP V ANIMADVERSIONS ON SOME OF THE WRITERS WHO HAVE RENDERED WOMEN OBJECTS OF PITY BORDERING ON CONTEMPT  THE opinions speciously supported in some modern publications on the female character and education which have given the tone to most of the observations made in a more cursory manner on the sex remain now to be examined  SECT I  I SHALL begin with Rousseau and give a sketch of the character of women in his own words interspersing comments and reflections My comments it is true will all spring from a few simple principles and might have been deduced from what I have already said but the artificial structure has been raised with so much ingenuity that it  seems necessary to attack it in a more circumstantial manner and make the application myself  Sophia says Rousseau should be as perfect a woman as Emilius is a man and to render her so it is necessary to examine the character which nature has given to the sex  He then proceeds to prove that woman ought to be weak and passive because she has less bodily strength than man and from hence infers that she was formed to please and to be subject to him and that it is her duty to render herself  agreeable  to her masterthis being the grand end of her existence  I have already inserted the passage page  Still however to give a little mock dignity to lust he insists that man should not exert his strength but depend on the will of the woman when he seeks for pleasure with her  Hence we deduce a third consequence from the different constitutions of the sexes which is that the strongest should be master in appearance and be dependent in fact on the weakest and that not from any  frivolous practice of gallantry or vanity of protectorship but from an invariable law of nature which furnishing woman with a greater facility to excite desires than she has given man to satisfy them makes the latter dependent on the good pleasure of the former and compels him to endeavour to please in his turn  in order to obtain her consent that he should be strongest  What nonsense  On these occasions the most delightful circumstance a man finds in his victory is to doubt whether it was the woman's weakness that yielded to his superior strength or whether her inclinations spoke in his favour the females are also generally artful enough to leave this matter in doubt The understanding of women answers in this respect perfectly to their constitution so far from being ashamed of their weakness they glory in it their tender muscles make no resistance they affect to be incapable of lifting the smallest burthens and would blush to be thought robust and strong To what purpose is all this Not merely for the sake of appearing delicate but through an artful precaution it is thus they provide  an excuse beforehand and a right to be feeble when they think it expedient  Rousseau's Emilius Vol III p    I have quoted this passage lest my readers should suspect that I warped the author's reasoning to support my own arguments I have already asserted that in educating women these fundamental principles lead to a system of cunning and lasciviousness  Supposing woman to have been formed only to please and be subject to man the conclusion is just she ought to sacrifice every other consideration to render herself agreeable to him and let this brutal desire of selfpreservation be the grand spring of all her actions when it is proved to be the iron bed of fate to fit which her character should be stretched or contracted regardless of all moral or physical distinctions But if as I think may be demonstrated the purposes of even this life viewing the whole are subverted by practical rules built upon this ignoble base I may be allowed to doubt whether woman was created for man and though the cry of irreligion or even atheism be raised against me I will simply declare that were an angel from heaven to tell me  that Moses's beautiful poetical cosmogony and the account of the fall of man were literally true I could not believe what my reason told me was derogatory to the character of the Supreme Being and having no fear of the devil before mine eyes I venture to call this a suggestion of reason instead of resting my weakness on the broad shoulders of the first seducer of my frail sex  It being once demonstrated continues Rousseau that man and woman are not nor ought to be constituted alike in temperament and character it follows of course that they should not be educated in the same manner In pursuing the directions of nature they ought indeed to act in concert but they should not be engaged in the same employments the end of their pursuits should be the same but the means they should take to accomplish them and of consequence their tastes and inclinations should be different  Rousseau's Emilius Vol III p      Whether I consider the peculiar destination of the sex observe their inclinations or remark their duties all things equally  concur to point out the peculiar method of education best adapted to them Woman and man were made for each other but their mutual dependence is not the same The men depend on the women only on account of their desires the women on the men both on account of their desires and their necessities we could subsist better without them than they without us  Rousseau's Emilius Vol III p      For this reason the education of the women should be always relative to the men To please to be useful to us to make us love and esteem them to educate us when young and take care of us when grown up to advise to console us to render our lives easy and agreeable these are the duties of women at all times and what they should be taught in their infancy So long as we fail to recur to this principle we run wide of the mark and all the precepts which are given them contribute neither to their happiness nor our own  P      Girls are from their earliest infancy fond of dress Not content with being pretty  they are desirous of being thought so we see by all their little airs that this thought engages their attention and they are hardly capable of understanding what is said to them before they are to be governed by talking to them of what people will think of their behaviour The same motive however indiscreetly made use of with boys has not the same effect provided they are let to pursue their amusements at pleasure they care very little what people think of them Time and pains are necessary to subject boys to this motive  Whencesoever girls derive this first lesson it is a very good one As the body is born in a manner before the soul our first concern should be to cultivate the former this order is common to both sexes but the object of that cultivation is different In the one sex it is the developement of corporeal powers in the other that of personal charms not that either the quality of strength or beauty ought to be confined exclusively to one sex but only that the order of the cultivation of both is in that respect reversed Women certainly require  as much strength as to enable them to move and act gracefully and men as much address as to qualify them to act with ease    Children of both sexes have a great many amusements in common and so they ought have they not also many such when they are grown up Each sex has also its peculiar taste to distinguish in this particular Boys love sports of noise and activity to beat the drum to whip the top and to drag about their little carts girls on the other hand are fonder of things of show and ornament such as mirrours trinkets and dolls the doll is the peculiar amusement of the females from whence we see their taste plainly adapted to their destination The physical part of the art of pleasing lies in dress and this is all which children are capacitated to cultivate of that art    Here then we see a primary propensity firmly established which you need only to pursue and regulate The little creature will doubtless be very desirous to know  how to dress up her doll to make its sleeveknots its flounces its headdress c she is obliged to have so much recourse to the people about her for their assistance in these articles that it would be much more agreeable to her to owe them all to her own industry Hence we have a good reason for the first lessons that are usually taught these young females in which we do not appear to be setting them a task but obliging them by instructing them in what is immediately useful to themselves And in fact almost all of them learn with reluctance to read and write but very readily apply themselves to the use of their needles They imagine themselves already grown up and think with pleasure that such qualifications will enable them to decorate themselves  This is certainly only an education of the body but Rousseau is not the only man who has indirectly said that merely the person of a  young  woman without any mind unless animal spirits come under that description is very pleasing To render it weak and what some may call beautiful the understanding  is neglected and girls forced to sit still play with dolls and listen to foolish conversationsthe effect of habit is insisted upon as an undoubted indication of nature I know it was Rousseau's opinion that the first years of youth should be employed to form the body though in educating Emilius he deviates from this plan yet the difference between strengthening the body on which strength of mind in a great measure depends and only giving it an easy motion is very wide  Rousseau's observations it is proper to remark were made in a country where the art of pleasing was refined only to extract the grossness of vice He did not go back to nature or his ruling appetite disturbed the operations of reason else he would not have drawn these crude inferences  In France boys and girls particularly the latter are only educated to please to manage their persons and regulate their exterior behaviour and their minds are corrupted at a very early age by the worldly and pious cautions they receive to guard them against immodesty I speak of past times The very confessions which mere children were obliged  to make and the questions asked by the holy men I assert these facts on good authority were sufficient to impress a sexual character and the education of society was a school of coquetry and art At the age of ten or eleven nay often much sooner girls began to coquet and talked unreproved of establishing themselves in the world by marriage  In short they were made women almost from their very birth and compliments were listened to instead of instruction These weakening the mind Nature was supposed to have acted like a stepmother when she formed this afterthought of creation  Not allowing them understanding however it was but consistent to subject them to authority independent of reason and to prepare them for this subjection he gives the following advice  Girls ought to be active and diligent nor is that all they should also be early subjected to restraint This misfortune if it really be one is inseparable from their sex nor do they ever throw it off but to suffer more cruel evils They must be subject all their lives to the most constant and severe restraint which is that of decorum  it is therefore necessary to accustom them early to such confinement that it may not afterwards cost them too dear and to the suppression of their caprices that they may the more readily submit to the will of others If indeed they are fond of being always at work they should be sometimes compelled to lay it aside Dissipation levity and inconstancy are faults that readily spring up from their first propensities when corrupted or perverted by too much indulgence To prevent this abuse we should learn them above all things to lay a due restraint on themselves The life of a modest woman is reduced by our absurd institutions to a perpetual conflict with herself not but it is just that this sex should partake of the sufferings which arise from those evils it hath caused us  And why is the life of a modest woman a perpetual conflict I should answer that this very system of education makes it so Modesty temperance and selfdenial are the sober offspring of reason but when sensibility is nurtured at the expence of the understanding such weak beings must be restrained by arbitrary means and be subjected to continual  conflicts but give their activity of mind a wider range and nobler passions and motives will govern their appetites and sentiments  The common attachment and regard of a mother nay mere habit will make her beloved by her children if she does nothing to incur their hate Even the constraint she lays them under if well directed will increase their affection instead of lessening it because a state of dependence being natural to the sex they perceive themselves formed for obedience  This is begging the question for servitude not only debases the individual but its effects seem to be transmitted to posterity Considering the length of time that women have been dependent is it surprising that some of them hug their chains and fawn like the spaniel  These dogs observes a naturalist at first kept their ears erect but custom has superseded nature and a token of fear is become a beauty  For the same reason adds Rousseau women have or ought to have but little liberty they are apt to indulge themselves excessively in what is allowed them Addicted in every thing to extremes they are  even more transported at their diversions than boys  The answer to this is very simple Slaves and mobs have always indulged themselves in the same excesses when once they broke loose from authorityThe bent bow recoils with violence when the hand is suddenly relaxed that forcibly held it and sensibility the plaything of outward circumstances must be subjected to authority or moderated by reason  There results he continues from this habitual restraint a tractableness which the women have occasion for during their whole lives as they constantly remain either under subjection to the men or to the opinions of mankind and are never permitted to set themselves above those opinions The first and most important qualification in a woman is goodnature or sweetness of temper formed to obey a being so imperfect as man often full of vices and always full of faults she ought to learn betimes even to suffer injustice and to bear the insults of a husband without complaint it is not for his sake but her own that she should be of a mild disposition The perverseness  and illnature of the women only serve to aggravate their own misfortunes and the misconduct of their husbands they might plainly perceive that such are not the arms by which they gain the superiority  Formed to live with such an imperfect being as man they ought to learn from the exercise of their faculties the necessity of forbearance but all the sacred rights of humanity are violated by insisting on blind obedience or the most sacred rights belong  only  to man  The being who patiently endures injustice and silently bears insults will soon become unjust or unable to discern right from wrong Besides I deny the fact this is not the true way to form or meliorate the temper for as a sex men have better tempers than women because they are occupied by pursuits that interest the head as well as the heart and the steadiness of the head gives a healthy temperature to the heart People of sensibility have seldom good tempers The formation of the temper is the cool work of reason when as life advances she mixes with happy art jarring elements I never knew a weak or ignorant person who  had a good temper though that constitutional good humour and that docility which fear stamps on the behaviour often obtains the name I say behaviour for genuine meekness never reached the heart or mind unless as the effect of reflection and that simple restraint produces a number of peccant humours in domestic life many sensible men will allow who find some of these gentle irritable creatures very troublesome companions  Each sex he further argues should preserve its peculiar tone and manner a meek husband may make a wife impertinent but mildness of disposition on the woman's side will always bring a man back to reason at least if he be not absolutely a brute and will sooner or later triumph over him  True the mildness of reason but abject fear always inspires contempt and tears are only eloquent when they flow down fair cheeks  Of what materials can that heart be composed which can melt when insulted and instead of revolting at injustice kiss the rod Is it unfair to infer that her virtue is built on narrow views and selfishness who can caress a man with true feminine softness  the very moment when he treats her tyrannically Nature never dictated such insincerityand though prudence of this sort be termed a virtue morality becomes vague when any part is supposed to rest on falsehood These are mere expedients and expedients are only useful for the moment  Let the husband beware of trusting too implicitly to this servile obedience for if his wife can with winning sweetness caress him when angry and when she ought to be angry unless contempt had stifled a natural effervescence she may do the same after parting with a lover These are all preparations for adultery or should the fear of the world or of hell restrain her desire of pleasing other men when she can no longer please her husband what substitute can be found by a being who was only formed by nature and art to please man what can make her amends for this privation or where is she to seek for a fresh employment where find sufficient strength of mind to determine to begin the search when her habits are fixed and vanity has long ruled her chaotic mind  But this partial moralist recommends cunning systematically and plausibly  Daughters should be always submissive their mothers however should not be inexorable To make a young person tractable she ought not to be made unhappy to make her modest she ought not to be rendered stupid On the contrary I should not be displeased at her being permitted to use some art not to elude punishment in case of disobedience but to exempt herself from the necessity of obeying It is not necessary to make her dependence burdensome but only to let her feel it Subtilty is a talent natural to the sex and as I am persuaded all our natural inclinations are right and good in themselves I am of opinion this should be cultivated as well as the others it is requisite for us only to prevent its abuse  'Whatever is is right' he then proceeds triumphantly to infer Grantedyet perhaps no aphorism ever contained a more paradoxical assertion It is a solemn truth with respect to God He reverentially I speak sees the whole at once and saw its just proportions in the womb of time but man who can only inspect disjointed parts finds many things wrong and it is a part of the  system and therefore right that he should endeavour to alter what appears to him to be so even while he bows to the Wisdom of his Creator and respects the darkness he labours to disperse  The inference that follows is just supposing the principle to be sound  The superiority of address peculiar to the female sex is a very equitable indemnification for their inferiority in point of strength without this woman would not be the companion of man but his slave it is by her superiour art and ingenuity that she preserves her equality and governs him while she affects to obey Woman has every thing against her as well our faults as her own timidity and weakness she has nothing in her favour but her subtilty and her beauty Is it not very reasonable therefore she should cultivate both  Greatness of mind can never dwell with cunning or address for I shall not boggle about words when their direct signification is insincerity and falsehood but content myself with observing that if any class of mankind are to be educated by rules not strictly deducible from truth virtue is an affair of convention How could Rousseau dare to  assert after giving this advice that in the grand end of existence the object of both sexes should be the same when he well knew that the mind formed by its pursuits is expanded by great views swallowing up little ones or that it becomes itself little  Men have superiour strength of body but were it not for mistaken notions of beauty women would acquire sufficient to enable them to earn their own subsistence the true definition of independence and to bear those bodily inconveniencies and exertions that are requisite to strengthen the mind  Let us then by being allowed to take the same exercise as boys not only during infancy but youth arrive at perfection of body that we may know how far the natural superiority of man extends For what reason or virtue can be expected from a creature when the seedtime of life is neglected Nonedid not the winds of heaven casually scatter many useful seeds in the fallow ground  Beauty cannot be acquired by dress and coquetry is an art not so early and speedily attained While girls are yet young however they are in a capacity to study agreeable  gesture a pleasing modulation of voice an easy carriage and behaviour as well as to take the advantage of gracefully adapting their looks and attitudes to time place and occasion Their application therefore should not be solely confined to the arts of industry and the needle when they come to display other talents whose utility is already apparent  For my part I would have a young Englishwoman cultivate her agreeable talents in order to please her future husband with as much care and assiduity as a young Circassian cultivates her's to fit her for the Harem of an Eastern bashaw  To render women completely insignificant he adds  The tongues of women are very voluble they speak earlier more readily and more agreeably than the men they are accused also of speaking much more but so it ought to be and I should be very ready to convert this reproach into a compliment their lips and eyes have the same activity and for the same reason A man speaks of what he knows a woman of what pleases her the one requires knowledge the other taste the principal object of a  man's discourse should be what is useful that of a woman's what is agreeable There ought to be nothing in common between their different conversation but truth  We ought not therefore to restrain the prattle of girls in the same manner as we should that of boys with that severe question  To what purpose are you talking  but by another which is no less difficult to answer  How will your discourse be received  In infancy while they are as yet incapable to discern good from evil they ought to observe it as a law never to say any thing disagreeable to those whom they are speaking to what will render the practice of this rule also the more difficult is that it must ever be subordinate to the former of never speaking falsely or telling an untruth  To govern the tongue in this manner must require great address indeed and it is too much practised both by men and women Out of the abundance of the heart how few speak So few that I who love simplicity would gladly give up politeness for a quarter of the virtue that has been sacrificed to an equivocal quality which at best should only be the polish of virtue  But to complete the sketch  It is easy to be conceived that if male children are not in a capacity to form any true notions of religion those ideas must be greatly above the conception of the females it is for this very reason I would begin to speak to them the earlier on this subject for if we were to wait till they were in a capacity to discuss methodically such profound questions we should run a risk of never speaking to them on this subject as long as they lived Reason in women is a practical reason capacitating them artfully to discover the means of attaining a known end but which would never enable them to discover that end itself The social relations of the sexes are indeed truly admirable from their union there results a moral person of which woman may be termed the eyes and man the hand with this dependence on each other that it is from the man that the woman is to learn what she is to see and it is of the woman that man is to learn what he ought to do If woman could recur to the first principles of things as well as man and man was capacitated to enter into their  minutiae  as  well as woman always independent of each other they would live in perpetual discord and their union could not subsist But in the present harmony which naturally subsists between them their different faculties tend to one common end it is difficult to say which of them conduces the most to it each follows the impulse of the other each is obedient and both are masters  As the conduct of a woman is subservient to the public opinion her faith in matters of religion should for that very reason be subject to authority  Every daughter ought to be of the same religion as her mother and every wife to be of the same religion as her husband for though such religion should be false that docility which induces the mother and daughter to submit to the order of nature take away in the sight of God the criminality of their error  What is to be the consequence if the mother's and husband's opinion should  chance  not to agree An ignorant person cannot be reasoned out of an errorand when  persuaded  to give up one prejudice for another the mind is unsettled Indeed the husband may not have any religion to teach her though in such a situation she will be in great want of a support to her virtue independent of worldly considerations    As  they are not in a capacity to judge for themselves they ought to abide by the decision of their fathers and husbands as confidently as by that of the church  As authority ought to regulate the religion of the women it is not so needful to explain to them the reasons for their belief as to lay down precisely the tenets they are to believe for the creed which presents only obscure ideas to the mind is the source of fanaticism and that which presents absurdities leads to infidelity  Absolute uncontroverted authority it seems must subsist somewhere but is not this a direct and exclusive appropriation of reason The  rights  of humanity have been thus confined to the male line from Adam downwards Rousseau would carry his male aristocracy still further for he insinuates that he should not blame those who contend for leaving woman in a state of the most profound ignorance if it were not necessary in order to preserve her chastity and justify the man's choice in the eyes of the world to give her a little knowledge of men and the customs produced by human passions else she might propagate at home without being rendered less voluptuous and innocent by the exercise of her  understanding excepting indeed during the first year of marriage when she might employ it to dress like Sophia  Her dress is extremely modest in appearance and yet very coquettish in fact she does not make a display of her charms she conceals them but in concealing them she knows how to affect your imagination Every one who sees her will say There is a modest and discreet girl but while you are near her your eyes and affections wander all over her person so that you cannot withdraw them and you would conclude that every part of her dress simple as it seems was only put in its proper order to be taken to pieces by the imagination  Is this modesty Is this a preparation for immortality AgainWhat opinion are we to form of a system of education when the author says of his heroine  that with her doing things well is but a  secondary  concern her principal concern is to do them  neatly    Secondary in fact are all her virtues and qualities for respecting religion he makes her parents thus address her accustomed to submission  Your husband will instruct you in good time  After thus cramping a woman's mind if in order to keep it fair he has not made it quite a blank he advises her to reflect that a reflecting man may not yawn in her company when he is tired of caressing her What has she to reflect about who must obey and would it not be a refinement on cruelty only to open her mind to make the darkness and misery of her fate  visible  Yet these are his sensible remarks how consistent with what I have already been obliged to quote to give a fair view of the subject the reader may determine  They who pass their whole lives in working for their daily bread have no ideas beyond their business or their interest and all their understanding seems to lie in their fingers' ends This ignorance is neither prejudicial to their integrity nor their morals it is often of service to them Sometimes by means of reflexion we are led to compound with our duty and we conclude by substituting a jargon of words in the room of things Our own conscience is the most enlightened philosopher There is no need to be acquainted with Tully's offices to make a man of probity and perhaps the most virtuous woman in the  world is the least acquainted with the definition of virtue But it is no less true that an improved understanding can only render society agreeable and it is a melancholy thing for a father of a family who is fond of home to be obliged to be always wrapped up in himself and to have nobody about him to whom he can impart his sentiments  Besides how should a woman void of reflection be capable of educating her children How should she discern what is proper for them How should she incline them to those virtues she is unacquainted with or to that merit of which she has no idea She can only sooth or chide them render them insolent or timid she will make them formal coxcombs or ignorant blockheads but will never make them sensible or amiable  How indeed should she when her husband is not always at hand to lend her his reasonwhen they both together make but one moral being A blind will  eyes without hands  would go a very little way and perchance his abstract reason that should concentrate the scattered beams of her practical reason may be employed in judging of the  flavour of wine descanting on the sauces most proper for turtle or more profoundly intent at a cardtable he may be generalizing his ideas as he bets away his fortune leaving all the  minutiae  of education to his helpmate or to chance  But granting that woman ought to be beautiful innocent and silly to render her a more alluring and indulgent companion what is her understanding sacrificed for And why is all this preparation necessary only according to Rousseau's own account to make her the mistress of her husband a very short time For no man ever insisted more on the transient nature of love Thus speaks the philosopher  Sensual pleasures are transient The habitual state of the affections always lose by their gratification The imagination which decks the object of our desires is lost in fruition Excepting the Supreme Being who is selfexistent there is nothing beautiful but what is ideal  But he returns to his unintelligible paradoxes again when he thus addresses Sophia  Emilius in becoming your husband is become your master and claims your obedience Such is the order of nature When a man is married however to such a wife  as Sophia it is proper he should be directed by her this is also agreeable to the order of nature it is therefore to give you as much authority over his heart as his sex gives him over your person that I have made you the arbiter of his pleasures It may cost you perhaps some disagreeable selfdenial but you will be certain of maintaining your empire over him if you can preserve it over yourselfwhat I have already observed also shows me that this difficult attempt does not surpass your courage  Would you have your husband constantly at your feet keep him at some distance from your person You will long maintain the authority in love if you know but how to render your favours rare and valuable It is thus you may employ even the arts of coquetry in the service of virtue and those of love in that of reason  I shall close my extracts with a just description of a comfortable couple  And yet you must not imagine that even such management will always suffice Whatever precaution be taken enjoyment will by degrees take off the edge of passion But  when love hath lasted as long as possible a pleasing habitude supplies its place and the attachment of a mutual confidence succeeds to the transports of passion Children often form a more agreeable and permanent connection between married people than even love itself When you cease to be the mistress of Emilius you will continue to be his wife and friend you will be the mother of his children  Rousseau's Emilius    Children he truly observes form a much more permanent connexion between married people than love Beauty he declares will not be valued or even seen after a couple have lived six months together artificial graces and coquetry will likewise pall on the senses why then does he say that a girl should be educated for her husband with the same care as for an eastern harem  I now appeal from the reveries of fancy and refined licentiousness to the good sense of mankind whether if the object of education be to prepare women to become chaste wives and sensible mothers the method so plausibly recommended in the foregoing sketch be the one best calculated to produce those ends Will it be allowed that the surest way  to make a wife chaste is to teach her to practise the wanton arts of a mistress termed virtuous coquetry by the sensualist who can no longer relish the artless charms of sincerity or taste the pleasure arising from a tender intimacy when confidence is unchecked by suspicion and rendered interesting by sense  The man who can be contented to live with a pretty useful companion without a mind has lost in voluptuous gratifications a taste for more refined enjoyments he has never felt the calm satisfaction that refreshes the parched heart like the silent dew of heavenof being beloved by one who could understand himIn the society of his wife he is still alone unless when the man is sunk in the brute  The charm of life says a grave philosophical reasoner is sympathy nothing pleases us more than to observe in other men a fellowfeeling with all the emotions of our own breast  But according to the tenour of reasoning by which women are kept from the tree of knowledge the important years of youth the usefulness of age and the rational hopes of futurity are all to be sacrificed to render women an object of desire for a  short  time Besides how could Rousseau expect them to  be virtuous and constant when reason is neither allowed to be the foundation of their virtue nor truth the object of their inquiries  But all Rousseau's errors in reasoning arose from sensibility and sensibility to their charms women are very ready to forgive When he should have reasoned he became impassioned and reflection inflamed his imagination instead of enlightening his understanding Even his virtues also led him farther astray for born with a warm constitution and lively fancy nature carried him toward the other sex with such eager fondness that he soon became lascivious Had he given way to these desires the fire would have extinguished itself in a natural manner but virtue and a romantic kind of delicacy made him practise selfdenial yet when fear delicacy or virtue restrained him he debauched his imagination and reflecting on the sensations to which fancy gave force he traced them in the most glowing colours and sunk them deep into his soul  He then sought for solitude not to sleep with the man of nature or calmly investigate the causes of things under the shade where Sir Isaac Newton indulged contemplation but merely to indulge his feelings And so warmly  has he painted what he forcibly felt that interesting the heart and inflaming the imagination of his readers in proportion to the strength of their fancy they imagine that their understanding is convinced when they only sympathize with a poetic writer who skilfully exhibits the objects of sense most voluptuously shadowed or gracefully veiled And thus making us feel whilst dreaming that we reason erroneous conclusions are left in the mind  Why was Rousseau's life divided between ecstasy and misery Can any other answer be given than this that the effervescence of his imagination produced both but had his fancy been allowed to cool it is possible that he might have acquired more strength of mind Still if the purpose of life be to educate the intellectual part of man all with respect to him was right yet had not death led to a nobler scene of action it is probable that he would have enjoyed more equal happiness on earth and have felt the calm sensations of the man of nature instead of being prepared for another stage of existence by nourishing the passions which agitate the civilized man  But peace to his manes I war not with  his ashes but his opinions I war only with the sensibility that led him to degrade woman by making her the slave of love  'Curs'd vassalage  'First idoliz'd till love's hot fire be o'er  'Then slaves to those who courted us before'  Dryden  The pernicious tendency of those books in which the writers insidiously degrade the sex whilst they are prostrate before their personal charms cannot be too often or too severely exposed  Let us my dear contemporaries arise above such narrow prejudices If wisdom is desirable on its own account if virtue to deserve the name must be founded on knowledge let us endeavour to strengthen our minds by reflexion till our heads become a balance for our hearts let us not confine all our thoughts to the petty occurrences of the day nor our knowledge to an acquaintance with our lovers' or husbands' hearts but let the practice of every duty be subordinate to the grand one of improving our minds and preparing our affections for a more exalted state  Beware then my friends of suffering the heart to be moved by every trivial incident  the reed is shaken by a breeze and annually dies but the oak stands firm and for ages braves the storm  Were we indeed only created to flutter our hour out and diewhy let us then indulge sensibility and laugh at the severity of reasonYet alas even then we should want strength of body and mind and life would be lost in feverish pleasures or wearisome languor  But the system of education which I earnestly wish to see exploded seems to presuppose what ought never to be taken for granted that virtue shields us from the casualties of life and that fortune slipping off her bandage will smile on a welleducated female and bring in her hand an Emilius or a Telemachus Whilst on the contrary the reward which virtue promises to her votaries is confined it is clear to their own bosoms and often must they contend with the most vexatious worldly cares and bear with the vices and humours of relations for whom they can never feel a friendship  There have been many women in the world who instead of being supported by the reason and virtue of their fathers and brothers  have strengthened their own minds by struggling with their vices and follies yet have never met with a hero in the shape of a husband who paying the debt that mankind owed them might chance to bring back their reason to its natural dependent state and restore the usurped prerogative of rising above opinion to man  SECT II  DR FORDYCE'S sermons have long made a part of a young woman's library nay girls at school are allowed to read them but I should instantly dismiss them from my pupil's if I wished to strengthen her understanding by leading her to form sound principles on a broad basis or were I only anxious to cultivate her taste though they must be allowed to contain many sensible observations  Dr Fordyce may have had a very laudable end in view but these discourses are written in such an affected style that were it only on that account and had I nothing to object against his  mellifluous  precepts I should not allow girls to peruse them unless I designed  to hunt every spark of nature out of their composition melting every human quality into female meekness and artificial grace I say artificial for true grace arises from some kind of independence of mind  Children careless of pleasing and only anxious to amuse themselves are often very graceful and the nobility who have mostly lived with inferiours and always had the command of money acquire a graceful ease of deportment which should rather be termed habitual grace of body than that superiour gracefulness which is truly the expression of the mind This mental grace not noticed by vulgar eyes often flashes across a rough countenance and irradiating every feature shows simplicity and independence of mind It is then we read characters of immortality in the eye and see the soul in every gesture though when at rest neither the face nor limbs may have much beauty to recommend them or the behaviour any thing peculiar to attract universal attention The mass of mankind however look for more  tangible  beauty yet simplicity is in general admired when people do not consider what they admire and can there be simplicity without sincerity But to have done with remarks  that are in some measure desultory though naturally excited by the subject  In declamatory periodsâ–ª Dr Fordyce spins out Rousseau's eloquence and in most sentimental rant details his opinions respecting the female character and the behaviour which woman ought to assume to render her lovely  He shall speak for himself for thus he makes Nature address man  Behold these smiling innocents whom I have graced with my fairest gifts and committed to your protection behold them with love and respect treat them with tenderness and honour They are timid and want to be defended They are frail O do not take advantage of their weakness Let their fears and blushes endear them Let their confidence in you never be abused But is it possible that any of you can be such barbarians so supremely wicked as to abuse it Can you find in your hearts  Can youCan you would be the most emphatical comment were it drawled out in a whining voice  to despoil the gentle trusting creatures of their treasure or do any thing to strip them of their native robe of virtue Curst be the impious hand that would dare to violate the unblemished form of Chastity Thou  wretch thou ruffian forbear nor venture to provoke heaven's fiercest vengeance  I know not any comment that can be made seriously on this curious passage and I could produce many similar ones and some so very sentimental that I have heard rational men use the word indecent when they mentioned them with disgust  Throughout there is a display of cold artificial feelings and that parade of sensibility which boys and girls should be taught to despise as the sure mark of a little vain mind Florid appeals are made to heaven and to the  beauteous innocents  the fairest image of heaven here below whilst sober sense is left far behindThis is not the language of the heart nor will it ever reach it though the ear may be tickled  I shall be told perhaps that the public have been pleased with these volumesTrue and Hervey's Meditations are still read though he equally sinned against sense and taste  I particularly object to the loverlike phrases of pumped up passion which are every where interspersed If women be ever allowed to walk without leadingstrings why must they  be cajoled into virtue by artful flattery and sexual complimentsSpeak to them the language of truth and soberness and away with the lullaby strains of condescending endearment Let them be taught to respect themselves as rational creatures and not led to have a passion for their own insipid persons It moves my gall to hear a preacher descanting on dress and needlework and still more to hear him address the  British fair the fairest of the fair  as if they had only feelings  Even recommending piety he uses the following argument  Never perhaps does a fine woman strike more deeply than when composed into pious recollection and possessed with the noblest considerations she assumes without knowing it superiour dignity and new graces so that the beauties of holiness seem to radiate about her and the bystanders are almost induced to fancy her already worshipping amongst her kindred angels  Why are women to be thus bred up with a desire of conquest the very epithet used in this sense gives me a sickly qualm Does religion and virtue offer no stronger motives no brighter reward Must they always be debased by being made  to consider the sex of their companions Must they be taught always to be pleasing And when levelling their small artillery at the heart of man is it necessary to tell them that a little sense is sufficient to render their attention  incredibly soothing  As a small degree of knowledge entertains in a woman so from a woman though for a different reason a small expression of kindness delights particularly if she have beauty  I should have supposed for the same reason  Why are girls to be told that they resemble angels but to sink them below women Or that a gentle innocent female is an object that comes nearer to the idea which we have formed of angels than any other Yet they are told at the same time that they are only like angels when they are young and beautiful consequently it is their persons not their virtues that procures them this homage  Idle empty words What can such delusive flattery lead to but vanity and folly The lover it is true has a poetic licence to exalt his mistress his reason is the bubble of his passion and he does not utter a falsehood when he borrows the language of adoration His imagination may raise the idol of his  heart unblamed above humanity and happy would it be for women if they were only flattered by the men who loved them I mean who love the individual not the sex but should a grave preacher interlard his discourses with such fooleries  In sermons or novels however voluptuousness is always true to its text Men are allowed by moralists to cultivate as Nature directs different qualities and assume the different characters that the same passions modified almost to infinity give to each individual A virtuous man may have a choleric or a sanguine constitution be gay or grave unreproved be firm till he is almost overbearing or weakly submissive have no will or opinion of his own but all women are to be levelled by meekness and docility into one character of yielding softness and gentle compliance  I will use the preacher's own words  Let it be observed that in your sex manly exercises are never graceful that in them a tone and figure as well as an air and deportment of the masculine kind are always forbidding and that men of sensibility desire in every woman soft features and a  flowing voice a form not robust and demeanour delicate and gentle  Is not the following portraitthe portrait of a house slave  I am astonished at the folly of many women who are still reproaching their husbands for leaving them alone for preferring this or that company to theirs for treating them with this and the other mark of disregard or indifference when to speak the truth they have themselves in a great measure to blame Not that I would justify the men in any thing wrong on their part But had you behaved to them with more  respectful observance  and a more  equal tenderness studying their humours overlooking their mistakes submitting to their opinions  in matters indifferent passing by little instances of unevenness caprice or passion giving  soft  answers to hasty words complaining as seldom as possible and making it your daily care to relieve their anxieties and prevent their wishes to enliven the hour of dulness and call up the ideas of felicity had you pursued this conduct I doubt not but you would have maintained and even increased their esteem so far as to have secured every degree of influence that could  conduce to their virtue or your mutual satisfaction and your house might at this day have been the abode of domestic bliss  Such a woman ought to be an angelor she is an assfor I discern not a trace of the human character neither reason nor passion in this domestic drudge whose being is absorbed in that of a tyrant's  Still Dr Fordyce must have very little acquaintance with the human heart if he really supposed that such conduct would bring back wandering love instead of exciting contempt No beauty gentleness c c may gain a heart but esteem the only lasting affection can alone be obtained by virtue supported by reason It is respect for the understanding that keeps alive tenderness for the person  As these volumes are so frequently put into the hands of young people I have taken more notice of them than strictly speaking they deserve but as they have contributed to vitiate the taste and enervate the understanding of many of my fellowcreatures I could not pass them silently over  SECT III  SUCH paternal solicitude pervades Dr Gregory's Legacy to his Daughters that I enter on the task of criticism with affectionate respect but as this little volume has many attractions to recommend it to the notice of the most respectable part of my sex I cannot silently pass over arguments that so speciously support opinions which I think have had the most baneful effect on the morals and manners of the female world  His easy familiar style is particularly suited to the tenor of his advice and the melancholy tenderness which his respect for the memory of a beloved wife diffuses through the whole work renders it very interesting yet there is a degree of concise elegance conspicuous in many passages that disturbs this sympathy and we pop on the author when we only expected to meet thefather  Besides having two objects in view he seldom adhered steadily to either for wishing to make his daughters amiable and fearing lest unhappiness should only be the consequence of instilling sentiments that might  draw them out of the track of common life without enabling them to act with consonant independence and dignity he checks the natural flow of his thoughts and neither advises one thing nor the other  In the preface he tells them a mournful truth 'that they will hear at least once in their lives the genuine sentiments of a man who has no interest in deceiving them'  Hapless woman what can be expected from thee when the beings on whom thou art said naturally to depend for reason and support have all an interest in deceiving thee This is the root of the evil that has shed a corroding mildew on all thy virtues and blighting in the bud thy opening faculties has rendered thee the weak thing thou art It is this separate interestthis insidious state of warfare that undermines morality and divides mankind  If love have made some women wretched how many more has the cold unmeaning intercourse of gallantry rendered vain and useless yet this heartless attention to the sex is reckoned so manly so polite that till society is very differently organized I fear this vestige of gothic manners will not be done away by  a more reasonable and affectionate mode of conduct Besides to strip it of its imaginary dignity I must observe that in the most uncivilized European states this lipservice prevails in a very great degree accompanied with extreme dissoluteness of morals In Portugal the country that I particularly allude to it takes place of the most serious moral obligations for a man is seldom assassinated when in the company of a woman The savage hand of rapine is unnerved by this chivalrous spirit and if the stroke of vengeance cannot be stayedthe lady is entreated to pardon the rudeness and depart in peace though sprinkled perhaps with her husband's or brother's blood  I shall pass over his strictures on religion because I mean to discuss that subject in a separate chapter  The remarks relative to behaviour though many of them very sensible I entirely disapprove of because it appears to me to be beginning as it were at the wrong end A cultivated understanding and an affectionate heart will never want starched rules of decorumsomething more substantial than seemliness will be the result and without understanding  the behaviour here recommended would be rank affectation Decorum indeed is the one thing needfuldecorum is to supplant nature and banish all simplicity and variety of character out of the female world Yet what good end can all this superficial counsel produce It is however much easier to point out this or that mode of behaviour than to set the reason to work but when the mind has been stored with useful knowledge and strengthened by being employed the regulation of the behaviour may safely be left to its guidance  Why for instance should the following caution be given when art of every kind must contaminate the mind and why entangle the grand motives of action which reason and religion equally combine to enforce with pitiful worldly shifts and slight of hand tricks to gain the applause of gaping tasteless fools  Be even cautious in displaying your good sense  Let women once acquire good senseand if it deserve the name it will teach them or of what use will it be how to employ it  It will be thought you assume a superiority over the rest of the company But if you happen to have any learning  keep it a profound secret especially from the men who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts and a cultivated understanding  If men of real merit as he afterwards observes are superior to this meanness where is the necessity that the behaviour of the whole sex should be modulated to please fools or men who having little claim to respect as individuals choose to keep close in their phalanx Men indeed who insist on their common superiority having only this sexual superiority are certainly very excusable  There would be no end to rules for behaviour if it be proper always to adopt the tone of the company for thus for ever varying the key a  flat  would often pass for a  natural  note  Surely it would have been wiser to have advised women to improve themselves till they rose above the fumes of vanity and then to let the public opinion come round for where are rules of accommodation to stop The narrow path of truth and virtue inclines neither to the right nor leftit is a straightforward business and they who are earnestly  pursuing their road may bound over many decorous prejudices without leaving modesty behind Make the heart clean and give the head employment and I will venture to predict that there will be nothing offensive in the behaviour  The air of fashion which many young people are so eager to attain always strikes me like the studied attitudes of some modern prints copied with tasteless servility after the antiquesthe soul is left out and none of the parts are tied together by what may properly be termed character This varnish of fashion which seldom sticks very close to sense may dazzle the weak but leave nature to itself and it will seldom disgust the wise Besides when a woman has sufficient sense not to pretend to any thing which she does not understand in some degree there is no need of determining to hide her talents under a bushel Let things take their natural course and all will be well  It is this system of dissimulation throughout the volume that I despise Women are always to  seem  to be this and thatyet virtue might apostrophize them in the words of  HamletSeems I know not seemsHave that within that passeth show  Still the same tone occurs for in another place after recommending without sufficiently discriminating delicacy he adds  The men will complain of your reserve They will assure you that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable But trust me they are not sincere when they tell you soI acknowledge that on some occasions it might render you more agreeable as companions but it would make you less amiable as women an important distinction which many of your sex are not aware of    This desire of being always women is the very consciousness that degrades the sex Excepting with a lover I must repeat with emphasis a former observationit would be well if they were only agreeable or rational companionsBut in this respect his advice is even inconsistent with a passage which I mean to quote with the most marked approbation  The sentiment that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms provided her virtue is secure is both grossly indelicate and dangerous  and has proved fatal to many of your sex  With this opinion I perfectly coincide A man or a woman of any feeling must always wish to convince a beloved object that it is the caresses of the individual not the sex that is received and returned with pleasure and that the heart rather than the senses is moved Without this natural delicacy love becomes a selfish personal gratification that soon degrades the character  I carry this sentiment still further Affection when love is out of the question authorises many personal endearments that naturally flowing from an innocent heart give life to the behaviour but the personal intercourse of appetite gallantry or vanity is despicable When a man squeezes the hand of a pretty woman handing her to a carriage whom he has never seen before she will consider such an impertinent freedom in the light of an insult if she have any true delicacy instead of being flattered by this unmeaning homage to beauty These are the privileges of friendship or the momentary homage which the heart pays to virtue when  it flashes suddenly on the noticemere animal spirits have no claim to the kindnesses of affection  Wishing to feed the affections with what is now the food of vanity I would fain persuade my sex to act from simpler principles Let them merit love and they will obtain it though they may never be told that  The power of a fine woman over the hearts of men of men of the finest parts is even beyond what she conceives  I have already noticed the narrow cautions with respect to duplicity female softness delicacy of constitution for these are the changes which he rings round without ceasingin a more decorous manner it is true than Rousseau but it all comes home to the same point and whoever is at the trouble to analyze these sentiments will find the first principles not quite so delicate as the superstructure  The subject of amusements is treated in too cursory a manner but with the same spirit  When I treat of friendship love and marriage it will be found that we materially differ in opinion I shall not then forestall what I have to observe on these important  subjects but confine my remarks to the general tenor of them to that cautious family prudence to those confined views of partial unenlightened affection which exclude pleasure and improvement by vainly wishing to ward off sorrow and errorand by thus guarding the heart and mind destroy also all their energyIt is far better to be often deceived than never to trust to be disappointed in love than never to love to lose a husband's fondness than forfeit his esteem  Happy would it be for the world and for individuals of course if all this unavailing solicitude to attain worldly happiness on a confined plan were turned into an anxious desire to improve the understanding  Wisdom is the principal thing  therefore  get wisdom and with all thy gettings get understanding    How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and hate knowledge  Saith Wisdom to the daughters of men  SECT IV  I DO not mean to allude to all the writers who have written on the subject of female mannersit would in fact be only beating over the old ground for they have in general written in the same strain but attacking the boasted prerogative of manthe prerogative that may emphatically be called the iron sceptre of tyranny the original sin of tyrants I declare against all power built on prejudices however hoary  If the submission demanded be founded on justicethere is no appealing to a higher powerfor God is Justice itself Let us then as children of the same parent if not bastardized by being the younger born reason together and learn to submit to the authority of reasonwhen her voice is distinctly heard But if it be proved that this throne of prerogative only rests on a chaotic mass of prejudices that have no inherent principle of order to keep them together or on an elephant tortoise or even the mighty shoulders of a son of the earth they may escape who  dare to brave the consequence without any breach of duty without sinning against the order of things  Whilst reason raises man above the brutal herd and death is big with promises they alone are subject to blind authority who have no reliance on their own strength They are freewho will be free  'He is the free man whom the  truth  makes free'  Cowper  '  The being who can govern itself has nothing to fear in life but if any thing is dearer than its own respect the price must be paid to the last farthing Virtue like every thing valuable must be loved for herself alone or she will not take up her abode with us She will not impart that peace  which passeth understanding  when she is merely made the stilts of reputation and respected with pharisaical exactness because  honesty is the best policy  That the plan of life which enables us to carry some knowledge and virtue into another world is the one best calculated to ensure content in this cannot be denied yet few people act according to this principle though it be universally allowed that it admit not  of dispute Present pleasure or present power carry before it these sober convictions and it is for the day not for life that man bargains with happiness How few how very few have sufficient foresight or resolution to endure a small evil at the moment to avoid a greater hereafter  Woman in particular whose virtue  I mean to use a word that comprehends more than chastity the sexual virtue  is built on mutable prejudices seldom attains to this greatness of mind so that becoming the slave of her own feelings she is easily subjugated by those of others Thus degraded her reason her misty reason is employed rather to burnish than to snap her chains  Indignantly have I heard women argue in the same track as men and adopt the sentiments that brutalize them with all the pertinacity of ignorance  I must illustrate my assertion by a few examples Mrs Piozzi who often repeated by rote what she did not understand comes forward with Johnsonian periods  Seek not for happiness in singularity and dread a refinement of wisdom as a deviation into folly  Thus she dogmatically  addresses a new married man and to elucidate this pompous exordium she adds  I said that the person of your lady would not grow more pleasing to you but pray let her never suspect that it grows less so that a woman will pardon an affront to her understanding much sooner than one to her person is well known nor will any of us contradict the assertion All our attainments all our arts are employed to gain and keep the heart of man and what mortification can exceed the disappointment if the end be not obtained There is no reproof however pointed no punishment however severe that a woman of spirit will not prefer to neglect and if she can endure it without complaint it only proves that she means to make herself amends by the attention of others for the slights of her husband  These are truly masculine sentiments  All our  arts  are employed to gain and keep the heart of man  and what is the inferenceif her person and was there ever a person though formed with Medicisan symmetry that was not slighted be neglected she will make herself amends by endeavouring to please other men Noble morality  But thus is the understanding of the whole sex affronted and their virtue deprived of the common basis of virtue A woman must know that her person cannot be as pleasing to her husband as it was to her lover and if she be offended with him for being a human creature she may as well whine about the loss of his heart as about any other foolish thingAnd this very want of discernment or unreasonable anger proves that he could not change his fondness for her person into affection for her virtues or respect for her understanding  Whilst women avow and act up to such opinions their understandings at least deserve the contempt and obloquy that men  who never  insult their persons have pointedly levelled at the female mind And it is the sentiments of these polite men who do not wish to be encumbered with mind that vain women thoughtlessly adopt Yet they should know that insulted reason alone can spread that  sacred  reserve about the person which renders human affections for human affections have always some base alloy as permanent as is consistent with the grand end of existencethe attainment of virtue  The Baroness de Stael speaks the same language as the lady just cited with more enthusiasm Her eulogium on Rousseau was accidentally put into my hands and her sentiments the sentiments of too many of my sex may serve as the text for a few comments  Though Rousseau she observes has endeavoured to prevent women from interfering in public affairs and acting a brilliant part in the theatre of politics yet in speaking of them how much has he done it to their satisfaction If he wished to deprive them of some rights foreign to their sex how has he for ever restored to them all those to which it has a claim And in attempting to diminish their influence over the deliberations of men how sacredly has he established the empire they have over their happiness In aiding them to descend from an usurped throne he has firmly seated them upon that to which they were destined by nature and though he be full of indignation against them when they endeavour to resemble men yet when they come before him with all the  charms weaknesses virtues  and  errors  of their sex his respect for their  persons  amounts almost to  adoration  TrueFor never was there a sensualist who paid more fervent adoration at the shrine of beauty So devout indeed was his respect for the person that excepting the virtue of chastity for obvious reasons he only wished to see it embellished by charms weaknesses and errors He was afraid lest the austerity of reason should disturb the soft playfulness of love The master wished to have a meretricious slave to fondle entirely dependent on his reason and bounty he did not want a companion whom he should be compelled to esteem or a friend to whom he could confide the care of his children's education should death deprive them of their father before he had fulfilled the sacred task He denies woman reason shuts her out from knowledge and turns her aside from truth yet his pardon is granted because 'he admits the passion of love' It would require some ingenuity to shew why women were to be under such an obligation to him for thus admitting love when it is clear that he admits it only for the relaxation of men and to perpetuate the species but he talked with passion and that powerful spell worked on the sensibility of a young  encomiast  What signifies it pursues this rhapsodist to women that his reason disputes with them the empire when his heart is devoutedly theirs  It is not empirebut equality that they should contend for Yet if they only wished to lengthen out their sway they should not entirely trust to their persons for though beauty may gain a heart it cannot keep it even while the beauty is in full bloom unless the mind lend at least some graces  When women are once sufficiently enlightened to discover their real interest on a grand scale they will I am persuaded be very ready to resign all the prerogatives of love that are not mutual speaking of them as lasting prerogatives for the calm satisfaction of friendship and the tender confidence of habitual esteem Before marriage they will not assume any insolent airs nor afterwards abjectly submit but endeavouring to act like reasonable creatures in both situations they will not be tumbled from a throne to a stool  Madame Genlis has written several entertaining books for children and her Letters on Education afford many useful hints that  sensible parents will certainly avail themselves of but her views are narrow and her prejudices as unreasonable as strong  I shall pass over her vehement argument in favour of the eternity of future punishments because I blush to think that a human being should ever argue vehemently in such a cause and only make a few remarks on her absurd manner of making the parental authority supplant reason For every where does she inculcate not only  blind  submission to parents but to the opinion of the world  A person is not to act in this or that way though convinced they are right in so doing because some equivocal circumstances may lead the world to  suspect  that they acted from different motivesThis is sacrificing the substance for a shadow Let people but watch their own hearts and act rightly as far as they can judge and they may patiently wait till the opinion of the world comes round It is best to be directed by a simple motivefor justice has too often been sacrificed to proprietyanother word for convenience    She tells a story of a young man engaged by his father's express desire to a girl of fortune Before the marriage could take place she is deprived of her fortune and thrown friendless on the world The father practises the most infamous arts to separate his  son from her and when the son detects his villany and following the dictates of honour marries the girl nothing but misery ensues because forsooth he married  without  his father's consent On what ground can religion or morality rest when justice is thus set at defiance In the same style she represents an accomplished young woman as ready to marry any body that her  mamma  pleased to recommend and as actually marrying the young man of her own choice without feeling any emotions of passion because that a well educated girl had not time to be in love Is it possible to have much respect for a system of education that thus insults reason and nature  Many similar opinions occur in her writings mixed with sentiments that do honour to her head and heart Yet so much superstition is mixed with her religion and so much worldly wisdom with her morality that I should not let a young person read her works unless I could afterwards converse on the subjects and point out the contradictions  Mrs Chapone's Letters are written with such good sense and unaffected humility and contain so many useful observations that  I only mention them to pay the worthy writer this tribute of respect I cannot it is true always coincide in opinion with her but I always respect her  The very word respect brings Mrs Macaulay to my remembrance The woman of the greatest abilities undoubtedly that this country has ever producedAnd yet this woman has been suffered to die without sufficient respect being paid to her memory  Posterity however will be more just and remember that Catharine Macaulay was an example of intellectual acquirements supposed to be incompatible with the weakness of her sex In her style of writing indeed no sex appears for it is like the sense it conveys strong and clear  I will not call her's a masculine understanding because I admit not of such an arrogant assumption of reason but I contend that it was a sound one and that her judgment the matured fruit of profound thinking was a proof that a woman can acquire judgment in the full extent of the word Possessing more penetration than sagacity more understanding than fancy she writes with sober energy and argumentative closeness  yet sympathy and benevolence give an interest to her sentiments and that vital heat to arguments which forces the reader to weigh them  Coinciding in opinion with Mrs Macaulay relative to many branches of education I refer to her valuable work instead of quoting her sentiments to support my own    When I first thought of writing these strictures I anticipated Mrs Macaulay's approbation with a little of that sanguine ardour which it has been the business of my life to depress but soon heard with the sickly qualm of disappointed hope and the still seriousness of regretthat she was no more  SECT V  TAKING a view of the different works which have been written on education Lord Chesterfield's Letters must not be silently passed over Not that I mean to analyze his unmanly immoral system or even to cull any of the useful shrewd remarks which occur in his frivolous correspondence No I only mean to make a few reflections on the avowed tendency of themthe art of acquiring an early knowledge of the world An art I  will venture to assert that preys secretly like the worm in the bud on the expanding powers and turns to poison the generous juices which should mount with vigour in the youthful frame inspiring warm affections and great resolves  That children ought to be constantly guarded against the vices and follies of the world appears to me a very mistaken opinion for in the course of my experience and my eyes have looked abroad I never knew a youth educated in this manner who had early imbibed these chilling suspicions and repeated by rote the hesitating  if  of age that did not prove a selfish character    For every thing saith the wise man there is a seasonand who would look for the fruits of autumn during the genial months of spring But this is mere declamation and I mean to reason with those worldlywise instructors who instead of cultivating the judgment instil prejudices and render hard the heart that gradual experience would only have cooled An early acquaintance with human infirmities or what is termed knowledge of the world is the surest way in my opinion to contract the heart and damp the natural youthful ardour which produces not only great talents but great virtues For the vain attempt to bring forth the fruit of  experience before the sapling has thrown out its leaves only exhausts its strength and prevents its assuming a natural form just as the form and strength of subsiding metals are injured when the attraction of cohesion is disturbed  Tell me ye who have studied the human mind is it not a strange way to fix principles by showing young people that they are seldom stable And how can they be fortified by habits when they are proved to be fallacious by example Why is the ardour of youth thus to be damped and the luxuriancy of fancy cut to the quick This dry caution may it is true guard a character from worldly mischances but will infallibly preclude excellence in either virtue or knowledge  I have already observed that an early knowledge of the world obtained in a natural way by mixing in the world has the same effect instancing officers and women  The stumblingblock thrown across every path by suspicion will prevent any vigorous exertions of genius or benevolence and life will be stripped of its most alluring charm long before its calm evening when man should retire to contemplation for comfort and support  A young man who has been bred up with domestic friends and led to store his mind  with as much speculative knowledge as can be acquired by reading and the natural reflections which youthful ebullitions of animal spirits and instinctive feelings inspire will enter the world with warm and erroneous expectations But this appears to be the course of nature and in morals as well as in works of taste we should be observant of her sacred indications and not presume to lead when we ought obsequiously to follow  In the world few people act from principle present feelings and early habits are the grand springs but how would the former be deadened and the latter rendered iron corroding fetters if the world were shewn to young people just as it is when no knowledge of mankind or their own hearts slowly obtained by experience rendered them forbearing Their fellow creatures would not then be viewed as frail beings like themselves condemned to struggle with human infirmities and sometimes displaying the light and sometimes the dark side of their character extorting alternate feelings of love and disgust but guarded against as beasts of prey till every enlarged social feeling in a word humanity was eradicated  In life on the contrary as we gradually discover the imperfections of our nature we discover virtues and various circumstances attach us to our fellow creatures when we mix with them and view the same objects that are never thought of in acquiring a hasty unnatural knowledge of the world We see a folly swell into a vice by almost imperceptible degrees and pity while we blame but if the hideous monster burst suddenly on our sight fear and disgust rendering us more severe than man ought to be might lead us with blind zeal to usurp the character of omnipotence and denounce damnation on our fellow mortals forgetting that we cannot read the heart and that we have seeds of the same vices lurking in our own  I have already remarked that we expect more from instruction than more instruction can produce for instead of preparing young people to encounter the evils of life with dignity and to acquire wisdom and virtue by the exercise of their own faculties precepts are heaped upon precepts and blind obedience required when conviction should be brought home to reason  Suppose for instance that a young person in the first ardour of friendship deifies the beloved objectwhat harm can arise from this mistaken enthusiastic attachment Perhaps it is necessary for virtue first to appear in a human form to impress youthful hearts the ideal model which a more matured and exalted mind looks up to and shapes for itself would elude their sight He who loves not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God asked the wisest of men  It is natural for youth to adorn the first object of its affection with every good quality and the emulation produced by ignorance or to speak with more propriety by inexperience brings forward the mind capable of forming such an affection and when in the lapse of time perfection is found not to be within the reach of mortals virtue abstractedly is thought beautiful and wisdom sublime Admiration then gives place to friendship properly so called because it is cemented by esteem and the being walks alone only dependent on heaven for that emulous panting after perfection which ever glows in a noble mind But this knowledge a man must gain by the exertion of his own  faculties and this is surely the blessed fruit of disappointed hope for He who delighteth to diffuse happiness and shew mercy to the weak creatures who are learning to know him never implanted a good propensity to be a tormenting ignis fatuus  Our trees are now allowed to spread with wild luxuriance nor do we expect by force to combine the majestic marks of time with youthful graces but wait patiently till they have struck deep their root and braved many a stormIs the mind then which in proportion to its dignity advances more slowly towards perfection to be treated with less respect To argue from analogy every thing around us is in a progressive state and when an unwelcome knowledge of life produces almost a satiety of life and we discover by the natural course of things that all that is done under the sun is vanity we are drawing near the awful close of the drama The days of activity and hope are over and the opportunities which the first stage of existence has afforded of advancing in the scale of intelligence must soon be summed upA knowledge at this period of the futility of life or earlier if obtained by experience is very  useful because it is natural but when a frail being is shewn the follies and vices of man that he may be taught prudently to guard against the common casualties of life by sacrificing his heartsurely it is not speaking harshly to call it the wisdom of this world contrasted with the nobler fruit of piety and experience  I will venture a paradox and deliver my opinion without reserve if men were only born to form a circle of life and death it would be wise to take every step that foresight could suggest to render life happy Moderation in every pursuit would then be supreme wisdom and the prudent voluptuary might enjoy a degree of content though he neither cultivated his understanding nor kept his heart pure Prudence supposing we were mortal would be true wisdom or to be more explicit would procure the greatest portion of happiness considering the whole of life but knowledge beyond the conveniences of life would be a curse  Why should we injure our health by close study The exalted pleasure which intellectual pursuits afford would scarcely be equivalent to the hours of languor that follow especially if it be necessary to take into the  reckoning the doubts and disappointments that cloud our researches Vanity and vexation close every inquiry for the cause which we particularly wished to discover flies like the horizon before us as we advance The ignorant on the contrary resemble children and suppose that if they could walk straight forward they should at last arrive where the earth and clouds meet Yet disappointed as we are in our researches the mind gains strength by the exercise sufficient perhaps to comprehend the answers which in another step of existence it may receive to the anxious questions it asked when the understanding with feeble wing was fluttering round the visible effects to dive into the hidden cause  The passions also the winds of life would be useless if not injurious did the substance which composes our thinking being after we have thought in vain only become the support of vegetable life and invigorate a cabbage or blush in a rose The appetites would answer every earthly purpose and produce more moderate and permanent happiness But the powers of the soul that are of little use here and probably disturb our animal enjoyments even while conscious dignity  makes us glory in possessing them prove that life is merely an education a state of infancy to which the only hopes worth cherishing should not be sacrificed I mean therefore to infer that we ought to have a precise idea of what we wish to attain by education for the immortality of the soul is contradicted by the actions of many people who firmly profess the belief  If you mean to secure ease and prosperity on earth as the first consideration and leave futurity to provide for itself you act prudently in giving your child an early insight into the weaknesses of his nature You may not it is true make an Inkle of him but do not imagine that he will stick to more than the letter of the law who has very early imbibed a mean opinion of human nature nor will he think it necessary to rise much above the common standard He may avoid gross vices because honesty is the best policy but he will never aim at attaining great virtues The example of writers and artists will illustrate this remark  I must therefore venture to doubt whether what has been thought an axiom in morals may not have been a dogmatical assertion  made by men who have coolly seen mankind through the medium of books and say in direct contradiction to them that the regulation of the passions is not always wisdom On the contrary it should seem that one reason why men have superiour judgment and more fortitude than women is undoubtedly this that they give a freer scope to the grand passions and by more frequently going astray enlarge their minds If then by the exercise of their own  'I find that all is but lipwisdom which wants experience' says Sidney  reason they fix on some stable principle they have probably to thank the force of their passions nourished by  false  views of life and permitted to overleap the boundary that secures content But if in the dawn of life we could soberly survey the scenes before as in perspective and see every thing in its true colours how could the passions gain sufficient strength to unfold the faculties  Let me now as from an eminence survey the world stripped of all its false delusive charms The clear atmosphere enables me to see each object in its true point of view while my heart is still I am calm as the  prospect in a morning when the mists slowly dispersing silently unveil the beauties of nature refreshed by rest  In what light will the world now appear I rub my eyes and think perchance that I am just awaking from a lively dream  I see the sons and daughters of men pursuing shadows and anxiously wasting their powers to feed passions which have no adequate objectif the very excess of these blind impulses pampered by that lying yet constantly trusted guide the imagination did not by preparing them for some other state render shortsighted mortals wiser without their own concurrence or what comes to the same thing when they were pursuing some imaginary present good  After viewing objects in this light it would not be very fanciful to imagine that this world was a stage on which a pantomime is daily performed for the amusement of superiour beings How would they be diverted to see the ambitious man consuming himself by running after a phantom and  pursuing the bubble fame in the cannon's mouth  that was to blow him to nothing for when consciousness is lost it matters not whether we  mount in a whirlwind or descend in rain And should they compassionately invigorate his sight and shew him the thorny path which led to eminence that like a quicksand sinks as he ascends disappointing his hopes when almost within his grasp would he not leave to others the honour of amusing them and labour to secure the present moment though from the constitution of his nature he would not find it very easy to catch the flying stream Such slaves are we to hope and fear  But vain as the ambitious man's pursuits would be he is often striving for something more substantial than famethat indeed would be the veriest meteor the wildest fire that could lure a man to ruinWhat renounce the most trifling gratification to be applauded when he should be no more Wherefore this struggle whether man is mortal or immortal if that noble passion did not really raise the being above his fellows  And love What diverting scenes would it producePantaloon's tricks must yield to more egregious folly To see a mortal adorn an object with imaginary charms and then fall down and worship the idol which he had himself set uphow ridiculous But what  serious consequences ensue to rob man of that portion of happiness which the Deity by calling him into existence has or on what can his attributes rest indubitably promised would not all the purposes of life have been much better fulfilled if he had only felt what has been termed physical love And would not the sight of the object not seen through the medium of the imagination soon reduce the passion to an appetite if reflection the noble distinction of man did not give it force and make it an instrument to raise him above this earthy dross by teaching him to love the centre of all perfection whose wisdom appears clearer and clearer in the works of nature in proportion as reason is illuminated and exalted by contemplation and by acquiring that love of order which the struggles of passion produce  The habit of reflection and the knowledge attained by fostering any passion might be shewn to be equally useful though the object be proved equally fallacious for they would all appear in the same light if they were not magnified by the governing passion implanted in us by the Author of all good  to call forth and strengthen the faculties of each individual and enable it to attain all the experience that an infant can obtain who does certain things it cannot tell why  I descend from my height and mixing with my fellowcreatures feel myself hurried along the common stream ambition love hope and fear exert their wonted power though we be convinced by reason that their present and most attractive promises are only lying dreams but had the cold hand of circumspection damped each generous feeling before it had left any permanent character or fixed some habit what could be expected but selfish prudence and reason just rising above instinct Who that has read Dean Swift's disgusting description of the Yahoos and insipid one of Houyhnhnm with a philosophical eye can avoid seeing the futility of degrading the passions or making man rest in contentment  The youth should  act  for had he the experience of a grey head he would be fitter for death than life though his virtues rather residing in his head than his heart could produce nothing great and his understanding  prepared for this world would not by its noble flights prove that it had a title to a better  Besides it is not possible to give a young person a just view of life he must have struggled with his own passions before he can estimate the force of the temptation which betrayed his brother into vice Those who are entering life and those who are departing see the world from such very different points of view that they can seldom think alike unless the unfledged reason of the former never attempted a solitary flight  When we hear of some daring crimeit comes full on us in the deepest shade of turpitude and raises indignation but the eye that gradually saw the darkness thicken must observe it with more compassionate forbearance The world cannot be seen by an unmoved spectator we must mix in the throng and feel as men feel before we can judge of their feelings If we mean in short to live in the world to grow wiser and better and not merely to enjoy the good things of life we must attain a knowledge of others at the same time that we become acquainted with ourselvesknowledge acquired any other way  only hardens the heart and perplexes the understanding  I may be told that the knowledge thus acquired is sometimes purchased at too dear a rate I can only answer that I very much doubt whether any knowledge can be attained without labour and sorrow and those who wish to spare their children both should not complain if they are neither wise nor virtuous They only aimed at making them prudent and prudence early in life is but the cautious craft of ignorant selflove  I have observed that young people to whose education particular attention has been paid have in general been very superficial and conceited and far from pleasing in any respect because they had neither the unsuspecting warmth of youth nor the cool depth of age I cannot help imputing this unnatural appearance principally to that hasty premature instruction which leads them presumptuously to repeat all the crude notions they have taken upon trust so that the careful education which they received makes them all their lives the slaves of prejudices  Mental as well as bodily exertion is at first irksome so much so that the many  would fain let others both work and think for them An observation which I have often made will illustrate my meaning When in a circle of strangers or acquaintances a person of moderate abilities asserts an opinion with heat I will venture to affirm for I have traced this fact home very often that it is a prejudice These echoes have a high respect for the understanding of some relation or friend and without fully comprehending the opinions which they are so eager to retail they maintain them with a degree of obstinacy that would surprise even the person who concocted them  I know that a kind of fashion now prevails of respecting prejudices and when any one dares to face them though actuated by humanity and armed by reason he is superciliously asked whether his ancestors were fools No I should reply opinions at first of every description were all probably considered and therefore were founded on some reason yet not unfrequently of course it was rather a local expedient than a fundamental principle that would be reasonable at all times But mosscovered opinions assume the disproportioned form of prejudices when  they are indolently adopted only because age has given them a venerable aspect though the reason on which they were built ceases to be a reason or cannot be traced Why are we to love prejudices merely because they are prejudices  Vide Mr Burke  A prejudice is a fond obstinate persuasion for which we can give no reason for the moment a reason can be given for an opinion it ceases to be a prejudice though it may be an error in judgment and are we then advised to cherish opinions only to set reason at defiance This mode of arguing if arguing it may be called reminds me of what is vulgarly termed a woman's reason For women sometimes declare that they love or believe certain things  because  they love or believe them  It is impossible to converse with people to any purpose who in this style only use affirmatives and negatives Before you can bring them to a point to start fairly from you must go back to the simple principles that were antecedent to the prejudices broached by power and it is ten to one butyou are stopped by the philosophical assertion that certain principles are as practically false as  they are abstractly true  'Convince a man against his will  'And he's of the same opinion still'  Nay it may be inferred that reason has whispered some doubts for it generally happens that people assert their opinions with the greatest heat when they begin to waver striving to drive out their own doubts by convincing their opponent they grow angry when those gnawing doubts are thrown back to prey on themselves  The fact is that men expect from education what education cannot give A sagacious parent or tutor may strengthen the body and sharpen the instruments by which the child is to gather knowledge but the honey must be the reward of the individual's own industry It is almost as absurd to attempt to make a youth wise by the experience of another as to expect the body to grow strong by the exercise which is only talked of or seen  One sees nothing when one is content to contemplate only it is necessary to act oneself to be able to see how others act  Rousseau  Many of those children whose conduct has been most narrowly watched become the weakest men because  their instructors only instil certain notions into their minds that have no other foundation than their authority and if they are loved or respected the mind is cramped in its exertions and wavering in its advances The business of education in this case is only to conduct the shooting tendrils to a proper pole yet after laying precept upon precept without allowing a child to acquire judgment itself parents expect them to act in the same manner by this borrowed fallacious light as if they had illuminated it themselves and be when they enter life what their parents are at the close They do not consider that the tree and even the human body does not strengthen its fibres till it has reached its full growth  There appears to be something analogous in the mind The senses and the imagination give a form to the character during childhood and youth and the understanding as life advances gives firmness to the first fair purposes of sensibilitytill virtue arising rather from the clear conviction of reason than the impulse of the heart morality is made to rest on a rock against which the storms of passion vainly beat  I hope I shall not be misunderstood when I say that religion will not have this condensing energy unless it be founded on reason If it be merely the refuge of weakness or wild fanaticism and not a governing principle of conduct drawn from selfknowledge and a rational opinion respecting the attributes of God what can it be expected to produce The religion which consists in warming the affections and exalting the imagination is only the poetical part and may afford the individual pleasure without rendering it a more moral being It may be a substitute for worldly pursuits yet narrow instead of enlarging the heart but virtue must be loved as in itself sublime and excellent and not for the advantages it procures or the evils it averts if any great degree of excellence be expected Men will not become moral when they only build airy castles in a future world to compensate for the disappointments which they meet with in this if they turn their thoughts from relative duties to religious reveries  Most prospects in life are marred by the shuffling worldly wisdom of men who forgetting that they cannot serve God and mammon endeavour to blend contradictory  thingsIf you wish to make your son rich pursue one courseif you are only anxious to make him virtuous you must take another but do not imagine that you can bound from one road to the other without losing your way  See an excellent essay on this subject by Mrs Barbauld in  Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose      CHAP VI THE EFFECT WHICH AN EARLY ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS HAS UPON THE CHARACTER  EDUCATED in the enervating style recommended by the writers on whom I have been animadverting and not having a chance from their subordinate state in society to recover their lost ground is it surprising that women every where appear a defect in nature Is it surprising when we consider what a determinate effect an early association of ideas has on the character that they neglect their understandings and turn all their attention to their persons  The great advantages which naturally result from storing the mind with knowledge are obvious from the following considerations The association of our ideas is either habitual or instantaneous and the latter mode seems rather to depend on the original temperature of the mind than on the will When the  ideas and matters of fact are once taken in they lie by for use till some fortuitous circumstance makes the information dart into the mind with illustrative force that has been received at very different periods of our lives Like the lightning's flash are many recollections one idea assimilating and explaining another with astonishing rapidity I do not now allude to that quick perception of truth which is so intuitive that it baffles research and makes us at a loss to determine whether it is reminiscence or ratiocination lost sight of in its celerity that opens the dark cloud Over those instantaneous associations we have little power for when the mind is once enlarged by excursive flights or profound reflection the raw materials will in some degree arrange themselves The understanding it is true may keep us from going out of drawing when we group our thoughts or transcribe from the imagination the warm sketches of fancy but the animal spirits the individual character give the colouring Over this subtile electric fluid  I have sometimes when inclined to laugh at materialists asked whether as the most powerful effects in nature are apparently produced by fluids the magnetic c the passions might not be fine volatile fluids that embraced humanity keeping the more refractory elementary parts togetheror whether they were simply a liquid fire that pervaded the more sluggish materials giving them life and heat  how little  power do we possess and over it how little power can reason obtain These fine intractable spirits appear to be the essence of genius and beaming in its eagle eye produce in the most eminent degree the happy energy of associating thoughts that surprise delight and instruct These are the glowing minds that concentrate pictures for their fellowcreatures forcing them to view with interest the objects reflected from the impassioned imagination which they passed over in nature  I must be allowed to explain myself The generality of people cannot see or feel poetically they want fancy and therefore fly from solitude in search of sensible objects but when an author lends them his eyes they can see as he saw and be amused by images they could not select though lying before them  Education thus only supplies the man of genius with knowledge to give variety and  contrast to his associations but there is an habitual association of ideas that grows  with our growth  which has a great effect on the moral character of mankind and by which a turn is given to the mind that commonly remains throughout life So ductile is the understanding and yet so stubborn that the associations which depend on adventitious circumstances during the period that the body takes to arrive at maturity can seldom be disentangled by reason One idea calls up another its old associate and memory faithful to the first impressions particularly when the intellectual powers are not employed to cool our sensations retraces them with mechanical exactness  This habitual slavery to first impressions has a more baneful effect on the female than the male character because business and other dry employments of the understanding tend to deaden the feelings and break associations that do violence to reason But females who are made women of when they are mere children and brought back to childhood when they ought to leave the gocart for ever have not sufficient strength of mind to efface  the superinductions of art that have smothered nature  Every thing that they see or hear serves to fix impressions call forth emotions and associate ideas that give a sexual character to the mind False notions of beauty and delicacy stop the growth of their limbs and produce a sickly soreness rather than delicacy of organs and thus weakened by being employed in unfolding instead of examining the first associations forced on them by every surrounding object how can they attain the vigour necessary to enable them to throw off their factitious characterwhere find strength to recur to reason and rise superiour to a system of oppression that blasts the fair promises of spring This cruel association of ideas which every thing conspires to twist into all their habits of thinking or to speak with more precision of feeling receives new force when they begin to act a little for themselves for they then perceive that it is only through their address to excite emotions in men that pleasure and power are to be obtained Besides all the books professedly written for their instruction which make the first impression on their minds all inculcate the same  opinions Educated then in worse than Egyptian bondage it is unreasonable as well as cruel to upbraid them with faults that can scarcely be avoided unless a degree of native vigour be supposed that falls to the lot of very few amongst mankind  For instance the severest sarcasms have been levelled against the sex and they have been ridiculed for repeating 'a set of phrases learnt by rote' when nothing could be more natural considering the education they receive and that their  highest praise is to obey unargued  the will of man If they are not allowed to have reason sufficient to govern their own conductwhy all they learnmust be learned by rote And when all their ingenuity is called forth to adjust their dress 'a passion for a scarlet coat' is so natural that it never surprised me and allowing Pope's summary of their character to be just  that every woman is at heart a rake  why should they be bitterly censured for seeking a congenial mind and preferring a rake to a man of sense  Rakes know how to work on their sensibility whilst the modest merit of reasonable men has of course less effect on their feelings  and they cannot reach the heart by the way of the understanding because they have few sentiments in common  It seems a little absurd to expect women to be more reasonable than men in their  likings  and still to deny them the uncontrouled use of reason When do men  fallinlove  with sense When do they with their superiour powers and advantages turn from the person to the mind And how can they then expect women who are only taught to observe behaviour and acquire manners rather than morals to despise what they have been all their lives labouring to attain Where are they suddenly to find judgment enough to weigh patiently the sense of an awkward virtuous man when his manners of which they are made critical judges are rebuffing and his conversation cold and dull because it does not consist of pretty repartees or well turned compliments In order to admire or esteem any thing for a continuance we must at least have our curiosity excited by knowing in some degree what we admire for we are unable to estimate the value of qualities and virtues above our comprehension Such a respect when it is felt may be very  sublime and the confused consciousness of humility may render the dependent creature an interesting object in some points of view but human love must have grosser ingredients and the person very naturally will come in for its shareand an ample share it mostly has  Love is in a great degree an arbitrary passion and will reign like some other stalking mischiefs by its own authority without deigning to reason and it may also be easily distinguished from esteem the foundation of friendship because it is often excited by evanescent beauties and graces though to give an energy to the sentiment something more solid must deepen their impression and set the imagination to work to make the most fairthe first good  Common passions are excited by common qualitiesMen look for beauty and the simper of goodhumoured docility women are captivated by easy manners a gentlemanlike man seldom fails to please them and their thirsty ears eagerly drink the insinuating nothings of politeness whilst they turn from the unintelligible sounds of the charmerreason charm he never so wisely With respect  to superficial accomplishments the rake certainly has the advantage and of these females can form an opinion for it is their own ground Rendered gay and giddy by the whole tenor of their lives the very aspect of wisdom or the severe graces of virtue must have a lugubrious appearance to them and produce a kind of restraint from which they and love sportive child naturally revolt Without taste excepting of the lighter kind for taste is the offspring of judgment how can they discover that true beauty and grace must arise from the play of the mind and how can they be expected to relish in a lover what they do not or very imperfectly possess themselves The sympathy that unites hearts and invites to confidence in them is so very faint that it cannot take fire and thus mount to passion No I repeat it the love cherished by such minds must have grosser fewel  The inference is obvious till women are led to exercise their understandings they should not be satirized for their attachment to rakes nor even for being rakes at heart when it appears to be the inevitable consequence of their education They who live  to pleasemust find their enjoyments their happiness in pleasure It is a trite yet true remark that we never do any thing well unless we love it for its own sake  Supposing however for a moment that women were in some future revolution of time to become what I sincerely wish them to be even love would acquire more serious dignity and be purified in its own fires and virtue giving true delicacy to their affections they would turn with disgust from a rake Reasoning then as well as feeling the only province of woman at present they might easily guard against exteriour graces and quickly learn to despise the sensibility that had been excited and hackneyed in the ways of women whose trade was vice and allurements wanton airs They would recollect that the flame one must use appropriated expressions which they wished to light up had been exhausted by lust and that the sated appetite losing all relish for pure and simple pleasures could only be roused by licentious arts or variety What satisfaction could a woman of delicacy promise herself in a union with such a man when the very artlessness of her affection  might appear insipid Thus does Dryden describe the situation  'Where love is duty on the female side  'On theirs mere sensual gust and sought with surly pride'  But one grand truth women have yet to learn though much it imports them to act accordingly In the choice of a husband they should not be led astray by the qualities of a loverfor a lover the husband even supposing him to be wise and virtuous cannot long remain  Were women more rationally educated could they take a more comprehensive view of things they would be contented to love but once in their lives and after marriage calmly let passion subside into friendshipinto that tender intimacy which is the best refuge from care yet is built on such pure still affections that idle jealousies would not be allowed to disturb the discharge of the sober duties of life nor to engross the thoughts that ought to be otherwise employed This is a state in which many men live but few very few women And the difference may easily be accounted for without recurring to a sexual character Men for whom we are told women  were made have too much occupied the thoughts of women and this association has so entangled love with all their motives of action and to harp a little on an old string having been solely employed either to prepare themselves to excite love or actually putting their lessons in practice they cannot live without love But when a sense of duty or fear of shame obliges them to restrain this pampered desire of pleasing beyond certain lengths too far for delicacy it is true though far from criminality they obstinately determine to love I speak of the passion their husbands to the end of the chapterand then acting the part which they foolishly exacted from their lovers they become abject woers and fond slaves  Men of wit and fancy are often rakes and fancy is the food of love Such men will inspire passion Half the sex in its present infantine state would pine for a Lovelace a man so witty so graceful and so valiant and can they  deserve  blame for acting according to principles so constantly inculcated They want a lover and protector and behold him kneeling before thembravery prostrate to beauty The virtues of a husband  are thus thrown by love into the back ground and gay hopes or lively emotions banish reflection till the day of reckoning comes and come it surely will to turn the sprightly lover into a surly suspicious tyrant who contemptuously insults the very weakness he fostered Or supposing the rake reformed he cannot quickly get rid of old habits When a man of abilities is first carried away by his passions it is necessary that sentiment and taste varnish the enormities of vice and give a zest to brutal indulgences but when the gloss of novelty is worn off and pleasure palls upon the sense lasciviousness becomes barefaced and enjoyment only the desperate effort of weakness flying from reflexion as from a legion of devils Oh virtue thou art not an empty name All that life can givethou givest  If much comfort cannot be expected from the friendship of a reformed rake of superiour abilities what is the consequence when he lacketh sense as well as principles Verily misery in its most hideous shape When the habits of weak people are consolidated by time a reformation is barely possible and actually makes the beings miserable who have  not sufficient mind to be amused by innocent pleasure like the tradesman who retires from the hurry of business nature presents to them only a universal blank and the restless thoughts prey on the damped spirits  I have frequently seen this exemplified in women whose beauty could no longer be repaired They have retired from the noisy scenes of dissipation but unless they became methodists the solitude of the select society of their family connexions or acquaintance has presented only a fearful void consequently nervous complaints and all the vapourish train of idleness rendered them quite as useless and far more unhappy than when they joined the giddy throng  Their reformation as well as his retirement actually makes them wretched because it deprives them of all employment by quenching the hopes and fears that set in motion their sluggish minds  If such is the force of habit if such is the bondage of folly how carefully ought we to guard the mind from storing up vicious associations and equally careful should we be to cultivate the understanding to save the poor wight from the weak dependent state of even harmless ignorance For it is the right use of reason alone which makes us independent of every thingexcepting the unclouded Reason 'Whose service is perfect freedom'  CHAP VII MODESTYCOMPREHENSIVELY CONSIDERED AND NOT AS A SEXUAL VIRTUE  MODESTY Sacred offspring of sensibility and reasontrue delicacy of mindmay I unblamed presume to investigate thy nature and trace to its covert the mild charm that mellowing each harsh feature of a character renders what would otherwise only inspire cold admirationlovelyThou that smoothest the wrinkles of wisdom and softenest the tone of the sublimest virtues till they all melt into humanitythou that spreadest the ethereal cloud that surrounding love heightens every beauty it half shades breathing those coy sweets that steal into the heart and charm the sensesmodulate for me the language of persuasive reason till I rouse my sex from the flowery bed on which they supinely sleep life away  In speaking of the association of our ideas I have noticed two distinct modes and in  defining modesty it appears to me equally proper to discriminate that purity of mind which is the effect of chastity from a simplicity of character that leads us to form a just opinion of ourselves equally distant from vanity or presumption though by no means incompatible with a lofty consciousness of our own dignity Modesty in the latter signification of the term is that soberness of mind which teaches a man not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think and should be distinguished from humility because humility is a kind of selfabasement  A modest man often conceives a great plan and tenaciously adheres to it conscious of his own strength till success gives it a sanction that determines its character Milton was not arrogant when he suffered a suggestion of judgment to escape him that proved a prophesy nor was General Washington when he accepted of the command of the American forces The latter has always been characterized as a modest man but had he been merely humble he would probably have shrunk back irresolute afraid of trusting to himself the direction of an enterprise on which so much depended  A modest man is steady an humble man timid and a vain one presumptuousthis is the judgment which the observation of many characters has led me to form Jesus Christ was modest Moses was humble and Peter vain  Thus discriminating modesty from humility in one case I do not mean to confound it with bashfulness in the other Bashfulness in fact is so distinct from modesty that the most bashful lass or raw country lout often becomes the most impudent for their bashfulness being merely the instinctive timidity of ignorance custom soon changes it into assurance  'Such is the countrymaiden's fright  'When first a redcoat is in sight  'Behind the door she hides her face  'Next time at distance eyes the lace  'She now can all his terrors stand  'Nor from his squeeze withdraws her hand  'She plays familiar in his arms  'And ev'ry soldier hath his charms  'From tent to tent she spreads her flame  'For custom conquers fear and shame'  Gay    The shameless behaviour of the prostitutes who infest the streets of this metropolis raising  alternate emotions of pity and disgust may serve to illustrate this remark They trample on virgin bashfulness with a sort of bravado and glorying in their shame become more audaciously lewd than men however depraved to whom this sexual quality has not been gratuitously granted ever appear to be But these poor ignorant wretches never had any modesty to lose when they consigned themselves to infamy for modesty is a virtue not a quality No they were only bashful shamefaced innocents and losing their innocence their shamefacedness was rudely brushed off a virtue would have left some vestiges in the mind had it been sacrificed to passion to make us respect the grand ruin  Purity of mind or that genuine delicacy which is the only virtuous support of chastity is near akin to that refinement of humanity which never resides in any but cultivated minds It is something nobler than innocence it is the delicacy of reflection and not the coyness of ignorance The reserve of reason which like habitual cleanliness is seldom seen in any great degree unless the soul is active may easily be distinguished from rustic shyness or wanton skittishness and so  far from being incompatible with knowledge it is its fairest fruit What a gross idea of modesty had the writer of the following remark  The lady who asked the question whether women may be instructed in the modern system of botany consistently with female delicacywas accused of ridiculous prudery nevertheless if she had proposed the question to me I should certainly have answeredThey cannot  Thus is the fair book of knowledge to be shut with an everlasting seal On reading similar passages I have reverentially lifted up my eyes and heart to Him who liveth for ever and ever and said O my Father hast Thou by the very constitution of her nature forbid Thy child to seek Thee in the fair forms of truth And can her soul be sullied by the knowledge that awfully calls her to Thee  I have then philosophically pursued these reflections till I inferred that those women who have most improved their reason must have the most modestythough a dignified sedateness of deportment may have succeeded the playful bewitching bashfulness of youth  Modesty is the graceful calm virtue of maturity bashfulness the charm of vivacious youth    And thus have I argued To render chastity the virtue from which unsophisticated modesty will naturally flow the attention should be called away from employments which only exercise the sensibility and the heart made to beat time to humanity rather than to throb with love The woman who has dedicated a considerable portion of her time to pursuits purely intellectual and whose affections have been exercised by humane plans of usefulness must have more purity of mind as a natural consequence than the ignorant beings whose time and thoughts have been occupied by gay pleasures or schemes to conquer hearts  I have conversed as man with man with medical men on anatomical subjects and compared the proportions of the human body with artistsyet such modesty did I meet with that I was never reminded by word or look of my sex of the absurd rules which make modesty a pharisaical cloak of weakness And I am persuaded that in the pursuit of knowledge women would never be insulted by sensible men and rarely by men of any description if they did not by mock modesty remind them that they were women actuated by the same spirit as the Portugueze ladies who would think their charms insulted if when left alone with a man he did not at least attempt to be grossly familiar with their persons Men are not always men in the company of women nor would women always remember that they are women if they were allowed to acquire more understanding  The regulalation  of the behaviour is not modesty though those who study rules of decorum are in general termed modest women Make the heart clean let it expand and feel for all that is human instead of being narrowed by selfish passions and let the mind frequently contemplate subjects that exercise the understanding without heating the imagination and artless modesty will give the finishing touches to the picture  She who can discern the dawn of immortality in the streaks that shoot athwart the misty night of ignorance promising a clearer day will respect as a sacred temple the body that enshrines such an improvable soul True love likewise spreads this kind of mysterious sanctity round the beloved object making the lover most modest when in her presence  Male or female for the world contains many modest men  So reserved is affection that receiving or returning personal endearments it wishes not only to shun the human eye as a kind of profanation but to diffuse an  encircling cloudy obscurity to shut out even the saucy sparkling sunbeams Yet that affection does not deserve the epithet of chaste which does not receive a sublime gloom of tender melancholy that allows the mind for a moment to stand still and enjoy the present satisfaction when a consciousness of the Divine presence is feltfor this must ever be the food of joy  As I have always been fond of tracing to its source in nature any prevailing custom I have frequently thought that it was a sentiment of affection for whatever had touched the person of an absent or lost friend which gave birth to that respect for relicks so much abused by selfish priests Devotion or love may be allowed to hallow the garments as well as the person for the lover must want fancy who has not a sort of sacred respect for the glove or slipper of his mistress He could not confound them with vulgar things of the same kind This fine sentiment perhaps would not bear to be analyzed by the experimental philosopherbut of such stuff is human rapture made upA shadowy phantom glides before us obscuring every other object yet when the soft cloud is grasped  the form melts into common air leaving a solitary void or sweet perfume stolen from the violet that memory long holds dear But I have tripped unawares on fairy ground feeling the balmy gale of spring stealing on me though november frowns  As a sex women are more chaste than men and as modesty is the effect of chastity they may deserve to have this virtue ascribed to them in rather an appropriated sense yet I must be allowed to add an hesitating iffor I doubt whether chastity will produce modesty though it may propriety of conduct when it is merely a respect for the opinion of the world  The immodest behaviour of many married women who are nevertheless faithful to their husbands' beds will illustrate this remark  and when coquetry and the lovelorn tales of novelists employ the thoughts Nay from experience and reason I should be led to expect to meet with more modesty amongst men than women simply because men exercise their understandings more than women  But with respect to propriety of behaviour excepting one class of females women have evidently the advantage What can be  more disgusting than that impudent dross of gallantry thought so manly which makes many men stare insultingly at every female they meet Is this respect for the sex This loose behaviour shews such habitual depravity such weakness of mind that it is vain to expect much public or private virtue till both men and women grow more modest till men curbing a sensual fondness for the sex or an affectation of manly assurance more properly speaking impudence treat each other with respectunless appetite or passion gives the tone peculiar to it to their behaviour I mean even personal respect the modest respect of humanity and fellowfeelingnot the libidinous mockery of gallantry nor the insolent condescension of protectorship  To carry the observation still further modesty must heartily disclaim and refuse to dwell with that debauchery of mind which leads a man coolly to bring forward without a blush indecent allusions or obscene witticisms in the presence of a fellow creature women are now out of the question for then it is brutality Respect for man as man is the foundation of every noble sentiment How much more  modest is the libertine who obeys the call of appetite or fancy than the lewd joker who sets the table in a roar  This is one of the many instances in which the sexual distinction respecting modesty has proved fatal to virtue and happiness It is however carried still further and woman weak woman made by her education the slave of sensibility is required on the most trying occasions to resist that sensibility  Can any thing says Knox be more absurd than keeping women in a state of ignorance and yet so vehemently to insist on their resisting temptation  Thus when virtue or honour make it proper to check a passion the burden is thrown on the weaker shoulders contrary to reason and true modesty which at least should render the selfdenial mutual to say nothing of the generosity of bravery supposed to be a manly virtue  In the same strain runs Rousseau's and Dr Gregory's advice respecting modesty strangely miscalled for they both desire a wife to leave it in doubt whether sensibility or weakness led her to her husband's arms The woman is immodest who can let the  shadow of such a doubt remain on her husband's mind a moment  But to state the subject in a different light The want of modesty which I principally deplore as subversive of morality arises from the state of warfare so strenuously supported by voluptuous men as the very essence of modesty though in fact its bane because it is a refinement on lust that men fall into who have not sufficient virtue to relish the innocent pleasures of love A man of delicacy carries his notions of modesty still further for neither weakness nor sensibility will gratify himhe looks for affection  Again men boast of their triumphs over women what do they boast of Truly the creature of sensibility was surprised by her sensibility into follyinto vice  The poor moth fluttering round a candle burns its wings  and the dreadful reckoning falls heavily on her own weak head when reason wakes For where art thou to find comfort forlorn and disconsolate one He who ought to have directed thy reason and supported thy weakness has betrayed thee In a dream of passion thou consentedst to wander through flowery lawns  and heedlessly stepping over the precipice to which thy guide instead of guarding lured thee thou startest from thy dream only to face a sneering frowning world and to find thyself alone in a waste for he that triumphed in thy weakness is now pursuing new conquests but for theethere is no redemption on this side the graveAnd what resource has thou in an enervated mind to raise a sinking heart  But if the sexes are really to live in a state of warfare if nature has pointed it out let men act nobly or let pride whisper to them that the victory is mean when they merely vanquish sensibility The real conquest is that over affection not taken by surprisewhen like Heloisa a woman gives up all the world deliberately for love I do not now consider the wisdom or virtue of such a sacrifice I only contend that it was a sacrifice to affection and not merely to sensibility though she had her shareAnd I must be allowed to call her a modest woman before I dismiss this part of the subject by saying that till men are more chaste women will be immodest Where indeed could modest women find husbands from whom they would  not continually turn with disgust Modesty must be equally cultivated by both sexes or it will ever remain a sickly hothouse plant whilst the affectation of it the fig leaf borrowed by wantonness may give a zest to voluptuous enjoyments  Men will probably still insist that woman ought to have more modesty than man but it is not dispassionate reasoners who will most earnestly oppose my opinion No they are the men of fancy the favourites of the sex who outwardly respect and inwardly despise the weak creatures whom they thus sport with They cannot submit to resign the highest sensual gratification nor even to relish the epicurism of virtueselfdenial  To take another view of the subject confining my remarks to women  The ridiculous falsities  Children very early see cats with their kittens birds with their young ones c Why then are they not to be told that their mothers carry and nourish them in the same way As there would then be no appearance of mystery they would never think of the subject more Truth may always be told to children if it be told gravely but it is the immodesty of affected modesty that does all the mischief and this smoke heats the imagination by vainly endeavouring to obscure certain objects If indeed children could be kept entirely from improper company we should never allude to any such subjects but as this is impossible it is best to tell them the truth especially as such information not interesting them will make no impression on their imagination  which are told to children from mistaken notions of modesty  tend very early to inflame their imaginations and set their little minds to work respecting subjects which nature never intended they should think of till the body arrived at some degree of maturity then the passions naturally begin to take place of the senses as instruments to unfold the understanding and form the moral character  In nurseries and boardingschools I fear girls are first spoiled particularly in the latter A number of girls sleep in the same room and wash together And though I should be sorry to contaminate an innocent creature's mind by instilling false delicacy or those indecent prudish notions which early cautions respecting the other sex naturally engender I should be very anxious to prevent their acquiring nasty or immodest habits and as many girls have learned very nasty tricks from ignorant servants the  mixing them thus indiscriminately together is very improper  To say the truth women are in general too familiar with each other which leads to that gross degree of familiarity that so frequently renders the marriage state unhappy Why in the name of decency are sisters female intimates or ladies and their waitingwomen to be so grossly familiar as to forget the respect which one human creature owes to another That squeamish delicacy which shrinks from the most disgusting offices when affection  Affection would rather make one choose to perform these offices to spare the delicacy of a friend by still keeping a veil over them for the personal helplessness produced by sickness is of an humbling nature  or humanity lead us to watch at a sick pillow is despicable But why women in health should be more familiar with each other than men are when they boast of their superiour delicacy is a solecism in manners which I could never solve  In order to preserve health and beauty I should earnestly recommend frequent ablutions to dignify my advice that it may not offend the fastidious ear and by example girls ought to be taught to wash and dress alone  without any distinction of rank and if custom should make them require some little assistance let them not require it till that part of the business is over which ought never to be done before a fellowcreature because it is an insult to the majesty of human nature Not on the score of modesty but dedency for the care which some modest women take making at the same time a display of that care not to let their legs be seen is as childish as immodest  I remember to have met with a sentence in a book of education that made me smile  It would be needless to caution you against putting your hand by chance under your neckhandkerchief for a modest woman never did so    I could proceed still further till I animadverted on some still more nasty customs which men never fall into Secrets are told where silence ought to reign and that regard to cleanliness which some religious sects have perhaps carried too far especially the Essenes amongst the Jews by making that an insult to God which is only an insult to humanity is violated in a beastly manner How can  delicate  women obtrude on notice that part of the animal oeconomy which is  so very disgusting And is it not very rational to conclude that the women who have not been taught to respect the human nature of their own sex in these particulars will not long respect the mere difference of sex in their husbands After their maidenish bashfulness is once lost I in fact have generally observed that women fall into old habits and treat their husbands as they did their sisters or female acquaintance  Besides women from necessity because their minds are not cultivated have recourse very often to what I familiarly term bodily wit and their intimacies are of the same kind In short with respect to both mind and body they are too intimate That decent personal reserve which is the foundation of dignity of character must be kept up between women or their minds will never gain strength or modesty  On this account also I object to many females being shut up together in nurseries schools or convents I cannot recollect without indignation the jokes and hoiden tricks which knots of young women indulge themselves in when in my youth accident threw me an awkward rustic in their way They  were almost on a par with the double meanings which shake the convivial table when the glass has circulated freely But it is vain to attempt to keep the heart pure unless the head is furnished with ideas and set to work to compare them in order to acquire judgment by generalizing simple ones and modesty by making the understanding damp the sensibility  It may be thought that I lay too great a stress on personal reserve but it is ever the handmaid of modesty So that were I to name the graces that ought to adorn beauty I should instantly exclaim cleanliness neatness and personal reserve It is obvious I suppose that the reserve I mean has nothing sexual in it and that I think it  equally  necessary in both sexes So necessary indeed is that reserve and cleanliness which indolent women too often neglect that I will venture to affirm that when two or three women live in the same house the one will be most respected by the male part of the family who reside with them leaving love entirely out of the question who pays this kind of habitual respect to her person  When domestic friends meet in a morning there will naturally prevail an affectionate seriousness especially if each look forward to the discharge of daily duties and it may be reckoned fanciful but this sentiment has frequently rose spontaneously in my mind I have been pleased after breathing the sweetbracing morning air to see the same kind of freshness in the countenances I particularly loved I was glad to see them braced as it were for the day and ready to run their course with the sun The greetings of affection in the morning are by these means more respectful than the familiar tenderness which frequently prolongs the evening talk Nay I have often felt hurt not to say disgusted when a friend has appeared whom I parted with full dressed the evening before with her clothes huddled on because she chose to indulge herself in bed till the last moment  Domestic affection can only be kept alive by these neglected attentions yet if men and women took half as much pains to dress habitually neat as they do to ornament or rather to disfigure their persons much would be done towards the attainment of purity of mind But women only dress to gratify men  of gallantry for the lover is always best pleased with the simple garb that sits close to the shape There is an impertinence in ornaments that rebuffs affection because love always clings round the idea of home  As a sex women are habitually indolent and every thing tends to make them so I do not forget the spurts of activity which sensibility produces but as these flights of feelings only increase the evil they are not to be confounded with the slow orderly walk of reason So great in reality is their mental and bodily indolence that till their body be strengthened and their understanding enlarged by active exertions there is little reason to expect that modesty will take place of bashfulness They may find it prudent to assume its semblance but the fair veil will only be worn on gala days  Perhaps there is not a virtue that mixes so kindly with every other as modesty It is the pale moonbeam that renders more interesting every virtue it softens giving mild grandeur to the contracted horizon Nothing can be more beautiful than the poetical fiction which makes Diana with her silver crescent the goddess of chastity  I have sometimes thought that wandering with sedate step in some lonely recess a modest dame of antiquity must have felt a glow of conscious dignity when after contemplating the soft shadowy landscape she has invited with placid fervour the mild reflection of her sisters beams to turn to her chaste bosom  A Christian has still nobler motives to incite her to preserve her chastity and acquire modesty for her body has been called the Temple of the living God of that God who requires more than modesty of mein His eye searcheth the heart and let her remember that if she hopeth to find favour in the sight of purity itself her chastity must be founded on modesty and not on worldly prudence or verily a good reputation will be her only reward for that awful intercourse that sacred communication which virtue establishes between man and his Maker must give rise to the wish of being pure as he is pure  After the foregoing remarks it is almost superfluous to add that I consider all those feminine airs of maturity which succeed bashfulness to which truth is sacrificed to secure the heart of a husband or rather to force him to be still a lover when nature  would had she not been interrupted in her operations have made love give place to friendship as immodest The tenderness which a man will feel for the mother of his children is an excellent substitute for the ardour of unsatisfied passion but to prolong that ardour it is indelicate not to say immodest for women to feign an unnatural coldness of constitution Women as well as men ought to have the common appetites and passions of their nature they are only brutal when unchecked by reason but the obligation to check them is the duty of mankind not a sexual duty Nature in these respects may safely be left to herself let women only acquire knowledge and humanity and love will teach them modesty  The behaviour of many newly married women has often disgusted me They seem anxious never to let their husbands forget the privilege of marriage and to find no pleasure in his society unless he is acting the lover Short indeed must be the reign of love when the flame is thus constantly blown up without its receiving any solid fewel  There is no need of falsehoods disgusting as futile for studied rules of behaviour only impose on shallow observers a man of sense soon sees through and despises the affectation  The behaviour of young people to each other as men and women is the last thing that should be thought of in education In fact behaviour in most circumstances is now so much thought of that simplicity of character is rarely to be seen yet if men were only anxious to cultivate each virtue and let it take root firmly in the mind the grace resulting from it its natural exteriour mark would soon strip affectation of its flaunting plumes because fallacious as unstable is the conduct that is not founded upon truth  Would ye O my sisters really possess modesty ye must remember that the possession of virtue of any denomination is incompatible with ignorance and vanity ye must acquire that soberness of mind which the exercise of duties and the pursuit of knowledge alone inspire or ye will still remain in a doubtful dependent situation and only be loved whilst ye are fair The downcast eye the rosy blush the retiring grace are all proper in their season but modesty being the child of reason cannot long exist with the sensibility that is not tempered by reflection Besides  when love even innocent love is the whole employ of your lives your hearts will be too soft to afford modesty that tranquil retreat where she delights to dwell in close union with humanity  CHAP VIII MORALITY UNDERMINED BY SEXUAL NOTIONS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD REPUTATION  IT has long since occurred to me that advice respecting behaviour and all the various modes of preserving a good reputation which have been so strenuously inculcated on the female world were specious poisons that incrusting morality eat away the substance And that this measuring of shadows produced a false calculation because their length depends so much on the height of the sun and other adventitious circumstances  From whence arises the easy fallacious behaviour of a courtier From his situation undoubtedly for standing in need of dependents he is obliged to learn the art of denying without giving offence and of evasively feeding hope with the chameleon's food thus does politeness sport with truth and  eating away the sincerity and humanity natural to man produce the fine gentleman  Women in the same way acquire from a supposed necessity an equally artificial mode of behaviour Yet truth is not with impunity to be sported with for the practised dissembler at last become the dupe of his own arts loses that sagacity which has been justly termed common sense namely a quick perception of common truths which are constantly received as such by the unsophisticated mind though it might not have had sufficient energy to discover them itself when obscured by local prejudices The greater number of people take their opinions on trust to avoid the trouble of exercising their own minds and these indolent beings naturally adhere to the letter rather than the spirit of a law divine or human  Women says some author I cannot recollect who mind not what only heaven sees  Why indeed should they it is the eye of man that they have been taught to dreadand if they can lull their Argus to sleep they seldom think of heaven or themselves because their repution is safe and it is reputation not chastity and all its fair train that they are employed  to keep free from spot not as a virtue but to preserve their station in the world  To prove the truth of this remark I need only advert to the intrigues of married women particularly in high life and in countries where women are suitably married according to their respective ranks by their parents If an innocent girl become a prey to love she is degraded for ever though her mind was not polluted by the arts which married women under the convenient cloke of marriage practise nor has she violated any dutybut the duty of respecting herself The married woman on the contrary breaks a most sacred engagement and becomes a cruel mother when she is a false and faithless wife If her husband has still an affection for her the arts which she must practise to deceive him will render her the most contemptible of human beings and at any rate the contrivances necessary to preserve appearances will keep her mind in that childish or vicious tumult which destroys all its energy Besides in time like those people who habitually take cordials to raise their spirits she will want an intrigue to give life to her thoughts having lost all relish for  pleasures that are not highly seasoned by hope or fear  Sometimes married women act still more audaciously I will mention an instance  A woman of quality notorious for her gallantries though as she still lived with her husband nobody chose to place her in the class where she ought to have been placed made a point of treating with the most insulting contempt a poor timid creature abashed by a sense of her former weakness whom a neighbouring gentleman had seduced and afterwards married This woman had actually confounded virtue with reputation and I do believe valued herself on the propriety of her behaviour before marriage though when once settled to the satisfaction of her family she and her lord were equally faithless so that the half alive heir to an immense estate came from heaven knows where  To view this subject in another light  I have known a number of women who if they did not love their husbands loved nobody else give themselves entirely up to vanity and dissipation neglecting every domestic duty nay even squandering away all the money which should have been saved  for their helpless younger children yet have plumed themselves on their unsullied reputation as if the whole compass of their duty as wives and mothers was only to preserve it Whilst other indolent women neglecting every personal duty have thought that they deserved their husbands' affection because they acted in this respect with propriety  Weak minds are always fond of resting in the ceremonials of duty but morality offers much simpler motives and it were to be wished that superficial moralists had said less respecting behaviour and outward observances for unless virtue of any kind is built on knowledge it will only produce a kind of insipid decency Respect for the opinion of the world has however been termed the principal duty of woman in the most express words for Rousseau declares  that reputation is no less indispensable than chastity A man adds he secure in his own good conduct depends only on himself and may brave the public opinion but a woman in behaving well performs but half her duty as what is thought of her is as important to her as what she really is It follows hence that the system of a woman's  education should in this respect be directly contrary to that of ours Opinion is the grave of virtue among the men but its throne among women  It is strictly logical to infer that the virtue that rests on opinion is merely worldly and that it is the virtue of a being to whom reason has been denied But even with respect to the opinion of the world I am convinced that this class of reasoners are mistaken  This regard for reputation independent of its being one of the natural rewards of virtue however took its rise from a cause that I have already deplored as the grand source of female depravity the impossibility of regaining respectability by a return to virtue though men preserve theirs during the indulgence of vice It was natural for women then to endeavour to preserve what once lostwas lost for ever till this care swallowing up every other care reputation for chastity became the one thing needful to the sex But vain is the scrupulosity of ignorance for neither religion nor virtue when they reside in the heart require such a puerile attention to mere ceremonies because the behaviour must upon  the whole be proper when the motive is pure  To support my opinion I can produce very respectable authority and the authority of a cool reasoner ought to have weight to enforce consideration though not to establish a sentiment Speaking of the general laws of morality Dr Smith observes  That by some very extraordinary and unlucky circumstance a good man may come to be suspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable and upon that account be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part of his life to the horror and aversion of mankind By an accident of this kind he may be said to lose his all notwithstanding his integrity and justice in the same manner as a cautious man notwithstanding his utmost circumspection may be ruined by an earthquake or an inundation Accidents of the first kind however are perhaps still more rare and still more contrary to the common course of things than those of the second and it still remains true that the practice of truth justice and humanity is a certain and almost infallible method of  acquiring what those virtues chiefly aim at the confidence and love of those we live with A person may be easily misrepresented with regard to a particular action but it is scarce possible that he should be so with regard to the general tenor of his conduct An innocent man may be believed to have done wrong this however will rarely happen On the contrary the established opinion of the innocence of his manners will often lead us to absolve him where he has really been in the fault notwithstanding very strong presumptions  I perfectly coincide in opinion with this writer for I verily believe that few of either sex were ever despised for certain vices without deserving to be despised I speak not of the calumny of the moment which hangs over a character like one of the dense fogs of November over this metropolis till it gradually subsides before the common light of day I only contend that the daily conduct of the majority prevails to stamp their character with the impression of truth Quietly does the clear light shining day after day refute the ignorant surmise or malicious tale which has thrown dirt on a pure character A false light distorted for a short time its shadow  reputation but it seldom fails to become just when the cloud is dispersed that produced the mistake in vision  Many people undoubtedly in several respects obtain a better reputation than strictly speaking they deserve for unremitting industry will mostly reach its goal in all races They who only strive for this paltry prize like the Pharisees who prayed at the corners of streets to be seen of men verily obtain the reward they seek for the heart of man cannot be read by man Still the fair fame that is naturally reflected by good actions when the man is only employed to direct his steps aright regardless of the lookerson is in general not only more true but more sure  There are it is true trials when the good man must appeal to God from the injustice of man and amidst the whining candour or hissings of envy erect a pavilion in his own mind to retire to till the rumour be overpast nay the darts of undeserved censure may pierce an innocent tender bosom through with many sorrows but these are all exceptions to general rules And it is according to these common laws that human behaviour ought to be regulated The eccentric orbit  of the comet never influences astronomical calculations respecting the invariable order established in the motion of the principal bodies of the solar system  I will then venture to affirm that after a man is arrived at maturity the general outline of his character in the world is just allowing for the beforementioned exceptions to the rule I do not say that a prudent worldlywise man with only negative virtues and qualities may not sometimes obtain a more smooth reputation than a wiser or a better man So far from it that I am apt to conclude from experience that where the virtue of two people is nearly equal the most negative character will be liked best by the world at large whilst the other may have more friends in private life But the hills and dales clouds and sunshine conspicuous in the virtues of great men set off each other and though they afford envious weakness a fairer mark to shoot at the real character will still work its way to light though bespattered by weak affection or ingenious malice  I allude to various biographical writings but particularly to Boswell's Life of Johnson    With respect to that anxiety to preserve a reputation hardly earned which leads sagacious people to analyze it I shall not make the obvious comment but I am afraid that morality is very insidiously undermined in the female world by the attention being turned to the shew instead of the substance A simple thing is thus made strangely complicated nay sometimes virtue and its shadow are set at variance We should never perhaps have heard of Lucretia had she died to preserve her chastity instead of her reputation If we really deserve our own good opinion we shall commonly be respected in the world but if we pant after higher improvement and higher attainments it is not sufficient to view ourselves as we suppose that we are viewed by others though this has been ingeniously argued as the foundation of our moral sentiments  Smith  Because each bystander may have his own prejudices beside the prejudices of his age or country We should rather endeavour to view ourselves as we suppose that Being views us who seeth each thought ripen into action and whose judgment never  swerves from the eternal rule of right Righteous are all his judgmentsjust as merciful  The humble mind that seeketh to find favour in His sight and calmly examines its conduct when only His presence is felt will seldom form a very erroneous opinion of its own virtues During the still hour of selfcollection the angry brow of offended justice will be fearfully deprecated or the tie which draws man to the Deity will be recognized in the pure sentiment of reverential adoration that swells the heart without exciting any tumultuous emotions In these solemn moments man discovers the germ of those vices which like the Java tree shed a pestiferous vapour arounddeath is in the shade and he perceives them without abhorrence because he feels himself drawn by some cord of love to all his fellowcreatures for whose follies he is anxious to find every extenuation in their naturein himself If I he may thus argue who exercise my own mind and have been refined by tribulation find the serpent's egg in some fold of my heart and crush it with difficulty shall not I pity those whose have stamped with less vigour or who have heedlessly nurtured the insidious reptile till it poisoned the vital stream it sucked Can I  conscious of my secret sins throw off my fellowcreatures and calmly see them drop into the chasm of perdition that yawns to receive themNo no The agonized heart will cry with suffocating impatienceI too am a man and have vices hid perhaps from human eye that bend me to the dust before God and loudly tell me when all is mute that we are formed of the same earth and breathe the same element Humanity thus rises naturally out of humility and twists the cords of love that in various convolutions entangle the heart  This sympathy extends still further till a man well pleased observes force in arguments that do not carry conviction to his own bosom and he gladly places in the fairest light to himself the shews of reason that have led others astray rejoiced to find some reason in all the errors of man though before convinced that he who rules the day makes his sun to shine on all Yet shaking hands thus as it were with corruption one foot on earth the other with bold stride mounts to heaven and claims kindred with superiour natures Virtues unobserved by man drop their balmy fragrance at this cool hour and the thirsty  land refreshed by the pure streams of comfort that suddenly gush out is crowned with smiling verdure this is the living green on which that eye may look with complacency that is too pure to behold iniquity  But my spirits flag and I must silently indulge the reverie these reflections lead to unable to describe the sentiments that have calmed my soul when watching the rising sun a soft shower drizzling through the leaves of neighbouring trees seemed to fall on my languid yet tranquil spirits to cool the heart that had been heated by the passions which reason laboured to tame  The leading principles which run through all my disquisitions would render it unnecessary to enlarge on this subject if a constant attention to keep the varnish of the character fresh and in good condition were not often inculcated as the sum total of female duty if rules to regulate the behaviour and to preserve the reputation did not too frequently supersede moral obligations But with respect to reputation the attention is confined to a single virtuechastity If the honour of a woman as it is absurdly called is safe she may neglect every social duty nay ruin  her family by gaming and extravagance yet still present a shameless frontfor truly she is an honourable woman  Mrs Macaulay has justly observed that  there is but one fault which a woman of honour may not commit with impunity  She then justly and humanely adds  This has given rise to the trite and foolish observation that the first fault against chastity in woman has a radical power to deprave the character But no such frail beings come out of the hands of nature The human mind is built of nobler materials than to be so easily corrupted and with all their disadvantages of situation and education women seldom become entirely abandoned till they are thrown into a state of desperation by the venomous rancour of their own sex  But in proportion as this regard for the reputation of chastity is prized by women it is despised by men and the two extremes are equally destructive to morality  Men are certainly more under the influence of their appetites than women and their appetites are more depraved by unbridled indulgence and the fastidious contrivances of  satiety Luxury has introduced a refinement in eating that destroys the constitution and a degree of gluttony which is so beastly that a perception of seemliness of behaviour must be worn out before one being could eat immoderately in the presence of another and afterwards complain of the oppression that his intemperance naturally produced Some women particularly French women have also lost a sense of decency in this respect for they will talk very calmly of an indigestion It were to be wished that idleness was not allowed to generate on the rank soil of wealth those swarms of summer insects that feed on putrefaction we should not then be disgusted by the sight of such brutal excesses  There is one rule relative to behaviour that I think ought to regulate every other and it is simply to cherish such an habitual respect for mankind as may prevent us from disgusting a fellowcreature for the sake of a present indulgence The shameful indolence of many married women and others a little advanced in life frequently leads them to sin against delicacy For though convinced that the person is the band of union between the sexes yet how often do they from sheer indolence  or to enjoy some trifling indulgence disgust  The depravity of the appetite which brings the sexes together has had a still more fatal effect Nature must ever be the standard of taste the gauge of appetiteyet how grossly is nature insulted by the voluptuary Leaving the refinements of love out of the question nature by making the gratification of an appetite in this respect as well as every other a natural and imperious law to preserve the species exalts the appetite and mixes a little mind and affection with a sensual gust The feelings of a parent mingling with an instinct merely animal give it dignity and the man and woman often meeting on account of the child a mutual interest and affection is excited by the exercise of a common sympathy Women then having necessarily some duty to fulfil more noble than to adorn their persons would not contentedly be the slaves of casual lust which is now the situation of a very considerable number who are literally speaking standing dishes to which every glutton may have access  I may be told that great as this enormity is it only affects a devoted part of the sexdevoted for the salvation of the rest But false as every assertion might easily be proved that recommends the sanctioning a small evil to produce a greater good the mischief does not stop here for the moral character and peace of mind of the chaster part of the sex is undermined by the conduct of the very women to whom they allow no refuge from guilt whom they inexorably consign to the exercise of arts that lure their husbands from them debauch their sons and force them let not modest women start to assume in some degree the same character themselves For I will venture to assert that all the causes of female weakness as well as depravity which I have already enlarged on branch out of one grand causewant of chastity in men  This intemperance so prevalent depraves the appetite to such a degree that a wanton stimulus is necessary to rouse it but the parental design of nature is forgotten and the mere person and that for a moment alone engrosses the thoughts So voluptuous indeed often grows the lustful prowler that he refines on female softness Something  more soft than woman is then sought for till in Italy and Portugal men attend the levees of equivocal beings to sigh for more than female languor  To satisfy this genus of men women are made systematically voluptuous and though they may not all carry their libertinism to the same height yet this heartless intercourse with the sex which they allow themselves depraves both sexes because the taste of men is vitiated and women of all classes naturally square their behaviour to gratify the taste by which they obtain pleasure and power Women becoming consequently weaker in mind and body than they ought to be were one of the grand ends of their being taken into the account that of bearing and nursing children have not sufficient strength to discharge the first duty of a mother and sacrificing to lasciviousness the parental affection that ennobles instinct either destroy the embryo in the womb or cast it off when born Nature in every thing demands respect and those who violate her laws seldom violate them with impunity The weak enervated women who particularly catch the attention of libertines are unfit to be mothers  though they may conceive so that the rich sensualist who has rioted among women spreading depravity and misery when he wishes to perpetuate his name receives from his wife only an halfformed being that inherits both its father's and mother's weakness  Contrasting the humanity of the present age with the barbarism of antiquity great stress has been laid on the savage custom of exposing the children whom their parents could not maintain whilst the man of sensibility who thus perhaps complains by his promiscuous amours produces a most destructive barrenness and contagious flagitiousness of manners Surely nature never intended that women by satisfying an appetite should frustrate the very purpose for which it was implanted  I have before observed that men ought to maintain the women whom they have seduced this would be one means of reforming female manners and stopping an abuse that has an equally fatal effect on population and morals Another no less obvious would be to turn the attention of woman to the real virtue of chastity for to little respect has that woman a  claim on the score of modesty though her reputation may be white as the driven snow who smiles on the libertine whilst she spurns the victims of his lawless appetites and their own folly  Besides she has a taint of the same folly pure as she esteems herself when she studiously adorns her person only to be seen by men to excite respectful sighs and all the idle homage of what is called innocent gallantry Did women really respect virtue for its own sake they would not seek for a compensation in vanity for the selfdenial which they are obliged to practise to preserve their reputation nor would they associate with men who set reputation at defiance  The two sexes mutually corrupt and improve each other This I believe to be an indisputable truth extending it to every virtue Chastity modesty public spirit and all the noble train of virtues on which social virtue and happiness is built should be understood and cultivated by all mankind or they will be cultivated to little effect And instead of furnishing the vicious or idle with a pretext for violating some sacred duty by terming it a sexual one it would be wiser to  shew that nature has not made any difference for that the unchaste man doubly defeats the purpose of nature by rendering women barren and destroying his own constitution though he avoids the shame that pursues the crime in the other sex These are the physical consequences the moral are still more alarming for virtue is only a nominal distinction when the duties of citizens husbands wives fathers mothers and directors of families become merely the selfish ties of convenience  Why then do philosophers look for public spirit Public spirit must be nurtured by private virtue or it will resemble the factitious sentiment which makes women careful to preserve their reputation and men their honour A sentiment that often exists unsupported by virtue unsupported by that sublime morality which makes the habitual breach of one duty a breach of the whole moral law  CHAP IX OF THE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS WHICH ARISE FROM THE UNNATURAL DISTINCTIONS ESTABLISHED IN SOCIETY  FROM the respect paid to property flow as from a poisoned fountain most of the evils and vices which render this world such a dreary scene to the contemplative mind For it is in the most polished society that noisome reptiles and venomous serpents lurk under the rank herbage and there is voluptuousness pampered by the still sultry air which relaxes every good disposition before it ripens into virtue  One class presses on another for all are aiming to procure respect on account of their property and property once gained will procure the respect due only to talents and virtue Men neglect the duties incumbent on man yet are treated like demigods religion is also separated from morality by a ceremonial veil yet men wonder that the world  is almost literally speaking a den of sharpers or oppressors  There is a homely proverb which speaks a shrewd truth that whoever the devil finds idle he will employ And what but habitual idleness can hereditary wealth and titles produce For man is so constituted that he can only attain a proper use of his faculties by exercising them and will not exercise them unless necessity of some kind first set the wheels in motion Virtue likewise can only be acquired by the discharge of relative duties but the importance of these sacred duties will scarcely be felt by the being who is cajoled out of his humanity by the flattery of sycophants There must be more equality established in society or morality will never gain ground and this virtuous equality will not rest firmly even when founded on a rock if one half of mankind are chained to its bottom by fate for they will be continually undermining it through ignorance or pride  It is vain to expect virtue from women till they are in some degree independent of men nay it is vain to expect that strength of natural affection which would make them good wives and mothers Whilst they are absolutely dependent on their husbands they  will be cunning mean and selfish and the men who can be gratified by the fawning fondness of spaniellike affection have not much delicacy for love is not to be bought in any sense of the words its silken wings are instantly shrivelled up when any thing beside a return in kind is sought Yet whilst wealth enervates men and women live as it were by their personal charms how can we expect them to discharge those ennobling duties which equally require exertion and selfdenial Hereditary property sophisticates the mind and the unfortunate victims to it if I may so express myself swathed from their birth seldom exert the locomotive faculty of body or mind and thus viewing every thing through one medium and that a false one they are unable to discern in what true merit and happiness consist False indeed must be the light when the drapery of situation hides the man and makes him stalk in masquerade dragging from one scene of dissipation to another the nerveless limbs that hang with stupid listlessness and rolling round the vacant eye which plainly tells us that there is no mind at home  I mean therefore to infer that the society is not properly organized which does not  compel men and women to discharge their respective duties by making it the only way to acquire that countenance from their fellowcreatures which every human being wishes some way to attain The respect consequently which is paid to wealth and mere personal charms is a true northeast blast that blights the tender blossoms of affection and virtue Nature has wisely attached affections to duties to sweeten toil and to give that vigour to the exertions of reason which only the heart can give But the affection which is put on merely because it is the appropriated insignia of a certain character when its duties are not fulfilled is one of the empty compliments which vice and folly are obliged to pay to virtue and the real nature of things  To illustrate my opinion I need only observe that when a woman is admired for her beauty and suffers herself to be so far intoxicated by the admiration she receives as to neglect to discharge the indispensable duty of a mother she sins against herself by neglecting to cultivate an affection that would equally tend to make her useful and happy True happiness I mean all the contentment and  virtuous satisfaction that can be snatched in this imperfect state must arise from well regulated affections and an affection includes a duty Men are not aware of the misery they cause and the vicious weakness they cherish by only inciting women to render themselves pleasing they do not consider that they thus make natural and artificial duties clash by sacrificing the comfort and respectability of a woman's life to voluptuous notions of beauty when in nature they all harmonize  Cold would be the heart of a husband were he not rendered unnatural by early debauchery who did not feel more delight at seeing his child suckled by its mother than the most artful wanton tricks could ever raise yet this natural way of cementing the matrimonial tie and twisting esteem with fonder recollections wealth leads women to spurn To preserve their beauty and wear the flowery crown of the day that gives them a kind of right to reign for a short time over the sex they neglect to stamp impressions on their husbands' hearts that would be remembered with more tenderness when the snow on the head began to chill the bosom than  even their virgin charms The maternal solicitude of a reasonable affectionate woman is very interesting and the chastened dignity with which a mother returns the caresses that she and her child receive from a father who has been fulfilling the serious duties of his station is not only a respectable but a beautiful sight So singular indeed are my feelings and I have endeavoured not to catch factitious ones that after having been fatigued with the sight of insipid grandeur and the slavish ceremonies that with cumberous pomp supplied the place of domestic affections I have turned to some other scene to relieve my eye by resting it on the refreshing green every where scattered by nature I have then viewed with pleasure a woman nursing her children and discharging the duties of her station with perhaps merely a servant maid to take off her hands the servile part of the household business I have seen her prepare herself and children with only the luxury of cleanliness to receive her husband who returning weary home in the evening found smiling babes and a clean hearth My heart has loitered in the midst of the group and has even throbbed with sympathetic emotion  when the scraping of the well known foot has raised a pleasing tumult  Whilst my benevolence has been gratified by contemplating this artless picture I have thought that a couple of this description equally necessary and independent of each other because each fulfilled the respective duties of their station possessed all that life could giveRaised sufficiently above abject poverty not to be obliged to weigh the consequence of every farthing they spend and having sufficient to prevent their attending to a frigid system of oeconomy which narrows both heart and mind I declare so vulgar are my conceptions that I know not what is wanted to render this the happiest as well as the most respectable situation in the world but a taste for literature to throw a little variety and interest into social converse and some superfluous money to give to the needy and to buy books For it is not pleasant when the heart is opened by compassion and the head active in arranging plans of usefulness to have a prim urchin continually twitching back the elbow to prevent the hand from drawing out an almost empty purse whispering at the same time some  prudential maxim about the priority of justice  Destructive however as riches and inherited honours are to the human character women are more debased and cramped if possible by them than men because men may still in some degree unfold their faculties by becoming soldiers and statesmen  As soldiers I grant they can now only gather for the most part vain glorious laurels whilst they adjust to a hair the European balance taking especial care that no bleak northern nook or sound incline the beam But the days of true heroism are over when a citizen fought for his country like a Fabricius or a Washington and then returned to his farm to let his virtuous fervour run in a more placid but not a less salutary stream No our British heroes are oftener sent from the gaming table than from the plow and their passions have been rather inflamed by hanging with dumb suspense on the turn of a die than sublimated by panting after the adventurous march of virtue in the historic page  The statesman it is true might with more propriety quit the Faro Bank or cardtable to  guide the helm for he has still but to shuffle and trick The whole system of British politics if system it may courteously be called consisting in multiplying dependents and contriving taxes which grind the poor to pamper the rich thus a war or any wild goose chace is as the vulgar use the phrase a lucky turnup of patronage for the minister whose chief merit is the art of keeping himself in place  It is not necessary then that he should have bowels for the poor so he can secure for his family the odd trick Or should some shew of respect for what is termed with ignorant ostentation an Englishman's birthright be expedient to bubble the gruff mastiff that he has to lead by the nose he can make an empty shew very safely by giving his single voice and suffering his light squadron to file off to the other side And when a question of humanity is agitated he may dip a sop in the milk of human kindness to silence Cerberus and talk of the interest which his heart takes in an attempt to make the earth no longer cry for vengeance as it sucks in its children's blood though his cold hand may at the very moment rivet their chains by sanctioning  the abominable traffick A minister is no longer a minister than while he can carry a point which he is determined to carryYet it is not necessary that a minister should feel like a man when a bold push might shake his seat  But to have done with these episodical observations let me return to the more specious slavery which chains the very soul of woman keeping her for ever under the bondage of ignorance  The preposterous distinctions of rank which render civilization a curse by dividing the world between voluptuous tyrants and cunning envious dependents corrupt almost equally every class of people because respectability is not attached to the discharge of the relative duties of life but to the station and when the duties are not fulfilled the affections cannot gain sufficient strength to fortify the virtue of which they are the natural reward Still there are some loopholes out of which a man may creep and dare to think and act for himself but for a woman it is an herculean task because she has difficulties peculiar to her sex to overcome which require almost superhuman powers  A truly benevolent legislator always endeavours to make it the interest of each individual to be virtuous and thus private virtue becoming the cement of public happiness an orderly whole is consolidated by the tendency of all the parts towards a common centre But the private or public virtue of woman is very problematical for Rousseau and a numerous list of male writers insist that she should all her life be subjected to a severe restraint that of propriety Why subject her to proprietyblind propriety if she be capable of acting from a nobler spring if she be an heir of immortality Is sugar always to be produced by vital blood Is one half of the human species like the poor African slaves to be subject to prejudices that brutalize them when principles would be a surer guard only to sweeten the cup of man Is not this indirectly to deny woman reason for a gift is a mockery if it be unfit for use  Women are in common with men rendered weak and luxurious by the relaxing pleasures which wealth procures but added to this they are made slaves to their persons and must render them alluring that man may  lend them his reason to guide their tottering steps aright Or should they be ambitious they must govern their tyrants by sinister tricks for without rights there cannot be any incumbent duties The laws respecting woman which I mean to discuss in a future part make an absurd unit of a man and his wife and then by the easy transition of only considering him as responsible she is reduced to a mere cypher  The being who discharges the duties of its station is independent and speaking of women at large their first duty is to themselves as rational creatures and the next in point of importance as citizens is that which includes so many of a mother The rank in life which dispenses with their fulfilling this duty necessarily degrades them by making them mere dolls Or should they turn to something more important than merely fitting drapery upon a smooth block their minds are only occupied by some soft platonic attachment or the actual management of an intrigue may keep their thoughts in motion for when they neglect domestic duties they have it not in their power to take the field and march and countermarch like soldiers  or wrangle in the senate to keep their faculties from rusting  I know that as a proof of the inferiority of the sex Rousseau has exultingly exclaimed How can they leave the nursery for the camp And the camp has by some moralists been termed the school of the most heroic virtues though I think it would puzzle a keen casuist to prove the reasonableness of the greater number of wars that have dubbed heroes I do not mean to consider this question critically because having frequently viewed these freaks of ambition as the first natural mode of civilization when the ground must be torn up and the woods cleared by fire and sword I do not choose to call them pests but surely the present system of war has little connection with virtue of any denomination being rather the school of  finesse  and effeminacy than of fortitude  Yet if defensive war the only justifiable war in the present advanced state of society where virtue can shew its face and ripen amidst the rigours which purify the air on the mountain's top were alone to be adopted as just and glorious the true heroism of antiquity might again animate female bosoms  But fair and softly gentle reader male or female do not alarm thyself for though I have contrasted the character of a modern soldier with that of a civilized woman I am not going to advise them to turn their distaff into a musket though I sincerely wish to see the bayonet converted into a pruninghook I only recreated an imagination fatigued by contemplating the vices and follies which all proceed from a feculent stream of wealth that has muddied the pure rills of natural affection by supposing that society will some time or other be so constituted that man must necessarily fulfil the duties of a citizen or be despised and that while he was employed in any of the departments of civil life his wife also an active citizen should be equally intent to manage her family educate her children and assist her neighbours  But to render her really virtuous and useful she must not if she discharge her civil duties want individually the protection of civil laws she must not be dependent on her husband's bounty for her subsistence during his life or support after his deathfor how can a being be generous who has nothing of its own or virtuous who is not free  The wife in the present state of things who is faithful to her husband and neither suckles nor educates her children scarcely deserves the name of a wife and has no right to that of a citizen But take away natural rights and there is of course an end of duties  Women thus infallibly become only the wanton solace of men when they are so weak in mind and body that they cannot exert themselves unless to pursue some frothy pleasure or to invent some frivolous fashion What can be a more melancholy sight to a thinking mind than to look into the numerous carriages that drive helterskelter about this metropolis in a morning full of palefaced creatures who are flying from themselves I have often wished with Dr Johnson to place some of them in a little shop with half a dozen children looking up to their languid countenances for support I am much mistaken if some latent vigour would not soon give health and spirit to their eyes and some lines drawn by the exercise of reason on the blank cheeks which before were only undulated by dimples might restore lost dignity to the character or rather enable it to attain the true dignity of its nature Virtue is not to  be acquired even by speculation much less by the negative supineness that wealth naturally generates  Besides when poverty is more disgraceful than even vice is not morality cut to the quick Still to avoid misconstruction though I consider that women in the common walks of life are called to fulfil the duties of wives and mothers by religion and reason I cannot help lamenting that women of a superiour cast have not a road open by which they can pursue more extensive plans of usefulness and independence I may excite laughter by dropping an hint which I mean to pursue some future time for I really think that women ought to have representatives instead of being arbitrarily governed without having any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government  But as the whole system of representation is now in this country only a convenient handle for despotism they need not complain for they are as well represented as a numerous class of hard working mechanics who pay for the support of royalty when they can scarcely stop their children's mouths with bread How are they represented whose very  sweat supports the splendid stud of an heir apparent or varnishes the chariot of some female favourite who looks down on shame Taxes on the very necessaries of life enable an endless tribe of idle princes and princesses to pass with stupid pomp before a gaping crowd who almost worship the very parade which costs them so dear This is mere gothic grandeur something like the barbarous useless parade of having sentinels on horseback at Whitehall which I could never view without a mixture of contempt and indignation  How strangely must the mind be sophisticated when this sort of state impresses it But till these monuments of folly are levelled by virtue similar follies will leaven the whole mass For the same character in some degree will prevail in the aggregate of society and the refinements of luxury or the vicious repinings of envious poverty will equally banish virtue from society considered as the characteristic of that society or only allow it to appear as one of the stripes of the harlequin coat worn by the civilized man  In the superiour ranks of life every duty is done by deputies as if duties could ever  be waved and the vain pleasures which consequent idleness forces the rich to pursue appear so enticing to the next rank that the numerous scramblers for wealth sacrifice every thing to tread on their heels The most sacred trusts are then considered as sinecures because they were procured by interest and only sought to enable a man to keep  good company  Women in particular all want to be ladies Which is simply to have nothing to do but listlessly to go they scarcely care where for they cannot tell what  But what have women to do in society I may be asked but to loiter with easy grace surely you would not condemn them all to suckle fools and chronicle small beer No Women might certainly study the art of healing and be physicians as well as nurses And midwifery decency seems to allot to them though I am afraid the word midwife in our dictionaries will soon give place to  accoucheur  and one proof of the former delicacy of the sex be effaced from the language  They might also study politics and settle their benevolence on the broadest basis for the reading of history will scarcely be more  useful than the perusal of romances if read as mere biography if the character of the times the political improvements arts c be not observed In short if it be not considered as the history of man and not of particular men who filled a niche in the temple of fame and dropped into the black rolling stream of time that silently sweeps all before it into the shapeless void called eternityFor shape can it be called  that shape hath none  Business of various kinds they might likewise pursue if they were educated in a more orderly manner which might save many from common and legal prostitution Women would not then marry for a support as men accept of places under government and neglect the implied duties nor would an attempt to earn their own subsistence a most laudable one sink them almost to the level of those poor abandoned creatures who live by prostitution For are not milliners and mantuamakers reckoned the next class The few employments open to women so far from being liberal are menial and when a superiour education enables them to take charge of the education of children as governesses  they are not treated like the tutors of sons though even clerical tutors are not always treated in a manner calculated to render them respectable in the eyes of their pupils to say nothing of the private comfort of the individual But as women educated like gentlewomen are never designed for the humiliating situation which necessity sometimes forces them to fill these situations are considered in the light of a degradation and they know little of the human heart who need to be told that nothing so painfully sharpens the sensibility as such a fall in life  Some of these women might be restrained from marrying by a proper spirit or delicacy and others may not have had it in their power to escape in this pitiful way from servitude is not that government then very defective and very unmindful of the happiness of one half of its members that does not provide for honest independent women by encouraging them to fill respectable stations But in order to render their private virtue a public benefit they must have a civil existence in the state married or single else we shall continually see some worthy woman whose  sensibility has been rendered painfully acute by undeserved contempt droop like  the lily broken down by a plowshare  It is a melancholy truth yet such is the blessed effect of civilization the most respectable women are the most oppressed and unless they have understandings far superiour to the common run of understandings taking in both sexes they must from being treated like contemptible beings become contemptible How many women thus waste life away the prey of discontent who might have practised as physicians regulated a farm managed a shop and stood erect supported by their own industry instead of hanging their heads surcharged with the dew of sensibility that consumes the beauty to which it at first gave lustre nay I doubt whether pity and love are so near akin as poets feign for I have seldom seen much compassion excited by the helplessness of females unless they were fair then perhaps pity was the soft handmaid of love or the harbinger of lust  How much more respectable is the woman who earns her own bread by fulfilling any duty than the most accomplished beauty beauty did I sayso sensible am I of the beauty of moral loveliness or the harmonious  propriety that attunes the passions of a wellregulated mind that I blush at making the comparison yet I sigh to think how few women aim at attaining this respectability by withdrawing from the giddy whirl of pleasure or the indolent calm that stupifies the good sort of women it fucks in  Proud of their weakness however they must always be protected guarded from care and all the rough toils that dignify the mindIf this be the fiat of fate if they will make themselves insignificant and contemptible sweetly to waste 'life away' let them not expect to be valued when their beauty fades for it is the fate of the fairest flowers to be admired and pulled to pieces by the careless hand that plucked them In how many ways do I wish from the purest benevolence to impress this truth on my sex yet I fear that they will not listen to a truth that dear bought experience has brought home to many an agitated bosom nor willingly resign the privileges of rank and sex for the privileges of humanity to which those have no claim who do not discharge its duties  Those writers are particularly useful in my opinion who make man feel for man  independent of the station he fills or the drapery of factitious sentiments I then would fain convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observationsI appeal to their understandings and as a fellowcreature claim in the name of my sex some interest in their hearts I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion to make her a help meet for them  Would men but generously snap our chains and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience they would find us more observant daughters more affectionate sisters more faithful wives more reasonable mothersin a word better citizens We should then love them with true affection because we should learn to respect ourselves and the peace of mind of a worthy man would not be interrupted by the idle vanity of his wife nor his babes sent to nestle in a strange bosom having never found a home in their mother's  CHAP X PARENTAL AFFECTION  PARENTAL affection is perhaps the blindest modification of perverse selflove for we have not like the French  L'amour propre L'amour de soi mÃ©me  two terms to distinguish the pursuit of a natural and reasonable desire from the ignorant calculations of weakness Parents often love their children in the most brutal manner and sacrifice every relative duty to promote their advancement in the worldTo promote such is the perversity of unprincipled prejudices the future welfare of the very beings whose present existence they imbitter by the most despotic stretch of power Power in fact is ever true to its vital principle for in every shape it would reign without controul or inquiry Its throne is built across a dark abyss which no eye must dare to explore lest the baseless fabric should totter under investigation Obedience unconditional  obedience is the catchword of tyrants of every description and to render 'assurance doubly sure' one kind of despotism supports another Tyrants would have cause to tremble if reason were to become the rule of duty in any of the relations of life for the light might spread till perfect day appeared And when it did appear how would men smile at the sight of the bugbears at which they started during the night of ignorance or the twilight of timid inquiry  Parental affection indeed in many minds is but a pretext to tyrannize where it can be done with impunity for only good and wise men are content with the respect that will bear discussion Convinced that they have a right to what they insist on they do not fear reason or dread the sifting of subjects that recur to natural justice because they firmly believe that the more enlightened the human mind becomes the deeper root will just and simple principles take They do not rest in expedients or grant that what is metaphysically true can be practically false but disdaining the shifts of the moment they calmly wait till time sanctioning innovation silences the hiss of selfishness or envy  If the power of reflecting on the past and darting the keen eye of contemplation into futurity be the grand privilege of man it must be granted that some people enjoy this prerogative in a very limited degree Every thing now appears to them wrong and not able to distinguish the possible from the monstrous they fear where no fear should find a place running from the light of reason as if it were a firebrand yet the limits of the possible have never been defined to stop the sturdy innovator's hand  Woman however a slave in every situation to prejudice seldom exerts enlightened maternal affection for she either neglects her children or spoils them by improper indulgence Besides the affection of some women for their children is as I have before termed it frequently very brutish for it eradicates every spark of humanity Justice truth every thing is sacrificed by these Rebekah's and for the sake of their  own  children they violate the most sacred duties forgetting the common relationship that binds the whole family on earth together Yet reason seems to say that they who suffer one duty or affection to swallow up the rest have not sufficient  heart or mind to fulfil that one conscientiously It then loses the venerable aspect of a duty and assumes the fantastic form of a whim  As the care of children in their infancy is one of the grand duties annexed to the female character by nature this duty would afford many forcible arguments for strengthening the female understanding if it were properly considered  The formation of the mind must be begun very early and the temper in particular requires the most judicious attentionan attention which women cannot pay who only love their children because they are their children and seek no further for the foundation of their duty than in the feelings of the moment It is this want of reason in their affections which makes women so often run into extremes and either be the most fond or most careless and unnatural mothers  To be a good mothera woman must have sense and that independence of mind which few women possess who are taught to depend entirely on their husbands Meek wives are in general foolish mothers wanting their children to love them best and take their part in secret against the father who is  held up as a scarecrow If they are to be punished though they have offended the mother the father must inflict the punishment he must be the judge in all disputes but I shall more fully discuss this subject when I treat of private education I now only mean to insist that unless the understanding of woman be enlarged and her character rendered more firm by being allowed to govern her own conduct she will never have sufficient sense or command of temper to manage her children properly Her parental affection indeed scarcely deserves the name when it does not lead her to suckle her children because the discharge of this duty is equally calculated to inspire maternal and filial affection and it is the indispensable duty of men and women to fulfil the duties which give birth to affections that are the surest preservatives against vice Natural affection as it is termed I believe to be a very faint tie affections must grow out of the habitual exercise of a mutual sympathy and what sympathy does a mother exercise who sends her babe to a nurse and only takes it from a nurse to send it to a school  In the exercise of their maternal feelings providence has furnished women with a natural substitute for love when the lover becomes only a friend and mutual confidence takes place of overstrained admirationa child then gently twists the relaxing cord and a mutual care produces a new mutual sympathyBut a child though a pledge of affection will not enliven it if both father and mother are content to transfer the charge to hirelings for they who do their duty by proxy should not murmur if they miss the reward of dutyparental affection produces filial duty  CHAP XI DUTY TO PARENTS  THERE seems to be an indolent propensity in man to make prescription always take place of reason and to place every duty on an arbitrary foundation The rights of kings are deduced in a direct line from the King of kings and that of parents from our first parent  Why do we thus go back for principles that should always rest on the same base and have the same weight today that they had a thousand years agoand not a jot more If parents discharge their duty they have a strong hold and sacred claim on the gratitude of their children but few parents are willing to receive the respectful affection of their offspring on such terms They demand blind obedience because they do not merit a reasonable service and to render these demands of weakness and ignorance more binding a mysterious sanctity is spread round the most  arbitrary principle for what other name can be given to the blind duty of obeying vicious or weak beings merely because they obeyed a powerful instinct  The simple definition of the reciprocal duty which naturally subsists between parent and child may be given in a few words The parent who pays proper attention to helpless infancy has a right to require the same attention when the feebleness of age comes upon him But to subjugate a rational being to the mere will of another after he is of age to answer to society for his own conduct is a most cruel and undue stretch of power and perhaps as injurious to morality as those religious systems which do not allow right and wrong to have any existence but in the Divine will  I never knew a parent who had paid more than common attention to his children disregarded  Dr Johnson makes the same observation  on the contrary the early habit of relying almost implicitly on the opinion of a respected parent is not easily shook even when matured reason convinces the child that his father is not the wisest man in the world This weakness for a weakness it is though  the epithet amiable may be tacked to it a reasonable man must steel himself against for the absurd duty too often inculcated of obeying a parent only on account of his being a parent shackles the mind and prepares it for a slavish submission to any power but reason  I distinguish between the natural and accidental duty due to parents  The parent who sedulously endeavours to form the heart and enlarge the understanding of his child has given that dignity to the discharge of a duty common to the whole animal world that only reason can give This is the parental affection of humanity and leaves instinctive natural affection far behind Such a parent acquires all the rights of the most sacred friendship and his advice even when his child is advanced in life demands serious consideration  With respect to marriage though after one and twenty a parent seems to have no right to withhold his consent on any account yet twenty years of solicitude call for a return and the son ought at least to promise not to marry for two or three years should  the object of his choice not entirely meet with the approbation of his first friend  But respect for parents is generally speaking a much more debasing principle it is only a selfish respect for property The father who is blindly obeyed is obeyed from sheer weakness or from motives that degrade the human character  A great proportion of the misery that wanders in hideous forms around the world is allowed to rise from the negligence of parents and still these are the people who are most tenacious of what they term a natural right though it be subversive of the birthright of man the right of acting according to the direction of his own reason  I have already very frequently had occasion to observe that vicious or indolent people are always eager to profit by enforcing arbitrary privileges and generally in the same proportion as they neglect the discharge of the duties which alone render the privileges reasonable This is at the bottom a dictate of common sense or the instinct of selfdefence peculiar to ignorant weakness resembling  that instinct which makes a fish muddy the water it swims in to elude its enemy instead of boldly facing it in the clear stream  From the clear stream of argument indeed the supporters of prescription of every denomination fly and taking refuge in the darkness which in the language of sublime poetry has been supposed to surround the throne of Omnipotence they dare to demand that implicit respect which is only due to His unsearchable ways But let me not be thought presumptuous the darkness which hides our God from us only respects speculative truthsit never obscures moral ones they shine clearly for God is light and never by the constitution of our nature requires the discharge of a duty the reasonableness of which does not beam on us when we open our eyes  The indolent parent of high rank may it is true extort a shew of respect from his child and females on the continent are particularly subject to the views of their families who never think of consulting their inclination or providing for the comfort of the poor victims of their pride The consequence is notorious these dutiful daughters become  adulteresses and neglect the education of their children from whom they in their turn exact the same kind of obedience  Females it is true in all countries are too much under the dominion of their parents and few parents think of addressing their children in the following manner though it is in this reasonable way that Heaven seems to command the whole human race It is your interest to obey me till you can judge for yourself and the Almighty Father of all has implanted an affection in me to serve as a guard to you whilst your reason is unfolding but when your mind arrives at maturity you must only obey me or rather respect my opinions so far as they coincide with the light that is breaking in on your own mind  A slavish bondage to parents cramps every faculty of the mind and Mr Locke very judiciously observes that  if the mind be curbed and humbled too much in children if their spirits be abased and broken much by too strict an hand over them they lose all their vigour and industry  This strict hand may in some degree account for the weakness of women for girls from various causes are more kept down by their parents  in every sense of the word than boys The duty expected from them is like all the duties arbitrarily imposed on women more from a sense of propriety more out of respect for decorum than reason and thus taught slavishly to submit to their parents they are prepared for the slavery of marriage I may be told that a number of women are not slaves in the marriage state True but they then become tyrants for it is not rational freedom but a lawless kind of power resembling the authority exercised by the favourites of absolute monarchs which they obtain by debasing means I do not likewise dream of insinuating that either boys or girls are always slaves I only insist that when they are obliged to submit to authority blindly their faculties are weakened and their tempers rendered imperious or abject I also lament that parents indolently availing themselves of a supposed privilege damp the first faint glimmering of reason rendering at the same time the duty which they are so anxious to enforce an empty name because they will not let it rest on the only basis on which a duty can rest securely for unless it be founded on knowledge it cannot gain sufficient  strength to resist the squalls of passion or the silent sapping of selflove But it is not the parents who have given the surest proof of their affection for their children or to speak more properly who by fulfilling their duty have allowed a natural parental affection to take root in their hearts the child of exercised sympathy and reason and not the overweening offspring of selfish pride who most vehemently insist on their children submitting to their will merely because it is their will On the contrary the parent who sets a good example patiently lets that example work and it seldom fails to produce its natural effectfilial respect  Children cannot be taught too early to submit to reason the true definition of that necessity which Rousseau insisted on without defining it for to submit to reason is to submit to the nature of things and to that God who formed them so to promote our real interest  Why should the minds of children be warped as they just begin to expand only to favour the indolence of parents who insist on a privilege without being willing to pay the price fixed by nature I have before had  occasion to observe that a right always includes a duty and I think it may likewise fairly be inferred that they forfeit the right who do not fulfil the duty  It is easier I grant to command than reason but it does not follow from hence that children cannot comprehend the reason why they are made to do certain things habitually for from a steady adherence to a few simple principles of conduct flows that salutary power which a judicious parent gradually gains over a child's mind And this power becomes strong indeed if tempered by an even display of affection brought home to the child's heart For I believe as a general rule it must be allowed that the affection which we inspire always resembles that we cultivate so that natural affections which have been supposed almost distinct from reason may be found more nearly connected with judgment than is commonly allowed Nay as another proof of the necessity of cultivating the female understanding it is but just to observe that the affections seem to have a kind of animal capriciousness when they merely reside in the heart  It is the irregular exercise of parental authority that first injures the mind and to these irregularities girls are more subject than boys The will of those who never allow their will to be disputed unless they happen to be in a good humour when they relax proportionally is almost always unreasonable To elude this arbitrary authority girls very early learn the lessons which they afterwards practise on their husbands for I have frequently seen a little sharpfaced miss rule a whole family excepting that now and then mamma's angry will burst out of some accidental cloudeither her hair was ill dressed  I myself heard a little girl once say to a servant  My mamma has been scolding me finely this morning because her hair was not dressed to please her  Though this remark was pert it was just And what respect could a girl acquire for such a parent without doing violence to reason  or she had lost more money at cards the night before than she was willing to own to her husband or some such moral cause of anger  After observing sallies of this kind I have been led into a melancholy train of reflection  respecting females concluding that when their first affection must lead them astray or make their duties clash till they rest on mere whims and customs little can be expected from them as they advance in life How indeed can an instructor remedy this evil for to teach them virtue on any solid principle is to teach them to despise their parents Children cannot ought not to be taught to make allowance for the faults of their parents because every such allowance weakens the force of reason in their minds and makes them still more indulgent to their own It is one of the most sublime virtues of maturity that leads us to be severe with respect to ourselves and forbearing to others but children should only be taught the simple virtues for if they begin too early to make allowance for human passions and manners they wear off the fine edge of the criterion by which they should regulate their own and become unjust in the same proportion as they grow indulgent  The affections of children and weak people are always selfish they love others because they love them and not on account of their virtues Yet till esteem and love  are blended together in the first affection and reason made the foundation of the first duty morality will stumble at the threshold But till society is very differently constituted parents I fear will still insist on being obeyed because they will be obeyed and constantly endeavour to settle that power on a Divine right which will not bear the investigation of reason  CHAP XII ON NATIONAL EDUCATION  THE good effects resulting from attention to private education will ever be very confined and the parent who really puts his own hand to the plow will always in some degree be disappointed till education become a grand national concern A man cannot retire into a desert with his child and if he did he could not bring himself back to childhood and become the proper friend and playfellow of an infant or youth And when children are confined to the society of men and women they very soon acquire that kind of premature manhood which stops the growth of every vigorous power of mind or body In order to open their faculties they should be excited to think for themselves and this can only be done by mixing a number of children together and making them jointly pursue the same objects  A child very soon contracts a benumbing indolence of mind which he has seldom sufficient vigour afterwards to shake off when he only asks a question instead of seeking for information and then relies implicitly on the answer he receives With his equals in age this could never be the case and the subjects of inquiry though they might be influenced would not be entirely under the direction of men who frequently damp if not destroy abilities by bringing them forward too hastily and too hastily they will infallibly be brought forward if the child be confined to the society of a man however sagacious that man may be  Besides in youth the seeds of every affection should be sown and the respectful regard which is felt for a parent is very different from the social affections that are to constitute the happiness of life as it advances Of these equality is the basis and an intercourse of sentiments unclogged by that observant seriousness which prevents disputation though it may not inforce submission Let a child have ever such an affection for his parent he will always languish to play and chat with children and the very respect  which he entertains for filial esteem always has a dash of fear mixed with it will if it do not teach him cunning at least prevent him from pouring out the little secrets which first open the heart to friendship and confidence gradually leading to more expansive benevolence Added to this he will never acquire that frank ingenuousness of behaviour which young people can only attain by being frequently in society where they dare to speak what they think neither afraid of being reproved for their presumption nor laughed at for their folly  Forcibly impressed by the reflections which the sight of schools as they are at present conducted naturally suggested I have formerly delivered my opinion rather warmly in favour of a private education but further experience has led me to view the subject in a different light I still however think schools as they are now regulated the hotbeds of vice and folly and the knowledge of human nature supposed to be attained there merely cunning selfishness  At school boys become gluttons and slovens and instead of cultivating domestic affections very early rush into the libertinism which  destroys the constitution before it is formed hardening the heart as it weakens the understanding  I should in fact be averse to boardingschools if it were for no other reason than the unsettled state of mind which the expectation of the vacations produce On these the children's thoughts are fixed with eager anticipating hopes for at least to speak with moderation half of the time and when they arrive they are spent in total dissipation and beastly indulgence  But on the contrary when they are brought up at home though they may pursue a plan of study in a more orderly manner than can be adopted when near a fourth part of the year is actually spent in idleness and as much more in regret and anticipation yet they there acquire too high an opinion of their own importance from being allowed to tyrannize over servants and from the anxiety expressed by most mothers on the score of manners who eager to teach the accomplishments of a gentleman stifle in their birth the virtues of a man Thus brought into company when they ought to be seriously employed and treated like men when  they are still boys they become vain and effeminate  The only way to avoid two extremes equally injurious to morality would be to contrive some way of combining a public and private education Thus to make men citizens two natural steps might be taken which seem directly to lead to the desired point for the domestic affections that first open the heart to the various modifications of humanity would be cultivated whilst the children were nevertheless allowed to spend great part of their time on terms of equality with other children  I still recollect with pleasure the country day school where a boy trudged in the morning wet or dry carrying his books and his dinner if it were at a considerable distance a servant did not then lead master by the hand for when he had once put on coat and breeches he was allowed to shift for himself and return alone in the evening to recount the feats of the day close at the parental knee His father's house was his home and was ever after fondly remembered nay I appeal to some superiour men who were educated in this manner whether  the recollection of some shady lane where they conned their lesson or of some stile where they sat making a kite or mending a bat has not endeared their country to them  But what boy ever recollected with pleasure the years he spent in close confinement at an academy near London unless indeed he should by chance remember the poor scarecrow of an usher whom he tormented or the tartman from whom he caught a cake to devour it with the catish appetite of selfishness At boardingschools of every description the relaxation of the junior boys is mischief and of the senior vice Besides in great schools what can be more prejudicial to the moral character than the system of tyranny and abject slavery which is established amongst the boys to say nothing of the slavery to forms which makes religion worse than a farce For what good can be expected from the youth who receives the sacrament of the Lord's supper to avoid forfeiting half a guinea which he probably afterwards spends in some sensual manner Half the employment of the youths is to elude the necessity of attending public worship and well they may for such a constant repetition of the  same thing must be a very irksome restraint on their natural vivacity As these ceremonies have the most fatal effect on their morals and as a ritual performed by the lips when the heart and mind are far away is not now stored up by our church as a bank to draw on for the fees of the poor souls in purgatory why should they not be abolished  But the fear of innovation in this country extends to every thingThis is only a covert fear the apprehensive timidity of indolent slugs who guard by sliming it over the snug place which they consider in the light of an hereditary estate and eat drink and enjoy themselves instead of fulfilling the duties excepting a few empty forms for which it was endowed These are the people who most strenuously insist on the will of the founder being observed crying out against all reformation as if it were a violation of justice I am now alluding particularly to the relicks of popery retained in our colleges when the protestant members seem to be such sticklers for the established church but their zeal never makes them lose sight of the spoil of ignorance which  rapacious priests of superstitious memory have scraped together No wise in their generation they venerate the prescriptive right of possession as a strong hold and still let the sluggish bell tinkle to prayers as during the days when the elevation of the host was supposed to atone for the sins of the people lest one reformation should lead to another and the spirit kill the letter These Romish customs have the most baneful effect on the morals of our clergy for the idle vermin who two or three times a day perform in the most slovenly manner a service which they think useless but call their duty soon lose a sense of duty At college forced to attend or evade public worship they acquire an habitual contempt for the very service the performance of which is to enable them to live in idleness It is mumbled over as an affair of business as a stupid boy repeats his task and frequently the college cant escapes from the preacher the moment after he has left the pulpit and even whilst he is eating the dinner which he earned in such a dishonest manner  Nothing indeed can be more irreverent than the cathedral service as it is now performed  in this country nor does it contain a set of weaker men than those who are the slaves of this childish routine A disgusting skeleton of the former state is still exhibited but all the solemnity that interested the imagination if it did not purify the heart is stripped off The performance of high mass on the continent must impress every mind where a spark of fancy glows with that awful melancholy that sublime tenderness so near akin to devotion I do not say that these devotional feelings are of more use in a moral sense than any other emotion of taste but I contend that the theatrical pomp which gratifies our senses is to be preferred to the cold parade that insults the understanding without reaching the heart  Amongst remarks on national education such observations cannot be misplaced especially as the supporters of these establishments degenerated into puerilities affect to be the champions of religionReligion pure source of comfort in this vale of tears how hast thy clear stream been muddied by the dabblers who have presumptuously endeavoured to confine in one narrow channel the living waters that ever flow towards God  the sublime ocean of existence What would life be without that peace which the love of God when built on humanity alone can impart Every earthly affection turns back at intervals to prey upon the heart that feeds it and the purest effusions of benevolence often rudely damped by man must mount as a freewill offering to Him who gave them birth whose bright image they faintly reflect  In public schools however religion confounded with irksome ceremonies and unreasonable restraints assumes the most ungracious aspect not the sober austere one that commands respect whilst it inspires fear but a ludicrous cast that serves to point a pun For in fact most of the good stories and smart things which enliven the spirits that have been concentrated at whist are manufactured out of the incidents to which the very men labour to give a droll turn who countenance the abuse to live on the spoil  There is not perhaps in the kingdom a more dogmatical or luxurious set of men than the pedantic tyrants who reside in colleges and preside at public schools The vacations are equally injurious to the morals  of the masters and pupils and the intercourse which the former keep up with the nobility introduces the same vanity and extravagance into their families which banishes domestic duties and comforts from the lordly mansion whose state is awkwardly aped on a smaller scale The boys who live at a great expence with the masters and assistants are never domesticated though placed there for that purpose for after a silent dinner they swallow a hasty glass of wine and retire to plan some mischievous trick or to ridicule the person or manners of the very people they have just been cringing to and whom they ought to consider as the representatives of their parents  Can it then be a matter of surprise that boys become selfish and vicious who are thus shut out from social converse or that a mitre often graces the brow of one of these diligent pastors  The desire of living in the same style as the rank just above them infects each individual and every class of people and meanness is the concomitant of this ignoble ambition but those professions are most debasing whose ladder is patronage yet out of one of these professions the tutors of youth are  in general chosen But can they be expected to inspire independent sentiments whose conduct must be regulated by the cautious prudence that is ever on the watch for preferment  So far however from thinking of the morals of boys I have heard several masters of schools argue that they only undertook to teach Latin and Greek and that they had fulfilled their duty by sending some good scholars to college  A few good scholars I grant may have been formed by emulation and discipline but to bring forward these clever boys the health and morals of a number have been sacrificed The sons of our gentry and wealthy commoners are mostly educated at these seminaries and will any one pretend to assert that the majority making every allowance come under the description of tolerable scholars  It is not for the benefit of society that a few brilliant men should be brought forward at the expence of the multitude It is true that great men seem to start up as great revolutions occur at proper intervals to restore order and to blow aside the clouds  that thicken over the face of truth but let more reason and virtue prevail in society and these strong winds would not be necessary Public education of every denomination should be directed to form citizens but if you wish to make good citizens you must first exercise the affections of a son and a brother This is the only way to expand the heart for public affections as well as public virtues must ever grow out of the private character or they are merely meteors that shoot athwart a dark sky and disappear as they are gazed at and admired  Few I believe have had much affection for mankind who did not first love their parents their brothers sisters and even the domestic brutes whom they first played with The exercise of youthful sympathies forms the moral temperature and it is the recollection of these first affections and pursuits that gives life to those that are afterwards more under the direction of reason In youth the fondest friendships are formed the genial juices mounting at the same time kindly mix or rather the heart tempered for the reception of friendship is accustomed to seek for pleasure in something more noble than the churlish gratification of appetite  In order then to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures children ought to be educated at home for riotous holidays only make them fond of home for their own sakes Yet the vacations which do not foster domestic affections continually disturb the course of study and render any plan of improvement abortive which includes temperance still were they abolished children would be entirely separated from their parents and I question whether they would become better citizens by sacrificing the preparatory affections by destroying the force of relationships that render the marriage state as necessary as respectable But if a private education produces selfimportance or insulates a man in his family the evil is only shifted not remedied  This train of reasoning brings me back to a subject on which I mean to dwell the necessity of establishing proper dayschools  But these should be national establishments for whilst schoolmasters are dependent on the caprice of parents little exertion can be expected from them more than is necessary to please ignorant people Indeed the necessity of a master's giving the parents some sample of the boys abilities which during  the vacation is shewn to every visitor  I now particularly allude to the numerous academies in and about London and to the behaviour of the trading part of this great city  is productive of more mischief than would at first be supposed For they are seldom done entirely to speak with moderation by the child itself thus the master countenances falsehood or winds the poor machine up to some extraordinary exertion that injures the wheels and stops the progress of gradual improvement The memory is loaded with unintelligible words to make a shew of without the understanding's acquiring any distinct ideas but only that education deserves emphatically to be termed cultivation of mind which teaches young people how to begin to think The imagination should not be allowed to debauch the understanding before it gained strength or vanity will become the forerunner of vice for every way of exhibiting the acquirements of a child is injurious to its moral character  How much time is lost in teaching them to recite what they do not understand whilst seated on benches all in their best array the mammas listen with astonishment to the  parrotlike prattle uttered in solemn cadences with all the pomp of ignorance and folly Such exhibitions only serve to strike the spreading fibres of vanity through the whole mind for they neither teach children to speak fluently nor behave gracefully So far from it that these frivolous pursuits might comprehensively be termed the study of affectation for we now rarely see a simple bashful boy though few people of taste were ever disgusted by that awkward sheepishness so natural to the age which schools and an early introduction into society have changed into impudence and apish grimace  Yet how can these things be remedied whilst schoolmasters depend entirely on parents for a subsistence and when so many rival schools hang out their lures to catch the attention of vain fathers and mothers whose parental affection only leads them to wish that their children should outshine those of their neighbours  Without great good luck a sensible conscientious man would starve before he could raise a school if he disdained to bubble weak parents by practising the secret tricks of the craft  In the best regulated schools however where swarms are not crammed together many bad habits must be acquired but at common schools the body heart and understanding are equally stunted for parents are often only in quest of the cheapest school and the master could not live if he did not take a much greater number than he could manage himself nor will the scanty pittance allowed for each child permit him to hire ushers sufficient to assist in the discharge of the mechanical part of the business Besides whatever appearance the house and garden may make the children do not enjoy the comfort of either for they are continually reminded by irksome restrictions that they are not at home and the staterooms garden c must be kept in order for the recreation of the parentsâ–ª who of a Sunday visit the school and are impressed by the very parade that renders the situation of their children uncomfortable  With what disgust have I heard sensible women for girls are more restrained and cowed than boys speak of the wearisome confinement which they endured at school Not allowed perhaps to step out of one broad walk in a superb garden and obliged to pace with steady deportment stupidly backwards  and forwards holding up their heads and turning out their toes with shoulders braced back instead of bounding as nature directs to complete her own design in the various attitudes so conducive to health  I remember a circumstance that once came under my own observation and raised my indignation I went to visit a little boy at a school where young children were prepared for a larger one The master took me into the schoolroom c but whilst I walked down a broad gravel walk I could not help observing that the grass grew very luxuriantly on each side of me I immediately asked the child some questions and found that the poor boys were not allowed to stir off the walk and that the master sometimes permitted sheep to be turned in to crop the untrodden grass The tyrant of this domain used to sit by a window that overlooked the prison yard and one nook turning from it where the unfortunate babes could sport freely he enclosed and planted it with potatoes The wife likewise was equally anxious to keep the children in order lest they should dirty or tear their clothes  The pure animal spirits which make both mind and body shoot out and unfold the tender blossoms of hope are turned sour and vented in vain wishes or pert repinings that contract the faculties and spoil the temper else they mount to the brain and sharpening the understanding before it gains proportionable strength produce that pitiful cunning which  disgracefully characterizes the female mind and I fear will ever characterize it whilst women remain the slaves of power  The little respect which the male world pay to chastity is I am persuaded the grand source of many of the physical and moral evils that torment mankind as well as of the vices and follies that degrade and destroy women yet at school boys infallibly lose that decent bashfulness which might have ripened into modesty at home  And what nasty indecent tricks do they also learn from each other when a number of them pig together in the same bedchamber not to speak of the vices which render the body weak whilst they effectually prevent the acquisition of any delicacy of mind The little attention paid to the cultivation of modesty amongst men produces great depravity in all the relationships of society for not only lovelove that ought to purify the heart and first call forth all the youthful powers to prepare the man to discharge the benevolent duties of life is sacrificed to premature lust but all the social affections are deadened by the selfish gratifications which very early pollute the mind and dry up the  generous juices of the heart In what an unnatural manner is innocence often violated and what serious consequences ensue to render private vices a public pest Besides an habit of personal order which has more effect on the moral character than is in general supposed can only be acquired at home where that respectable reserve is kept up which checks the familiarity that sinking into beastliness undermines the affection it insults  I have already animadverted on the bad habits which females acquire when they are shut up together and I think that the observation may fairly be extended to the other sex till the natural inference is drawn which I have had in view throughout that to improve both sexes they ought not only in private families but in public schools to be educated together If marriage be the cement of society mankind should all be educated after the same model or the intercourse of the sexes will never deserve the name of fellowship nor will women ever fulfil the peculiar duties of their sex till they become enlightened citizens till they become free by being enabled to earn their own  subsistence independent of men in the same manner I mean to prevent misconstruction as one man is independent of another Nay marriage will never be held sacred till women by being brought up with men are prepared to be their companions rather than their mistresses for the mean doublings of cunning will ever render them contemptible whilst oppression renders them timid So convinced am I of this truth that I will venture to predict that virtue will never prevail in society till the virtues of both sexes are founded on reason and till the affections common to both are allowed to gain their due strength by the discharge of mutual duties  Were boys and girls permitted to pursue the same studies together those graceful decencies might early be inculcated which produce modesty without those sexual distinctions that taint the mind Lessons of politeness and that formulary of decorum which treads on the heels of falsehood would be rendered useless by habitual propriety of behaviour Not indeed put on for visitors like the courtly robe of politeness but the sober effect of cleanliness of mind Would  not this simple elegance of sincerity be a chaste homage paid to domestic affections far surpassing the meretricious compliments that shine with false lustre in the heartless intercourse of fashionable life But till more understanding preponderate in society there will ever be a want of heart and taste and the harlot's  rouge  will supply the place of that celestial suffusion which only virtuous affections can give to the face Gallantry and what is called love may subsist without simplicity of character but the main pillars of friendship are respect and confidenceesteem is never founded on it cannot tell what  A taste for the fine arts requires great cultivation but not more than a taste for the virtuous affections and both suppose that enlargement of mind which opens so many sources of mental pleasure Why do people hurry to noisy scenes and crowded circles I should answer because they want activity of mind because they have not cherished the virtues of the heart They only therefore see and feel in the gross and continually pine after variety finding every thing that is simple insipid  This argument may be carried further than philosophers are aware of for if nature destined woman in particular for the discharge of domestic duties she made her susceptible of the attached affections in a great degree Now women are notoriously fond of pleasure and naturally must be so according to my definition because they cannot enter into the minutiae of domestic taste lacking judgment the foundation of all taste For the understanding in spite of sensual cavillers reserves to itself the privilege of conveying pure joy to the heart  With what a languid yawn have I seen an admirable poem thrown down that a man of true taste returns to again and again with rapture and whilst melody has almost suspended respiration a lady has asked me where I bought my gown I have seen also an eye glanced coldly over a most exquisite picture rest sparkling with pleasure on a caricature rudely sketched and whilst some terrific feature in nature has spread a sublime stillness through my soul I have been desired to observe the pretty tricks of a lapdog that my perverse fate forced me to travel with Is it surprising that such a tasteless being  should rather caress this dog than her children Or that she should prefer the rant of flattery to the simple accents of sincerity  To illustrate this remark I must be allowed to observe that men of the first genius and most cultivated minds have appeared to have the highest relish for the simple beauties of nature and they must have forcibly felt what they have so well described the charm which natural affections and unsophisticated feelings spread round the human character It is this power of looking into the heart and responsively vibrating with each emotion that enables the poet to personify each passion and the painter to sketch with a pencil of fire  True taste is ever the work of the understanding employed in observing natural effects and till women have more understanding it is vain to expect them to possess domestic taste Their lively senses will ever be at work to harden their hearts and the emotions struck out of them will continue to be vivid and transitory unless a proper education stores their mind with knowledge  It is the want of domestic taste and not the acquirement of knowledge that takes  women out of their families and tears the smiling babe from the breast that ought to afford it nourishment Women have been allowed to remain in ignorance and slavish dependence many very many years and still we hear of nothing but their fondness of pleasure and sway their preference of rakes and soldiers their childish attachment to toys and the vanity that makes them value accomplishments more than virtues  History brings forward a fearful catalogue of the crimes which their cunning has produced when the weak slaves have had sufficient address to overreach their masters In France and in how many other countries have men been the luxurious despots and women the crafty ministersDoes this prove that ignorance and dependence domesticate them Is not their folly the byword of the libertines who relax in their society and do not men of sense continually lament that an immoderate fondness for dress and dissipation carries the mother of a family for ever from home Their hearts have not been debauched by knowledge nor their minds led astray by scientific pursuits yet they do not fulfil the peculiar duties which  as women they are called upon by nature to fulfil On the contrary the state of warfare which subsists between the sexes makes them employ those wiles that frustrate the more open designs of force  When therefore I call women slaves I mean in a political and civil sense for indirectly they obtain too much power and are debased by their exertions to obtain illicit sway  Let an enlightened nation  France  then try what effect reason would have to bring them back to nature and their duty and allowing them to share the advantages of education and government with man see whether they will become better as they grow wiser and become free They cannot be injured by the experiment for it is not in the power of man to render them more insignificant than they are at present  To render this practicable day schools for particular ages should be established by government in which boys and girls might be educated together The school for the younger children from five to nine years of  age ought to be absolutely free and open to all classes  Treating this part of the subject I have borrowed some hints from a very sensible pamphlet written by the late bishop of Autun on Public Education  A sufficient number of masters should also be chosen by a select committee in each parish to whom any complaint of negligence c might be made if signed by six of the children's parents  Ushers would then be unnecessary for I believe experience will ever prove that this kind of subordinate authority is particularly injurious to the morals of youth What indeed can tend to deprave the character more than outward submission and inward contempt Yet how can boys be expected to treat an usher with respect when the master seems to consider him in the light of a servant and almost to countenance the ridicule which becomes the chief amusement of the boys during the play hours  But nothing of this kind could occur in an elementary dayschool where boys and girls the rich and poor should meet together And to prevent any of the distinctions of vanity they should be dressed alike and all obliged to submit to the same discipline  or leave the school The schoolroom ought to be surrounded by a large piece of ground in which the children might be usefully exercised for at this age they should not be confined to any sedentary employment for more than an hour at a time But these relaxations might all be rendered a part of elementary education for many things improve and amuse the senses when introduced as a kind of show to the principles of which dryly laid down children would turn a deaf ear For instance botany mechanics and astronomy Reading writing arithmetic natural history and some simple experiments in natural philosophy might fill up the day but these pursuits should never encroach on gymnastic plays in the open air The elements of religion history the history of man and politics might also be taught by conversations in the socratic form  After the age of nine girls and boys intended for domestic employments or mechanical trades ought to be removed to other schools and receive instruction in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual the two sexes being still together in the  morning but in the afternoon the girls should attend a school where plainwork mantuamaking millinery c would be their employment  The young people of superior abilities or fortune might now be taught in another school the dead and living languages the elements of science and continue the study of history and politics on a more extensive scale which would not exclude polite literature  Girls and boys still together I hear some readers ask yes And I should not fear any other consequence than that some early attachment might take place which whilst it had the best effect on the moral character of the young people might not perfectly agree with the views of the parents for it will be a long time I fear before the world is so enlightened that parents only anxious to render their children virtuous will let them choose companions for life themselves  Besides this would be a sure way to promote early marriages and from early marriages the most salutary physical and moral effects naturally flow What a different character does a married citizen assume from the selfish coxcomb who lives but for himself  and who is often afraid to marry lest he should not be able to live in a certain style Great emergencies excepted which would rarely occur in a society of which equality was the basis a man can only be prepared to discharge the duties of public life by the habitual practice of those inferiour ones which form the man  In this plan of education the constitution of boys would not be ruined by the early debaucheries which now makes men so selfish nor girls rendered weak and vain by indolence and frivolous pursuits But I presuppose that such a degree of equality should be established between the sexes as would shut out gallantry and coquetry yet allow friendship and love to temper the heart for the discharge of higher duties  These would be schools of moralityand the happiness of man allowed to flow from the pure springs of duty and affection what advances might not the human mind make Society can only be happy and free in proportion as it is virtuous but the present distinctions established in society corrode all private and blast all public virtue  I have already inveighed against the custom of confining girls to their needle and shutting them out from all political and civil employments for by thus narrowing their minds they are rendered unfit to fulfil the peculiar duties which nature has assigned them  Only employed about the little incidents of the day they necessarily grow up cunning My very soul has often sickened at observing the sly tricks practised by women to gain some foolish thing on which their silly hearts were set Not allowed to dispose of money or call any thing their own they learn to turn the market penny or should a husband offend by staying from home or give rise to some emotions of jealousya new gown or any pretty bawble smooths Juno's angry brow  But these  littlenesses  would not degrade their character if women were led to respect themselves if political and moral subjects were opened to them and I will venture to affirm that this is the only way to make them properly attentive to their domestic dutiesAn active mind embraces the whole circle of its duties and finds time enough for  all It is not I assert a bold attempt to emulate masculine virtues it is not the enchantment of literary pursuits or the steady investigation of scientific subjects that lead women astray from duty No it is indolence and vanitythe love of pleasure and the love of sway that will reign paramount in an empty mind I say empty emphatically because the education which women now receive scarcely deserves the name For the little knowledge that they are led to acquire during the important years of youth is merely relative to accomplishments and accomplishments without a bottom for unless the understanding be cultivated superficial and monotonous is every grace Like the charms of a made up face they only strike the senses in a crowd but at home wanting mind they want variety The consequence is obvious in gay scenes of dissipation we meet the artificial mind and face for those who fly from solitude dread next to solitude the domestic circle not having it in their power to amuse or interest they feel their own insignificance or find nothing to amuse or interest themselves  Besides what can be more indelicate than a girl's  coming out  in the fashionable world  Which in other words is to bring to market a marriageable miss whose person is taken from one public place to another richly caparisoned Yet mixing in the giddy circle under restraint these butterflies long to flutter at large for the first affection of their souls is their own persons to which their attention has been called with the most sedulous care whilst they were preparing for the period that decides their fate for life Instead of pursuing this idle routine sighing for tasteless shew and heartless state with what dignity would the youths of both sexes form attachments in the schools that I have cursorily pointed out in which as life advanced dancing music and drawing might be admitted as relaxations for at these schools young people of fortune ought to remain more or less till they were of age Those who were designed for particular professions might attend three or four mornings in the week the schools appropriated for their immediate instruction  I only drop these observations at present as hints rather indeed as an outline of the plan I mean than a digested one but I must add that I highly approve of one regulation  mentioned in the pamphlet  The Bishop of Autun's  already alluded to that of making the children and youths independent of the masters respecting punishments They should be tried by their peers which would be an admirable method of fixing sound principles of justice in the mind and might have the happiest effect on the temper which is very early soured or irritated by tyranny till it becomes peevishly cunning or ferociously overbearing  My imagination darts forward with benevolent fervour to greet these amiable and respectable groups in spite of the sneering of cold hearts who are at liberty to utter with frigid selfimportance the damning epithetromantic the force of which I shall endeavour to blunt by repeating the words of an eloquent moralist  I know not whether the allusions of a truly humane heart whose zeal renders every thing easy is not preferable to that rough and repulsing reason which always finds in indifference for the public good the first obstacle to whatever would promote it  I know that libertines will also exclaim that woman would be unsexed by acquiring  strength of body and mind and that beauty soft bewitching beauty would no longer adorn the daughters of men I am of a very different opinion for I think that on the contrary we should then see dignified beauty and true grace to produce which many powerful physical and moral causes would concurNot relaxed beauty it is true nor the graces of helplessness but such as appears to make us respect the human body as a majestic pile fit to receive a noble inhabitant in the relics of antiquity  I do not forget the popular opinion that the Grecian statues were not modelled after nature I mean not according to the proportions of a particular man but that beautiful limbs and features were selected from various bodies to form an harmonious whole This might in some degree be true The fine ideal picture of an exalted imagination might be superiour to the materials which the painter found in nature and thus it might with propriety be termed rather the model of mankind than of a man It was not however the mechanical selection of limbs and features but the ebullition of an heated fancy that burst forth and the fine senses and enlarged  understanding of the artist selected the solid matter which he drew into this glowing focus  I observed that it was not mechanical because a whole was produceda model of that grand simplicity of those concurring energies which arrest our attention and command our reverence For only insipid lifeless beauty is produced by a servile copy of even beautiful nature Yet independent of these observations I believe that the human form must have been far more beautiful than it is at present because extreme indolence barbarous ligatures and many causes which forcibly act on it in our luxurious state of society did not retard its expansion or render it deformed Exercise and cleanliness appear to be not only the surest means of preserving health but of promoting beauty the physical causes only considered yet this is not sufficient moral ones must concur or beauty will be merely of that rustic kind which blooms on the innocent wholesome countenances of some country people whose minds have not been exercised To render the person perfect physical and moral beauty ought to be attained  at the same time each lending and receiving force by the combination Judgment must reside on the brow affection and fancy beam in the eye and humanity curve the cheek or vain is the sparkling of the finest eye or the elegantly turned finish of the fairest features whilst in every motion that displays the active limbs and wellknit joints grace and modesty should appear But this fair assemblage is not to be brought together by chance it is the reward of exertions meet to support each other for judgment can only be acquired by reflection affection by the discharge of duties and humanity by the exercise of compassion to every living creature  Humanity to animals should be particularly inculcated as a part of national education for it is not at present one of our national virtues Tenderness for their humble dumb domestics amongst the lower class is oftener to be found in a savage than a civilized state For civilization prevents that intercourse which creates affection in the rude hut or mud cabin and leads uncultivated minds who are only depraved by the refinements which prevail in the society where they are trodden under foot by the rich to domineer over  them to revenge the insults that they are obliged to bear from their superiours  This habitual cruelty is first caught at school where it is one of the rare sports of the boys to torment the miserable brutes that fall in their way The transition as they grow up from barbarity to brutes to domestic tyranny over wives children and servants is very easy Justice or even benevolence will not be a powerful spring of action unless it be extended to the whole creation nay I believe that it may be delivered as an axiom that those who can see pain unmoved will soon learn to inflict it  The vulgar are swayed by present feelings and the habits which they have accidentally acquired but on partial feelings much dependence cannot be placed though they be just for when they are not invigorated by reflection custom weakens them till they are scarcely felt The sympathies of our nature are strengthened by pondering cogitations and deadened by thoughtless use Macbeth's heart smote him more for one murder the first than for a hundred subsequent ones which were necessary to  back it But when I used the epithet vulgar I did not mean to confine my remark to the poor for partial humanity founded on present sensations or whim is quite as conspicuous if not more so amongst the rich  The lady who sheds tears for the bird starved in a snare and execrates the devils in the shape of men who goad to madness the poor ox or whip the patient ass tottering under a burden above its strength will nevertheless keep her coachman and horses whole hours waiting for her when the sharp frost bites or the rain beats against the wellclosed windows which do not admit a breath of air to tell her how roughly the wind blows without And she who takes her dogs to bed and nurses them with a parade of sensibility when sick will suffer her babes to grow up crooked in a nursery This illustration of my argument is drawn from a matter of fact The woman whom I allude to was handsome reckoned very handsome by those who do not miss the mind when the face is plump and fair but her understanding had not been led from female duties by literature nor her innocence debauched by knowledge No she  was quite feminine according to the masculine acceptation of the word and so far from loving these spoiled brutes that filled the place which her children ought to have occupied she only lisped out a pretty mixture of French and English nonsense to please the men who flocked round her The wife mother and human creature were all swallowed up by the factitious character which an improper education and the selfish vanity of beauty had produced  I do not like to make a distinction without a difference and I own that I have been as much disgusted by the fine lady who took her lapdog to her bosom instead of her child as by the ferocity of a man who beating his horse declared that he knew as well when he did wrong as a Christian  This brood of folly shews how mistaken they are who if they allow women to leave their harems do not cultivate their understandings in order to plant virtues in their hearts For had they sense they might acquire that domestic taste which would lead them to love with reasonable subordination their whole family from their husband to the housedog nor would they ever insult  humanity in the person of the most menial servant by paying more attention to the comfort of a brute than to that of a fellowcreature  My observations on national education are obviously hints but I principally wish to enforce the necessity of educating the sexes together to perfect both and of making children sleep at home that they may learn to love home yet to make private support instead of smothering public affections they should be sent to school to mix with a number of equals for only by the jostlings of equality can we form a just opinion of ourselves  To render mankind more virtuous and happier of course both sexes must act from the same principle but how can that be expected when only one is allowed to see the reasonableness of it To render also the social compact truly equitable and in order to spread those enlightening principles which alone can meliorate the fate of man women must be allowed to found their virtue on knowledge which is scarcely possible unless they are educated by the same pursuits as men For they are now made so inferiour by ignorance and low desires as not to deserve to be  ranked with them or by the serpentine wrigglings of cunning they mount the tree of knowledge and only acquire sufficient to lead men astray  It is plain from the history of all nations that women cannot be confined to merely domestic pursuits for they will not fulfil family duties unless their minds take a wider range and whilst they are kept in ignorance they become in the same proportion the slaves of pleasure as they are the slaves of man Nor can they be shut out of great enterprises though the narrowness of their minds often make them mar what they are unable to comprehend  The libertinism and even the virtues of superior men will always give women of some description great power over them and these weak women under the influence of childish passions and selfish vanity will throw a false light over the objects which the very men view with their eyes who ought to enlighten their judgment Men of fancy and those sanguine characters who mostly hold the helm of human affairs in general relax in the society of women and surely I need not cite to the most superficial reader of history  the numerous examples of vice and oppression which the private intrigues of female favourites have produced not to dwell on the mischief that naturally arises from the blundering interposition of wellmeaning folly For in the transactions of business it is much better to have to deal with a knave than a fool because a knave adheres to some plan and any plan of reason may be seen through much sooner than a sudden flight of folly The power which vile and foolish women have had over wise men who possessed sensibility is notorious I shall only mention one instance  Who ever drew a more exalted female character than Rousseau though in the lump he constantly endeavoured to degrade the sex And why was he thus anxious Truly to justify to himself the affection which weakness and virtue had made him cherish for that fool Theresa He could not raise her to the common level of her sex and therefore he laboured to bring woman down to her's He found her a convenient humble companion and pride made him determine to find some superiour virtues in the being whom he chose to live with but did not her conduct during his life and after his death clearly shew how  grossly he was mistaken who called her a celestial innocent Nay in the bitterness of his heart he himself laments that when his bodily infirmities made him no longer treat her like a woman she ceased to have an affection for him And it was very natural that she should for having so few sentiments in common when the sexual tie was broken what was to hold her To hold her affection whose sensibility was confined to one sex nay to one man it requires sense to turn sensibility into the broad channel of humanity many women have not mind enough to have an affection for a woman or a friendship for a man But the sexual weakness that makes woman depend on man for a subsistence produces a kind of cattish affection which leads a wife to purr about her husband as she would about any man who fed and caressed her  Men are however often gratified by this kind of fondness which is confined in a beastly manner to themselves but should they ever become more virtuous they will wish to converse at their fireside with a friend after they cease to play with a mistress  Besides understanding is necessary to give variety and interest to sensual enjoyments for low indeed in the intellectual scale is the mind that can continue to love when neither virtue nor sense give a human appearance to an animal appetite But sense will always preponderate and if women are not in general brought more on a level with men some superiour women like the Greek courtezans will assemble the men of abilities around them and draw from their families many citizens who would have stayed at home had their wives had more sense or the graces which result from the exercise of the understanding and fancy the legitimate parents of taste A woman of talents if she be not absolutely ugly will always obtain great power raised by the weakness of her sex and in proportion as men acquire virtue and delicacy by the exertion of reason they will look for both in women but they can only acquire them in the same way that men do  In France or Italy have the women confined themselves to domestic life though they have not hitherto had a political existence yet have they not illicitly had great sway corrupting themselves and the men with  whose passions they played In short in whatever light I view the subject reason and experience convince me that the only method of leading women to fulfil their peculiar duties is to free them from all restraint by allowing them to participate the inherent rights of mankind  Make them free and they will quickly become wise and virtuous as men become more so for the improvement must be mutual or the injustice which one half of the human race are obliged to submit to retorting on their oppressors the virtue of men will be wormeaten by the insect whom he keeps under his feet  Let men take their choice man and woman were made for each other though not to become one being and if they will not improve women they will deprave them  I speak of the improvement and emancipation of the whole sex for I know that the behaviour of a few women who by accident or following a strong bent of nature have acquired a portion of knowledge superior to that of the rest of their sex has often been overbearing but there have been instances of women who attaining knowledge  have not discarded modesty nor have they always pedantically appeared to despise the ignorance which they laboured to disperse in their own mind The exclamations then which any advice respecting female learning commonly produce especially from pretty women often arise from envy When they chance to see that even the lustre of their eyes and the flippant sportiveness of refined coquetry will not always secure them attention during a whole evening should a woman of a more cultivated understanding endeavour to give a rational turn to the conversation the common source of consolation is that such women seldom get husbands What arts have I not seen silly women use to interrupt by  flirtation  a very significant word to describe such a manoeuvre a rational conversation which made the men forget that they were pretty women  But allowing what is very natural to man that the possession of rare abilities is really calculated to excite overweening pride disgusting in both men and women in what a state of inferiority must the female faculties have rusted when such a small portion of knowledge as those women  attained who have sneeringly been termed learned women could be singularSufficiently so to puff up the possessor and excite envy in her contemporaries and some of the other sex Nay has not a little rationality exposed many women to the severest censure I advert to well known facts for I have frequently heard women ridiculed and every little weakness exposed only because they adopted the advice of some medical men and deviated from the beaten track in their mode of treating their infants I have actually heard this barbarous aversion to innovation carried still further and a sensible woman stigmatized as an unnatural mother who has thus been wisely solicitous to preserve the health of her children when in the midst of her care she has lost one by some of the casualties of infancy which no prudence can ward off Her acquaintance have observed that this was the consequence of newfangled notions the newfangled notions of ease and cleanliness And those who pretending to experience though they have long adhered to prejudices that have according to the opinion of the most sagacious physicians thinned the human race almost rejoiced at the disaster  that gave a kind of sanction to prescription  Indeed if it were only on this account the national education of women is of the utmost consequence for what a number of human sacrifices are made to that moloch prejudice And in how many ways are children destroyed by the lasciviousness of man The want of natural affection in many women who are drawn from their duty by the admiration of men and the ignorance of others render the infancy of man a much more perilous state than that of brutes yet men are unwilling to place women in situations proper to enable them to acquire sufficient understanding to know how even to nurse their babes  So forcibly does this truth strike me that I would rest the whole tendency of my reasoning upon it for whatever tends to incapacitate the maternal character takes woman out of her sphere  But it is vain to expect the present race of weak mothers either to take that reasonable care of a child's body which is necessary to lay the foundation of a good constitution supposing that it do not suffer for the sins of its  fathers or to manage its temper so judiciously that the child will not have as it grows up to throw off all that its mother its first instructor directly or indirectly taught and unless the mind has uncommon vigour womanish follies will stick to the character throughout life The weakness of the mother will be visited on the children And whilst women are educated to rely on their husbands for judgment this must ever be the consequence for there is no improving an understanding by halves nor can any being act wisely from imitation because in every circumstance of life there is a kind of individuality which requires an exertion of judgment to modify general rules The being who can think justly in one track will soon extend its intellectual empire and she who has sufficient judgment to manage her children will not submit right or wrong to her husband or patiently to the social laws which make a nonentity of a wife  In public schools women to guard against the errors of ignorance should be taught the elements of anatomy and medicine not only to enable them to take proper care of their own health but to make them rational  nurses of their infants parents and husbands for the bills of mortality are swelled by the blunders of selfwilled old women who give nostrums of their own without knowing any thing of the human frame It is likewise proper only in a domestic view to make women acquainted with the anatomy of the mind by allowing the sexes to associate together in every pursuit and by leading them to observe the progress of the human understanding in the improvement of the sciences and arts never forgetting the science of morality nor the study of the political history of mankind  A man has been termed a microcosm and every family might also be called a state States it is true have mostly been governed by arts that disgrace the character of man and the want of a just constitution and equal laws have so perplexed the notions of the worldly wise that they more than question the reasonableness of contending for the rights of humanity Thus morality polluted in the national reservoir sends off streams of vice to corrupt the constituent parts of the body politic but should more noble or rather more just principles  regulate the laws which ought to be the government of society and not those who execute them duty might become the rule of private conduct  Besides by the exercise of their bodies and minds women would acquire that mental activity so necessary in the maternal character united with the fortitude that distinguishes steadiness of conduct from the obstinate perverseness of weakness For it is dangerous to advise the indolent to be steady because they instantly become rigorous and to save themselves trouble punish with severity faults that the patient fortitude of reason might have prevented  But fortitude presupposes strength of mind and is strength of mind to be acquired by indolent acquiescence by asking advice instead of exerting the judgment by obeying through fear instead of practising the forbearance which we all stand in need of ourselvesThe conclusion which I wish to draw is obvious make women rational creatures and free citizens and they will quickly become good wives and mothers that isif men do not neglect the duties of husbands and fathers  Discussing the advantages which a public and private education combined as I have sketched might rationally be expected to produce I have dwelt most on such as are particularly relative to the female world because I think the female world oppressed yet the gangrene which the vices engendered by oppression have produced is not confined to the morbid part but pervades society at large so that when I wish to see my sex become more like moral agents my heart bounds with the anticipation of the general diffusion of that sublime contentment which only morality can diffuse  CHAP XIII SOME INSTANCES OF THE FOLLY WHICH THE IGNORANCE OF WOMEN GENERATES WITH CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS ON THE MORAL IMPROVEMENT THAT A REVOLUTION IN FEMALE MANNERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE  THERE are many follies in some degree peculiar to women sins against reason of commission as well as of omission but all flowing from ignorance or prejudice I shall only point out such as appear to be particularly injurious to their moral character And in animadverting on them I wish especially to prove that the weakness of mind and body which men have endeavoured impelled by various motives to perpetuate prevents their discharging the peculiar duty of their sex for when weakness of body will not permit them to suckle their children and weakness of mind makes them spoil their tempersis woman in a natural state  SECT I  ONE glaring instance of the weakness which proceeds from ignorance first claims attention and calls for severe reproof  In this metropolis a number of lurking leeches infamously gain a subsistence by practising on the credulity of women pretending to cast nativities to use the technical word and many females who proud of their rank and fortune look down on the vulgar with sovereign contempt shew by this credulity that the distinction is arbitrary and that they have not sufficiently cultivated their minds to rise above vulgar prejudices Women because they have not been led to consider the knowledge of their duty as the one thing necessary to know or to live in the present moment by the discharge of it are very anxious to peep into futurity to learn what they have to expect to render life interesting and to break the vacuum of ignorance  I must be allowed to expostulate seriously with the ladies who follow these idle inventions for ladies mistresses of families are not ashamed to drive in their own carriages to the  door of the cunning man  I once lived in the neighbourhood of one of these men a  handsome  man and saw with surprise and indignation women whose appearance and attendance bespoke that rank in which females are supposed to receive a superiour education flock to his door  And if any of them should peruse this work I entreat them to answer to their own hearts the following questions not forgetting that they are in the presence of God  Do you believe that there is but one God and that he is powerful wise and good  Do you believe that all things were created by him and that all beings are dependent on him  Do you rely on his wisdom so conspicuous in his works and in your own frame and are you convinced that he has ordered all things which do not come under the cognizance of your senses in the same perfect harmony to fulfil his designs  Do you acknowledge that the power of looking into futurity and seeing things that are not as if they were is an attribute of the Creator And should he by an impression on the minds of his creatures think fit to impart to them some event hid in the shades of  time yet unborn to whom would the secret be revealed by immediate inspiration The opinion of ages will answer this questionto reverend old men to people distinguished for eminent piety  The oracles of old were thus delivered by priests dedicated to the service of the God who was supposed to inspire them The glare of worldly pomp which surrounded these impostors and the respect paid to them by artful politicians who knew how to avail themselves of this useful engine to bend the necks of the strong under the dominion of the cunning spread a sacred mysterious veil of sanctity over their lies and abominations Impressed by such solemn devotional parade a Greek or Roman lady might be excused if she enquired of the oracle when she was anxious to pry into futurity or inquire about some dubious event and her inquiries however contrary to reason could not be reckoned impiousBut can the professors of Christianity ward off that imputation Can a Christian suppose that the favourites of the most High the highly favoured would be obliged to lurk in disguise and practise the most dishonest  tricks to cheat silly women out of the moneywhich the poor cry for in vain  Say not that such questions are an insult to common sensefor it is your own conduct O ye foolish women which throws an odium on your sex And these reflections should make you shudder at your thoughtlessness and irrational devotionFor I do not suppose that all of you laid aside your religion such as it is when you entered those mysterious dwellings Yet as I have throughout supposed myself talking to ignorant women for ignorant ye are in the most emphatical sense of the word it would be absurd to reason with you on the egregious folly of desiring to know what the Supreme Wisdom has concealed  Probably you would not understand me were I to attempt to shew you that it would be absolutely inconsistent with the grand purpose of life that of rendering human creatures wise and virtuous and that were it sanctioned by God it would disturb the order established in creation and if it be not sanctioned by God do you expect to hear truth Can events be foretold events which have  not yet assumed a body to become subject to mortal inspection can they be foreseen by a vicious worldling who pampers his appetites by preying on the foolish ones  Perhaps however you devoutly believe in the devil and imagine to shift the question that he may assist his votaries but if really respecting the power of such a being an enemy to goodness and to God can you go to church after having been under such an obligation to him  From these delusions to those still more fashionable deceptions practised by the whole tribe of magnetisers the transition is very natural With respect to them it is equally proper to ask women a few questions  Do you know any thing of the construction of the human frame If not it is proper that you should be told what every child ought to know that when its admirable oeconomy has been disturbed by intemperance or indolence I speak not of violent disorders but of chronical diseases it must be brought into a healthy state again by slow degrees and if the functions of life have not been materially injured regimen another word for temperance air exercise and a few medicines  prescribed by persons who have studied the human body are the only human means yet discovered of recovering that inestimable blessing health that will bear investigation  Do you then believe that these magnetisers who by hocus pocus tricks pretend to work a miracle are delegated by God or assisted by the solver of all these kind of difficulties the devil  Do they when they put to flight as it is said disorders that have baffled the powers of medicine work in conformity to the light of reason or do they effect these wonderful cures by supernatural aid  By a communication an adept may answer with the world of spirits A noble privilege it must be allowed Some of the ancients mention familiar daemons who guarded them from danger by kindly intimating we cannot guess in what manner when any danger was nigh or pointed out what they ought to undertake Yet the men who laid claim to this privilege out of the order of nature insisted that it was the reward or consequence of superiour temperance and piety But the present workers of wonders are not raised above their fellows by superiour  temperance or sanctity They do not cure for the love of God but money These are the priests of quackery though it be true they have not the convenient expedient of selling masses for souls in purgatory nor churches where they can display crutches and models of limbs made sound by a touch or a word  I am not conversant with the technical terms nor initiated into the arcana therefore I may speak improperly but it is clear that men who will not conform to the law of reason and earn a subsistence in an honest way by degrees are very fortunate in becoming acquainted with such obliging spirits We cannot indeed give them credit for either great sagacity or goodness else they would have chosen more noble instruments when they wished to shew themselves the benevolent friends of man  It is however little short of blasphemy to pretend to such powers  From the whole tenour of the dispensations of Providence it appears evident to sober reason that certain vices produce certain effects and can any one so grossly insult the wisdom of God as to suppose that a miracle will be allowed to  disturb his general laws to restore to health the intemperate and vicious merely to enable them to pursue the same course with impunity Be whole and sin no more said Jesus And are greater miracles to be performed by those who do not follow his footsteps who healed the body to reach the mind  The mentioning of the name of Christ after such vile impostors may displease some of my readersI respect their warmth but let them not forget that the followers of these delusions bear his name and profess to be the disciples of him who said by their works we should know who were the children of God or the servants of sin I allow that it is easier to touch the body of a saint or to be magnetised than to restrain our appetites or govern our passions but health of body or mind can only be recovered by these means or we make the Supreme Judge partial and revengeful  Is he a man that he should change or punish out of resentment Hethe common father wounds but to heal says reason and our irregularities producing certain consequences we are forcibly shewn the nature of vice that thus learning to know good from  evil by experience we may hate one and love the other in proportion to the wisdom which we attain The poison contains the antidote and we either reform our evil habits and cease to sin against our own bodies to use the forcible language of scripture or a premature death the punishment of sin snaps the thread of life  Here an awful stop is put to our inquiries But why should I conceal my sentiments Considering the attributes of God I believe that whatever punishment may follow will tend like the anguish of disease to shew the malignity of vice for the purpose of reformation Positive punishment appears so contrary to the nature of God discoverable in all his works and in our own reason that I could sooner believe that the Deity paid no attention to the conduct of men than that he punished without the benevolent design of reforming  To suppose only that an allwise and powerful Being as good as he is great should create a being foreseeing that after fifty or sixty years of feverish existence it would be plunged into never ending woeis blasphemy On what will the worm feed that  is never to dieOn folly on ignorance say yeI should blush indignantly at drawing the natural conclusion could I insert it and wish to withdraw myself from the wing of my GodOn such a supposition I speak with reverence he would be a consuming fire We should wish though vainly to fly from his presence when fear absorbed love and darkness involved all his counsels  I know that many devout people boast of submitting to the Will of God blindly as to an arbitrary sceptre or rod on the same principle as the Indians worship the devil In other words like people in the common concerns of life they do homage to power and cringe under the foot that can crush them Rational religion on the contrary is a submission to the will of a being so perfectly wise that all he wills must be directed by the proper motivemust be reasonable  And if thus we respect God can we give credit to the mysterious insi  ations which insult his laws can we believe though it should stare us in the face that he would work a miracle to authorize confusion by sanctioning an error Yet we must either allow these impious conclusions or treat with  contempt every promise to restore health to a diseased body by supernatural means or to foretell the incidents that can only be foreseen by God  SECT II  ANOTHER instance of that feminine weakness of character often produced by a confined education is a romantic twist of the mind which has been very properly termed  sentimental    Women subjected by ignorance to their sensations and only taught to look for happiness in love refine on sensual feelings and adopt metaphysical notions respecting that passion which lead them shamefully to neglect the duties of life and frequently in the midst of these sublime refinements they plump into actual vice  These  women who are amused by the reveries of the stupid novelists who knowing little of human nature work up stale tales and describe meretricious scenes all retailed in a sentimental jargon which equally tend to corrupt the taste and draw the heart aside  from its daily duties I do not mention the understanding because never having been exercised its slumbering energies rest inactive like the lurking particles of fire which are supposed universally to pervade matter  Females in fact denied all political privileges and not allowed as married women excepting in criminal cases a civil existence have their attention naturally drawn from the interest of the whole community to that of the minute parts though the private duty of any member of society must be very imperfectly performed when not connected with the general good The mighty business of female life is to please and restrained from entering into more important concerns by political and civil oppression sentiments become events and reflection deepens what it should and would have effaced if the understanding had been allowed to take a wider range  But confined to trifling employments they naturally imbibe opinions which the only kind of reading calculated to interest an innocent frivolous mind inspires Unable to grasp any thing great is it surprising that they find the reading of history a very dry task and  disquisitions addressed to the understanding intolerably tedious and almost unintelligible Thus are they necessarily dependent on the novelist for amusement Yet when I exclaim against novels I mean when contrasted with those works which exercise the understanding and regulate the imaginationFor any kind of reading I think better than leaving a blank still a blank because the mind must receive a degree of enlargement and obtain a little strength by a slight exertion of its thinking powers besides even the productions that are only addressed to the imagination raise the reader a little above the gross gratification of appetites to which the mind has not given a shade of delicacy  This observation is the result of experience for I have known several notable women and one in particular who was a very good womanas good as such a narrow mind would allow her to be who took care that her daughters three in number should never see a novel As she was a woman of fortune and fashion they had various masters to attend them and a sort of menial governess to watch their footsteps From their masters they learned how tables chairs c were  called in French and Italian but as the few books thrown in their way were far above their capacities or devotional they neither acquired ideas nor sentiments and passed their time when not compelled to repeat  words  in dressing quarrelling with each other or conversing with their maids by stealth till they were brought into company as marriageable  Their mother a widow was busy in the mean time in keeping up her connections as she termed a numerous acquaintance lest her girls should want a proper introduction into the great world And these young ladies with minds vulgar in every sense of the word and spoiled tempers entered life puffed up with notions of their own consequence and looking down with contempt on those who could not vie with them in dress and parade  With respect to love nature or their nurses had taken care to teach them the physical meaning of the word and as they had few topics of conversation and fewer refinements of sentiment they expressed their gross wishes not in very delicate phrases when they spoke freely talking of matrimony  Could these girls have been injured by the perusal of novels I almost forgot a shade in the character of one of them she affected a simplicity bordering on folly and with a simper would utter the most immodest remarks and questions the full meaning of which she had learned whilst secluded from the world and afraid to speak in her mother's presence who governed with a high hand they were all educated as she prided herself in a most exemplary manner and read their chapters and psalms before breakfast never touching a silly novel  This is only one instance but I recollect many other women who not led by degrees to proper studies and not permitted to choose for themselves have indeed been overgrown children or have obtained by mixing in the world a little of what is termed common sense that is a distinct manner of seeing common occurrences as they stand detached but what deserves the name of intellect the power of gaining general or abstract ideas or even intermediate ones was out of the question Their minds were quiescent and when they were not roused by sensible objects  and employments of that kind they were lowspirited would cry or go to sleep  When therefore I advise my sex not to read such flimsy works it is to induce them to read something superiour for I coincide in opinion with a sagacious man who having a daughter and niece under his care pursued a very different plan with each  The niece who had considerable abilities had before she was left to his guardianship been indulged in desultory reading Her he endeavoured to lead and did lead to history and moral essays but his daughter whom a fond weak mother had indulged and who consequently was averse to every thing like application he allowed to read novels and used to justify his conduct by saying that if she ever attained a relish for reading them he should have some foundation to work upon and that erroneous opinions were better than none at all  In fact the female mind has been so totally neglected that knowledge was only to be acquired from this muddy source till from reading novels some women of superiour talents learned to despise them  The best method I believe that can be adopted to correct a fondness for novels is to ridicule them not indiscriminately for then it would have little effect but if a judicious person with some turn for humour would read several to a young girl and point out both by tones and apt comparisons with pathetic incidents and heroic characters in history how foolishly and ridiculously they caricatured human nature just opinions might be substituted instead of romantic sentiments  In one respect however the majority of both sexes resemble and equally shew a want of taste and modesty Ignorant women forced to be chaste to preserve their reputation allow their imagination to revel in the unnatural and meretricious scenes sketched by the novel writers of the day slighting as insipid the sober dignity and matronly graces of history  I am not now alluding to that superiority of mind which leads to the creation of ideal beauty when life surveyed with a penetrating eye appears a tragicomedy in which little can be seen to satisfy the heart without the help of fancy  whilst men carry the same vitiated taste into life and fly for amusement to the wanton from the unsophisticated charms  of virtue and the grave respectability of sense  Besides the reading of novels makes women and particularly ladies of fashion very fond of using strong expressions and superlatives in conversation and though the dissipated artificial life which they lead prevents their cherishing any strong legitimate passion the language of passion in affected tones slips for ever from their glib tongues and every trifle produces those phosphoric bursts which only mimick in the dark the flame of passion  SECT III  IGNORANCE and the mistaken cunning that nature sharpens in weak heads as a principle of selfpreservation render women very fond of dress and produce all the vanity which such a fondness may naturally be expected to generate to the exclusion of emulation and magnanimity  I agree with Rousseau that the physical part of the art of pleasing consists in ornaments and for that very reason I should guard girls against the contagious fondness for dress so  common to weak women that they may not rest in the physical part Yet weak are the women who imagine that they can long please without the aid of the mind or in other words without the moral art of pleasing But the moral art if it be not a profanation to use the word art when alluding to the grace which is an effect of virtue and not the motive of action is never to be found with ignorance the sportiveness of innocence so pleasing to refined libertines of both sexes is widely different in its essence from this superiour gracefulness  A strong inclination for external ornaments ever appears in barbarous states only the men not the women adorn themselves for where women are allowed to be so far on a level with men society has advanced at least one step in civilization  The attention to dress therefore which has been thought a sexual propensity I think natural to mankind But I ought to express myself with more precision When the mind is not sufficiently opened to take pleasure in reflection the body will be adorned with sedulous care and ambition will appear in tattooing or painting it  So far is this first inclination carried that even the hellish yoke of slavery cannot stifle the savage desire of admiration which the black heroes inherit from both their parents for all the hardly earned savings of a slave are commonly expended in a little tawdry finery And I have seldom known a good male or female servant that was not particularly fond of dress Their clothes were their riches and I argue from analogy that the fondness for dress so extravagant in females arises from the same causewant of cultivation of mind When men meet they converse about business politics or literature but says Swift  how naturally do women apply their hands to each others lappets and ruffles  And very natural is itfor they have not any business to interest them have not a taste for literature and they find politics dry because they have not acquired a love for mankind by turning their thoughts to the grand pursuits that exalt the human race and promote general happiness  Besides various are the paths to power and fame which by accident or choice men pursue and though they jostle against each other for men of the same profession are seldom  friends yet there is a much greater number of their fellowcreatures with whom they never clash But women are very differently situated with respect to each otherfor they are all rivals  Before marriage it is their business to please men and after with a few exceptions they follow the same scent with all the persevering pertinacity of instinct Even virtuous women never forget their sex in company for they are for ever trying to make themselves  agreeable  A female beauty and a male wit appear to be equally anxious to draw the attention of the company to themselves and the animosity of contemporary wits is proverbial  Is it then surprising that when the sole ambition of woman centres in beauty and interest gives vanity additional force perpetual rivalships should ensue They are all running the same race and would rise above the virtue of mortals if they did not view each other with a suspicious and even envious eye  An immoderate fondness for dress for pleasure and for sway are the passions of savages the passions that occupy those uncivilized beings who have not yet extended the dominion  of the mind or even learned to think with the energy necessary to concatenate that abstract train of thought which produces principles And that women from their education and the present state of civilized life are in the same condition cannot I think be controverted To laugh at them then or satirize the follies of a being who is never to be allowed to act freely from the light of her own reason is as absurd as cruel for that they who are taught blindly to obey authority will endeavour cunningly to elude it is most natural and certain  Yet let it be proved that they ought to obey man implicitly and I shall immediately agree that it is woman's duty to cultivate a fondness for dress in order to please and a propensity to cunning for her own preservation  The virtues however which are supported by ignorance must ever be waveringthe house built on sand could not endure a storm It is almost unnecessary to draw the inference If women are to be made virtuous by authority which is a contradiction in terms let them be immured in seraglios and watched with a jealous eyeFear not that the iron will enter into their soulsfor the souls that  can bear such treatment are made of yielding materials just animated enough to give life to the body  'Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear  'And best distinguish'd by black brown or fair'  The most cruel wounds will of course soon heal and they may still people the world and dress to please manall the purposes which certain celebrated writers have allowed that they were created to fulfil  SECT IV  WOMEN are supposed to possess more sensibility and even humanity than men and their strong attachments and instantaneous emotions of compassion are given as proofs but the clinging affection of ignorance has seldom any thing noble in it and may mostly be resolved into selfishness as well as the affection of children and brutes I have known many weak women whose sensibility was entirely engrossed by their husbands and as for their humanity it was very faint indeed or rather it was only a transient emotion of compassion Humanity does not consist 'in a squeamish ear' says an eminent  orator  It belongs to the mind as well as the nerves  But this kind of exclusive affection though it degrades the individual should not be brought forward as a proof of the inferiority of the sex because it is the natural consequence of confined views for even women of superior sense having their attention turned to little employments and private plans rarely rise to heroism unless when spurred on by love and love as an heroic passion like genius appears but once in an age I therefore agree with the moralist who asserts  that women have seldom so much generosity as men  and that their narrow affections to which justice and humanity are often sacrificed render the sex apparently inferior especially as they are commonly inspired by men but I contend that the heart would expand as the understanding gained strength if women were not depressed from their cradles  I know that a little sensibility and great weakness will produce a strong sexual attachment and that reason must cement friendship consequently I allow that more friendship is to be found in the male than the female  world and that men have a higher sense of justice The exclusive affections of women seem indeed to resemble Cato's most unjust love for his country He wished to crush Carthage not to save Rome but to promote its vainglory and in general it is to similar principles that humanity is sacrificed for genuine duties support each other  Besides how can women be just or generous when they are the slaves of injustice  SECT V  As the rearing of children that is the laying a foundation of sound health both of body and mind in the rising generation has justly been insisted on as the peculiar destination of woman the ignorance that incapacitates them must be contrary to the order of things And I contend that their minds can take in much more and ought to do so or they will never become sensible mothers Many men attend to the breeding of horses and overlook the management of the stable who would strange want of sense and feeling think themselves degraded by paying  any attention to the nursery yet how many children are absolutely murdered by the ignorance of women But when they escape and are neither destroyed by unnatural negligence nor blind fondness how few are managed properly with respect to the infant mind So that to break the spirit allowed to become vicious at home a child is sent to school and the methods taken there which must be taken to keep a number of children in order scatter the seeds of almost every vice in the soil thus forcibly torn up  I have sometimes compared the struggles of these poor children who ought never to have felt restraint nor would had they been always held in with an even hand to the despairing plunges of a spirited filly which I have seen breaking on a strand its feet sinking deeper and deeper in the sand every time it endeavoured to throw its rider till at last it sullenly submitted  I have always found horses an animal I am attached to very tractable when treated with humanity and steadiness so that I doubt whether the violent methods taken to break them do not essentially injure them I am however certain that a child should never be  thus forcibly tamed after it has injudiciously been allowed to run wild for every violation of justice and reason in the treatment of children weakens their reason And so early do they catch a character that the base of the moral character experience leads me to infer is fixed before their seventh year the period during which women are allowed the sole management of children Afterwards it too often happens that half the business of education is to correct and very imperfectly is it done if done hastily the faults which they would never have acquired if their mothers had had more understanding  One striking instance of the folly of women must not be omittedThe manner in which they treat servants in the presence of children permitting them to suppose that they ought to wait on them and bear their humours A child should always be made to receive assistance from a man or woman as a favour and as the first lesson of independence they should practically be taught by the example of their mother not to require that personal attendance which it is an insult to humanity to require when in health and instead of being led to assume airs of consequence  a sense of their own weakness should first make them feel the natural equality of man Yet how frequently have I indignantly heard servants imperiously called to put children to bed and sent away again and again because master or miss hung about mamma to stay a little longer Thus made slavishly to attend the little idol all those most disgusting humours were exhibited which characterize a spoiled child  In short speaking of the majority of mothers they leave their children entirely to the care of servants or because they are their children treat them as if they were little demigods though I have always observed that the women who thus idolize their children seldom shew common humanity to servants or feel the least tenderness for any children but their own  It is however these exclusive affections and an individual manner of seeing things produced by ignorance which keep women for ever at a stand with respect to improvement and make many of them dedicate their lives to their children only to weaken their bodies and spoil their tempers frustrating also any plan of education that a more  rational father may adopt for unless a mother concurs the father who restrains will ever be considered as a tyrant  But fulfilling the duties of a mother a woman with a sound constitution may still keep her person scrupulously neat and assist to maintain her family if necessary or by reading and conversations with both sexes indiscriminately improve her mind For nature has so wisely ordered things that did women suckle their children they would preserve their own health and there would be such an interval between the birth of each child that we should seldom see a houseful of babes And did they pursue a plan of conduct and not waste their time in following the fashionable vagaries of dress the management of their household and children need not shut them out from literature nor prevent their attaching themselves to a science with that steady eye which strengthens the mind or practising one of the fine arts that cultivate the taste  But visiting to display finery cardplaying and balls not to mention the idle bustle of morning trifling draw women from their duty to render them insignificant to render them pleasing according to the present acceptation  of the word to every man but their husband For a round of pleasures in which the affections are not exercised cannot be said to improve the understanding though it be erroneously called seeing the world yet the heart is rendered cold and averse to duty by such a senseless intercourse which becomes necessary from habit even when it has ceased to amuse  But till more equality be established in society till ranks are confounded and women freed we shall not see that dignified domestic happiness the simple grandeur of which cannot be relished by ignorant or vitiated minds nor will the important task of education ever be properly begun till the person of a woman is no longer preferred to her mind For it would be as wise to expect corn from tares or figs from thistles as that a foolish ignorant woman should be a good mother  SECT VI  It is not necessary to inform the sagacious reader now I enter on my concluding reflections that the discussion of this subject merely consists in opening a few simple principles and  clearing away the rubbish which obscured them But as all readers are not sagacious I must be allowed to add some explanatory remarks to bring the subject home to reason to that sluggish reason which supinely takes opinions on trust and obstinately supports them to spare itself the labour of thinking  Moralists have unanimously agreed that unless virtue be nursed by liberty it will never attain due strengthand what they say of man I extend to mankind insisting that in all cases morals must be fixed on immutable principles and that the being cannot be termed rational or virtuous who obeys any authority but that of reason  To render women truly useful members of society I argue that they should be led by having their understandings cultivated on a large scale to acquire a rational affection for their country founded on knowledge because it is obvious that we are little interested about what we do not understand And to render this general knowledge of due importance I have endeavoured to shew that private duties are never properly fulfilled unless the understanding enlarges the heart and that public virtue is only an aggregate of private But the distinctions established in  society undermines both by beating out the solid gold of virtue till it becomes only the tinselcovering of vice for whilst wealth renders a man more respectable than virtue wealth will be sought before virtue and whilst women's persons are caressed when a childish simper shews an absence of mind the mind will lie fallow Yet true voluptuousness must proceed from the mindfor what can equal the sensations produced by mutual affection supported by mutual respect What are the cold or feverish caresses of appetite but sin embracing death compared with the modest overflowings of a pure heart and exalted imagination Yes let me tell the libertine of fancy when he despises understanding in womanthat the mind which he disregards gives life to the enthusiastic affection from which rapture shortlived as it is alone can flow And that without virtue a sexual attachment must expire like a tallow candle in the socket create+ing intolerable disgust To prove this I need only observe that men who have wasted great part of their lives with women and with whom they have sought for pleasure with eager thirst entertain the meanest opinion of the sexVirtue true refiner of joy  if foolish men were to fright thee from earth in order to give loose to all their appetites without a checksome sensual wight of taste would scale the heavens to invite thee back to give a zest to pleasure  That women at present are by ignorance rendered foolish or vicious is I think not to be disputed and that the most salutary effects tending to improve mankind might be expected from a REVOLUTION in female manners appears at least with a face of probability to rise out of the observation For as marriage has been termed the parent of those endearing charities which draw man from the brutal herd the corrupting intercourse that wealth idleness and folly produce between the sexes is more universally injurious to morality than all the other vices of mankind collectively considered To adulterous lust the most sacred duties are sacrificed because before marriage men by a promiscuous intimacy with women learned to consider love as a selfish gratification learned to separate it not only from esteem but from the affection merely built on habit which mixes a little humanity with it Justice and friendship are also set at defiance and that purity of taste is vitiated which  would naturally lead a man to relish an artless display of affection rather than affected airs But that noble simplicity of affection which dares to appear unadorned has few attractions for the libertine though it be the charm which by cementing the matrimonial tie secures to the pledges of a warmer passion the necessary parental attention for children will never be properly educated till friendship subsists between parents Virtue flies from a house divided against itselfand a whole legion of devils take up their residence there  The affection of husbands and wives cannot be pure when they have so few sentiments in common and when so little confidence is established at home as must be the case when their pursuits are so different That intimacy from which tenderness should flow will not cannot subsist between the vicious  Contending therefore that the sexual distinction which men have so warmly insisted upon is arbitrary I have dwelt on an observation that several sensible men with whom I have conversed on the subject allowed to be well founded and it is simply this that the little chastity to be found amongst men and consequent disregard of modesty tend to degrade  both sexes and further that the modesty of women characterized as such will often be only the artful veil of wantonness instead of being the natural reflection of purity till modesty be universally respected  From the tyranny of man I firmly believe the greater number of female follies proceed and the cunning which I allow makes at present a part of their character I likewise have repeatedly endeavoured to prove is produced by oppression  Were not dissenters for instance a class of people with strict truth characterized as cunning And may I not lay some stress on this fact to prove that when any power but reason curbs the free spirit of man dissimulation is practised and the various shifts of art are naturally called forth Great attention to decorum which was carried to a degree of scrupulosity and all that puerile bustle about trifles and consequential solemnity which Butler's caricature of a dissenter brings before the imagination shaped their persons as well as their minds in the mould of prim littleness I speak collectively for I know how many ornaments to human nature have been enrolled amongst sectaries yet I assert that the same narrow prejudice for their sect which  women have for their families prevailed in the dissenting part of the community however worthy in other respects and also that the same timid prudence or headstrong efforts often disgraced the exertions of both Oppression thus formed many of the features of their character perfectly to coincide with that of the oppressed half of mankind for is it not notorious that dissenters were like women fond of deliberating together and asking advice of each other till by a complication of little contrivances some little end was brought about A similar attention to preserve their reputation was conspicuous in the dissenting and female world and was produced by a similar cause  Asserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for I have not attempted to extenuate their faults but to prove them to be the natural consequence of their education and station in society If so it is reasonable to suppose that they will change their character and correct their vices and follies when they are allowed to be free in a physical moral and civil sense  I had further enlarged on the advantages which might reasonably be expected to result from an improvement in female manners towards the general reformation of society but it appeared to me that such reflections would more properly close the last volume    Let woman share the rights and she will emulate the virtues of man for she must grow more perfect when emancipated or justify the authority that chains such a weak being to her dutyIf the latter it will be expedient to open a fresh trade with Russia for whips a present which a father should always make to his soninlaw on his wedding day that a husband may keep his whole family in order by the same means and without any violation of justice reign wielding this sceptre sole master of his house because he is the only being in it who has reasonthe divine indefeasible earthly sovereignty breathed into man by the Master of the universe Allowing this position women have not any inherent rights to claim and by the same rule their duties vanish for rights and duties are inseparable  Be just then O ye men of understanding and mark not more severely what women do amiss than the vicious tricks of  the horse or the ass for whom ye provide provenderand allow her the privileges of ignorance to whom ye deny the rights of reason or ye will be worse than Egyptian taskmasters expecting virtue where nature has not given understanding  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
