 ORIGINAL LETTERS OF THE LATE REVEREND Mr LAURENCE STERNE  ORIGINAL LETTERS OF THE LATE REVEREND MR LAURENCE STERNE NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED  LONDON  Printed at the  Logographic Press  AND SOLD BY T LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW J ROBSON AND W CLARKE NEW BOND STREET AND W RICHARDSON UNDER THE ROYAL EXCHANGE  LETTERS OF THE LATE Mr LAURENCE STERNE  To W C Esq  Coxwould  July  I Am safe arrived at my bowerand I trust that you have no longer any doubt about coming to embower it with me Having for six months together been running at the ring of pleasure you will find that repose here which all young  as you are you ought to want We will be witty or classical or sentimental as it shall please you best My milkmaids shall weave you garlands and every day after coffee I will take you to pay a visit to my nuns Do not however indulge your fancy beyond measure but rather let me indulge mine or at least let me give you the history of it and the fair sisterhood who dwell in one of it's visionary corners Now what is all this about you'll sayhave a few moments patience and I will tell you  You must know then that on passing out of my back door I very soon gain a path which after conducting me through several verdant meadows and shady thickets brings me in about twenty minutes to the ruins of a monastery where in  times long past a certain number of cloistered females had devoted theirlivesI scarce know what I was going to writeto religious solitudeThis saunter of mine when I take it I call  paying a visit to my nuns  It is an awful spota rivulet flows by it and a lofty bank covered with wood that rises abruptly on the opposite side gives a gloom to the whole and forbids the thoughts if they were ever so disposed from wandering away from the place Solitary sanctity never found a nook more appropriated to her natureIt is a place for an antiquary to sojourn in for a monthand examine with all the spirit of rusty research But I am no antiquary as you well knowand therefore I come  here upon a different and a better errandthat isto examine myself  So I lean lackadaysically over a gate and look at the passing streamand forgive the spleen the gout and the envy of a malicious world And after having taken a stroll beneath mouldering arches I summon the sisterhood together and take the fairest among them and sit down with her on a stone beneath a bunch of aldersand dowhat you'll saywhy I examine her gentle heart and see how it is attuned I then guess at her wishes and play with the cross that hangs at her bosomin shortI make love to her  Fie for shame Tristramthat is not as it ought to beNow I declare on the contrary that it is exactly what it  ought to be for though philosophers may say among the many other foolish things philosophers have said that a man who is in love is not in his right sensesI do assert in opposition to all their saws and seesaws that he is never in his right senses or I would rather say his right sentiments but when he is pursuing some  Dulcinea  or other If that should be the case with you at this moment I will forgive your staying from me but if this letter should find you at the instant when your last flame is blown out and before a new one is lighted up and you should not take post and come to me and my nuns I will abuse you in their name and my own to the end of the chapterthough I believe after all at the end of the chapter I should feel myself  affectionately your's L STERNE  LETTER II  Coxwould  July  AND so you have been at the seats of the learnedIf I could have guessed at such an intention I would have contrived that something in an epistolary shape should have met you there with half a dozen lines recommending you to the care of the  Master of Jesus  He was my tutor when I was at College and a very good kind of man He used to let me have my way when I was under his direction and that shewed his sense for I was born to  travel out of the common road and to get aside from the highway path and he had sense enough to see it and not to trouble me with trammels I was neither made to be a  thillhorse  nor a  forehorse  in short I was not made to go in a  team  but to amble along as I liked and so that I do not kick or splash or run over any one who in the name of common sense has a right to interrupt meLet the good folks laugh if they will and much good may it do them Indeed I am persuaded and I think I could prove nay and I would do it if I were writing a book instead of a letter the truth of what I once told a very great statesman orator politician and as much more as you please  that every time a man smilesmuch more sowhen he laughsit adds something to the fragment of life  But the staying five days at Cambridge does not come within the immediate reach of my crazy comprehension and you might have employed your time much much better in urging your mettlesome tits to wards Coxwould  I may suppose that you have been picking a hole in the skirts of Gibb's cumbrous architecture or measuring the fa√ßade of Trinity College Library or peering about the gothic perfections of King's College Chapel or which was doing a better thing sipping tea and talking sentimentally with the Miss Cookes or disturbing Mr Gray with one of your enthusiastic visitsI say  disturbing  him for with all your own agreeableness and all your admiration of him he would rather have your room than your company But mark  me I do not say this to his glory but to his shame For I would be content with any room so I had your company  But tell me I beseech you what you did with  S  all this time The looking at the heavy walls of muzzing Colleges and gazing at the mouldy pictures of their founders is not altogether in his way nor did he wander where I have whilom wandered on Cam's all verdant banks with willows crowned and call the muse Alas he'd rather call a waiterand how such a milksop as you could travelI mean be suffered to travel two leagues in the same chaise with him I know notbut from that admirable and kind pliability of spirit which you possess whenever you please but which you do not always please to possess I do not mean  that a man should wear a court dress when he is going to a puppetshow but on the other hand to keep the best suit of embroidery for those only whom he loves though there is something noble in it will never do The world my dear friend will not let it do For while there are such qualities in the human mind as ingratitude and duplicity unlimited confidence and this patriotism of friendship which I have heard you rave and rant about is a very dangerous business  I could preach a sermon on the subjectto say the truth I am got as grave as if I were in my pulpit Thus are the projects of this life destroyed When I took up my pen my humour was gay frisky and fancifuland now I am sliding into all the seesaw gravity of solemn councils  I want nothing but an ass to look over my pales and set up a braying to keep me in countenance  Leave leave your Lincolnshire seats and come to my dale S I know is heartily tired of you Besides I want a nurse for I am not quite well and have taken to milkcoffee Remember me however to him kindly and to yourself cordially for  I am yours most truly L STERNE  LETTER III To W C Esq  Coxwould  Aug  AND so you sit in S's temple and drink tea and converse classicallynow I should like to know what is the nature of this disorder which you call classicalityif it consists in a rage to converse on ancient subjects in a modern manner or on modern subjects in an antient oneor are you both out of your senses and do you fancy yourselves with Virgil and Horace at Sinuessa or with Tully and Atticus at Tusculum Oh how it would delight  me to peep at you from behind a laurel bush and see you surrounded with columns and covered by a dome quaffing the extract of a Chinese weed and talking of men who boasted the inspiration of the Falernian grape  What a couple of vapid inert beings you must beI should really give you up for lost if it were not for the confidence I have in the reinvigorating powers of my society to which you must now have immediate recourse if you wish for a restoration Make haste then my good friend and seek the aid of your physician ere it be too late  You know not the interest I take in your welfare Have I not ordered all the linen to be taken out of the press and rewashed  before it was dirty that you may have a clean table cloth every day with a napkin into the bargain And have I not ordered a kind of windmill that makes my head ach again with its clatter to be placed in my fine cherrytree that the fruit may be preserved from the birds to furnish you a desert And do you not know that you will have curds and cream for your supper Think on these things and let S go to Lincoln sessions by himself and talk classically with country justices In the mean time we will philosophize and sentimentalizethe last word is a bright invention of the moment in which it was written for yours or Dr Johnson's serviceand you shall sit in my study and take a peep into the world as into a showbox and amuse yourself as I present the pictures of it to your imagination  Thus will I teach you to laugh at its follies to pity its errors and despise its injusticeand I will introduce you among the rest to some tenderhearted damsel on whose cheeks some bitter affliction has placed a tearand having heard her story you shall take a white handkerchief from your pocket to wipe the moisture from her eyes and from your ownand then you shall go to bed not to the damsel but with an heart conscious of those sentiments and possessed of those feelings which will give softness to your pillow sweetness to your slumbers and gladness to your waking moments  You shall sit in my porch and laugh at attic vestibules I love the classics as well as any man ought to love thembut among all their fine sayings their fine writings  and their fine verses their most enthusiastic admirer would not be able to find me half a dozen stories that have any sentiment in themand so much for that  If you don't come soon I shall set about another volume of Tristram without you So God bless you for  I am your's most truly L STERNE  LETTER IV To  Coxwould near Easingwould  August  I AM grieved for your downfall though it was only out of a parkchairMay it be the last you will receive in this world though while I write this wish my heart heaves a deep sigh and I believe it will not be read by you my friend without a similar accompaniment  Alas alas my dear boy you are born with talents to soar aloft with but you have an heart which my apprehensions  tell me will keep you lowI do not mean you know I do not any thing base or grovellingbut instead of winging your way above the storm I am afraid that you will calmly submit to its rigours and house yourself afterwards in some humble shed and there live contented and chaunt away the time and be lost to the world  How the wind blows I know not and I have not an inclination to walk to my window where perhaps I might catch the course of a cloud and be satisfiedbut here I am up to my kneesI should rather say up to my heart in a subject which is ever accompanied with some afflicting vaticination or other I am not afraid of your doing any wrong but to yourself A secret knowledge of some  circumstances which you have never communicated to me have alarmed my affection for younot from any immediate harm they can produce but from the conviction they have forced upon me concerning your disposition and the nicer parts of your character If you do not come soon to me I shall take the wings of some fine morning and fly to you but I should rather have you here for I wish to have you alone and if you will let me be a  Mentor  to you for one little month I will be contentand you shall be a  Mentor  to me the rest of the year or if you will the rest of my days  I long most anxiously my dear friend to teach younot to give an opiate to those sensibilities of your nature which make me love you as I do nor to check  your glowing fancy that gives such grace to polish'd youth nor to yield the beverage of the fountain for the nectar of the cask but to use the world no better or to please you a very little better than it deservesBut think not I beseech you that I would introduce my young  Telemachus  to such a foul and squinteyed piece of pollution as Suspicion Avaunt to such a base ungenerous passion I would sooner carry you to  Calypso  at once and give you at least a little pleasure for your pains But there is a certain little spot to be found somewhere in the midway between trusting every body and trusting nobody and so well am I acquainted with the longitudes latitudes and bearings of this world of ours that I could put my finger upon it and direct you at once to it and I think I could give you so many good  reasons why you should go there that you would not hesitate to set off immediately and I would accompany you thither and serve as a  Cicerone  to you I wish therefore much very much to talk with you about that and other serious matters  As for your bodily infirmity never mind it you may come here by gentle stages and without inconvenience and I will be your surgeon or your nurse and warm your verjuice every evening and bathe your sprain with it and talk of these things So tell me I pray you the day that I am to meet you at York In the mean time and always may a good Providence protect youIt is the sincere wish of  Your affectionate L STERNE  LETTER V To W C Esq  Wednesday Morning  THIS letter will meet you at Hewit's instead of myself for I have taken some how or other and I know not how a very violent cold and cannot come and as I would receive you with my best looks if possible as well as my best welcome I am nursing myself into some sort of restoration against your arrival though my cough torments me without mercy and I am so hoarse at this moment that I can scarce make myself heard across my table  This phthisic of mine will sooner or later and perhaps sooner than either I or you my friend may think bear me to my last asylum from a splenetic world You will say perhaps that I am splenetic also in my turn by writing thus  gravely  but as I well know this vile cough is the engine which that scarecrow death employs to shatter my poor frame and bring it to his dominion how can I be merry or satisfiedIt is true I love laughing and merrymaking and all that as well as any soul upon earth nevertheless I cannot think of piping and taboring it out of the world like the figures in  Holbein's dance  Besides I have been so used to my own way that I don't like to be put out of it by being made to cough so villainously as I do more than half my time It is most inurbane in himby Heaven it is cowardly  in the rascal to rob me of those spirits with which I have so often defeated him  And this is not allfor I have forty volumes more to write nay and have absolutely promised the world to do it and I have my engagements to you as well as to the worldand to myself as well as to you both and how shall I keep my word as an author and a gentleman and what is of more consequence than eitheras a friendif I cannot shake off this piece of anatomy Besides no one can do these things for me but myself the business is beyond all power of attorney for if I were to leave fifty executors to my last will and testament and if they were to be joined by a regiment of administrators and assigns  they could not take up their pens and do as I would do  But what a wayward fancy mine isand with what a seducing pen am I writingfor I am got leagues without number from the idea which danced before me when I first began this letter And here I am wrong againfor what great distance can there be between the grave of my grandfather and my own and it was to his tomb that I wished to conduct you  I know full well that all sprained your ancle may be it will be wholly impossible for you to pass through York without popping your head into its cathedral and indulging your mind with a few of those reflections which such a building is calculated to inspire Now when you  are there tell a verger to conduct you to the tomb of Archbishop Sterne He is the same whose picture you saw at Cambridge and which you were pleased to say bore so strong a resemblance to me In the marble whole length figure which dignifies the monument you will find the likeness still stronger and if I drop in this corner of the world I should like to be deposited in that corner of the church and sleep out my last sleep beside my pious ancestor  He was an excellent prelate and an honest manI have not half his virtues if report speaks true of us both which for his sake I hope it doesand for my own I hope it does not Though to use an expression which dropped from the lips and at the table of a brother  Arch  prelate  of his and one of his successors "My ideas are sometimes rather too  disorderly  for a man  in orders  " In his Grace's  Concio ad clerum  I do not find myself a very principal figure but in his private hours he is always most cordial to me  The day after tomorrow I shall hope to embrace you at my gate till then my dear friend may God bless youand always  Your's most affectionately L STERNE  LETTER VI To  Coxwould  Monday Morning  I SHALL forgive the tardiness of your passage hither if it be true as a still small voice of a York gossip has informed me that you repose with your infirm limb on a sofa in Mrs 's withdrawing room and have your coffee and tea handed you by her two daughters and one of them has charms enough for the three Gracesand that they play on their harpsichord and with voices stolen from heaven sing duets to you while you stretched on damask  command as it were that little world of beauty and good sense which surrounds you  You cannot my good friend have known the charming people with whom you are so happy more than eight and forty hours at most Now I make this observation merely to have the pleasure of making another which is that you have learned the art and a very comfortable one it is of setting yourself at ease with worthy spirits when you have the good fortune to meet them Indeed I may claim the credit of having taught you the maxim that life is too short to be long in forming the tender and happy connections of it 'Tis a miserable waste of time as well as a very base business to be looking at each other as an usurer looks at a security  to find a flaw in it Noif you meet a heart worth being admitted into and you really feel yourself worthy of admission the matter is arranged in five hours as well as five years  Hail ye gentle sympathies that can approach two amiable hearts to each other and chase every discordant idea from an union that nature has designed by the same happy colouring of character that she has given themBut  lucus a non lucendo  I have received a kind of  dish dash  sort of letter from Garrickout of which all my chemistry cannot extract a sympathetic atom I am glad however to have an opportunity of writing a short answer to him that I may address a long postscript to his  cara sposa  I love Garrick on the stage better than any thing in the world  except Mrs Garrick off it  and if there is any one heart in the world I should like to get a corner ofit would be hers But I am too great a sinner to do more than approach the portal of so much excellencethere to bend one knee at least and ejaculate at a distance from the altar  I have often thought on what this spirit of idolatry which is continually bearing me to the feet of some fair image or other will do with me twenty years hence and whether after having had during my younger days a damsel to smooth my pillowI should find one in my age to put on my slipper However I need not trouble myself or you about these conjectures  for I well know there is not life in me to make the experiment  This instant brings me a letter from your kind hostess who is determined not to let you go till I come to fetch youTomorrow by noon therefore I shall embrace you and herandthe damsels  I am most cordially yours L STERNE  LETTTER VII To Esq  Crazy Castle  THOUGH I hope and trust you believe that I am not only disposed to laugh with those who laugh but to weep with those who weepyet it is most true my dear friend that I could not but smile as I read the account you sent me of your distress and disappointment and when I gave your letter to  Hall  for you see I am at  Crazy Castle  he laughed the tears into his eyes  Now you must not suppose nor can you imagine that either of us trifled with your sufferings for you know I love you and  Hall  says you are a lad of promise but we were merry at the amiable simplicity of your nature in wondering that there is ever any villainy in a villainous world and at the idea how little a time you were destined to possess that deliciousfor I will call it with all its scrapes and duperies a delicious sentiment You have just opened the volume of life and startle to find a blot in the first page alas alas as you proceed you will find whole pages so blotted and blurred that you will scarce be able to distinguish the characters 'Tis a sorry business I must confess to plant suspicion in a breast that has never known it and to check the glow of hope which animates the beginning of the journey by pointing out  the interruptions and dangers that will be necessarily encountered in the course of it But this is the duty of friendship and arises from the nature of our existence and the state of the world If however after all you can acquire an useful experience and be taught to put yourself on your guard at the expence of a few score guineas you have made a good bargainso be content and no more of your complainings  But you will tell me perhaps that it is not the matter of the loss but the manner of it that you consider as a misfortune The being treated so ill and with so much ingratitude is the business that afflicts you  Hall  who is still laughing bids me tell you for your comfort that he who  dupes  must be a  rascal  and he who is duped  may be an  honest man  but he is a  cynic  and administers his dose in his own way Now was I to console you in mine I should tell you that gratitude is not so common a virtue in the world as it ought to be for all our sakes but ingratitude my dear friend is not an offspring of the present moment it seems to have existed from the beginning and will continue to disgrace the world when we have long been in the valley of Jehosaphatnay you must have readindeed I know that I have written a sermon upon the subjectthat of the lepers who were healed but  one  returned to give thanks for his restoration I do not however tell you these things that you may find consolation in the miserable habits of mankind but that you may not suppose yourself worse used than the rest of the world which is very common with  young men like yourself who feel at every pore and have not yet had that collision with untoward circumstances which awakens caution or begets patience  And so much for you and your miseries which I doubt not will have been dissipated by the bewitching smiles of some fair damsel or other before my grave seesaw letter shall reach you Let me know I beg of you your plan of operations for the winter if you have one You may I thinkthough you may think otherwisefly from the joys and damps of this ungenial climate and winter serenely with me in Languedoc your company would do me good and mine would do you no harmat least I think so and we shall return to London time enough to peep in at Ranelagh and look at the birthday In  short write to me upon the subject and direct to me here for here I am to be during this shooting month of September so God bless you and give you patience if you want it  I remain Yours most cordially L STERNE  LETTER VIII To W C Esq  Coxwould  June  SO  Burton  The late amiable and excellent Lord Cunningham  really told you with a grave face and an apparent mortification that I had ridiculed my Irish friends at Bath for an hour together and had made a large company merry at  Lady Lepel's  The late Lady Mulgrave  table during an whole afternoon at their expence By Heaven's 'tis false as misrepresentation can make it It is not in my nature I trust to be so ungrateful as I should be if absent or present I were to  be ungracious to them That I should make  Burton  look grave whose countenance is formed to mark the smiles of an amiable and an honest heart is not within my chapter of possibilitiesI am sure it is not in that of my intentions to say any thing that is inurbane of such a man as he isfor in my life did I never communicate with a gentleman of qualities more winning and dispositions more generous He invited me to his house with kindness and he gave me a truly graceful welcome for it was with all his heart He is as much formed to make society pleasant as any one I ever saw and I wish he were as rich as Croesus that he might do all the good an unbounded generosity would lead him to do I never passed more pleasant hours in my life than with him and his fair  countrywomen and foul befall the man who should let drop a word in dispraise of him or themAnd there is the charming widow  Moor  where if I had not a piece of legal meadow of my own I should rejoice to batten the rest of my daysand the gentle elegant  Gore  with her fine form and Grecian face and whose lot I trust it will be to make some man happy who knows the value of a tender heartNor shall I forget another widow the interesting Mrs Vesey with her vocal and fifty other accomplishmentsI abuse themit must not be toldfor it is falseand it should not be believed for it is unnaturalIt is true I did talk of them for an hour together but no sarcasm or unlucky sallies mingled with my speechYes I did talk of them as they would  wish to be talked ofwith smiles on my countenance praise on my tongue hilarity in my heart and the goblet in my handBesides I am myself of their own countryMy father was a considerable time on duty with his regiment in Ireland and my mother gave me to the world when she was there on duty with him I beg of you therefore to make all these good people believe that I have been at least misunderstood for it is impossible that  Lady Barrymore  could mean to misrepresent me  Read  Burton  this letter if you have an opportunity and assure him of my most cordial esteem and respect for him and all his social excellencies and whisper something kind and gentle for me as you well  know how to my fair countrywomen and let not an unmerited prejudice or displeasure against me remain any longer in their tender bosomsWhen you get into disgrace of any kind be assured that I will do as much for you  I am here as idle as ease of heart can make meI shall wait for you till the beginning of next month when if you do not come I shall proceed to while away the rest of the summer at  Crazy Castle  and  Scarborough  In the beginning the very beginning of October I mean to arrive in Bondstreet with my  Sermons  and when I have arranged their publication thenhey go mad for Italywhither you would do well to accompany meIn the mean time however I hope and wish to see  you here it will after all be much better than playing the  Strephon  with phthisical nymphs at the Bristol Fountain But do as you may  I am Most sincerely your's L STERNE  LETTER IX To  I DID not answer your letter as you desired me for at the moment I received it I really thought all my projects for some time to come were  burned  to a  cinder  or which is the better expression of the two had evaporated in smokefor not half an hour before an affrighted messenger on a breathless horse had arrived to acquaint me that the parsonage house atwas on fire when he came away and burning like a bundle of faggots and  while I was preparing to set off to see my house after it was burned down your letter arrived to console me on my way for it gave me every assurance that if I were left without an hole to put my head into or a rag to cover mybody you would give me a comfortable room in your house and a clean shirt into the bargain  In short by the carelessness of my curate or his wife or some one within his gates I am an house out of pocketI say literally out of pocket for I must rebuild it at my own costs and charges or the church of York who originally gave it me will do those things which in good sense ought not to be done but which the wiseacres who compose it will tell me they have a right to do My loss will be upwards of two hundred pounds with  some books c cso that you may now lay aside all your apprehensions about what I shall do with the wealth that my sermons have brought and are to bring to meI told you  then  that some devilish accident or other would provide me with the ends of getting rid of the means and I had a cross accident in my head at the time which I did not communicate to you but it is not that which has fallen out nor any thing like itthough this may fall out too for aught I know and then the fee simple of my sermons will be gone for ever  Now these sermons of mine were most of them written in the very house that is burned down and all of them preached I fear again and again in the very church to which it belonged and they now answer  a purpose I never dreamed or thought of but so it is in this world and thus are things hinged and hung togetheror rather unhinged or unhung for I have my doubts at present whether we shall see the dying gladiator next winter The matter however that concerns me most in the business is the strange unaccountable conduct of my poor unfortunate curate not in  setting fire  to the house for I do not accuse him of it God knows nor any one else but in  setting off  the moment after it happened and flying like  Paul  to  Tarsus  through fear of a prosecution from me  That the man should have formed such an idea of me as to suppose me capable if I did not sooth his sorrows of adding another to their number wounded me sorely  For amidst all my errors and sollies I do not believe there is any thing in the colour or complexion of any part of my life that would justify the shadow of such an apprehensionBesides he deprived me of all the comfort I made out to myself from the misfortune which was as it pleased Heaven to deprive him of one house to take him and his wife and his little one into anotherI mean into that where I lived myself And he who now reads my heart and will one day judge me for the secrets of ithe well knows that it did not grow cold within me on account of the accident till I was informed that this silly man was a fugitive from the fear of my wrath  The family of the Cs were kind to me beyond measure as they have always  have been They are a sort of people that you would like extremely and before the summer is past I hope to present you to them Though if I recollect aright you know the charming damsel of the house already and the rest of it though not so young or so fair are as amiable as she isAs I cannot leave you in possession of a better subject for your reflection c I shall say adieu and God bless youIn a few days you shall hear again from  Your affectionate and faithful L STERNE  I write this from Yorkwhere you may write to me  LETTER X To Esq  I HAVE received my dear friend your kind answer to my letter And you must know that it was just such an one as I wished to receive from youNay it was just such an one as I expected you would write to me I should have been disappointed if it had been in any other sorm or shape of friendship But understand me if you please I should have been disappointed for your sake and not for my own for though I am charmed that you should have made me those unreserved offers of friendship which are so gracious  in you I am almost as much pleased that my Exchequer is in that slate of sufficiency as not to require them  I have made my bargain for rebuilding my parsonage and settled all arrangements with all parties concerned in a manner more to my satisfaction than I could have expected I was rather in haste to settle this account that there might be no risque of leaving my wife and Lydia a dilapidation for their fortune for I have no reason to believe that the *** of *** would be more kind to them when friendless and unprotected than they had been to the husband of the one and the father of the other who when he was a poor Curate had pride enough to despise their Reverences and wit enough to make  others laugh at them But may God forgive them as I doAmen  I wrote to  Hall  an account of my disasterand his answer bid me find out a  conceit  on the occasion and comfort myself with it  Tully  the Orator the Politician the Philosopher the Moralist the Consul c c c adopted as he candidly tells us every one who reads his works this mode of consolation when he lost his daughter and if we may believe him with success Now this same  Tully  you must know was like my father I mean  Mr Shandy  of  Shandy Hall  who was as well pleased with a misfortune that gave him an opportunity of displaying his eloquence as with a  blessing  that obliged him to hold his tongue Both these great men were fond of conceits I mean their own so I will tell you a story  of a  Conceit  not of Cicero's nor my Father's but of the Lord of  Crazy  You must know then that this same friend of mine and I may add of your's also in a moment of lazy pride took it into his head that he would have a town chariot to save his feet by day and to carry him to Ranelagh in the evening For this purpose after consulting a coachmaker he had allotted  one hundred  and  forty pounds  and he wrote me word of it On my arrival in town about three months after this communication I found a card of invitation from  Lord Spencer  to dine with him on the following Sunday and I had no sooner read it than  Hall's  fine craneneck'd chariot came bounce as it were upon my recollection so I sallied forth to ask him how he did and to borrow  his carriage that I might pay my visit in pomp as well as  Pontificalibus  I found him at home made a friendly enquiry or two and told him of the little arrangement I had formed when he replied with one of his Cynical smiles that his mortification was in the extreme for that his chariot was gone post to Scotland I stared and he laughednot at me but at his own  conceit  and you shall have it such as it is  I must inform you then that at the moment when the coachmaker was receiving his last instructions he himself received a letter which letter acquainted him that his son who was quartered at  Edinburgh  had got into a terrible riot there to get out of the consequences of which demanded almost the precise sum  that had been destined for the chariot So that the  hundred and forty pounds  which had been set a part to build a chariot in London were employed to repair broken windows broken lamps and broken heads in Edinburgh and  Hall  comforted himself with the conceit that his chariot was gone  post  to  Scotland  So much for comforts and conceitsand happy is it for us when we can by any means  conceit  ourselves into comfort I could say more upon this matter but my paper is almost filled and I have only space to express a wish that your life may never want any of these petty helps to make it as happy as if I greatly mistake not it must be honourableLet me see you soon and in the mean time and at all times may God be with you  Your's most affectionately L STERNE  LETTER XI To Esq  Coxwould near Easingwould  YOU are not singular in your opinion about my  wonderful  capacity for poetry  Beauclerk  and  Lock  and I think  Langton  have said what you have said on the subject and founded their opinion as you have done on the sragment of an Introduction to the Ode to Julia in Tristram Shandy The unity of the episode would have been wounded if I had added another line and if I had added a dozen my character as a poetical  genius which by the bye I never had would have been lost for everor rather would never have been suspected  Hall  had also similar ideas on this very matter and on the strength of his opinion ventured once to giveme an unfinished poem of his own and bade me go on with itand so I did heltering and skeltering at a most terrible rateIn short I added some sixty or fourscore lines to the business which he called doggrel and which I think he called rightly however he chose to let them stand to use his own phrase as a curiosity so into the press they went and helped to compose the worst squib our crazy friend ever let off I do not however mention these things to lessen the merit of your opinion by pointing out its similarity to that of others  You need not be ashamed to think with such men if even they should be wrong which on this particular subject I most solemnly believe you all to be  Cum his errare  is somethingand all that  I once it is true wrote an epitaph which I liked myself but the person at whose request I did it sacrificed it to one of his own which he liked better but which I did notso my lines were thrown aside and his own nerveless rhime was engraved on a marble which deserved a better inscription for it covered the dust of one whose gentle nature and amiable qualities merited more than common praise or commonplace eulogium However I shed a tear over the sepulchre which if the dead could have known it would have been more acceptable than the  most splendid diction that ever glared on monumental alabaster  I also wrote a kind of Shandean singsong dramatic piece of rhyme for Mr  Beard  and he sung it at Ranelagh as well as on his own stage for the benefit of some one or other He asked for something of the kind and I knew not how to refuse him for a year before he had in a very respectful manner and without any previous acquaintance presented me with the freedom of CoventGarden Theatre The act was gracious and I liked it the better because the monarch of DruryLane had known me for some years and besides had for some time occupied a front seat in my page before he offered me the freedomnot of Drury Lane house but of DruryLane pit I told  him on the occasion that he  acted  great things and  did  little onesso he stammered and looked foolish and performed at length with a bad grace what his rival manager was so kind as to do with the best grace in the worldBut no more of thathe is so complete on the stage that I ought not to mention his patchwork off it  However to return to my subjectif I can for digression is interwoven with my nature and to get to my point or find my way back to it when I have wandered aside as other men do is not in the line of my facultiesBut though I may not be a poet the clerk of my parish isnot absolutely in my conceitbut which is better in that of his neighbours and which is the best of allin his own His muse is a professional one  for she only inspires him to indite hymns and it is appropriate for she leads him to such subjects as are suitable to his spiritual office and which like those of his brethren  Stera  ld  and  Hopkins  may be said or sung in churches In short there had been a terrible disease among the cattle and our parish had suffered greatly so that this parochial bard thought it a proper subject for a spiritual song which he accordingly composed and gave it out on the Sunday following to the praise and glory of God as an hymn of his own composing Not only the murrain itself but the sufferers by the calamity were vociferated through the aisles in all the pomp and devotion of rustic psalmody The last stanza which is the only one I recollect rather unhinged my devotion but it seemed to rivet that of the congregation  and therefore I had no right to complain I leave it with you as a  bonne bouche  and wish you a good night  Here's Jemmy How has lost a cow  And so has Johnny Bland  Therefore we'll put our trust in God  And not in any other man  Yours L S  LETTER XII To Esq  Coxwould  Wednesday Night  I SENT you my dear friend as you request it the Epitaph which I mentioned in my last epistle to you I write it from recollection and though it may not contain the precise expression it will certainly possess the sentiment of the original compositionand that is of the most consequence I remember well it came from the heart for I most sincerely loved the amiable person whose virtues deserved a better inscription and according  to a very common course of things found a worse But here it is  Columns and labour'd urns but vainly show  An idle scene of fabricated woe  The sweet companion and the friend sincere  Need no mechanic arts to force the tear  In heartfelt numbers never meant to shine  'Twill flow eternal o'er an hearse like thine  'Twill flow while gentle goodness has one friend  Or kindred tempers have a tear to lend  Hall  liked it I rememberand  Hall  always knows what ought to be liked and in certain humours will be candid upon these sentimental subjects and acknowledge that he feels them He is an excellent scholar and a good critic but his judgment has more severity than it ought to have and his taste less delicacy than it should possess He has also great humanity but somehow or other there is  so often such a mixture of sarcasm in it that there are many who will not believe he has a single scruple of it in his compositionNay I am acquainted with several who cannot be persuaded but that he is a very insensible hardhearted man which I who have known him long and known him well assure you he is notHe may not always possess the grace of charity but he feels the reality of it and continually performs benevolent actions though not always I must confess in a benevolent manner And here is the grief of the business He will do a kindness with a sneer or a joke or a smile when perhaps a tear or a grave countenance at least would better become him But this is his way it is the language of his character and though one might wish it to be otherwise yet I cannot tell what  right any of us have to pass a severe sentence upon it for no other reason in the world but because our own failings are of a different complexion And so much for all that  I am preparing to prance it for a week or ten days at  Scarborough  If you pass your autumn at  MulgraveHall  take that place in your way and I will accompany you on your visit and then to  Crazy Castle  and so home and then to Londonand then God knows wherebut it shall be where it pleases him this is  clerically  said however and it would be well for the best of us if it were thought and considered as often as it was said But so it is that the lips and the heart which ought never to be asunder are sometimes wandering at different corners of the earth Mine however  are in the closest conjunction when I offer you my most affectionate regard So good night and may the visions of a good spirit attend you  Most truly your's L STERNE  LETTTER XIII To Esq  Scarborough  I SHALL not reply my dear friend to all the kind things you think and say of meI trust indeed that I deserve some of them and I am well pleased to find that you think I deserve them allBut however that may be I desire you to cherish those benevolent sentiments which you have so warmly expressed in the paper before me both for your own sake and that of the person who is the subject of them  Your commands in general should be obeyed without reflectionbut in this particular instance a rare gleam of prudence has shot across me and I beg leave to reflect for a few moments on the subjectand were I to take wisdom upon me and reflect for a few daysthe result I am sure would be that I should not obey your commands at all  The giving advice my good friend is the most thankless generosity in the worldbecause in the first place it costs you nothing and in the next it is just such a thing as the person to whom you present it will think that he does not want This you see is my way of reasoning but I believe from my heart that it will apply too well to the subject between us  There are such things in the world as  wrong heads  and  right hearts  and  wrong hearts  and  right heads  Now for myself and speaking under the influence of my own particular feelings I would rather be of the  right heart  family with all their blunders errors and confusions but if I want a business to be done or a plan to be executed give me the  right head  if there is a  right heart  into the bargain so much the better but it is upon the  former  that I must relyand whether the latter be right or wrong is not a matter of absolute consideration This is not my dear friend quite orthodox according to your system but as you proceed every day will tend to encrease the propinquity of this opinion to your own  Now I am rather disposed to think without leaning to the uncharitable side of the question that pooris of the  Wronghead  familyI know his heartand I am sure his present scrape arises from the good dispositions of it Nevertheless though I think myself a dab at giving good counsel in such cases as his I cannot bring myself to prescribe on the occasionIt is impossible to do it without informing him of the nature of his disease which is neither more nor less than absolute wrongheadedness and were I to do it he would exhibit another symptom of his disorder by throwing my prescription out of the window and perhaps threatening the same mischief to the physician himself  If you have influence sufficient to induce him to apply to me I will most  readily exert my best for him and I can then do the bitter business and give the the unpalatable dose with a good grace Here then we will if you please let the matter rest for the present  I write in haste and on my pillow that you may as soon as possible be acquainted with my sentiments in a matter wherein you have a greater dependence upon me than I fear the event will justifySo good morning and God bless you  I received a letter yesterday from poor dear LydiaIt is an amiable madcapand God bless her alsoOnce more adieu  Yours c L STERNE  LETTER XIV  Scarborough  Aug  YOU refine too much my dear friendyou do indeedYour reasoning is ingenious and produces a neat pretty plausible train of argument that would make a figure in a company of female philosophers but if committed to paper would be pardonable only when written on the fan of some  pedantic Dulcinea  You run into divisions when a simple modulation would answer better that is would produce more pleasing effects both in yourself and the sentimental spirit whom you might wish to please  Opinion my dear fellow somehow or other rules all mankind and not like a kind master or which would be more congenial a gentle mistress but like a tyrant whose wish is power and whose gratification is servilityOpinion leads us by the ears the eyesand I had almost said by the  nose  It warps our ununderstandings confounds our judgments dissipates experience and turns our passions to its purpose In short it becomes the governess of our lives and usurps the place of reason which it has kicked out of officeThis is among the strange truths which cannot be explained but by that mortifying description which time will display to your experience hereafter with ten times the credit that would accompany any present endeavours of mine to the same purpose  If you would know more of the matter and can bring yourself to risque the opinion which by the bye I do not advise you to do ask A why he submits with such a placid subservience to the little wench who lives with him You knowand all his friends knowthat he has but half nay not half the enjoyments of life through the fear of her vengeance whatever it may be He has fortune understanding and couragehe loves society and adds greatly to the pleasures of itand yet how often does he leave it halfenjoyed Nay to come more home to the business how often has he left our pleasant classical meetings before they have arisen to their usual glow in order to humour this little piece of disgrace whom he has not the resolution to send back to the banks of the Wye where the fifty  pounds a year he might give her would make her queen of the villageWe pitty poor A we argue with him we wonder at himdo we notBut in this we deceive ourselvesfor the wisest and best of us are governed by some little dirty drab of an opinion whose governance is equally disgraceful and may be much more injuriousas it will perhaps give a colour to the whole current of our lives A mistress with all her arts and fascinations may in time be got rid of but opinion once rooted becomes a part of ourselvesit lives and dies with us  It must be acknowledged that I have been rather sermonic this fine morning but you know how and where to apply what has been written and I leave the whole to your practice if you think proper  and if you do notbut what have I to do with  ifs  It is an exceptious monosyllable and I fling it from me  B is here and tells me that he left you continually driving between London and RichmondWhat beauty of the Hill has enchanted you there Or what swan of the silver Thames are you dying forI take it very ill of you that you never favour me with a single communication concerning your  Dorothies  or your  Delias  I protest most seriously that I will never write to you again till you give me an history of your chains and who it is has bound you at present on the river's banktell me who the Naiad is  Mr F the Apostolic F as Lady calls him in his way to  hinted to me something serious He talked of a marriageto which I replied God forbidBut do not I pray be angry with my exclamation for it was neither a thoughtless or a peevish one but an impulse of that sincere regard which you more than deserve from meWith your dispositions and in your situation I hardly think there is a woman in the kingdom who would be an happy match for you and if you think proper to ask me I will hereafter tell you whyat present I shall content myself with telling you that  I am most cordially your's L STERNE  LETTER XV  September  I MEAN my dear friend that this epistle should meet you and greet you a day or two at least before you leave town and I wish it from that spirit of miserable selfinterest which you know governs and directs me in all I doBut lest you should not like this reason I will give you another and which may be ncarer the truth at least I hope so  I want very much to know whether  B has arranged the matter with  Foley  the banker at  Paris  about Mrs Sterne's remittance as I ordered him You must know that I suspect he has been dilatory not from dishonesty for I believe him to be as honest a poor creature as was ever vamped into the form he wears but perhaps his exchequer might not be in a convenient state to answer my orders and if so I only beg to be informed of the truth which as he does not answer my letters he appears to be afraid to tell  I have received a letter from  Toulouse  which does not comfort my spirits and I have reason to apprehend from thence that there is some neglect at the fountain head of my treasury which I must beg you to enquire into and if you see occasion to correct in order that the little  rill of ways and means may not be interrupted between  London  and  Languedoc  that is between me and Mrs Sterne and my poor dear Lydia  They write me word that they have drawn upon  Foley  as I desired who tells them he has no effects to answer the bill but that if they are in distress he will accommodate them for my sake This is very handsome dealing and I am rather proud of itbut in the mean time there is an uncertainty which is very unpleasantI mean to the poor women who are at such a distance that a great deal of anxious suspence must be suffered before the mistake can be rectified  Besides these things breed words and questions as well as suspicions and all  thatMy dear Lydia contents herself with a gentle complaint or so but her mother does not hesitate to discharge a volume of reproaches Now the truth is that I deserve neither the one nor the otherand had managed the matter for the supply of their wants and the ridding myself of all future anxiety in the business in as plain a manner as my handwriting and spirit of calculation could make itHowever it has abated the ardour of my Knight Errantry for the present and thrown more than a sickly thought or two on my imagination  I am prodigal of words my dear friend in a matter wherein a mere hint is all that would be necessary for you to exert yourself So do me the honour to see that it is absolutely done without a moment's delay  and if B should hesitate the tythe of an instantdo that for me my friend which I would do for you on a similar occasionSo God bless youMy heart will not suffer me to offer you an apology because I know it will be ungracious to your'sOnce more farewell  Most cordially your's L STERNE  LETTER XVI To Esq  Coxwould  Wednesday Evening  I HAVE received the Letter which you informed me I should receive from Doctor L and return you both my best thanks for itHe is certainly a man of Learning and an excellent Critic and would do well to employ his leisure hours on  Virgil  or rather if I understand him well on  Horace  and he would give us such a Commentary on both those Authors as we have not and perhaps may never have if he does not set about it  But  Tristram Shandy  my friend was made and formed to baffle all criticismand I will venture to rest the book on this groundthat it is either above the power or beneath the attention of any critic or hypercritic whatsoeverI did not fashion it according to any ruleI left my fancy or my Genius or my feelingscall it what you mayto its own free course without a single intruding reflection that there ever had been such a man as  Aristotle  in the world  When I mounted my Hobby Horse I never thought or pretended to think where I was going or whether I should return home to dinner or supper the next day or the next weekI let him take his own course and amble or curvet or trot or go a sober sorrowful Lackadaysical pace  as it pleased him bestIt was all one to me for my temper was ever in unison with his manner of coursing itbe it what it might I never pricked him with a spur or struck him with a whip but let the rein lay loosely on his neck and he was wont to take his way without doing injury to any one  Some would laugh at us as we passed alongand some seemed to pity usand now and then a melancholy tender hearted passenger would look at us and heave a sighThus have we travelled togetherbut my poor  Rosinante  did not like  Balaam's Ass  stand still if he saw an  Angel  in the way but directly pushed up to herand if it were but a damsel sitting by a fountain who would let me take a refreshing draught from her cup she was surely an Angel to me  The grand Error of Life is that we look too farWe scale the Heavenswe dig down to the centre of the Earth for Systemsand we forget ourselvesTruth lies before us it is in the high way path and the Ploughman treads on it with his clouted Shoon  Nature defies the rule and the LineArt raises its structures and forms its works on their aidbut Nature has her own Laws which Art cannot always comprehend and Criticism can never reach  Doctor L acknowledges however that my  Sermon on Conscience  is a most admirable composition but is of opinion that it is degraded by being made a part of  Tristram Shandy  Now if you please be so good as to note my answerIf this  sermon is so excellent and I myself believe it to be sobecause  Judge Burnet  who was a man of taste and erudition as well as Law desired me to print itI say if it be a good Sermon it ought to be read and since it appeared in the pages of  Tristram Shandy  it has been read by thousands whereas the fact is that when it was published by itself it was read by no one  I have answered Doctor L with all the respect which his amiable Character and admirable Talents deserve but I have told him at the same time that my book was not written to be tried by any known Laws of Scholastic Criticism and that if I thought any thing I might hereafter write would be within their reach I would throw the Manuscript that is now before me into the fire and never dip my pen into  my Inkstand again but for the purpose of assuring some uncritical and uncriticising friend like yourself of my sincere and cordial regardAt this moment I make that offering to youSo God be with you  L S  I begin to peep out of my hermitage a little for Lord and Lady Fauconberg are come down and bring with them as usual a large store of amiable easy and hospitable virtuesI wish you were here to partake of and add to them  LETTER XVII To Esq  Monday Evening  YOU have hit my fancy most wonderfully in the account you have given me of Lady the Juno character not only prevails but absolutely predominates The  Minerva  qualities are all secondaryand as to any  Cyprian  dispositions I know nothing about them  She certainly possesses a very good understanding and is not without attainments but both the one and the other  derive all their consequence from her mannersShe has somewhat of an imperious disposition which would be either silently despised by some or violently opposed by others if she did not give a grace to it that annihilates any unpleasant sensation that might attempt to rise in the breast of a bystander or which is better bysitter but this is not all for it calls forth also that kind of respectful submission which does not lessen us in our own opinion for having practised it  I never in my life felt the merit of exterior decoration so much as in my conversations and communications with this Lady and I really do not know any position in the present school of fashion where a young man might learn so much as in her drawing room or without meaning  any mischievous equivoque her dressing roomIt is really no common satisfaction to me to reflect that my young friend is an  El√©ve  of such an instructress  There is a time and circumstance of life and that period and circumstance are now yours when nothing but the easy society and little tender friendships of an accomplished woman are wanting to render a character completeand without saying a word more than I think on the businessI cannot but express my satisfaction that you are in such hands as will probably produce the very effects which so sincere a friend as myself can wish and desire  It has ever been a maxim with me since I knew any thing of the world that  we are all of us as much in want of a Schoolmistress at the finish as we do at the commencement of our education And as you are so fortunate as to have Lady to teach you the  Hornbook  of high life you will bid fair to spell it and put it together so as to become the charm of all societyand you will lose what I so much wish you to lose the attention to one and the neglect of the many which though there may be something amiable in the principle is not adapted to the general intercourse of life  Lady M F might forward business and Lady C I am sure is ready to do itso that in such a soil in such a season and with such cultivations what has not partial friendship a right to expect And now what can I do better than leave you  in such good and excellent company and desire you in return to present my respectful compliments to them alland to receive yourself the most cordial regard of  your very sincere and affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XVIII To  Coxwould  Wednesday Noon  I UNDERSTAND from Mr Phipps  The Late  Lord Mulgrave  that you are absolutely engaged to pass the Summer or rather the Autumn with him at  MulgraveHall  so that I now consider a previous visit to me as a matter on which I may depend and to which believe me I look with real satisfaction We will while away a month or six weeks at my vicarage in a manner which I trust will not be unpleasing or unprofitable to you  However in saying this or rather writing it I address myself to the excellence of your heart which I cannot enough admire and that cultivated understanding of which I have the greatest hopesI know the pleasures you will quit and the societies you must sacrifice to come and pass any part of the Summer with me but at the same time I do not doubt of your visitand that a Shande an  T√™te √° T√™te  has its charms for you  I remember a circumstance which I shall never think of without the utmost pride in my own heart and the most sincere affection for yoursbut besides that it flattered me in the highest degree it proved that you possessed a source of sentiment which whatever may befall you in life must preserve you in honour and happinesswith  such a delicious quality misfortune will never be able to bear you down nor will folly passion or even vice though they may for a time obscure or lessen the excellence of your character possess the power of destroying itI allude to a little delicate touch of sentiment that escaped you last winterwhich though I have mentioned it with every possible eulogium to others again and again I have never before hinted it even to you the moment however is now come when my spirit urges me to speak of it and I do it with those dispositions which are congenial to the subject and I trust natural to myself  You cannot absolutely have forgotten an evening visit which you paid me last January in Bond Street when I was ill in bednor ought it to escape your occasional  reflection that you sat by my bedside the whole night performing every act of the most friendly and pious attentionI then thought that the scarecrow death was at my heelsnay I thought the villain had got me by the throatand I told you as muchHowever it pleased Heaven that I should not be snatched from the world at that moment though I spoke my own honest opinion when I vaticinated my destiny by expressing little hopes of getting to the winter's endI believe my dear friend said I that I shall soon be offI hope not you replied with a squeeze of my hand and a sigh of your heart which went to the very bottom of minebutyou were pleased to add lest that should be the case I hope you will do me the favour to let me be always with you that I may have every atom of  advantage and comfort your society may afford me while Heaven permits it to last  I spoke no reply for I could notbut my heart made one then and will continue to do sotill it is become  a clod of the Valley  Hence it is that I do not doubt but you will quit the ring of pleasure without regret to come and sit with me beneath my HoneySuckle which is now flaunting like a Ranelagh beauty and accompany me in paying my nuns their pensive evening visitWe can go to vespers with them and return home to our curds and cream with more delicious sentiments than all the pleasures of the world and the  beauties thereof in their vainest moments can truly afford  I am busy about another couple of volumes to amuse and as I hope to instruct a gouty and a splenetic worldin which I solemnly declare I have no Ambition to remain but for the love I bear to such friends as you and perhaps the vanity which I am vain enough not to call an idle one of adding a few more leaves to the wreath which I have been able to weave for my own little glory  Come then and let me read the pages to you as they fall from my pen and be a  Mentor  to  Tristram  as you have been to  Yorick  At all eventsI am sure you cannot come to York without coming to me and I shall triumph completely over  Lady Lepel  c if I draw you for a month from the bright centre to which you are so naturally attracted So God bless youand believe me with all sincerity to be  Most affectionately your's L STERNE  LETTER XIX To  Bishopthorp  Thursday night  I SAW the charming  Mrs Vesey  but for a moment and she contrived with her voice and her thousand other graces to  disorder  me and what she will have to answer for on the occasion I shall not employ my casuistry to determinenor shall I ask my good friend the Archbishop from whose house and amidst whose kindness and hospitality I address this to you  I envy however your saunter together round an  empty Ranelagh  though I should  have liked it the better because it was empty and would give the imagination and every delicious feeling opportunity to make one forget there was another being in the roombut ourselves  You will I am sure more than understand me when I mention that sense of female perfectionI mean however when the female is sitting or walking beside youwhich so possesses the mind that the whole Globe seems to be occupied by none but twoWhen your hearts in perfect unison or I should rather say harmony with each other produce the same chordsand blossom with the same flowers of thought and sentiment  These hourswhich virtuous tender minds have the power of separating from  the melancholy seasons of lifemake ample amends for the weight of cares and disappointments which the happiest of us are doomed to bearThey cast the brightest sunshine on the dreary landscapeand form a kind of refuge from the stormy wind and tempest  With such a companion is not the primrose bank and the cottage which humble virtue has raised on its side superior to all that splendour and wealth has formed in the palaces of monarchsThe scented heath is then the  Perfumed Araby  and though the Nightingale should refuse to lodge among the branches of the poor solitary tree that overshadows usif my fair minstrel did but pour forth the melting strain I would not look to the musick of the spheres for ravishment  There is something my dear friend most wonderfully pleasant in the idea of getting away from the worldand though I have ever found it a great comfort yet I have been more vain of the business when I have done it in the midst of the worldBut this  aberration  from the crowd while you are surrounded and pressed by it is only to be accomplished by the magic of female perfectionFriendship with all its powersmere friendship cannot do itA more refined sentiment must employ its influence to wrap the heart in this delicious oblivionIt is too pleasing to last longfor envious sleepless care is ever on the watch to awake us from the bewitching trance  You my friend possess something of the reality of it and I while I enjoy your  happiness apply to fancy for the purpose of creating a copy of itSo I sit myself down upon the turf and place a lovely fair one by my sideas lovely if possible as Mrs V and having plucked a sprig of blossoms from the Maybush I place it in her bosom and then address some tender tale to her heartand if she weeps at my story I take the white handkerchief she holds in her hand and wipe the tears from off her cheek and then I dry my own with itand thus the delightful vision gives wing to a lazy hour calms my spirits and composes me for my pillow  To wish that care may never plant a thorn upon yours would be an idle employment of votive regardbut that you may preserve the virtue which will blunt  their points and continue to possess the feelings which will sometimes pluck them away is a wish not unworthy of that friendship with which  I am your most affectionate L STERNE  PS Lydia writes me word she has got a loverPoor dear Girl  LETTER XX To  Sunday Evening  DO not imagine my dear Boyand do not suffer I beseech you any pedantic coldhearted fellow to persuade youthat  sensibility is an evil  You may take my word on this subject as you have been pleased to do on many othersthat sensibility is one of the first blessings of lifeas well as the brightest ornament of the human character  You do not explain matters to me which by the bye is not fair but I suppose  from the tenor of your letter which is now beside me that you have been made a dupe of by some artful personwho I am disposed to think is some  cunning baggage  and that under the impressions of this game that has been played you your vanity is alarmed and your understanding piqued and then you lay all this dire grievance in a very pettish manner let me tell you at the door of your sensibility And which is worse than all the rest you write to me as if you really believed yourself to be in earnest in all the seesaw observations you have written to me on the subject  Be assured my dear friend if I thought the sentiments of your last letter were not the sentiments of a sickly momentif I could be made to believe for an instant  that they proceeded from you in a sober reflecting condition of your mindI should give you over as incurable and banish all my hopes of your rising into that proud honour and brilliant reputation which I trust you will one day possess  I was almost going to writeand wherefore should I notthat there is an amiable kind of  cullibility  which is as superior to the slow precaution of worldly wisdom as the sound of  Abel's Viol di Gamba  to the braying of an ass on the other side of my paling  If I should at any time hear a man pique himself upon never having been a dupeI should grievously suspect that such an one will some time or other give  cause to be thought at best a meanspirited dirty rascal  You may think this a strange doctrinebut be that as it mayI am not ashamed to adopt itWhat would you say of any character who had neither humanity generosity nor confidenceWhy you would sayI know you wouldsuch a man  Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils  And yet impositionduperydeceptioncall it by what name you willattends upon these virtues like their shadow For virtue my dear friend like every other possession in this world though it is the most valuable of allis of a mixed nature and the very inconveniences of it if they deserve that name form the basis on which its importance and natural excellence is established  Sensibility is oftentimes betrayed into a foolish thingbut its folly is amiable and some one or other is the better for it I am not for its excessesor a blind submission to its impulse which produces themyet some how or other I should be strongly disposed to hug the being who would take the rag off his backto place it on the shivering wretch who had nought to cover him  Discretion  is a cold qualitybut I have no objection to the possessing as much of itas will direct your finer feelings to their proper objectsbut here let its office finish if it proceeds a step further there may be mischiefit may cool that currrent which is the lifeblood of all virtue and will I trust warm your heart till it is become a clod of the valley  Sensibility is the source of those delicious feelings which give a brighter colour to our joys and turn our tears to raptureThough it may now and then lead us into a serape as we pass through lifeyou may be assured my dear friend it will get us out of them all  at the end of it  and that is a matter which wiser men than myself will tell you is well worth thinking about  So leaving you to your contemplationsand wishing them and every thing you do an happy issueI remain with great truth  your affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XXI To  Bond Street  Thursday Morning  So my dear friend you are pleased to be very angry with the  Reviewers  so am not Ibut as your displeasure proceeds from your regard for meI thank you as I ought to doagain and again  I really do not know to whom I am personally indebted for so much obliging illiberalityNor can I tell whether it is the society at large or a splenetic Individual to whom I am to acknowledge my obligationI have never enquired who it  is or who they areand if I knew him or themwhat would it signifyand wherefore should I give their names immortality in my writings which they will never find in their ownLet the Asses bray as they likeI shall treat their worships as they deserve in my own way and mannerand in a way and manner that they will like less than any other  There is a certain race of people who are ever aiming to treat their betters in some scurvy way or otherbut it has ever been a practice with me not to mind a little dirt thrown upon my coatso that I keep my  lining unrumpled  And so much for that envy ignorance and illnature for which what I have written is far too much  I am rejoiced however for twenty good reasons which I will tell you hereafter that London lies in your way between Oxforshire and Suffolk and one of them I will tell you nowwhich is that you can be of very great service to me so I would desire you to prepare yourself to do me a kindness if I did not know that you are always in such a state of preparation  The town is so empty that though I have been in it full four and twenty hours I have seen only three people I knowFoote on the stageSir Charles Davers at St James's Coffeehouse and Williams who was an hasty bird of passage on his flight to Brigthelmstone where I am told he is making love in right earnest to a very fine woman and with all the success his friends can wish him Our races at York were every thing we could desire  them to be in the ballroom and every thing we did not desire them to be on the ground The rain said nay with a vengeance to the sports of the course for all the waterspouts of the heavens seemed to be let loose upon it However in the amusements  under cover  we were all as merry as heart could wish I had promised a certain person that you should be there and was obliged to parry a score or two of reproaches on your account  But though I forgot to tell it you before I am by no means well and if I do not get away from this climate before winter sets in I shall never see another spring in this world and it is to forward my journey to the South that I request you to make haste to me from the West  Alas alas my friend I begin to feel that I lose strength in these annual struggles and encounters with that miserable scarecrow who knows as well as I do that do what I can he will finally get the better of me and all of us Indeed he has already beat the vizard from my helmet and the point of my spear is not as it was wont to be But while it pleases heaven to grant me life it will I trust grant me spirits to bear up against the sawey circumstances of it and preserve to my last separating sigh that sensibility to whatever is kind and gracious which when once it possesses the heart makes I trust ample amends for a large portion of human error  You may indeed believe that while I am sensible of any thing I shall be sensible  of your friendship and I have every reason to think that should my term be drawing nigh to its period you will continue to love me while I live and when I am no more to cherish the memory of  Your ever faithful and affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XXII To  Sunday Morning  IF you wish to have the representation of my spare meagreformwhich by the bye is not worth the canvas it must be painted onyou shall be most welcome to it and I am happy in the reflection that when my bones shall be laid low there may be any resemblance of me which may recall my image to your friendly and sympathizing recollection  But you must mention the business to  Reynolds  yourself for I will tell you why I cannot He has already painted a very excellent portrait of me which when I went to pay him for he desired me to accept as a tribute to use his own elegant and flattering expression that his heart wished to pay to my genius That man's way of thinking and manners are at least equal to his pencil  You see therefore the delicacy of my situation as well as the necessity if the genius of  Reynolds  is to be employed in the business of your taking it entirely upon yourself Or if your friendly impatience which you express with so much kindness will let you wait till we make our tour to  Bath  your favorite  Gainshorough  may do the deed  Or why not your little friend  Cosway  who is rising fast into fame and fortune But be it as you please and arrange it according to your own fancy  At all events I shall treat myself when I get to Rome with my own busto if  Nollikens  does not make a demand for it that may be inconsistent with my Exchequer The statuary decorations of my grandfather the Archbishop's monument in the Cathedral at York which you admire so much have given birth I believe to this whim of mine and this piece of marble which my vanityfor let it be vanity if you pleasedestines for myself may be placed by the hand of friendship and by yours perhaps near my graveand so much for that  But I was born for digressions and I therefore tell you at once not rashly or prematurely but with all due sobriety and reflection that Lord is of a low base pimping nature If he had been nothing but a fool I should have saidHave mercy upon him but he has just understanding sufficient to make him answerable for what he does and not sufficient to perceive the superiority of what is great over what is littleIf ever that man rises into a good or a noble action I would be bound to be considered as a retailer of scandal and an illnatured man as long as I live and as long as my memory lives but no more of him I beseech youand the hour tells me to write no more of any thing for I must hasten where I ought to have been half an  hour agoso God bless you and believe me where ever I am to be  Most cordially yours L STERNE  LETTER XXIII To  Monday Morning  THE story my dear friend which you heard related with such an air of authority is like many other true stories absolutely false Mr  Hume  and I never had a disputeI mean a serious angry or petulant dispute in our livesindeed I should be most exceedingly surprized to hear that  David  ever had an unpleasant contention with any manand if I should be made to believe that such an event had happened nothing  would persuade me that his opponent was not in the wrong for in my life did I never meet with a being of a more placid and gentle nature and it is this amiable turn of his character that has given more consequence and force to his scepticism than all the arguments of his sophistryYou may depend on this as a truth  We had I remember well a little pleasant sparring at Lord  Hertford  's table at  Paris  but there was nothing in it that did not bear the marks of goodwill and urbanity on both sidesI had preached that very day at the Ambassador's Chapel and  David  was disposed to make a little merry with the  Parson  and in return the Parson was equally disposed to make a little  mirth with the  Infidel  we laughed at one another and the company laughed with us bothand whatever your informer might pretend he certainly was not one of that company  As for his other history that I preached an offensive sermon at the Ambassador's Chapelit is equally founded in truth for Lord Hertford did me the honour to thank me for it again and again The  text  I will own was an  unlucky  one and that was all your informer could have heard to have justified his reportIf he fell asleep immediately after I repeated itI will forgive him  The fact was as follows  Lord  Hertford  had just taken and furnished a magnificent  Hotel  and as every thing and any thing gives the fashion of the moment at Paris it had been the fashion for every one to go to see the English Ambassador's new hotelIt occupied the curiosity formed the amusement and gave a subject of conversation to the polite circles of Paris for a fortnight at least  Now it fell to my lot that is to say I was requested to preach the first day service was performed in the chapel of this new hotelThe message was brought me when I was playing a sober game of Whist with the  Thornhills  and whether it was that I was called rather abruptly from my afternoon's amusement to prepare myself for this business for it was to be on the next day  or from what other cause I do not pretend to determine but that unlucky kind of fit seized me which you know I can never resist and a very unlucky text did come into my headand you will say so when you read it  "And Hezekiah said unto the Prophet I have shewn them my vessels of gold and my vessels of silver and my wives and my concubines and my boxes of ointment and whatever I have in my house have I shewn unto them and the Prophet said unto Hezekiah thou hast done very foolishly"  Now as the text is a part of Holy writ that could not give offence though wicked wits are sometimes disposed to illtreat  it with their own scurvy misrepresentationsAnd as to the discourse itself nothing could be more innocent and  David Hume  favoured it with his grace and approbation  But here I am got I know not how writing about myself for whole pages togetherwhereas the only part of my letters that can justify my being an egotist is when I assure any gentle spirit or faithful friend as I now do you that I am her or his or your  Most affectionate humble servant L STERNE  LETTER XXIV To  Wednesday Noon  BELIEVE me my dear friend I have no great faith in Doctors Some eminent ones of the faculty assured me many years ago that if I continued to do as I was then doing I should not live three months Now the fact is that I have been doing exactly what they told me I ought not to do for thirteen years togetherand here I am as thin it is true but as saucy  as ever and it will not be my fault if I do not continue to give them the lie for another period of equal duration  It is Lord  Bacon  I think who observesat least be it who it may that made the observation it is not unworthy the great man whose name I have just writtenThat Physicians are old women who sit by your bedside till they kill you or Nature cures you  There is an uncertainty in the business that often baffles experience and renders genius abortiveTho' I mean not believe me to be severe on a science which is sometimes made the means of doing good Nay the science itself considered naturally and physically is the eye of all the rest But  I do not always hold my peace when I reflect on those selfconceited upstart professors of it who fly and bounce and give themselves airs if you do not read the directions upon the label of a phial which contains the matter of their prescriptions with as much reverence as if it had been penned by St  Luke  himself  Goddess of Healthlet me drink thy healing and sustaining beverage at the pure fountain which flows at thy command Give me to breathe the balmy air and to feel the enlivening sunand so I willfor if I do not see you in fifteen days I will on the sixteenth step quickly into the Dover coach and proceed without you to the banks of the  Rhone  where you may follow me if you pleaseand if you do not  the difference between us will bethat while you are passing your Christmasday in fencing against fogs by warm cloaths and large fires I shall be sitting on the grass courting no warmth but the allcheering one which proceeds from the grand luminary of nature  So think on these things I beseech youand let me know about it for I will not remain gasping another month in London even for your sakeor for your company whichI might add would be for my own sake  In the mean time and at all times may God bless you  I am most cordially your's L STERNE  LETTER XXV To  Wednesday Noon  I AM always getting into a scrape not from a carelesness of offending as some goodhumoured people have suspected for I do not wish to give offence but from the want of being understoodPope has well expressed the hardship of being forced  to trudge  Without a second and without a judge  I think the quotation is correctIndeed a man may proceed well enough without a second Genius is oftentimes so far from wanting such an assistant that it is frequently clogged by itbut to be without a judge is a mortification which comes home with much severity to the bosoms of those who feel or fancy which is pretty near the same thing that judgmentI mean impartial adequate judgment would be their reward  To be eternally misunderstood and which naturally follows to be eternally misrepresented by ignorance is far far worse than to be slandered by maliceCalumny is more than oftentimes for it is almost always the sacrifice which vice pays to virtue and folly offers up to wisdomA wise man while he pities the efforts  of slander will feel a kind of consequence from the exertion of themlike the philosopher who is said to have raised a monument to his own fame with the stones which the malignity of his competitors had thrown at him  The divorce between virtue and reputation is too common to be wondered atthough it is too unjust not to be lamented but that being a circumstance which connects itself with something like the general order of Providence we are able to console ourselves under it by hope and resignation But in the little and comparatively speaking the petty business of human famethe mind may be justified in kicking at the perversions to which its honest and best endeavours are so continually subject  I do most sincerly assure you that I have seldom been so proud of myself and the little display of my talentswhatever they may beas I was in the very circumstance which has given so much uneasiness I intended no severityI was all complacency and good humourmy spirits were in unison with every generous and gracious thoughtand so far was I from possessing the idea of giving offence  and to a Lady  that there never was a moment of my life perhaps when I was so disposed to buckle on my armour and mount my  Rosinante  to go and fight the cause of injured or captive beautyBut instead of all this here am I considered as the very monster whom I myself was ready to combat and to destroy  You will therefore be so good as to communicate these thoughts in as much better a manner as you please to Mrs H and assure her that she has only done what so many have done before herthat is she has  misconceived  or as that word may produce a  misconception  she has  misunderstood  me  So far I am most willing to travel in the highway of apology and if she is disposed to smile I will receive her returning favour with all due acknowledgments but if she should think it clever or witty or consequential to continue to be offendedI will not fail to remember her in a postscript to my chapter on the right and wrong end of a woman  which though my uncle Toby from a certain combination of circumstances could never be made to understand I will explain to the world in such a manner that they who run may read  I am not however unintelligible to all There are some spirits who want no key either to my speech or my writings and theyI mean the spiritsare of the first order This is some comfort and that comfort increases both in its weight and measure on the reflection that you are one of them  But my paper and postman's bell both warn me to dowhat I ought to have done at least a page ago  and that is to write adieu so adieu and God bless you  I am most cordially yours L STERNE  LETTER XXVI To  Thursday Nov  WERE I a Minister of Stateinstead of being a countryparsonor rather though I do not know that it is the better thing of the twowere I king of a country not like  SanchoPancha  without a will of my own but with all the rights privileges and immunities belonging to such a situation I would not suffer a man of genius to be pulled to pieces or pulled down or even whistled at by any man who had not some sort of genius  of his ownThat is to say I would not suffer blockheads of any denomination to shew their heads in my territories  Whatwill you sayis there no saving clause for the ignorant and the unletteredNo spot set apart for those on whom science has not beamed or the current of whose genius poverty has frozenMy dear friend you do not quite understand meand I beg of you not to supposethat all men are  blockheads  who are not  learned  and that no man who is  learned  can be a  blockhead  My definitions are not borrowed from the common room of a College or the dull muzzing  pericranium  of a wordmongering dictionary maker but from  the book of Nature the volume of the world and the pandects of experience There I find a  blockhead  to be a man for I am not at present in a humour to involve the poor women in the definition who thinks he has what in fact he has notand who does not know how to make a right use of that which he has  It is the mode of applying  means  to  ends  that marks the character of superior understandingThe poor scarecrow of a beast that  Yorick  rode so long and to the last being once set in the right road will sooner get to the end of his journey than the fleetest racehorse of  Newmarket  who has taken an opposite direction  Wisdom  very often cannot read or write and  Folly  will often quote you passages  from all the  dead  and half the living languages I beg therefore you will not sorm a badthat is to say a false idea of this kingdom of minefor whenever I get it you may be sure of being well appointed and living at your ease as every one must do  there  who lives to his honourBut to the point  To the point did I sayAlas there is so much  zigzag  in my destiny that it is impossible for me to keep going on strait through one poor letterand that to a friend but so it isfor here is a visitor arrived to whom I cannot say nayand who obliges me to write adieu a page or two or three perhaps before I intended to do it I must therefore fold up my paper as it isand shall only add God bless you  which however is the constant and sincerest wish of  your affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XXVII To  Dijon  Nov  MY DEAR FRIEND  I recommend it to younot perhaps above all things but very assuredly above most thingsto stick to your own understanding a little more than you do for believe me an ounce of it will answer your purpose better than a pound weight of other people's There is a certain timidity which renders early life amiable  as a matter of speculation but is very inconvenient indeed not to say dangerous according to the present humour of the world in matters of practice  There is a manly confidence which as it springs from a consciousness of possessing certain excellent qualities and valuable attainments we cannot have too early and there is no more impropriety in offering manifestations of it to the world than the putting on your helmet in the day of battle We want it as a protectionI say as a protection from the insults and injuries of others for in your particular circumstances I consider it merely as a defensive qualityto prevent you from being run down or run over by the first ignorant blockhead or insolent coxcomb who perceives  your modesty to be a restraint on your spirit  But this by the wayThe application of it is left to your own discernment and good sense of which I shall not write what I think and what some others think whose testimony will wear well  I am so much better pleased since I set my foot on the Continent that it would do you good to seeand more good still to hear me for I have recovered my voice in this genial climate and so far am I now from finding a difficulty to make myself heard across the table that I am almost fit to preach in a cathedral  Here they are all heygomadThe vintage has been abundant and is now at  the close Every eye beams delight and every voice is attuned to joyThough I am running away as fast as I can well go and am withal so pressed by the rascal death that I ought not in prudence to take time to look behind me yet cannot I resist the temptation of getting out of my chaise and sitting for a whole evening on a bank to see those happy people dance away the labours of the day and thus they contrive for two or three hours at least out of the four and twenty  to forget  God bless 'em that there are such things as labour and care in the world  This innocent oblivion of sorrow is one of the happiest arts of life and philosophy in all its storehouse of human remedies has nothing like unto it Indeed I  am persuaded that mirtha sober well regulated mirthis perfectly acceptable to the kind Being that made usand that a man may laugh and sing and dance tooand after all go to Heaven  I never couldand I never cannay I positively never will believe that we were sent into this world to go sorrowing through it On the contrary every object around methe rural dance and the rustic minstrelsy that I behold and hear from my window tell me that man is framed for joy Nor shall any crackbrained Carthusian Monkor all the Carthusian Monks in the worldpersuade me to the contrary  Swist  says  vive la bagatelle  I say  vive la joie  which I am sure is no  bagatelle  but  as I take it a very  serious thing  and the first of human possessions  May your treasury my dear friend continue to have good store in itand like the  widow's cruse  may it fail not  At  Lyons  I expect to find some tidings of you and from thence I will dispatch some further tidings of myselfSo in the mean time and at all times may God bless youBelieve me  I shall ever remain most truly And affectionately your's L STERNE  LETTER XXVIII To  Lyons  Nov  I have travelled hither most deliciouslythough I have made my journey in a  d√©sobl√©geant  and of course alone But when the heart is at rest and the mind is in harmony with itself and every subordinate feeling is well attuned not an object offers itself to the attention but may be made to produce pleasureBesides such is the character of this happy people that you  see a smile on every countenance and hear the notes of joy from every tongueThere is an old woman at this moment playing on the viol before my window and a groupe of young people are dancing to it with more appearance and I believe more  reality  of pleasure than all your brilliant assemblies at  Almack  's can boast  I love my country as well as any of her childrenand I know the solid characteristic virtues of its peoplebut they do not play the game of happiness with that attention or success which is practised and obtained hereI shall not enter into the physical or moral difference between the two nationsbut I cannot however help observing that while the French possess  a gaity of heart that always weakens and sometimes baffles sorrow the English still answer the description of the  old  Frenchman and really continue to divert themselves  moult tristement  Nay how often have I seen at a  York Assembly  two young people dance down thirty couple with as grave countenances as if they did it for hire and were after all not sure of being paid and here have I beheld the sunburnt sons and daughters of labor rise from their scanty meal with not a pulse in their hearts that did not beat to pleasureand with the brightest looks of satisfaction make their wooden shoes responsive to the sound of a brokenwinded hautboy  All the world shall never persuade me there is not a Providence and a gracious one too which governs it With every blessing under the sun we look grave and reason ourselves into dissatissaction while herewith scarce any blessing  but the Sunon est content de son √®tat  But the kind Being who made us all gives to each the portion of happiness according to his wise and good pleasure for no oneand nothing is beneath his allprovidential care  he even tempers the wind to the shorn lamb  By such reflections and under such influences I am perverted from my purpose for when I drew my chair to the table  and dipped my pen into the inkhorn I breathed nothing but complaint and it was my sole design to tell you sofor I have sent  a la poste restante  again and again and there is no letter from you But though I am impatience itself to continue my journey towards the  Alps  and cannot possibly indulge my curious spirit till I hear from you yet such is the effect of my sympathetic nature that I have caught all the ease and good humour of the people about me and seem to be sitting here in my black coat and yellow slippers as contented as if I had not another step to take and God knows I have a pretty circuit to make my friend before I may embrace you again  It is not as you well know my practice to icratch out any thing I write or I would  erase the last dozen lines as the very moment I had concluded them your letter and two others arrived and brought me every thing I could wishI would really linger if I thought you would overtake me At all events we shall meet at  Romeat Rome  and I shall now take the wings of tomorrow morning to forward my progress thither  I sincerely hope this paper may be thrown away upon youthat is I wish you may be come away before it has made its passage to EnglandAt all events my dear boy we shall meet at Rome So till thenfare thee wellthere and every whereI shall be  Your most faithful and affectionate Ls L STERNE  LETTER XXIX To  Bond Street  I HAVE a great mind to have done with joking laughing and merrymaking for the rest of my days with either man woman or child and set up for a grave formal seesaw character and dispense stupid wisdom as I have hitherto been said to have done sensible nonsense to my countrymen and countrywomen  To tell you the truthI began this letter yesterday morning and was interrupted  in getting to the end of it by half a dozen idle people who called upon me to lounge and to laugh though one of them forced me home with him to dine with his sister whom I found to be a being of a superior order and who has absolutely made the something like a resolution with which I began this letter not worth the feather of the quill with which it was written  She is in good faith charming beyond my powers of description and we had such an evening as made the cup of tea she gave me more delicious than nectar  By the bye she wishes very much to become acquainted with younot believe me from any representations or biography of mine but from the warm encomiums she  has received of you from others and those as she says of the first order After all this however you may be sure that my testimony was not wantingSo that when you will give an opportunity I shall have the honour of presenting you to kiss her hand and add another devout worshipper at the temple of such transcendant merit  I am really of opinion that if there is a woman in the world formed to do you good and to make you love her into the bargainwhich I believe is the only way of doing you any goodthis is the preeminent and bewitching characterIndeed were you to command my seeble powers to deliniate the lovely being whose affections would well repay thee for all the heartachs and disquieting apprehensions that may and will afflict thee in thy passage through life  it would be this fair and excellent creature  My Knight Errant  spirit has already told her that she is a  Dulcinea  to mebut I would most willingly take off my armour and break my spear and resign her as an  Angel  to you  I need not say any thing I trust of my affection for you and I have just now some singular ideas on your subject which kept me awake last night when I ought to have been found asleepbut I shall reserve them for the communication of my fireside or your's as it may be and I wish as devoutly as ever I wished any thing in my life that my fire was to brighten before you this very evening  In the name of fortunefor want of a better at the momentwhat business have  you to be fifty leagues from the capital at a time when I stand so much in need of you for your own sake  I hear you exclaimwhom is all this aboutAnd I see you half determined to throw my letter into the fire because you cannot find her name in it This is all my good friend as it ought to befor you may be assured that I never intended to write her name on this sheet of paper I have told you of the divinity and you will find the rest inscribed on the altar  I was never more serious in my life so let the wheels of your chariot roll as rapidly as posthorses can make them towards this town where if you come not soon I shall be gone and then I know not what may become of all my  present  good intentions towards youfuture ones it is true I shall have in plentyfor at all events in all circumstances and every where  I am Most cordially and affectionately your's L STERNE  LETTER XXX To  Friday  THESE may be piping times to you my dear friend and I rejoice at itbut they are not dancing ones to me  You will perceive by the manner in which this letter is written that if I dance  Holbein  's piper must be the fidler  Since I wrote to you last I have burst another vessel of my lungs and lost blood  enough to pull down a very strong man what it has done then with my meagre form clad as it is with infirmities may be better imagined than describedIndeed it is with difficulty and some intervals of repose that I can trail on my pen and if it were not for the anxious forwardness of  my spirits  which aids me for a few minutes by their precious Mechanism I should not be able to thank you at allI know I cannot thank you as I ought for your four letters which have remained so long unanswered and particularly for the last of them  I really thought my good friend that I should have seen you no more The grim scarecrow seemed to have taken post at the foot of my bed and I had not strength to laugh him off as I had hitherto doneso I bowed my head in patience without the  least expectation of moving it again from my pillow  But somehow or other he has I believe changed his purpose for the presentand we shall I trust embrace once again I can only add that while I live I shall be  Most affectionately your's L STERNE  LETTER XXXI To  Bondstreet  May  I Felt the full force of an honest heartach on reading your last letterThe story it contains may be placed among the most affecting relations of human calamity and the happiest efforts of human benevolence I happened to have it in my pocket yesterday morning when I breakfasted with Mrs M and for want of something so good of my own I read the whole of your letter to herbut this is not all for what  is more to the purpose that is to the purpose of your honour she desired to read it herself and then she entreated me not to delay the earliest opportunity to present  you  to her breakfasttable and the mistress of it to you I told her of the aukward distance of an hundred miles at least that lay between us but I promised and vowedfor I was obliged to do boththat the moment I could lay hold of your arm I would lead you to  her vestibule  I really begin to think I shall get some credit by you  Love I most readily acknowledge is subject to violent paroxysms as well as slow fevers but there is so much pleasure attendant upon the passion in general and so many amiable sympathies are connected with it nayit is sometimes so suddenly and oftentimes so easily cured that I cannot  for the life of me pity its disasters with the same tone of commiseration which accompanies my consolatory visits to other less oftensible sources of distressIn the last sad separation of friends  hope  comforts us with the prospect of an eternal reunion and  religion  encourages the belief of itbut in the melancholy history which you relate I behold what has always appeared to me to be the most affecting sight in the gloomy region of human misfortune I mean the pale countenance of one who has seen better days and sinks under the despair of seeing them return The mind that is bowed down by unmerited calamity and knows not from what point of the compass to expect any good is in a state over which the Angel of pity sheds all his showers  Unable to dig and to beg ashamed    what a descriptionwhat an object for reliefand how great the rapture to relieve it  I do not my dear boyindeed I do notenvy your feelings for I trust that I share them but if it were possible for me to envy you any thing that does you so much honour and makes me love you if possible so much better than I did beforeit is the little fabric of comfort and happiness which you have erected in the depths of misery The whole may occupy perhaps but little space in this worldbut like the mustard seed it will grow up and rear its head towards that Heaven to which the Spirit that planted it will finally conduct you  Robinson  called upon me yesterday to take me to dinner in  Berkeleysquare    and while I was arranging my drapery I gave him your letter to read He felt it as he ought and not only desired me to say every handsome thing on his part to you but he said a great many handsome things of you himself during dinner and after it and drank your health Nay as his wine warmed him he talked loud and threatened to drink waterlike youthe rest of his days  But while I am relating so many fine things to flatter  your vanity  let me I beseech you mention something to flatter my ownand this is neither more or less than a very elegant silver standish with a motto engraved upon it which has been sent me by  Lord Spencer  This mark of that Nobleman's good disposition towards  me was displayed in a manner which enhanced the value of the gift and heightened my sense of the obligation I could not thank him for it as I ought but I wrote my acknowledgements as well as I could and promised his Lordship that as it was a piece of plate the  Shandy  family would value the most it should certainly be the last they will part with  I had another little business to communicate to you but the postman's bell warns me to write adieuso God bless you and preserve you as you areand this wish by the bye is saying no small matter in your favour but it is addressed for and to you with the same truth that guides my pen in assuring you that I am most sincerely and cordially your faithful friend  L STERNE  LETTER XXXII To  Bond Street  THERE is a certain pliability of the affections my dear friend which with all its inconveniencesand I will acknowledge a thousandforms a wonderful charm in the human characterTo become a dupe to others who are almost always worse and very often more ignorant than yourself is not only mortifying to one's pride but frequently destructive to one's fortune Nevertheless there  is something in the very face and which is worse in the mind of suspicion of such a detestable complexion and character that I could never bear it and whenever I have observed mistrust in the heart I would never rap at the door of it even to pay if I could help it a morning visit much less to take my lodging there  Niger est hune tu Romane caveto  This sort of cullibility most certainly lays you open to the designs of knaves and rascals and they are alas to be found in the hedges and highway sides and will come in without the trouble of sending for themThe happy mean between mad goodnature and mean selflove is of difficult attainment though Mr Pope says  that  Lord Bathurst  possessed it in an eminent degreeand I believe it Indeed it is for my honour that I should believe it as I have received much kindness and many generous attentions from that venerable and excellent noblemanas I never possessed this happy quality myself I can only recommend it to you without offering any instructions on a duty of which I cannot offer myself as an exampleThis is not altogether clericalI mean as clergymen dobut no matter  B is exactly one of these harmless inoffensive people who never frets or fumes but bears all his losses with a most Christian patience and settles the account in this mannerthat he had rather lose any thing than that benevolence of disposition  which forms the happiness of his life But how will all this endfor you know as I know that when once you have won his good opinion you may impose upon him ten times a dayif nine did not suit your purpose The real friends of virtue of honour and what is best in the human character should form a phalanx round such a man and preserve him from the harpy plottings of sharpers and villains  But there is another species of cullibility that I never can be brought to pity which arises from the continual aim to make culls of others It is not that gentle confidential unsuspicious spirit which I have already hinted to you but an overweening wicked insidious disposition which by  being continually engaged in the miserable business of deceiving others either outwits itself or is outwitted by the very objects of its own fallacious intentions  There is not believe me a more straight way to the being a dupe yourself than the resting your hopes or pleasure  in making dupes of others  Cunning is not an honourable qualification it is a kind of lefthanded wisdom which even fools can sometimes practise and villains always make the foundation of their designsBut alas how often does it betray its votaries to their dishonour if not to their destruction  Though an occasional stratagem may be sometimes innocent I am ever disposed  to suspect the cause where it must be employed for after all you will I am sure agree with me that where artifice is not to be condemned  as a crime  the necessity which demands it must be considered  as a misfortune  I have been led to write thus  Socratically  from the tenor of your letter though if my paper would allow me I would take a frisk and vary the scene but I have only room to add that I dined in  Brookstreet  last Sunday where many gracious things were said of you not only by the old folks but which is better by the  young virgins  I went afterwards not much to my credit to  Argyle Buildings  but there were no virgins there So may God forgive me  and bless younow and at all timesAmen  I remain Most truly and cordially Your's L STERNE  LETTER XXXIII To  Coxwould  August  AMONG your Whimsicalities my dear friend for you have them as well as  Tristram  there is not one of them which possesses a more amiable tendency than that gentle spirit of modern Romance which hadst thou lived in days of Yore would have made thee the veriest Knight Errant that ever brandished a spear or wore a vizard  The very same spirit that has led thee from hence to the Bristol Fountain for no other earthly purpose but to let a Phthysical maiden lean upon thine arm and receive the healing waters from thine hand would in a former age have urged thee to traverse forests and fight with monsters for the sake of some  Dulcinea  whom thou hadst never seen or perhaps have made a  redcross  Knight of thee and carried thee over lands and seas to  Palestine    For to tell thee the truth enthusiasm is in the very soul of theeif thou wert born to live in some other planet I might encourage all its glowing highcoloured vulgaritiesbut in this miserable backbiting cheating pimping world of ours it will not doindeed indeed it will notAnd full well do I know nor does this  vaticination escape me without a sigh that it will lead thee into a thousand scrapesand some of them may be such as thou wilt not easily get out ofand should the fortunes of thine house be shaken by any of themwith all thy pleasant enjoymentswhat then you may say nay I think I hear you say sowhy thy friends will then lose th√©e  For if foul fortune should take thy stately palfrey with all its gay and gilded trappings from beneath thee or if while thou art sleeping by moonlight beneath a treeit should escape from thee and find another masteror if the miserable Banditti of the world should plunder theeI know full well that we should see thee no morefor thou wouldst then find out some  distant cell and become an Hermit and endeavour to persuade thyself not to regret the separation from those friends who will ever regret their separation from thee  This enthusiastic spirit is in itself a good spiritbut there is no spirit whateverno not a  termagant  spirit that requires a more active restraint or a more discreet regulation  And so we will go next spring if you please to the fountain of  Vauclusa  and think of  Petrarch  and which is better apostrophise his  Laura  By that time I have reason to think my wife will be there who by the bye is not  Laura  but my poor dear  Lydia  will be with her and she is more than a  Laura  to her fond father  Answer me on these things and may God bless you  I remain With the most cordial truth Your affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XXXIV To  Sunday Evening  THERE is a certain kind of offence which a man maynay which he ought to forgiveBut such is the jealous honour of the world that there is a sort of injury commonly called an affront which if it proceeds from a certain line of character must be revengedBut let me entreat thee to remember that hardness of heart is not worth thine anger and would  disgrace thy vengeanceTo turn upon a man who possesses it would not like  Saint Paul  be kicking against the pricksbut which is far worse against a flintThou didst right therefore my dear boyin letting the matter pass as thou hast done  As far as my observation has reached and the circle of it is by no means a narrow onean hard heart is always a cowardly heartGenerosity and courage are associate virtues and the character which possesses the former must in the nature of mental arrangements be adorned with the latter  If I perceive a man to be capable of doing a mean actionif I see him imperious and tyrannical if he takes advantage of  the weak to oppress or of the poor to grind or of the downcast to insultor is continually on the hunt after excuses not to do what he oughtI determine such a man though he may have fought fifty duels to be a cowardIt is by no means a proof that a man is brave because he does not refuse to fightfor we all know that cowards have fought naythat cowards have conqueredbut a coward never performed a generous or a noble actionand thou hast my authority to sayand thou mightest find a worse that a hardhearted character never was a brave one I say thou mayst justly call such a man a cowardand if he should be spirited into a resentment of thy wordsfear him not  Tristram  shall brighten his armour and scour the rust from off his spear and aid thee in the combat  And now let me ask thee my good friend how it happens that thy fancy has of late taken to the DormitoryI thought the very names of  Petrarch  and  Laura  and the enchanting scene of  Vauclusa's  fountain which is such a classical spot to all tender minds must have inspired thee with a flow of sentiment that would have meandered through every page of thy last letterbut instead of it here have I been saluted with a string of stiff starched notions of honour and God knows whatthat you could have found no where but in conversing with the young Lords in great periwigsand the old Ladies in bouncing fardingalswho have so long inhabited's long long Gallery  However when you are tired of such company and stalking about upon a matted  floor you may come here and contemplate the Autumn leaf and relax yourself with looking at me while I prepare another volume or two to lessen the spleen of a splenetic worldFor with all its faults I am willing to do it that good at leastif it will let meand if it will notI shall leave you to pity it So fare thee welland God bless you  I remain Thine most affectionate L STERNE  LETTER XXXV To Lady C H  Saturday Noon  HERE am I now actually at my writing tableshall I divulge the secretin something between the fortieth and fortyfifth year of my lifeI shall leave your Ladyship if you please to imagine all the restand in this advancing state of my age am I to address myself to all those charms which are composed by the happiest combination of youth and beauty  But if you should consider this as a presumption I will quit those beauties which belong only to early life and make my application to qualities which are of every period and possess that lengthened charm which makes one overlook the wrinkles of age and turns the hoary hair into Auburn Tresses That you will always possess the one as you now do the other I have heard acknowledged wherever I have heard your name mentioned nor do I remember that your praise was ever accompanied with the exception of a single  but  from any of the many various forms and shapes which envy plants in every corner to snarl at excellence  But while your Ladyship by a kind of miraculous power can subdue envy with  respect to yourselfyou many sometimes without meaning it encourage its attacks upon othersFor my part nothing can be more certain than that I shall be envied with a vengeance when it is known with what a gracious condescension you have indulged my request but envy on such an occasion will add to my laurels instead of withering themit is like the scar of glory and I am as proud of the one as the patriot hero has reason to be of the other  To confine myself however to the purpose of this paper  Permit me to thank your Ladyship most cordially for permiting me to solicit the honour of your protectionas for attempting  to thank you for having granted it that is not in my power both my pen and my lips find it impossible to obey the impulse of my heart on the occasionPerhaps the time may come when some of the  Shandy  family may possess a sufficient eloquence to offer you that homage which is very devoutly felt but cannot be adequately expressedindeed it cannot by  Your Ladyship's most faithful and obedient humble servant L STERNE  LETTER XXXVI To  Wednesdaypast at Night  and not very well  THAT woman is a timid animal I am most ready my dear friend to acknowledgebut like other timid animals is more dangerous in certain situations than those who possess a greater degree of natural courageI would therefore counse thee for this among a thousand other reasons never to make a woman thine enemy if thou canst possibly help itNot that  I suspect thee to be capible of an uncourteous act to any of the lovelier sexon the contrary I think thee qualified and disposed too beyond most men I ever knew to charm them and do them good and it is perhaps on that as much as any other account that I warn thee against giving them offenceFor I have more than once observed and mentioned with some concern a propensity in thy character to collect thy warm affections in one particular circle and to be careless of which as it relates to women is the same thing as to be ungracious to those who are not included in it  There is something amiablenay there may be something noble in the principle of such a conduct but it is too refined for  a world like our's in which short as life is we may easily live long enough to find the inconvenience and distress of it He who attaches himself entirely to one objector even to a fewmay from ingratitude caprice or death be soon left alone and he will come with an illgrace when necessity compels him to seek for kindness and society where he formerly appeared to disdain both  If a small cohort of friends could be certain of continuing together till they all sunk into one common grave your present theory might form not only a gallant and a pleasant but a practicable system this however my dear fellow cannot be and as for living alone when all our friends are gone it is neither more or less than making life a living tomb  which in my mind is farfar worse than a dead one  But to return to my subject  Woman is a timid animaland therefore I trust and am sure thy generous nature laying aside every other consideration will never do any thing designedly to distress itIndeed it does not appear to me that there can be a possible situation which will justify any kind of inattention to the sex that may give them painFor be assured and I will rest my experience of woman kind of which I am not a little proud on the opinion that the passion for any individual of the sex whatever her perfections may be which makes thee relax in thy gracious behaviour to the rest will  never promote thy real happinessit may afford thee a certain season though I believe a very short one of tumultuous rapture and then thou wilt awake from thy delirium to all the grievances of a fretful spirit  Women look at least for attentionsthey consider them as an inherent birthright given to their sex by the laws of polished society and when they are deprived of them they most certainly have a right to complainand will be one and all disposed to practise that revenge which is not by any means to be treated with contempt It would be very unpleasant for me to hear in any female society that my friend was a strange eccentric singular unpleasant characterand I rather think that he himself would not be pleased to find  that such a description was given and believed of himI do not mean to urgeindeed I well know you cannot suspect me of so gross an errorthat the same regard is to be equally dealt to all this is far from being my system  but I affirm on the other handthat all are not to be disregarded for one  for it will seldom happen that the affection of that one will recompense thee for the enmity of all the restLove one if you please and as much as you pleasebut be gracious to all  Affection may surely conduct thee through an avenue of women to her who possesses thy heart without tearing the flounces of any of their petticoats The displaying courtesy to all whom you meet will delay you very little in your way to  the arms of her whom you loveand if I mistake not will attune your sensibilities to the higher enjoyment of the raptures you will find there  We have all of us enemies enough my good friend from the inevitable course of human events without our encreasing the number by so strange and unprofitable conduct as that of neglecting any of the most trifling offices of familiar life  Besidesto come more home to thine heartlet me observe to theethat charity and humanity which by the bye are one and the same thing are said to be the foundation of those qualities which form what is called a wellbred manIf therefore you should on any account  get into the habit of neglecting the latteryou may stand more than a chance of its being said that you do not possess the former which you know to be the brightest jewel in the human characterAnd this I am certain would wound thee in thy very soul  My dear boy neglect not these and other things which thou mayst call little thingsfor little things believe me are oftentimes of great importance in the arrangements of life  You have been frequently pleased to tell me as a matter of praise that in my descriptions I am natural to a nicetyand when I tell of picking up an handkerchief or wiping a tear from the cheek  of a distressed damsel with a white oneor the sticking a pin into a pincushionand such things I am far superior to any other writerApply then I beseech thee this observation to thyself and give me an opportunity of retorting the eulogium upon thee This is the sincere wish of thy friend  So may God bless thee and direct the best feelings of thy heart to the best purposes of thy life  I am Your's most affectionately L STERNE  The postman's bell tells me I have not time to read what I have written but I will trust to both our hearts that there is nothing which either ought to be ashamed of  LETTER XXXVII To MRS V  Monday Morn  WHEN all the croud my fair lady was hurried into the gardens to hear the musick of squibs and crackersand to see the air illuminated by rockets and balloonsI was flattered exquisitely flattered to find you contented to saunter lackadaysically with me round an exhausted Ranelagh and give me your gentle amiable elegant sentiments in a tone of voice that was originally intended for a Cherub How you got it I know notnor is it my business to enquire I am ever  rejoiced to find any emanation of the other world in any corner of this be it where it maybut particularly when it proceeds through any female organwhere the effect must be more powerful because it is always most delicious  Now after this little emanation of my spirit which may not be quite so celestial as it ought I trust you will not think me ungracious in desiring you to excuse my promised duties at your drawingroom this evening The truth ismy cough has seized me so violently by the throat that though I could hear you sing I should not be able to tell you the effects of your music upon my heart IndeedI can scarce produce a whisper loud enough to make the servant bring my gruel  I have now been so long acquainted with this crazy frame of mine that I know all its tricksand I foresee that I have a week's indulgence at least to bestow upon itHowever on Sunday next I trustI may becassock myself in my cloak and be chaired to your warm cabinet where I hope to possess voice enough to assure you of the sincere esteem and admiration I feel for youwhether I can tell you so or no Colds and coughs and catarrhs may tie up the tongue but the heart is above the little inconveniences of its prisonhouse and will one day escape from them all 'Till that period I shall beg leave to remain with great truth  Your most faithful And obedient humble servant L STERNE  LETTER XXXVIII To  Sunday Evening  THE poor in spirit and the poor in purse with nine out of tennay with ninetynine in an hundred of the world are so alike that by practising the virtues of the former a man generally gets all the credit or rather discredit of the latter  Here are very few my friend who have that nice insight into characters as to be able to discern the various but approaching shades that distinguish them from  each otherand sorry am I to say it but there are still fewer who have the humanity to make them employ their discernment where it ought to be employed in favour of the heart  This moderation of temper which is always associated to sterling merit is made to win the love of the few but is too apt at the same time to be not only the dupe but the contempt of the many He who comes not forward with his pretensions is either supposed to possess noneor to be prevented by some awkward or disgraceful circumstances from offering themThe ignorant the upstart and the assuming will not be made to believe that the humble can have meritAs they themselves wear the tinsel suit of tawdry qualifications upon their backs they look  no further for the qualities of othersWhich by the bye is natural enough  The wicked and the knavish will not suppose that a man on the score of conscience or virtue can be such an idiot as to practise submission and keep back brilliant talents from exercise because he cannot enlist them in an honest causeor that when he is employing them in an humble wayit is not with some design of artifice or from some motive that is baseso that the modest diffident and Christian character stands but little chance of what is called good fortune in the worldIndeed Christianly speaking there is no great promise made to it in this petty circle of timeSuch virtues are to look to more durable honours when this world is faded awayand it is their consolation  and their delight here that such a reward awaits them Alaswithout this hope how could the good bear as they do the thousand untoward circumstances that are continually pressing upon themand chasing away the smile from the cheeks and placing tears in their stead  But I am interruptedor I believeinstead of a letteryou would have had a sermon but it is Sunday eveningand therefore witha God bless youI conclude myself  Your affectionateL STERNE  LETTER XXXIX To  Saturday Evening  I HAVE had my friend another attack and though I am in a great measure recovered it has hinted to me one thing at least which isthat if I am rash enough to risk the Winter in London I shall never see another Spring  In the very beginning of the following Spring he died at his lodgings in Bondstreet  But be that as it mayas my family is now in England and as I have my sentimental journeywhich I think with you will be the most popular of my works to  give to the worldI know not how it will be possible for me to run so counter to my interest my affections and my vanityas to set my face southward before Marchand I think if I get to that period I may bid the scarecrow defiance for another seven or eight monthsand then I may leave him in the fogs and go where as he so often followed me in vain he will not follow me again And this idea cheers my spiritnot believe me that I am uneasy about death as deathbut that I think for a dozen years to comeI could make a very tolerable good use of life  But be that as it pleases God  Besides I have promised yourand sure I may add my charming friend Mrs Vto pay her a visit in IrelandwhichI mean that you should do with me  It is not that you introduced me to her acquaintancewhich is something it is not her enchanting voice which humanly speaking may be morenor that she has come herself in the form of a pitying angel and made my Tisan for me during my illnessand played at picquet with me in order to prevent my attempt to talk as she was told it would do me harmwhich is most of allthat makes me love her so much as I dobut it is a mind attuned to every virtue and a nature of the first orderbeaming through a form of the first beauty In my life did I never see any thingso truely graceful as she is nor had I an idea 'till I saw herthat grace could be so perfect in all its parts and so suited to all the higher ordinances of the first life from the superintending impulse of the mind For I will answer for it that education  though called forth to the utmost exertions has played a very subordinate part in the composition of her character All its best efforts areas it werein the back ground or rather are lost in the general mass of those qualities which predominate over all her accessory accomplishments  In short if I had ever so great an inclination to cross the gulph while such a woman beckoned me to stayI could not depart  The world however has absolutely killed me and should such a report have reached you I know full well that it would have grieved you sorelyand I wish you not to shed a tear for me in vainThat you will drop more than one over  thy friend Yorick when he is dead sooths him while he is yet alivebut I trust that though there may be something in my death whenever it happensto distress you there will be something also in the remembrance of me to comfort you when I am laid beneath the marble  But why do I talk of marbleI should say beneath the sod  For cover my head with a turf or a stone  'Twill be all one  'Twill be all one  Till then at least I shall be with great truth  Your most affectionate L STERNE  FINIS
