 AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF  John Philip Barretier  Who was Master of Five LANGUAGES at the Age of Nine YEARS  Compiled from his Father's LETTERS  c  LONDON  Printed for  J Roberts  in  Warwicklane  Price Sixpence  Just Published  AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF Mr RICHARD SAVAGE Son of the Earl RIVERS  From the  CHAMPION February  This Pamphlet is without Flattery to its Author as just and well written a Piece as of its King I ever saw so that at the same Time that it highly deserves it certainly stands very little in need of this RecommendationAs to the History of the unfortunate Person who  e Memoirs compose this Work it is certainly penned with equal Accuracy and Spirit of which I am so much the better Judge as I know many of the Facts mentioned in it to be strictly true and very fairly related Besides it is not only the Story of Mr  Savage  but innumerable Incidents relating to other Persons and other Affairs which render this a very amusing and withal a very instructive and valuable PerformanceThe Author's Observations are short significant and just as his Narrative is remarkably smooth and well disposed His Reflections open to us all the Recesses of the human Heart and in a Word a more just or pleasant a more engaging or a more improving Treatise on the Excellencies and Defects of human Nature is scarce to be found in our own or perhaps in any other Language  LONDON  Printed for  J Roberts  in  Warwicklane    AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF  JOHN PHILIP BARRETIER  Compiled from his Father's LETTERS  c  _JOHN PHILIP BARRETIER  was born at  Schwabach Jan    His Father was  Francis Barretier  Pastor of the  Calvinist  Church of that Place who took upon himself the Care of his Education for which he formed a Scheme that seems to be sufficiently vindicated by its Success from the Censures to which new Attempts are generally exposed and therefore requires a very particular Account for if M  Le Fevre  thought  the Method in which he taught his Children worthy to be communicated to the learned World how justly may M  Barretier  claim the universal Attention of Mankind to this new Scheme that has produced such a stupendous Progress The Authors who have endeavoured to teach Rules for obtaining a long Life however they have failed in their Attempts are universally confessed to have at least the Merit of a great and noble Design and to have deserved Gratitude and Honour How much more then is due to M  Barretier  who has succeeded in what they have only attempted For to prolong Life and improve it are nearly the same If to have all that Riches can purchase is to be rich to do all that can be done in a long Time is to live long and he is equally a Benefactor to Mankind who teaches them to protract the Duration or shorten the Business of Life  That there are therefore few Things more worthy our Curiosity than this Method by which the Father assisted the Genius of the Son every Man will be convinced who shall hear the early Proficiency at which it enabled him to arrive such as no one has yet reached at the same Age and to which it is therefore probable that every advantageous Circumstance concurred  French  which was the native Language of his Mother was that which he learned first mixed by living in  Germany  with some Words of the Language of the Country After some Time his Father took Care to introduce in his Conversation with him some Words of  Latin  in such a Manner that he might discover the Meaning of them by the Connexion of the Sentence or the Occasion on which they were used without observing that he had any Intention of instructing him or that any new Attainment was proposed  By this Method of Conversation in which new Words were every Day introduced when his Ear had been somewhat accustomed to the Inflections and Variations of the  Latin  Tongue he began to attempt to speak like his Father and was in a short Time drawn on by imperceptible Degrees to speak  Latin  intermixed with any other Language  Thus when he was but four Years old he spoke every Day  French  to his Mother  Latin  to his Father and  High Dutch  to the Maid without any Perplexity to himself or any Confusion of one Language with another  While he was thus learning Languages without Study and almost without perceiving that he was learning his Father took care to teach him to read and write of which he perform'd  one without Books and the other without Paper but by what Methods we are not informed It is indeed easy to conceive many that might be used nor does it seem with respect to the Art of Writing of any Importance whether he made his first Essays with Paper or any other Materials as the Operation must be nearly the same These Methods whatever they were succeeded so well that he was able to read currently at the Age of three Years and soon after was taught to write  When he had thus learned to read his Father put some Books into his Hands chiefly such as were filled with Pictures accompanied with Explanations With these the young Student was wonderfully delighted when he perceived says the Author of his Life that they talked and reasoned like himself and from that Time might be dated his wonderful Fondness for Books which became greater every Day  The other Languages of which he was Master he learned by a Method yet more uncommon The only Book that he made use of was the Bible which his Father laid before him in the Language he then proposed to learn accompanied with a Translation being taught by Degrees the Inflections of Nouns and Verbs This Method says his  Father made the  Latin  more familiar to him in his fourth Year than any other Language  When he was near the End of his sixth Year he entered upon the Study of the Old Testament in its original Language beginning with the Book of  Genesis  to which his Father confined him for six Months after which he read cursorily over the rest of the Historical Books in which he found very little Difficulty and then applied himself to the Study of the poetical Writers and the Prophets which he read over so often with so close an Attention and so happy a Memory that he could not only translate them without a Moment's Hesitation into  Latin  or  French  but turn with the same Facility the Translations into the original Language in his tenth Year  When he was only eight Years old he could repeat not only all the Psalms in  Hebrew  but all that Collection of Texts which  Henricus Opitius  has published under the Title of  Biblia Parva  this Collection he transcribed and added to it a new Translation He drew up likewise in Pages in  Quarto  a Dictionary of the most rare and difficult Words of the  Hebrew  Language in which be interspersed a great Number of curious Remarks and critical Observations  Having now gained such a Degree of Skill in the  Hebrew  Language as to be able to compose in it both in Prose and Verse he was extremely desirous of reading the  Rabbins  and having borrowed of the neighbouring Clergy and the Jews of  Schwabach  all the Books with which they could supply him he prevailed on his Father to buy him the great  Rabinical  Bible published at  Amsterdam  in  Tomes  Folio and read it with that Accuracy and Attention which appears by the Account of it written by him to his Favourite M  Le Maitre  inserted in the Beginning of the th Volume of the  Bibliotheque Germanique  These Writers were read by him as other young Persons peruse Romances or Novels only from a puerile Desire of Amusement for he had so little Veneration for them even while he studied them with most Eagerness that he often diverted his Parents with recounting their Fables and Chimeras  At the Age of nine Years he not only was Master of five Languages an Attainment in itself almost incredible but understood says his  In a Letter which was communicated to the Author of this Account  Father the holy Writers better in their original Tongues than in his own If he means by this Assertion that he knew the Sense of many Passages in the Original which were  obscure in the Translation the Account however wonderful may be admitted but if he intends to tell his Correspondent that his Son was better acquainted with the two Languages of the Bible than with his own he must be supposed to speak hyperbolically or to admit that his Son had somewhat neglected the Study of his native Language Or we must own that the Fondness of a Parent has transported him into some natural Exaggerations  Part of this Letter I am tempted to suppress being unwilling to demand the Belief of others to that which appears incredible to myself but as my Incredulity may perhaps be the Product rather of Prejudice than Reason as Envy may beget a Disinclination to admit so immense a Superiority and as an Account is not to be immediately censured as false merely because it is wonderful I shall proceed to give the rest of his Father's Relation from his Letter of the d of  March  He speaks continues he  German Latin  and  French  equally well He can by laying before him a Translation read any of the Books of the Old or New Testament in its original Language without Hesitation or Perplexity He is no Stranger to Biblical Criticism or Philosophy nor unacquainted with antient or modern Geography and is  qualified to support a Conversation with learned Men who frequently visit and correspond with him  In his eleventh Year he not only published a learned Letter in  Latin  but translated the Travels of  Rabbi Benjamin  from the  Hebrew  into  French  which he illustrated with Notes and accompanied with Dissertations a Work in which his Father as he himself declares could give him little Assistance as he did not understand the Rabbinical Dialect  The Reason for which his Father engaged him in this Work was only to prevail upon him to write a fairer Hand than he had hitherto accustomed himself to do by giving him Hopes that if he should translate some little Author and offer a fair Copy of his Version to some Bookseller he might in Return for it have other Books which he wanted and could not afford to purchase  Incited by this Expectation he fixed upon the  Travels of Rabbi Benjamin  as most proper for his Purpose being a Book neither bulky nor common and in one Month compleated his Translation applying only one or two Hours a Day to that particular Task In another Month he drew up the principal Notes and in the third wrote some Dissertations  upon particular Passages which seemed to require a larger Examination  These Notes contain so many curious Remarks and Enquiries out of the common Road of Learning and afford so many Instances of Penetration Judgment and Accuracy that the Reader finds in every Page some Reason to persuade him that they cannot possibly be the Work of a Child but of a Man long accustomed to these Studies enlightened by Reflection and dextrous by long Practice in the Use of Books Yet that it is the Performance of a Boy thus young is not only proved by the Testimony of his Father but by the concurrent Evidence of M  Le Maitre  his Associate in the Church of  Schwobach  who not only asserts his Claim to this Work but affirms that he heard him at six Years of Age explain the  Hebrew  Text as if it had been his native Language so that the Fact is not to be doubted without a Degree of Incredulity which it will not be very easy to defend  This Copy was however far from being written with the Neatness which his Father desired nor did the Booksellers to whom it was offered make Proposals agreeable to the Expectation of the young Translator but after having examined the Performance in their  ner and determined to print it upon Conditions not very advantageous returned it to be transcribed that the Printers might not be embarrassed with a Copy so difficult to read  Barretier  was now advanced to the latter End of his twelfth Year and had made great Advances in his Studies notwithstanding an obstinate Tumour in his left Hand which gave him great Pain and obliged him to a tedious and troublesome Method of Cure and reading over his Performance was so far from contenting himself with barely transcribing it that he altered the greatest Part of the Notes newmodelled the Differtations and augmented the Book to twice its former Bulk  What Applauses are due to an old Age wasted in a scrupulous Attention to Particles Accents and Etymologies may appear says his Father by seeing how little Time is required to arrive at such an Eminence in these Studies as many even of these venerable Doctors have not attained for want of rational Methods and regular Application  This Censure is doubtless just upon those who spend too much of their Lives upon useless Niceties or who appear to labour without making any Progress But as the Knowledge of Languages is necessary and a minute Accuracy sometimes requisite they are by no Means to be blamed who in Compliance  with the particular Benefit of their own Minds make the Difficulties of dead Languages their chief Study and arrive at Excellence proportionate to their Application since it was to the Labour of such Men that his Son was indebted for his own Learning  Thus he continued his Studies neither drawn aside by Pleasures nor discouraged by Difficulties The greatest Obstacle to his Improvement was want of Books with which his narrow Fortune could not liberally supply him so that he was obliged to borrow the greatest Part of those which his Studies required and to return them when he had read them without being able to consult them occasionally or to recur to them when his Memory should fail him  It is observable that neither his Diligence unintermitted as it was nor his Want of Books a Want of which he was in the highest Degree sensible ever produced in him that Asperity which a long and recluse Life without any Circumstance of Disquiet frequently create He was always gay lively and facetious a Temper which contributed much to recommend his Learning and of which some Students much superior in Age would consult their Ease their Reputation and their Interest by copying from him  His Father being somewhat uneasy to observe so much Time spent by him on Rabinical Trifles thought it necessary now to recall him to the Study of the  Greek  Language which he had of late neglected but to which he returned with so much Ardour that in a short Time he was able to read  Greek  with the same Facility as  French  or  Latin  In his twelfth Year he applied more particularly to the Study of the Fathers and Councils of the first six Centuries and began to make a regular Collection of their Canons He read every Author in the Original having discovered so much Negligence or Ignorance in most Translations that he paid no Regard to their Authority  Soon after he undertook at his Father's Desire to confute a Treatise of  Samuel Crellius  in which under the Name of  Artemonius  he has endeavoured to substitute in the Beginning of St  John  's Gospel a Reading different from that which is at present received and less favourable to the orthodox Doctrine of the Divinity of our Saviour  This Task was undertaken by  Barretier  with great Ardour and prosecuted by him with suitable Application for he not only drew up a formal Confutation of  Artemonius  but made large Collections from the earliest  Writers relating to the History of Heresies which he proposed at first to have published as Preliminaries to his Book but finding the Introduction grew at last to a greater Bulk than the Book itself he determined to print it apart  While he was engrossed by these Enquiries Accident threw a Pair of Globes into his Hands in  Oct  by which his Curiosity was so much exalted that he laid aside his  Artemonius  and applied himself to Geography and Astronomy In ten Days he was able to solve all the Problems in the Doctrine of the Globes and had attained Ideas so clear and strong of all the Systems as well ancient as modern that he began to think of making new Discoveries and for that Purpose laying aside for a Time all Searches into Antiquity he employed his utmost Interest to procure Books of Astronomy and of Mathematicks and made such a Progress in three or four Months that he seemed to have spent his whole Life upon that Study for he not only made an Astrolabe and drew up astronomical Tables but invented new Methods of Calculation or such at least as appeared new to him because they were not mentioned in the Books which he had then an Opportunity of Reading and it is a sufficient Proof both of  the Rapidity of his Progress and the Extent of his Views that in three Months after his first Sight of a Pair of Globes he formed Schemes for finding the Longitude which he sent in  Jan  to the Royal Society at  London  His Scheme being recommended to the Society by the Queen was considered by them with a Degree of Attention which perhaps would not have been bestowed upon the Attempt of a Mathematician so young had he not been dignified with so illustrious a Patronage But it was soon found that for want of Books he had imagined himself the Inventor of Methods already in common Use and that he proposed no Means of discovering the Longitude but such as had been already tried and found insufficient Such will be very frequently the Fate of those whose Fortune either condemns them to study without the necessary Assistance from Libraries or who in too much Haste publish their Discoveries  This Attempt exhibited however such a Specimen of his Capacity for mathematical Learning and such a Proof of an early Proficiency that in the Royal Society of  Berlin  admitted him as one of their Members  Notwithstanding these Avocations and Amusements he published in AntiArtemonius  seu Initium Evangelii S Johannis Apostoli adversus iniquissimam  L M Artemonij  NeoPhotiniani Criticam vindicatum atq illustratum quâ Occasione etiam multa alia S Scripturae Veterumque Loca vindicantur et multis Antiquitatis Monumentis Lux affunditur cui in Fine accedit Dissertatio de Dialogis tribus  Theodoreto  vulgo tributis  Auctore  J P Barreterio SS Theologiae  aliarumque bonarum Artium Cultore  Norimbergae  vo  This Work is divided into five Parts In the first of which  Barretier  proves that the Text was always read as it now stands In the Second he shews that  Artemonius  's Notion of the Method by which it was changed is groundless In the Third he examines the internal Evidence brought by  Artemonius  to prove that St  John  could not write the Words as they are now read In the Fourth he refutes the Opinion of  Socinus  that St  John  saying that  by the Word all Things were made  speaks of a new Creation In the Fifth he proves the Divinity of our Saviour from other Parts of the holy Writings and concludes with a Paraphrase of the first Verses of St  John  's Gospel To the whole is added an  Essay to prove that the Dialogues ascribed to  Theodoret  are the Work of another Writer  He had now attained such a Degree of Reputation that not only the Public but Princes who are commonly the last by whom Merit is distinguished began to interest themselves in his Success for the same Year the King of  Prussia  who had heard of his early Advances in Literature on Account of a Scheme for discovering the Longitude which had been sent to the Royal Society of  Berlin  and which was transmitted afterwards by him to  Paris  and  London  engaged to take care of his Fortune having received further Proofs of his Abilities at his own Court to which he was introduced in the following Manner  M  Barretier  being promoted to the Cure of the Church of  Stetin  was obliged to travel with his Son thither from  Schwobach  thro'  Leipsic  and  Berlin  a Journey very agreaable to his Son as it would furnish him with new Opportunities of improving his Knowledge and extending his Acquaintance among Men of Letters For this Purpose they staid some time at  Leipsic  and then travelled to  Hall  where young  Barretier  so distinguished himself in his Conversation with the Professors of the University that they offered him his Degree of Doctor in Philosophy a Dignity correspondent  to that of Master of Arts among us  Barretier  drew up that Night fourteen Positions in Philosophy and the Mathematicks which he sent immediately to the Press and defended the next Day in a crowded Auditory with so much Wit Spirit Presence of Thought and Strength of Reason that the whole University was delighted and amaz'd he was then admitted to his Degree and attended by the whole Concourse to his Lodgings with Compliments and Acclamations  His  Theses  or philosophical Positions which he printed in Compliance with the Practice of that University ran through several Editions in a few Weeks and no Testimony of Regard was wanting that could contribute to animate him in his Progress  When they arrived at  Berlin  the King ordered him to be brought into his Presence and was so much pleased with his Conversation that he sent for him almost every Day during his stay at  Berlin  and diverted himself with engaging him in Conversations on a Multitude of Subjects and in Disputes with learned Men on all which Occasions he acquitted himself so happily that the King formed the highest Ideas of his Capacity and future Eminence And thinking perhaps with Reason that active Life was the noblest  Sphere of a great Genius he recommended to him the Study of Modern History the Customs of Nations and those Parts of Learning that are of Use in publick Transactions and civil Employments declaring that such Abilities properly cultivated might exalt him in ten Years to be the greatest Minister of State in  Europe Barretier  whether we attribute it to his Moderation or Inexperience was not dazzled by the Prospect of such high Promotion but answered that he was too much pleased with Science and Quiet to leave them for such inextricable Studies or such harrassing Fatigues A Resolution so unpleasing to the King that his Father attributes to it the Delay of those Favours which they had Hopes of receiving the King having as he observes determined to employ him in the Ministry  The Science that withheld him from complying with such flattering Proposals was Astronomy which was always his Favourite Study and so much engrossed his Thoughts that he did not willingly converse on any other Subject nor was he so well pleased with the Civilities of the greatest Persons as with the Conversation of the Mathematicians An Astronomical Observation was sufficient to withhold him from  Court or to call him away abruptly from the most illustrious Assemblies none could hope to enjoy his Company long without inviting some Professor to keep him in Temper and engage him in Discourse nor was it possible without this Expedient to prevail upon him to sit for his Picture  It is not unlikely that paternal Affection might suggest to M  Barretier  some false Conceptions of the King's Designs for he infers from the Introduction of his Son to the young Princes and the Caresses which he received from them that the King intended him for their Preceptor a Scheme says he which some other Resolution happily destroyed  Whatever was originally intended and by whatever Means these Intentions were frustrated  Barretier  after having been treated with the highest Regard by the whole Royal Family was dismissed with a Present of two hundred Crowns and his Father instead of being fixed at  Stetin  was made Pastor of the  French  Church at  Hall  a Place more commodious for Study to which they retired  Barretier  being recommended by the King to the University  As the Scene of M  Barretier  's Life was now changed it seems not improper to recur to some of the former Parts of it and to recount some Honours conferred upon him which if Distinctions are to be rated by the Knowledge of those who bestow them may be considered as more valuable than those which he received from Princes  In  June  He was initiated in the University of  Altdorft  and at the End of the Year the Synod of the Reformed Churches held at  Christian Erlang  admitted him to be present at their Consultations and to preserve the Memory of so extraordinary a Transaction as the Reception of a Boy of eleven Years into an Ecclesiastical Council recorded it in a particular Article of the Acts of the Synod  Barretier  had been distinguished much more early by the Margravine of  Anspach  who in sent for his Father and Mother to the Court where their Son whom they carried with them presented her with a Letter in  French  and addressed another in  Latin  to the young Prince who afterwards in granted him the Privilege of borrowing Books from the Libraries of  Anspach  together with an annual Pension of fifty Florins which he enjoyed for four Years  M  Barretier  returned on the th of  April  to  Hall  where he continued the remaining Part of his Life of which it may not be improper to give a more particular Account  At his Settlement in the University he determined to exert his Privileges as Master of Arts and to read publick Lectures to the Students a Design from which his Father could not dissuade him tho' he did not approve it so certainly do Honours or Preferments too soon conferred infatuate the greatest Capacities He published an Invitation to three Lectures one Critical on the Book of  Job  another on Astronomy and a third upon ancient Ecclesiastical History But of this Employment he was soon made weary by the Petulance of his Auditors the Fatigue which it occasioned and the Interruption of his Studies which it produced and therefore in a Fortnight he desisted wholly from his Lectures and never afterwards resumed them  He then applied himself to the Study of the Law almost against his own Inclination which however he conquered so far as to become a regular Attendant on the Lectures in that Faculty but spent all his other Time upon different Studies  The first Year of his Residence at  Hall  was spent upon Natural Philosophy and Mathematicks and scarcely any Author ancient or modern that has treated on those Parts of Learning was neglected by him nor was he satisfied with the Knowledge of what had been discovered by others but made new Observations and drew up immense Calculations for his own Use  He then returned to Ecclesiastical History and began to retouch his  Account of Heresies  which he had begun at  Schwobach  on this Occasion he read the Primitive Writers with great Accuracy and formed a Project of regulating the Chronology of those Ages which produced a  Chronological Dissertation on the Succession of the Bishops of  Rome  from St  Peter  to  Victor printed in  Latin  at  Utrecht    He afterwards was wholly absorbed in Application to polite Literature and read not only a Multitude of Writers in the  Greek  and  Latin  but in the  German Dutch French Italian English  and  Arabick  Languages and in the last Year of his Life he was engrossed by the Study of Inscriptions Medals and Antiquities of all Nations  In he resumed his Design of finding a certain Method of discovering the Longitude which he imagined himself to have attained by exact Observations of the Declination and Inclination of the Needle and sent to the Academy of Sciences and to the Royal Society of  London  at the same Time an Account of his Schemes to which it was first answered by the Royal Society that it appear'd the same with one that Mr  Whiston  had laid before them and afterwards by the Academy of Sciences that his Method was but very little different from one that had been proposed by M  de la Croix  and which was ingenious but ineffectual  M  Barretier  finding his Invention already in the Possession of two Men eminent for mathematical Knowledge desisted from all Enquiries after the Longitude and engaged in an Examination of the  Egyptian  Antiquities which he proposed to free from their present Obscurity by deciphering their Hierogliphicks and explaining their Astronomy but this Design was interrupted by his Death  This Design he had proposed to himself to execute in such a Manner as should establish his Reputation and indeed it appears from the Scheme which he sent to M  Le  Maitre  De Doctrina Temporum secundum Rationes priscorum Aegyptiorum Libri V  Primus De Anni forma apud Aegyptios agit Ibi de variis eorum

finish it he has not left such Materials as might enable others to  persue his Ideas It is indeed not to be related without some Degree of Wonder that there were found in his Collections but a few Sheets relating to this great Work for which he informs his Friend that he has collected all the Materials and declares that the greatest Part of the Labour being performed he shall be able to write it without any Impediment  He continued to add new Acquisitions to his Learning and to encrease his Reputation by new Performances till in the Beginning of his nineteenth Year his Health began to decline and his Indisposition which being not alarming or violent was perhaps not at first sufficiently regarded increased by slow  Degrees for eighteen Months during which he spent Days among his Books and neither neglected his Studies nor lost his Gaiety till his Distemper ten Days before his Death deprived him of the Use of his Limbs he then prepared himself for his End without Fear or Emotion and on the th of  October  resigned his Soul into the Hands of his Saviour with Confidence and Tranquillity  Thus died  Barretier  in the th Year of his Age having given a Proof how much may be performed in so short a Time by indefatigable Diligence He was not only Master of many Languages but skilled almost in every Science and capable of distinguishing himself in every Profession except that of Physick from which he had been discouraged by remarking the Diversity of Opinions among those who had been consulted concerning his own Disorders  His Learning however vast had not depressed or overburthen'd his natural Faculties for his Genius appeared always predominant and when he enquired into the various Opinions of the Writers of all Ages he reasoned and determined for himself having a Mind at once comprehensive and delicate active and attentive He was able to reason with the Metaphysicians on the most abstruse  Questions or to enliven the most unpleasing Subjects by the Gaiety of his Fancy He wrote with great Elegance and Dignity of Stile and had the peculiar Felicity of Readiness and Facility in every Thing that he undertook being able without Premeditation to translate one Language into another He was no Imitator but struck out new Tracts and formed original Systems He had a Quickness of Apprehension and Firmness of Memory which enabled him to read with incredible Rapidity and at the same Time to retain what he had read so as to be able to recollect and apply it He turned over Volumes in an Instant and selected what was useful for his Purpose He seldom made Extracts except of Books which he could not procure when he might want them a second Time being always able to find in any Author with great Expedition what he had once read He read over in one Winter twenty vast Folio's and the catalogue of Books which he had borrow'd comprised Pages in Quarto the Writing close and the Titles abridged He was a constant Reader of Literary Journals  With regard to common Life he had some Peculiarities He could not bear Musick and if he was ever engaged at Play could not attend to it He neither loved Wine nor Entertainments  nor Dancing nor the Sports of the Field nor relieved his Studies with any other Diversion than that of Walking and Conversation He eat little Flesh and lived almost wholly upon Milk Tea Bread Fruits and Sweetmeats  He had great Vivacity in his Imagination and Ardour in his Desires which the easy Method of his Education had never repressed he therefore conversed among those who had gained his Confidence with great Freedom but his Favourites were not numerous and to others he was always reserved and silent without the least Inclination to discover his Sentiments or display his Learning He never fixed his Choice upon any Employment nor confined his Views to any Profession being desirous of nothing but Knowledge and entirely untainted with Avarice or Ambition He preserved himself always independent and was never known to be guilty of a Lie His constant Application to Learning suppressed those Passions which betray others of his Age to Irregularities and excluded all those Temptations to which Men are exposed by Idleness or common Amusements  FINIS
