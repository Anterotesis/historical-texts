Reader  _THE good Town of  Ipswich  now boasts the Honour of  my Birth  as it formerly did that of the great Cardinal  Wolsey  I was conceived in  Sin  and brought forth in  Iniquity    Anno  so that I am double the Age of my Cousin  Stephen Duck  and have therefore you may rationally suppose  Ploughed    Harrowed  and  Threshed    twice as long and all to no Purpose unless the good Earl of  Macclesfield  will likewise read some of my  Parnassian  Labours to our most Gracious Queen but I live in hopes that his Lordship will grant me this humble Boon and that my Kinsman and I may share one equal Fate  As to my Education the most learned Dr  Arthur Duck  being my Godfather I was by his Interest got upon the Foundation of  Eton  College and having gone through my SchoolStudies I was as well as my Countryman  Thomas Tusser  for sometime a Student in the University of  Cambridge  In this seminary of the Muses our  AlmaMater  being peevish fretful and generally out of Humour I could not so much as Rhime my self into a CollegeFellowship This I took as  Hudibras  says in great  Dudgeon  more especially since it is well known that the whole  Race of the DUCKS were born Poets  I left  King's  College and came to assist my Parents in their FarmingBusiness at  Ipswich  where I soon found that  Corn  and  Hops  came to a much better Market than  Greek  and  Latin  Tho' in this first Part of my RusticMiscellany  I hope th' impartial Reader will discern  I ne'er invok'd the Muses in a Barn  Upon the Death of my intestate Parents being an only Child there fell to me by right of Inheritance a very decent CountryLegacy  viz  Good store of Grain the Pastures well stockt with Cattle Provender for their WinterSustenance and a round sum of Money But as  Horace  says  My Wayward wandring Mind did not approve  My happy State I was inclin'd to rove  And soon experienced the fatal Consequences attending such a Temper In short I had no Notion of foreign Travel nothing would serve me but making the Tour of  ChangeAlley  where in that memorable Year of Chronology I fell a Victim on the Altar which made a daily Sacrifice both of  Cit  and  Bumpkin  Thus having sunk the  Scholar  in the  Farmer  and the  Farmer  having undergone a  SouthSea  Ship wreck I am now reduced to my Kinsman's Pristine Vocation of  God speed the Plough  My Wages are indeed five Shillings and Sixpence  per  Week our County of  Suffolk  giving one Shilling more than they do in  Wiltshire  tho' alas at this Price it is with great Difficulty that  Buckle  and  Throng  as we say are brought together However I am in hopes of seeing better Days  Redeunt  Saturnia  Regna  To conclude in one Word my sole Trust is in my noble Patron therefore  Whate'er thro'  Carolina  's Hand is sent  I'll praise Earl  Macclesfield  and be Content  ARTHUR DUCK  P S  I intend God willing to publish a  second Part  of this  Miscellany  before the Meeting of the Parliament by way of  NewYearsGift  ROGER and URSULA Or LOVE in a HOGSTY  I  GAFFER  and  Gammer  were fast in their Nest  And all the  young Fry  of their Cribs were possess'd  Spott    Whitefoot  and  Puss  in the Ashes were laid  And a blinking RushCandle burnt over their Head  And a blinking Rush  c  II  URS'LA was washing her Dishes and Platter  Preparing to make her good Friend the  Hog  satter  Greas'd up to the Elbows as much to the Eye  'Till her 'broidered Cloaths were e'en ready to fry  'Till her 'broidered  c  III  Close by Her ROGER the Plowman lay snoring  CUPID being vex'd at his clownish adoring  Did straightway convey to the great Loggerhead  The whispering News that they all were in Bed  The whispering  c  IV  Upstarted ROGER and rubbing his Eyes  To his dearest sweet URS'LA in a Passion he flies  Then leaning his Elbows on URS'LA's broad Back  He complain'd that his Heart was e'en ready to crack  He complain'd  c  V  URS'LA being vex'd at the Weight of her Love  Cry'd CUPID why dost Thou thus treacherous prove  In an angry Mood she then turn'd her about  And the Dish Clout lapp'd over the Face of the Lout  And the  c  VI  ROGER being angry at such an Affront  And not at all minding what wou'd come on't  He gave her a Kick with such wonderous Mettle  As tumbled poor URS'LA quite over the Kettle  As tumbl'd  c  VII  At the Noise of this rumbling the  Gaffer  awaken  And fearing lest Thieves had been stealing his  Bacon    With a Pur in his Hand down Stairs he comes stumbling  Where he found  Roger  gaping whilst  Urs'la  lay tumbling  Where he found  c  VIII  Pox take ye quoth he for a  Rogue  and a  Whore    So he turn'd these poor  Lovers  quite out of the Door  Ne'er minding the  Rain  nor the  cold  windy Weather  To  finish  their  Loves  in a  HogSty  together  To finish  c  The MILKMAID a Song  To the Tune of  When bright  Aurelia  c  I  MARIA  when the Paps you press  Each Morn beneath the  Cow    Do not the secret Thoughts of Bliss  Your Mind with fancied Joys possess  And make you long to know  II  See then the gentle curling Stream  That fills your Pail so full  'Tis turn'd to Floods of luscious Cream  Whene'er the  MilkMaid  chance to Dream  She's stroaking of a  Bull  III  Let easier Work your Arms employ  Take better Things in Hand  Since Heaven has made you fit for Joy  Have Pity on the Amorous Boy  Nor let him weeping stand  IV  Then leave off making threemeal  Cheese    For every  Plowman  's Turn  The softer  Curds  of  Beauty  squeeze  And make  Love'sButter  come with ease  By jumbling  Nature's Churn  The PLOWMAN's Wish to his FRIEND  Votatus brevit    c  Mart  SINCE you whom all the World admires  Wou'd know what your poor Friend requires  Some little Spot of Earth he prays  To pass  Incognito  his Days  Who'd venture Conscience Ease and Health  For empty Pleasures useless Wealth  Who'd be the tawdry Fool of War  Or the more noisy Knave at Bar  That might in his own Fields and Wood  Find his Diversion and his Food  His Ponds with various  Fishes  stor'd  The  Bees  for him their Honey hoard  A  Nutbrown  LASS both kind and neat  To make his Bed and dress his Meat  He that hates me or likes not this  May he ne'er know so sweet a Bliss  But fool'd with Riches or Renown  Still stay behind and rot in Town  Now or Never Or the MAID's Counsellor  I  CONSULT dear Nymph your faithful Glass  The Chrystal Streams the bord'ring Grass  Then think how Youth and Beauty pass  II  MARIA once so fair and young  No more's the burthen of our Song  Since cruel TIME has done her Wrong  III  His  Scythe  has Mown her  Rosy Cheek    Cut down the  Lillies  of her Neck  And crop'd the  Flowers  which Maids bedeck  IV  Her Eyes that pierc'd the yielding Soul  The  Toast  to ev'ry  Shepherd  's Bowl  Shall now no more our Hearts controul  V  Her  Voice  so sweet she use to rear  As brought the list'ning  Birds  to hear  No longer Charms th' attentive Ear  VI  Her  Lips  like  Comb  for  Honey  prest  Like  Balls  of  Snow  her melting  Breast    By envious Age she's all undrest  VII  Every  Rose  with drooping Leaves  An Emblem of the  Virgin  gives  Whose foolish Pride herself deceives  VIII  Then  Damsels  mark the  fading  Flow'r  Presume no longer in your Pow'r  Blossom  's vanish every Hour  IX  Let then the  Youth  no longer mourn  Nor by destructive  Passion  burn  For Charms once  gone  can ne'er  return  Epitaph on my Uncle's APE  UNDER this Slate do lye the last Remains  Of one whom selfconceited Man disdains  And scoffing calls an APE but MAN was he  If  Tumblers  or if  DancingMasters  be  He did Alive in  either Art  excel  And now's  Gallanted  by  OldMaids  in  Hell  DAMON Or The Shepherd's PARADISE  I  WHERE Pines and Cedars form a Wood  On either side a Chrystal Flood  Where CUPID makes his chief Abode  And softest Scenes of Love  Where Innocence adorns the Swain  Where FLORA crowns the verdant Plain  And PHILOMELA tunes a main  The Bounties of great JOVE  II  Where Plenty crowns each smiling Brow  Without the toilsome Help of Plow  The  Flocks  do bleat and  Oxen  low  While Birds melodious Sing  And warble forth Dame Nature's Praise  Where  Phoebus  sheds his brightest Rays  Bestowing on those happy Days  An everlasting Spring  III  Here wou'd I chuse some  rural Fair    The only Object of my Care  Nor be forsworn nor yet despair  By modern Arts betray'd  Her Choice shou'd fix her Love on me  Her Words and Actions all be free  If GRATIANA such wou'd be  My Happiness were made  IV  Her Eyes wou'd give a chearful Day  Her Smiles make ev'ry Shade look gay  While at her Sight the Flocks wou'd play  And Linnets stretch their Voice  And sure where'er my VENUS moves  The  Shrubs  shou'd rise to  Myrtle Groves    And I'd supply a  Train of Loves    And  get a Race of Boys  CAROLETTA Or The Shepperdess  MENALCAS sure deserves the Bays  Who aims at CAROLETTA's Praise  An airy gay and frisking She  Not Fond but without Coyness free  Her pretty Freedoms please the Wise  And none are Jealous who have Eyes  None can suspect the  Lovely Fair    Or think Hypocrisy dwells there  Trace Her thro' ev'ry Part and Grace  Thro' ev'ry Lineament of Face  A living Miracle you'll find  Of Body blended with the Mind  A Humour Debonâir and Fit  To match her Beauty and her Wit  By Beauty form'd to charm Mankind  To conquer all our Sex design'd  For Wit and Repartee renown'd  With Words that Cure as well as Wound  As when they cut a BrilliantStone  Such as with PIT of late was known  At ev'ry Chip a Jewel flies  And Sparkles after Sparkles rise  So when you once this Nymph provoke  To Raillery or chearful Joke  New Beauties in each Notion shine  New Turns of Thought with Thought combine  Wit uncontroul'd which nought can stem  And ev'ry Sentence is a Gem  PHILLIS a Song  I  LET Fops of vain Happiness proud  Delight in Appearance and Noise  Their Pleasures divide with the Croud  The Wise are more nice in their Joys  II  My PHILLIS is charming alone  And all that behold her adore  Then if I wou'd keep her my own  No Rival must know of my Store  III  Adieu to the rest of Mankind  To Desarts I fain wou'd retire  In PHILLIS alone I shall find  Whatever I want or desire  IV  For soon as her Beauties appear  New Brightness enlightens the Plain  And only attended by her  I'll envy no Monarch his Train  POLYPHEMUS to his MISTRESS from  Ovid  O GALATEA Thou'rt the Flow'r of  May    Tall as a Poplar as a Meadow gay  Splendid as Glass gamesome as any Kid  Airy as Cockles toss'd by ev'ry Tide  Grateful as Summer's Shade or Winter's Shine  Sweet as an Apple sightly as a Pine  Smoother than mellow Grapes whiter than Snow  Soft as a Swan or Stroakings from the Cow  And if you did not shun my fond Embrace  Fair as a Garden where a Fountain plays  Again thou'rt wild as any Colt unbroke  False as the Waves obdurate as an Oak  Weaker than sallow Twigs or than the Vine  Harder than Rocks more Headstrong than the Rhine  Proud as a Peacock when we him admire  Sharper than Thorns and hotter than the Fire  Deaf as the Seas cruel as Bears at Rut  Fierce as an Adder trodden under Foot  And what the greatest Plague of all I find  You fly the Lover like the hunted Hind  Fleeting as Air and volatile as Wind  Verses writ upon a GLASS  'TIS generous Wine refines our Clay  And makes our Souls outshine the Day  'Tis BACCHUS guards our  Health  and  Truth    Inspires our  Wit  preserves our  Youth    Enobles  Friendship  downs  Deceit    And smooths the  rugged Brow  of  Fate  The only Cure of  gloomy Spleen    The  Show'r  that makes our  Sky  serene  Then since the GOD has crown'd our Cup  'Twere  Folly  not to  drink it up  The SPARROW from CATULLUS  Humbly Inscribed to my much respected and honoured KinsWoman Mrs GRACE HOWARD  MOURN all ye CUPIDS Mourn ye  little  Loves  Mourn ye fair Maids and mourn ye pretty Doves  My  Lesbia  's SPARROW Fate has rapt away  Her darling Joy and Pleasure of her Day  Sweeter  he  was than ever Tongue can tell  Well worthy Love and was belov'd as well  The pretty  Sparrow  his own  Mistress  knew  As well as infant  Babes  their  Mothers  do  From  her  dear Lap his Wings he never mov'd  But hover'd round and show'd how well he lov'd  Round her fair Bosom still  he  hopp'd and play'd  And chirp'd with Joy about the lovely  Maid  But now poor Bird treads PLUTO's gloomy shore  Never ah never to return once more  And you dark Shades of Hell's infernal Reign  Ten thousand Curses for your Plague remain  Instant you seize on all that's Sweet and Gay  Ev'n LESBIA's  Bird  welllov'd you stole away  O Fact accurst poor TOM at last is dead  Hangs his weak Neck and droops his sickly Head  Griev'd at the Loss my LESBIA too appears  Swells her fair  Eye  and reddens into  Tears  To the Lady BRIDGET OSBORNE with a Present of Grapes  TH' Illustrious Planet that directs the Day  To ev'ry Blade of Grass extends a Ray  A Blaze of Incense has been known to move  The Powers below us and the Pow'rs above  Then Thou my FAIR accept without disdain  An humble Off'ring from an humble Swain  BRITANNIA is a Clime that well may boast  Its flow'ry Valleys and its fruitful Coast  Mild are the Seasons fragrant is the Air  Large are her Harvests and her Product fair  But far above the rest her  Vines  produce  The loveliest Figure and the kindest Juice  Fruits fine as these could never be design'd  For Creatures of a base and vulgar Kind  No they're design'd to entertain the Fair  And such as Heav'n makes its peculiar Care  For them th' ambitious Grove attempts the Sky  The Fountains murmur and the Breezes sigh  For them the  Lilly  paints the  Violet  blows  And modest Blushes tinge the fragrant  Rose    For them the  Citron  loads its Boughs anew  And the glad  Orange  takes a golden Hue  For them gay Flow'rs enamel all the Mead  And other  Olives  to the last succeed  For them our SUN the cluster'd  Grape  refines  For them our  Elms  are wedded with our  Vines    And condescend to take the spousal Twines  Thou fairest of thy Sex and best to THEE  Are due the choicest Riches of the Tree  Accept the ready Offerings of the Plain  Confess th' Extent of this auspicious Reign  And never let us pay our V  ws in vain  So when of old the  Farmer  's Toil was o'er  And all his Barns were crouded with his Store  To that indulgent Power that gave him Peace  And to his Corn and to his Herds increase  He paid the noblest Profits of the Year  With rigid Justice and Religious Fear  EPIGRAMS  YOU've often averr'd I'm the persectest Wit  That ever you saw or convers'd withal yet  And I in return have has often profest  That of all Womankind you're the fairest and best  The Assertions of Both are equally true  For as you Laugh at me so do I Laugh at you  ANOTHER  PHILANDER loads his Board with noble Fare  And ev'ry one that comes is welcome there  Be wise PHILANDER and thou than shalt see  They love thy  Burgundy  but Laugh at thee  ANOTHER  BELINDA is reduc'd 'tis said  To prostitute her self for Bread  And if they're sure to hit the White  That mingle Profit with Delight  BELINDA's greatly in the Right  ANOTHER  Be not vain of your fancy'd Success I desire you  Nor think that I love you because I admire you  A Monster does doubtless deserve Admiration  As much as the prettiest Girl in the Nation  And hourly Experience CORINNA will show ye  A GRANNY is stare'd at as much as a CHLOE  ANOTHER  Sir GEORGE the most uncertain of Mankind  Turns with the Tide and wavers with the Wind  For well he knows all Times will favour him  Who makes no Conscience with the Times to Trim  From MARTIAL  As  Oaks  in stormy Seasons shed  The treacherous Leaves they bear  So CALVUS did but  shake  his  Head    And off he  shook  his  Hair  ANOTHER  On Mr PRIOR's Tomb in  WestminsterAbby  This Busto  Lewis  gave our Bard his Strains  At least the best are borrow'd from  Fontaine's  Then what wou'd  Prior  be shou'd  Gallia  claim  Her  gifted  Monument and  borrow'd  Fame  An Imitation of OVID in  Distress  Ille ego qui fneram tenerorum lusoramorum  I'M he who once indulg'd an amorous Vein  And thought all Poets of a heavenly Strain  My easy Heart each puny Girl subdu'd  Coquets I flatter'd and ador'd the Prude  Thanks to my Muse for she those Joys refin'd  Dissolv'd my Cares and made  Corinna  kind  Without restraint I pass'd my Youths best Hours  In easy Studies or in soft Amours  You Father  Bacchus  now extend your Aid  Remember I was once a roaring Blade  The Gods themselves have Festivals of Mirth  'Tis then they show'r their Blessings down on Earth  And you dear Friends and Brothers of the Quill  Remember me and each his Bumper fill  When you the Name of honest  Naso  hear  Set down the Glass and drop a friendly Tear  Look round about and with a tender Voice  Cry where's the faithful Part'ner of our Joys  Whilst I alone beguile the tedious Day  With Books and strive to read my Cares away  I banish Fate's Unkindness from my Mind  And fancy o'er the Joys I left behind  My Muse to me is all the World beside  My kind Physician and my loving Bride  EPITAPH on a SEXTON  I  HERE lies old HARE  Worn out with Care  Who whilom  toll'd  the  Bell    Could  dig  a  Grave    Or  set  a  Stave    And say  Amen  full well  II  For  sacred Song    He'ad HOPKIN's Tongue  And STERNHOLD's  eke  also  With  Cough  and  Hem    He  stood  by  them    As far's his  Word  would  go  III  Full many a  Feast    For  Worms  he  dress'd    Himself  yet wanted  Bread  But he is  gone    With  Skin  and  Bone    To  Starve  'em now he's  Dead  IV  Here take his  Spade    And use his  Trade    Now he is  out  of  Breath    Cover the  Bones    Of  him  who  once    Wrought  Journey Work  for DEATH  An Imitation of  Horace  's ODE on FORTUNE  I  SOME  hoist up  Fortune  to the  Skies    Others  debase  her  to a  Bubble    I  nor her  Frowns  nor  Favours  prize  Nor think the  Chang'ling  worth my Trouble  II  If at my Door  she  chance to light  I civilly my  Guest  receive  The  Visit  paid I bid  GoodNight    Nor murmur when  she  takes her  Leave  III  Tho' prosp'rous  Gales  my  Canvas  croud  Tho' smooth the  Waves  serene the  Sky    I  trust not  Calms  they  Storms  forebode  And speak th'  approaching Tempest  nigh  IV  Then  Virtue  to the  Helm  repair  Thou  Innocence  shalt guide the Oar  Now rage ye  Winds    Storms  rend the  Air    My  Barque  thus  Mann'd  shall  gain  the  Shore  EPITAPH on the late Duke of  B * * *  HERE GRUBINOT lies on very ill Terms  First a Prey to the  Flies  and then to the  Worms  Those who grieve at his Loss needn't  wonder  he's gone  For the  Carcase  must  rot  when the  Flesh  is  Fly  blown  But this must be said in his Praise  Tho' Death cruel Death from us forc'd him  He dy'd by endeav'ring to raise  His old Friend that lay Dead before him  The END of PART I
