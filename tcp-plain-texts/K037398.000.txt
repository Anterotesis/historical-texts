 Five PASTORAL ECLOGUES The SCENES of which are Suppos'd to lie among the SHEPHERDS oppress'd by the WAR in  Germany  Impius hoec tam culta novalia Miles habebit  Barbaras has segetes En quo discordia cives  Perduxit miseros en queis consevimus agros  VIRGIL  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's Head in  Pallmall  MDCCXLV Price One Shilling  PREFACE  IT is generally thought that as Pastorals are a kind of poetry which has been touch'd upon by such a number of poets that they are easily compos'd and that their thoughts and sentiments must be trite and vulgar However this opinion may be true in reason I hope the following pieces will be exempt from it's censure as they are form'd on a plan entirely new and as their design is essentially distinguish'd from any productions of their kind either ancient or modern unless it be that the first and ninth Bucolic of Virgil are in the same nature How the ideas of fields and woods and a poetry whose very essence is a rural life will agree with the polite taste of the town and of gentlemen who are more conversant in the fashionable ornaments of life is a question but I hope as they relate to that war which is at present the most general topic of conversation this unpoliteness will in some measure be excused  The learned reader will observe that the author has endeavour'd to imitate the simplicity of the ancients in these pieces as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to Pastoral but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in general As to the design of this work I hope it will not be thought odd or illchosen The opposing interests of a peaceful and rural life and the tumultuous scenes of war together with the various struggles and passions arising from thence seem by no means an improper field for the most elegant writer to exercise his genius in How far the author of these pieces has succeeded in the performance of this is humbly submitted to the censure and judgment of the public  ECLOGUE THE FIRST  LYCAS and ALPHON  ALPH  ARISE my Lycas in yon' woody wilds  From a rough rock in deep enclosure hid  Of thickest oaks a gushing fountain falls  And pours it's airy stream with torrent pure  Which late returning from the field at eve  I found invited by it's dashing sound  As thro' the gloom it struck my passing ear  Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks  Fit place to cool their thirst in midday hour  Due west it rifes from that blasted beech  The way but shortcome Lycas rouze thy dog  Let us be gone  LYC  Alas my friend of flock  Of spring or shepherd's lore to me is vain  To tell my fav'rite lamb the solace dear  Of these grey locks my sweet and sole delight  Is snatch'd by cruel fate an armed band  On neighing steeds elate in wide array  Trampled the youngling as the vale along  At eve they pass'd beneath their whelming march  ALPH  Such throng I heard as in the neighb'ring wood  I wander'd to reduce a straggling ewe  Escap'd the fold what time the griesly owl  Her shrieks began and at the wonted elm  The cows awaiting stood Lucilla's hand  When strait with sudden fear alarm'd I start  And list'ning to the distantechoing steps  Of unseen horsemen with attentive ear  I stand aloof But why this deepfelt grief  Merits such loss these tears and black despair  LYC  Alphon no more to Lycas now remains  Since he my last and latest care is lost  Thou know'st my little flock three tender ewes  Were all my mean ambition wish'd or sought  Ev'n now nine days and nine revolving nights  Are past since these the Moldaw's raging flood  Swept with their wattled cotes as o'er it's banks  It rose redundant swoln with beating rains  And deep immers'd beneath it's whirling wave  I wak'd at early dawn and to the field  I issus'd to pursue my wonted toil  When lo nor flocks nor wattled cotes I saw  But all that met my wond'ring eyes around  Was desolation sad Here stateliest oaks  Torn from their roots with broken branches lay  In hideous ruin there the fields that laugh'd  With rip'ning corn of all their charms despoil'd  With oozy fragments scatter'd waste and wild  Were seen I curst the wicked spirit drear  That in the ruin'd abbey's darkest cell  That stands immur'd amid yon' lonesome pines  I bound with triple chains his magic pow'r  Oft'times with howling storms and thunder loud  Deforms the night and blackens nature's face  His tempests swell'd the Moldaw's rising streams  And thus o'erwhelm'd my flockBut this my heart  Had learn'd to bear at length to comfort's voice  It had obey'd and all it's woes forgot  When ah too soon returning woes invade  My breast just rising from its former stroke  When this the sole survivor of my flock  Follows his lost companions while a wretch  I here remain deserted and forlorn  He too had dy'd beneath the whelming surge  Had not the shelter of my lowrooft cott  That fatal night preserv'd him where at eve  I hap'ly plac'd him with providing care  Lest the fell storm which yet from southern clouds  Threaten'd destruction and to low'r began  Might violate his tenderblooming age  ALPH  With piteous eye and sympathizing heart  Thy tears I viewThese scenes of war and blood  The calm repose of every field invade  Myself had fall'n a victim to their rage  As in deep dead of night my cave beneath  I lay dissolv'd in sleep with warning voice  Had not my dog alarm'd with wond'ring ear  When strait approach'd the cave a savage throng  With barb'rous arms and habit fierce and wild  With stern demeanour and defying look  Terrify which the moon's paleglimm'ring rays  Presented to my sight as in the boughs  Close shrouded of a neighb'ring pine I sat  Where sudden fear had driv'n me to evade Impending fate unconscious and amaz'd  Secure but trembling and in chilly damps  My limbs bedew'dThe monsters as they past  With dire confusion all the cavern fill'd  Hurl'd to the ground my scrip and beechen cup  Dispers'd the shaggy skins that form my bed  And o'er the trampled floor had scatter'd wide  A hoard of choicest chesnuts which I cull'd  With nicediscerning care and had design'd  A present to my beauteous ROSALINDE  Alas with them her love had been obtain'd  And me to MYRON she had then preferr'd  LYC  Shepherd on thee has fortune kindly smil'd  'Tis mine to feel her griefinflicting hand  Alas each object that I view around  Recalls my perish'd darling to my sight  And mocks me with his loss see there the spring  Where oft he wont to flake his eager thirst  And there the beech beneath whose breezy shade  He lov'd to lie close covert from the sun  See yet the bark smoothworn and bare remains  Where oft the youngling rubb'd his tender side  Ah what avail'd my care and foresight vain  That day he fell oppress'd by whelming steeds  This hand had built a bow'r of thickest boughs  Compos'd and wove with intermingling leaves  Impervious to the sun and strew'd the floor  With choicest hay that in the secret shade  He might repose nor feel the dogstar's beam  But why this sad repeated track of woe  I still pursue Farewel my ALPHON dear  To distant fields and pastures will I go  Where impious war and discord nurse of blood  Shall ne'er profane the silence of the groves  ECLOGUE the SECOND  ACIS and ALCYON  ACIS  WHILE in the bosom of this deep recess  The voice of war has lost its madding shouts  Let us improve the transient hour of peace  And calm our troubled minds with mutual songs  While this recess conspiring with the muse  Invites to peaceful thoughts this cavern deep  And these tall pines that nodding from the rock  Wave o'er its mouth their umbrage black and cast  A venerable gloom with this clear fount  That cleaves the riven stone and fills the cave  With hollowtinkling sounds Repeat the song  Which late ALCYON from thy mouth I heard  As to the spring we drove our thirsting flocks  It tells the charms of grateful evening mild  Begin ALCYON ACIS in return  Shall sing the praises of the dawning morn  ALCY  Behind the hills when sinks the western sun  And falling dews breath fragrance thro' the air  Refreshing every field with coolness mild  Then let me walk the twilight meadows green  Or breezy uplands near thickbranching elms  While the still landschape sooths my soul to rest  And every care subsides to calmest peace  The mists slowrising from the rivers dank  The woods scarce stirring at the whisp'ring wind  The streaky clouds that tinge their darken'd tops  With russet hues and fainter gleams of light  The solitude that all around becalms  The peaceful air conspire to wrap my soul  In musings mild and nought the solemn scene  And the still silence breaks but distant sounds  Of bleating flocks that to their destin'd fold  The shepherd drives meantime the shrilltun'd bell  Of some lone ewe that wander's from the rest  Tinkles faroff with solitary sound  The lowing cows that wait the milker's hand  The cottagemastiff's bark the joyous shouts  Of swains that meet to wrestle on the green  Are heard around But ah since ruthless war  Has ravag'd in these fields so tranquil once  Too oft' alas the din of clashing arms  And discord fell disturbs the softer scene  Thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox  While in loose traces from the furrow'd field  He comes thy dawn the weary reaper loves  Who long had fainted in the midday sun  Pleas'd with the cooler hour along the vale  Whistling he home returns to kiss his babes  With joyful heart his labour's sweet reward  But ah what sudden fears amaze his soul  When near approaching all before he sees  His lowly cottage and the village 'round  Swept into ruin by the hand of war  Dispers'd his children and his muchlov'd wife  No more to glad his breast with home feltjoys  I too when in my watled cotes are laid  My supping flock rejoice to meet my dear  My fair LAURETTA at the wonted oak  Or haply as her milkingpail she bears  Returning from the field to ease her arm  Sweet office and impart my aiding hand  Thy charms O beauteous Evening shall be sung  As long as these tall pines shall wave their heads  Or this clear fountain cleave the riven stone  ACIS  Sweet are the dews of Eve her fragrance sweet  Sweet are the pinetopt hills at sultry noon  Sweet is the shelter of the friendly grott  To sheep and shepherd at impending storms  But ah less sweet the fragrant dews of eve  Less sweet the pinetopt hills at sultry noon  Less sweet the shelter of the friendly grott  Than when the rising sun with rosy beam  Peeps o'er the villagetop and o'er the fields  The woods the hills the streams and level meads  Scatters bright splendors and diffusive joy  As to his flock the shepherd issues forth  Printing new footsteps in the dewy vale  Each object of the joyous scene around  Vernal delight inspires and glads his heart  Unknowing of the cause with newfelt glee  The chaunt of early birds on every bush  The steaming odours of the freshblown flow'rs  ALC  Cease ACIS cease thy songfrom yonder hill  Whose lofty sides inclose this secret seat  Our flocks that graze along its verd'rous brow  Tumultuous rush as struck with sudden fright  And hark methinks I hear the deathful sounds  Of war approaching and its thunders roar  ACIS  Kind heav'n preserve my wife and children dear  Alas I fear the sound that louder now  Swells in the wind and comes with fuller din  Is near my cottage which thou know'st my friend  Stands at the spring that issues from beneath  That rising hill fast by the branching elm  ALC  See see my friend what darksome spires arise  Of wreathing smoak and blacken all the sky  Nearer and nearer comes the threat'ning voice  And more distinguish'd strikes our trembling ear  But lo the foes advance above the hill  I see their glitt'ring arms begin to gleam  Come let us flie and in the deepest nook  The inmost cavern of this winding grott  Closeshroud ourselves lest in the gen'ral stream  Of thousands thronging down we fall opprest  ECLOGUE the THIRD  WHEN sable midnight on the fields and woods  Had spread her mantle dark then wander'd forth  The pensive ALCON and the bosom deep  Of a wild wood with solitary steps  There to lament his wretched fate he sought  Him late as o'er the vale at coming eve  Joyful he walk'd with his LUCILLA dear  A soldier sternadvancing on his steed  Robb'd of his love and tore the beauteous maid  With brutal hand from his contending arms  Weeping in vain and shrieking for his aid  And frowning bore the precious prize away  The wood whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought  Was dark and pathless and by neighb'ring feet  Long time untrod for there in ancient days  Two knights of bold emprise and high renown  Met in fierce combat to dispute the prize  Of beauty bright whose valiant arm shou'd win  A virgin fair whose faremblazon'd charms  With equal love had smote their rival breasts  The knight who fell beneath the victor's sword  Unhears'd and restless from that fatal day  Wanders the hated shades a spectre pale  And each revolving night are heard to sound  Far from the inmost bow'r of the deep wood  Loud shrieks and hollow groans and rattling chains  When the dark secrets of the grove he gain'd  Beneath an ancient oak his weary limbs  He laid adown and thus to plain began  This midnight deep to plaintive love accords  This lonesone silence and these hideous shades  That in this darksome hour I dare to tread  And all the horrors of this fearful place  Will suit a wretch abandon'd to despair l  But hahwhat means this sudden fear that creeps  In chilly sweats o'er all my trembling limbs  What hollowwhisp'ring sounds are those I hear  From yonder gladedo not I hear his voice  Does not the knight that in these shades was slain  Call me to come and beckon with his hand  Do not I see his visionary sword  Wav'd in bright circles thro' the murky air  Does not he point his woundsbe still my fears  'Tis vain illusion all and phantasie  These fears my lovedistemper'd brain suggests  Alas they will not bring me back my love  Who now perhaps amid the thronged camp  On earth's cold breast reclines her weary head  A helpless virgin subject to the will  Of each rude ravisher and distant far  From her dear ALCON and her native fields  Ill will the hardships of inclement skies  Suit with her tender limbs the various toils  Of painful marches her unwonted ears  How bear the trumpet and the sounds of war  This task is hard indeedbut soon alas  At will her savage lord may cast her off  And leave her to succeeding scenes of woe  I see my dear LUCILLA once my own  Naked and hungry tread the pensive steps  Of desolation doom'd to wander o'er  Helpless and vagabond the friendless earth  I hear her sigh for ALCON and her home  And ask for bread at some proud palace gate  With unavailing voice This toilsome scene  Alas how diff'rent from the smoother paths  Of rural life my dear was wont to tread  Forth to the field to bear the milkingpail  Was all her wont to tread the tedded grass  To tend her father's flock beneath the oak  To snatch her dinner sweet and on the green  With the companions of her age to sport  In vain I now expect the coming on  Of dewbath'd eve to meet my wonted love  No more I hear the woodgirt vallies ring  With her blythe voice that oft has blest mine ear  As in the distant shade I sate unseen  No more I meet her at the wonted spring  Where each revolving noon she daily went  To fill her pitcher with the crystal flood  If in her native fields the hand of death  Had snatch'd her from my arms I cou'd have born  The fatal shock with lessrepining heart  For then I could have had one parting kiss  I cou'd have  her hearse with fairest flow'rs  And paid the last sad office to my dear  Return my sweet LUCILLA to my arms  At thy return all nature will rejoice  Together will we walk the verdant vales  And mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet  Come I will climb for thee the knotted oak  To rob the stockdove of his feathery young  I'll shew thee where the softest cowslips spring  And clust'ring nuts their laden branches bend  Together will we taste the dews of morn  Together seek the grotts at sultry noon  Together from the field at eve return  What have I said what painted scenes of bliss  My vain imagination has display'd  Alas she's gone ah never to return  Farewell my past'ral pipe and my dear flock  Farewell my faithful dog my oncelov'd haunts  Farewell or cave or fountain or fresh shade  Farewell and thou my lowrooft cott farewell  Here will I lie and fellest wolves that roam  This savage forest shall devour my limbs  Unwept unburied in a place unknown  ECLOGUE the FOURTH  MYCON and PHILANTHES  MYC  WELCOME Philanthes to thy native fields  Thrice three revolving moons are gone and past  Since first you parted from your father's cott  To drive to pastures far remote your flock  Since that alas how oft has savage war  Disturb'd our dwellings and defac'd our fields  PHIL  MYCON each object that I view around  Speaks ruin and destruction See my friend  The ancient wood whose venerable shades  So oft have shelter'd us from noonday suns  So oft have echo'd to the lowing herds  That fed widewandering in the neighb'ring vales  The soldier's ax has levell'd with the ground  And to the sun expos'd its darksome bow'rs  The distant villages and bluetopt hills  The farstretch'd meads appear and meet mine eyes  That erst were intercepted by the grove  MYC  How is the wonted face of all things chang'd  Those trees by whose aspiring tops we knew  The sun's ascent at noon unerring mark  No more are seen to tell the coming hour  How naked does the winding rill appear  Whose banks its pendant umbrage deepimbrown'd  And farinvested with its arborous roof  As by its side it roll'd its secret streams  How oft alas those shadowy banks along  Close solitude my ROSALIND and I  Have walk'd in converse sweet and link'd in love  But tell me dear PHILANTHES are the fields  Which late you left like ours by war opprest  Alike in tumult and confusion wrapt  PHI  MYCON I'll tell thee wonders past belief  It hap'd one morn when first the dawning sun  Began to chear the lightenliven'd earth  Caught with so bright a scene I sought the fields  Before my wonted hour and roving wide  Among the vales the villages and woods  Where'er my fancy led or pleasure call'd  I chanc'd upon a neighb'ring hill to stray  To view the glitt'ring prospect from its top  Of the broad Rhine that roll'd his waves beneath  Amid the level of extended meads  When  It may be suppos'd that in these lines the shepherd is giving an account of Prince CHARLES's passing the Rhine  lo e'er yet I gain'd its lofty brow  The sound of dashing floods and dashing arms  And neighing steeds confusive struck mine ear  Studious to know what tumult was at hand  With step adven'trous I advanc'd and gain'd  With tim'rous care and cautious ken its top  Sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight  From arms and all th' imblazonrie of war  Reflected far while steeds and men and arms  Seem'd floating wide and stretch'd in vast array  O'er the broad bosom of the bigswoln flood  That dashing roll'd its beamy waves between  The banks promiscuous swarm'd with thronging troops  These on the flood embarking those appear'd  Crowding the adverse shore already past  All was confusion all tumultuous din  I trembled as I look'd tho' far above  And in one blaze their arms were blended bright  With the broad stream while all the glist'ring scene  The morn illum'd and in one splendor clad  Struck at the sight I left with headlong haste  The steepbrow'd hill and o'er th' extended vales  The woodgirt lawns I ran nor slack'd my pace  Till at my flock thickpanting I arriv'd  And drove far off beneath a deeparch'd cave  But come my friend inform me in return  Since this my absence what has here fell out  MYC  Dost thou remember at the river's side  That solitary convent all behind  Hid by the convert of a mantling wood  One night when all was wrapt in darkness deep  An armed troop on rage and rapine bent  Pour'd o'er the fields and ravag'd all they met  Nor did that sacred pile escape their arms  Whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept  And fill'd its caverns deep with armed throngs  Greedy of spoil and snatch'd their treasures old  From their dark seats the shrieking sisters fled  Dispers'd and naked thro' the fields and woods  While sable night conceal'd their wand'ring steps  Part in my mossgrown cottage shelter sought  Which haply scap'd their rage in secret glade  Immersed deepI rose at early morn  With fearful heart to view the ruin'd dome  Where all was desolation all appear'd  The seat of horror and devouring war  The deep recesses and the gloomy nooks  The vaulted isles and shrines of imag'd saints  The caverns worn by holy knees appear'd  And to the sun were op'dIn musing thought  I said as on the pile I bent my brow  " This seat to future ages will appear  " Like that which stands fast by the piny rock  " These silent walls with ivy shall be hung  " And distant times shall view the sacred pile  " Unknowing how it fell with pious awe  " The pilgrim here shall visit and the swain  " Returning from the field at twilight grey  " Shall shun to pass this way subdued by fear  " And slant his course across the adverse vale"  PHI  MYCON thou see'st that cow which stands in cool  Amid yon rushy lake beneath the shade  Of willow green and ruminates at ease  The watry herbage that around her floats  That way my business leads I go to greet  My father and my wonted cottage dear  MYC  Come let us go my path is that way too  Come my PHILANTHES and may piteous heav'n  Indulge more happy days and calm our griefs  Alas I thought some trouble was at hand  And long before presag'd the coming storm  Ev'n when the light'ning one disastrous night  Blasted the hoary oak whose ample boughs  Imbow'r my cottage and as on the grass  At noon I slept a serpent's sudden hiss  Broke my sweet restBut come let us be gone  The sun begins to welk in ruddy west  ECLOGUE the FIFTH  CORIN and CALISTAN  COR  WHICH way CALISTAN whither dost thou lead  That lamb whom yet his mother scarce has wean'd  CAL  His mother CORIN as she wand'ring fed  With this tender youngling by her side  Fell by a shot which from the battle came  That in the neighb'ring fields so lately rag'd  COR  Alas what woes that fatal day involv'd  Our suff'ring village and the fields around  But come CALISTAN on this rising bank  Come let us sit and on the danger past  Converse secure and number all our griefs  See how the flaunting woodbine shades the bank  And weaves a mantling canopy above  CAL  CORIN that day I chanc'd at earlier hour  To rise and drove faroff my flock unpent  To wash them in a spring that late I mark'd  There the first motions of the deathful day  I heard as listening to the trickling wave  I stood attentive when like rising storms  Hoarse hollow murmurs from afar I heard  And undistinguish'd sounds of distant din  Alarm'd I stood unknowing whence it came  And from the fount my flock unwash'd I drove  Suspecting danger when as nearer yet  I came advancing all was tumult loud  All was tempestuous din on ev'ry side  And all around the roar of war was up  From rock to rock retost from wood to wood  Not half so loud the tumbling cataract  Is heard to roar that from the pineclad cliff  Praecipitates its waves whose distant sounds  I oft have listen'd as at twilight grey  I pent my flocks within their watled cotes  COR  For three revolving days nor voice of bird  Melodious chaunting or the bleat of sheep  Or lowing oxen near the fatal place  Were heard to sound but all was silence sad  The ancient grove of elms deserted stood  Where long had dwelt an aged race of rooks  That with their nests had crowded every branch  We oft' have heard them at the dusk of eve  In troops returning to their wellknown home  In mingled clamors sounding from on high  CAL  CORIN thou know'st the firinvested cave  Where late we shelter'd from a gath'ring storm  Our flocks together driv'n beneath its shade  I had appointed at sweet eventide  To meet my DELIA homeward as she pass'd  Bearing her milkingpail Alas the thoughts  Of that sweet congress the preceding night  Soften'd my dreams and all my senses lull'd  And with more joyful heart at morn I rose  But ah that tumult cropt my blooming hopes  And in confusion wrapt my love and me  COR  That day nor in the fold my flock I pent  Or walk'd at eve the vales or on the turf  Beneath the wonted oak my dinner took  Or slept at noon amid my languid sheep  Repos'd at ease on the green meadow's bed  When sable night came on for not ev'n yet  The tumult had subsided into peace  Ev'n then low sounds and interrupted bursts  Of war we heard and cries of dying men  And a confus'd hum of the ceasing storm  All night closeshrouded in a forest thick  Wakeful I sate my flock around me laid  And of neglected boughs I kindled up  A scanty flame whose darklygleaming blaze  Among th' enlighten'd trees form'd hideous shapes  And spectres pale to my distemper'd mind  How oft I look'd behind with cautious fear  And trembled at each motion of the wind  But where did you CALISTAN shelter seek  What dark retreat conceal'd your wand'ring steps  CAL  CORIN thou know'st the furclad hermit's cell  Deeparch'd beneath a rock among the wilds  Thither I bent my flight a welcome guest  And not unknown for when my flock I fed  Of late beneath the neighb'ring pastures green  I oft was wont invited at his call  At noon beneath his cavern to retire  From the sun's heat where all the passing hours  The good oldman improv'd with converse high  And in my breast enkindled virtue's love  Nor seldom would his hospitable hand  Afford a short repast of berries cool  Which o'er the wilds his scanty food he pluck'd  Here was my refugeAll the livelong night  Pensive by one pale lonesome lamp we sate  And listen'd to the bleak winds whistling loud  And the shrill crash of forests from without  Soon as the morning dawn'd the craggy height  Of the steep rock I climb'd on whose wild top  His rustic temple stood and mossgrown cross  The sacred object of his pious pray'rs  Form'd of a tall fir's thunderblasted trunk  Where all beneath th' expansive plains I saw  With white pavilions hid in deep array  There too my little fold which late I left  Standing at eve amid the warlike scene  With tearful eyes affrighted I beheld  Alas how chang'd the scene when there I pitch'd  Those hurdled co  es the night was calm and mild  And all was peaceful I remember well  While there within that fold my flock I pent  How blythe I heard my beauteous DELIA sing  Her distantechoing voice how sweetly rung  And all my ravish'd senses wrapt in bliss  COR  Hast thou not seen the fatal plain of death  Where rag'd the conflict there they say at eve  Grim ghosts are seen of men that there were slain  Pointing their wounds and shrieking to their mates  Still doom'd to haunt the fields on which they fell  CAL  CORIN no more This lamb demands my speed  See how the youngling hangs his sickly head  Tender and fainting for his wonted food  I haste to place him in my shelt'ring cott  Fed from my hand and cherish'd by my care  And see my friend far off in darken'd west  A cloud comes on and threatens sudden rains  CORIN farewell the storm begins to low'r  FINIS
