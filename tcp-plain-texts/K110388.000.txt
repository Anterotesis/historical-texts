 A NARRATIVE OF FACTS RELATING TO A Prosecution for High Treason INCLUDING THE ADDRESS TO THE JURY Which the Court refused to hear WITH LETTERS TO THE Attorney General Lord Chief Justice Eyre Mr Serjeant Adair the Honourable Thomas Erskine and Vicary Gibbs Esq AND THE DEFENCE The Author had prepared if he had been brought to Trial  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  LONDON  PRINTED FOR H D SYMONDS PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCXCV  ADVERTISEMENT  WHILE imprisoned in Newgate though thoroughly persuaded I should never be tried I yet thought it a very serious duty to prepare for my Defence It was accordingly written during my detention and being first ready was first sent to the press In point of order however it was necessary to be placed the last this is the reason that the paging recommences with the Defence It is likewise necessary to add that it must be read under the supposition that the trial had proceeded the witnesses had been heard and that the pleadings of my counsel were finished for under this supposition it was written  Newmanstreet  Dec th  NARRATIVE OF FACTS  IT was in the month of November that I first became a member of the Society for Constitutional Information The multitude of great events which at that period had happened in France incited people of all ranks to political inquiry and men were roused by a perception of one of the most palpable of truths which yet seemed as it were a recent discovery that the political institutes of all nations essentially influence the morals and the happiness of the people and that these institutes are capable of improvement The good was no sooner perceived than an eagerness to enjoy it was begotten and this eagerness was frequently  so impatient as to excite a dread that though it could not defeat it might painfully retard its own purpose  At length the sluggish apprehensions of those men whose powers of mind are small and prejudices great were awakened Their numbers considerable their wealth enormous their influence universal and their appetites and passions almost the sole means to them of happiness they no sooner saw danger than they conceived disgust for the supposed authors of it and this disgust rapidly quickened into hatred Animosity once conceived is generally mutual and the acrimony was distinctly seen to increase and to be pregnant with pernicious effects  Under such circumstances it became the duty of every man to think seriously and act with vigour Passengers in a storm labour at the pump are upbraided if they linger and in danger of being thrown overboard if they refuse Individual and general safety are the same and the man who is not trusted with the helm may yet aid to heave or cast the anchor  Believing that all men and all actions contribute more or less to the general good or harm I had long been accustomed in the efforts of which I was capable to keep that food in view Stimulated by the considerations I have mentioned and by the daily events that pressed with accumulating astonishment on the mind I ardently applied myself to the study of man and the means of promoting his welfare and lessening his evils as connected with political institutes Of the rectitude of my intentions and the wisdom or folly of my endeavours my fellow citizens must judge by the few proofs I have been able to afford At least I was assiduous in my inquiries and the principles in which I was consirmed by them impelled me to communicate some part of that truth which I imagined to be eminently beneficial  The chief of these principles are that man is happy in proportion as he is truly informed that his ignorance is not a fault but a misfortune because his quantity of knowledge is inevitably the result of  the circumstances under which he exists that to be angry with him therefore to treat him unkindly and to punish him is criminal in other words is erroneous that to instruct him and while instructing to convince him of the benevolence of the teacher's intentions is the only way to cure him of his mistakes and diminish the commission of crimes that in proportion as he advances in the knowledge of facts he will increase the means of happiness and that as facts are unlimited in number and variety but still are subject to certain unvarying laws the increase of his happiness is likewise certain yet unlimited  Being convinced that these are indubitable truths I necessarily became the opponent of all violence and a determined friend to the publication of truth since by that alone the wellbeing of man can be promoted Soon after I entered this Society I was asked by an inquirer like myself after he had stated that such societies decide whether propositions are right or wrong by vote whether truth depended on a majority  whether if a nation were unanimously to vote that a part is greater than the whole their decision could alter the fact and if not why did I join in the practice of error  To this I replied with satisfaction to myself though not to him that the absurdity of supposing facts could be affected by opinions was evident but that such societies did exist and till men should be better informed would continue to exist that the rule he suggested appeared to exclude all the men who were best calculated to prevent such societies in their too great ardour to do good from doing ill that collecting votes was a mode of estimating the public opinion a thing in itself highly desirable if it could be collected in a rational manner and that if I refused to act with men so long as they should be guilty of mistake I must banish myself wholly from their society  I say then I entered this society with a firm determination to use every endeavour to prevent violence and acrimony to communicate the truth I knew or imagined I  knew to stimulate others to do the same and to interfere as little as possible with the framing of propositions that were to be determined on by vote Accordingly while I remained a member which if the society be supposed still to exist I still remain I never framed a single resolution or excited others to the publication of any thing except of those facts that I believed would conduce to the wellbeing of man When questions were put I sometimes voted and sometimes spoke to declare my opinion but was much oftener silent occasionally because I thought them frivolous but more freuqently because they were in my apprehension such a mixture of right and wrong as to leave me undecided  Little did I imagine it would be possible to accuse the inefficient proceedings of this society as treasonable still less that I should be selected as one of the most wicked of these conspiring traitors We conspired indeed but it was to do all the good in our power and the thing we had most to deprecate and of which we were weak  enough to accuse ourselves collectively was that our power was so small  The apprehensions of Government were first publicly announced in the proclamation of the st of May and the coercive measures on which it had determined immediately appeared in parliamentary addresses and the measures of the magistrates and municipal officers throughout the kingdom Associations were formed and the danger of the constitution from the wicked attempts of republicans and levellers became the cry of what has been called the aristocratic party I say what has been called because I am not a friend to any word with which ideas of animosity and violence shall be associated So active were these selfdeclared friends of Government and so loud in their asseverations of approaching ruin the destruction of property insurrection and anarchy that the quiet people who erroneously imagine they have no interest whatever in the affairs of government that is the greatest part of the nation began to partake of the fears of these  agitators and the deception was carried to so strange a height that Ministry by more proolamations asserted in the face of the world that insurrections did actually exist which the militia was called out to quell at a moment when not a hand or foot was stirring on any such pretences within the confines of Great Britain They seemed to have reiterated the cry of fire till they had convinced themselvesthat the world was in flames and for my own part I have little doubt but that they were guilty of the incredible folly of supposing that these insurrections were really combining and on the eve of bursting forth That they did actually exist they must know to be a falsehood The mistake therefore of which they were guilty was in affirming even more than they themselves believed  Fear and infatuation having once seized the mind its bewildered faculties run riot and consequences the most absurd and most deplorable are ever likely to be the result Prosecutions were immediately commenced throughout the kingdom Every county  assize and quarter sessions condemned some poor ignorant enthusiast to imprisonment for follies at which infancy or idiotism scarcely could have taken fright and men of respectable characters and honest intentions in the fury of their newborn zeal thought it a heroical act of duty to watch the conduct of their very intimates excite them to utter what have been opprobriously called seditious and treasonable words and afterward to turn informers against the intemperance they had provoked To avoid giving any opinion not to mention that such silence would have been dastardly and hypocritical was almost impossible Language the most outrageous was employed to make those who were in the least suspected declare their creed and if it were not entirely accommodating the peaceable citizen after being entrapped was insulted and turned nay frequently kicked out of taprooms coffeehouses and public places  The impotence of the persecuted party was every where demonstrated yet the outcry of alarm increased Church and  King mobs were proved in public courts of justice to have been encouraged by the very men whose office it was to keep the peace and at Birmingham the deluded people who had first been led to riot by a mistaken zeal in support of Government again rose in insurrection to avoid paying the assessments which their former leaders levied on them for the outrages they had before committed And for this superinduced riot many of them have been brought to the foot of the gallows  Nor was this the only occasion on which the Birmingham people followed the lesson of anarchy they had been taught They discovered their supposed power and rose to rid the town of all houses of ill fame So dangerous is it to teach lessons of violence to well meaning but uninformed men  In sine it is a fact well worthy remark that no insurrection or shade of insurrection has appeared on the part of the people wishing reform and that Birmingham Bristol Mountstreet and Charingcross are all public instances of riots excited by  the misconduct of persons who derived the authority under which they acted from Government It may therefore be soberly and truly affirmed that if there have been traitors the crime will rest upon those who have been the accusers  With respect to the riots of pressgangs sailors and coalheavers they originate in practices which surely it is the duty of Government to inquire into and to remedy But they were merely repetitions of events that had but too frequently happened before and therefore could not be justly attributed to the immediate interference of either party  Proceeding in the same spirit printers and booksellers all over the kingdom were hunted out for prosecution and the tempest of insurrection and anarchy was so considently affirmed to be rising and raging that the House of Commons voted the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Bill on the affirmation that dangerous and treasonable conspiracies did actually exist  Future ages will find it difficult to believe  that Government through its agents could condescend to use the means which were resorted to that this spirit might be kept alive and that the hatred already generated between friends families societies and sects might continue and increase Many of its partisans openly affirmed it was desirable that the contest should be brought to an issue and thousands of pamphlets were dispersed gratis all of an inflammatory kind to produce this effect Nay Long Lane and Stonecutter Street formerly the mart for the last dying speeches of malefactors were inlisted in the cause and ballad singers were drilled paid and stationed at the ends of streets to chaunt the downfall of the Jacobins the glorious administration of Mr Pitt and the victories of the Duke of York If but one of them dared to sing a stave in favour of any thing that looked like freedom he or she was taken up and committed to the house of correction I myself witnessed numberless scenes of this kind and once in particular saw five  vociferous fellows not meanly dressed with cockades in their hats shouting the contents of papers meant to excite the lower people to that acrimony which had it been completely effected as it was in part must have ended in mischief and horror  The caricature printfellers too were obliged to take their former wares from their windows and every device of bleeding heads cannibals devouring human bodies and inventions almost too detestable for conception was substituted to enrage the nation  The very ballad fingers whom I have mentioned gave away with the halfpenny song they sold engravings on copper of the Queen of France one of which among many other curiosities of this kind I purchafed  These things must have been the work of Government Five men could not have found it their interest so to dress themselves up and proclaim through the streets the  crimes and villanies of the Jacobins and the virtues of Administration I walked with them as long as my time would permit and saw that it was not the sale on which they depended Long Lane never before gave copperplate engravings distinct from the song with ballads which are sold as I believe for three pence the double quire  With respect to the society of which I was a member it seemed with these progressive events to increase in amazement and I may almost say in stupefaction This was visible in the thinness of its meetings its inefficient efforts and long adjournments Each man saw himself the butt of obloquy Each man knew that Mr Reeves's association was sitting in a room of the same tavern immediately over his head and that this association was the focus of the opprobrium cast on them all They supposed themselves to be watched by the very waiters Thus hunted down is it much to be wondered at was it very criminal that some petulant ebullitions occasionally  burst forth Was the very nothing that they did guilt so enormous Was it high treason  For my own part when a few of its members were first taken into custody I felt astonishment which no words can describe Surely said I either there have been practices of which I am totally ignorant or men are running mad Yet in spite of truth in spite of probability the aspect of these proceedings became increasingly serious and to a man who should entertain the general tenacious love of life terrific The persons apprehended were severally and some of them repeatedly examined before the Privy Council The three estates of the kingdom had declared the existence of treason and conspiracy and the nation seemed generally to credit the assertion I several times had information that a warrant was issued against me Incredible as the rumour would have been at any other moment I now believed it to be true  Conscious of absolute innocence my immediate conclusion was that the persons  in custody were no traitors Many of them I knew had been warm in discourse and did not hold the commonly supposed visionary principles held by me and which necessarily and inevitably prevent the commission of treason but some of them I had frequently met and had mixed more or less in company with most of them and I had never heard a whisper of conspiring or of any plan for having recourse to arms Far was I from supposing that an endeavour to stimulate the nation to declare in favour of a parliamentary reform contained the seeds of rebellion and the death of the King I heard unguarded expressions sometimes that had been provoked by actual persecution but never a word so rash as to insinuate such a guilty intention I met no man who was so void of understanding as to suppose this was the true means of promoting reform They all knew that if the Monarch were to die he had an heir to succeed and it was not the change of the King but the change of the House of Commons that as far as I was  acquainted with their designs had been their general object  Many surmises and tales prevailed during the summer of the memorable The Reports of the Secret Committee had been read and numbers asserted with reason that their contents furnished no proofs to justify the vote of the House of Commons which affirmed that a treasonable conspiracy did exist One week the supposed traitors were immediately to be brought to trial the next it was said the Crown lawyers had declared that a case of treason could not be made out and that they would be tried for seditious practices At another time the rumour was that they would not be brought to the bar but kept in prison till the expiration of the Suspension Act  The chief emotion that I felt was something of the same kind with those for which I have so often been taxed as a visionary I most earnestly wished I might be summoned before the Privy Council Not to give them information of treasonable practices  for I had none to give but that I might with a collected cool and determined mind lay before them if I could but prevail on them to hear me the dangerous consequences of the measures they were about to pursue This wish was so ardent in me that notwithstanding its apparent extravagance in supposing that I should be able to alter the opinions of the Privy Council I several times mentioned it to my family and friends  A warrant having been issued against me for such a warrant the messenger who has it in possession has repeatedly acknowledged was issued made it probable that I should be examined and I had therefore prepared myself for the event The late John Hunter and other medical men had prescribed seabathing for me and at the first period of the report of this warrant my affairs would have permitted me to have been absent a short time from town But I determined not to go and took care to appear publicly that it might be ascertained I had no desire to evade inquiry  At length when the affair seemed almost to have sunk into forgetfulness it was suddenly revived and a commission was appointed on the till then supposed highly improbable charge of High Treason The proceeding astonished me but I had no suspicion it could be intended that I should be involved in it It is true I had no conception how the persons imprisoned should be convicted of a treasonable conspiracy But they had been apprehended had been examined had been committed Unaccountable rumours indeed had prevailed concerning me still as I had never been called upon never interrogated and as my principles were from the zeal with which I cherish and endeavour to communicate them publicly known to so many persons I could not but imagine myself even in these times of incredible suspicion an unsuspected man  Soon however to my utter astonishment assertions to the contrary were spread and many serious reflections suggested themselves to my mind Surely said I  this age has more general information and therefore more virtue more wisdom than the past There cannot be another mealtub plot No Titus Oates could now impose his execrable fictions on mankind Yet what am I to think I who if it were not an absurdity to suppose that blood would appease and purify the vicious would willingly shed my blood to teach them benevolence and truth I who from my heart so enthusiastically desire to promote good will among men I who know too that this fact has for I did then know that it had been given in evidence before the Privy Council If I can be included in an indictment for High Treason how can I foretell what it is that cannot be I recollected that the House of Commons had been led by ministry and the adherents of ministry to pass an act asserting that a treasonable conspiracy did exist and I conceived that sophistry might easily argue with itself that it were better twelve or it may be twelve hundred any indefinite number of men who were the partisans  of reform should die than that the three estates of the kingdom should suffer the ignominy which men might otherwise affert had been incurred To some persons even of the present day I was well aware there would be more than plausibility in such an argument there would be conviction  The approaching contest I saw was big with tremendous consequences and I seriously meditated on the part it became me and every man to act At one moment I could not be brought to conceive myself in danger at the next the facts that stared me in the face destroyed every ground of rational calculation and left me bewildered in suspense But a fatal and a mighty blow was aimed at the very essence of social wellbeing and nothing but the fortitude of the individuals accused and the understanding which I still believed existed in the nation could avert the danger  This narrative is a history of my own motives and conduct written in order that I may be justified to the world and may not  lose that utility of which the loss of the world's esteem would deprive me I therefore insert the following letter which will afford some sketch of what my thoughts and feelings were at this awful period It was written to my son and daughter who reside in Devonshire and as several of their letters addressed to me have miscarried it is not improbable that it has already been read by the agents of ministry  My dear friends and children  The reason of my writing to you at this moment is to prevent any unnecessary alarm to which indeed I hope you would not have been very liable even if I had not written and if you had previously heard the strange intelligence I am about to communicate through any other channel It is asserted in the Morning Post of today and I have before received the same information from various people that a bill is to be presented to the Grand Jury containing a charge of High Treason  against thirteen persons of whom I am one As it is impossible that either this or any other imputed crime against the Government can be proved on me my principles and practice having been so totally opposite to such supposed crimes I hope and most seriously recommend that you will feel the same tranquillity I do The charge is so false and so absurd that it has not once made my heart beat For my own part I feel no enmity against those who endeavour thus to injure me being persuaded that in this as in all other instances it is but the guilt of ignorance They think they are doing their duty I will continue to do mine to the very utmost of my power and on that will cheerfully rest my safety I must again conjure you both to feel neither alarm nor uneasiness Remember the most virtuous of men are liable to be misunderstood and falsely accused But the virtuous man has no need to fear accusation If it be true that my name is in the Indictment it will oblige me again  to defer the happiness of seeing you and the hope of recruiting my health by the excursion Of the latter it is true I have need and to be a witness of your happiness would give me no small pleasure but the man of fortitude knows how to submit to all necessities and if he be wise frequently to turn events which others consider as most disastrous to some beneficent end Shall I own to you that though I could not wish to be falsely accused yet being so accused I now feel an anxious desire to be heard Let my principles and actions be inquired into and published if they have been erroneous let them become moral lessons to others if the reverse the instruction they will afford may more effectually answer the same purpose I hope  Sophy  you know something of me endeavour to communicate what you know to Mr Cole and your mutual fears will then surely be very few Observe that as I have yet received no notice whatever from Government I have the above intelligence only  from report If it be false I shall soon be with you if the contrary you of course will hear from me the moment I have any thing to communicate Be happy act virtuously and disdain to live the slaves of fear  Newmanstreet  Sept th  I likewise sent the following letter on the same day as directed and though it was made public on the next it is a kind of document which I think I ought not to omit  To the Editor of the Morning Post  Sir  In your paper of yesterday my name is mentioned among those said to be inserted in a bill to be presented to a Grand Jury on Thursday next containing charges of High Treason If this be the fact I have no wish to influence public opinion by a previous affirmation of my own innocence I desire only to appear before  my country However as I have not been a day absent from home for more than twelve months and never received from any magistrate the least intimation of any suspicion against me till I have official notice my own consciousness obliges me to consider your intelligence as unfounded  In either case it is a duty I owe myself to declare that I am now and always shall be ready to answer every accusation  Newmanstreet  Sept th  The seesaw of contradictory reports concerning me some affirming and some denying kept me a few days longer in suspense A daily paper indeed asserted and as it professed with authority that the rumour of my being indicted was absolutely false and a friend who had determined should it prove true to give me every aid in his power quitted town the very day before the bill was returned I was preparing to  do the same Not only he indeed but all my friends as well as myself had concluded that the report would prove to be false it being so excessively improbable  In this mistake I remained till Monday October th at three in the afternoon when another friend came running to inform me that he had that moment come from Hicks's Hall where he had been present and heard an indictment for High Treason read against twelve persons of whom I was one I know not how to describe my sensations I can only say it was those principles which I so earnestly recommended to others that preserved me from excessive indignation excessive alarm or any other passion that at such a time might have been fatal  My friend felt less determined He was a man of an acute mind but a lawyer and knowing the equivocal spirit of law and the hazard incurred from the ignorance or prejudice even of the best intentioned jurymen he advised immediate flight I had no great difficulty however in convincing him that  I had already determined on the measures I should take  In this disposition he rather unwillingly left me but he had no hope from farther argument I then communicated the event with as much caution as possible to my family And here I had a more painful scene to sustain My father in a passionate burst of tears intreaties and interjections conjured me to fly His age and the circumstances under which he had lived had rendered him a very unfit counsellor for such an occasion and the only means I had of calming his agitated spirits was by the firmness of my own behaviour my declared resolution to face my accusers from which no power on earth should turn me and my appeal to his own knowledge of me of how far it was possible I could be thus guilty  The coolness with which I acted inspired my parents and children with courage I thought it prudent however to leave them that I might consult with my own mind and with some friends concerning the properest mode of surrendering myself and  learning that the court was to meet the next day at Hicks's Hall I went to the house of my solicitor and friend Mr Foulkes where with some other persons whose conduct in this affair has been manly altogether and to me in particular affectionate I supped I did not return home but slept here  The next morning I appeared in court accompanied by my solicitor and another gentleman of the law where as soon as the business of the court would permit I thus addressed myself to Lord Chief Justice Eyre  Mr Holcroft  "My Lord being informed that a bill for High Treason has been preferred against me Thomas Holcroft by his Majesty's Attorney General and returned a true bill by a Grand Jury of these realms I come to surrender myself to this court and my country to be put upon my trial that if I am a guilty man the whole extent of my guilt may become notorious and if innocent that the rectitude of my principles and conduct may be no less public And I hope my Lord there is no appearance  pearance of vaunting in assuring your Lordship this court and my country that after the misfortune of having been suspected as an enemy to the peace and happiness of mankind there is nothing on earth after which as an individual I more ardently aspire than a sull fair and public examination  "I have further to request that your Lordship will inform me if it be not the practice in these cases to assign counsel and to suffer the accused to speak in his own defence Likewise whether free egress or regress be not allowed to such persons books and papers as the accused or his counsel shall deem necessary for justification"  Chief Justice  "With regard to the first sir it will be the duty of the court to assign you counsel and also to order that such counsel shall have free access to you at all proper hours With respect sir to the liberty of speaking for yourself the accused will be fully heard by himself as well as by his counsel but with regard to papers  books and other things of that kind it is impossible for me to say any thing precisely until the thing required be asked However sir you may depend upon it every thing will be granted to the party accused so as to enable him to make his defence If I understand you rightly you now admit that you are the person standing indicted by the name of Thomas Holcroft"  Mr Holcroft  "That indeed my Lord is what I cannot affirmI have it only from report"  Chief Justice  "You come here to surrender yourself and I can only accept of that surrender on the supposition that you are the person so indicted You know the consequence sir of being indicted for High Treason I shall be under the necessity of ordering you into custody I would not wish to take any advantage of your coming forward in person indiscreetly in this manner without being called upon by the ordinary processes of the law You should have a moment to consider whether you surrender yourself as that person"  Mr Holcroft  "It is certainly not my wish either to inflict upon myself unnecessary punishment or to put myself in unnecessary danger I come only as Thomas Holcroft of Newman Street in the county of Middlesex and I certainly do not wish to stand more forward than an innocent man ought to stand"  Chief Justice  "I cannot enter into this point If you admit yourself to be the person indicted the consequence must be that I must order you to be taken into custody to answer this charge I do not know whether you are or are not Thomas Holcroft I do not know you and therefore it is impossible for me to know whether you are the person stated in the indictment"  Mr Holcroft  "It is equally impossible for me my lord"  Chief Justice  "Why then sir I think you had better sit stillIs there any thing moved on the part of the Crown with respect to this gentleman"  Solicitor General  "My lords as I consider  him to be the person against whom a true bill is found I move that he be committed"  Chief Justice  "I do not know how many persons there may be of the name of Thomas Holcroft it would be rather extraordinary to commit a person on this charge if we do not know him  This produced a short consultation between the Solicitor General the other counsel for the Crown and Mr White They were evidently surprised and not pleased at my appearance and one of them Mr Knapp began an argument to prove that I admitted mysels to be the person indicted He was interrupted by the Chief Justice who again asked if the counsel for the Crown thought fit to move that I should be committed which was accordingly moved by the Solicitor General and I was taken into custody by a Sheriff's officer Mr Cawdron of Ironmonger Lane  After naming Messieurs Erskine and Gibbs for my counsel I asked the Bench whether a person employed to write for me  might have access to me in prison and this question introduced another short dialogue  Chief Justice  "That is a sort of thing that is quite new I do not know that I can grant it unless something be stated by you sir with respect to your health to make it requisite"  Mr Holcroft  "That was not my motive for inquiring nor did I imagine I had demanded any thing that was not customary My reason for asking was that I have been used to dictate to an amanuensis and it would be extremely convenient for me to enjoy the same advantage while I shall be preparing my defence"  Chief Justice  "I am afraid sir it is contrary to custom It will be proper for you to apply to another quarter which can better grant such an indulgence than I can sitting in this court"  Mr Holcroft  "My lord I neither ask nor wish for any indulgence I only ask and wish for justice"  Chief Justice  "Then sir I cannot make the order"  After this the Court adjourned but I was detained perhaps three quarters of an hour the reason of which was as I was informed that the warrant was making out though I believe five minutes would have been quite sussicient for that purpose and the truth I believe to be that the crown lawyers were consulting how I was to be treated and sending to the higher powers for instructions The following circumstances are the foundation of my belief  About half past one o'clock the same day a person came to my house in Newman Street inquired if I was at home and seemed at first unwilling to tell his business or rather was undecided probably from not having received precise orders He first said he came from Mr Munden but being questioned by my daughters denied that he was the friend of Mr Munden and pretended that he had been with him to inquire my place of abode He repeatedly asked my daughters if they were sure I was not at home and they by this time suspecting  him to be an officer sent to take me replied he might search the house though he might be assured I was not at home for that I had never taught them to tell untruths and to prove their sincerity added that I was gone to the Privy Council to surrender myself No answered he that he certainly is not  for I am but just come from the Privy Council  He then shewed his watch that they might take notice it was half past one o'clock My daughters replied Perhaps they were mistaken and if so I was gone to the Old Bailey The truth was they knew I intended to surrender myself but did not know where  He being then understood to be a messenger they asked if he intended to come in and take my papers for on shewing his authority he was at liberty to make any search He replied that  there was quite sufficient without my papers  speaking probably the language that was prevalent concerning the persons accused among the prosecutors and their retainers  after which he departed saying that if I had surrendered myself it would save him trouble  These facts being related to me led me to conclude that a messenger had been dispatched from Hicks's Hall to the Privy Council and that to preserve the decorum of authority this person had then been sent to my house for the effrontery of surrendering myself appears by the prosecutors and their partisans to have been thought intolerable But that is a question which the reader will find discussed hereafter However while in Newgate I stated these circumstances and my conjectures to some of the prisoners and one of the turnkeys being present said it had happened as I had surmised and that he knew a messenger was dispatched from Hicks's Hall to the Privy Council on that business  After waiting as I have said at Hicks's Hall the warrant at last appeared and I was attended to Newgate by the officer and one of the under sheriffs both of whom  behaved with great politeness to me And here instead of being committed to close confinement like the other persons accused I was allowed the same liberty of walking the court yard and visiting my fellow prisoners which is granted to persons confined for inferior crimes I was determined to make no application for the sum of thirteen and four pence per week which was allowed to the persons who had been imprisoned in the Tower and accordingly I received the common prison allowance of the persons confined for sedition and misdemeanor which is three halfpenny worth of bread per day and no more I do not attribute this to any desire in the prosecutors to treat me with additional severity for they had demonstrated the contrary but as a trait to shew how negligent those who punish are of the attention that is always due to people punished and whom without intending additional injury they might and I believe frequently do leave to perish I state this as one of the inevitable evils of a system of punishment and common  to all countries though perhaps better guarded againt in this than in many  Locked within the walls of Newgate I had full leisure for meditation and my thoughts were intensely fixed on the state of the kingdom on the prejudices that must be prevalent or such proceedings could not have taken place and in conjectures on what might be the actual degree of error to which the persons who instigated this prosecution might be subject The prospect seemed big with danger to the peace and freedom of mankind and the only rational mode of averting it was a cool yet active fortitude To defend myself by shewing the falsehood of the accusation was a duty but it was a duty which at this moment I knew not how to discharge I had no documents nor could I tell of what I was accused  I had remained in this suspense a few days when Mr Kirby the keeper of Newgate one morning came desired me to follow him and led me through the otherwise  impassable gates to an apartment in his own house Here I was introduced to Mr White the Solicitor for the Treasury and his two clerks and he presented me with the indictment a list of witnesses and another list of the jurymen summoned for these trials informing me at the same time that the Crown would grant as many subpoenas without expence as I should think proper to demand He assumed great politeness and I may say amenity and I have no doubt but at that moment he felt as he looked yet I could not forget the public and common assertion that Mr White has been rapidly making a fortune by the prosecutions which Government within these three years has undertaken and which it is said he has promoted with uncommon assiduity and zeal I have no doubt but that all prosecutors persuade themselves they are acting rightly I am only sorry that they cannot detect the motives by which they are too frequently frimulated I received the deathdealing instrument  he presented bowed withdrew and was reconducted to my place of confinement  My ardour to examine the charges brought against me the list of the witnesses who were my accusers and the names of the men by some of whom I was to be tried may well be imagined but not the astonishment I felt after scrutinizing the contents I was indicted with eleven other persons in the same bill That is because I had associated with some men in the most orderly manner and with the most peaceful intentions to produce what we believed would be bencficial to mankind I was charged with the supposed for they were not real crimes of these men when or wherever they had been committed though totally without my participation or knowledge There was not a specisic statement of any action of mine but affirmations concerning the collective actions of twelve men together with other unknown conspirators which respecting myself at least I knew to be totally  and without exception false But I will forbear to dwell on this subject because I shall insert the paper which it was my intention to have read and presented to the court on the day of my arraignment as a protest against this whole proceeding In the mean time I drew up a plan of the manner in which if my counsel should agree in opinion with me I should wish to have my defence conducted It was as follows  PLAN OF DEFENCE  Submitted by me to Messieurs  ERSKINE  and  GIBBS  To insist that to obtain a reform was a virtuous attempt  That to obtain a reform peaceably I held it would be necessary to prove it to be the wish of the nation  That when it was proposed by the Corresponding and Constitutional Societies to call a Convention my first step was to  require that documents should be brought to prove a Convention to be the wish of the nation  That this Convention had it been called would have attested whether a reform of Parliament were or were not the wish of the nation  That through the whole procedure I kept not only my own mind but the minds of others intent on the virtue and wisdom of using none but peaceable means  That I was indefatigable in propagating the system of peace among friends children servants associators democrats aristocrats and especially the young and the violent of all parties That among democrats I maintained the absurdity of opposing force by force of establishing a system of benevolence by terror and of coercing those that were not convinced among aristocrats I endeavoured to demonstrate the vice of war violence prosecution imprisonment death and coercion of every kind that I hold death punishment and all coercion by whomsoever inflicted to be vice  that instruction is the sole means of happiness and that entire freedom of speech and of the press are necessary for the conveying of instruction that I was willing to suffer at all times for speaking or writing what I conceived to be the truth and that if violence were offered to me I would suffer with patience and without resentment my only end being to correct the mistakes of men and among others of my prosecutors however alive my feelings may be to their enormity  That I did not hold those kind of associations which pretend to determine what is truth by putting propositions to the vote to be wise for no majority however large can alter the nature of truth but that I knew such associations did exist and soresaw that till men should become more enlightened they would continue to exist that to absent myself from them I conceived to be a failure of duty for if none but the ill informed and men who should act rather from momentary feeling than from the foresight of inquiry were left wholly without  the advice which men of deeper reflection might afford they would but be the oftener exposed to mistake  At length the prisoners whose names were in one indictment were brought from the Tower and we heard that we were to be arraigned on Saturday October the th In the mean time I had sent the protest which I intended to read and deliver to the Court to my counsel and they returned a message entreating me as I respected the lives of other men to forbear They were too deeply engaged to come themselves for they had indeed incredible fatigues to sustain and I therefore was ignorant of their reasons though for my own part I could not nor can I see how this paper would have been dangerous to any man However the argument they urged was of such moment that I ceded without being convinced which I consider as an error The paper was as follows  PROTEST  Against the  INDICTMENT  and  LIST  of  WITNESSES  I conceive that the Indictment is most unjust and flagitious It combines heterogeneous actions meetings accusations and persons that ought all to have been kept free from confusion I make this remark because it is my duty without intending any the most minute shade of censure on my fellow sufferers Indeed the conduct of no two individuals ever was or ever can be the same they therefore ought not to be confounded Every possible means of avoiding error should be conscientiously scrupulously and minutely avoided more particularly by those who prosecute in order to inflict punishment and that punishment being no less than the loss of life To protest against such conduct in prosecutors is the duty not only of the prosecuted but of every human being Precedents so destructive to every man living and to all future  men while men shall continue to act as they erroneously do at present from precedent ought not to be left upon record I doubt whether every virtuous man ought not rather to suffer death than to plead to such an indictment  To me the confusion is inexplicable and of all fatal means to involve innocence this is among the most fatal A promiscuous list of two hundred and eight witnesses is given me ninetenths of whom are utter strangers to me in person abode and even name and of the whole not one has to my knowledge any possible charge of guilt to bring against me Yet I am lest to conjecture if I can who are my accusers or of what they can accuse me I say I may conjecture if I can but I cannot I have no guide No duty can be more facred than that of declaring to a man whose life is put in jeopardy by accusation and as he himself well knows by faise accusation or it could not have been in jeopardy I say no duty can be more sacred than that of informing him who are his accusers He is  afloat on the sea of prosecution and his prosecutors who lay claim to pure undeviating justice have taken means which they cannot but know are the most certain to harass and bewilder him and by which in despite of innocence he may finally perish Such is individually the situation of every man arraigned under this confused inexplicable and unjust indictment I therefore protest against its iniquity and appeal to justice not because I have any fears for myself but because I would not without appeal leave such a pernicious instrument on record  The Tuesday following the trials began and perhaps this country never witnessed a moment more portentous The hearts and countenances of men seemed pregnant with doubt and terror They waited in something like a stupor of amazement for the fearful sentence on which their deliverance or their destruction seemed to depend Never surely was the public mind more profoundly agitated The whole power  of Government was directed against Thomas Hardy in his fate seemed involved the fate of the nation and the verdict of Not Guilty appeared to have burst its bonds and to have released it from inconceivable miseries and ages of impending slavery The acclamations of the Old Bailey reverberated from the farthest shores of Scotland and the whole people felt the enthusiastic transports of recovered freedom  For my own part though few men participated more amply in the general joy than I did I can truly say it was not because I supposed myself a party It was a conviction which I could never work upon myself that my accusers ever had any intention of producing evidence against me Yet I knew how dangerous it would be should I be deceived and found unprepared I therefore laboured with the same ardour at my defence as if I had been really persuaded I should be brought to trial and the belief that I should not was the only thought that gave me pain To be thus publicly accused and not as publicly heard to have it  supposed through the kingdom that I was involved in all the guilt which they had imputed to other men but could not prove that is in transactions of which I had never heard till the reports of the Secret Committee were published and in which I had no concern whatever direct or indirect this I own was an evil which I would have given my right hand to have avoided But I too plainly foresaw what afterward happened that I was not to be heard I hoped that so much respect at least would have been paid to justice as that I should have been permitted to state a few facts in the open court concerning myself by which means they would have best been circulated through the kingdom For this purpose and that I might well weigh my assertions and not make myself liable to the mistakes either of memory or of erroneous feeling that is not more liable than I am in my coolest moments I arranged my thoughts and committed them to paper The following is the address I intended to have delivered at the bar of the Old Bailey  on the morning when the Jury were directed to acquit me the Attorney General having declared his intention of not calling any witnesses to prove the treason charged against me and three other persons in the indictment  Gentlemen of the Jury  Before I quit this place I think myself obliged by the most sacred of duties to say a few words to you I will not long intrude upon your time but a wish to deter men from error and mischief by a simple statement of facts will not suffer me to depart in total silence Let me however preface what I have to say by a solemn declaration that as far as I am acquainted with my own motives I am not stimulated however great may have been the injustice I have suffered by any sentiments of vengeance or desire of retaliation  You are directed Gentlemen to acquit me This was an event which I have continually foretold It could not be otherwise unless methods had been practised  too flagrant even for the mistaken men who have brought me and so many others into the present horrid predicament that of having our own lives and the liberties of the nation exposed to the desperate hazard of being contended for by the errors passions and prejudices of men This acquittal without an examination though long foreseen was the thing I had most to dread Gentlemen notwithstanding you now cannot but feel why our prosecutors do not bring us to trial you will yet perhaps find some difficulty in believing the facts I am about to state relative to myself The principal of these facts is that my prosecutors knew that instead of being a traitor a mover of war and insurrection and a killer of kings I say they had proof that I was a man whose principles and practice were the very reverse Evidence was given before the Privy Council of these facts and they had no evidence whatever nor the slightest shadow of evidence that I was a perturbator of the public peace You need not be told Gentlemen  that it is the general opinion of mankind that force can be no way effectually repelled but by force This though the general opinion of mankind is not my opinion and my prosecutors had evidence that it is not my opinion They had evidence that in the Constitutional Society of which I am a member and under pretence of which they have indicted me for High Treason I was theoretically the adversary of all force in all possible cases and that practically I concurred with the members who were most desirous of promoting reform in urging that it must be done by the peaceable means of persuasion by the conviction of the understanding and not by the force of arms not by Tower muskets not by Sheffield pikes not by bread and cheese knivesOf such weapons Gentlemen I do most solemnly assure you and may my memory be execrated by all good men to all posterity if I speak with the least equivocation or mental reserve I say Gentlemen I do thus most solemnly assure you that I never either heard such wicked  means of compulsion proposed or that such things were in existence except in the avowed and public way in which all men know that knives and muskets do exist  Gentlemen the principal witness examined concerning me before the Privy Council was Mr Sharp the engraver a man whose testimony has already been so amply detailed in the late trial before this Court as a witness for the Crown and of whose integrity there is no shadow of doubt Knowing that he had been examined I wrote to him on Saturday last to request he would state under his own hand what his examination had been respecting me This is his answer  '  Copy from my Testimony which I signed at the Privy Council  '  The Society for Constitutional Information adjourned and left the delegates in the room The most gentlemanlike person of the Corresponding Society took the chair and talked about an equal  representation of the people and of putting and end to war Holcroft talked about the Powers of the Human Mind  This is the whole that I signedThe particulars that I remember of that conversation before the Privy Council are I believe nearly as follow Mr Holcroft talked a great deal about Peace of his being against any violent or coercive means that were usually resorted to against our Fellow Creatures urged the more powerful operation of Philosophy and Reason to convince man of his errors that he would disarm his greatest enemy by those means and oppose his fury Spoke also about  Truth  being powerful c c and gave advice to the above effect to the delegates present who  all  seemed to agree as no person opposed his arguments This conversation lasted  better than an hour  and we departed The next time the delegates met Holcroft was  not  present This is the substance of 'what I remember of that conversation  Mr Sharp was again examined before  the Grand Jury and this is what he writes  Before the Grand Jury I mentioned Mr Holcroft's disposition and conversation when we met about reasoning men out of their errors who was a sort of natural Quaker and was for the peaceable means that philosophy and reason point out to  convince  mankind He was  against violence of all kinds  but did not believe in the secret impulses of the spirit like the Quakers  Mr Symmonds another witness for the Crown gave positive and pointed evidence before the Privy Council to the very active part I took when it was proposed to call a Convention in prevailing on the Society for Constitutional Information to change the word Convention for the word Meeting This I urged and this Mr Horne Tooke and the whole society agreed to with the express and declared purpose of preventing misinterpretation and of proving even by the choice of a word that so far from wishing to terrify we were anxious to  convince all mankind that our plans and intentions were wholly peaceable  Whether Mr Adams the Secretary were or were not examined concerning me I do not know If he were not let the men who have instituted these inquiries and this prosecution account for such remissness if they can and if he were I am certain what the nature of his testimony must be His brother whom I saw yesterday informed me that he had several times heard Mr Adams declare his utter astonishment that I in particular could be indicted because of the repeated and ardent manner in which he and every body had heard me declare my sentiments in favour of peace and nonresistance  These facts Gentlemen are known to all the members of the Constitutional Society and had I been tried I should have brought numerous and highly respectable persons of all parties to depose to their truth  Gentlemen I have stated these facts to you because they seem to me so awful so  pernicious so alarming to the liberties of the nation and to have been conceived and executed with such unexampled acrimony and violence that should they be suffered to pass in silence and unexamined every man among us will be guilty of unpardonable neglect  Rash as in my opinion the proceedings of Government have been yet surely they never would have been rash to this extreme had it not been taken for granted that seeing myself threatened by power so formidable and as at that moment it appeared so unlimited I should not have dared however conscious of my own innocence to abide the dangerous issue Either they concluded that I should have fled and that my terror would have given some sanction to their tyranny I hope Gentlemen I do not call it by too harsh a nameeither they thought themselves certain of this or I own to me their actions are totally incomprehensible That they calculated deeply on constructive treason the late trials have now rendered as visible as the  noon day sun But that they could imagine any Jury could see a man brought before them of whose peaceable principles and conduct the prosecutors had the proof that I have cited and not feel indignation inexpressible is folly too great to be attributed even to these infatuated governors of twelve millions of men  Remember Gentlemen into what a situation their own temerity had brought them The honour of Parliament the veracity of the Secret Committee and perhaps the existence of the Ministry depended on proving that no falsehood had been voted on that memorable occasion when the whole Legislature decreed that a dangerous conspiracy did exist in this kingdom Woe be to the kingdom where the Ministry can lead the Legislature thus to decree thus to prejudge thus to endanger the lives and liberties of millions and can be suffered to enjoy the means of repeating such unjust and portentous decrees I do not mean Gentlemen that I would have them punished  I have not a wish to do by them as they have strained every nerve to do by a few feeble individuals I am as much an enemy to halters and axes as I am to muskets and pikes but I am likewise an enemy to the entrusting of such men with power That is the full and whole extent of my meaning  Gentlemen thus far I have endeavoured to call your attention to this affair only as it concerns the public at large at present I think it incumbent on me to say a few words concerning myself Every man is virtuous in proportion to his utility in society and however little men in general are aware of the important truth his public utility and his private happiness are inseparable Whoever therefore intrenches upon the utility of an individual at once offends against both public and private good The injury that has been committed on my private concerns and public utility by the proceedings of Government and the creatures of Government before and during this prosecution are such as I only can thoroughly  know and feel My fame my fortune and my family beings who have none but me for their protection and support have all deeply suffered I come not here to complain but to state facts Justice though it regards the whole concerns itself in this place only with individuals Remuneration for the injury I have sustained is in my case out of the question my prosecutors cannot call back time They can reverse attainders but they cannot reverse the mischiefs they have done Wrongs committed against one man are committed against all and not to make them known is a breach of public duty I do not unworthily seek to excite compassion or obtain a recompence The first I think a vice and the second an impossibility Our time ought to be actively employed in the removing and not wasted in the pitying of evil and injustice has no price therefore cannot be compensated But the errors of men ought to be proclaimed that they may be avoided and with this intention I proceed  Five months previous to the indictment it was publicly known that a warrant was issued against me and hanging over my head whenever they should think proper to have it served The nation through the ministerial prints was taught to consider me as something worse than a suspected person The timid shunned me the moderate regarded me with an evil eye and the violent never mentioned me but with virulence and odium I courted no party and therefore had no protectors My peace of mind indeed was invulnerable for it was shielded by conscious rectitude of intention but my resources were narrowed and I suffered evils which though I consider as trisling I find the world around me complaining of as among the bitterest that man can bear Hitherto however I had been only idly persecuted by the senseless buzz of Calumny the moment arrived when I was to meet her in a more serious form Mr Attorney General became her organ and this grave court this learned nation this enlightened age were informed that I was a conspirator  a traitor a mover of war and insurrection and a deposer of Kings and that they might rationally account for all this that I was instigated by the Devil It was well indeed that they gave me the Devil for a coadjutor or the charge would have been too ridiculous For my own part however I defy Mr Attorney General armed with all his Constructive Treasons which in the same breath he has abjured and employed I defy him aided by Constructive Treason itself to prove that I have compassed or imagined the death of the King  This strange charge Gentlemen has brought upon me the consequences I have stated Torn from my family my literary labours suspended my body imprisoned my life threatened and every exertion called forth lest it should be lost by false accusation my usual resources of subsistence were instantly swept away for I have no resources nor ever have had nor ever wish to have but in my labours  The moment when by the operation of the indictment found against me the evils I  have stated befel me was the most fatal that in my case could have happened It was when I had two pressing works to engage in and complete for the season of exhibition and publication This season is come I am wholly unprepared my time must still be engrossed by endeavours to wipe away the aspersions that have been cast on my character and the means of support for my family for I know not how long are gone  To these evils are added the law expences of this prosecution and think Gentlemen what those must be where two lists were given me of Jurors and Witnesses amounting to four hundred and thirtysix persons whose characters passions and prejudices the Solicitor and Counsel for the defence had to examine through channels the most numerous and intricate before they could be satisfied that the lives of the accused might not fall the sacrifices of mistake or perjury I and my fellow sufferers were not wallowing in affluence we could not give to our counsel with their briefs nor expend thousands and hundreds of  thousands in our defence We had no national treasury to draw upon Alas we had the wealth of the nation the prejudices of the nation and the power of the nation to encounter By what miracle could we escape The innocence of those men must be evident indeed that could endure such an inquest and withstand such an assault  Oh how cautious ought those to be whose accusation is instantly followed by imprisonment and all the anguish which the threatened loss of property character and life occasion how severe should be their inquiries into facts how conscientious the inferences they draw when consequences so serious and fatal are inevitably to result Gentlemen in an affair thus tremendous ask yourselves what would your feelings be what your fears how would you tremble lest you should be guilty of false accusation how would you interrogate and repeat interrogation in a thousand different modes even when questioning the most unprejudiced the most open the most honest witness What then would  you do with a Spy and an Informer a man whom you had taken into pay and who must accuse or must demonstrate that his ossice is useless a trained and hired perjurer  Yes indictments preferred on such evidence are indeed flagitious But what must have been the motives of those prosecutors who could employ such wicked engines persons who could so far forget all semblance of justice as to bring these accumulated wrongs on a man against whom they not only were destitute of all proof of guilt but had the actual proofs that you have heard of his innocence nay let me honestly say of his virtue  Gentlemen I have stated some of the misfortunes brought upon me by this most groundless accusation How far they are hereafter to pursue me and my family my daughters who have yet a provision to seek my aged parents who have no support but from my labours of all this I am ignorant But I shall suffer chearfully and misfortune  itself will turn to blessing if I can but lead you and all men to reflect on the nature of such cases Consider them well Being injured by Government of whom are we to seek relief If a man thinking Government culpable endeavour to correct its vices and accuse it no matter how truly what is the peril he incurs Infamy destruction death with incredible barbarity If Government suspecting a man to be culpable accuse him no matter how falsely not with an intent to correct his vices but to wreak vengeance consign to ignominy and hang draw and quarter what redress has the poor trembling hunted wretch should he happen to escape its sanguinary fangs None Who knows not the destructive nature of suits at law and where is the individual possessed of wealth enough to maintain a suit against the Treasury Of whom then is the ruined father and the destitute family to seek justice His character blasted his means consumed his labour impeded his days spent in the torments of uncertainty  his nights in the terrors which impossible endeavours to forget these torments cause to whom is he to complain  Should he on the contrary be a man whom oppression cannot shake suffering make wretched nor horrors appal whose well digested principles render him calm in adversity chearful under opprobrium dauntless however menaced stedfast though the red right arm of power and persecution strike him a man determined in right unrevengeful of wrong and making his own happiness but incidental to the happiness of the whole such a man though he will seek justice for himself because it is a duty yet should it be denied him will bear injuries with fortitude and private misfortunes without a murmur Happy is it for him that he is capable of this equanimity But what is the guilt of that Government which can tear him from his benevolent pursuits endanger his existence and if it fail in the completion of its evil designs yet abbreviate and half cut off the powers  which he had been all his life toiling to attain only that he might employ them for the good of his fellow men his brothers among whom he numbers his very persecutors themselves  This was the address which I was prepared to have spoken and which act of exculpatory justice I strongly suspected as it happened would be denied me I was committed to Newgate on the th of October where I remained eight weeks within a day On Saturday November the th I received the following notice  The  KING  against  THOMAS HARDY  and others  I am directed by Mr Attorney General to inform you that it is his intention that you should be brought to the bar at the Old Bailey on Monday morning next and that a Jury should then be sworn for your trial but that he does not  propose to give evidence against you upon this indictment  Yours c JOSEPH WHITE Solicitor for the Crown  th Nov  To Thomas Holcroft one of the Defendants in the above indictment  Mr Solicitor White did not come himself to deliver this paper nor was the morning the time chosen for its delivery it was after the hour of locking up which is nine o'clock That is whether so contrived or not it was after the hour that I could either send to inform my friends or write to communicate the intelligence to the country and Sunday being no postday it was by this means concealed as long as possible I do not know that this had any meaning but such petty circumstances that look like art have so frequently come under my observation that if they were all  unintentional the coincidence at least has been remarkable  On Monday December Ist Mr Bonney Mr Kyd Mr Joyce and I were put to the bar and in the language of the court honourably acquitted The other gentlemen bowed and retired I attempted to speak and the attempt produced the following dialogue  Mr Holcroft  My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury  Chief Justice  Mr HolcroftYou have been acquitted in a way that hardly affords much room for your observationI think the best way would be for you to follow the example of the rest of the Gentlemen who have retired  Mr Holcroft  My LordEvery man must act according to the best of his own judgment My judgment tells me that it is my duty on the present occasion to address a few words to this court and the gentlemen of the jury  Chief Justice  You will understand one thing and that is that having been acquitted  you have  no right  to address one word either to the court or the juryAt the same time I don't wish to hold you strictly to that right but conduct yourself properly and I won't stop you  Mr Holcroft  My LordI have well considered what I have to say Whether my judgment and the judgment of your Lordship should happen to differ it is impossible for me to foreknow but what I have to say flows from the dictates I believe of an honest and well intentioned mind I am liable like all other men to mistake Let my mistakes be heard and examined  Chief Justice  Those dictates must be properly timedAt present you are not called upon to say any thing and you have no right to detain the court by a long speech  Mr Holcroft  I will not detain the court more than half an hour  Chief Juslice  Half an hourMr Holcroft you must withdraw  Mr Holcroft  After having suffered the injustice that I think I have suffered and  which injustice it is my desire to state here publicly to this court  Chief Juslice  Mr HolcroftYou have been dealt with  most honourably  on the part of the Attorney General You stood indicted by your Country and no man who happens so stand in that situation ought to complain of injustice because  he accuses his country of injustice  when he makes that complaint You have had no extraordinary hardships You brought yourself into custody by your own voluntary surrender You have had no extraordinary hardship since that time and you have in the close of it been treated most honourably and with all possible attention by the Attorney General who has consented to your being acquitted instead of standing at the Bar upon evidence which must have been left to the jury as evidence proper for their consideration upon the question whether you were to be found guilty or not guilty You have no right to complain of injustice and therefore  you ought not to be heard upon a complaint of injustice  Mr Holcroft  My Lord I desire but one word  Baron Hotham  Mr Kirby why don't you do your duty  Mr Holcroft  My Lord permit me to say one word  Chief Justice  If you will be reasonable and confine yourself within compass I will not stop you but a speech of half an hour is not a thing to be endured  Mr Holcroft  I find the judgment of the court wishes me to with drawI always desire to comport myself so as to gain best the good opinion of mankind by the exertion of what I think to be my duty If my judgment happens to be mistaken if I am wrong in this instance I am certainly sorry I have not more understanding I do not wish either to appear a violent man or an obstinate manI had something to say to this court which I think of the utmost importance to my country and mankind in  general and therefore I wished for a moment to be heard but as it does appear to be the opinion of this Court and every body here I must accede to that public opinion in this place and must take some other means of publishing my sentiments upon the prosecution that has been instituted against me  Chief Justice  You had better take care of that or you may get into  another scrape  as soon as you are relieved  from this  Mr Holcroft  My LordI am very willing to suffer for what I conceive to be right  The above dialogue is printed from notes taken in short hand by Mr Ramsey after it was over I with drew  Before I close my narrative I must state two particulars which I forgot to insert in their proper places The first is that I sent to my Counsel and Solicitor with the plan of the defence that I wished should be made for me the names of above sixty persons highly respectable of opposite parties and of no party whose testimony  would indubitably have proved the facts I had stated I could easily have doubled the number had I not been conscious that the counsel would probably not call half of those I had named  The other particular was that my Solicitor Mr Foulkes wrote in a manly manner to the Privy Council his desire that I might be allowed my amanuensis and that the demand was immediately complied with It was his extreme anxiety and sincere friendship that induced him to take this step but it was without my knowledge I commend his intention with a warm a glowing sense of its rectitude and had I been consulted as far as I recollect the letter I should have acquiesced in sending it with this single addition that the thing required was required as an act of justice for that it did not become me to ask or them to grant any thing that had not pure justice for its basis  And now I have little to add except a just acknowledgment to those many kind and faithful friends who from a conviction  of my innocence and the injury done me so chearfully and firmly came forward in my support And it was some proof of the general tenor of my conduct to see that those who had known me the longest were the foremost I make no efforts to express my deep sense of gratitude and obligation because I consider such expressions generally as hypocritical and always as erroneous Men have nothing but duties to perform Every action is either right or wrong If it be right the good that accrues to the whole is its true reward it promotes the present happiness of the parties and by the necessary perception of its good effects increases their future good But though I profess no gratitude I do not think I am less sensible of the kindness I have received than those who imagine gratitude to be the first of virtues While life and memory remain I never can forget the real virtues of these friends and I hope too I never shall forget to imitate them for which I think they will continue to have reason to esteem me much  more than if I were incessantly to have the words gratitude and obligation on my lips and indolence and selfishness in my heart Those virtues I will emulate and those virtues and the persons who possess them I most affectionately esteem  LETTER I  TO SIR JOHN SCOT  His Majesty's Attorney General  SIR  EACH individual man is the creature of the various circumstances under which he has existed and continues to exist His actions may be good or evil and being past are unalterable But to blame him who is a sensitive being and nothing more or less for being subject to sensation is to blame water because it is wet winter that it is cold summer that it is hot and men that they are ignorant of the best means of promoting their own happiness To search after happiness is the entire employment of their lives and to accuse them for pursuing  it in the manner which they imagine however mistakenly will best attain their end is an absurdity Yet this is an absurdity which few men on earth have clearly and definitely perceived and which it is probable all men without exception hourly commit It is seldom indeed that the man and the mistake are not identified though they ought everlastingly to be kept distinct for the mistake is past recal but the man may amend The error should never be spared the person ought never to be attacked When mistakes are pointed out the man who committed them ought to be happy at their discovery and to consider them with exactly the same sensations as he would have done had they been committed by another person All men ought to feel thus but I am well aware that at present no men do except on those rare occasions when they happen to recollect this principle and unfortunately this principle is known only to a few  If the doctrine I here state be true you and I sir have been compelled by the laws  of our existence to act as we have done and ought when called to the revisal of our actions to be desirous of perceiving the truth We should if possible discover their good or evil tendency in its full extent and in either case the emotion excited instead of painful ought always to be pleasant Error once committed cannot be recalled and sorrow is a fruitless and childish waste of our time and conduces to an habitual abuse of our faculties while joy at the discovery is rational because it is only in proportion as we accurately know what is the tendency of our actions in other words that which is good from that which is evil that we can exert ourselves to promote individual and general happiness  That you have been led to disapprove some of my actions I must take for granted by the prosecution which in the character of the Public Accuser you have lately instituted against me For I will not do your understanding that wrong to suppose you could have placed any man in the danger to which your accusation brought me merely  because you were commanded so to pursue me Yet of which of my actions you disapprove and whether of many or of few I own I am totally ignorant  It is this perplexing question added to the praise you have received for the honourable manner in which you have treated me that are the cause and the subject of my letter This praise too has been bestowed from that tribunal on which the law bear with me while I say the fabulous law presumes partiality cannot find place Not satisfied with this eulogium one of your coadjutors laboured with no little effort to extend the panegyric That you had acted honourably was not sufficient Mr Sergeant Adair informed the court  that you had acted with that candor and honour that respect to a court and jury of your country and that deference and regard to the  liberties  of your fellowsubjects which so peculiarly mark your character and have so honourably distinguished your conduct  This emphatical and ample tribute of  praise was yet insufficient he again returned to his eulogy which seemed to oppress his imagination "Gentlemen" said he  four of these persons have been this day acquitted I had almost said by the consent of His Majesty's Attorney General but more properly by his  for bearing  to consent to adduce any evidence against them  In this tone worthy as it seems to me of a French Academician declaiming on the virtues of a  Grand Monarque  he continued but I  forbear  further quotation having already cited all that is necessary for my purpose  There is surely a most embarrassing and injurious confusion in the common terms of language Honourable is the word on which these eulogists have most dwelt and most delighted in And what is honourable Is it something more or something less than right If sir this very honourable dealing were something more than right to me for example was it not something wrong to others that is to men in  general And can any man prove that to do wrong to men in general is to do right nay more than right to an individual What hypocrisy what falsehood is it that lurks under such commonplace expressions Do they mean any thing or do they mean nothing But honourable that is more than right is inadequate to the expression of your merits and forbearance or more than more than right is brought in as an auxiliary to strengthen the insufficient praise It is strange that the profession of a lawyer which in many instances seems to oblige the professor to study with uncommon attention the accurate meaning of terms and phrases should yet beget the perplexity and inexplicable contradictions which we so often find to be its offspring I own that in this instance it was the jargon of commonplace which Mr Serjeant Adair employed but surely by a man of his acknowledged acumen and superior talents it ought to have been detected In this honourable acquittal this forbearing to adduce  evidence you sir either did that which was right or that which was wrong My opinion is you did that which was wrong  Except the false accusation by which you brought me to the bar I consider this honourable dealing this forbearing to adduce evidence as the greatest injury you have done me I was acquitted What could I desire more This was the question which the eyes and gestures of the whole legal phalanx judges barristers and clerks seemed to ask when I had the insolence to desire to be heard I speak the language which their features spoke Had not the Law released me from its harpy talons and ought I not to have stolen away and be happy so to escape What My head on my shoulders and yet complain Well might the Lord Chief Justice exclaim "It was not to be endured" Yes sir surrounded as you were by the deathdealing expounders of Bracton Coke and the Statutes at large I would most gladly have encountered their united thunders would you but have suffered me after being publicly accused to  have been as publicly heard The thing I desired was that the world should know I had been accused totally without foundation that my prosecutors had absolutely no proof of my guilt and that I had proof irrefragable of my innocence This sir was what I wanted but this was what they did not want I must be silenced I must be menaced I must be insulted by the hands of a jailor at the nod of a judge after having suffered false imprisonment the loss of property and a most iniquitous attack on my physical and moral existence my life and utility  Sir I protest I speak with no personal enmity to them or you but I speak with a strong and deep sense of the moral turpitude of your mistakes No instead of exciting to vengeance I wish to warn the world in this and every instance not to confound the man with the errors of his understanding Had that been more correct his actions would have been less vicious He intends good and ought to be instructed not tortured not torn to pieces  not hanged drawn and quartered when he commits evil  Sir the very reason of my surrender was that I might be tried Had I feared the evidence you had to adduce that is had I really been guilty I should have thought it my duty to have done that which you gave me the opportunity of doing to have fled For though I can as little approve of my own guilt I mean my own mistakes when I know them to be such as I can of yours yet I would not have been wilfully accessary to more guilt that of the most pernicious of punishments death when I did not perceive how my death could have been beneficial to mankind Conversing with Mr Horne Tooke on the morning of our arraignment he told me that the best thing our profecutors could have done for the cause of freedom was that which they had done imprison and indict us except the still better thing which they had yet to do namely to hang us Though I widely differed with him concerning the best I like him was convinced that after this  wrong had been committed wise and virtuous men might develop its evil consequences and thus turn it to the benefit of the community But this sir could only be done by discussion by a faithful statement of facts from which lessons of future wisdom might be deduced and by a sagacious foresight of the result  If so my writing to you is an act of duty and though your office be that of accusation you will scarcely accuse me for having performed it In the course of the pamphlet of which this letter is a part I have stated some of the public and some of the private injuries that have been committed in my case and in these I consider you as a principal participator but I tax your mistakes not your person and though I have been imprisoned defamed put in danger of my life and refused a trial nay a hearing of half an hour as a thing intolerable to men seated on the tribunal of justice I neither speak in anger seek revenge nor wish you harm If honourable as here applied to you have a good meaning  I deny your honourable dealing If it have a bad one you will scarcely deem it worthy your acceptance and if it have none perhaps the persons who employed it will have less of a selfish motive for blushing than if it had expressed all that they intended  In fine sir the essential question concerning which the general safety is interested that which many have asked and more will ask is Why did you include my name in the indictment I say mine in particular because though the question may well be put for all the persons indicted yet I stood so peculiarly aloof from suspicion as to make your proceeding dangerously incomprehensible By what arguments is it uncharitable to say by what arts did your agents so confound and mislead the grand jury as to induce them to return a true bill Sir there are many who put such interrogations with a rational anxiety for their own safety I was a member of the Constitutional Society is that your only answer There were many members of that society  for I do not know the number why did you not indict them all Is there a man in England who is a more enthusiastic friend to a system of peace and a more ardent opposer of violence than I am But I was a member of the Committee of Conference Why were not all the members indicted I appeared at it but once and you had evidence that I then  talked a great deal about peace of my being against any violent or coercive means that were usually resorted to against our fellowcreatures that I urged the more powerful operations of philosophy and reason to convince man of his errors nay zealot as you no doubt will deem me that man might disarm his greatest enemy by those means and oppose his fury because truth is all powerful that I gave advice to the above effect to the delegates present who all seemed to agree as no person opposed my arguments and that this conversation lasted better than an hour  What sir In a system which you pretend was to overturn the government and  depose and kill the king was a man who being with the imaginary conspirators whom on the face of facts he certainly did not suppose to be conspirators was this urgent preacher of peace this enthusiastic apostle of nonresistence a fit man to be selected by way of preference The error appears to be so gross that it is scarcely hyperbolical to ask whether the person who committed it was not at that moment a lunatic You might dislike my principles and I could be glad that one of us were better informed you might think my peaceful exhortations dangerous that I can easily conceive but how could you so impose upon your understanding as to imagine them treasonable What The man that meeting these supposed conspirators argues by the hour for order and peace in all their proceedings does he excite to insurrection is he too a conspirator How does it appear Produce your proofs sir and rescue your understanding  Yes I know you must have been deceived though with the utmost sincerity  of heart I protest I cannot conceive how except by that dereliction of mind which if not insanity I know not by what name it can properly be called However sir that I may deal with the strictest impartiality I will state the only circumstance that has come to my knowledge of the proof you intended to bring against me  After the persons apprehended had been all of them examined and some I believe committed to the Tower while Mr Sharp whose testimony I have quoted as given before the Privy Council was in the custody of an officer though suffered to remain in his own house I and a friend paid him a visit the officer being present Believing as it has proved that there were not private proceedings or treasonable conspiracies existing and therefore that government must have by some means been unaccountably misled I conjectured that this might have happened from the falsehoods which the passions and the selfish views of their inferior agents had engendered To guard against these miscoceptions and  falsehoods was at this moment a very serious duty Our visit was to Mr Sharp but the officer thought proper to mingle in the conversation and though he was not a King's messenger but of a lower and more illiterate order I do not think the remarks of such men ought to be treated with disdian In answer therefore to some of these remarks I said a few words intimating that violence was always a vice by whomsoever committed This he seemed to feel as an attack upon his profession and conceiving me to be a dangerous person a Jacobin no doubt affirmed that he had seen me at the meetings or a meeting of the Corresponding Society I immediately denied it and he again asserted he had seen me there The man who could imagine and persist in one falsehood might imagine and persist in another This instantly made me recollect my former reflections and brought to my view the mischiefs in which the mistakes of a number of such men might involve the nation I did not act from blind passion I intended to make  a strong impression upon him and in a firm but undisturbed tone of voice said to him "Sir you are a liar" Again he repeated the affirmative and I with increasing firmness replied"It is a  wicked  lie sir"  Mr Sharp's letter says  impudent  A word may easily be changed I think myself certain from the spirit in which I spoke and the effect I wished to produce that the epithet was wicked though that is of little moment  This was construed into a design on my part to affront the officer produce violence and favour the escape of Mr Sharp An ignorant man might easily so misconstrue but would an ignorant man forget that he was guilty of the evasion of saying that if he had not seen me at the meetings of the Corresponding Society he had seen me at Mr Thelwall's Lectures and that I immediately replied I had been present once and never but once at a lecture delivered by Mr Thelwall Did he forget too that there was another person whose name I do not  know in the room and that this person left the room before the departure of my friend and myself that if such had been our design we were then more at liberty since the person by going proved he was not in this alarming conspiracy yet that after sitting some little time and I conversing with my former coolness the moment the man was silenced on this subject we left him without any signs ofiresentment or opposition  But sir supposing my mode of producing the effect I desired as vicious and as unworthy as you please and I suspected even at the time that it had vice in it though I knew not how taken so suddenly to act otherwise yet was telling this man or any man who had really uttered a dangerous lie that he was a liar treason A treble guard was immediately put upon Mr Sharp which is proof indeed that the man had so told his story as to produce alarm in the Privy Council whose system it was to alarm and be alarmed But what had this man's being pronounced a liar in common with treason This was several months  too before the presenting the bill of indictment No second attempt had been made for the escape of Mr Sharp and if we had wished his flight could you sir think conspirators and deep designers as we were that we should have planned and executed our plot with such contemptible inefficacy You might believe us to be wicked and weak but surely you could not suppose we were idiots Why was I not examined too before the Privy Council for this as well as for the rest of my conspiracies What possible answer can be given to that question Surely you would not designedly avoid the encounter of a man of such shallow intellect as such a failure would indicate  Sir the substance of this address is that I have been accused by you of high treason that the accusation was a flagrant breach of justice for you had no proof whatever against me but essential evidence in my favour that by the management of the prosecutors of whom you are officially at the head the indictment was returned a true  bill that I have suffered all the evils of imprisonment family alarm wasting of substance and loss of time that in addition to these you inflicted a wrong greater than them all you refused to let me be heard in my own defence by refusing to bring me to trial that you did this to avoid the disgrace of having indicted a man for the enormous crime of High Treason contrary to evidence and that you sat and by your silence acquiesced in the praise that was bestowed upon you for the last and greatest of these acts of injustice The conclusion I am obliged to draw sir is a very obvious one You hold an office which while you exercise since you can be guilty of errors so dangerous as these the life of no man in the kingdom is safe Be just to yourself and your fellow subjects acknowledge that you do not possess that cool unprejudiced impartiality which this office requires do the right which is yet in your power relieve the nation of its fears and abandon a station for which all dispassionate men will affirm you are unsit  THOMAS HOLCROFT  LETTER II  To Lord Chief Justice Eyre  My Lord  Hearing as I take it for granted you will hear through some channel of my present address to your Lordship I have reason to suppose by the warning you gave me when I expressed my intention in the open court of publishing my thoughts that you will not expect me to be temperate I know not why you should have formed such an opinion you certainly as I believe had no proof on which it might be built On the two occasions of my surrender and my acquittal I am utterly ignorant of my own emotions if I were not determinedly cool and collected I suspect your lordship had not developed your own motives and that they were a latent consciousness that I had what is generally supposed to be very great cause of complaint The manner in which I was prevented from speaking whether intentionally or  not had every appearance of the prosecutors being fearful that I should speak disagreeable truths I have published the address I had prepared and you they and the world may now decide  This is but the preface to the subject of my present letter which I mean to be a few necessary remarks and arguments on the propositions delivered by your lordship when I appeared before you And here I must entreat your serious attention to a distinction which I think ought to be made Truth contemplates man as the creature of the circumstances under which he exists and did those circumstances vary he would then inevitably be different In other words I consider your lordship as conviction obliges me to consider all human beings that is as a man who acts from knowledge when you promote the general good and when you do the reverse from ignorance I attribute no malice to you but some mistakes and those mistakes are rendered dangerous by the talents  you possess and the station you fill I admir your faculties because they are comprehensive I censure your errors because they are baneful I know that if I had the power to convince you that they are errors you would commit them no more and if I want that power who or what am I to accuse except the mutual want of the means of making ourselves intelligible that is our mutual ignorance Let us both therefore sincerely and cordially exert ourselves to forget persons and inquire into facts  The heads of the inquiries I wish to be made taken in the order in which they occurred when I appeared before you are these  What is indulgence  What is right  May not a man's country that is the government its officers and a grand jury commit injustice  Was the act of surrendering myself the part of a good citizen and an honest man  Was it to warn or to intimidate that you advised me to take care of publishing my sentiments on my own case  There is another question namely the honourable dealing of the Attorney General which I shall omit to discuss with your lordship because I have already addressed myself to that gentleman  To begin with the first your lordship will no doubt recollect that when I asked for the attendance of my amanuensis you answered that unless my health made it requisite it would be contrary to custom and an indulgence which you could not grant My lord contrary to custom is one thing indulgence is another The forms of courts may be regulated by custom and to those whether just or unjust having accepted the high office you hold you may think proper to conform But what does indulgence mean That too must either be just or unjust If it mean a just action surely a just action is no indulgence If it mean an unjust action it scarcely can be characterized by a word  which if it have any precise meaning seems to incline to the side of benevolence It is no fault of mine my lord that the world has long been amusing itself with words instead of truth When you mentioned health had not a severe adherence to veracity restrained me I might have profited by the hint I did not forget that I had a disease with which I had been afflicted between two and three years but it was not of a nature to make the attendance of a servant necessary That was not my motive for asking the aid of another hand To have pleaded such a motive though the lax morality of the world would have construed it into truth would have been falsehood and very unworthy of a man acting upon the principles which brought me to surrender myself in that court I then wished to act truly and I now wish to excite your lordship and all mankind to the examination of truth I think therefore you will easily discover there can be no such things as indulgence and that it is a word which ought even to be banished the  nursery and is highly unworthy of a court of justice Either it was right that I should have the aid I required to enable me to demonstrate my innocence or it was wrong That is it was right or wrong to deny me the means of justification as indeed imprisonment and all other constraint more or less do deny But of this your lordship and the world in general have hitherto been but little aware nor is it probable that I should have the power of awakening you  The last time I was brought before your lordship you informed me that "having been acquitted I had no right to address one word either to the court or the jury" The same question again occurs I suppose your lordship meant I had no right according to the custom of the court That however I believe is a fact not well established But I consider all rules that have nothing better than custom for their basis as founded in error I shall therefore only ask was it just or unjust that I having been published a traitor to the whole nation should employ every means  in my power to prove to the nation how entirely innocent I had been of the crime laid to my charge If right signify just is it not right that every man should be as useful in society as possible And does the suspected man enjoy his full extent of utility Did this dumb acquittal leave me wholly unsuspected I can solemnly assure your lordship it did not Since my release from prison I daily meet men who used to approach me with smiles and friendship who now avert their eyes and either from dislike or timidity shun my acquaintance I state a fact not a complaint I asked only half an hour and was answered with an exclamation that a speech of half an hour was a thing not to be endured What then were the speeches of the counsel for the crown when accusation when acrimony when punishment were the pursuit Speeches of seven eight and nine hours were endurable Readings repetitions litigious quibbles and the testimonies of spies which protracted a sentence on which probably the lives of thousands and hundreds of thousands depended to  the enormous length of eight days beginning early in the morning and frequently ending after midnight these were endurable And if justice could be forwarded by such inquiries so they ought to be but of that I vehemently doubt Could I have spoken for eight days and by speaking have conduced to the promoting of justice I ought to have been patiently and attentively heard I will say more though in none of these things I expect to be joined by your lordship which is that had my speech of half an hour been wholly wrong it ought to have been heard and for this plain reason that my errors by being known might have some chance of being corrected  But there are other and more obvious motives which imperiously called on me to speak and on my country to hear I had been rendered a suspected man to the nation A bill for high treason had been presented against me and had been found in the language of your lordship by my country On this indictment your lordship had committed me to prison I had  been brought to the bar and arraigned and every means except the last had been taken by the law which could induce my countrymen to believe I was the traitor the indictment asserted me to be My lord after proceedings so awful as these to forbid an innocent man to counteract their dangerous consequences by informing mankind of truths relative to his own conduct of which they were ignorant and a knowledge of which would restore him to their good opinion is one of those violent acts of injustice against which it is the duty of every man to protest  I was told by your lordship that I stood indicted by my country and that no man who happens to stand in that situation ought to complain of injustice because he accuses his country of injustice when he makes that complaint"I own to your lordship that I have seldom heard a proposition more extraordinary It may be the language of the law but surely common sense revolts at it What is it impossible for my country to be mistaken And of what does this country consist Of threeandtwenty  men nominated by the officers of the Crown composing what is called a grand jury instructed by the crown I speak of this case hearing none but the witnesses for the crown and deciding by a majority Will it be affirmed that it was impossible for these men to be guilty of error And is not all error unjust Was there never an innocent man hanged And was his country which put him to death guilty of no injustice I think I can demonstrate that all wars are unjust but no man will affirm that offensive and predatory wars are not so And were there never offensive and predatory wars Has this country never undertaken such wars Or is this country exclusively exempt from error I have heard national prejudices too frequently repeated but I never heard an assertion so violent as this except from the mouth of lawyers uttering the sictions of law Ignorant as I am of these fictions till this period I was ignorant that this was one of them I had heard that the king could do no wrong but never before knew that his subjects were equally infallible I affirm that wrong has  been committed on me and if my country had no concern in it I must conclude that the ministers of this country the attorney general the grand jury and the other persons concerned were no part of my country a conclusion which in the present self+admiring temper of Englishmen would probably not be very grateful to them  Perhaps I have too great an aptitude to feel surprise If so I am willing my mistakes should be known for I confess I again felt extreme surprise when I heard myself reproached by your lordship for surrendering myself after a bill had been found against me for high treason What my lord Being conscious of my own innocence would you have advised me to the clandestine act of concealment of flight of inducing the world to believe me guilty Surely in this instance your lordship's memory slept you had forgotten even your own law which admits the appearance or slight of the prisoner as presumptive proof of innocence or guilt Nay do you not instruct the jury to inquire among the first of their proceedings whether the person accused  "fled for it" But leaving law and recurring to a more accurate standard to justice is that man just to himself or to the community who by his cowardice renders himself suspected and robs himself and his country of as much utility as this suspicion destroys Would your lordship bid innocence live under the stigma of guilt Would you condescend so to live I will not think so meanly of you Greatly mistaken as I conceive you have been in many parts of the late legal proceedings I have a much higher opinion of your understanding It would not suffer you to practise a precept so injurious and so unmanly When I came to surrender myself you informed me you would not take advantage of my indiscretion I will not doubt but that you felt kindly and meant me well but were you not deceived How was I indiscreet Was there no intention to apprehend after having indicted me Ministry instituted the prosecution could I suppose that the only end they had in view was to stigmatize and render me suspected Or if I had entertained that belief ought I  to have submitted to the injurious falsehood and walk at large a proclaimed traitor No that ministry certainly would not have endured as little perhaps as I could endure the ignominy of concealment Well then ought I to have subjected myself to have been guarded through the streets a prisoner and brought like a culprit into the presence of the blindly accusing law when I could so far walk a free man to deliver myself up to my prosecutors Who will affirm that either of these would have been the act of a wise and virtuous man conscious of his owninnocence  When I informed the court being denied the liberty of speaking that I must take some other means of publishing my sentiments concerning the prosecution that had been instituted against me this was your lordship's answer"You had better take care of that sir or you may get into another scrape as soon as you are relieved from this"I replied that I was very willing to suffer for what I conceived to be right and your lordship turned back on the bench with an interjection expressing strong disapprobation Again I am at issue with  your lordship I know but one standard for all the actions of men and the question will eternally recur is the action right or wrong just or unjust Was it my duty to publish facts which I suppose may aid men in their future conduct or was it not Imagine me to be at present under the influence of passion or any other error yet is it not healthful to myslf and to society that I should make my errors known lest by being treasured up in my mind they should corrode till they burst forth with tenfold virulence How are mistakes to be corrected while they remain undiscovered If I utter falsehood of any kind has government no person in pay who can tell truth Is it falsehood or is it fact that government is unwilling to hear Why was it desirable that no further inquiry should take place after the prisoners who had escaped a cruel and barbarous death should be released Are proceedings so serious to all men immediately to be hushed and smothered in silence as soon as the prosecutors shall have failed in attempts which were either just or unjust If just why should they shun inquiry  If unjust will your lordship affirm that injustice ought not to be made public Our king and our country it seems can do no wrong Are ministry equally impeccable Is there any law fiction to protect them I do not mean their persons but their actions their mistakes if it be possible that they ever did or ever can commit any  "I had better take care or I may get into another scrape" I will not carp at a word which though vulgar was expressive but will ask your lordship by what action of mine it was that I got into a scrape How am I to avoid getting into another By what secret is any man to avoid false accusation Is your lordship wise enough to know If you are for charity's sake make it public reformers have been and are in perilous need of it  Surely the better judgment of your lordship had forsaken you during this whole dialogue I do not seek to injure you in the opinion of your countrymen if I did the accusation of so unprotected a person you would probably disregard I have declared my sentiments concerning your talents and  your mistakes I am equally sincere in both though I have but lightly touched on either for this letter is but a trifle to what I could write on the proceedings in which you have been involved in the course of this prosecution But they are foreign to my present subject and if they were not I would endeavour as I now do to convince your lordship that I have and could have no motive but the desire not of doing injury to an individual but good to all I give my thoughts for what they are worth let those examine them who think they deserve to be examined It may well be doubted whether I can suggest any new truth but I think it possible that I should place old ones now and then in a clear point of view That you should feel offended to hear a man declare himself willing to suffer for doing that which he believed to be right that is for discharging what he supposed to be a duty was a thing which if I had not seen and heard I scarcely should have credited You might believe though I know not why you should that I should certainly  do wrong yet in your cooler moments you could not I think but applaud the intention and I conclude with repeating my persuasion that your judgment was less sound on this occasion than it generally is in occurrences perhaps less serious in their consequences  THOMAS HOLCROFT  LETTER III  To Mr Serjeant Adair  Sir  IN my letter to the Attorney General I have quoted some sentiments which you delivered in your opening against Mr Thelwall and which I think it behoves me to notice I have there made some remarks on them and here intend to add a few more but must previously repeat the substance of what you will find I have said in my prefatory addresses to Mr Attorney General and Lord Chief Justice Eyre that the motive of my writing is not to give you pain but by detecting your mistakes to add as I  hope to the means of general improvement Perhaps you may think the supposition that I have the power to give pain undignified and unprotected by the great as I am is a trait of arrogance I believe however this to be a mistake beneath your understanding You have been too long familiar with an elevated situation to imagine that any thing but the efforts of sound reason can shield a man from the pain of accusation whether it be false or true But sir though I conceive you will be more dispassionate there are persons who are so devoured with zeal against Jacobins among whom were there no other circumstances this prosecution has in their opinion ranked me that arrogant will be too soft a term to express their sensations  This is a matter of trifling moment My present theme is the forbearing benevolence of His Majesty's Attorney General Will you patiently permit me to tell you sir how forbearing that gentleman has been He forbore to call evidence against me which according to the phrase was very honourable in him indeed for he had none to call  He forbore to keep me and my fellow sufferers longer in prison because he was conscious that the minds of men revolted at the injustice of the punishment we had already endured He forbore to exasperate the public more by the disclosure of the extreme folly of which in the fervor of his accusing zeal he had been guilty in charging a man with the crime of High Treason at the moment when he had depositions to prove the man so charged to be the enthusiastic preacher of peace and the determined opponent of violence I have called it folly by what word would you have characterized such conduct Yes sir he forbore to prosecute in proportion as he perceived he wanted the power He forbore to inflict evil the moment he discovered how dangerous his conduct was become I would not be understood to say or suppose that he thought it evil but did his mistakes lessen the injury His forbearance has indeed been exemplary and I fear he will still continue to forbear He will probably forbear in all companies into which he goes to inform them that he has  accused without proof has acquitted with reluctance and has passed through Temple Bar with a confused mind if not with an aching heart He forbore to visit and console the families of the prisoners by whose industry till manacled by him these families had been supported and he will still forbear to inquire whether the sires of those prisoners be starving their children naked or their wives living or dead Let him if he be not unexpectedly wise or deplorably erroneous such forbearance will conduce to the quiet of his conscience  I have but one question more to ask and that sir relates wholly to yourself You are a man who have as I may say been trammeled in the manners and customs of courts of law You have sat upon the bench and been led to consider the duties and even delicacies of such a situation You are not ignorant that every expiation which kind and respectful treatment can publicly afford is due to a man who has been acquitted by his country for this acquittal avows the accusation to have been false Where  sir was the kindness where the respect where the decency of telling a man who had just been acquitted by his country that the reason of his acquittal was the forbearing to introduce witnesses Sir I intend no personal offence when I say it was so far from kind respectful or decent that it was absolutely false You forgot yourselt Men are subject to mistakes and all that I here intend is to vindicate and do justice to my own character against an error which I hope you would not frequently be so forgetful of what is due to justice and to a person falsely accused as to commit  THOMAS HOLCROFT  LETTER IV  To the Honourable Thomas Erskine and Vicary Gibbs Esquire  Gentlemen  HAD I not been personally implicated in the late strange prosecutions for High Treason  I still must have contemplated I hope with no less interest the men whose talents and integrity had fitted them to be the defenders of the human race A sense of duty has obliged me to remark on the mistakes of some persons concenred in these trials and the duty of stating the facts which display truths of a contrary nature cannot be thought less urgent I have no personal intimacy with either of you and I certainly differ widely with you both concerning the principle of coercion on which law is founded On this ground I have sometimes necessarily disapproved even parts of the astonishing defence you made in favour of the prosecuted I think therefore I shall not rationally be suspected of an endeavour to bestow unmerited eulogium on you Beside as I have already said my chief praise will be a recapitulation of facts  When I recollect these facts I consess the accumulated mass excites in me no small degree of amazement Braving the cabals of a violent numerous and powerful party whom none but men of fortitude would  have dared to brave you began labours which like the ascent of the Alps as you proceeded shewed that having climbed mountains you had mountains still to climb The notice you had was abrupt the cases each a vast chaos of darkness and the issue perhaps in the opinion of both parties little less than an age of happiness or of misery to mankind The indictment unjust as it surely was by its complicated nature contained the names of twelve men to whose individual narratives you were bound to listen and not only to exert all your faculties to deduce the unmixed truth from them but to divine how you might confute and annihilate accusing falshood You had two lists of upward of four hundred persons jurymen and witnesses to scrutinize and by this enormous catalogue the lives of your clients and the liberties of the nation were to be decided The character of every man whose name it contained was to be sifted The prejudices of jurymen as they might be conjectured to arise from the nature of their employments  declarations and dependencies demanded severe inquiry and the characters connections and vices of some of the witnesses an inquiry perhaps still more painful more disgusting more severe Failure in either of these essential points might have been destruction to the great cause you had risen to defend  The nature of the accusation was still more confounding It was a mass of heterogeneous facts vague but perplexing assertions and tedious and stupefying readings and recapitulations It is now proved that there was nothing treasonable in them but their artful and benumbing effects you had to destroy or freedom had to fall  To you Mr Erskine truth requires I should particularly address myself and the distinction I know will give no small pleasure to your kind and dignified fellowlabourer I saw the tears start in his eyes I heard the tremulous sinking of his voice I witnessed the affections working in his bosom when he attempted in his eloquent and animated speech in the defence of Mr  Thelwall to express his deep sense of your virtue It was a marking trait in his character which those who know how to estimate it will not forget  He then will most cordially join with me when I affirm that the intrepidity with which you encountered an embattled host of Crown lawyers whose angry brows were dark as Erebus whenever the Bench above them decided that the practice of the courts was in your favour was such as I believe no pleader in the kingdom could have equalled that the acumen with which you examined witnesses Spies I mean and Informers extracting truth from the black recesses of audacious falshood wresting it forth and dragging it to light was no less admirable that the discrimination with which you detected and exposed even without wounding the prevarications not of hired russians but of infatuated and prejudiced men drew applause even from your adversaries and that by your knowledge of the human heart you so managed the witnesses for the Crown as to make these  very witnesses prove the injustice and the falshood of the charges brought against your clients Various are the traits in the course of the trials that mark how eminently you possess the qualities I have attempted to describe One of these I cannot forbear to cite A friend who heard it and who is well studied in the human heart particularly in its great emotions speaking of it with transport has declared that accompanied by your voice look and gesture it was sublime While examining the spy Alexander who had not you detected him might have sworn away the life of Hardy observing his downcast countenance and suddenly interrupting yourself you exclaimed  Look at the Jury sir Don't look at me I have seen enough of you  The exertions of your genius thus far were delightful and had they ended here would I trust have saved the nation But here they were not to end Your speech in favour of Hardy at the close of the evidence for the Crown was such that  every creature who witnessed it young and old never mention it in my hearing but with rapture Accompanied as it was by that profound sense of the magnitude of the cause you had to defend and by that almost superhuman energy for such it is described to have been with which its momentous consequences inspired you the words you uttered were engraven on the hearts of your hearers Their affections were expanded and they glowed with that divine enthusiasm in the behalf of justice which strength of feeling and genius like yours only could infuse Sir you saved a nation and a nation's tears a nation's blessings a nation's love will follow you to the grave and there rest in everlastingly fond remembrance over your ashes  Nor must I forget that you sir were the man whose acuteness and genius fitted you for the momentous office and whose courage alone could resist obstacles that terrified minds less firm and propensities more selfish Sorry am I to learn that the bar is infested by a mercenary band who will not  whisper a word in favour of that freedom which those who have silk gowns and furred robes to bestow systematically discountenance They shun the unprofitable contest They afsirm and deny and cringe and cower and blow hot and blow cold as a nod from the powers that be shall indicate obedient and tame for a time that their turn to tyrannize may come Twelve innocent men might have perished nay a Nation have perished with them ere one man of any standing or command at the bar would have moved in their defence you sir was the only exception Your patriotism alone was pure enough to disregard personal views and momentary advantage You toiled for a nobler purpose than to render your children the future satraps of despotism Lighted by the torch of Liberty you saw the worshippers of Mammon forging their own shackles With a mind too elastic too independent too comprehensive to stoop thus basely the sight inspired you with increasing fortitude and you met the select legion of all the Inns and Halls marshalled  against you in dreadful array They advanced upon you glorying in their numbers now man by man and now exasperated at repulse rushing forward in a body You faced and fought them all with valour unequalled you fought and conquered  Shall I forget the man who so courageously imitated your daring less inured to the field yet eager to share your dangers If I do may my right hand forget her cunning He participated your toils he was your brother in anxiety and zeal and in logical deduction and close reasoning surely not your inferior If he did not imperiously reign over the sensations he commanded the assent of the understanding He like you had to repel the poisoned arrows of law and of law itself you mutually made a shield by which its terrors were averted  What shall I say How shall I address you Possessed of a people's love a people snatched by your aid and the fortitude of a few from the brink of slavery how shall an individual express his sense of your virtues and your worth Gentlemen the  triumph you gained and the applause bestowed upon you was heartfelt and little less than universal But it was not momentary No Ages to come shall resound with its acclamations They will be heard everlastingly at least while the actions of men as they are shall continue to interest men as they must be  THOMAS HOLCROFT  APPENDIX  I  AFTER the examination of the supposed conspirators before the Privy Council I was informed that some of them had been questioned concerning me and that their testimony had been the truth One of these I knew was Mr Sharp and being convinced when the trial of Mr Horne Tooke was over it was then impossible for Constructive Treason to make any farther attempts upon me and foreseeing that I should be called up to be acquitted without trial I wished to deliver the address which is inserted in this narrative That it might produce its full effect I was desirous of procuring the most authentic documents This occasioned me to write the following note  Mr Holcroft presents his compliments to Mr SharpThere is a rumour that he and others are to be called up and acquitted on Monday requests him 'therefore or rather conjures him as he loves the cause of freedom to furnish him with a correct statement of the evidence he gave immediately and if possible by the bearer If Mr Sharp know any other person who gave evidence before the Privy Council  concerning Mr Holcroft he will be greatly obliged if he will inform him  Newgate  Nov th  To this the answer subjoined was returned which having quoted in part it is necessary I should insert intire  Copy from my testimony which I signed at the Privy Council  The Society for Constitutional Information adjourned and left the Delegates in the room the most gentlemanlike person of the Corresponding Society took the chair and talked about an equal representation of the people and putting an end to war Holcroft talked about the powers of the human mind  This is the whole that I signed The particulars I remember of that conversation are I believe nearly as follow Mr Holcroft talked a great deal about peace of his being against any violent or coercive means that were usually resorted to against our fellowcreatures urged the more powerful operation of philosophy and reason to convince man of his errors and said that he would disarm his greatest enemy by those means and oppose his furySpoke also about truth being powerful c c and gave advice to the above effect to the Delegates present who all seemed to agree as no person present opposed his arguments This conversation lasted better than an hour and we departed The next time the Delegates met Holcroft was not present This is the substance of what I remember of that conversation  Before the Grand Jury I mentioned Mr Holcroft's disposition and conversation when we met about reasoning men out of their errors He was a sort of natural quaker and was for the peaceable means that philosophy and reason pointed out to convince mankind He was against violence of all kinds but did not believe in the secret impulses of the Spirit like the Quakers  I think it necessary to acquaint my friend Holcroft that notice will be taken to oppose my testimony of the words that passed at my house when I was in custody between the officer and Holcroftof his telling the man he was a liar it was an impudent lie which occasioned I understand two men being placed over me the next day they conceiving it a design on our part to affront the man to produce violence and favour my escape This I believe will be urged by the Counsel for the Crown to destroy my evidence in Holcroft's favour Holcroft must procure other persons who have heard him reprobate war and violence and oppose truth reason and philosophy I believe Tooke Godwin and Adams must remember conversations to that effect  W SHARP  The answer to the last paragraph may be seen in my letter to the Attorney General I shall only add that I very sincerely disapprove the word liar or any other word which has an aggravating tendency and that if the occasion on which I used that word did not justify the action I wish it to meet all the censure it deserves I have conscientiously related the motive with which it was used by me  II  THE following curious documents were communicated to me by a gentleman whose accuracy and perspicuity in seating facts have been eminently beneficial to the cause of reform and to whom the Nation is highly indebted for the very essential part he took in drawing up the state of the representation of England and Wales which was published by the Society of the Friends of the People In the following Defence I have endeavoured to give a sketch of the corruptions of parliament and have offered some conjectures on the oligarchical organization which if not prevented is likely to result The aunexed documents contain enumerations pointedly in favour of my whole argument The power of the Crown can only counteract the influence of the Peerage by swelling its list The Commons is proved to be the creature of their own creating By weakening each other they must fall and from their downfall a new order of things must in some form or other arise should the present pertinacious resistance to innovation that is to a change for the better be continued    AT the King's accession the total number of the Peerage exclusive of Princes of the Blood Bishops and Scotch Peers was    At the present day it is    Increase being above a fourth part of the whole      From the year to the year the total number of  new  Peers  created  exclusive of Princes Peeresses and Lords called up by summons was    From the year to the year the total number of  new  Peers created subject to the same exceptions as above was    His present Majesty therefore has created as many Peers in thirtyfour years as his three predecessors did in a period of almost twice the length    The total number of Peers created since the year is    Of which number there have been created since no less than    In other words in about a  ninth  part of the time Mr Pitt has created a  fourth  part of the number or comparing the number created by Mr Pitt with the total created in the present reign it appears that he has induced his Majesty to create more in  eleven  years than his predecessors in office could induce him to create in  twentythree    With respect to the election influence possessed by the House of Lords it appears by the Report of the Friends of the People to be as follows  N B This Report having been published nearly three years without being prosecuted answered or even contradicted and the substance of it standing upon the Journals of the House of Commons may now be fairly quoted as authentic in point of  facts  Seventyeight  Peers return members to serve in Parliament    Of which number the Peers created in the present reign return    The progress of this encroachment will appear more alarming when it is stated that The Peers created during eleven years ending in return to Parliament    The Peers created during eleven years ending in return to Parliament    The Peers created during eleven years ending in return to Parliament    N B This is exclusive of the members returned by Scotch Peers who have been created English Peers I apprehend the number to be at least but I never could get a return of the Patronage in Scotland The late creation of Peers and their patronage is included in the above taken from what in the Report of the Friends of the People is called the Patronage of Commoners    The total number of the present House of Lords after deducting Minors and Catholics who have no votes is    Of this number Have been put into the House of Lords by his present Majesty in the constitutional and necessary exercise of his prerogative Archbishops Bishops    Princes of the Blood made Peers by the King according to long established custom    Hereditary English Peers who belong to his Majesty's household    Hereditary English Peers who belong to the Prince of Wales's household    Hereditary English Peers who belong to her Majesty's household    Hereditary English Peers who hold great offices during pleasure under the King    Elected  by the Scotch Peers the majority of whom are notoriously under influence    Have been put into the House of Lords by the King and are not included in the above      Therefore of the present House of Lords do not fall under the description of  hereditary  and  independent  It appears from the above that the  hereditary  Peers not holding places amount only to    Leaving those  named by the King deputed by the Scotch Peers  or  influenced by the Crown  in a majority of    N B In the preceding table the sons of Peers created by his present Majesty are considered as Hereditary  Noblemen With respect to the number of hereditary Peers holding places or enjoying pensions I have no doubt that it might be very considerably increased but as to shew any majority was sufficient for my purpose I have not been anxious about it  DEFENCE  THE Crime of which I here stand accused I consider as one of the highest which man can commit It is the crime of meditating and conspiring to have recourse to arms and violence a crime that has the greatest tendency to inflame multitudes deprive them of reason and excite them to all the horrors of war which is a state the most destructive and the most unnatural to man I trust the Court and the Jury therefore will afford me a patient and an attentive hearing while I endeavour to shew the extreme injustice that has been done me that I may be restored to society without being deprived of any part of that utility which so intimately depends on a character unimpeachable  and a mind actuated by virtuous intention  Points of Law have already been most ably argued and if they had not my studies have not qualisied me to treat of Law in the detail It is voluminous complex and contradictory Either I mistake or it is the very opposite to the simple uniformity of Justice And here it is my duty to remind you Gentlemen of the Jury that the very essence of your office is to consider the Justice I say the Justice of this and of every case that comes before you and whenever Law is contrary to Justice studiously to preserve your minds untainted by its perplexities and unbiased by its dogmas I have much to say but remembering that not only my life but the lives of all future men to whom this case shall be brought as a precedent are at stake I am persuaded you will not think the duty of listening to my exculpation too severe Arraigned thus solemnly my defence against a charge of so deep a dye must be no less solemn  It is the nature of accusation to alarm all  society and render the individual accused universally suspected The benevolence he used to meet is fled from every face he is avoided the sweets of social intercourse are denied his functions are suspended his utility is cut off and his moral existence the power of doing good is always palsied and often destroyed  The effects of accusation at this moment are tenfold pernicious The present crisis has produced a degree of acrimony between contending parties that is pregnant with mischief acrimony unexampled perhaps since the proscribing days of Sylla and Caesar How is this desolating spirit to be appeased Can it be by accusation rashly made obstinately continued and I will not say prosecuted with malignity but I must say prosecuted by all the methods which men have beeen accustomed to ascribe to that odious principle What is it at this fearful moment that prompts and precipitates men to violence Violence that perhaps may blind them to an approaching mass of misery and rendering them furious  may plunge them in that frantic and pellmell destruction which we all deprecate all dread and all abhor It is this fatal spirit of acrimony a spirit which rashness engendered passion has envenomed and mutual obstinacy renders mutually atrocious  Gentlemen these are tremendous times This is a tremendous occasion And an unjust sentence will be followed by tremendous consequences Not on account of personal worth for individuals taken separately are but insects on each of which Power might set its foot and declare them noxious from the want of leisure and inclination to study their use No it is because such unjust decisions tend to increase that unrelenting animosity that savage hatred which already rages in the public mind  For my own part Gentlemen I will not merely contend that I am innocent but that I have aimed at being highly virtuous For this purpose I have two principal points to prove  That I was actuated by peaceful motives was the enemy of force and consequently  did not compass or imagine the death of the King or of any human being This will prove me guiltless of the black charge brought against me  That it is the duty of every man who perceives the mischiefs resulting from the present state of representation to endeavour to effect a reform and you all know Gentlemen that a conscientious discharge of duty is the result of sentiments of virtue  I know no method that will so effectually convince you how sincerely I am the friend of benevolence and the enemy of coercion or force as by detailing the facts and arguments by which I have myself been convinced nor can I by any other means so satisfactorily prove to you how unequivocally I am a friend to reform as by reminding you of what the present state of representation in this kingdom is and what are its consequences To these points then I once more entreat your patient strict and conscientious attention  I shall begin with coercion and as I shall have frequent occasion to use the term I request  you Gentlemen carefully to recollect that by coercion I mean that force which obliges a man to act or suffer without the consent and contrary to the decision of his understanding  No man I imagine will or can approve coercion unless it be intended to prevent crime We have therefore to enquire what is crime  Crime is unjust intention carried into effect  It is the nature of crime to begin with individuals but to expand and communicate to the whole To injure one man is to give an example of injury to all men violence produces violence and a first vice is followed by a train of vices the contagion of which quickly infects the whole community  It is likewise the nature of crime to injure him by whom it is committed It renders him suspected dreaded and odious and he can only be countenanced in proportion as the wicked example he gives is followed that is by an increase of danger to himself and all mankind If the injury of which he  is guilty be returned with excess we are then accustomed by comparison to exonerate him though in reality his crime is increased a hundred fold for while of two or two millions of crimes his may appear to be the least it is more fatal than any of those of which it is the origin All the crimes of a destructive war originate with him who first conceived that war  Selsishness is emphatically the characteristic of crime for the mistaken man who does a wrong act with a view to the good of others and without a retrospect to his own is certainly acting from virtuous intentions Supposing his action to be baneful his mind has the attribute of virtue  Since therefore the selfish criminal commits the greatest injury against himself whom he intended to benefit and the disinterested criminal is in like manner acting under mistake it follows that all crime is error of the understanding  Crime therefore is ignorance which is the absence or want of knowledge Consequently and this is one of the most important  of truths knowledge is the sole means by which crime can be prevented  If this reasoning be just it follows that to attempt to prevent crime by coercion is an error of the understanding or in other words is itself also crime  This may be elucidated by an inquiry into the nature and consequences of punishment which is one of the most important branches of coercion  Punishment is the infliction of pain and disgrace generally speaking either by the permission or at the instigation of society sometimes purposing to reform the criminal and at others not for criminals are frequently put to death but always with an intent to prevent crime  That to punish a man for being virtuous would be to commit injustice needs no proof Punishment therefore can only concern itself with real or supposed crime  It has already been proved that all crime is error of the understanding and that  Knowledge is the sole means by which crime can be prevented By knowledge is  here understood moral knowledge or the communication of those facts which teach men to generate happiness and prevent misery The more we examine the consequences of punishment the more we shall be convinced how incapable it is of communicating this kind of knowledge  Had punishment been an effectual means for preventing crime as soon as punishment had been begun crime must have been on the decrease  This effect however is not produced for men continue from the introduction of punishment to the present hour to be imprisoned pilloried whipped and hanged  Fear falshood revenge and desperation are the vices which punishment produces and even revenge and desperation are not so destructive as fear and falshood  Fear confuses distracts and debilitates the mind To prevent crime we must communicate knowledge Now the thing most essential for the acquirement of knowledge is that the mind should be clear and undisturbed and for the practice of the  virtues taught by knowledge that it should possess fortitude  With respect to the practice of falshood it teaches man not only to conceal from others but from himself his various deviations from rectitude and the more successfully he practices this deceit the more audacious and enterprizing he becomes Let us once more appeal to experience for proof  What are the effects of punishment What but inevitably to create a school for the exercise of the arts of falshood where the history of its transactions is read with delight and repeated for the encouragement and instruction of every novice Each tale has its hero arduous tasks are undertaken consequences are foreseen and guarded against fortitude and presence of mind for the perpetration of crime are cherished and rendered habitual and plans connected daring and successful are laid by which their authors with only a small change of circumstances would have gained immortal fame Such seminaries are our common  jails and such are the heroes they daily produce and daily deliver up to men paid and authorized to inflict on them varienties of disgrace punishment and death When a man from the perversity of his understanding has committed his first crime he is immediately sent to prison according to law that is Law dooms him to the society of men whose understandings are in a still more perverted state than his own Law which is emphatically stiled the wisdom of ages does this How would commonsense act Commonsense would instantly consign the criminal to the superintendence and admonition of the wisest and most virtuous men the nation could boast Men capable of great crimes are almost without exception men of extraordinary energy and enterprize and such men thus benevolently treated and instructed would become as active and indefatigable in good as they had been daring and restless in evil The criminal would be transformed to the sage Yet even this percicious practice of the law is outdone by the law A man  need not be criminal to be sent to prison he need only be accused and however innocent he may enter he must have more than common virtue if he do not come out guilty Such is coercion such is punishment  Punishment therefore is inefsicient it cannot extirpate crime this can only be effected by the communication of knowledge Hence  It is the duty of mankind to instruct but  It is the practice of mankind to punish  To instruct is to increase the well being of society  To punish is to increase the misery of society  But the most pernicious consequence that results to society is the following  Injustice is of a nature so destructive to well being that men cannot endure it without endeavours to provide against it in future Now by substituting a false mode of correction punishment they have lost sight of the true mode knowledge and thus they have lost what would have been  an incessant motive with them to propagate that very thing itself knowledge by which alone their well being can be secured and improved  The contradictions that spring from the system of violence are endless In one and the same breath the moralist recommends sincerity and secrecy though no two things can be more incompatible with and destructive of each other He classes them among the most eminent virtues though one of them cannot but be a pernicious vice for they are opposites in the extreme Where secrecy is sincerity cannot be and where sincerity is secrecy can have no existence Nothing can be more demonstrable for to speak with perfect sincerity there mus be no reserve but if only a part of the truth be told a part must be reserved therefore to speak only a part of the truth is not to speak with perfect sincerity  The virtue of habitual sincerity is easily proved for all men are agreed that to prevent injustice is a virtue now injustice cannot be committed till it be first conceived  in thought therefore to conceal thought is to conceal that by which the means of preventing injustice would be most effectually supplied  How contrary to this is the coercive principle of law which prohibits by pains and penalties the publication of thought Like an odious and a wicked tyrant it punishes seditious writings nay more seditious words that is it imposes under pains and penalties a system of lying or suppressing the genuine sentiments of our mind and thus the most pernicious of all vices is established by law a part of our education Thus men if they have erroneous opinions are forbidden that which alone can procure a remedy for this worst of diseases and thus the venom of falshood being forcibly pent up in the mind lies rankling there till it bursts forth with such pestilential virulence as not only to destroy its parent but to infect all society  The farther we pursue these inquiries the more we shall be convinced that punishment is the foe of knowledge is destructive  of liberty is incompatible with justice and that it engenders crime multiplies misery and murders intellect and its energies according to low  Gentlemen what I have said is but a feeble sketch of this desolating principle which I cannot contemplate without shuddering at the mischief it produces and feeling how totally inadequate not only my powers but those of any existing being are to detail its black and bloody annals It is by relieving my heart of this oppressive load by attempting to shew men how miserably they are mistaken and by zealous and incessant endeavours to persuade them to benevolence that I have so wounded their prejudices as to have subjected myself to the foul charge with which I here stand disfigured and at issue for life or death Oh could I but worthily treat the grand system of Benevolence for which I contend could I but call to your recollection the innumerable facts with which you are all acquainted that demonstrate its power of increasing the happiness of man I should  then indeed rejoice at the opportunity now afforded me and wholly disregarding personal danger should exult in being the organ of Truth and the benefactor of the human race Unequal however as I feel myself to a subject so gigantic I feel with still superior force that it is my duty to execute the task to the best of my ability I shall endeavour therefore to discover what true benevolence is to trace its consequences and to demonstrate their reality  Benevolence is the very opposite of crime it is just intention carried into effect  I am well aware how strenuously the advocates for coercion contend that punishment is benevolent and that punishment itself is just intention carried into effect I trust I have already proved the falsity of this assertion which if false is rendered fatal by being supposed to be true for were it not so supposed it could not be endured Extending the inquiry a little farther we are obliged to ask what is punishment but the infliction of pain  And does any human being while suffering pain contemplate the benevolence of that agent who is exercising himself in inflicting pain The stroke of the axe that severs the head from the body certainly brings no such conviction as little does the lash of the whip or the locks bolts and bars that prevent the emaciated and lifeweary prisoner from partaking of that air and exercise which would restore him to health freedom and well being  The infliction of pain it is said induces the patient to recollect and deeply fix in his memory the mistakes which occasioned punishment and that he may avoid pain he will carefully avoid mistake This is a strange error for it supposes that the lash of the whip actually does communicate knowledge Otherwise how is a man whipped enabled better to avoid mistake in future than he was before he was whipped The Law indeed includes the absurdity of supposing that all men are fully informed of all crimes their tendency and extent If it did not its tyranny would  be hateful even to those who at present most tenaciously assert its benignity To prove the error of this fiction would be loss of time So voluminous and complex is law that no learned professor in this court in this kingdom or that ever existed can remember its contents so perplexed are its precepts that they are for ever varying and so selfcontradictory are its precedents that they have destroyed all certainty and advocates the most able judges the most upright and juries the most conscientious when once entangled in its intricacies are in continual danger of exoncrating the vicious and condemning the guiltless Why is this High Court now solemnly assembled Oh misery to be remembered This High Court is now sitting robed in all its solemnities and all its terrors not to try me and my fellow victims to this system of confusion according to any definite and already declared principle but to make an experiment on the perplexities which Statute Law Precedent Law and Constructive Law so amply afford And on this  rotten thread have the lives of twelve men for days and weeks and months been pending If this be justice if this be benevolence if this be not the most violent exercise of the fundamentally erroneous system of coercion I must then confess myself utterly ignorant of that justice that benevolence which I had proposed to myself as the grand guides of human action  Gentlemen I have already had and shall again have occasion in the course of my defence to point out abuses that seem so incorporated in society that to destroy them will perhaps appear to involve the destruction of society itself Of these radical abuses coercion is the chief and law coercion and punishment we find to be all parts of a common system Now though I hope I have demonstrated to you that where law where coercion where punishment is misery must be yet I suspect that in thought you have asked with terror mingled perhaps with contempt  What would you throw open the prison doors and let loose a torrent of villains  robbers and murderers Is that your benevolent your wise advice  I answer No and for this plain reason because mankind instead of possessing the energy and virtue necessary to adopt such a plan would deem him a madman by whom it should be proposed But I conjure mankind to examine the principle and if punishment be an evil to keep this principle continually in view by which they will be prevented from making new laws for the inflicting of new pains and penalties and will be prompted to repeal the old as expeditiously as the state of public instruction will render it safe Yes Gentlemen I requst you will remember that this is the whole which the reform here insisted on requires I request you to keep in mind that however far the principles may progressively lead I insist only on following them now or at any time to the limits which the wisest men in the nation shall deem to be secure Do not call me a visionary or an enthusiast because I affirm that happiness begets happiness that a first good  leads to a second a second to a third a third to a fourth and so on everlastingly Examine whether the principles for which I contend be true and if they be follow truth as far as you can distinctly perceive it and clearly comprehend its operations Do not fear that such a disposition should lead you astray  To proceed What is the just intention in which benevolence consists and how is it carried into effect The just intention which constitutes benevolence is to increase the wellbeing of man and instead of inflicting to relieve him from pain The mode of effecting this intention is by attentively inquiring into the nature and cause of suffering by alleviating it with every imaginable remedy and by that assuaging consolation which a kind heart and an intelligent mind alone can afford How effectual is this lenient balm How eager is the criminal who by his mistakes has involved himself in sufferings to be relieved after this method How does he revere how love the hand that administers relief There is not a man on earth whose heart is so depraved as not  to dilate with pleasure under the exertions and influence of enlightened benevolence It is welcomed by the soolish and the wise the wicked and the good Nature is only lovely under its auspices and man is never so conscious of his capacity for virtue as when his heart teems with benevolence  For my own part here I stand the dagger is drawn the arm uplifted and the stroke aimed at my heart Is it any want of benevolence to endeavour to arrest the blow What matters it to me whether the assassin be a real being or that imaginary murderer the Law That phantom under whose form a hue and cry is raised to hunt me to perdition And what kind of man is it that is dragged to the stake and surrounded with the inflammable faggots of Suspicion False Alarm and atrocious Calumny Is it one who is a friend to the force of arms A preacher of violence An instigator to civil war No it is a man whose words and actions have been uniformly and strenuously combined to propagate peace a man who not with the cant of hired hypocrisy but  from the deep conviction of principle has been warning men against the horrors of that spirit of persecution and hatred in which he saw all parties so eager to indulge Yes from deep rooted long meditated principle Benevolence has been my system An undeviating unshaken friend to reform or I should not now have held my life in jeopardy but profoundly convinced that every act of force or violence is contrary to reform contrary to general and individual happiness and big with destruction to its agents of all parties the stumbling block of all ages and to remove which it is the duty of all men to exert every faculty of the soul  Should doubts still be entertained of the truth of these principles I have only to remark that I imagine it cannot be that you Gentlemen of the Jury should not perceive at present how deeply I at least am convinced of their solidity I will then leave it with your own consciences how far it is possible for a man holding these principles incessantly promulgating them as I have done and in the general tenor of my actions regulating my conduct by them to compass  or imagine the death of the king and its consequences an act which I never did nor ever can imagine which for the reasons already given I hold in utter abomination and which rather than compass myself or connive at in others if I had a thousand lives I would suffer a thousand deaths  The principles I have developed and the witnesses whose examination you have heard in proof that I have long held and long acted upon these principles cannot I think but be sufficient to convince you Gentlemen of the Jury that not the most minute taint of treason can attach itself to me But this is not sufficient I seek to be useful to mankind a large portion of whom will imagine that though not guilty of treason I have been meddling in matters that do not concern me An opinion of this kind has induced men who cannot but be wholly unacquainted with my character and conduct to calumniate me in various ways The Newspapers commonly called ministerial have heaped obloquy on me and my writings which however great may be my mistakes or their defects have constantly had the good  of mankind for their object These prejudices have pursued me in public and in private to the Theatre to the Councilchamber to Prison and to Judgment Yes Gentlemen since I have been in prison various newspapers by various means have endeavoured to excite or keep alive those prejudices against me which party spirit alone could generate Gentlemen I should not notice such trifling such mistaken and immoral attempts to traduce me but that you may perceive how necessary it is that a man in my situation should come forth after a trial thus solemn unspotted and fully restored to his former utility Yes thus awfully called upon it becomes me to assert and consequently to prove that I am something more than innocent and that I am now have been and if justice be done me again shall be actively virtuous This inevitably requires me to detail to this court and to the kingdom what have been my reasons for concurring with and aiding those men who have endeavoured to obtain a reform of parliament  Why are my powers thus feeble Can it be that the single word Parliament will not excite in you all those sensations which have so often rent my bosom at the foresight of evils which such a system if not timely peaceably and conscientiously purified must produce Gentlemen by the love of your children relations and friends by the love of your country by the love of the human race I conjure you to listen patiently attentively and I again repeat conscientiously to the momentous truths I am about to state The trumpet of alarm has been sounded against reformers Hear what reformers have to say in their own defence  It is a fact Gentlemen of public notoriety that a society called the Friends of the People a society so honoured in its members and so respectable for its patriotic and peaceful exertions that detraction has scarcely ventured to tax its purity I say it is well known that this society after a laborious scrutiny that will for ever be honourably recorded in the annals of  this country drew up and published a State of the Representation of England and Wales On this authority they founded a petition at once firm decorous and decisive The petitioners there state in express terms  that the number of representatives assigned to the different Counties is grossly disproportioned to their comparative extent population and trade that the elective franchise is partially and unequally distributed that the right of voting is regulated by no uniform or rational principle that by the ancient laws and statutes of this kingdom frequent parliaments ought to be held that from these combined defects arise those scenes of confusion litigation and expence which so disgrace the name of free representation that tumults disorders outrages and perjury are the dreadful attendants on contested elections that returning officers exercise discretionary powers with the most gross partiality and the most scandalous corruption that a disputed seat in parliament has been  known to cost one of the parties no less than fifty thousand pounds that appeals against false returns are a fresh source of expence maintained at the average sum to each party of a hundred pounds per day that the attornies' bill alone of one appeal which in point of form lasted only two days and in point of fact only six hours amounted to nearly twelve hundred pounds that the snameful practices which disgrace election proceedings have so loaded the table of the House of Commons with petitions for judgment and redress that one half of the seven years duration of parliament was scarcely sufficient to settle who is entitled to sit for the other half that the two gentlemen who sat and voted nearly three years as the representatives of the Borough of Stockwell had procured themselves to be elected by the most scandalous bribery that the two gentlemen who sat and voted during as long a period for the Borough of Great Grimstead had not even been elected  Gentlemen I here cite the language of the petition But what deserves your most serious attention is that these firm these patriotic these dignified petitioners did not come with a pompous recapitulation of popular assertions which some deny others assirm and none had ascertained but they came fully provided with facts for they add to each accusing clause the at once al rming and unanswerable sentence  And this your petitioners are ready to prove  Gentlemen this memorable this truth publishing petition did not stop here it gave a table of parliamentary patronage containing a list of Seventyone Peers and Ninetyone Commoners with their names at length who by nomination and influence return three hundred and two members to the House of Commons  The total number of members for England and Wales are five hundred and thirteen and the decided majority independently of the Treasury members independently of twentyeight members who are  returned by compromise independently of fortyfive additional members nominated by patronage in Scotland I say these seventyone peers and ninetyone commoners amounting together to one hundred and sixtytwo do themselves alone return a majority of ninetyone Is there any man who now hears me remind him of these noonday facts and who is yet an enemy to reform Can reason be so blinded Can truth be so powerless Can the love of our country and of the general good be so distant from the sense and feeling of my contemporaries  Do you still doubt Gentlemen of the necessity of a parliamentary reform  Why do I ask what are or what are not your doubts The Parliament is itself both Judge and Party Yes strange to tell Incredible to comprehension When this petition was debated in the House of Commons of three hundred and twentythree members present only fortyone had the virtue to vote in its favour To whom then can the men who discover the mischiefs  that impend appeal but to the people to the general understanding Till the tide of public opinion shall become irresistible what probability is there that such a House will reform itself  The petition I have cited was presented on the th of May the Friends of the People who presented it met on the th of the same month and in a resolution which they published with their petition there is the following passage  It is not say they a circumstance of little moment to the cause of reform that a petition stating to the House of Commons itself such facts and such arguments with a direct offer on the part of the petitioners to establish every one of their allegations by sufficient evidence should be received without dispute and recorded for ever on the Votes and Journals of the House No objection was made to the form or term of the petition no part of its contents was denied or even questioned the motion to bring up the petition was not opposed by any  man the House heard it distinctly read they ordered it to lie on their table and after a debate of two days refused to appoint a Committee to take it into consideration  Such Gentlemen was the language of these honest petitioners  Did the conscious rectitude of the House spurn at this open attack on its purity Did it endeavour to answer charges that thus proclaimed it corrupt to the very core Was there any man bold enough to assert the petitioners were traitors Gentlemen I repeat the Parliament that could receive listen to and treat such a petition in such a manner is all but incapable of self reformation Yet to be aware of this is the first step to treason to endeavour to learn whether the nation be or be not desirous that such a parliament should be reformed is more treason to declare after inquiring that there is not sufficient proof at present that such a desire does actually exist in the nation is triple treason to resolve that it were to be wished that the nation should so desire  is treason fourfold and farther to determine that as soon as this desire can by peaceable means be produced and not sooner virtuous individuals will then cooperate with the nation because that then parliament cannot refuse its attention is the very climax of treason If this be denied why am I here For a perception of the gross abuses I have noticed and an attempt at reform by these actual gradations are the sum and summit of my treason  Recollect Gentlemen the barefaced profligacy with which the traffick for Boroughs is carried on in the open face of day This traffick is reduced to a system and the traffickers have long since received the appropriate name of Borough Mongers You cannot be ignorant Gentlemen that at a general election these convenient dealers propose their ware wholesale to Government at a less price than it would produce if brought into the public market And why By this mode they avoid the fatigue of contest shun the danger of prosecution for bribery and which is an infinitely  more hazardous peril prevent the introduction of those restless reformers into parliament who were they admitted would endanger the craft Great is Diana of the Ephesians  The language of our spotless representatives is as inconsistent as their conduct is depraved At one time while every man out of the house is publicly talking of the sale of boroughs no man in the house is permitted to hint at the possibility of any individual member being capable of such corrupt practices or having entered those sacred walls by means so nefarious At another they are themselves prompted I will not inquire by what motive to speak out and "tell the secrets of the prisonhouse" Too delicate to point at individuals they attack the whole Thus for example Mr Pitt has made three efforts in Parliament to introduce a reform What was his language to our spotless representatives themselves in the very last of these attempts These were his words  To conquer the corruption that existed in the decayed boroughs he believed gentlemen  would acknowledge to be impossible The temptation were too great for poverty to resist and the consequence of this corruption was so visible that some plan of reform in the boroughs had clearly become absolutely necessary  Again  Could it not be proved that in this country estates so situated as to command an influence in a decayed or depopulated borough and to have the power of returning two members to parliament sold for more money than they would have done if situated in any other place However luxuriant the soil might be however productive its harvests unless its harvests could occasionally produce a couple of members its intrinsic value was less  These are Mr Pitt's words  Gentlemen I know not what your feelings may be but I own I cannot read a passage like this in which corruption that strikes at the very existence of civilized society is treated with the wantonness of wit without shuddering through all my frame And how does this sensation rise into horror  when I further recollect that this Mr Pitt the man who thus proclaimed the depravities of the house to the house itself and to the whole world is now the man who is labouring with the collective mass of that corrupt power which he once so unsparingly exposed to dye his hands in the blood of those who dare to imitate his example  What was the leading proposition in this last plan of Mr Pitt for reform It was in his own precise words  to recommend to the House the establishment of a fund for the purpose of purchasing the franchises of such boroughs as would sell He knew  he said satirically addressing himself to our uncontaminated parliament as if fearful of wounding its conscientious sensibility  he knew there was a sort of squeamish and maiden coyness about the house in mentioning this subject They were not very ready to talk in that house on what at the same time it was pretty well understood out of doors they had no great objection to namely to negotiate the purchase and the sale of seats  With what countenance can Mr Pitt after this meet the men for whose blood he has so eagerly sought There is but one odious answer he is a Prime Minister  What degree of practice is necessary for these our selfapproving representatives in the dictatorial tone of assumed virtue to declaim on the purity of their collective body and if any man unprotected by their sacred walls shall dare to question the honour of that house tax its integrity or impeach its proceedings overwhelm him with all their vengeance  And how does this integrity exhibit itself By a public avowal of the flagitious traffick In the advertisements for the sale of estates with what industrious art is it insinuated so as not to be misunderstood that there is this or that boroughinterest put up for barter  The Borough of Gatton within these two years was publicly advertised for sale by auction Observe Gentlemen not sold for a single parliament but the fee simple of the Borough with the power of nominating  the two Representatives for ever On the day of sale the celebrated auctioneer scarcely noticed the value of the estate The rental the mansion the views the woods and waters were unworthy regard compared to what he called  an elegant contingency  Yes Gentlemen the right of nominating two members to Parliament without the embarrassment of voters was  an elegant contingency  "Need I tell you Gentlemen" said he glancing round the room with ineffable selfsatisfaction and exulting in what he called  the jewel the unique which was under his hammer need I tell you Gentlemen that this  elegant contingency  is the only infallible source of fortune titles and honours in this happy country That it leads to the highest situations in the State And that meandering through the tempting sinuosities of ambition the purchaser will find the margin strewed with roses and his head quickly crowned with those precious garlands that flourish in full vigour round the fountain of honour On this halcyonsea  if any Gentleman who has made his fortune in either of the Indies chuses once more to embark he may repose in perfect quiet No hurricanes to dread no tempestuous passions to allay no tormenting claims of insolent electors to evade no tinkers' wives to kiss no impossible promises to make none of the toilsome and not very clean paths of canvassing to drudge through but his mind at ease and his conscience clear with this elegant contingency in his pocket the honours of the state await his plucking and with its emoluments his purse will overflow  Such was the meretricious oratory which a few months ago was thought a decent veil under which Vice might exhibit her hideous form in all the lascivious wantonness of ambiguity But we advance with hasty strides and the hypocrisy of decorum is no longer thought necessary The flimsy mask is so worn to tatters that its very owners are ashamed of the vile disguise and begin to speak in plain  termsIn the Times Saturday October th was the following paragraph  Counsellor Baldwin Secretary to the Duke of Portland  is to be  elected for the Borough of Malton  in the gift  of Earl Fitzwilliam  Observe Gentlemen  in the gift  Do you want more proof You shall have it public avowed proof given under the hand of a Peer In the Salisbury and Winchester Journal Monday October th may be found the following incredibly honest document  On Tuesday last the th September the annual Mayor's Feast at Westbury was held when an elegant and sumptuous entertainment was provided at which in addition to the numerous and very respectable attendance of the Gentlemen of the Borough and neighbourhood the Earl of Abingdon and Mr Estwick one of the members were present After dinner many loyal and constitutional toasts were drank such as  The King and ConstitutionThe Queen and all the Royal FamilySuccess to his Majesty's arms  both by sea and land c c  and then the health of  the Earl of Abingdon  being given his Lordship rose and addressed the company in a speech a copy of which being requested and obtained from his Lordship is as follows  Gentlemen  Whilst I rise to return you my best thanks for the honour you have done me in drinking my health with so much approbation I hope you will not think it a piece of vanity in me if I should flatter myself that my conduct toward the Borough of Westbury has in some degree at least rendered me not undeserving your favour for gentlemen let me tell you what I trust however you are not unacquainted with that although  by the Constitution  of the Country and the Laws of the land I have  an interest  in the representation of this Borough for returning the members who are to serve in Parliament I have never made use of that interest in any way whatever for my own advantage but always in such manner  as I thought would be most and best for the security of your  Rights and Liberties  and for the  benefit  of the public at large Other men possessed of  such  an interest might have converted it  as we know  to their own ambition as well as to their private emolumentI have done neither but on the contrary no member has ever been suffered to be at one shilling expence for his election having cheerfully borne that expence myself in order to render them more true to their trust That  I have been deceived  in some of the members is true but this is their fault and not mine in others I have thank God had the satisfaction of knowing that  I have not been deceived  particularly in one who is now present I mean my friend Mr Estwick who having invariably made the Constitution of the Country the law of his Parliamentary conduct as he has merited so I am persuaded he will continue to deserve the suffrage of the Borough of Westbury and having said this let me now give  you a toast Gentlemen  Prosperity to the free independent and incorrupt Borough of Westbury  Gentlemen of the Jury what shall we say Is this England Do we really see the sun Does its light shine upon us  Let me however be well understood it is not against the Earl of Abingdon that I would insinuate the most distant blame He it is true nominates observe Gentlemen nominates the two members for Westbury but his persuasion evidently is that this system of representation is virtuous and granting this strange supposition his mode of acting and sincerity in speaking are what every honest heart must applaud No It is the system itself it is the stage of audacious corruption it is the open infamy at which it is arrived that astonish and confound  No man yet has been able to calculate either the political or moral consequences of this system they are beyond the powers of calculation Of such however as I have at present any definite perception I  will endeavour to give you a feeble abstract  And here I must request you constantly to recollect that one hundred and sixtytwo persons return a decided majority of ninetyone in the representation of England and Wales only Can you Gentlemen can the nation be acquainted with this and remain ignorant that the real government of the country is in the possession of one hundred and sixtytwo persons At present these persons or an efficient number of them are bought by what is called the executive government but as their power is absolute their price is enormous To pay this price an enormous establishment is inevitable for these hundred and sixtytwo persons are a species of petty Princes who each has his retainers his train of dependents his agents without whose influence and aid his own power would be null and for all these provision must be made Of all others the pool of corruption is the most prolific agency begets agency till the noxious brood infects every office every  department every station of life From the peer to the exciseman from the prime minister to the parish beadle agents dependents creatures and the creatures of creatures are every where swarming The increase of them is incessant and the machine becomes so complicated so mischievous in its action and so hopeless of repair that even those who think themselves most benefited by its vices glance at it with terror and are panicstruck at the picture  Gentlemen this is a state that is impossible to be durable It will soon be found that carrion sufficient for the kennel cannot be procured and the pack will then devour their keepers if not prevented by another consequence which I am about to state  One hundred and sixtytwo persons return a decided majority to the House of Commons Gentlemen it is the want of organization only that prevents these hundred and sixtytwo persons from openly seizing the power of which they possess the reality and should the present system continue this organization must inevitably follow  and these persons who have already seized the legislative will as inevitably possess themselves of the executive government  Gentlement if I understand the intentions of government at present they are wholly bent on keeping things as they are But they are attempting an impossibility We know of nothing that is not subject to change and the only alternative we have is to better or worse If we dare look at facts and are not entirely blinded by our prejudices we shall confess that the changes with which the present system is pregnant have a general tendency to the worse and it appears to me to require no great depth of political sagacity to foretell that if we persist in rejecting reform or in other words a change for the better one of these consequences must follow Either the hundred and sixtytwo Peers and Commoners who now possess the reality of government will discover their collective strength and organize it to the destruction of the present system or should those contentions that  have hitherto divided them still continue a degree of corruption and taxation must result that would end in despotism or which is insinitely the most probable and against which I sincerely believe our present mistaken rulers wish to guard did they but know how the people will become so indignant by the evils they will feel and which are too gross entirely to escape the grossest ignorance that they will burst into that wild riot and savage fury in which by similar causes the people of France have so lately been plunged  Gentlemen I repeat change there must be for the better or the worse Yet the word innovation is continually bewildering our understandings And what is this phantom Innovation with which we have been haunted till our fears have entirely overwhelmed our discernment Is there any man so blind as not to know that innovation is inevitable Why do our Statutebooks annually swell with innovation Judge Blackstone tells us that these books contained when he wrote one hundred and sixty statutes the penalty  of which was death without benefit of clergy Judge Blackstone wrote in the year and in the indignation of his heart called it a dreadsul list which instead of diminishing increased the number of offenders yet the undeviating practice of the House of Commons is almost annually to multiply the number of penal statutes which inflict this horrid and most iniquitous punishment of death Is not this innovation What we may be allowed to hang each other as frequently as we please But to attempt to correct our abuses is treason And treason again demands capital punishment Nay to put the matter in a still more shocking point of view we thus are taught that our wise and humane representatives will pass act after act to take away the fortunes liberties and lives of their constituents but not one to correct that abominable corruption for which if men could deserve hangingNo no I will not sinish my sentence Men cannot deserve death They deserve our aid our instruction our love And if so must not humanity blush at the sanguinary pages which these impeccable  legislators each time they meet consult how they may render more sanguinary  Gentlemen these Commons vote taxes these Commons vote excise laws these Commons vote lotterybills these Commons vote statutes to hang you and these Commons vote armies to carry the whole of their votes into execution Your safety your liberty your lives are not in your own keeping but in the keeping of an Oligarchy of one hundred and sixtytwo peers and commoners All that is dear to you does not depend on that justice which is the emanation and the pride of reason but it depends on Yes and No and to deny that Yes and No are argument justice and happiness is Treason  The difficulty of raising supplies in order to drag heavily forward the unwieldy ark which cracks in every joint and threatens destruction to shameless vice that dances naked around it I say this difficulty is so great that means which are at once the most offensive to the feelings of  the people and the most pernicious to their morals are inevitably adopted What is more execrated or more execrable than a lotterybill which annually receives the solemn sanction of King Lords and Commons for tradesmen to cheat their creditors servants and apprentices to rob their masters children to pilfer their parents the poor to pawn the very rags that conceal their nakedness and the whole nation to gamble with the express encouragement of law Gentlemen this is an act of such incredible error that though we know it to be true we are tempted to doubt if it can exist What King Lords and Commons join in solemnly enacting a law that authorizes and stimulates to such innumerable vices King Lords and Commons do this It is false No man will believe it No man dare assert it It were a million of treasons to imagine them guilty of mistakes so palpable and so pernicious Gentlemen my heart aches it bleeds and has bled in secret ten thousand times at the dreadful recollection Does it require the gift of  prophecy to foretell that the political consequences of such a system of political morality must be social destruction The remedy is at hand gentle gradual and peaceful reform But they will neither take nor administer the necessary medicine No to offer them the sanative draught is Treason  Gentlemen I am here upon life and death This is no time for me to soften down Truth till it assume the guise of Falsehood and if it be I will not accept of life upon such terms I pity the mistakes of men and I have already declared it to be my creed that the worst of crime is but error of the understanding yet I own myself utterly astonished at the inconsistency of those men who were themselves the boldest inquirers in the year into the crying abuses that threaten the state with ruin and who in the year could institute a prosecution against an individual of my principles for High Treason But vain is the warning voice though one should rise from the dead they  will not be persuaded Yet again and again I will exclaim to them Beware of the hundred and sixtytwo Beware of the Oligarchy Beware of ironhanded Despotism Beware of gorestreaming Civil War Have pity on the people have pity on yourselves and REFORM And if this be treason welcome DEATH I am ready  Well I am a traitor and I conspire with other traitors who meditate plans of reform  Oh could this traitor but detail the fearful facts could he indeed rouse you to a sense of the mischief that our political errors engender and which are so fatally familiarized to us that even while they are seen they are not observed there is not a man that hears him who would not instantly exclaim as I do Reform Reform Reform But I feel my powers wholly unequal to the effort  And yet strange to think we daily see public sensibility so morbid to national and to general happiness as to testify dissatisfaction  for the want of news if some dreadful battle have not been fought some miserable city laid in ruins some province inundated or some country not suffering all the horrors of famine and all these horrors created by the destructive errors of Prime Ministers Lords and Commons Oh welcome death indeed when I shall behold this and not dare to proclaim the vice or when I shall tremble to pronounce Famine Prime Ministers Lords and Commons in the same breath Should they be offended my answer is ready  REFORM  Hang draw and quarter me if you please but Reform  An Empress but lately sent her blooddrenched hell hounds to massacre thirty thousand defenceless persons in the city of Ismael An Empress The dreadful tale was stated in our daily papers as a common occurrence and read with infinitely less emotion than would have been excited by a paragraph of a single domestic murder With this Empress who had made treaties in the name of the Holy Trinity  with the Poles our ministers also made reaties and in the name of the Holy Trinity To more treaties with more Imperial Majesties Kings Potentates and Princes who had human butchers ready trained to slaughter human beings and bring them to the shambles of Aristocratical Princely and Imperial vengeance the name of the Holy Trinity was again and again invoked The treaties were made and the dogs of war unleashed Rape fire and sword were insufficient redhot balls too lenient fraud forgery and famine must swell the hellborn troop Swindling fraud and wholesale forgery must combine under the sanction of treaties proclaimed in the name of the Holy Trinity Famine Oh God Oh God Devouring famine must hasten in the name of the Holy Trinity to the destruction of twentyfive millions of men And shall this Ismael Heroine this thirty thousand souled Empress shall these Holy Trinity Prime Ministers shall these fraud forgery and Famine Potentates not hear of their  horrors Will a nation thus implicated in these infamous transactions know these things and be silent Or should they have not twentyfive millions of men one tongue among them to publish the black narrative  To whom do these twentyfive millions of men attribute the murders of the guillotine the massacres of Lyons the devastations of La Vendée and the unheard of miseries to which France for these two years has been a witness and to all of which wonderful to relate she is rising superior To whom but to Brunswick Pitt and Cobourg Names held there in more universal abhorrence than ever were those of Caligula and Nero  Gentlement I know not how to make myself understood While seeking to bring to your recollection the iniquities that error begets I feel myself using the language to which the passions the miseries and the mistakes of men have given birth I may seem to foster a malignity against individuals of which I do most solemnly  protest I am not conscious in my heart May the greatest good that can befall man suddenly be theirs May they awaken to a sense of the ruin they have occasioned and be freed from those errors of the understanding which have been the origin of all their crimes This is all the harm I either do or ever can wish to man and may this harm if it be harm be mine I plead to convince you of the necessity of reform and of the deep and everlasting impression which this necessity has made upon my mind Yes gentlemen if to endeavour at reform be treason pronounce me guilty at once Sweep such a mistaken wretch from the face of the earth and let him vex the world no more for while I live and while I can discover error I must and will warn mankind to reform  Some few of the political and moral consequences of our parliamentary depravity I have enumerated but who can enumerate them all "I have bought you and I will "sell you" is the proverbial language of our immaculate members Put the question  home to your consciences gentlemen what can be the morality of these buyers What the morality of the bought What sense of moral dignity what degree of honest determined sincerity what quantity of disinterested rectitude can either possess These representatives are incessantly busied in making laws nor is there a statute that they pass in which the happiness of the nation is not most seriously involved On this happiness their attention ought to be unshakenly fixed the good of mankind their uniform and sole motive Ask yourselves gentlemen is this the purpose can this be the motive of men who accept their seats on the vile condition of voting as their patron shall please who enter the house without having considered any question yet predetermined to decide on all Are such men the moral mongers of the nation  What are the effects produced by the institutes of which men are at present so tenacious Why these institutes confine the poor to continual labour by which they  are wholly deprived of leisure These institutes fix them in a degree of want that precludes them the benefit of common necessaries These institutes impel them to seek relief from their miseries in that forgetfulness which inebriety promotes These institutes stimulate them to pilser by robbing them of the enjoyments in which their lawgivers riot These institutes teach them selfishness by convincing them that if they do not hoard they must starve These institutes inculcate and habituate them to revenge by inflicting punishment and violence as the only mode which these institutes know of correcting mistake  It has often been affirmed that the poor are incorrigible Gentlemen there is a melancholy and heartrending truth lurking under this in other respects abominable assertion There is no law of mind which renders a poor man less capable of virtue than a rich nor indeed are his vices half so numerous or half so odious No it is not a law of mind but if I may be allowed the figure it is the law of no mind the law  of ignorance which is imposed upon the poor by the labour and the wretchedness to which they are reduced  Gentlemen the mischiefs of poverty are not that it deprives the poor of the trappings and fooleries of the luxurious rich but that it robs them of their time as well as of the means of acquiring knowledge It is knowledge alone that can render the heart beneficent the head comprehensive and the whole man wise and virtuous To rob man of knowledge is to be guilty of the worst of crimes and of this crime I boldly accuse our lawgivers our nonreforming representatives our oligarchical one hundred and sixtytwo  And well it is that I am speaking here in this open court where I have too many hearers and too honest to admit of misinterpretation for were I addressing myself in a small room to eight or ten persons with but half the freedom and the energy which here are virtue it would there be treason One of the ten would be a spy and an informer who would alter and transpose and clip and carve my sentences  to fit the treasonable model his employers had provided Thus should I happen to mention that forty of the Tower guards had one day marched to the tunes of Ca ira and La Carmagnole he would forget what was convenient for a spy not to remember and using my own words arranged after his own ingenious method and with as little interpolation as can be expected from a spy would swear that I and forty Carmagnoles were to march to the tune of Caira and guard the Tower Yes he would swear these were my very words and his conscience would exult in the literal honesty of its cunning Such would certainly be my danger were I unconsciously in the company of these documented and dressed up gentlemen whom no man now knows how to avoid Nay I will not affirm that even this High Court at this moment is not contaminated by their presence Miserable system which cannot exist without such supporters And tenfold miserable when it has arrived at that degree of open infamy as to induce a tribunal of justice to screen  its promoters under the pretence that state secrets are not to be divulged  Gentlemen I pretend to no supernatural powers I am neither priest nor prophet Levite nor Reevite yet this I dare venture to foretell that when we have reform we shall not have spies What a state of existence is that in which brother suspects brother servants are bribed to betray their masters and associations are planned in every parish for the avowed purpose of paying spies and informers I would not it is true be guilty of treason or of suicide to rid myself of such wretches but rather than walk the streets in fear of them rather than dread they should haunt me in coffeehouses glide before me into all public places and even start up by my own fireside to appal me I would suffer all that their employers and paymasters Prime Ministers Lords Commons Associators and Recvites could inflict  Gentlemen I seem to myself to have strangely debased the dignity of my subject even though that subject be the corruption  of parliament by thus dipping into its very dregs but when we recollect the poison that these dregs engender poison which envenoms the whole state of social existence infuses itself into every heart and there broods suspicion hatred perjury and rancour only fit for fiends it then may surely help to fix more deeply in your memory the necessity of peaceful reform and a conviction that the man who could see only the few mischiefs I have detailed was not guilty of treason when he endeavoured to procure that reform without which destruction must overtake us all  Examine the moral consequences of your Excise laws The security in which rectitude indulges is lost among those who are subject to them Suspicion a desire of furtive concealment hypocrisy cunning and perjury become their inmates We scarcely find an instance in which these persons do not openly proclaim their hatred of that government which has rendered them subject to so much oppression  What are the persons who immediately see  these laws carried into execution Are they not men stigmatized and obnoxious to community And how does the law treat them It allows them a poor stipend and commits to them a dangerous and a tempting trust It stimulates them to break their oaths rob their employer forfeit their character and in every respect render themselves the contempt of society Yet these are comparatively petty evils the Excise Laws must be encouraged no matter at what expence of public morality and all the vices which the brawls obscenity and filth of gin shops can breed must not only be endured but promoted  These Excise Laws are swelled to a monstrous bulk In general they are parts and parcels of other acts in the body of which they are inserted and lie so scattered through the statutes at large that the commissioners of government have found it expedient to collect them and to add a copious index I never saw the book it is a treasure reserved only for the initiated for Commissioners or men high in office in  the Excise It is printed for their use at the expence of government and every officer entrusted with a copy is obliged to give a bond of two hundred pounds to return the book when demanded It contains all the parts of a plan which the contrivers of it dread should be inspected The trader who is subject to these laws may search the statutes at large and discover how he may pay due obedience to them if he can The Philosopher a still more noxious animal to a statesman may wade through the mire of these statutes at large and waste a life in reading acts of parliament that he may make those extracts from each act which relate to the Excise the mischiefs of which it is his duty and his desire to make public But so it is Government in all cases seems to place its security in the ignorance of the governed and there is no creature that it hates so much or flies with such antipathy and panic terror as from an enquirer He will detect its errors and its errors and its existence are supposed by itself to be so interwoven  as inevitably to live and die together If it did not so suppose the question of the liberty of the Press could never have been started men of enquiry could not have been nicknamed in order to be hunted down and an advocate of peaceful reform could not have stood at this bar arraigned for High Treason  How can I quit this subject this necessity of reform Imagination conjures up the picture of a general election when the whole kingdom affords a tumultuous scene of depravity such as every friend of man shrinks from with anguish Impelled by a torrent which he cannot resist the wise and good man yields and oh fatal necessity becomes an actor in it But surely Gentlemen it is not Cimmerian darkness with us it is not total eclipse What Can the wise and good man be a spectator of drunkenness bribery perjury bludgeon men and murder and not know they exist Who can have a full image and conception of the feelings of those great good and noble minded men who from a firm sense  of duty and which may seem more paradoxical an unbounded love of the mad wretches whom they could not guide have been compelled to be the principal actors in these loathsome and lunatic tragedies  Gentlemen in vain do I toil to fill up a picture the miseries of which are endless I abandon it in despair I leave it to the faithfulness of your own memories I resign it to the general feelings of mankind Its tendency is too evident for me to fear that its mischievous properties will not daily become more and more visible The wish at present nearest to my heart is that those who have the power to begin reform may suddenly have the will and that they will no longer insult the public by exercising the worst arts of the worst of times to stigmatize the friends of the human race through the medium of an accusation for high treason  And here Gentlemen implicated as I am in these legal asperities it is my duty to call your attention now and the attention of mankind hereafter to that abominable  law record an indictment In language the most virulent this calumniating instrument deforms the sweet aspect of a well spent life and by its assertions changes the fair face of virtue to the black and hideous visage of a fiend It does not inquire if a brother have done wrong a mistaken brother whom it benevolently intends to benefit but bursting into all the rage of passion it accuses blindfold and describes him who had before been thought a man of virtue as possessed by vices that would disgrace a demon It practises acknowledged falsehoods which its fabricators call fictions and plunging its object in a torrent of legal venom then leaves the poor suffocated wretch to escape and purify himself as he can  Feeling as I did that I had deserved well of my country knowing how incessantly I had laboured to discover and though frequently erroneous to practise virtue what were my emotions while I listened to the monotonous gabble of such an unintelligible and slanderous jargon Did I ever  said I imagine I should live to hear abuse so lavished on me That I should be summoned to hear it too in the presence of grave men who are so intent upon being solemn that they dress themselves in garments such as no man ever saw unless at plays and puppetshews lest they should forget to act solemnity well  This indictment says that these false traitors I being one met and assembled in Saint Giles's I have had numberless occasions to pass through the precincts of Saint Giles though never to meet traitors there I have seen the blue balls with which they abound sure tokens of vice and wretchedness have remarked the ginshops with anguish and have heard their blasphemies with disgust But Saint Giles himself with all his ruffians makes no such ruffian attacks nor in such set and ruffian like phrase as this grave ridiculous and false this unintelligibly accurate and definitely incomprehensible instrument of jurisprudence an indictment  Gentlemen I do but recapitulate facts  It is not my fault that such is law I speak in the presence of lawyers men acknowledged to be the first in their profession To some of them I am indebted for an attempt on my life and what is infinitely more precious my honest fame my moral existence and future utility to others for the defence of these inestimable blessings What I have this day had occasion to say concerning law I am well aware must have excited their mutual amazement and perhaps their mutual indignation I wish not to offend but I own that I in my turn am amazed to recollect that the facts innumerable of all nations and of all ages and in few so abundant as in this nation and in this age I say I am utterly astonished that these facts can be so completely forgotten by the persons under whose eye and whose agency they are so incessantly transacted What have they neither hearing sight nor sense Are they so eager in the pursuit of new errors that they have not a moment to glance at the past  Far be it from me to depreciate the individual  I speak only of the profession As men they frequently possess the most dignified virtues of man as in this contest has been most eminently proved as lawyers they are what law has made them as has in this contest been no less clearly demonstrated  Gentlemen secure in the conscious rectitude of good intention let me lay bare my heart to you Perhaps you think I have spoken with too little reverence of antient forms and institutions which however they may shun the test of reason may yet demand respect I know this is the opinion of many I cannot help it that it is not mine If I am in an error I sincerely wish to be better informed but I confess that at present I feel no more reverence for the trappings of antiquity than I do for a fool's cap and bells I think them equally ridiculous and derogatory Yet while I would gladly prevail on every wearer of them to strip himself of such insignia of vice and folly I would not move a finger in the way of force to wrest them  from the characters whom I think they disgrace No till we can persuade their fond owners to tear them away with their own hands there let them remain It is a most sacred duty to proclaim the folly but it is a duty still more sacred if possible not to persecute the fool Let those who think that bywords weasel skins the entrails of worms and the white and yellow dirt of Peru can dignify the human character continue so to think till instruction can cure them of their error for my own part I cannot respect absurdity but I should be a vicious and a dangerous man could I attempt to offer it violence I know that all this is no part of the creed of my accusers I know that in their code it is high treason If you Gentlemen think it so if you can discover any intention in me to excite insurrection civil war and to depose the King and put him to death let me suffer all the horrors which the law has decreed against traitors for till I am convinced I will not recant one syllable  Gentlemen of the Jury thus far I have  been pleading as if there had been in my case as there is always supposed to be some ground of charge some colour of suspicion some specific accusation and forthcoming accusers to induce the authors of this prosecution to bring me into the horrid predicament in which I stand that of being proclaimed a traitor to my country an enemy to mankind and of holding my life at the hazard of the mistakes which the acrimony and prejudice of the moment might beget or the intricacies of law and the subtleties of lawyers might produce The wickedness of the attempt they have made upon my life is so incredible that since this most strange Grand Jury strangely returned the Indictment presented against me a true bill I have daily and involuntarily asked myself 'Is it possible Am I dreaming Is the 'whole world mad Or am I alone a madman' Gentlemen I had a list of two hundred and eight witnesses given me with my indictment few very few of whom in the whole course of my life I had ever seen or heard of and the remainder were every  one of them persons on whom I have called and whose testimony you have heard directly and flatly disproving in the most solemn manner the crimes thus wickedly laid to my charge Nearly two hundred unknown witnesses to come forward and prove upon me that I had conspired to excite insurrection rebellion and war to depose the King and to put him to death This enormous infamy I am taxed with and this cloud of witnesses are assigned under my prosecutors' own hand to come upon oath and substantiate my guilt at the moment I knew it to be impossible for any man on the face of the earth to prove such crimes on me This list is formally delivered to me by the Solicitor for the Treasury in the presence of his two Clerks who are to depose to its safe delivery But what will you say sitting here as you do the Judges of your country when you shall recollect that instead of having as my prosecutors asserted two hundred and eight witnesses to prove me guilty of rebellion war and putting the King to death they had no one witness  to prove my guilt but that they had several who in the very beginning of the Privy Council's inquiries had uniformly deposed to the peacefulness of my principles and actions Yes Gentlemen the members of the Society for Constitutional Information whom they that is Mr Pitt Mr Dundas the Lord Chancellor Mr Reeves and the whole Privy Council interrogated concerning me gave testimony to my being a declared enemy to all force One of the witnesses subpoenaed on this trial against me told the Grand Jury that so far from being in a conspiracy to excite insurrection I was a natural Quaker which he explained by words importing that I had the peaceful morality of the Quakers without their spiritual inspirations  Gentlemen the stretch of conscience of a Statesman is to me unfathomable How Mr Pitt how Mr Dundas how the Lord High Chancellor of these realms can reconcile these things to their hearts what their feelings are what their waking thoughts and what their sleeping I cannot divine  Could men of such gigantic and incomprehensible State morality listen to the advice of one whom they have denounced a traitor I would conjure them instantly to revise their past conduct to consider whether the constructive treasons which they have endeavoured to prove upon twelve men may not with insinitely less violence be turned to their own destruction whether their conduct or mine has been most calculated to excite insurrection rebellion and war with the other dreadful consequences the horror of which forbids their recapitulation whether it be reconcileable to their morality thus to labour the death of an individual who were they at this moment in danger would exert his whole faculties such as they are to prevent not only the shedding of their blood but all possible harm from happening to them and who had he the power to do them good would from principle conceive himself as irrevocably bound to do good to them as to any and to every other human being Yes Gentlemen when I publish the errors they  have committed it is not to injure these men but to prevent them from injuring all mankind And for this great end to further this everlasting cause the cause of truth and the good of the whole I will again brave personal danger and all the miseries which mistaken and injurious men can heap on my head  Gentlemen you have heard my accusers you have heard my witnesses you have heard my defence Against my prosecutors personally who have instigated the accusation that has brought me into this perilous state I deliberately declare I feel no resentment though certainly I can conceive few horrors equal to those which they have sought to bring upon me My property they have wasted the means by which I supported my family they have for a time cut off my character they have attempted to blast But as all these injuries and every other that man can commit are absolutely no more than errors of the understanding to be angry at them is as irrational as it is unwise I hope the fearful proceedings  of this whole prosecution will be a lesson too deeply impressive to be ever forgotten by them and that they and all men will be more and more averse to the shedding of blood Should I live and should these prosecutors still remain unconvinced of their mistakes I will never cease to raise my weak voice to warn them and the world against what I believe to be mistakes so pernicious But in doing this strict truth and the good of mankind shall be my guides and if any bitterness of recollection should ever induce me to alter or disguise the truth I can honestly say it will be from some undetected mistaken feeling and not from any principle of revenge which I consider as a heinous and highly mischievous crime  With respect to my witnesses I could easily have doubled the number My first care was to select such whose character would not disgrace this High Tribunal of Justice and my next to cite persons of different ages and opposite parties that you Gentlemen of the Jury might be convinced  my principles and conduct on all occasions were the same You have now only to decide The sentence for this crime is  That the culprit shall be taken from the Bar and conveyed to the place from whence he came and from thence be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution there to be hanged by the neck but not until he is dead he shall be taken down alive his privy members shall be cut off and his bowels shall be taken out and burnt before his face his head shall be severed from his body and his body shall then be divided into four quarters which are to be at the King's disposal and the Lord have mercy on his soul  Gentlemen though I hold it impossible for any human being to merit so offensive a punishment yet as I am afraid I am singular in this opinion I do not mean to appeal to your humanity but to your justice and if I am a traitor if I have compassed or imagined the death of the King if you have any sort of proof that can justify such a verdict to your own consciences then pronounce  me Guilty and let my members be cut off my bowels burnt my head severed from the trunk and my body divided into four quarters and sent to be at the King's disposal for it matters little to me whether it be at the King's and the hangman's or the vultures' and the wolves'  FINIS
