trades I'll sing it you  AIRGOSSIP  When I was a younker I first was apprentic'd  Unto a gay barber so dapper and airy  I next was a carpenter then turn'd a dentist  Then taylor good Lord then an apothecary  But for this trade or that they all come as pat they can  For shaving and toothdrawing bleeding cabbaging and sawing  Dickey Gossip is the man  Tho' taylor and dentist but aukwardly tether  In both the vocations I still have my savings  And two of my trades couple rarely together  For barber and carpenter both deal in  shavings  So for this trade or that They all come as pat c  But blunders will happen in callings so various  I fancy they happen to some who are prouder  I once gave a patient whose health was percarious  A terrible dose of my best  shaving powder  But no matter for that my trades come as pat c    Exeunt  SCENEThe Salloon  Enter  VAPOUR  I've slipt from Sir Matthew to take another look at the object of my passion my passionmy follyOh that I was born three
