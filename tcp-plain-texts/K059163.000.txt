 A  Declaration of Truth  TO BENJAMIN HOADLY One of the High Priests of the Land AND Of the Degree whom Men call BISHOPS  By a Ministring Friend who writ to  Tho Bradbury  a Dealer in many Words  LONDON  Printed for  E More  near St  Paul  's and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price Six Pence  A Declaration of TRUTH TO  Benjamin Hoadly  BE it known unto thee Friend  Benjamin  that albeit we who are the People of the Lord own thee not in thy proud Titles neither in thy Office as thou exercisest the same neither can we treat thee with that Distinction wherewith Men distinguish thee forasmuch as we do not acknowledge the same as thou dost to be of God Nevertheless I shall treat thee respectfully in this thing whereof I am now to commune with thee seeing thou hast uttered much Truth with thy Mouth and therefore hast moved much Wrath of wicked Men against thee  And would'st thou  Benjamin  faithfully pursue the Light which I perceive is in thee and which shineth abroad far and nigh I say would'st thou act according to the Light which I plainly see is in thee thou should'st have Praise for thou hast verily  done worthily  in that thou hast restored the Kingdom  to them to whom it solely appertaineth and hast dethroned the Usurpations of wicked Men who have unrighteously set themselves up in the Throne of Jesus  Verily  Benjamin  thou hast done worthily in that thou hast appeared for the Cause of our God against the Unrighteousness of Men and hast not been afraid neither discouraged when they have risen up against thee with great Wrath And I am sent unto thee to declare in words of Seriousness that thou should'st not faint neither be dismay'd for that many of the Faithful Servants of God are with thee in this thing and do say unto thee  God speed  which thou knowest we are forbidden to say unto the ungodly and unto Men who are not led in the right way  Having thus given my Testimony to thy good Works I communicated my Intentions to Friends Among these  Aminadab  a righteous Man fearing not the Face of Men but fearing God only  saith unto thee  that his Heart is likewise with thee in the things which thou hast said  to wit  That the Power of Men or the Laws of Men have no Authority to interfere with or to join their Power with the Right Hand of Jesus who allows no Partners in the Throne of his Glorious Kingdom on Earth any more than he will admit Partners in the Throne of his  Glorisy'd Kingdom in Heaven Moreover he hath sent Messengers unto me saying Speak thou  Ebenezer  in the Ears of  Benjamin Hoadly  and say unto him Fear not the Face of Men tho' many rise up against thee saying Thou lyest thou lyest for verily thou lyest not  Benjamin  but hast spoken the Truth and it shall prevail  Aaron  a Man filled with Knowledge and a Teacher of Wisdom sent also unto me saying  Ebenezer  the thing which  Aminadab  our Friend hath communicated unto thee concerning  Benjamin Hoadly  are things which savour of Truth and thou wilt do well to speak unto the said  Benjamin  saying Fear not  Benjamin  for wise Men are with thee and good Men are with thee and verily they be better Men and more in number that are with thee than those that be against thee  I might name unto thee many Friends endowed with Wisdom and Knowledge who speak well of thee for that thou hast spoken the Truth with great boldness and hast not feared to utter it even in the hearing of the King and we may not doubt but that our Lord the King will be thy strong Helper against all thine Enemies and will assist thee to silence the Gainsayers of thy Doctrine for verily the King is an unfeigned Friend unto the Truth and would be willing that  all Men should walk in the path to Heaven howbeit he may not be inlightned equal to our Friends which nevertheless we hope he may hereafter be if God seeth it good to bring his Heart over unto us  And albeit Friend  Benjamin  thou art not yet joined unto the faithful Servants of God our Friends but that thou for a little while remainest as to some things in the Darkness of the World yet forasmuch as thou joinest with us in the Truth we embrace thee willingly nothing doubting but that the Heavenly Light which has shone out in thy Word will hereafter shine in thy Heart and thou wilt come over more perfectly unto us Friends who are already established in the Truth  And I am the farther confirm'd in the truth hereof in that thou hast so boldly acknowledged the Truths of God being the same professed by us and for the sake whereof we are inclin'd to think well of thee and seeing I have informed thee that thou hast so exactly taught what we in Principle believe and closely adhere to in Practice I shall let thee know  Benjamin  how exactly thou agreest with us who have received the Truth and that we hold and believe all the Truths that thou hast taught and that also even in the same words in which thou hast declared them or but with small variation  thereof as thou wilt farther be informed when thou shalt read the following Heads which are part of  the Principles of Truth or of those things about Doctrine which we Friends do most surely believe and recieve  to wit  Concerning Religion we believe that it is only the Spirit of the Lord that makes Men truly Religious and no Man ought to be compelled to or from any exercise or practice in Religion by any outward Law or Power but every Man ought to be left free as the Lord shall perswade his own mind in doing or leaving undone this or the other practice in Religion and every Man of what Profession in Religion soever ought to be protected in Peace provided himself be a Man of Peace not seeking the wrong of any Man's Person or Estate  And we believe That to reprove false Opinions and unsound Doctrines and Principles seeking to convince them that oppose themselves by Exhortation or sharp Reproof by word or writing ought not to be counted a breach of the Peace or to strive about the things of the Kingdom of God by Men of contrary Minds or Judgments this ought not to be punished by the Magistrates and their Laws for we believe that the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are only to preserve Mens Persons and Estates and not to preserve Men in Opinions neither ought the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon Mens  Consciences to bind them to or from such a Judgment or Practice in Religion  And we believe That Christ is and ought only to be Lord and Exerciser of Mens Consciences and his Spirit must only lead into all Truth  And we believe That Obedience and Subjetion in the Lord belongs to Superiors and that Subjects ought to obey them in the Lord that have rule over them and that Children ought to obey their Parents and Wives their Husbands and Servants their Masters in all things which is according to God which stand in the exercise of a pure Conscience towards God But where Rulers Parents or Masters or any other command or require Subjection in any thing which is contrary to God or not according to him in such cases all People are free and ought to obey God rather than Man and we believe that herein God will justifie them being guided and led by his Spirit in all that which is good and out of all that which is evil  Herein Friend  Benjamin  thou mayest see as in a Vision of clear Light that thou art in the same way of Truth with us and I have Freedom to own thee therein for verily thou hast clearly testified unto  the Truth which we believe  in that thou hast likewise said even in our Words  That every Man ought to be left free as the Lord shall perswade his own Mind  Now  Benjamin  let it not seem strange unto thee that I say unto thee that these are our own Words for I speak therein with Truth and Soberness referring thee for Testimony thereof unto a little Book published more than Forty and Five Years since by a Body of our Friends and Signed by  John Crook  a Man endowed with a Spirit of a sound Mind and also by three other Ancients who were likewise Men of true Wisdom This Book is Entituled  Truth's Principles  c in which Book the Words which I have written unto thee above are to be found  Searching likewise thy Book  Benjamin  which thou hast made Publick by the Command of the King I find these Words which I hope thou hast learned from our Friends above written to wit That the Language of the Word is  That knowing the Terrors of the Lord we  should  perswade Men  but that the Language of the Mens Conduct who profess to succeed Him that Taught the other is That having the Terrors of this World in their power they do not perswade Men but  force their outward Profession against their inward Perswasion  Verily thou hast spoken  Benjamin  as one having the Light of the Spirit and this is a Truth which the Men of the World cannot be able to resist Verily Friend  Benjamin  we agree with thee that the Kingdom of  Jesus is not of this World and that the Laws of his Kingdom likewise and the Rewards and Punishments of those Laws are suited to the end of those Laws and to the Nature of his Kingdom Nay  Benjamin  I will use thy Words as thou hast used the Words of wise Men who went before thee to wit  "The  Laws  of this  Kingdom  therefore as  Christ  left them have nothing of  this  World in their view not Tendency either to the Exaltation of  Some  in wordly Pomp and Dignity or to their absolute Dominion over the Faith and Religious conduct of  Others  of his Subjects or to the erecting of any sort of  Temporal Kingdom  under the Covert of Name of a  Spiritual  One"  "The  Sanctions  of  Christ's Law  are  Rewards  and  Punishments  But of what sort Not the Rewards of this Worlds not the Offices or Glories of this State not the Pains of  Prisons Banishments Fines  or any lesser and more  moderate Penalties  nay not the much lesser  Negative Discouragements  that belong to  Humane Society He  was far from thinking that  These  could be the Instruments of such a  Perswasion  as He thought acceptable to God But as the Great End of his  Kingdom  was to guide Men to Happiness after the short Images of it were over  here below so he took his  Motives  from that place where his  Kingdom  first began and where it was at last to end from those  Rewards  and  Punishments  in a future State which had no relation to this World And to shew that his  Kingdom was not of this World  all the  Sanctions  which He thought fit to give to  His Laws  were  not of this World  at all"  I confirm these thy Positions and Doctrines  Benjamin  with my Voice and give thee Praise therefore for verily thou art worthy of Praise not only that thou hast spoken boldly the Truth but for that thou hast done it in the Face of the Adversary and hast not been afraid And Blessed be the King into whose Heart God hath put it to Frown upon the Gainsayers and albeit they were gathered together against thee he hath seattered them and hath sent them away discouraged  Neither do I flatter thee with my Lips for Friends are not Guilty of such things and it would be in me a great Iniquity but I speak to thee in Sincerity and in Truth and my Thoughts are moved to utter the Words of my Mouth for verily thou hast dethroned and pulled down that Man of Sin the  Son of Perdition  which  has Exalted himself  thou hast valintly Encountred the Tribe of ungodly Priests who have by an  Injurious Usage of the Lord's People for many Years usurped the Authority of King Jesus and have exercised Dominion over the Souls who they have had committed by Men unto their Charge these they have Tyrannized over and have Cruelly Persecuted under pretence of Authority from Jesus albeit Jesus the true King and only Head of all true Believers as thou hast well said hath given no such Authority unto them  Now concerning Ministers I will tell thee what Friends do surely Receive and Believe and I will not give thee my own words but the words of the said Declaration of  Truth's Principles  mention'd before to wit  "Such Ministers as are made by God who are sanctified by his Word and Power who have freely received perfect Gifts from God and so by the Spirit and Power of God are sent forth into the World to turn the People from Darkness to Light and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God who freely Minister unto others without coveting any Man's Gold or Silver or Apparel not seeking theirs but them Warning every Man and teaching every Man in all Wisdom that they might present every Man perfect in Christ Jesus such as minister from the Spirit and have the Word of God abiding in them who are never unprovided but at all times and  seasons and in all places do speak and declare the Truth as they are moved and instructed and as the Spirit of Truth doth give them utterance Such Ministers we own and have in great esteem"  This we surely do Believe  Benjamin  and thou hast done worthily in concurring with us and in that thou hast taken away from those who call themselves  Ministers  all that Power and pretended Authority which they assume and which we say they usurp contrary to the Nature of the Office of a Minister which we also Declare to be only to Teach and Instruct not to Terrify and Affright the People of the Lord and herein we know that altho' thou wilt offend them and they will shew great Wrath against thee therefore yet  I say  we know thou hast spoken the Truth against them and I concur with thee therein nay I acknowledge thee and own thee therein because thou hast concurred with us in the Truth not doubting but thou wilt be farther inlightned in the Lord's due time to joyn with Friends in all the words of Truth which we Profess  I must farther say in thy behalf Friend  Benjamin  that thou hast spoken Excellent words of Wisdom in defiance of the Men of high Notions who are of the Tribe who thou didst belong to in former time for thou hast taken the People out of their hands and hast  set them free from the mock Terrors of Vain Men such as they call the Artillery of the Church which we that know the ways of Truth are acquainted with the Deceitfulness of and as I Glory in thy Words thereupon I shall repeat them in thy Praise as followeth to wit  "Not the least Tittle of Salvation or Damnation depends upon the Will of weak Men but all upon God and your selves Humane Benedictions Humane Absolutions Humane Denunciations Humane Excommunications have nothing to do with the Favour or Anger of God But are Humane Engins permitted to work  like other Evils  by Providence"  These are Excellent Things spoken with Wisdom and thou shalt have due Praise of the same Likewise hast thou Batter'd down the strong Holds of Satan in thy Words on the same Subject  "In all your  Religious Concerns  that effect your Eternal Salvation and your  Title  to  God's Favour  your  Rule  is plain and evident  Christ  is your sole Lawgiver and your sole Judge as to those Points The  Papists  may  Excommunicate  the  Protestant Non jurors  The  Nonjurors  may  Excommunicate the HighChurchMen  as well as all other  British Protestants  who pray for King  GEORGE  These again may  Excommunicate Ʋnchurch Ʋnchristian  those whose  ChurchGovernment  or  Worship  differ from their own and  these  again may Exercise the same  Spiritual Discipline  wherever their  Terrors  can extend themselves They may thus scatter  Damnation  about Playing one would think as the  Man  in the  Proverbs  with  Firebrands  and  Death  and saying  Are we not in Sport  and they may every one Flatter  themselves  that this  Power of the Keys  shuts out from the  Catholick Church  here and from the  Kingdom  of  Heaven  hereafter But it is in truth only from  themselves  that they can  Excommunicate  And this is very often their own  Crime  and their own  Loss  but  Christ  himself and his  Apostles  have plainly told you  what  it is and  what  alone that shall cut you off from  him  and Declared a Curse upon  all  who  Preach any other Gospel  and consequently who add any thing as absolutely necessary to his Favour which he hath not made so"  To these Truths of thine such I call them as thou hast been honoured to speak them first among Men I bear my Testimony and the good People the People of the Lord despised by Men of whom I am the meanest have born their Testimony many Years ago I say with thee that the boasted  Terms which those Men make wicked use of such as  Regular  and  uninterrupted Successions Authoritative Benedictions Excommunications Absolutions  c are  Vain Words  mere  Terrors of Men  not the Terrors of the Lord  Niceties  and  Trifles  And therefore it is that we disown the whole Tenor and Substance of the Canons and Institutions of that which they Prophanely as I doubt not thou wilt in time be led by these Lights to do also I Despise and Contemn all the pretended Authority of that which they weakly and impertinently call a Power derived from  Christ  and his  Apostles  I know no Ministers but such as is before described as for  such as are brought up at Schools and Colleges and so made Ministers by the will of Man who have not freely received perfect Gifts from God for perfecting of the Saints but denies  Perfection  and so denies the Ministers Work neither do minister freely but seek for Gain from their Quarters and will not Preach without a price who are not sanctified by the Word of God but plead for a continuance in Sin while People walk upon the Earth Such as Minister from the Letter and not from the Spirit who cannot Preach except they have time to Study and so by their industry provide themselves and are not provided of the Lord such a Ministry is of Works and not the Free Gift from God such cannot profit People but lead them captive  in an empty and dead Form  always hearing but never able to come to the true Knowledge of God  Such called Ministers we do deny and turn from them and testifie against them as the holy men of God formerly did  I doubt not Friend  Benjamin  but thy Words tend to bring thee to the same Just Contempt that I have entertained and that Friends most righteously do entertain of these  uncalled  Priests and that in the mean time thou wilt by thy  sober  and weighty Speeches bring all that wicked Hierarchy which those Priests so violently contend for into Contempt among the People  I am therefore moved to bear my Testimony with thee against them forasmuch as they usurping high Dignity and Authority have erected a Kingdom which they say is the Kingdom of Jesus howbeit as I verily think it is a Kingdom of this World forasmuch as they exercise Jurisdictions which be of this World therein and have taken to themselves Powers which be of themselves which nevertheless they take upon them to say are descended to them and by the notions and pretences of a Succession of those Powers they assume a Right to Exercise those Powers over the Consciences of Men which Friends say they have no Right to do And furthermore we say and believe That whereas they Exercise the Power and  Authority which alone belongs to King  Jesus  the King and sole Chief of his faithful Followers they therefore erect their own Kingdom not the Kingdom of King  Jesus  and exercise the Authority and Power which is his only as their own  I rejoice  Benjamin  that thou hast published true Doctrine and hast given thy testimony with us to the Truth which we on so good and solid Foundations have receiv'd and I question not but thou wilt be assisted by the Spirit of Truth to pull down and overthrow the whole Power Hierarchy and Constitution of that People who call themselves  The Church  verily they are Usurpers of the Kingdom and Throne of King  Jesus  and thou shalt be a Champion of the Truth in that thou shalt overthrow those Ecclesiastick  Principalities  and  Powers  which are not of God and shalt establish true Religion in that mighty Principle of Heavenly Light in which it is only to be found  This is that inward Revelation which thou hast been obliged to bear thy Testimony unto  viz  That Light  which perswades  the Minds of Men and whereby every step of Reformation which hath been made in the World hath been justified and which as thou sayest well is all the Account which Protestants can give for their being reform'd from the People call'd  Papists  And doubtless thou hast by the same Arguments justified all those the People of the Lord who  being perswaded  in themselves of their being guided by Heavenly Light have separated and withdrawn from these Usurpations of which thou hast spoken so worthily  And what remains beloved Friend  Benjamin  but that thou shouldst according as thou hast worthily begun and according to the Light which shineth in thy Mind  separate thy self from  these Usurpers of unrighteous Authority and joining thy self with  the Friends  to Truth shouldst bear thy Testimony against all Ungodliness for verily  Benjamin  thou canst not but see and abhor the Doctrine which these Men teach saying We are the Church and Power is with us which thou knowest is false and is not of God and that the Power which they use is not of God but is the Power of Men tending to ungodly Dominion and Usurpation such as is that of the Pope of  Rome  which nevertheless they have disowned while they yet practice  For verily  Benjamin  it seemeth to me that thou who hast received such Light and hast acknowledged the Truths which are directly contrary to these Men canst not any longer continue among them or wear those prophane Ensigns of Idolatry whereby thou  art distinguished from other Men even in a manner which thou thy self knowest is not appointed by King  Jesus  For verily  Benjamin  the Robes of Distinction which thou wearest and wherewith thou art honoured among Men are the Ensigns of that usurp'd Power which thou hast so worthily condemned and thou canst not longer abide among those who thou knowest are the Enemies to the Light which thou hast receiv'd and who walk contrary to the Doctrine which thou hast taught and which we the Lord's People have so many Years ago receiv'd  Wherefore I am mov'd to advertise thee in behalf of the Truth that thou shouldst not delay any longer joining thy self unto the Lord's People whose Cause thou hast already so worthily pleaded For why shouldst thou not cause thy Life and thy Doctrine to conform unto each other And why shouldst thou decline to profess openly thy adherence to the Lord's People whilst thou dost not decline to teach the Principles which they believe and which they have received from the beginning  It is true  Benjamin  the mean and humble Station of those who be Teachers and Ministers of the Lord among us may not be agreeable to thy present Temper who art exalted to be great among Men but whereas thou knowest that the Kingdom of  Jesus  is not of this World and that likewise  his Rewards are not of this World  as thou hast most worthily taught so  Benjamin  how shouldst thou not reject the Honours given by Men which are the Rewards issuing from that usurped Power which is not according to the Laws of  his Kingdom  These sincerely according to thy own Rules are not of God neither canst thou who art now enlightned from a higher Spirit submit to be deck'd with their Ornaments but shouldst cast them off like as Christians in Primitive Times refused to be deck'd with the  Garlands  and  Vestments  of Idolatrous Priests and like as those People who are called  Protestants  refuse and detest the Habiliments and Vestments Titles Dignities and Distinctions of the Popish Priests choosing to be called by the truly venerable Name of  Ministers of Christ  rather than by the Titles of  Popes Cardinals Abbots Monks Friers  and the like  Forasmuch then as the Usurpers of the Power and Authority of  King Jesus  have manifestly invaded his Crown and Judicatory also as thou hast said and have set up Marks of their usurp'd Authority  to wit  their Antichristian  Excommunications Absolutions Exorcisms  and other profane Practices and have likewise given Honours which our Lord and only Soveraign  Jesus  Christ  never gave it seemeth unto me that thou  Benjamin  who hast so manfully dethroned their Power and Authority and hast exposed their Usurpation to such Contempt or at least hast contemned it in thy Heart and with the Words of thy Mouth  I say  it seemeth unto me that thou canst not receive the Honours given by that usurped Authority without some Breach upon the aforesaid Declaration of thy Principles and acting therein contrary to the Light which is within thee  Furthermore  Benjamin  I admonish thee to consider that thou canst not abide in the Truth which thou hast now taught in thy Speaking Place and published with boldness in Printed Papers unless thou  comest out  from among that sort of People of whom thou art said now to be a Ruler  forasmuch  as thou hast declared them to be Workers of Iniquity and Sons of  Belial  Thy Conscience therefore will not suffer thee to be called any longer by their Name neither canst thou be found any longer to own and join thy self unto them Canst thou  Benjamin  be joined unto Usurpers of the Authority of thy Master and King Canst thou share his Power whom thou hast so loudly declared to be the  sole Lawgiver  and  Governour  of his Kingdom Do not these Men continue their Usurpations Do they not continue to  claim that Authority which  as thou hast said  appertains only to Christ the King And thou knowest  Benjamin  they will continue to claim the same and to exercise it as if it was granted unto them albeit thou knowest that it is not Wherefore O Man remove thy self speedily from these Men yea I know thou wilt remove thy self from them For why shouldst thou be found at last in the company of those Men whom thou hast filled with Contempt  saying  They are Enemies to the Kingdom of  Jesus  in the World  Verily  Benjamin  thou hast done well in that thou hast openly declared the Iniquity of those who have armed themselves with unlawful Power and have exercised Tyranny over their Brethren  saying  Ye must join with us otherwise ye shall go to Prison or otherwise you shall have no Honour or Part or Lot among us whereas King  Jesus  never left any such Commandment But it remaineth as a Difficulty or Doubt unto us who are Friends how thou canst O  Benjamin  lay a Confederacy with these Men Art not thou therein an Usurper also with them of the Power and Authority of thy only Lord and King and that in a much grosser manner than they Verily  Benjamin  if thou come not out from among them thou wilt give occasion  to wicked Men to say of thee that thou hast said that in thy Teaching Office which thou wilt not put in practice in thy own Person and they will speak evil words of thee  saying  Thou teachest Men to do what thou shunnest to do thy self and that thou shunnest not those things which thou teachest others to shun and avoid Moreover  Benjamin  Art thou not even at this time and after the similitude of thine own words according to thy own Doctrine an Usurper of the Authority of  King Jesus  in that thou continuest to exercise that same Power of which thou hast said that  King Jesus  gave no such Power unto Men  to wit  that profane unlawful Power which those whom Men call Bishops generally exercise over their Brethren oppressing the Lord's People in their ungodly Courts Dost thou not preside in thy usurped Judicature exercising that Power there which thou hast said  the Lord hath not given thee a Right to exercise  And dost thou not there make use of those things which thou hast owned to be  Trifles  and  Nullities  to wit  Excommunications Absolutions  and such like things I say Dost thou not suffer these things to be done in thy Name to the Subjects of thy Lord in those Seats of Evil Men called Ecclesiastick Courts And how canst thou do this after thou hast so plainly told us that this  is to make thy self King in the stead of thy King Jesus Nay Friend  Benjamin  in this thou hast not done well  forasmuch also  as thou hast sinned herein against the Light that is in thee and hast caused thy Feet to tread aside out of the Path of Truth which thou hast chalked out for others that they might walk therein But I trust that thou wilt be guided by the good Spirit and by the light of Truth shining in thy Soul and then thou wilt be sure to come away and remove from the Tents of wickedness  Wherefore Friend  Benjamin  as I know that the Truth hath been spoken by thee I warn thee for thy good that thou come out speedily from among them lay down thy painted Vestments and prophane Trinkets the Ensigns of that Usurpation upon thy Lord and Master's Kingdom which thou hast so faithfully born thy Testimony against  I say  I exhort thee to lay them down speedily and come out from among them forthwith  joyning thy self unto us  whose Principles thou hast acknowledged So shall thy Life and Doctrine be Uniform and thou shalt be sure to deserve that Blessing which attends those who are not ashamed to Practice the things which they Profess  Likewise  Benjamin  this will enable thee to overcome the Gainsayers for behold  they do already upbraid thee herewith and verily the Man called  Andrew Snape  hath spoken unto thee Words of scorning with boldness in a Book which he stileth a Letter written unto thee and in the Twenty and Fifth Page thereof that  if the Case be as thou hast said it is the  Men called Parsons  have nothing more to do but to throw up their Orders since their Church hath no need of them and since they not only do no Service but are Guilty of a Criminal Ʋsurpation  Likewise hath the same  Andrew Snape  said unto thee in his said Book and in the Thirty and Sixth Page thereof these words  to wit  That he doth not see  how upon these Principles thou canst take thy place in the Provincial Sanhedrim of the Priests  or how  thou canst require Subscriptions or Declarations of those of the Sons of the Prophets whom thou dost admit to the Priesthood among thy People  or how  thou canst Exercise almost any Act of Episcopal Jurisdiction  Now verily  Benjamin  albeit this same  Andrew Snape  is a Man by his Profession in an evil way and such as I allow not to be according to the Truth yet nevertheless herein hath he spoken unto thee words which thou shouldest consider well of for that they are of weight unto thee  to wit  That thou shouldst separate thy self from Evildoers whose ways thou knowest to be  Wrong and that whereas thou hast condemned them for Usurpation and Invasion of the Kingdom of  King Jesus  thou shouldest not at the same time continue among them or sit in thy Seat in their Assemblies  Moreover it seemeth unto me  Benjamin  that whereas thou hast replied to  Andrew Snape  in harsh Words saying That he hath evil entreated thee and hath written bitter things against thee and things which savour not of Truth yet nevertheless I perceive that thou hast not said one word unto him to Gainsay what he hath told thee concerning thy coming out from among them or that thou canst not by thy own Principles take thy Seat in the Assembly of thy Priests wherefore I rejoice in thy behalf nothing doubting but that thou wilt come and join thy self with the Lord's People who are Friends unto the Truth and unto all that thou hast said of the Usurpation of Men and as I have already given thee to understand have many Years received the Truths which thou hast Preached at this day  Neither let it grieve thee Friend  Benjamin  that thou shalt relinquish the things which Men call Honours and Greatness and shalt lose thereby the Advantages and Profits which thou dost now receive forasmuch as thou knowest that the Rewards of the Kingdom  of Jesus  are  not of this World  and if the Rewards of this World are the Sanctions of the Kingdom whereof thou hast spoken then it is not of  Jesus  So that thou shalt only relinquish the Rewards of this World and shalt seek the Rewards of that Kingdom which is not of this World  These things being so naturally drawn from thy own words I trust thou wilt not Hesitate thereat but wilt accept of my wholesome Advice and shew thy self not to be ashamed of the practising those things whereof thou hast testify'd  saying  That they are True  Neither canst thou Friend  Benjamin  be in danger of joyning with any other People than those whose Profession I have here invited thee to since there are not any who have received the Truths which thou hast Preached in their full Degrees so as the People who in contempt are called  Quakers  with whom as I have shewed thou hast perfectly conformed thy self to the Honour of thy Judgment and of the divine Light shewing forth in thee  As for those People called  Presbyterians  thou canst by no means joyn thy self unto them seeing they have declared themselves in Terms greatly opposite to thy Doctrines saying That Men have Power to make Laws binding the Consciences of others and that  Rewards and Punishments of this World appertain to Humane Authority exercised by such as they call a Succession of Officers These their Opinions are not according to Truth as Friends have received it neither are they like unto those Truths which thou hast Preached And therefore we see that questionless thou wilt avoid also the Erroneous Opinions of Persecuting  Presbyterians  and wilt joyn thy self unto us and this I speak unto thee with the more certainty  forasmuch  as Blessed by the Lord thou art already come beyond the corrupt Tenets of those People Moreover beloved Friend  Benjamin  I make known unto thee that the said  Presbyterians  are equally guilty of those things which the People of the Lord abhor  to wit  The pretences to a Power which as thou saidst well  Jesus  the King of all those who are led by the light of the Truth never delegated to them and this they not only give to their Followers but make Laws of their own  I say  Humane Laws and Sanctions of Laws such as Rewards and Punishments for enforcing others to comply therewith to wit That they admit none to be Teachers among them or to Preach and Prophesy unto the People unless they profess to believe and to receive certain Points which they call  prophanely  Articles of Faith  wherein these wicked usurpations of Power are openly declared by them saying  "That the Lord Jesus as King and Head of his Church hath therein appointed a Government in the hand of ChurchOfficers distinct from the Civil Magistrate"  "That to these Officers the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed by Vertue whereof they have Power respectively to Retain and Remit Sins to shut that Kingdom against the Impenitent both by the Word and Censures and to open it unto penitent Sinners by the Ministry of the Gospel and by Absolution from Censures as occasion shall require"  "That these Church Censures are necessary  c  for preventing the Wrath of God which might fall upon the Church if they should suffer the Seal of the Covenant to be prophaned by Notorious and Obstinate Offenders"  These things thou knowest  Benjamin  are contrary to the Doctrines and Positions which thou hast so openly avowed being no less than Invasions and manifest Usurpations of the Kingdom and Authority of King Jesus and in themselves  Nullities  and  Trifles  Yet these things and in these Words thou wilt find in those  Heads of Belief  which these ungodly  Presbyterians  call the Confession  of their Faith  Article  the XXX Howbeit Blessed art thou O  Benjamin  in that thou hast born thy Testimony against these also Wherefore I know that leaving behind thee all these wicked and erroneous Opinions and bearing witness to the Truth thou wilt at length joyn thy self unto us and I rejoice over thee in this that thou art inlightned to know the Truth Testifying that I embrace thee with Affection in the Lord  Friend  Timothy  Greeteth thee in like manner as also  James  the Aged a Lover of those who forsake the Errors of the Wicked In a word all Friends Greet and speak well of thee  Fare thee well  FINIS
