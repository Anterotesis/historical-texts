which ought to be enjoyed only by the Great has been by the dd troublesome plebeian scoundrels who founded in freedom the basis of this hateful Constitution so clearly transmitted down to their posterity that ev'n with the most u and c K that ever lived and no want of Ml tools ready enough to support every step to despotismYet one d obstinate fellow has had address enough in spite of persecution to keep the peoples eyes open and from my very first appearance on the Theatre of Politics to counteract every plot I can formHa but here comes  Grapnel    enter Grap  Your Gs most

GRAP  Why'faith my Lord they go on to your wish and their numbers rather increase than diminish  BOTCH  So much the betterMilitary force the very soul of Government is so fettered in this dd land of freedom that there's no such thing as using it until the terror of every cowardly peace officer obliges them to cry for it and then we can employ it with some degree of plausibility  Grapnel  I have contriv'd it so that none but sneaking fools shall on that occasion appear in opposition to the  Watcherites  By which means the mobility may be induced to proceed to such enormities that the blockheads who are to deal with them will to protect themselves call loudly for military aid and thereby furnish us with an excellent pretext to govern by that PowerThis my Lord is a crisis which

reproachI hear  Almagnia  Enter  ALMAGNIA  ALM  My Lord 'tis past all bearingwas ever a person in my exalted station suffered to be so daringly and openly insulted by a rabble ofrascally slaves  BOTCH  Alas Madam they are not slavesthat's what I want to bring 'em toMay I but accomplish thatyour vengeance should be amply gratifiedBut what's the mattertell me thou dear empress of my heartdoes any thing new distress you  ALM  See here another vile scrawl found pasted near the pe ge this morningWhat are all the guards blind where are their eyes what have they their arms and their pay for I conjure you my Lord to enquire into this matter find out who were upon guardI shall insist that they be punishedI never desire to see any but the d regiment mount upon the  BOTCH  Madamthat's what cannot besuch distinctions would provoke our best friends the ay to the same disaffection which governs the multitudeand then indeed the event might be fatal to both you and me  ALM  Wellwell my

 "The  is a foolhis  a whoreBotch is a rogueWe need say no more"  BOTCH  Such insolence is indeed distracting  ALM  Yes my Lordsuch insolence is distractingand to suffer itnot much to the honour of a man for whom I have so dearly purchased so much powerBy heav'ns 'tis want of spirit  BOTCH  Madamyou wrong meWhat man dare doI dareBut the constitution of this dd country so little understood by either you or me is so pregnant with obstacles to arbitrary gt That while one  Watcher  stands in our way the difficulties are almost insuperable  ALM  Very fine indeedAfter having spent the very best of my youth to aggrandize and to make you happyI must at length be told that the acd cn of this country condemns me to bear hourly insults unnoticed and confinement from every sort of pleasure butthose of my bed chamberOf what importance then my Lord has been the persecution and imprisonment of the so much dreaded  Watcher  Had it not been better to have purchased him also at any price  BOTCH  Madam you know as little of  Watcher  as you do of the E cnhe is incorruptibleFor what good purpose do you think it was that I bestowed so much pains to soften and reclaim the most obdurate enemy we hadThe so popular  Chatwell  Why madamall that was with a view to trapan  WatcherChatwell  had his priceI found it outI left him and his contentious ally Lord  Taunter  to divide the nations spoils between 'emandall to silence this dd  Watcher  whom I thought was so inviolably attached to their interests that he would lead just as they pleasedbut he's an unfathomable fellowThe PEOPLE are his Kand HE is THEIRSthere's no separating their interestsNor do I see a possibility of purchasing  Watcher  's servicesBut ata pricewhich no mr will ever part withthat isto yield up all the power and wealth of ct supporters and ct prs to be divided amongst the multitude that they forsooth may enjoy the conveniencies of life with no less satisfaction than the best of usperdition seize such Liberty  ALM  Then my LordI find there's no hope leftI wish I was any where out of this vile country  BOTCH  A moment's patience madamI have yet some cards to playfor  Chatwell  and  Taunter  when they had you know the whole km at their disposal differed between themselves as I rightly judged about the dividing of itI threw them the bait on purposethey tug'd and tug'd at each end of it until  Chatwell  finding what every body had seen before that the avidity of  Taunter  was insatiable then invited others less gormandizers to partake of the feast  and by one clever jirk he pulled the bait entirely out of  Taunter  's mawhe next gilded a a pill for  PrattlePrattle  swallowed itand the edge of his patriotic zeal was blunted  Watcher  perceiving that the capital pillars of his grand structure were thus shaken and that  Taunter  only was left unsatisfied bethought him next to rear an edifice on a broader bottom to be founded in greater solidity and to require fewer ornamentsHe applies himself to the publicendeavours as the most interested to open their eyes and to speak truth he has laboured so successfully that the Question now isWhether all must yield to WATCHER and LIBERTYor by force and despotism endeavour to  chastise  both  ALM  And do you make a question of thathave you not  Watcher  already tied up Are not the js of our side and have you not all the my force of the nn at your command  BOTCH  True madam  Watcher  is confined but this confinement is rather form than realityAnd if he was of that seditious spirit that we attribute to him he has friends enough at his nod to shake the pillars not of his pn only but the pe tooAnd it is from some violent attempt of that sort that my best hopes are at present foundedBut I fear he has too much penetration for us allfor altho' he sustains the spirit of the multitude he artfully restrains their impetuosityAs for the jsI hope they lean to our side but the sagacity of  Mansupple  is so guarded that he'll do nothing rashlythe best services he will do for us must have at least the countenance of lThe my are no doubt at our devotion but even with respect to them I am under some difficultiesthere's Lord  Shelter  rides  restyhe is yet too young in ml practicesnay I'm afraid the projects we must now carry through are somewhat repugnant to his notions of politicsI'm afraid he's either too honest or too timoroushe feels too warmly for the peopleand altho' he never was in the cabal with  Watcher  yet he rather seems to disapprove of rigid measuresin one word I am deceived in himI do not like himand yet when force is necessary I would wish to have his sanction  Enter a  SERVANT  SERV  My Lordan officer  Ex  Almagnia  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  My Lordall is in an uproarnothing to be heard from one end of the city

does  Watcher  behave  OFFICER  Why my Lord he seldom appears and when he does come to the window the acclamations are so loud that he can't be heard himselfOne of his dd adherents told me that in the midst of their uproar a servant of  Watcher  's mingled with the mob they bore the servant on their shouldersSwore that maugre all power on earth they would have him out And that if he would not come to the window to satisfy them that he was well and wellusedthey would instantly knock down every thing before them and make their way to his apartmentThe servant told them he would speak to them and had twice  attempted it but that their clamour was so noisy he could not be heardMy Lord it will surprise you but 'tis true the word of command for silence was given out and in a trice all was as still as a bagnio at middayThe servant returned  Watcher  came to his window and harrangued the people upon the impropriety of their assembling in such numbers neglecting their business and their families to do him more harm than goodtold them his confinement was by appointment of law that the same law would soon relieve him and that he would not for a kingdom enjoy one hour of freedom that was contrary to lawHe prayed them to dismissand promised that should any illegal steps be pursued to punish him or injure them he would then be glad of and call for their assistance but at present he had no complaints  BOTCH  Curse his discretion  OFFI  But all would not do my Lordhe had no sooner finished and pulled down his window than the shouting grew louderhis enemies were all ddand swearing

these are shameful and terrible doingsSee what all this patriotism of  Watchers  brings upon us  BLUNT  Friend  Honesty  thou art certainly madAll this patriotism of  Watchers  What in the name of justiceDo you blame  Watcher  HON  No I do not blame  Watcher  as the actual transgressor but as the original cause for had he kept himself quiet and given no countenance to the mob perhaps his past offences might have been forgotten the gt might have overlookt him then there would have been no canvassing no caballing nor no riots  BLUNT  Friend  Honesty  you are not yet well acquainted with the true spirit and character of  Jack Watcher  Some others of your more pusilanimous  liberty boasters  would as you say have kissed the rod long before nowBut  Jack  is not that manhe has once fairly engaged to be  liberty  's and the  people  's championAnd to expose to the just censure of the public those ml ss who would sacrifice both to the lust of their own temporary emolumenthe has resolution and he has honestyAnd should arbitrary measures so far prevail against him as to bring him even under sentence of deathWhilst the people will adhere to him and until he obtains for them the end of his noble pursuit he would go to that death sooner than owe his life to ml favour  HON  Well well but to what end does he seduce the people to neglect their business and to make all this rout and noise so much to the prejudice of themselves and neglect of their families I still say that he is indirectly the cause of this day's slaughter  BLUNT  Watcher  does by no means either seduce or inflame themThey are sensible that it is on account of his firm attachment to them and to the just influence he has got amongst them that the resentment of an so keenly persecutes him they justly think if they were to leave him to lie neglected in a prison where he's confined for their sakes it would be the height of ingratitudeThis leads numbers of them successively to shew their personal gratitude by which they imagine they keep up his spiritsThis is poison to his persecutorsThey make a parade of gs cs cSuch parades always gather abundance of idlers and the indifferent and the interested mingling together look like a concourse of people and are howsoever quiet branded with the name of mobThe scheme of gt is to deter every body from so much as looking at himIn hopes by procrastinating his trial as they do from day to day that the people will at length be tired out and so desert himBut to blame him with any fatal consequences is just as reasonable as it would be to blame meIf I sent out a ship to purchase wealth to the nation and if by the mismanagement of the master or pilot the ship should be lostthe loss of that ship's crew may I say be as justly imputed to me as the murders of this day can be imputed to honest  Jack Watcher  HON  Well  Blunt  but what security have the people or you in your minds supposing that  Watcher  was to get the better of his enemies  what security have you I say that he would more than others before him exert unchangeably all his masterly faculties for the public weal  BLUNT  Every earthly security that can be promised upon incorruptibilitya clear headand an honest heart  HON  Pray what mighty proofs has he given of being incorruptible  BLUNT  Proofs in such a case cannot be positive because corruption seldom admits of evidenceBut never was any case supported by so strong presumptive proofDuring his service in pt his vigilance and activity could not escape the notice of the msWe all know that many with not the half of his talents were bought off at a very high price and his continuing so long unplaced and unpensioned is a convincing testimony to me that he was not to be purchasedIn the next place when through him such a wound was given to the  native liberty of E  can you suppose that any  son of corruption  would have in defence of it undergone ignominious trials and suffered imprisonment when doubtless he could have avoided both by letting the stab which  liberty  had sustained pass unnoticed Would not the my think you have paid him a very high price rather than have submitted to the disgrace he brought upon them and their emissaries and yet did he not as advocate for the  public  peril his freedom and fortune rather than yield one inch of  theirs  HON  Why  Blunt  these are strong presumptions I confess but how will you justify that clearness of head and goodness of heart you ascribe to him when you consider the censure of pt  and the vs of a j standing against him for sedition and impiety  BLUNT  As for the seditious part of it  Honesty  has too much good sense not to grant me that the speeches put into the mouths of the best of ks by wicked mrs have before  Watcher's  time been as freely handled and not a word said about itAs to the accusation of impietyI am sorry he is liable to the imputationBut I will no more admit that he was guilty of a publication in that case than if you was to shew me a witty poem however wild it might be of which I should wish for a copy and you should consent to let me take one on condition that I would furnish you with two or threeThe perusal of free thoughts on religious subjects is only dangerous to the morals of mankind when they fall into the hands of weak heads incapable of distinguishing between right and wrongWhen they come into the hands of men of sense they will be able to discover and expose their errors and thereby do rather service than harm to the truthAnd as it is impossible to conceive that ever the piece in question was designed for the public eye as I can't help thinking that a most absurd verdict which pronounced it to be a publication and by that means subjected the  undesigning copier  to the punishment due to a criminal publisher  HON  Upon my word  Blunt  thou mak'st no bad advocate for thy friend  Jack Watcher  BLUNT  My friend d'ye call him'Faith he's too keen a fellow to be a friend to  Blunt  any farther than as being the friend of the  public  he's every man's friend and as such he shall always have  Blunt  's best wishes Nay neighbour I'll fairly tell you that I'm determined to stand by him at the peril of all I'm worth  HON  Give me thy fist  Blunt  for by my soul  Honesty  will go hand in hand with theeI'll tell thee  Blunt  It is now no trifling questionI don't at present look upon it as a simple contention between  Watcher  and the myI consider it as war openly declared between  Liberty  and  arbitrary Power  At no juncture have the people so unanimously and avowedly distinguished themselves in the cause of Freedom and PatriotismAnd if it should be in the power of prerogative and despotism to render their endeavours upon this occasion ineffectual then may every one of us be next employed to rivet his neighbour's chainsAlong then friend  Blunt  let's go to the Duke's Head and quaff one sober bottleto  Liberty  to  Watcher  and to every true friend of our good kind and freeconstitution  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to Covent Garden  Enter  BLUNT JENNY  following  JEN  Hist histMr  Blunt  one word  BLUNT  What d'ye want ye jade get

friends with whom I really can enjoy an hour happen to be out o'the way you would pity me if you knew how distrest I amI have hungry as I am shun'd half a dozen opportunities this same evening of feasting and carousingbut to go amidst such debauchery and rioting as yet my stomach rises against  BLUNT  Well JENNYI do pity theeI must give thee a bit of supperbut tell me how came you to fall out

coolmutual indifference ensuedWhen my dear undoer came to townI long'd to repeat the act of my ruinIn fine without the least anger we parted just as decently as we met  BLUNT  Why i'faith JENNY thou art as ill calculated for a wanton as any of thy profession I ever knew  JEN  Dear  Blunt  don't for love's sake call it a profession those who make a profession of ithave the power or art which you will to please every body alikeThat I can't doI have too quick sensations and too much honesty to be a whoreI should for all the world make just such another whore as your friend  Jack Watcher  would make a courtierHe would like very well to enjoy all the pleasures luxury and gaiety of a court but he has too much honesty to purchase them by flattery and dissimulation  BLUNT  Well said JENNYThen

That's an E Mr  Blunt  I never sawbut if it contained any thing to the prejudice of women I'll be sworn it was none of  Jack Watchers  and as to its impietyif he had been tried by the judge before

in five minutes than all the ml force of the kingdom could have effected in a week  BLUNT  Why I'll tell thee  Honesty  I say nothing but what are in reality the sentiments of  Watcher  himselfIn the beginning of his endeavours herepopular appearances were necessary for  him to supply the defections of those affected patriots who had formerly flattered him with their eternal protectionHe found after he had risked all and spent all in pursuit of the very schemes they had concerted with him that they had fallen off and become so lukewarm that unless he should be able to inspirit the public with a just sense of his and their own oppressions he must fall a sacrifice to real merithe therefore did not at first discourage their cabals but as no man is more anxious than he to preserve order and harmony in the community and knowing very well the dangerous effects of popular fury he has laboured with as much zeal to moderate their resentments as he nobly intends to employ for the redress of their grievances  HON  But pray tell me  Blunt  have his lately so great and powerful friends actually abandoned him  BLUNT  Not entirely abandoned himthat's what for their own sakes at least for the sake of that popularity on which they would still fain plume themselves they dare hardly doThey continue I believe to contribute towards his expencebut for his noble and spirited measures they leave him to struggle through them the best way he canThey will not consent I imagine that he be too rigorously handled but they will as little concur with him in bringing to justice those tools of An who have disgraced and plundered the nation to aggrandize themselves and to crush the efforts of true patriotism  HON  By my soul  Blunt  I always feared it would be soAnd yet who could have thought itWho for example to have heard the patriotic declamations of an orator  Chatwell  while a crcould have believed he would ever  submit to that degenerated inactivity in which they now rock him to sleep  BLUNT  Chatwell  's degeneracy does by no means surprize me I have ever lookt upon him to be the vainest of all menhis best hopes were from the beginning founded in the people's applause that he courted that he obtained and he has made a good account of itThe amazing success which crown'd his an made him the idol of the people who would not see how greedily he adorned himself with ornaments of which he often spoiled the real purchaser no man in these days dared to contradict him and he therefore assumed every glory to himself  HON  Why  Blunt  all that's but too truenor did I begrudge him at that time any honour  he graspt atI regarded him as the saviour of a sinking state and thought the more honour he acquired the more he should have it in his power to distribute justice  BLUNT  Yes justicewhat justice pray did he attain for the honest qI forgot his namebut who from pure publick spiritednessthrew himself out of a thriving trading companyPlan'd the attempt upon  Sl  spent every shilling he had industriously gained that he might convince the My of his sincerityassisted or at least directed in the operations which conquered itcame home big with the hopes of grateful acknowledgments from so patriotic an AnThese hopes not founded on imagination only but in written holograph assurances under the hand of the great patriot himselfand did not  Chatwell  nevertheless not only assume to himself the whole merit of that scheme but would fain have retracted his promisesand because the honest q unschool'd in the  science of politicks would not belye himself and suffer the whole honour of the project to be ascribed solely to  Chatwell  did not  Chatwell  in place of rewarding neglect and insult himAnd as I'm well assured had it not been for the generosity and truly patriotick application of Lord  Shelter  the Sy who solicited and obtained a pension for the original contriver of that conquestthen in very deep distressthe resentment of  Chatwell  would have left the cheated q to have lamented in indigence the folly of a merchant having forsook trade to spend a fortune in the publick service  HON  I have indeed heard as muchand fartherthat although to demonstration there never was a better concerted planyetthat unless it had been countenanced and enforced by Lord  H  all the q's fervency never could have moved the spirit of An to have carried it into execution  BL  I believe that's truefor  H  was certainly the first who adopted it and as far as he had influence promoted it  H  is no bad manand I wish the execution of the dd g w had fallen to any other mr's share than his  HON  Wellbut pray tell me what did the q get by it at last  BL  Whyhe got a pensionI don't know how muchbut I'mtoldlittle more than sufficient to pay up the very debt he was obliged to contract during the time he was soliciting it  HON  Well  Blunt  and if  Chatwell  now that he is again in An does not exert himself to repair at least a fortune so sequester'd to the publick usemay  BL  Aymay the next fool that spends a shilling in such a service be hang'das well asbeggar'd  HON  But tell me  Blunt  might not the fate of the q have served as a beacon to your friend  Jack Watcher  BLUNT  Friend  Honesty  the case is extremely differentThe q for the service of his country had but one single object in viewupon the fate of that he was willing to peril his life and all he was worthbut it was still in the character of a merchantif his project failed he was undoneif it succeeded he hoped to avail himself by some preference in the commercial way  Watcher  's enthusiasm is of quite another forthe penetrates into the bowels of an he sees by what poison it has been infectedhe is anxious to purge itand will rather die than leave it unrestored to its primitive constitutionhe has abilities and perseveranceAnd while he breathes he will flatter himself with being upheld by honest menThat at length if not in the c at least in the s he may be the terror of evil doersAmenso be it  If patriots dauntlessfor their country bleed  Reward tho' latewill certainly succeed  Exeunt  SCENE  changes and discovers Lord  Botch  and Lord

and then the worst would have been a forfeiture of the bailBut how in equity can we accept the bail of  wilful murderers  after having rejected it in the case of ludicrous publications will be something so repugnant to common sense that every porter has judgment to reason upon the improprietyIn a word my Lord they must be triedand if condemnedyou may obtain a pardon for them  BOTCH  That

heinous sin  MANS  No master constable there is no more sin in the words  Watcher  and  Liberty  than there is common sense in the word  Constable  It is according as they are employed that they are useful or troublesome to the communityAnd I am afraid that you are as much mistaken in having brought these people before me as they are mistaken in neglecting their business to cry out  Watcher  and  Liberty    to  Jenny    and pray madam how comes a gentlewoman of your appearance to be amongst the rest  JENNY  For saying my Lord what I imagine your Lordship thinksThat this wiseacre of a constable wasa foolI was accidentally passing by saw these people in no other act of rioting than laughing and singing something about  Watcher  and  Liberty  and this sagacious gentleman having laid hold of

have the honour to be presented to your lordship  MANS  Pray Sir why is this gentlewoman brought here  CONS  Why my LordI think she's hanged by her own confessiondoes she not own that she called a civil magistrate a fool in the due execution of his office  MANS  My good friendIt is not possible in every case to suppress the truthI'm afraidwhen a constable acts foolishlyone may call him a foolwithout incurring the censure of the lawlet me advise you for your own sake to carry for the future such offenders before some of the acting j s don't trouble me with themAnd in  the mean time you
