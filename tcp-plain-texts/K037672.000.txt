 HECUBA A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  Rectius  Iliacum  carmen deducis in Actus  Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in Pallmall MDCCLXII Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TO THOMAS BARRETT  Esq  THE FOLLOWING TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS OBLIGED AND VERY AFFECTIONATE HUMBLE SERVANT The AUTHOR  Advertisement  IT may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader that the author has ventured to make Polydore a person of the Drama on the authority of Hyginus a Greek grammarian who tells us in one of his fables that Ilione by a feigned murder deceived Polymestor and preserved her brother's life  PROLOGUE  Written by Mr LLOYD  And spoken by Mr GARRICK  A Grecian bard two thousand years ago  Plan'd this sad fable of illustrious woe  Waken'd each soft emotion of the breast  And call'd forth tears that would not be supprest  Yet O ye mighty sirs of judgement chaste  Who lacking genius have a deal of taste  Can you forgive our modern ancient piece  Which brings no chorus tho' it comes from Greece  Kind social chorus which all humours meets  And sings and dances up and down the streets  Oh might true taste in these unclassic days  Revive the Grecian fashions with their plays  Then rais'd on stilts our player's would stalk and rage  And at three steps stride o'er a modern stage  Each gesture then would boast unusual charms  From lengthen'd legs stuff'd body sprawling arms  Your critic eye would then no pigmies see  But buskin's make a giant ev'n of  Me  No features then the poet's mind would trace  But one blank vizor blot out all the face  O glorious times when actors thus could strike  Expressive inexpressive all alike  Less change of face than in our Punch they saw  For Punch can roll his eyes and wag his jaw  With one set glare they mouth'd the rumbling verse  Our  Gog  and  Magog  look not half so fierce  Yet tho' depriv'd of instruments like these  Nature perhaps may find a way to please  Which wheresoe'er she glows with genuine flame  In  Greece  in  Rome  in  England  is the same  Of raillery then ye modern wits beware  Nor damn the Grecian poet for the player  Theirs was the skill with honest help of art  To win by just degrees the yielding heart  What if our Shakespear claims the magic throne  And in one instant makes us all his own  They differ only in the point of view  For Shakespear's nature was their nature too  Dramatis Personae  MEN  ULYSSES  Mr DAVIES  ERIPHILUS  Mr HOLLAND  MELANTHUS  Mr HAVARD  TALTHYBIUS  Mr CASTLE  LYCUS  Mr ACKMAN  CRATANDER  Mr MOODY

ULYSSES  WHATwhen the peace the future fa  Greece  Hang on th' event does Nestor thus advise  Thou must mistake him herald  TALTHYBIUS  With due defere  He hears Ulysses' counsel yet compassion  Prompts him to listen to Pyrechmes' suit  And yield up Hecuba  ULYSSES  Compassionweakness  Meer womanish weakness call it nothing bett  I feel a crimson blush burn on my cheek  E'vn at the thought Was it for this dread I  We led our Argives to Scamander's banks  To toil ten tedious years was it for this  You crown'd those toils with conquest oh for pity  Send thy sage spirit to direct our councils  That veer as passion drives See where our sails  Stand bent at Chersonesus to transport  Us and our spoils to Greece and shall we leave  The noblest most important part behind  The queen of Troy and her young dangerous daughter  Because Pyrechmes bids What is Pyrechmes  That Greece in her full glory fears his frown  Greece has more cause to fear a future foe  Yes from releas'd Polyxena may spring  New Hectors arm'd to wreak revenge hereafter  And send our sons to people Pluto's realms  By force I must detain her or by fraud  For my own sake I must for on Ulysses  The shame the weakness want of policy  All fall upon Ulysses  TALTHYBIUS  Yet the queen's  Distressful state  ULYSSES  Talthybius do not think  That ten long years of bloodshed stop up here  The passages to pity No the groans  Of reverend wretched age the tears that gush  From the sad eyes of supplicating beauty  Wou'd melt my heart too at less dangerous times  But now back herald to the king inform him  Yet stay Have these ambassadors with Nestor  Held private conference  TALTHYBIUS  Young Eriphilus  Enter'd his tent at daybreak Till which time  With Iphitus alone has he confer'd  ULYSSES  That lowring leader of a Trojan troop  Just ripe for a revolt  TALTHYBIUS  He royal sir  The queen's chief oracle as for Melanthus  ULYSSES  Aye what of him what know'st thou of Melanthus  TALTHYBIUS  Nothing He shuns all converse and seems rapt  In melancholy musings  ULYSSES  Yes th' old man  Seems close and crafty bears himself a loof  Keeps his young charge as 'twere beneath his wing  I do not like that caution it means mischief  Else wherefore ventur'd not the youth alone  What needed this greybearded monitor  To help him pay the ransom Say to Nestor  I'll meet him at his tent  Exit Tal  My doubts were just  Danger doth lurk beneath the hoary locks  Of this Melanthus There's some secret plot  'Tis scarce engender'd yet and prudence bids  We crush the dang'rous birth Yes if the wizard  I've conjur'd up wave skilfully his wand  The princess shall be fetter'd with a charm  Faster than his fond efforts can undo  And for the queen why let the queen go free  It harms not us her barren womb no more  Shall teem with Trojan pests and such an act  May smooth the roughness of our enterprize  And calm Pyrechmes True we fear him not  Yet policy forbids us to despise  Ev'n a weak foe till we recruit our pow'rs  Thin'd by a ten years siege  OFFICER ULYSSES  OFFICER  At great Achilles' tomb Calchas dread sir  Awaits your royal will  Exit  ULYSSES  I follow thee  Aye now I will inspire that holy seer  With counsel that from his prophetic mouth  Shall seem heav'n's voice But first let me assail  This boy ambassador And therefore come I  To the queen's tent Open he seems and free  And from his shallow mind my art may draw  The dangerous schemes of his grave monitor  And do the chiefs rich service He approaches  But with him the old man I will withdraw  Till a fit time and muse on some device  To lure this youngling from his tutor's beck  Exit  ERIPHILUS MELANTHUS AETHRON  AETHRON  Here doth my guidance end Behold the place  Where all the livelong day the royal captives  Pour forth their piteous plaints That little tent  Spread in the darksom gloom of yon lone beech  Contains all Troy  ERIPHILUS  Thanks for thy conduct soldier  Yet sure it needed not This faroff station  These interrupted bursts of female sorrow  Proclaim it the queen's dwelling There she lies  The daughter of affliction whelm'd with woes  So vast humanity trembles to think her  Of its own species  MELANTHUS  From the book of fate  Jove's equal hand to every mortal man  Deals his due portion be it bliss or woe  Think not I mean to check thy noble nature  Thou too art born a man and as thou art  Thy soul perforce must melt at human sufferings  But learn dear youth with reverential awe  To kiss heav'n's ministring rod  ERIPHILUS  Oh good Melanthus  Cast but a thought on that illustrious scene  Which once was Troy Where now her menacing bulwarks  Rich palaces proud tow'rs that propt the skies  Where her intrepid heroes reverend seers  All all are fall'n Ev'n godlike Priam's fallen  The good old king Death's ruthless scythe has swept him  Amid the general carnage to the tomb  Him and his numerous race But oh ye pow'rs  If I'm ordain'd to save these royal captives  If I am sent your aweful delegate  To counteract their fatethey shall be free  I feel they shall I come heav'n's minister  And glory in the sacred embassy  MELANTHUS  Hear me Eriphilus  AETHRON  Do not repress  His noble ardor Here at Chersonesus  The Greeks but stay to raise Achilles' tomb  That finish'd the first favoring wind transports  Their fleet to Greece Go then illustrious strangers  Go like two guardian gods and sooth their souls  Exit  ERIPHILUS  I gocome on Melanthus my soul burns  To tell the joyful tidings  MELANTHUS  Yet bethink thee  When at Achilles' tomb thou didst unfold  Pyrechmes' will did Hecuba's redemption  Meet a full promise Thy impetuous zeal  Ev'n in the cause of virtue makes me tremble  Oh temper it dear youth Think on the perils  That lurk around thee on this dreadful isle  There's not a Greek but were thy secret known  Wears for thy life a dagger  ERIPHILUS  I'll be calm  Soon shalt thou find I willBut shou'd Atrides  Refuse the ransomby th' immortal pow'rs  Distress like Hecuba's  MELANTHUS  The queen's distress  Sinks in my heart as deep as thine which prompts  My steadiest caution Trust me this compliance  With each rash impulse howsoe'er disguis'd  In friendship's or in virtue's specious form  Is but mean incense to our own fond passions  Then calmly to the tent Back from the port  I shall return before thou hast dispatch'd  Thy business with the queen Be quick be cautious  Be secret tooRemember thou hast sworn  Exit  ERIPHILUS  I have And pow'rful must the pang be found  That scorn my soul the secret doth extort  ULYSSES ERIPHILUS  ULYSSES  Well hast thou sped brave youth Soon as the tomb  Rais'd by our chiefs to great Achilles' shade  Is finish'd thou shalt tender to Troy's queen  The first best gift of Jove her liberty  ERIPHILUS  Thanks to the Greeks the queen will soon be free  ULYSSES  The princess too thy happy hand leads forth  To gay Paeonia's court Her eyes will dart  New lustre 'mid the charms that glitter there  In beauty's brilliant circle  ERIPHILUS  Every tongue  Grows rapturous in her praise speaks her most fair  Yet not more fair than wise more wise than virtuous  The pow'rs of love and wisdom seem to vie  Which most shou'd deck her minion  ULYSSES  Blest the youth  Who cou'd inspire a heart like hers with love  ERIPHILUS  Oh blest indeed if there be such a youth  Whose peerless qualities  ULYSSES  Sometimes 'tis seen  That modest worth shrinks from the proffer'd bliss  Which the soul inly pines for That's false shame  There is a time when merit may step forth  And claim its due reward  ERIPHILUS  Surely there is  ULYSSES  Then fear not gallant youth that thy mild virtues  Want pow'r to draw from her enchanting eyes  A favoring smile on thee  ERIPHILUS  On me good heavens  A favoring smile on me  ULYSSES  And wherefore not  Large is her worth but she's of mortal mould  And know that on this sublunary scene  Perfection dwells not Nature's purest ore  Bears some alloy nay even yon glorious sun  Whose quick'ning beams all nature animate  Oft sends forth barren droughts and purple deaths  ERIPHILUS  But she the princess  ULYSSES  Think'st thou she enjoys  A sole exemption from a general fate  ERIPHILUS  Yes virtue white as hers  ULYSSES  The whitest virtue  'Scapes not unblemish'd Envy's baleful breath  Soils ev'n the snow that circles Dian's heart  What wonder therefore shou'd it brand the princess  ERIPHILUS  Oh heavens for what  ULYSSES  For that she was accomplice  With Paris in the murder of Achilles  Ev'n at the sacred shrine where her base tongue  Plighted the full assurance of her faith  ERIPHILUS  Infernal falsehood  ULYSSES  How this bold behaviour  I'll suits thy humble birth  ERIPHILUS  I am to blame  But were the villain here whose sland'rous tongue  Thus wounds my honor  ULYSSES  Wounds your honoryours  ERIPHILUS  Did I say mine it was too proud a word  Yetvirtue's is the general cause 'tis mine  'Tis yours oh king and each affront it bears  Wounds both our honors and demands revenge  Polyxena's no murd'rer  ULYSSES  But should Pyrrhus  Credit the babling rumour where were then  Thy embassy young man might not revenge  Devote her virgin beauties to the bed  Of a vile slave  ERIPHILUS  By heav'n he dares not  ULYSSES  Dares not  ERIPHILUS  Is he a king and dares he prostitute  A subject's virtue for she's now his subject  ULYSSES  She is his slave and not his subject youth  ERIPHILUS  Is he a man and dares he do a deed  Humanity must shudder but to hear  ULYSSES  Yet duty to his father's rev'rend shade  May prompt him to confine the captive princess  Till the doubt's clear'dOr haply she may gain  Permission to depart so the queen stays  A hostage in her stead And what imports it  Where Hecuba dreams out her few last hours  ERIPHILUS  Ye pow'rs imports it not to the poor queen  Who tends her sick'ning age what pious hands  Pay the last dismal office to her shade  Wash her pale corse and in the hallow'd urn  Her sacred ashes close  ULYSSES  Much do I love  Thy mild humanity that thus can melt  At even a stranger's woe for hardly cou'd'st thou  Shew tend'rer feelings for a Trojan's fate  Wert thou of Trojan birthHow now Talthybius  TALTHYBIUS ULYSSES ERIPHILUS  TALTHYBIUS  Great Agamemnon and the Grecian chiefs  Intreat your royal presence  ULYSSES  At my tent  To Eriphilus  Meet me anon and do not fear success  But yet take heed young man be not too sure  For danger loves to lurk close by the side  Of negligent security Repeat  Thy suit no more till the due rites are done  To great Achilles Importunity  Creates suspicion Know thou can'st not act  With too much caution ev'n the surest step  May lose its footing on this slippery world  Exit Uly and Tal  ERIPHILUS  False coz'ning GreekBut ah what fairy vision  Breaks on m' enchanted sightit comes upon me  The floating form of some divinity  That tends this mansion  ERIPHILUS POLYXENA  Say thou beauteous virgin  If to the presence of the queen of Troy  Thy guidance can conduct my friendly step  I bring her welcome tidings  POLYXENA  Stranger no  She shuns each human eye  ERIPHILUS  If thou art Polyxena  As something in my soul doth more than whisper  O royal maid permit an unknown youth  One moment's converse Never till this hour  Did his heart melt with such soft sympathy  POLYXENA  Brief be thy speech young stranger  ERIPHILUS  Hapless princess  Of fire of kingdom liberty bereft  With scarce a friend to save thee from the scoffs  Of cruel conqu'rors  POLYXENA  True I have no friend  My fire my brethren all have left the sun  But why shou'd my distress wake in thy breast  These sighs of pityhadst thou known the queen  ERIPHILUS  I know the iron hand of destiny  Lies heavy on the queen But wou'd fain hope  My tidings might relume her lamp of life  Had grief its flame extinguish'd  POLYXENA  Vain attempt  But say whence com'st thou youth and what thy errand  ERIPHILUS  From blest Paeonia's king sweet maid I come  Bear says Pyrechmes to the queen of Troy  And to her peerless daughter our best greetings  Inform them that the rugged blasts of fortune  Have firmer in my soul that friendship rooted  Their virtues planted there And if the calm  That lulls my court can blunt the edge of grief  Tell them my kingdom opens all its gates  To give them entrance  POLYXENA  He's a friend indeed  ERIPHILUS  Unworthy he to bear the name of king  Unworthy ev'n to bear the name of man  Who shares not such distressTo stop the ears  Of pity to the cries of common misery  Were a disgrace to nature but when fate  Frowns on an aged queena beauteous princess  I meant not to offend Believe me fair one  This tongue ne'er learn'd to gloze in flatt'ry's school  POLYXENA  I do believe thee Flattery may fawn  Lackey the heels of fortune's golden minions  And kiss the stool of majestybut oh  Can Hecuba can I her child be flatter'd  ERIPHILUS  Hear my soul speakdear as my own I hold  Your welfares nearest to my heart they lie  Mixt with my own and stranger as I seem  I for your precious lives wou'd pour my blood  Thou wonder'st at my words and my fond heart  Is all on fire to tell theebut an oath  A solemn oath in silence locks my lips  Till we quit Chersonesus Quickly therefore  Lead to the queen  POLYXENA  Oh still I fear I fear  Th' attempt were vain Believe me gentle youth  No pow'r on earth can aid her and in heav'n  No pow'r will aid her an inhuman wretch  Has murder'd every hope  ERIPHILUS  And has no hand  Planted a poniard in the villain's heart  POLYXENA  No he still walks the earth drinks the pure breath  Of morn and on his breast the sun of heaven  Darts a warm ray of gladness as it shone  For him alone  ERIPHILUS  Oh name th' inhuman foe  POLYXENA  Alas the fellest rancour of a foe  Patience might bearbut when the open heart  Unarm'd with caution's or suspicion's shield  Receives a stab from friendshipnay from duty  From filial dutyfor oh earth and heav'n  The villain Polymestor was her son  Her daughter's husband  ERIPHILIS  What the Thracian king  Who wedded her Ilione  POLYXENA  To him  Guarded by good Eumelus at the time  When Troy was first besieg'd she sent her son  Her infant Polydore and with him sent  Treasures of such vast value as might raise  Another kingdom shou'd Troy yield to fate  Tempted by these the barbarous monster murder'd  His innocent brotherOh had you beheld  The queen's dread transports when she first receiv'd  The fatal tidings  ERIPHILUS  Fluttering heart be still  POLYXENA  Prone on the earth she fell with one deep groan  Deep as if life went in it Then as struck  By some quick impulse stedfast gaz'd on heav'n  In speechless agony her bosom heav'd  She grasp'd her hands and bursting into tears  Fell tranc'd into my arms  ERIPHILUS  My struggling soul  Will bear no morethy Polydore sweet maid  Hah whither would my frenzy  POLYXENA  What of him  What of my Polydore thy words thy actions  Thy looks I've mark'd a mystery in all  Oh answer me good youth say didst thou know  My Polydore thou tremblest thy mild nature  Melts at the mention of that tragic tale  Alas who knows but thy fastflowing eyes  Did see the ruthless dagger rend his breast  And let out his sweet life while vainly thou  Didst wish for vengeance on the bloody villain  ERIPHILUS  Vengeance shall overtake him Else were I  As very a slave sweet maid as he a villain  POLYXENA  Good youthand wilt thou purge the groaning earth  Of such a wretch  ERIPHILUS  Else shou'd I blush to live  POLYXENA  Then hie thee to the queen For the blest hope  Of such revenge may rouze her sorrowing soul  To listen to thy suitAh go and prosper  ERIPHILUS  Lead on lead onNow bloody Polymestor  Tremblethy fate approaches  POLYXENA  May the spirit  Of my dead Hector march with thee along  Thrice noble youth bear a broad shield before thee  And edge thy mortal swordNow to the tent  For haply ere this time the dewy finger  Of morn has beckon'd from the queen's sad couch  The friendly sleep that crept upon her woe  And lo she comesperhaps 'twere best retire  For a short space Anon thou may'st return  Why dost thou tremble why thus gaze upon her  Haste screen thyself

tender hour of trial  Aid me some pitying god  HECUBA  Unmanner'd stranger  Whence this intrusion  ERIPHILUS  Think not honor'd queen  That my unbidden presence violates  Thy sanctity of sorrow I but claim  The privilege of mild humanity  To wipe the tears of virtue  HECUBA  Lead me hence  For ever from all eyes  ERIPHILUS  This blessed end  Draws me to Chersonesus and I bring  Most welcome

comes to mingle with thy grief  His social tears and to revenge thy wrongs  He from Paeonia comes  ERIPHILUS  To bring thee freedom  From good Pyrechmes  HECUBA  Say'st thou youth Pyrechmes  I knew him well He was my Priam's friend  Thou seest my memory's sound The good old king  I hope he lives most happyas I think  He never had a child  ERIPHILUS  His only child  Died in the womb and all the father's fondness  His charitable friendship show'rs on me  From him I come not rudely to restrain  Thy grief but give its tide a freer flow  Tis nature's kind relief to her poor children  She bids affliction weep away its woe  HECUBA  Friend if I yet can call one mortal friend  Be not deceived Nor let the good Pyrechmes  Thy sovereign be deceived Indeed I wou'd not  Your kindness shou'd misdeem poor Hecuba  An object fit for pity Generous youth  I'll tell thee what I will not tell the Greeks  But shou'd it ever 'scape thee  ERIPHILUS  It shall never  But your heart will not suffer you to speak  The tear starts in your eye Repress the secret  Till happier times permit  HECUBA  Till happier times  ERIPHILUS  Oh rest on hope that heav'nborn champion  Which ne'er forsakes the virtuous but in perils  Lends confidence and leads them unappall'd  Ev'n to the gates of death  POLYXENA  She heeds thee not  But I will watch the first calm interval  For now her mind seems hurrying thro' the waste  Of desolate despair too fast to mark  Compassion's call Ah see  HECUBA  The dreadful gods  Who in their ireful mood have turn'd me forth  This terrible example to mankind  Doubtless have cause wretched mortality  Believes and trembles but perforce must yield  I yield me too I bow to your dread wills  Yet when my mind with scrutiny severe  Tries judges a long life of fourscore years  And finds no crime but what dares look at pardon  Forgive forgive me if my bursting heart  Wishes that Hecuba had ne'er been born  ERIPHILUS  Oh yet try friendship's pow'r it's precious balm  Oft tho' it fails to cure yet ever calms  The rage of sorrow's wounds Oh 'tis a ray  Can melt the sable gloom of deep despair  Into the milder shade of melancholy  HECUBA  I prithee leave me youth My mind's disturb'd  Thine eye doth burden me It looks too deep  Into the secret sorrow of my soul  There's something in thy gesture in thy mien  I prithee leave me youth My mind's disturb'd  ERIPHILUS  Vast

it not large enough for my few ashes  Why wou'd'st thou bear this mockery of a queen  To gay Paeonia's court I can die here  ERIPHILUS  Wou'd'st thou die here a slave wou'd'st thou bequeath  To hostile hands the venerable relicks  Of royal Priam Heav'ns can Hector's mother  Rest undisturb'd beneath the horrid gloom  Of dire Achilles' shrine  HECUBA  Distracting thought  POLYXENA  Oh hear the voice of Heav'n in this good youth  Inviting thee to peace  ERIPHILUS  Tho' thy own life  Has lost it's value heav'ns can Hecuba  See that fair flower thus droop its languid head  Oh save the princess

queen  To hear the dreadful tale Achilles' ghost  Ev'n in the realms of death thirsting for blood  Demands thy daughter's life What not one word  Speak wretched queen the heart that feels such pangs  Must give them vent or break  HECUBA  It will not break  Oh wou'd to heav'n it cou'd what not one child  Enter POLYXENA  VIRGIN  Alas Polyxena  SIGEA  Oh illstar'd maid  POLYXENA  Turn not thine eyes

Painful is the struggle  In a fond mother's breast  HECUBA  Am I a mother  Oh insupportable I was a mother  'Twas the sole comfort left my widow'd age  But what the furies in their wrath had spar'd  These human fiends tear from me  ULYSSES  Calmly hear me  Think if the chance of war  HECUBA  Heav'n's was my daughter  Achilles' murderer She never wrong'd him  No if he thirsts for blood 'tis Helen's blood  He fought for Helen he for Helen died  ULYSSES  Yet think a moment Shall we wear the laurels  Won with his life and cast a cold contempt  On his dead ashes What if Agamemnon  Once more shou'd call to arms Wou'd the brave soldiers  Rouze at his voice and rush on fate to share  Th'inglorious treatment of their valiant dead  HECUBA  Patience sweet heav'n What must ye tear to pieces  Humanity Be murd'rers to display  Your guilty gratitude  POLYXENA  Oh Hecuba  Let not thy rage provoke a potent victor  HECUBA  No I will not provoke a potent victor  I'll check these foolish transports of despair  See my rage melts to miserable tears  I'll but remind him of that hour when Helen  Discern'd him thro' a vagrant's dark disguise  And to Troy's queen disclos'd the daring treason  I'll but remind him how his rev'rend age  Soften'd my soul and sav'd his forfeit life  ULYSSES  No time shall from my grateful memory raze  That moment when I clasp'd thy royal knees  HECUBA  Lo in my turn thus prostrate on the ground  I clasp thy royal kneesBy thy good genius  The guardian god who from thy natal hour  Chac'd the black influence of my baleful star  Have mercy on my age spare my dear child  As I preserv'd thy life preserve thou hers  There's blood enough of mine already shed  Spare my dear child in thy last hour of anguish  That action shall sit smiling on thy soul  Shall gild the trophies of thy honor'd tomb  Oh spare her spare her so may thy dear queen  Ne'er feel the pangs I feel  ULYSSES  Much I regard  Th' unhappy princess gratitude and pity  Prompt me to save her But till she's devoted  To great Achilles' shrine no fav'ring wind  Shall from this island loose our fastbound fleet  Thus spoke his mighty shade at the dread menace  Calchas pronounc'd her doom Vain then were pray'rs  Vain ev'ry mortal aid  HECUBA  Do not abuse  A victor's pow'r Great as thou art oh king  Remember thou'rt a man Tell tell the Greeks  Honor wou'd bleed to see weak helpless women  Murder'd before their altars by that fury  Which spar'd them in the battle's bloody horrors  Plead plead with all thy pow'rs my poor child's cause  Oh plead the widow's cause  ULYSSES  See thro' yon camp  Hundreds of hoary matrons some thy equals  In misery as many youthful brides  Wailing their murder'd lords Think on their fate  And calmly bear thy own Greece owes her glory  To

come gaze on these dread remains  This monument of ruin'd royalty  Exeunt  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr GARRICK  And Spoken by Miss BRIDE  STrip'd of my tragic weeds and rais'd from death  In freedom's land again I draw my breath  Tho' late a Trojan ghost in Charon's ferry  I'm now an English girl alive and merry  Hey Presto I'm in Greece a maiden slain  Nowstranger stilla maid in Drurylane  No more by barb'rous men and laws confin'd  I claim my native rights to speak my mind  Tho' poring pedants should applaud this piece  Behold a championfoe profest of Greece  I throw my gauntlet to the critic race  Throws down her glove  Come forth bold GreciansMeet me face to face  Come forth ye men of learning at my call  Learning a little feeling's worth it all  And you of taste and fashion I defy  Throws down another glove  But hold  You  hate the Greek as much as I  Then let us join our force and boldly speak  That English ev'ry thing surpasses Greek  Kill a young virgin to resist unable  Kill her like houselamb for a  dead  man's ta  le  Well may you tremble ladies and look pale  Do you not shudder parents at this tale  You  sacrifice a daughter now and then  To rich old wither'd  half  departed men  With us there's no compulsive law that can  Make a live girl to wed a quite dead man  Had I been wedded to some ancient king  I mean a Grecian Ancient's not the thing  Then had our Bard made ample reparation  Then had you seen a Grecian  Coronation  Sneer not ye critics at this rage for shew  That honest hearts at coronations glow  Nor snarl that our faint copies glad their eyes  When from the thing itself such blessings rise  The END
