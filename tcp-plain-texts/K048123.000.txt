Stage so situated that  Lubin  who comes from it during the Symphony of the Duet is sometimes seen and sometimes concealed by the Trees A Cottage on one Side near the Front  LUBIN and CICELY  AIR and DUET  LUBIN  'MIDST thrushes blackbirds nightingales  Whose songs are echo'd from the vales  Trudging along through thick and thin  Thank Fate at last I've reach'd the door  How pleas'd they'll be to let me in  I've walk'd amain  And yet ne'er leaving her before  Hast'ning to see my love again  I thought each furlong half a score  They're long methinks  CICELY    At the window    Who's there I trow  LUBIN  Look out good mother don't you know  'Tis Lubin How does Gillian do  And Hodge and Margery and Sue  CICELY  Not a whit better Sir for you  LUBIN  Why what's the matter Why d'ye frown  CICELY  You shall know all when I come down  LUBIN  What is the meaning of all this  Oh here she comes    Enter  Cicely  CICELY  Well what's amiss  Who are you making all this stir  If to come in you mean  You may as well be jogging Sir  While yet your boots are green  LUBIN  I'm perfectly like one astound  I know not I declare  Whether I'm walking on the ground  Or flying in the air  This treatment is enough to quite  Bereave one of one's wits  CICELY  Good lackaday and do you bite  Pray ever in these fits  LUBIN  But you are jesting  CICELY  Think so still  LUBIN  Where's Gillian  CICELY  She's not here  She's gone abroad Sir she is ill  She's dead you cannot see her  She knows you not did never see  Your face in all her life  In short tomorrow she's to be  Another person's wife  I tell you we know nothing at all about you  LUBIN  You don't Why then may happen my name 'en't Lubin Blackthorn and 'tis likely I did not set out six months ago to see my father down in the west and ask his consent to my marriage with your daughter Gillian and I warrant you I did not stay till my father died to take possession of his farm and every thing that belonged to him nay you'll want to make me believe presently that I 'en't come now to settle affairs and take her back into the country with me  CICELY  Don't make a fool of yourself young man get back to your farm and graze your oxen You won't get a lamb out of our fold I promise you  LUBIN  Well but in sober sadness you 'en't serious are you  CICELY  Serious Why don't I tell you Gillian's to be married to another tomorrow  LUBIN  Where is she I'll hear it from her own mouth  CECILY  I believe about this time she is trying on her wedding suit  LUBIN  And who is this she is going to be married to I'll see him and know what he has done to deserve her more than I have  CECILY  Done to deserve her  LUBIN  Yes done to deserve her You forget I suppose when I've carried her milk pail for her or taken her share of work in the hayfield how you us'd to say that I was a true lover indeed but I don't desire to have any thing to say to youyou'll repent first  CECILY  Poor young man  LUBIN  Nay but don't you think you have us'd me very ill now  CECILY  I thought you said you would not speak a word to me  LUBIN  Nay but Dame Cicely  CECILY  Your servant If you have a mind to be a brideman we shall be glad to see you    Exit  SCENE II  LUBIN  A very pretty spot of work this And so I have come a hundred miles to make a fool of myself and to be laughed at by the whole village  AIR  I  I lock'd up all my treasure  I journey'd many a mile  And by my grief did measure  The passing time the while  II  My business done and over  I hasten'd back amain  Like an expecting lover  To view it once again  III  But this delight was stifled  As it began to dawn  I found the casket rifled  And all my treasure gone  SCENE III  Enter EASY  LUBIN  Here comes her father I don't suppose he had much hand in it for so he had his afternoon's nap in quiet he was always for letting things go as they would So Master Easy you have consented I find to marry your daughter to another after promising me over and over that nobody should have her but me  EASY  My wife desired me  LUBIN  Your mind is strangely altered farmer Easy But do me one piece of justice howevertell me who is it you intend for your soninlaw  EASY  'Tis a rich one I assure you  LUBIN  And so you have broke your word and all for the lucre of gain And pray now don't you expect to be hooted out of the village  EASY  I can't say I do  LUBIN  Then they're a vile pack of wretches and I'll get away from them as soon as I can Go on go onlet me know all  EASY  You are in a passion child so I don't regard what you say but I think I should have been out of my wits to have refused Mr Steady the rich Quaker  LUBIN  What is it he then  EASY  It is  LUBIN  What he that you are steward to he that does so much good all about and he that gives a portion every Mayday to a damsel as a reward for her sweetheart's ingenuity  EASY  The same You have seen the nature of itthat villager who can boast of having done the most ingenuous thing claims a right to demand a farm containing sixty acres rent free for seven years and a hundred pounds to stock it together with whatever maiden he chooses provided he gains her consent and it is a good custom for the young men who formerly us'd to vie with one another in the feats of strength now as I may say vie with one another in feats of understanding  LUBIN  And so he is to marry your daughter  EASY  Things are as I tell you And for that purpose he has taken Gillian into his own house had her taught music and to say the truth she is a different thing to what she was when you saw her last  LUBIN  She is indeed for when I saw her last she told me that all the riches in the world should never make her forget me  EASY  But since she has changed her mind and it so falls out that tomorrow is Mayday you would do well to study some ingenuous thing and get this portion for a more deserving damsel  LUBIN  No farmer Easy her using me ill is no reason why I should do any thing to make me angry with myself I swore to love her for ever and I'll keep my word tho' I see she has broke hers  EASY  Do what you please I must be gone  LUBIN  Nay but tell me one thingdid Gillian herself consent to this  EASY  You'll know all in good time    Exit  SCENE IV  LUBIN  AIR  Women are Willo'theWhisps 'tis plain  The closer they seem still the more they retire  They teaze you and jade you  And round about lead you  Without hopes of shelter  Dingdong helterskelter  Thro' water and fire  And when you believe every danger and pain  From your heart you may banish  And you're near the possession of what you desire  That instant they vanish  And the devil a bit can you catch them again  By some they're not badly compar'd to the sea  Which is calm and tempestuous within the same hour  Some say they are Syrens but take it from me  They're a sweet race of angels o'er man that have power  His person his heart nay his reason to seize  And lead the poor creature wherever they please    Exit  SCENE V  A Room in the Quaker's House with Glass Doors in the Back  Enter FLORETTA and GILLIAN  FLORETTA  Pooh pooh you must forget Lubin  GILLIAN  How can you talk so Floretta I won't tho' and none of them shall make me they all frightened me by saying it was a bad thing not to obey my parents and so I consented to marry this Quakerman but there's a wide difference between marrying him and forgetting Lubin  FLORETTA  And so you would be silly enough to prefer being the homely wife of a clown to rolling about in your own coach having your own servants to wait on you and in short leading the life of a fine lady  GILLIAN  Oh lord I am sick at the thoughts of being a fine lady But what's the reason Floretta that my friends want to make me so unhappy I am sure I'd do any thing rather than vex them  FLORETTA  Why you know that Mr Steady's will is a law to us all and as he had desired your friends to consent to this marriage how could they refuse  GILLIAN  Well but you know he is a very goodnatured man and I dare say if I was to tell him how disagreeable he is and that I can't bear the sight of him he'd let me marry Lubin  FLORETTA  Suppose you try  GILLIAN  So I will  FLORETTA  But how are you sure this Lubin you are so fond of is as fond of you  GILLIAN  I've tried a thousand ways  AIR  I  A kernel from an apple core  One day on either cheek I wore  Lubin was plac'd on my right cheek  That on my left did Hodge bespeak  Hodge in an instant dropp'd to ground  Sure token that his love's unsound  But Lubin nothing could remove  Sure token his is constant love  II  To find the man who loves me best  "Fly" said I "south north east and west"  The ladybird is westward flown  For westward is my Lubin gone  Last Valentine at break of day  Before the stars were chas'd away  I met or may he faithless prove  Lubin my Valentine my love  III  Last May I sought to find a snail  That might my lover's name reveal  Which finding home I quickly sped  And on the hearth the embers spread  When if my letters I can tell  I saw it mark a curious L  Oh may this omen lucky prove  For L's for Lubin and for Love  SCENE VI  Enter STEADY  STEADY  Verily thou rejoicest me to find thee singing and in such spirits  GILLIAN  I was singing to be sure but I cannot say much about being in spirits  STEADY  No Why do not thy approaching nuptials lift up and as it were exhilarate thee  FLORETTA  Lord Sir there's no persuading her nothing will get this Lubin out of her head  STEADY  And why young maiden wilt thou not listen unto me Have I not for thy pleasure given into all the vanities in which youth delights I tell thee that altho' my complexion be saturnine my manners are not austere why therefore likest thou not me  GILLIAN  I should like you very well if you were my father but I don't like you at all for a husband  STEADY  And wherefore I pray thee  GILLIAN  Oh there are reasons enough  STEADY  Which be they  GILLIAN  Why in the first place I should want you to change your cloaths and to have you as spruce as I am  STEADY  Rather do thou change those thou wearest unto the likeness of mine The dove regardeth not the gay plumage of the gaudy mackaw and the painted rainbow delighteth our sight but it vanishes away yea even as a vapour What more  GILLIAN  Why in the next place I should want to change your age and have you as young as I am  STEADY  She speaketh her mind and I esteem her Therefore why then since it is necessary unto my peace that thou shouldst become bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh and thou canst not fashion thy disposition unto the likeness of mine I will make it my study to double thy pleasure until that which is now gratitude shall at last become love  GILLIAN  Ah you'll never see that day so you had better take no trouble about it  STEADY  Thou art mistaken and when thou beholdest the gambols tomorrow on the green  GILLIAN  I shall long most monstrously to make one amongst them  STEADY  And so thou shalt Goodness forbid that I should withold from thee those pleasures that are innocent  AIR  I  While the lads of the village shall merrily ah  Sound the tabors I'll hand thee along  And I say unto thee that verily ah  Thou and I will be first in the throng  While the lads c  II  Just then when the swain who last year won the dower  With his mates shall the sports have begun  When the gay voice of gladness resounds from each bow'r  And thou long'st in thy heart to make one  Whilst the lads c  III  Those joys which are harmless what mortal can blame  'Tis my maxim that youth should be free  And to prove that my words and my deeds are the same  Believe me thou'lt presently see  While the lads c    Exit  Steady  SCENE VII  GILLIAN  What an unfortunate girl am I Floretta  FLORETTA  What makes you think so  GILLIAN  Why what would make you think so too if you was in my place  FLORETTA  Well then I own I do think so and if you'll promise not to betray me I'll stand your friend in this affair  GILLIAN  Will you Oh law And what must be done Floretta  FLORETTA  WhyBut see yonder's a lover of mine I'll make him of use to us  GILLIAN  Lord what's Soloman your lover I hate him with his proverbs and his formality What the deuce do you intend to do with him  FLORETTA  What women general do with their lovers my dear make a fool of himMr Soloman  SCENE VIII  Enter SOLOMAN  'SOLOMON  I listened when lo thou calledst me and as the voice of the shepherd is delightful unto the sheep in his fold so even is thy voice delightful unto me  FLORETTA  There's a lover for you Why the spirit moves you Mr Solomon to say abundance of fine things  SOLOMON  According unto the proverb love maketh a wit of the fool  FLORETTA  Yes and a fool of the wit But do you love me  SOLOMON  When thou seest one of our speakers dancing a jigg at a country wake when thou beholdest the  brethren take off their beavers and bow their bodies or hearest them swear then believe I love thee not  FLORETTA  A very pompous speech upon my word  SOLOMON  An ill phrase may come from a good heart but all men cannot do all things one getteth an estate by what another getteth an halter a foolish man  FLORETTA  Talks just as you do now But will you do a little favour I have to beg of you  SOLOMON  Slaves obey the will of them who command them  FLORETTA  There is a young man who has been us'd ill  SOLOMON  'Tis very like kind words are easier met with than good actions charity seldom goeth out of the house while illnature is always rambling abroad  FLORETTA  His name is Lubin and I want you to enquire him out and appoint him to meet me tomorrow morning very early in the row of elms at the bottom of the garden  SOLOMON  But shall I not in this offend my master  GILLIAN  Never mind him suppose if he should find us out and scold us a little  SOLOMON  Truehigh words break no bones But wilt thou give me a smile if I do this for thee  GILLIAN  Ay that she shall Mr Solomon and I'll give yon another  SOLOMON  But wilt thou appoint the spousal day  FLORETTA  You are so hasty Mr Solomon  SOLOMON  And with reason a man may catch cold while his coat is making Shall it be tomorrow  FLORETTA  Must I promise  SOLOMON  Yea and perform too 'tis not plumbs only that maketh the pudding  FLORETTA  Well well we'll talk about it another time  SOLOMON  No time like the time present  FLORETTA  Nay now but go Soloman  SOLOMON  An egg today is better than a chicken tomorrow  FLORETTA  Pray now go  SOLOMON  Yea I will A bush in the hand is better than two in the bird    Exit  GILLIAN  What a fright of a creature it is How good you are Floretta  FLORETTA  I could not bear to see you us'd in such a manner and when I reflected on it it went to my heart  AIR  I  I said to myself now Floretta says I  Supposing the case was your own  Would you not be the first ev'ry method to try  To get rid of this canting old drone  You well know you wou'd and you're worse than a Turk  If one minute you hesitate whether  In justice you should not your wits set to work  To bring Lubin and Gillian together  II  To be certain old Formal will frown and look blue  Call you baggage deceitful boldface  With all manner of names he can lay his tongue to  And perhaps turn you out of your place  What of that Let him frown let him spit all his spite  Your heart still as light as a feather  With truth shall assure you 'tis but doing right  To bring Gillian and Lubin together    Exit  SCENE IX  GILLIAN  I wonder what they plague us poor girls so for Fathers and mothers in this case are comical folks they are for ever telling one what they'll do to please one and yet when they take it into their heads they make nothing of desiring us to be miserable as long as one lives I wish I could be dutiful and happy too May be Floretta will bring mattters about for me to marry Lubin with their consent if she does lord how I shall love her  AIR  The captive linnet newly taken  Vainly strives and vents its rage  With struggling pants by hopes forsaken  And flutters in its golden cage  But once releas'd to freedom soaring  Quickly on some neighbouring tree  It sings as if its thanks 't were pouring  To bless the hand that set it free    Exit  SCENE X  A Wall at the Back of the Quaker's Garden  Lubin  afterwards  Steady  and  Easy  then  Solomon  and last  Gillian  and  Floretta  who look over the Garden Wall  LUBIN  'Tis all true 'tis all true there's not a soul in the whole village that has not had something to say to me about it Some pity me others laugh at me and all blame me for making myself uneasy I know if I did as I ought to do I should get me back and think no more concerning of them but instead of that here am I come creeping to the gardengate to see if I can get a sight of her Who comes yonderOh 'tis her father and the old Quaker I'll listen and hear what they are talking about  Enter STEADY and EASY  STEADY  Friend Easy hie thee home to thy wife tell her to hold herself ready for tomorrow and say unto her that when the youth who gains the customary dower shall receive from me the hand of his bride I will from thee receive the hand of thy daughter  LUBIN  Why I must be turned fool to hear all this and not say a word  STEADY  Get thee gone friend    Exit  Easy  Enter SOLOMON  STEADY  Where art thou going  SOLOMON  The truth is not to be spoken at all times Into the village about a little business for Mrs Floretta  STEADY  Verily I do suspect thee to be in a plot against me I will not have thee therefore do this business stay here by me  Floretta  and  Gillian  look over the Garden Wall  FLORETTA  I wonder whether Solomon is gone  GILLIAN  Oh dear Floretta as sure as you're alive yonder's Lubin  FLORETTA  So there is And see on the other side the old fellow talking to Solomon  QUINTETTO  STEADY  Regard the instructions I say  Which I am now giving thee  SOLOMON  Yea  STEADY  Speed by times to friend Easy and bid him take care  The minstrels the feasting and sports to prepare  He must keep away Lubin too  LUBIN  Can I bear this  GILLIAN  Won't you call out to Solomon presently  FLORETTA  Yes  STEADY  And do thou attend with thy dobbins of beer  And see that our neighbours and friends have good cheer  Make the whole village welcome and  FLORETTA  Solomon  STEADY  Stay  FLORETTA  You blockhead come here  STEADY  Dost thou notice me  SOLOMON  Yea    Here as often as  Solomon  tries to speak to  Floretta  and  Gillian  he is prevented by  Steady  STEADY  Stand still then  FLORETTA  Friend Solomon  LUBIN  Is it not she  FLORETTA  Mind the oaf  GILLIAN  Ha ha ha  LUBIN  They're laughing at me  STEADY  See that garlands are ready  GILLIAN AND FLORETTA  Ha ha ha  LUBIN  Again  Oh Gillian thou falsest of women since when  Have I merited this  STEADY  so that when on the lawn  LUBIN  But I'll speak to her  GILLIAN  Look look he sees us  STEADY  Begone  But hark thee  LUBIN  Oh Gillian how wicked thou art  Thou hast fool'd me betray'd me and broke my poor heart  But henceforth with safety in infamy reign  For I never no never will see you again    Exit  Lubin  GILLIAN  He's gone Now lord lord I'm so mad I cou'd cry  FLORETTA  Here Solomon  STEADY  Go where I told thee  SOLOMON  I fly  STEADY  Well do then and tarry no where by the way  FLORETTA  Quickly run after Lubin  GILLIAN  Do Solomon  SOLOMON  Yea  STEADY  What Gillian art there  GILLIAN  Yes I am  STEADY  Why dost sigh  When the hour of thy happiness waxeth so nigh  GILLIAN  Why you know well enough  STEADY  Come come do not sorrow  GILLIAN  Go along Get away  STEADY  By yea and by nay  Thy mind shall be easy believe me tomorrow    Exit  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Garden  Enter LUBIN  LUBIN  WHATapiague have they brought me here for I am in a rare humourthey'd better not provoke methey would not have set eyes on me again if it had not been that I want to see how she can look me in the face after all this  Enter FLORETTA  FLORETTA  There he is  LUBIN  She shall find that I am not to be persuaded into any thing  FLORETTA  We shall try  LUBIN  And if her father and all of them were at this minute begging and praying me to marry her they should see  FLORETTA  That you would consent to it with all your heart  LUBIN  I'll just abuse her heartily tell the Quaker what an old fool he is call her father and mother all to pieces for persuading her to marry him then get me down to my farm and be as careful to keep myself out of love as I would to keep my wheat free from tares a fox from my poultry or the murrain from my cattle  FLORETTA  If I should make you alter your tone now  LUBIN  I remember the time when 'twas who should love most but what a fool am I to think of that nowNo no she shall find I can forget her as easily as she can forget me  FLORETTA  That I firmly believe  DUET  FLORETTA taps his shoulder  How Lubin sad this is not common  What do ye sigh for  LUBIN  A woman  FLORETTA  How fair is she who on your brow  Prints care  LUBIN  Just such a toy as thou  FLORETTA  What has she done  LUBIN  For ever lost my love  FLORETTA  That's sad indeed And can no prayers move  LUBIN  None 'tis too late that folly is o'er  My love's turn'd to hate and I'll see her no more  The time has been when all our boast  Was who should love the other most  How did I count without my host  I thought her mine for ever  But now I know her all deceit  Will tell her so whene'er we meet  And was she sighing at my feet  FLORETTA  You would forgive her  LUBIN  Never  FLORETTA  Then I may e'en go back I find  To serve you Sir I was inclin'd  But to your own advantage blind  'Twou'd be a vain endeavour  'Tis certain she does all she can  And we had form'd a charming plan  To take her from the Quakerman  LUBIN  Nay pr'ythee tell it  FLORETTA  Never  SCENE II  Enter GILLIAN  FLORETTA  Here she is now let her speak for herself  GILLIAN  Oh Lubin why would you not hear me speak to you yesterday I did not sleep a wink all night for thinking on't  LUBIN  Why had I not reason Gillian to be angry when every one I met told me what a fool you had made of me  GILLIAN  Why what could I do Floretta here knows that I have done nothing but abuse old Steady from morning till night about it  FLORETTA  Come come don't let us dispute about what's past but make use of the present opportunity we have not a moment to lose Get you to my master make up a plausible story how ill you have been us'd by an old fellow who has run away with your sweetheart and tell him that you come to complain to  him as you know 'tis a custom for every body to do when they are us'd ill  GILLIAN  What a rare girl you are Floretta But are you sure he won't know him  FLORETTA  No I heard your father say he never saw him in all his life  LUBIN  That's lucky leave me alone for a plausible story    Exit  SCENE III  Enter SOLOMON  FLORETTA  Here comes my formal messenger Well Solomon where's your master  SOLOMON  In the great hall waiting your approach  GILLIAN  I am very much obliged to you Mr Solomon  SOLOMON  Words cost us nothing If I have done thee service thank me by deeds  GILLIAN  Oh what you want me to coax Floretta to marry you  SOLOMON  I do  FLORETTA  Solomon has it very much in his power to make me love him  SOLOMON  How I pray thee  FLORETTA  Why I have said a hundred times that I never would marry a man who had always a proverb in his mouth  GILLIAN  So you have Floretta I have heard you  SOLOMON  And thou wouldst have me leave off minea word to the wisethou shalt hear them no more  FLORETTA  Why that sounded something like one  SOLOMON  It must be done by degrees Word by word great books are written  FLORETTA  Again  SOLOMON  I pray thee to pardon me I shall soon conquer them but Rome was not built in a day  FLORETTA  Oh this is making game of one  SOLOMON  I protest I meant no ill I shall forget them I say 'Tis a long lane that hath no turning  GILLIAN  Poor Solomon He can't help it  FLORETTA  Have you any desire to marry me  SOLOMON  Ask the vintner if the wine be good  FLORETTA  Because I will have my way in this and I think it very hard you won't strive to oblige me  SOLOMON  I protest I strive all I can but custom is second nature and what is bred in the boneVerily I had like to have displeased thee again  FLORETTA  Oh what you found yourself out did you Then there's some hopes of amendment  SOLOMON  It shall be amended A thing resolved upon is half done and 'tis an old sayingbut what have I to do with old sayings  FLORETTA  Very true  SOLOMON  But I must attend on the green  FLORETTA  Well go and by the time I see you next take care that you get rid of all your musty old savings I wonder how so sensible a man as you could give into such nonsense  SOLOMON  Evil communication corrupts good manners and a dogPies on the dog Well thou shalt be obeyed believe mePies on the dog    Exit  SCENE IV  GILLIAN  For goodness sake what excuse do you intend to make to him when he has left off his proverbs  FLORETTA  Why desire him to leave off something else and at the rate of one in a month he won't have parted with all his particularities in seven years  GILLIAN  Well how we do use men in love with us when we take it into our heads  FLORETTA  And yet they are fools to be used so by us But I am sure you will never use Lubin illhe will make you the happiest girl in the world  AIR  I  The face which frequently displays  An index of the mind  Dame Nature has her various ways  To stamp on human kind  II  Purs'd brows denote the purseproud man  Intent on some new scheme  Clos'd eyes the politician  For ever in a dream  III  But features of ingenuous kind  Which semblance bear of truth  Display methinks in face and mind  The portrait of this youth    Exeunt  SCENE V  A Hall  Enter STEADY and LUBIN  LUBIN  Your servant Sir  STEADY  Thine friend  LUBIN  I hope Sir you'll excuse my rudeness  STEADY  I don't perceive thee guilty of any  LUBIN  May be not but I made bold to ask if I might not trouble your worship about a little affair concerning my being sadly ill used  STEADY  Speak freely  LUBIN  Why there's a covetous old hunks and like your worship that because he is rich would fain take away a young woman that I was to be married to without her consent or mine  STEADY  Has the old hunks thou speakest of the consent of her friends  LUBIN  They have no consent to give and please you  STEADY  And why I pray thee  LUBIN  Because as I take it if any body gives a thing 'tis not theirs any longer and they gave me their consent long ago  STEADY  Thou speakest the truth But what wouldst thou have me do in this business  LUBIN  Why please you Sir I have often heard it said of your worship that there were three things you'd never suffer in our village if you could help itThe maidens to go without sweetheartsthe industrious without rewardand the injured without redressand to be sure it made me think that if you were once acquainted with the rights of this affair you would not suffer it go on for says I set in case it was his worship's own concern how would he like to have the young woman taken away from him that he is going to marry  STEADY  There thou saidst it  LUBIN  Why yes I thought that was bringing the case home  STEADY  Well attend on the lawn make thy claim known and if the parties concerned are present deliver to them what I now write thee for that purpose    Goes to the Table  LUBIN  This is better and better stillHow they'll all be laughed atHe little thinks he is signing his consent to part with Gillian  STEADY  Do thou direct it thou knowest to whom it is to be given  LUBIN  Yes I am sure the person will be upon the lawn  STEADY  And fear not to tell him thy mind  LUBIN  I shan't be sparing of that I warrant you  STEADY  Urge thy ill usage  LUBIN  Never fear me  STEADY  And tell him that by endeavouring to prevent thy happiness he hath done thee an injury he can never repair For that riches are given us to comfort and not distress those beneath us  AIR  LUBIN  I  With respect Sir to you be it spoken  So well do I like your advice  He shall have it and by the same token  I don't much intend to be nice  II  There's something so comical in it  I ne'er was so tickled by half  And was I to die the next minute  I verily believe I should laugh  III  Affairs happen better and better  Your worship but mind the old put  When first he looks over the letter  I say what a figure he'll cut    Exit  SCENE VI  Enter GILLIAN and FLORETTA  FLORETTA  Yonder he goesI wonder how he succeeded  STEADY  Come Gillian I was anxious to see theethe time draweth near and the sports will shortly begin upon the lawn  GILLIAN  I long to be there as much as you do  STEADY  I doubt it notAnd when thou seest thyself the queen of such a set of happy mortals I know thou wilt consent that this shall be thy bridalday  FLORETTA  Yes Sir if you'll consent to her having Lubin  GILLIAN  And I can tell you he's to be there  STEADY  Lubin I'm sure will not oppose what I decree  GILLIAN  I'm sure he won't part with me quietly  STEADY  Thou shalt see that he will not dare to murmur at my will and pleasure But come we are expected Verily I find myself exalted even to transport in that I am going this day to make thee a bride  AIR  I  In verity damsel thou surely wilt find  That my manners are simple and plain  That my words and my actions my lips and my mind  By my own goodwill never are twain  I love theeumph  Would move theeumph  Of love to be partaker  Relent thenumph  Consent thenumph  And take thy upright Quaker  II  Tho' vain I am not nor of foppery possess'd  Wouldst thou yield to be wedded to me  Thou shouldst find gentle damsel a heart in my breast  As joyful as joyful can be  I love thee c    Exit  SCENE VII  GILLIAN  Why I don't see but that I am as bad off as ever Floretta  FLORETTA  I don't know what to make of it myself but however if the worst comes to the worst you must downright give them the slip and run away  GILLIAN  I'cod and so I will Lubin has got enough for us both  SCENE VIII  Enter LUBIN  LUBIN  Gillian I had just watched the old Quaker out and slipped back to tell you that every thing goes well I have got his consent under his hand to marry the young woman  GILLIAN  And does he know 'tis me  LUBIN  Not a bit but you know he never forfeits his word so that we have him safe enough But don't let us be seen together I am going to the lawnwe shall have fine sport I warrant you    Exit  AIR  GILLIAN  I  Again I feel my bosom bound  My heart sits lightly on its seat  My griefs are all in rapture drown'd  In every pulse new pleasure beats  II  Upon my troubled mind at last  Kind fate has pour'd a friendly balm  So after dreadful perils past  At length succeeds a smiling calm    Exit  SCENE the LAST  A Lawn with a Maypole  Steady Easy Lubin Solomon Gillian Floretta Cicely  Country Lads and Lasses  STEADY  Friends and neighbours it hath been my study since I first came among you to do whatever might procure me your love and esteem I have instituted a custom the salutary effects of which I view with great gladness and each is well entitled to the reward he has received I will now propose to you a question to see which of you can make the most ready reply What of all things in the world is the  longest and the shortest the swiftest and the slowest the most precious the most neglected and without which nothing can be done  First COUNTRYMAN  The earth  STEADY  No  Second COUNTRYMAN  Ah I knew you would not guess it Light and please your worship  STEADY  Thou art as much mistaken as he friend  LUBIN  'Tis my belief 'tis time Nothing can be longer because 'twill last for evernothing can be shorter because 'tis gone in a momentnothing can go slower than it does when one's away from her one loves and nothing swifter when one's with her 'Tis an old saying That 'tis as precious as gold and yet we are always throwing it away And your worship as a proof that nothing can be done without it if the old gentleman we were a talking about today had not had the opportunity of my absence he could not have run away with a certain young damsel  STEADY  Thou hast solved my question aright and art indeed an ingenious youth If thou goest on as thou hast begun I foresee that thou wilt win the dower Give me now your several claims sealed up as usual and go on with the sports while I peruse them    A  DANCE  here  STEADY  Hast thou nothing to give young man    To  Lub  LUBIN  Why yes please your worship I have  STEADY  This is addressed unto me Let me view the contentsHow my own handThou expectest I find to receive this damsel for thy wife and thy plot which thou didst so artfully carry on was contrived to make my neighbours laugh at me  LUBIN  No with respect to your worship 'twas to keep them from laughing at you  STEADY  How is this  LUBIN  Why you know you advised me to tell the old gentleman a piece of my mind  STEADY  Thou shalt see the revenge I will take upon thee for this I will comply with the contents of this paper to the utmost Here read this aloud    To a Countryman  COUNTRYMAN  "If the youth Lubin"  STEADY  Thou seest I knew thee then  LUBIN  I am afraid I have been too cunning for myself  STEADY  You see neighbours how I am treated and I request of you to be witness how much it behoveth us to resent such injuries Go on  COUNTRYMAN  "If the youth Lubin will faithfully love and cherish the maiden called Gillian and make her a good helpmate I do freely give my consent to her becoming his wife and request her friends to do the same"  LUBIN  How is this  STEADY  This is my revenge By thy ingenuity thou hast won the dower and by thy truth and integrity my friendship  LUBIN  Was ever the like  GILLIAN  I never could abide you before but now I shall love you as long as I live  STEADY  Verily my heart warmeth unto you both your innocency and love are equally respectable And would the voluptuous man taste a more exquisite sensation than the gratifing his passions let him prevail upon himself to do a benevolent action  CATCH  Let nimble dances beat the ground  Let tabor flagelet and fife  Be heard from every bower  Let the can go round  What's the healthLong life  To the donor of the dower  FINIS
