DECEMBER  LAst of the months severest of them all  Woe to the regions where thy terrors fall  Hail to thy tempests which the deep deform  Thrice hail thy ruthless hurricane and storm  Now Eolus let forth thy mightiest blast  By land to rock the spire by sea the mast  Let earth and ocean feel thy potent sway  And give thy blasts their full impetuous way  For lo the fiery horses of the sun  Thro' the twelve Signs their rapid course have run  Time like a serpent bites his forked tail  And Winter on a Goat bestrides the gale  Rough blows the north wind near Arcturus' star  And sweeps unrein'd across the polar bar  On the world's confines where the seabears prowl  And Greenland whales like moving islands roll  There thro' the skies on brooms are seen to ride  The Lapland wizzard and his hellish bride  There on a sledge the raindeer drives the swain  To meet his mistress on the frostbound plain  Have mercy Winterfor we own thy power  Thy flooding deluge and thy drenching shower  Yeswe acknowledge what thy prowess can  But oh have pity on the toil of man  And tho' the floods thy adamantine chain  Submissive wearyet spare the treasur'd grain  The peasants to thy mercy now resign  The infant seedtheir hope and future mine  Not always Phoebus bends his vengeful bow  Oft in mid winter placid breezes blow  Oft tinctur'd with the bluest transmarine  The fretted canopy of heaven is seen  Girded with argent lamps the fullorb'd moon  In mild December emulates the noon  Tho' short the respite if the saphire blue  Stains the bright lustre with an inky hue  Then a black wreck of clouds is seen to fly  In broken shatters thro' the frighted sky  But if fleet Eurus scour the vaulted plain  Then all the stars propitious shine again  Like Myra's face appears the vivid scene  And like her mind free open and serene  ODE TO WINTER  BY A GENTLEMAN OF CAMBRIDGE  FRom mountains of eternal snow  And Zembla's dreary plains  Where the bleak winds for ever blow  And Frost for ever reigns  Lo Winter comes in fogs array'd  With ice and spangled dews  To dews and fogs and storms be paid  The tribute of the Muse  Each flowery carpet Nature spread  Is vanish'd from the eye  Where'er unhappy lovers tread  No Philomel is nigh  For well I ween her plaintive note  Can soothing ease impart  The little warblings of her throat  Relieve the wounded heart  No blushing rose unfolds its bloom  No tender lillies blow  To scent the air with rich perfume  Or grace Lucinda's brow  Th' indulgent Father who protects  The wretched and the poor  With the same gracious care directs  The sparrow to our door  Dark scowling tempests rend the skies  And clouds obscure the day  His genial warmth the sun denies  And sheds a fainter ray  Yet blame we not the troubled air  Or seek defects to find  For Power Omnipotent is there  And 'walks upon the wind'  Hail every pair' whom love unites  In wedlock's pleasing ties  That endless source of pure delights  That blessing to the wise  Tho' yon pale orb no warmth bestows  And storms united meet  The flame of love and friendship glows  With unextinguish'd heat  TO WINTER  BY MR WOTY  WHat tho' thou com'st in sable mantle clad  Yet Winter art thou welcome to my eye  Thee here I hail tho' terrors round thee wait  And winds tempestuous howl along the sky  But shall I then so soon forget the days  When Ceres led me thro' her wheaten mines  When Autumn pluck'd me with his tawny hand  Empurpled clusters from ambrosial vines  So soon forget when up the yielding pole  I saw ascend the silverbearded hop  When Summer waving high her crown of hay  Pour'd o'er the mead her odoriferous crop  I must forget themand thee too O Spring  Tho' many a chaplet thou hast weav'd for me  For now prepar'd to quit th' enchanting scenes  Cold weeping Winter I come all to thee  Hail to thy rolling clouds and rapid storms  Tho' they deform fair Nature's lovely face  Hail to thy winds that sweep along the earth  Tho' trees they root up from their solid base  How sicklied over is the face of things  Where is the spicekiss of the southern gale  Where the wild rose that smil'd upon the thorn  The mountain flower and lilly of the vale  How gloomy 'tis to cast the eye around  And view the trees disrob'd of every leaf  The velvet path grown rough with clotting showers  And every field depriv'd of every sheaf  How far more gloomy o'er the rainbeat heath  Alone to travel in the dead of night  No twinkling star to gild the arch of heaven  No moon to lend her temporary light  To see the lightning spread its ample sheet  Discern the wild waste thro' its liquid fire  To hear the thunder rend the troubled air  As time itself and nature would expire  And yet O Winter has thy poet seen  Thy face as smooth and placid as the Spring  Has felt with comfort felt the beam of heaven  And heard thy vallies and thy woodlands ring  What time the sun with burnish'd locks arose  The long lost charms of nature to renew  When pearls of ice bedeck'd the grassy turf  And treetops floated in the silver dew  Father of heaven and earth this change is thine  By thee the Seasons in gradation roll  Thou great omniscient Ruler of the world  Thou Alpha and Omega of the whole  Here humbly bow we down our heads to thee  'Tis ours the voice of gratitude to raise  Thine to diffuse thy blessings o'er the land  Thine to receive the incense of our praise  Pure if it rises from the conscious heart  With thee for ever does the symbol live  Tho' small for all thy love is man's return  Thou ask'st no more than he has power to give  ON THE FIFTH OF DECEMBER BEING THE BIRTHDAY OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY  HAil eldest of the monthly train  Sire of the winter drear  December in whose iron reign  Expires the chequer'd year  Hush all the blustering blasts that blow  And proudly plum'd in silver snow  Smile gladly on this blest of days  The liveried clouds shall on thee wait  And Phoebus shine in all his state  With more than summer rays  Tho' jocund June may justly boast  Long days and happy hours  Tho' August be Pomona's host  And May be crown'd with flowers  Tell June his fire and crimson dies  By Harriot's blush and Harriot's eyes  Eclips'd and vanquish'd fade away  Tell August thou canst let him see  A richer riper fruit than he  A sweeter flower than May  DEATH A POEM  BY THE LATE CHARLES EMILY ESQ  THE festive roar of laughter the warm glow  Of briskeyed joy and friendship's genial bowl  Wit's season'd converse and the liberal flow  Of unsuspicious youth profuse of soul  Delight not ever from the boisterous scene  Of riot far and Comus' wild uproar  From folly's crowd whose vacant brow serene  Was never knit to wisdom's frowning lore  Permit me ye timehallow'd domes ye piles  Of rude magnificence your solemn rest  Amid your fretted vaults and lengthening isles  Lonely to wander no unholy guest  That means to break with sacrilegious tread  The marble slumbers of your monumented dead  Permit me with sad musings that inspire  Unlabour'd numbers apt your silence drear  Blameless to wake and with th' Orphean lyre  Fitly attemper'd sooth the merciless ear  Of Hades and stern Death whose iron sway  Great Nature owns thro' all her wide domain  All that with oary fin cleave their smooth way  Thro' the green bosom of the spawny main  And those that to the streaming ether spread  In many a wheeling glide their feathery sail  And those that creep and those that statelier tread  That roam o'er forest hill or browsed dale  The victims each of ruthless fate must fall  Even God's own image man high paramount of all  And ye the young the giddy and the gay  That startle from the sleepful lid of light  The curtain'd rest and with the dissonant bray  Of Bacchus and loud Jollity affright  Yon radiant goddess that now shoots among  Those many window'd isles her glimmering beam  Know that or e'er its starr'd career along  Thrice shall have roll'd her silverywheeled team  Some parent breast may heave the answering sigh  To the slow pauses of the funeral knell  E'en now black Atropos with scouling eye  Roars in the laugh and revels o'er the bowl  E'en now in rosycrowned pleasure's wreath  Entwines in adder folds allunsuspected Death  Know on the stealing wing of time shall flee  Some few some shortliv'd years and all is past  A future bard these awful domes may see  Muse o'er the present age as I the last  Who mouldering in the grave yet once like you  The various maze of life were seen to tread  Each bent their own peculiar to pursue  As custom urg'd or wilful nature led  Mix'd with the various crouds inglorious clay  The nobler virtues undistinguish'd lie  No more to melt with beauty's heavenborn ray  No more to wet compassion's tearful eye  Catch from the poet raptures not their own  And feel the thrilling melody of sweet renown  Where is the masterhand whose semblant art  Chissel'd the marble into life or taught  From the wellpencill'd portraiture to start  The nerve that beat with soul the brow that thought  Cold are the fingers that in stonefixt trance  The mute attention rivetting to the lyre  Struck language dimm'd the poet's quickeyed glance  All in wild raptures flashing heaven's own fire▪  Shrunk is the sinew'd energy that strung  The warrior arm where sleeps the patriot breast  Whilom that heav'd impassion'd Where the tongue  That lanc'd its lightning o'er the towering crest  Of scepter'd Insolence and overthrew  Giant Oppression leagued with all her earthborn crew  These now are past long long ye fleeting years  Pursue with glory wing'd your fated way  Ere from the womb of time unwelcome peers  The dawn of that inevitable day  When wrapt in shrouded clay their warmest friend  The widow'd virtues shall again deplore  When o'er his urn in pious grief shall bend  His Britain and bewail one Patriot more  For soon must Thou too soon who spread'st abroad  Thy beaming emanations unconfin'd  Doom'd like some better angel sent of God  To scatter blessings over humankind  Thou too must fall O Pitt to shine no more  And tread these deathful paths a Faulkland trod before  Fast to the driving winds the marshall'd clouds  Sweep discontinuous o'er th' etherial plain  Another still upon another crouds  All hastenihg downward to their native main  Thus passes o'er thro' varied life's career  Man's fleeting age the Seasons as they fly  Snatch from us in their course year after year  Some sweet connection some endearing tie  The parent everhonour'd everdear  Claims from the filial breast the pious sigh  A brother's urn demands the kindred tear  And gentle sorrows gush from friendship's eye  Today we frolic in the rosy bloom  Of jocund youthThe morrow knells us to the tomb  Who knows how soon in this sepulchral spot  Shall heaven to me the drear abode assign  How soon the past irrevocable lot  Of these that rest beneath me shall be mine  Haply when Zephyr to thy native bourn  Shall waft thee o'er the storm'd Hibernian wave  Thy gentle breast my Tavistock shall mourn  To find me sleeping in the senseless grave  No more the social leisure to divide  In the sweet intercourse of soul and soul  Blithe or of graver brow no more to chide  The lingering years impatient as they roll  Till all thy cultur'd virtues shall display  Fullblossom'd their bright honours to the gazing day  Ah dearest youth these vows perhaps unheard  The rude wind scatters o'er the billowy main  These prayers at friendship's holy shrine preferr'd  May rise to grasp their father's knees in vain  Soon soon may nod the sad funereal plume  With solemn horror o'er thy timeless hearse  And I survive to grave upon thy tomb  The mournful tribute of memorial verse  That leave to Heaven's decisionBe it thine  Higher than yet a parent's wishes flew  To soar in bright preeminence and shine  With selfearn'd honours eager to pursue  Where glory with her clear unsullied rays  The wellborn spirit lights to deeds of mightiest praise  Twas she thy godlike Russell's bosom steel'd  With confidence untam'd in his last breath  Sternsmiling She with calm composure held  The patriot axe of Sidney edg'd with death  Smit with the warmth of her impulsive flame  Wolfe's gallant virtue flies to worlds afar  Emulous to pluck fresh wreaths of wellearn'd fame  From the grim frowning brow of laurell'd war  'Twas she that on the morn of direful birth  Bared thy young bosom to the fatal blow  Lamented Armytagethe bleeding youth  O bathe him in the pearly caves below  Ye Nereids and ye Nymphs of Camus hoar  Weepfor ye oft have seen him on your haunted shore  Better to die with glory than recline  On the soft lap of ignominious peace  Than yawn out the dull droning life supine  In Monkish apathy and Gowned ease  Better employ'd in honour's bright career  The least division on the dial's round  Than thrice to compass Saturn's livelong year  Grown old in sloth the burthen of the ground  Than tug with sweating toil the slavish oar  Of unredeem'd affliction and sustain  The feverous rage of fierce diseases sore  Unnumber'd that in sympathetic chain  Hang ever thro' the sick circumfluous air  All from the drizzly verge of yonder stargirt sphere  Thick in the manybeaten road of life  A thousand maladies are posted round  With wretched man to wage eternal strife  Unseen like ambush'd Indians till they wound  There the swollen Hydrops stands the watery Rheum  The northern Scurvy blotch with leperous scale  And moping ever in the cloister'd gloom  Of learned sloth the bookish Asthma pale  And the shun'd hag unsightly that ordain'd  On Europe's sons to wreak the faithless sword  Of Cortez with the blood of millions stain'd  O'er dogeyed Lust the torturing scourge abhorr'd  Shakes threatening since the while she wing'd her flight  From Amazon's broad wave and Andes' snowclad height  Where the wan daughter of the yellow year  The chattering Ague chill the writhing Stone  And he of ghastly feature on whose ear  Unheeded croaks the deathbird's warning moan  Marasmus knotty Gout and the dead life  Of nerveless Palsy there on purpose fell  Dark brooding whets his interdicted knife  Grim Suicide the damned fiend of hell  There too is the stunn'd Apoplexy pight  Placed    The bloated child of gorg'd Intemperance foul  Selfwasting Melancholy black as night  Lowering and foaming fierce with hideous howl  The dog Hydrophoby and near allied  Scar'd Madness with her moonstruck eyeballs staring wide  There stretch'd One huge beneath the rocky mine  Alluding to the earthquake at Lisbon  With boiling sulphur fraught and smouldering fires  He the dread delegate of wrath divine  E'er while that stood o'er Taio's hundred spires  Vindictive thrice he wav'd th' earthshaking wand  Powerful as that the Son of Amron bore  And thrice he rais'd and thrice he check'd his hand  He struck the rocking ground with thunderous roar  Yawn'd here from street to street hurries and there  Now runs now stops then shrieks and scours amain  Staring Distraction many a palace fair  With millions sinks ingulpht and pillar'd fane  Old Ocean's farthest waves confest the shock  Even Albion trembled conscious on his stedfast rock  The meagre Famine there and drunk with blood  Stern War and the loath'd monster whom of yore  The slimy Naiad of the Memphian flood  Engendering to the brighthair'd Phoebus bore  Foul Pestilence that on the wide stretch'd wings  Of commerce speeds from Cairo's swarthy bay  His westering flight and thro' the sick air flings  Spotted Contagion at heels Dismay  And Desolation urge their firewheel'd yoke  Terrible as long of old when from the height  Of Paran came unwrath'd the Mightiest shook  Earth's firm fix'd base tottering thro' the black night  Glanc'd the flash'd lightnings heaven's rent roof abroad  Thunder'd and universal Nature felt its God  Who on that scene of terror on that hour  Of roused indignation shall withstand  Th' Almighty when he meditates to shower  The bursting vengeance o'er a guilty land  Canst thou secure in reason's vaunted pride  Tonguedoughty miscreant who but now didst gore  With more than Hebrew rage the innocent side  Of agonizing mercy bleeding sore  Canst thou confront with stedfast eye unaw'd  The sworded Judgment stalking far and near  Well may'st thou tremble when an injur'd God  Disclaims theeguilt is ever quick of fear  Loud whirlwinds howl in Zephyr's softest breath  And every glancing meteor glares imagin'd death  The good alone are fearlessthey alone  Firm and collected in their virtue brave  The wreck of worlds and look unshrinking down  On the dread yawnings of the ravenous grave  Thrice happy who the blameless road along  Of honest praise hath reach'd the vale of death  Around him like ministrant Cherubs throng  His Better Actions to the parting breath  Singing their blessed requiems he the while  Gently reposing on some friendly breast  Breaths out his benizons then with a smile  Of soft complacence lays him down to rest  Calm as the slumbering infant from the goal  Free and unbounded flies the disembodied soul  Whether some delegated charge below  Some muchlov'd friend its hovering care may claim  Whether it homeward soars again to know  That long forgotten country whence it came  Conjecture ever the misfeatur'd child  Of letter'd arrogance delights to run  Thro' speculation's puzzling mazes wild  And all to end at last where it begun  Fain would we trace with reason's erring clue  The darksome paths of destiny aright  In vain the task were easier to pursue  The trackless wheeling of the swallow's flight  From mortal ken himself the Almighty shrouds  Pavilion'd in thick night and circumambient clouds  THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  A CAMBRIDGE PRIZE POEM IN MDCCLVII  BY R GLYNN MD  THY justice heavenly King and that great day  When virtue long abandon'd and forlorn  Shall raise her pensive head and vice that erst  Rang'd unreprov'd and free shall sink appall'd  I sing adventurousBut what eye can pierce  The vast immeasurable realms of space  O'er which Messiah drives his flaming car  To that bright region where enthron'd He sits  Firstborn of heaven to judge assembled worlds  Cloath'd in celestial radiance Can the Muse  Her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew  Soar to that bright empyreal where around  Myriads of angels God's perpetual choir  Hymn hallelujahs and in concert loud  Chant songs of triumph to their Maker's praise  Yet will I strive to sing albeit unus'd  To tread poetic soil What tho' the wiles  Of Fancy me enchanted ne'er could lure  To rove o'er fairy lands to swim the streams  That thro' her valleys weave their mazy way  Or climb her mountain tops yet will I raise  My feeble voice to tell what harmony  Sweet as the music of the rolling spheres  Attunes the moral world that virtue still  May hope her promis'd crown that vice may dread  Vengeance tho' late that reasoning pride may own  Just tho' unsearchable the ways of heaven  Sceptic whoe'er thou art who say'st the soul  That particle divine which God's own breath  Inspir'd into the mortal mass shall rest  Annihilate till duration has unroll'd  Her neverending line tell if thou know'st  Why every nation every clime tho' all  In laws in rites in manners disagree  With one content expect another world  Where wickedness shall weep why Paynim bards  Fabled Elysian plains Tartarean lakes  Styx and Cocytos tell why Hali's sons  Have feign'd a paradise of mirth and love  Banquets and blooming Nymphs or rather tell  Why on the brink of Orellana's stream  Where never Science rear'd her sacred torch  Th' untutor'd Indian dreams of happier worlds  Behind the cloudtopt hill why in each breast  Is plac'd a friendly monitor that prompts  Informs directs encourages forbids  Tell why on unknown evil grief attends  Or joy on secret good Why conscience acts  With tenfold force when sickness age or pain  Stands tottering on the precipice of death  Or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul  Of dying sinners while the good man sleeps  Peaceful and calm and with a smile expires  Look round the world with what a partial hand  The scale of bliss and misery is sustain'd  Beneath the shade of cold obscurity  Pale Virtue lies no arm supports her head  No friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul  Nor softeyed Pity drops a melting tear  But in their stead Contempt and rude Disdain  Insult the banish'd wanderer on the goes  Neglected and forlorn disease and cold  And famine worst of ills her steps attend  Yet patient and to heaven's just will resign'd  She ne'er is seen to weep or heard to sigh  Now turn your eyes to yon sweetsmelling bower  Where flush'd with all the insolence of wealth  Sits pamper'd Vice for him th' Arabian gale  Breathes forth delicious odours Gallia's hills  For him pour nectar from the purple vine  Nor think for these he pays the tribute due  To heaven of heaven he never names the name  Save when with imprecations dark and dire  He points his jest obscene Yet buxom Health  Sits on his rosy cheek yet Honour gilds  His high exploits and downypinion'd Sleep  Sheds a soft opiate o'er his peaceful couch  See'st thou this righteous Father see'st thou this  And wilt thou ne'er repay shall good and ill  Be carried undistinguish'd to the land  Where all things are forgotAh no the day  Will come when Virtue from the cloud shall burst  That long obscur'd her beams when Sin shall fly  Back to her native hell there sink eclips'd  In penal darkness where nor star shall rise  Nor ever sunshine pierce th' impervious gloom  On that great day the solemn trump shall sound  That trump which once in heaven on man's revolt  Convok'd th' astonish'd seraphs at whose voice  Th' unpeopled graves shall pour forth all their dead  Then shall th' assembled nations of the earth  From every quarter at the judgmentseat  Unite Egyptians Babylonians Greeks  Parthians and they who dwelt on Tyber's banks  Names fam'd of old or who of later age  Chinese and Russian Mexican and Turk  Tenant the wide terrene and they who pitch  Their tents on Niger's banks or where the sun  Pours on Golconda's spires his early light  Drink Ganges' sacred stream At once shall rise  Whom distant ages to each others sight  Had long denied before the throne shall kneel  Some great Progenitor while at his side  Stands his descendant thro' a thousand lines  Whate'er their nation and whate'er their rank  Heroes and patriarchs slaves and sceptred kings  With equal eye the God of All shall see  And judge with equal love What tho' the great  With costly pomp and aromatic sweets  Embalm'd his poor remains or thro' the dome  A thousand tapers shed their gloomy light  While solemn organs to his parting soul  Chanted slow orisons say by what mark  Do'st thou discern him from that lowly swain  Whose mouldering bones beneath the thornbound turf  Long lay neglectedAll at once shall rise  But not to equal glory for alas  With howlings dire and execrations loud  Some wail their fatal birthFirst among these  Behold the mighty murtherers of mankind  They who in sport whole kingdoms slew or they  Who to the tottering pinnacle of power  Waded thro' seas of blood how will they curse  The madness of ambition how lament  Their dearbought laurels when the widow'd wife  And childless mother at the judgmentseat  Plead trumpettongu'd against themHere are they  Who sunk an aged father to the grave  Or with unkindness hard and cold disdain  Slighted a brother's sufferingsHere are they  Whom fraud and skilful treachery long secur'd  Who from the infant virgin tore her dower  And eat the orphan's breadwho spent their stores  In selfish luxury or o'er their gold  Prostrate and pale ador'd the useless heap  Here too who stain'd the chaste connubial bed  Who mix'd the poisonous bowlor broke the ties  Of hospitable friendshipAnd the wretch  Whose listless soul sick with the cares of life  Unsummon'd to the presence of his God  Rush'd in with insult rude How would they joy  Once more to visit earth and tho' oppress'd  With all that pain or famine can inflict  Pant up the hill of life vain wish the Judge  Pronounces doom eternal on their heads  Perpetual punishment Seek not to know  What punishment for that th' Almighty Will  Has hid from mortal eyes And shall vain man  With curious search refin'd presume to pry  Into thy secrets Father no let him  With humble patience all thy works adore  And walk in all thy paths so shall his meed  Be great in heaven so haply shall he 'scape  Th' immortal worm and neverceasing fire  But who are they who bound in tenfold chains  Stand horribly aghast this is that crew  Who strove to pull Jehovah from his throne  And in the place of heaven's eternal King  Set up the phantom Chance For them in vain  Alternate seasons cheer'd the rolling year  In vain the sun o'er herb tree fruit and flower  Shed genial influence mild and the pale moon  Repair'd her waning orbNext these is plac'd  The vile blasphemer he whose impious wit  Profan'd the sacred mysteries of faith  And 'gainst th' impenetrable walls of heaven  Planted his feeble batteryBy these stands  The archApostate He with many a wile  Exhorts them still to foul revolt Alas  No hope have they from black despair no ray  Shines thro' the gloom to cheer their sinking souls  In agonies of grief they curse the hour  When first they left Religion's onward way  These on the left are rang'd but on the right  A chosen band appears who fought beneath  The banner of Jehovah and defied  Satan's united legions Some unmov'd  At the grim tyrant's frown o'er barbarous climes  Diffus'd the gospel's light Some long immur'd  Sad servitude in chains and dungeons pin'd  Or rack'd with all the agonies of pain  Breath'd out their faithful lives Thrice happy they  Whom heaven elected to that glorious strife  Here are they plac'd whose kind munificence  Made heavenborn Science raise her drooping head  And on the labours of a future race  Entail'd their just rewardThou amongst these  Good  The gentleman who by will left an annual premium to the author of the best poem on some divine subject who must be MA of Cambridge  Seaton whose welljudg'd benevolence  Fostering fair genius bad the poet's hand  Bring annual offerings to his Maker's shrine  Shalt find the generous care was not in vain  Here is that favourite band whom mercy mild  God's best lov'd attribute adorn'd whose gate  Stood ever open to the stranger's call  Who fed the hungry to the thirsty lip  Reach'd out the friendly cup whose care benign  From the rude blast secur'd the pilgrim's side  Who heard the widow's tender tale and shook  The galling shackle from the prisoners feet  Who each endearing tie each office knew  Of meekeyed heavendescended Charity  O Charity thou Nymph divinely fair  Sweeter than those whom antient poets bound  In Amity's indissoluble chain  The Graces how shall I essay to paint  Thy charms celestial Maid and in rude verse  Blazon those deeds thy self didst ne'er reveal  For thee nor rankling Envy can infect  Nor rage transport nor high o'erweening Pride  Puff up with vain conceit ne'er didst thou smile  To see the sinner as a verdant tree  Spread his luxuriant branches o'er the stream  While like some blasted trunk the righteous fall  Prostrate forlornWhen prophecies shall fail  When tongues shall cease when knowledge is no more  And this great day is come thou by the throne  Shalt sit triumphantThither lovely Maid  Bear me Oh bear me on thy soaring wing  And thro' the adamantine gates of heaven  Conduct my steps safe from the fiery gulph  And dark abyss where Sin and Satan reign  But can the Muse her numbers all too weak  Tell how that restless element of fire  Shall wage with seas and earth intestine war  And deluge all creation Whether so  Some think the comet as thro' fields of air  Lawless he wanders shall rush headlong on  Thwarting th' ecliptic where th' unconscious earth  Rolls in her wonted course whether the sun  With force centripetal into his orb  Attract her long reluctant or the caves  Those dread volcanos where engendering lie  Sulphureous minerals from their dark abyss  Pour streams of liquid fire while from above  As erst on Sodom heaven's avenging hand  Rains fierce combustionWhere are now the works  Of art the toil of ages Where are now  Th' imperial cities sepulchres and domes  Trophies and pillarsWhere is Egypt's boast  Those lofty pyramids which high in air  Rear'd their aspiring heads to distant times  Of Memphian pride a lasting monument  Tell me where Athens rais'd her towersWhere Thebes  Open'd her hundred portalsTell me where  Stood seagirt AlbionWhere imperial Rome  Propt by seven hills sat like a sceptred queen  And aw'd the tributary world to peace  Shew me the rampart which o'er many a hill  Thro' many a valley stretch'd its wide extent  Rais'd by that mighty monarch to repel  The roving Tartar when with insult rude  'Gainst Pekin's towers he bent th' unerring bow  But what is mimic Art even Nature's works  Seas meadows pastures the meandring streams  And everlasting hills shall be no more  No more shall Teneriff cloudpiercing height  O'erhang th' Atlantic surgeNor that fam'd cliff  Thro' which the Persian steer'd with many a sail  Throw to the Lemnian isle its evening shade  O'er half the wide AegaeanWhere are now  The Alps that confin'd with unnumber'd realms  And from the Black Sea to the Ocean stream  Stretch'd their extended armsWhere's Ararat  That hill on which the faithful Patriarch's ark  Which seven long months had voyag'd o'er its top  First rested when the earth with all her sons  As now by streaming cataracts of fire  Was whelm'd by mighty watersAll at once  Are vanish'd and dissolv'd no trace remains  No mark of vain distinction heaven itself  That azure vault with all those radiant orbs  Sinks in the universal ruin lost  No more shall planets round their central sun  Move in harmonious dance no more the moon  Hang out her silver lamp and those fix'd stars  Spangling the golden canopy of night  Which oft the Tuscan with his optic glass  Call'd from their wonderous height to read their names  And magnitude some winged minister  Shall quench and surest sign that all on earth  Is lost shall rend from heaven the mystic bow  Such is that awful that tremendous day  Whose coming who shall tell for as a thief  Unheard unseen it steals with silent pace  Thro' night's dark gloomPerhaps as here I sit  And rudely carol these incondite lays  Soon shall the hand be check'd and dumb the mouth  That lisps the faultering strainO may it ne'er  Intrude unwelcome on an illspent hour  But find me wrapt in meditations high  Hymning my great Creator "Power supreme  " O everlasting King to Thee I kneel  " To Thee I lift my voice With fervent heat  " Melt all ye elements and thou high heaven  " Shrink like a shrivell'd scrollBut think O Lord  " Think on the best the noblest of thy works  " Think on thine own bright image think on Him  " Who died to save us from thy righteous wrath  " And 'midst the wreck of worlds remember man"  TO FAME AN ODE  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXXXIX  LO on yon promontory's pendent brow  That threats the shadow'd gulph below  In the dun air sublime  Fame spreads her hasty pinions wide  Disdaining Britain's sluggish clime  And in a moment's flight  Determines to alight  On active Gaul's more formidable side  Stay Goddess I conjure thee stay  And ere irrevocably soar'd away  Thy piercing trump apply  And pour so vehement a blast  As shall alarm earth sea and sky  Amaze the present age and echo to the last  She hears the Muse's call  And with obedient breath  Inspires the mystic strain  Hark hark the swelling sound  Tempests the air around  Rouses the sleeping main  Shakes earth's remotest bound  Pierces the very centre of the ball  And almost wakens death  Again again th' upbraiding peal renew  Make courtly Deafness hear  Make tyrant Power and base Corruption fear  The Furies close their guilty steps pursue  Again again it rushes loud  As thunder from a bursting cloud  The distant Russians catch the fierce alarm  And fir'd with martial flame  Luxurious Persians arm  And bravely emulate the Greek and Roman name  But death to honest eyes  Britannia's Genius slumbering lies  Effeminately soft on carpets spread  Deaf to the honourable sound  That kindles virtue thro' the world's vast round

needless aid  Of studious art dear lovely maid  Vainly from side to side forbear  To shift thy glass and braid each straggling hair  As the gay flowers which nature yields  Spontaneous on the verdant fields  Delight the fancy more than those  Which gardens trim arrange in equal rows  As tho pure rill whose mazy train  The prattling pebbles check in vain  Gives native pleasures while it leads  Its random waters winding thro' the meads  As birds the groves and streams among  In artless strains the vernal song  Warbling their woodnotes wild repeat  And sooth the ear irregularly sweet  So simple dress and native grace  Will best become thy lovely face  For naked Cupid still suspects  In artful ornaments conceal'd defects  Cease then with idlycruel care  To torture thus thy flowing hair  O cease with tasteless toil to shed  A cloud of scented dust around thy head  Not Berenice's locks could boast  A grace like thine among the host  Of stars tho' radiant now they rise  And add new lustre to the spangled skies  Nor Venus when her charms divine  Improving in a form like thine  She gave her tresses unconfin'd  To wave around her neck and wanton in the wind  THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL AN ARGUMENT OF ITS IMMORTALITY  BY THE SAME  INSCRIBED TO DR THOMAS HERRING LORD ARCH OF CANT MAY MDCCL  SO oft indulg'd the philosophic Muse  Again my lord for your protection sues  Small her pretensions who no merit knows  But what th' importance of her theme bestows  Oh could her verse attain that happy art  Which charms persuades and melts the human heart  That grace that warmth that energy divine  Which in your language looks and gesture shine  When truths sublime you cloath in radiant dress  And heav'n's commands on listning crowds impress  Smooth then would flow each modulated

divine from which they flow'd  And of his creatures rational require  A hymn of praise to their allgracious sire  To tame the barren earth by toil and skill  Raise the low stream and sink the lofty hill  The soul first taught and o'er the mounting tide  Borne by the winds in floating forts to ride  From various climes to bring their various store  Silver and gold from rich Peruvia's shore  Spices and pearls from realms of dawning day  While Persia's costly silks our limbs array  By letters we converse with every sage  That grac'd the Grecian or the Roman age  Hence in the sacred academic grove  With Plato and with Xenophon we rove  At Tusculum attend to Tully's tongue  Of truth and virtue while he reasons strong  By letters with our knowledge we adorn  And teach our arts to nations yet unborn  Thus foremost in the learned train shall stand  Newton and Clarke in each politer land  The mind with numberless ideas fraught  Exerts by memory each latent thought  Till her frail casket moulders into clay  And every fair impression fades away  To pleasing objects boundless fancy roves  And charm'd with cooling springs or shady groves  With ready pencil paints each rural scene  The mossy fountain or the level green  Thus Eden's bowers in Milton gaily bloom  Here fragrant gales the balmy air perfume  There the great artist's lively tints have drawn  The tufted thicket and the verdant lawn  Hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains  Joy here unmix'd with cares and sorrows reigns  Warble the birds along the flowing stream  The bounding fish reflect the golden beam  Here shines each lovely flower there fountains play  Or gliding rivers in meanders stray  And to each plant refreshing streams dispense  While fruits and blossoms charm the various sense  The boughs at once both fruits and blossoms bear  With flavour please the taste with fragrance  the air  The fleeting race of flowers not wholly dead  Revive in spring and wave the dewy head  In spring once more the virgin lillies blow  Whitening the vales with vegetable snow  In spring the varied tulips paint the field  Tho' to the rigour of the year they yield  Bound up by winter's frost and must this span  This dream of life comprise the whole of man  For better ends th' Almighty wise and good  With such high faculties the soul endued  The steady judgment's penetrating eye  Into th' abyss of future times can pry  And some have made the prophet's praise their own  For things to come by past and present known  Tiresias thus and Phineus sages old  The secrets of futurity foretold  Their outward eyes tho' clos'd in endless night  Were amply recompens'd by mental light  Rais'd by philosophy from narrow earth  The soul heavenborn asserts her heavenly birth  On Contemplation's wing she boldly flies  And claims acquaintance with her native skies  Can there each sun each peopled world behold  Thro' space immense with course unerring roll'd  Their periods distance size eclipses knows  And why the sea alternate ebbs and flows  Can measure even the speed of solar light  Than which thought only boasts a swifter flight  Soars like a seraph unconfin'd by sense  To grasp the wonders of Omnipotence  But higher still ascends the moral soul  Nor can corporeal forms her search controul  By this th' Almighty's attributes we trace  And ponder time eternity and space  By this are taught our follies to restrain  To curb our passions with a streighten'd rein  And imitate the bounteous power above  In justice goodness purity and love  But will the wise Creator throw away  Such talents on the creature of a day  A creature which to virtue's heights can soar  And drinking deep of knowledge thirsts for more  Shall he cut off from life no more to bloom  For ever sleep forgotten in the tomb  Or may we not with humble hope conclude  That since with such prerogatives endued  Our heavenly Sire will bid his image rise  To happier seats an inmate of the skies  DR SAMUEL BARROW'S LATIN

day  But see to end this impious war  Ordain'd Messiah's ensigns blaze from far  Selfmov'd his rushing chariot rolls  And shakes with whirlwind sound th' eternal poleo  From living wheels true

foulest dye  Repine and Lust and all the savage train  Retire abash'd before thy holy eye  With silver hair brightflowing in the east  And rubytinctur'd mantle lightly spread  With pearlbestudded girdle bound her vest  Aurora rises from her coral bed  I feel her sweet breath in the balmy gale  Purging from noxious fumes the humid air  Shedding fresh odours on the flowery vale  And genuine roses on the village fair  I see the dappled fleece her favourite woof  And goldenfringed clouds adorn the sky  Skimming with light wing o'er its azure roof  And softening every object to the eye  While yet the mind retains her tranquil ease  From day's perplexing cares and passions free  While Nature's charms are best array'd to please  And Health and Pleasure join in amity  Oft let me rove beneath thy gentle beam  Ere sultry Phoebus mounts his burning throne  And to the soaring skylark's grateful theme  In numbers less melodious join my own  And as I range th' ambrosial fields along  Or climb the verdant hills unshaded height  Pause on those blessings that inspire my song  And gather thence instruction and delight  Springs not a blade upon the spacious plain  Bends not a flower beneath the crystal tear  Chirps not an insect of the turf in vain  But Contemplation Wisdom's voice can hear  See yonder feather'd parent skimming round  Sudden she darts upon her humble food  Yet

plan  He feeds his follies and neglects his race  What sudden burst of oriental rays  Disturbs the peaceful musings of my breast  Involves the ample firmament in blaze  And shoots its glories to the distant west  How bright the scene magnificent and large  The orb of light reveals his glorious face  Rejoicing in his high Creator's charge  To spread his bounties thro' the realms of space  Fitted to mortal eye thy splendors mild  More great appear than at meridian height  So shone the holy Virgin's heavenly child  Disclosing grace divine to human sight  In prime advancing now the jocund day  Laughs in the fulness of unclouded joy  Freshspringing flowrets strew his radiant way  The woodland harmonists their notes employ  From hill to dale from grove to verd'rous spring  Sweet sounds responsive fill the ambient air  Sweet sounds responsive make the valleys ring  And banish thence the family of care  Nor cheerless is the herd's majestic low  Loudcalling for the milkmaid's easing hand  Or white slocks bleating on the mountain's brow  Or plowman's whistling o'er his furrow'd land  Ye blest inhabitants of fields and shades  Elysium soft of undisturb'd repose  No artificial want your breast invades  No painful foretaste of succeeding woes  By simple instinct led to you unknown  The tender throb of exquisite desire  The wealth of Avarice and Ambition's throne  No raging wish no discontent inspire  To you sufficing that the genial beam  Of day's enlivening planet wakes to joy  Satiate ye quaff the pure untainted stream  And feast on dainties that can never cloy  O to my heart your sacred lore convey  Let Nature be my wealth my joy my guide  And be the business of each rising day  To check my wants my passions and my pride  AN EVENING ELEGY  WElcome thou sober evening

She pensiveplodding sits with downcast air  Refusing rest her fraudful plan to draw  Pursuing which nor Themis' righteous lore  Nor precious relatives bloodbinding tie  Nor all that heaven for virtue has in store  Can draw aside her Mammonfixed eye  O'er rocks and seas unheeded bounds she flies  Explores the cold extreme of either Pole  Dares the fierce heats of equinoctial skies  Nor slacks her race till Death's unwelcome goal  Far from my breast kind heaven such lust remove  At every grateful tranquil eve's return  Let me while doubtful Cynthia cheers the grove  With naught but love or pious ardor burn  And as along some placid stream I range  Viewing the wild flowers close their gaudy bloom  Or birds the free expanse of ether change  To seek the shady covert's inmost gloom  Ah let me tread with cautious step and slow  Where thickset hawthorns shed their odours wide  Where intermingled roses sweetly blow  And rambling woodbines cling on every side  Perchance within the fragrant thicket hid  Some tuneful warbler rests his wearied throat  Who ere the sun beneath th' horizon slid  Had sooth'd my bosom with his dulcet note  Perchance closeperch'd aside his brooding mate  With bill to bill inclin'd in silent joy  He cheers her lonely hours and watchful state  And cares lest aught should her repose destroy  Sweet harmonists your tender vigils keep  Secure for me I will not do ye wrong  The rustling boughs my garments shall not sweep  And ye shall pay me with your future song  But hark what voice the sacred stillness breaks  Softer than silence are those melting strains  Or lover's sighs when pleading Nature speaks  'Tis sadlypleasing Philomel complains  Long let me drink the magic of thy lay  Nor humming chafers baulk my thirsty ear  The time insensibly shall wear away  Till night approach and every star appear  Then as my lagging feet I homewards draw  My passions all in heavenly concord bound  The solemn scene shall fill my soul with awe  And God Omnipotent my tongue resound  Methinks when clad in beaming glories mild  Full and majestic shines the queen of night  Around her throne innumerous squadrons fil'd  Of hosts celestial ministers of light  It should remind us of that holy hour  When heaven and earth's allgracious Judge shall come  In the full splendor of his Father's power  With guard seraphic to pronounce our doom  May I when life's short day begins to close  The star of age paleglimmering o'er my head  Unvex'd by troublous blast my mind compose  Nor fortune's frowns nor sacred vengeance dread  From every anxious busy scene retir'd  Let me the world's mad tumult view from far  Smile at what erst each raging passion fir'd  Nor deem short pleasure worth unceasing care  Within some humblydecent rural shed  There let my sun of life in radiance set  Thro' smiling hope when Death's black night is sled  A course more glorious shall its orient wait  FRIENDSHIP  ATTEMPTED AFTER THE MANNER OF COWLEY  FRiendship how sweet how comely dost thou seem  But art thou aught indeed besides a dream  A pleasing dream where mines of wealth we own  But by distress awak'd we find our comfort flown  Yet have I read amongst the poets tales  What mighty things have been by friendship done  Or if the world of fiction naught avails  View Israel's royal youth and Jesse's son  Their love above the love of women rose  Etherial flame purg'd from each grosser fire  Their bosoms throb'd with the same joys and woes  Like notes accordant from th' harmonious lyre  Barometers alike thus rise and fall  Elate with sunshine or by clouds deprest  The same sublime affection moves on all  So friendship acts upon the social breast  But most like pasteboard figures seem t' agree  Which when the sky is neither foul nor fair  At neighbouring doors in kindly amity  Partake the common privilege of air  But if perchance the brightening sky should clear  And Phoebus spread his shining tresses wide  Or threatning cloud drop some foreboding tear  Far as they can the former friends divide  And some there are I ween who like the sun  Cheer the fair opening bud with friendly gleam  But when expanded wide its beauties shun  Or envious wither with oppressive beam  Others like wanton dames exhaust their charms  On all alike nor heed th' intrinsic worth  And lose within a thousand different arms  What one alone had foster'd into birth  Some like the tuneful tenants of the shade  A fond and close but short alliance make  The purpose serv'd which first their union made  A long farewel the future strangers take  Others whom fortune blast with smoothtongued guile  The unsuspecting social heart betray  Like treacherous Syrens murdering with a smile  Like comets blazing with malignant ray  Amid this threatning deluge far outspread  Where shall the faithful dove of friendship rest  Return sweet bird to thy domestic shed  The poets age and miracles are ceas'd  Ah yet return not spread thy pinions wide  No labour spare encompass land and sea  Let naught th' inestimable jewel hide  Find me a friend if any friend there be  Nay better thou should'st suffer fair deceit  Than solitary to my breast return  Who dreams of pleasure is not so complete  A wretch as he who only wakes to mourn  ELIZA'S WEDDINGDAY AN ECLOGUE  INTRODUCTION  O Could my Muse with gentle Gay  Upon the boxen hautboy play  Or with sweet pipe of shepherd's boy  Make Windsor's shades resound with joy  Maria's beauties still should live  And mournful Strephon cease to grieve  Eliza's love Eliza's truth  Unfading bloom in endless youth  And every bright delicious charm  The barbed hand of Time disarm  But ah poor Colin vain thy lay  Yet do thy best and pipe away  COLIN  While from on high the flaming sun displays  The scorching fury of his noontide rays  And at the foot of this oakshaded hill  Our browsing cattle seek the cooling rill  Let us beguile the time with pleasing song  And stretch our languid limbs at ease along  STREPHON  What boots it Colin that our limbs are laid  Compos'd beneath the oak's refreshing shade  Or that around us on the yellow plain  The fertile ground is stock'd with plenteous grain  What tho' the meadows smile with cheerful green  And waving copses ornament the scene  Can shades or plenty or delightful views  O'er wounded minds the smiles of joy diffuse  When fond Maria fled her shepherd's arms  Plains meads and copses lost their wonted charms  C  Tho' just the cause ah what avails your grief  Since the pale Tyrant is to pity deaf  S  Tho' from my bosom Death has rudely torn  The fragrant rose he left the pointed thorn  Well may you Colin blithesome strains compose  Happy in love and stranger to my woes  Those blessings which your life with transports crown  Four moons agone I boasted as my own  But now tho' vigour youth and love remain  The charming object I lament in vain  C  And who that knew the lovely nymph forbears  The willing tribute of condoling tears  Bright was her form with graces richly deck'd  Commanding love attemper'd with respect  Sweet Modesty with social Freedom join'd  Her manners form'd and wit adorn'd her mind  How kind how courteous she to every swain  My wounded memory recollects with pain  But be all sorrows laid aside this day  To Colin's joys let Strephon's griefs give way  S  As soon the hare shall quit the sheltering brake  And linnets grey the yellow furze forsake  As soon shall British nymphs lose power to charm  And Afric' maids the shepherds bosoms warm  As I from this afflicted breast remove  The sad remembrance of Maria's love  Weep skies sigh gales droop all ye fading woods  Die every flower and murmuring mourn ye floods  Ye gayplum'd warblers cease your tuneful strains  Bats ravens screechowls scream along the plains  In pity to my woes ye swains around  Strip off the honours from the loaded ground  And let the fields deserted and forlorn  Three dismal months my lost Maria mourn  Then shall returning Spring their bosoms cheer  But ah in mine 'tis Winter all the year  C  My dear Eliza lov'd Maria more  Than bees the fragrance of the gaudy flower  Then while her praise I sing your woe suspend  And lose the lover in the generous friend  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Twice three revolving happy years and one  Since sacred wedlock join'd our hands are flown  Seven times the shifting seasons went and came  The seasons change our hearts remain the same  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Of every hue of every blossom dyed  The gay carnation is the garden's pride  So every beauty bright Eliza wears  Blest Colin's pride and softner of his cares  The fragrant clove in sweetness most excels  The lilly's fairest of the flowery belles  More sweet than cloves than spotless lillies fair  In Colin's eyes Eliza's beauties are  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Tell every nymph that mourns her swain's deceit  The lov'd Eliza is as good as sweet  When they like her each social virtue prove  Their swains like Colin shall return their love  Guiltless of anger harmless lambkins rove  The loving turtles coo within the grove  My constant Tray ne'er quits his master's side  The prudent ants unthinking swains deride  And bees beneficent with pleasing pains  Collect sweet honey to enrich the swains  Lambs turtles Tray and ants and bees may find  Their virtues blended in Eliza's mind  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Ye witless clowns who marriage joys deride  Nor know the comforts of a faithful bride  Attentive listen to my tender tale  Nor to your loss let prejudice prevail  By Winter's false inclement skies betray'd  A burning fever on my vitals prey'd  My fleecy charge Eliza's care supplied  Respondent to each groan Eliza sigh'd  Twelve sleepless nights sharp anguish rack'd my breast  Twelve sleepless nights Eliza banish'd rest  With care unwearied watch'd aside my bed  And with fond arm sustain'd my restless head  Each cooling herb applied to sooth my pain  Nor were her tender labours wrought in vain  Kind symptoms of returning health appear'd  And Love's rich cordial my weak spirits cheer'd  My strength renew'd joy sparkled in her eye  And fill'd my soul with grateful extasy  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Ye mantling vines that form the conscious bower  Where oft we pass the soft endearing hour  Whilst you to imitate our joys divine  In wanton folds your amorous branches twine  A thousand kisses whisper from your leaves  But barren of those sweets Eliza gives  For not the mingling arms or frequent kiss  But souls united cause the heartfelt bliss  Ye hills ye dales ye streams and shady groves  To distant plains resound our mutual loves  Eliza's presence with supreme delights  Shortens the summer's days and winter's nights  No irksome toil shall Colin e'er regard  Her happiness and love the rich reward  Blest be the day at each return thrice blest  That gave Eliza to my raptur'd breast  This day may no misfortune vex the swains  No ripen'd corn be laid by furious rains  No luckless reaper meet with painful wound  Or tread the stinging adder on the ground  No nipping blasts the hopeful grapes assail  Or make the downy peaches withering fail  But may propitious Love excite to mirth  And Ceres' honours grace the teeming earth  With golden fruit the loaded trees be crown'd  And purple clusters on the vines abound  Now cease ye hills ye dales ye streams and groves  To tell the distant plains our mutual loves  S  Well hast thou Colin tun'd the oaten reed  Thy songs the songs of nightingales exceed  Unable to withstand thy powerful lay  The melancholy fiend is hied away  To fate resign'd I feel returning rest  Sweet friendship now has all my soul possest  And Colin young with his Eliza fair  Shall equal portions of my bosom share  Long may succeeding years their love renew  A pattern for each nymph and shepherd true  And may Eliza fair and Colin young  To distant times by happy pairs be sung  This and as far as page inclusive by the same gentleman  PROLOGUE  BY ER  LAdies the ends for which we meet tonight  Are social good and innocent

COLLINS  The scene of the following stanzas is supposed to lie on the Thames near Richmond This ode and the subsequent account of the author were by an unlucky accident omitted in our last number    IN yonder grove a Druid lies  Where slowly winds the stealing wave  The Year's best sweets shall duteous rise  To deck its Poet's sylvan grave  In yon deep bed of whispering reeds  His airy harp  The harp of Aeolus of which see a description in the Castle of Indolence  shall now be laid  That he whose heart in sorrow bleeds  May love thro' life the soothing shade  Then maids and youths shall linger here  And while its sounds at distance swell  Shall sadly seem in Pity's ear  To hear the Woodland Pilgrim's knell  Remembrance oft shall haunt the shore  When Thames in summerwreaths is drest  And oft suspend the dashing oar  To bid his gentle spirit rest  And oft as Ease and Health retire  To breezy lawn or forest deep  The friend shall view yon whitening  Richmond church  spire  And 'mid the varied landscape weep  But thou who own'st that earthy bed  Ah what will every dirge avail  Or tears which Love and Pity shed  That mourn beneath the gliding sail  Yet lives there one whose heedless eye  Shall scorn thy pale shrine glimmering near  With him sweet Bard may Fancy die  And Joy desert the blooming year  But thou lorn Stream whose sullen tide  No sedgecrown'd Sisters now attend  Now waft me from the green hill's side  Whose cold turf hides the buried Friend  And see the fairy valleys fade  Dun Night has veil'd the solemn view  Yet once again dear parted Shade  Meek Nature's Child again adieu  The genial meads assign'd to bless  Thy life shall mourn thy early doom  Their hinds and shepherdgirls shall dress  With simple hands thy rural tomb  Long long thy stone and pointed clay  Shall melt the musing Briton's eyes  O vales and wild woods shall he say  In yonder grave your Druid lies  The following character of Mr Thomson in his poem called the Castle of Indolence is said to be written by Lord L  A Bard there dwelt more fat than Bard beseems  Who void of envy guile and lust of gain  On Virtue still and Nature's pleasing themes  Pour'd forth his unpremeditated strain  The world forsaking with a calm disdain  Here laugh'd he careless in his easy seat  Here quaff'd encircled with the joyous train  Oftmoralizing Sage his ditty sweet  He loathed much to write ne cared to repeat  SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MR WILLIAM COLLINS  MR William Collins was born at Chichester in Sussex in the year in which city his father was a reputable tradesman He was admitted a scholar of Winchester college Feb where he spent seven years under the care of the learned Dr Burton In the year in consideration of his merit he was placed first in the list of those scholars who are elected from Winchester college to New college in Oxford but no vacancy happening at the latter he was entered the same year a commoner of Queen's college Ox and July was elected a demy or scholar of Magdalen college in the same university At school he began to study poetry and criticism particularly the latter The following epigram made by him while at Winchesterschool discovers a genius and turn of expression very rarely to be met with in juvenile compositions  TO MISS AURELIA CR ON HER WEEPING AT HER SISTER'S WEDDING  CEase fair Aurelia cease to mourn  Lament not Hannah's happy state  You may be happy in your turn  And seize the treasure you regret  With Love united Hymen stands  And softly whispers to your charms  " Meet but your lover in my bands  " You'll find your sister in his arms"  His Latin exercises were never so much admired as his EnglishAt Oxford he wrote the epistle to Sir Thomas Hanmer and Oriental eclogues which were first published in under the title of Persian eclogues About the year he left Oxford having taken the degree of bachelor of arts weary of the confinement and uniformity of an academical life fondly imagining that a man of parts was sure of making his fortune in London and struck with the name of author and poet without consulting his friends he immediately removed to town and rashly resolved to  live by his pen without undertaking the drudgery of any profession Here he soon dissipated his small fortune to compensate for which he projected the history of the revival of learning in Italy under the pontificates of Julius II and Leo X His subscription for this work not answering his expectations he engaged with a bookseller to translate Aristotle's Poetics and to illustrate it with a large and regular comment This scheme also being laid aside he turn'd his thoughts to dramatic poetry and being intimately acquainted with the manager resolved to write a tragedy which however he never executed In the year he published his odes and shortly after went abroad to our army in Flanders to attend his uncle colonel Martin who dying soon after his arrival left him a considerable fortune which however he did not live long to enjoy for he fell into a nervous disorder which continued with but short intervals till his death which happened in and with which disorder his head and intellects were at times affected  For a man of such an elevated genius Mr Collins has wrote but little his time was chiefly taken up in laying extensive projects and vast designs which he never even begun to put in execution  We have been favoured with the following account of Mr Collins by a gentleman deservedly eminent in the republic of letters who knew him intimately well  Mr Collins was a man of extensive literature and of vigorous faculties He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues but with the Italian French and Spanish languages He had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction and subjects of fancy and by indulging some peculiar habits of thought was eminently delighted with those flights of imagination which pass the bounds of nature and to which the mind is reconciled only by a passive acquiescence in popular traditions He loved fairies genii giants and monsters he delighted to rove through the meanders of inchantment to gaze on the magnificence of golden palaces to repose by the waterfals of Elysian gardens This was however the character rather of his inclination than his genius the grandeur of wildness and the novelty of extravagance were always desired by him but were not always attained But diligence is never wholly lost if his efforts sometimes caused harshness and obscurity they likewise produced in happier moments sublimity and splendour This idea which he had formed of excellence led him to oriental fictions and allegorical imagery and perhaps  while he was intent upon description he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life but somewhat obstructed in its progress by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties  His morals were pure and his opinions pious In a long continuance of poverty and long habits of dissipation it cannot be expected that any character should be exactly uniform There is a degree of want by which the freedom of agency is almost destroyed and long association with fortuitous companions will at last relax the strictness of truth and abate the fervour of sincerity That this man wise and virtuous as he was passed always unentangled through the snares of life it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm But it may be said that at least he preserved the source of action unpolluted that his principles were never shaken that his distinctions of right and wrong were never confounded and that his faults had nothing of malignity or design but proceeded from some unexpected pressure or casual temptation  The latter part of his life cannot be remembred but with pity and sadness He languished some years under that depression of mind which enchains the faculties without destroying them  and leaves reason the knowledge of right without the power of pursuing it These clouds which he found gathering on his intellects he endeavoured to disperse by travel and passed into France but found himself constrained to yield to his malady and returned he was for some time confined in a house of lunatics and afterwards retired to the care of his sister in Colchester where death at last came to his relief  After his return from France the writer of this character paid him a visit at Islington where he was waiting for his sister whom he had directed to meet him there was then nothing of disorder discernable in his mind by any but himself but he had then withdrawn from study and travelled with no other book than an English testament such as children carry to the school when his friend took it into his hand out of curiosity to see what companion a man of letters had chosen  "I have but one book" says Collins "but that is the best"  GENERAL INDEX  {inverted ⁂}The numerals refer to
