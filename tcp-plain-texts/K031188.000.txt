 THE AUCTION A POEM A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND With the head of HARPOCRATES the God of Silence amongst the Egyptians in a Ring  LONDON Printed for GEORGE KEARSLY at No Ludgatestreet MDCCLXX  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Poem consisted originally of no more than about a hundred and fifty lines and was sent by the Author with the head of HARPOCRATES the God of Silence in a ring to a particular friend who suggested to him that if it were properly enlarged it might not be unworthy the perusal of the Public in consequence of which he has accordingly enlarged it and submits it to their Candour and Indulgence  If the Critic should accuse him of absurdity for giving language to the god of Silence he answers there may be times when the actions of men are so palpably absurd and so totally  subversive of Liberty that even the tongue of Silence may become eloquent in its cause  If this subterfuge is too flimsey to pass he flies to the  poetica licentia  that extensive field of fiction where the Poet is allowed to dispose of animation personification or elocution in any manner his fancy directs uncontrouled by the shackles of common sense  That part of the Poem where Mr HOLLAND is mentioned was printed off before his death otherwise the Author would in a different manner have given his opinion of the goodness of that valuable Actor's heart  ERRATUM  In Page Line for "bleeding

home  There as the Nile o'erspread the earth  And gave to vegetation birth  She fraught with sentiment refin'd  Diffus'd her influence o'er the mind  'Twas then convinc'd when folly hung  Impatient on the babler's tongue  How much repose to all 'twould yield  If by my pow'r his lips were seal'd  Her sapient sons my image rear'd  And I became a God rever'd  There many an age preserv'd my reign  A foe to folly and her train  At length a mummyhunting lord  Whose head Virtù and dullness stor'd  Who left his country to explore  The trifles of each foreign shore  Brought me with other wrecks of time  To this all variable clime  Long in his cabinet I lay  Secluded from the face of day  For tho' he travell'd far and wide  To gratify his curious pride  Had travers'd Egypt Greece and Rome  And brought a heap of trump'ry home  It surely must provoke your laughter  He scarcely ever saw them after  At length one night replete with evil  The dice together with the devil  Join'd issue with the sons of fraud  And I appear'd again abroad  The large estate a father's care  Bequeath'd a most ungracious heir  The hand of usury had seiz'd  And most unmercifully squeez'd  From thence no succours could arise  No pleasing hope of new supplies  Yet debts of honor all must pay  Or they again can never play  Many and artful were the ways  His lordship try'd a sum to raise  At first he claim'd the promis'd place  He earn'd by pimping for his grace  But who misfortunes can resist  He and his party were dismiss'd  Then to the next in pow'r apply'd  So mean his soul so fall'n his pride  But as they did not want his aid  In vain was each concession made  When finding all expedients fail  At last he fix'd onwhat A sale  To Langford straight a message sent  Expressive of his full intent  Who came his orders to obey  Bowing and smirking all the way  A catalogue was quickly made  Prefac'd with pomp and much parade  Of urns from Herculaneum brought  In fact not worth a single groat  Of headless trunk and noseless bust  Tarnish'd by artificial rust  Of medals brought from Rome and Greece  Who know to pluck your English geese  Fragments of pyramids from Egypt  Fossils and shells long time in sea dipt  With each exotic by the score  Which would a volume fill and more  Some natives too by Langford's art  Made of the catalogue a part  The public prints announc'd the day  When hundreds came who could not pay  And yet they needs must come to shew  Their veneration for Virtù  The Seasons by Leticia Brndn  Were bought her cabinet to stand on  When he who languish'd to be blest  Thus artfully the fair address'd  " The Spring when all its beauties rise  I see depicted in your eyes  See Summer in its gayest pride  Attendant ever on your side  Rich Autumn in your bosom see  And Winter in your chastity  Tell me Leticia then the reasons  You thus are anxious for the seasons  She felt the fascinating art  And freely yielded up her heart  The modern bards as yet whose rhyme  Is not with value stamp'd by time  Were indiscriminately sold  For nothing as they were not old  For Clio the historic muse  Two authors bid with equal views  The one in female vestments clad  The other wrap'd around with plad  Long they contended for the field  Too headstrong both and proud to yield  At length exclaim'd the bonny Scot  Suppose fair lass we share the lot  When lo a hollow sound was heard  And bursting from the floor appear'd  A rev'rend form with aspect bland  Fair Truth and Candor in his hand  Around his honour'd brow was seen  The laurel ever fresh and green  " How long began the rev'rend Sage  O Smllt shall thy partial page  Presumptuously my peace invade  And draw me from Elysium's shade  How long shall Clio honour'd name  By whom I reach'd immortal fame  To prejudice and passion bend  To serve a hotbrain'd woman's end"  The animated muse return'd  " Long have I with resentment burn'd  Still hoping some propitious hour  Would free me from tyrannic pow'r  'Tis come my soul with rapture warms  Rapin O take me to thy arms  The floor receiv'd them unadmonish'd  And left the bidders all astonish'd  When Phaeton whose thirst of fame  Had nearly set the world on flame  Was by an able statesman bought  Whose soul with rectitude was fraught  'Twas wonder'd he so fond of truth  Should buy a headstrong brainless youth  Said he I buy him to rebuke  The conduct of a certain duke  And 'midst the universal stare  Sent him post haste to Grosvener Square  A Diomede who slily bore  From Troy's illfated walls of yore  The sacred pledge of freedom giv'n  To her by all indulgent heav'n  Was by an earl of Northern race  Purchas'd his cabinet to grace  At which a patriot high inflam'd  Indignantly and loud exclaim'd  " No wonder he who basely plan'd  The fall of freedom in this land  Should with exhilerated soul  Buy him who Troy's palladium stole"  ALCIDES' club whose pond'rous weight  Seem'd falling on the Hydra's pate  Was by an enterprizing knight  Beheld with wonder and delight  " That club said he with good direction  " Would make fine work at an election  " I'll have it spite of all expence  " Tho' murder prove the consequence"  He bought and gave it to MAC'QUIRK  Who made at Brentford glorious work  Beat out poor CLARK'S illfated brains  And gain'd a pension for his pains  In bronze the bust of CROMWELL stood  Anxious alone for England's good  A noble Lord of Stewart's race  Turn'd pale and trembling left the place  And while precipitate he fled  Look'd round in terror for his head  " So long as shall exist this land  " May CROMWELL fraught with terror stand  " To him who Britain's law defies"  A Middlesex elector cries  When antiques made by modern hands  Were bought by antiquarian SDS  When he affected to define  This Grecian and that Florentine  O how it tickled up the fancy  Of nicelyjudging Doctor CHNCY  For NEWTON'S head whose piercing eyes  Explor'd the wonders of the skies  Who could with certitude declare  The size and distance of each star  MARTIN and FERGUSON contended  And how the contest would have ended  I know not had not evening come  And call'd them both to lecture home  They gone no bidders could I see  So light was held philosophy  Close in a corner SHAKESPEAR'S bust  Neglected stood defil'd with dust  When GARRICK saw it with respect  He bow'd and spake to this effect  " O thou who could'st with ease impart  " The passions of the human heart  " Who studiously look'd nature through  " And shew'd her in each point of view  " Shall it be told in future I  " When thou wert sold stood tamely by  " Forbid it all the pow'rs above  " Duty forbid forbid it love"  And thence to shew his high regard  He to his bosom hug'd the bard  The ancient poets heads were bought  By men who would be poets thought  First FAWKS and COLEMAN made a fuss  Bought TERENCE and THEOCRITUS  Next FRANKLIN falling on his knees  Worshipp'd and bought old SOPHOCLES  But through so many ages soil'd  In cleaning they the features spoil'd  ANTINOUS blooming as the dawn  In Titians glowing colours drawn  By CHRLT HY'S was bought with joy  Who much admir'd the handsome boy  Her keeper smiling at the bull  Told her his character in full  She trembled at the horrid tale  Turn'd pale and red and red and pale  Grew quite enrag'd with grief and pain  Then threw it from her with disdain  A noble lord with pitying eye  Beheld his fav'rite prostrate lie  And thus his sentiments exprest  " Come injur'd beauty to my breast  " To Italy whose kindly arms  " Shall shield thee from these rude alarms  " Together safely we'll retreat  " Nor breath a sigh for TLNS seat"  And now a gay resplendent star  Became the object of their care  But where shall I description find  To paint each agitated mind  Charm'd with the lustre of its ray  All madly bid and bid away  At length a patriot whose fame  Was rais'd by popular acclaim  Who on the shoulders of the croud  Had bawl'd for liberty aloud  For the bright gem his freedom gave  And down he sunk a titled slave  By BARRAT next a noble view  Was nobly purchas'd by BUCCLEUGH  Happy the painter who can find  A patron of exalted mind  This to his tints fresh vigour gives  By this the lifeless canvas lives  And hence when BARRAT meets our eyes  We see another BERGHAM rise  A much esteem'd Jardin d'amour  Bought by his lordship in his tour  For an original was sold  And fetch'd its weight in sterling gold  A Frenchman chuckled at the joke  And thus in broken accents spoke  " Mon Dieu mon Pere it make me laugh  " To see de connoisseur de calf  " Dat fine original from France  " Was copied dere by Englis DANCE"  To whom with joy a stander by  Quickly retorted this reply  " When ancient Rome in arms was found  " Superior to the nations round  " When science rear'd her latent head  " And all abroad her influence spread  " When arts beneath her fost'ring wing  " Luxuriously were seen to spring  " The great Augustus mildly reign'd  " His peoples father patron friend  " What wonder then if we behold  " One cause the same effect unfold  " Behold in Britain favour'd isle  " Excited by the royal smile  " Arts arms and science justly claim  " The wreath of universal fame"  FOOTE for the head of Momus try'd  And so did many a wag beside  But whether 'twas prophetic fear  Inspir'd the cautious auctioneer  Or whether he as oft the case is  Had bidders plac'd in diff'rent places  Because this lot was of the number  Left on his hands 'mongst former lumber  Impossible for me to fix  Who know so little of their tricks  Thus much is certain on his tongue  These words reiterated hung  " A going going speak in time  " The price is nothing 'tis a crime  " A crime of most enormous hue  " To trifle thus with dear Virtù  " And Sir believe me till this hour  " The ling'ring hammer void of pow'r  " Had hung but that the gen'ral frown  " Brought it precipitately down"  FOOTE gain'd the head his foes defeated  Quick to the theatre retreated  And close in league with Momun join'd  At LANGFORD laugh'd and all mankind  Poor POWELL's patent next appears  To pay off all his old arrears  When DAGGER MARR and TOMMY CLOUGH  Blasted and swore and said as how  'Twas the advice of all their friends  That they should join their odds and ends  That injur'd merit long kept down  Might rise to entertain the town  DAGGER says TOM how stands your purse  Ah me says DAGGER there's the curse  Which to our rising fame I fear  Will prove a permanent barrier  He drew it forth and wrap'd around  In dirty rag a shilling found  This might have done in FLEETWOOD's days  Said TOM when puppet shews and plays  An equal share of fame possest  The puppet shew in gen'ral best  But now by gwere I to join  My hoarded  grunter  's  gig  A cant term for a shilling  to thine  The patent's such a blasted price  We should not get a single slice  TOM loung'd and MARR with tragic port  Stalk'd swearing onward to Duke's Court  Where drench'd in beer 'till morning dawn  Their future hopes their money gone  And quite with want of oaths opprest  They sunk insensibly to rest  Now KING or HOLLAND 'twas agreed  Were fittest POWELL to succeed  But HOLLAND when his friend was nam'd  Supprest the tear and thus declaim'd  " Say can I think e're well the tomb  " Is clos'd upon his manly bloom  " While grief yet triumphs on the face  " Of all his little orphan race  " Say can I think at their expence  " To raise myself to eminence  " No rather let one greatly try  " The patent for their use to buy"  KING who of generous mold is made  And feels for all who want his aid  Turns suddenly about and cries  Why "what the devil ails my eyes"  Others there were who eyed askance  The parchment with a longing glance  Whose hearts obdurate never felt  Whose eyes unpitying never melt  To human nature a disgrace  Who curst their stars and left the place  While things in this uncertain state  Hung wav'ring on the thread of fate  A messenger arriv'd express  And thus deliver'd his address  " The noble friend the gods be prais'd  " Who POWELL to the patent rais'd  " Hath seen the hapless widow's tear  " All copious streaming on his bier  " And touch'd with pity at the sight  " Transfers to her her husband's right"  A gen'ral plaudit shook the room  And joy dispel'd the recent gloom  A medal which no semblance bore  To those by artists made of yore  But smooth as one some years ago  Invented drawn and grav'd by YEO  And lately bought on Stratford's plain  Was for a dinner sold again  Pox of the jubilee said one  Another in sarcastick tone  Swore 'twas a farce a fair take in  The whole not worth a single pin  The ode no poetry could boast  The musick was in discord lost  The temple to the first of bards  Was like a tott'ring house of cards  Thus he affected to despise  What he had seen with envious eyes  And swelling heard with conscious pride  Loud peals of laughter on his side  When from among the croud a youth  Thus boldly spake impell'd by truth  " When culprit reason truant plays  " And wanders forth in fancy's maze  " Thy random shafts may please awhile  " And raise the unreflecting smile  " But soon as absent sense returns  " Our cheek with indignation burns  " We feel the folly and disgrace  " Of being cheated by grimace  " I too this institution saw  " Which struck each feeling breast with awe  " Saw all the human powers combin'd  " In GARRICK's animated mind  " Saw filial love his soul engage  " To the great father of the stage  " And felt what thou canst ne'er impart  " The bliss of reason round my heart"  At which Contempt in Laughter's place  Possession took of every face  So truth for ever with her frown  Shall bear the bauble folly down  A curious bust of Indian clay  Which bore the marks of regal sway  Brought in the Plassy from Bengal  Was sent to Merchant Taylor's hall  'T was by an Eastern artist wrought  Beyond the reach of common thought  A spring no mortal could suspect  If touch'd produc'd this strange effect  The head would shake the eyes would roll  And seeming life possest the whole  To know its history and fame  The universal wish became  When one in Eastern learning skill'd  The universal wish fulfill'd  " In ancient times when the rude north  " Pour'd her rapacious children forth  " When like a widely spreading flood  " They delug'd all the East with blood  " They seiz'd that hapless prince's throne  " And deem'd his revenues their own  " Some say it still recorded stands  " He fell untimely by their hands  " But in these days when justice reigns  " The horrid tale no credit gains"  While he proceeded to relate  This prince's and his country's fate  The messenger the busto bearing  Return'd and begg'd a patient hearing  " Soon as said he the spot I gain'd  " Where truth and elocution reign'd  " Fronting the chair I took my stand  " Applying to the spring my hand  " Shake not said one thy head at me  " Thou can'st not say I murder'd thee  " Let not thine eye indignant roll  " Another cry'd to fright my soul  " A Third exclaim'd ye shades of night  " 'Tis DWA hide me from his sight  " And now a gen'ral terror ran  " Through all and catch'd from man to man  " I seiz'd the moment of dismay  " And came with hasty steps away  " When from a prince to empire born  " The diadem is basely torn  " The wretch who gave the bleeding blow  " May well the action disavow  " May well should e'er his shade appear  " To petrifaction turn with fear  " But that the unpolluted heart  " Should thus eccentrically start  " That souls as virtue's bosom fair  " Should shake at trifles light as air  " Shake like the murderer and thief  " Amazes me beyond belief"  He ceas'd and with him all agreed  'Twas strange 'twas passing strange indeed  A group of heads but lately brought  From Herculaneum's dreadful vault  Gorg'd when th' Almighty hid his face  And nature trembled to her base  Came in rotation to be sold  And LANGFORD thus their hist'ry told  " These were the men when Rome arose  " Said he with vengeance on her foes  " When from the orient to the north  " Her eagles flew with terror forth  " When she to half the world gave law  " And kneeling kept the rest in awe  " These were the men who brought disgrace  " On her and all the Roman race  " Restor'd what long she sought to gain  " By millions spent and thousands slain  " And bid her conqu'ring legions cease  " Brib'd by the nations round to peace  " 'Twas then the high patrician pride  " Look'd with contempt on all beside  " 'Twas then the public treasure went  " To serve each infamous intent  " 'Twas then corrupt her senate grown  " Assum'd a pow'r before unknown  " And freedom by the swelling tear  " Confess'd her dissolution near  " 'Twas then her judges warp'd the laws  " To serve th' abandon'd villain's cause  " Then o'er a son whose guiltless blood  " Fast flow'd a weeping father stood  " The prop of his declining day  " Snatch'd by the murd'rer's arm away  " And saw the wretch by vile chicane  " Escape by whom his son was slain  " Then justice hid abash'd her head  " Misrule her baleful influence spread  " And stalking forth with giant stride  " Menac'd destruction far and wide  " At length enrag'd the people rose  " And rush'd impetuous on their foes  " To justice brought them for their crimes  " A mark to all succeeding times  " And lo beneath the sculptor's hand  " Consign'd to infamy they stand"  All look'd astonish'd at the tale  Some blush'd and some turn'd sickly pale  When one intelligent of soul  Thus feelingly address'd the whole  " Would you my countrymen but cast  " A retrospect on cent'rys past  " Would you explore th' historic page  " Transmitted down from age to age  " Then would you feel without alloy  " The many blessings you enjoy  " Thrice happy England happy plains  " Where justice dwells and freedom reigns  " Where round a virtuous monarch stand  " A glorious patriotic band  " Watchful and firm with ARGUS' eyes  " To guard her laws against surprize  " Where GRAFTON  ever honour'd  name  " Immortal on the roll of fame  " Who like an ATLAS bears the weight  " Attendant on a mighty state  "  Ne'er  leaves the council  ne'er  attends  " Newmarket and his jockeyfriends  " Who when the fascinating die  " Bids ample patrimonies fly  "  Ne'er  mingles in the guilty train  " Damn'd to variety of pain  " Where GRAFTON stands  unaw'd  by fear  " Tho' faction thunder in his ear  " Let fear the guilty mind deform  " The  virtuous  man defies the storm  " Where BEDFORD whose exalted breast  " Is by fair freedom's love imprest  " To whom  Hibernia's  sons shall raise  " The voice of  unabating  praise  " Who when the laurel once the boast  " Of Britain's nervous sons was lost  " Bid war with all his horrors cease  " And gave his vanquish'd country peace  " Refus'd  all  profit for himself  " Superior to the love of pelf  "  All  save a snuffbox trifling thing  " Presented by the Gallic king  " Where BEDFORD stands beyond the reach  " Of those who dare his fame impeach  " Contemns the shafts around him hurl'd  " And scorns the malice of the world  " Where  virtuous  MANSFIELD first and best  " Of orators by all confess'd  " Whose  firm undeviating  heart  " From rectitude shall  ne'er  depart  " But who an angel might believe  " If he attempted to deceive  " Who in the gay convivial hour  " When wine prevails o'er reason's pow'r  " Hath seen his friends drink copious streams  " In healths to CHARLEY and to JAMES  " Hath seen them on their knees implore  " High heav'n their Sn to restore  " Yet hath  refus'd  the knee to bend  " Solicited by ev'ry friend  " And nobly  scorn'd  the guilty wine  "  True  to the Hanoverian line  " Where MANSFIELD stands O glorious cause  " To  guard  and to  explain  her laws  " Laws which our ancestors obtain'd  " When JOHN and either HENRY reign'd  " When they the tyrant's arm withstood  " And purchas'd freedom with their blood  " Laws which at ev'ry father's hand  " The son with justice may demand  " Still unsubverted and intire  " As he receiv'd them from his Sire  " O 'tis a theme on which to dwell  " With pleasure makes each art'ry swell  " Extatick to the last degree  " Britannia's highborn sons to see  " With fond parental care secure  " Her laws inviolably pure  " But for those grinning traytors there  " Condemn'd their country's hate to bear  " Take them my friend O take them hence  " And with another lot commence"  Next came an old historic piece  Which rival'd all the works of Greece  The story was so well portray'd  Assisted so by light and shade  That e'en the most consummate dunce  Might know the history at once  The hero of the canvas stood  In many a diff'rent attitude  First in the senate he appear'd  And seem'd with much attention heard  Then as a minister of state  He scowl'd around with pride elate  Next stood an army in array  Which he appear'd employ'd to pay  One hand in bus'ness nicely skill'd  Perform'd that office 'tother fill'd  A coffer of enormous size  On which he look'd with jealous eyes  Near this again he stood confest  A tempting coronet his crest  The sure the neverfailing boast  Of those who serve their country most  But last disgraceful situation  Accus'd by all of peculation  Abandon'd and detested grown  He safety sought behind a throne  Whether the people dragg'd him thence  To pay for his suppos'd offence  Or suffer'd him secure to stay  The painter's art forbore to say  Forbore on purpose I presume  To give imagination room  Still were the tints so fresh and fair  Tho' painted many a hundred year  The preservation still so nice  'Twas sold at an enormous price  Its fate extreamly odd appear'd  When from the buyer's lips we heard  " 'Twas bought alone to decorate  " The room where traytors to the state  " For manifold offences lie  " Before they on the scaffold die"  Last came an urn which LGFD feign'd  Was carv'd when good AURELIUS reign'd  But which to me and all appear'd  The work of days far less rever'd  Full in the front in bassrelief  Rome's colonies o'erwhelm'd with grief  Were seen whilst commerce trembling stood  And fear'd again to tempt the flood  In alto on the other side  Enthron'd oppression sat and pride  Corruption near them held her seat  And freedom crouch'd beneath their feet  Whilst faction bursting from her cell  Encourag'd millions to rebel  Around this motto struck the eye  The sad remains of liberty  Who for so many ages spurn'd  Tyrannic rage behold inurn'd  Cut off O most unhallow'd deed  When least of all she fear'd to bleed  Much said the auctioneer to raise  The price and credit of the vase  'Twas he declar'd no modern bauble  But an Etruscan  veritable  And fit so capital a thing  Fit for the palace of a king  When one distinguish'd from the croud  Whose genius was by all allow'd  Superior to the common herd  On his own knowledge thus declar'd  " This curious vase exceeding like  " In all respects the true antique  " Is made my friends of modern clay  " By artists of the present day  " I know them perfectly could teach  " The name and character of each  " Could tell how all their lives were spent  " To bring about this blest event  " Who mix'd the clay who form'd the urn  " Who bid the flame so fiercely burn  " With life whose hand each figure crown'd  " And who inscrib'd the motto round  " But 'tis enough for me to prove  " Excited by my country's love  " To prove of equal rank in fame  " The ancient and the modern name  " He sent it to Saint STEPHEN's fane  " Where liberty was wont to reign  " And said tho' she be banish'd thence  " Her ashes cannot give offence  " When all the catalogue was sold  " Bust Urn and Picture turn'd to gold  " By LD's art who said his say  " In his obliging smiling way  " I hapless I who tell the tale  " Was offer'd up to public sale  " Silence a lady cry'd for shame  " Silence indeed I hate the name"  An empty prating fool reply'd  " Madam with you I coincide"  " And so do I reply'd a brother"  Another still and still another  Reply'd the same and all the cry  Was who the duce would Silence buy  " No bidders LD knock'd me down  " To a Jewbroker for a crown  " Who with small interest content  " Sold me for ten times ten per cent  " From him 'twas my mishap to pass  " Into a Virtuoso's glass  " Near whose abode a structure stands  " Where men from the remotest lands  " Of indiscriminate degrees  " All buz and gather round like bees  " Where Christians Jews and Turks confound  " Language in undistinguish'd sound  " Behind it stands that famous place  " Where modesty ne'er shews her face  " Where ign'rance if she chance to come  " Is certainly sent wadling home  " Whose lawless sons avow this creed  " By lies and fraud we best succeed  " And meet tumultuous ev'ry day  " On each unwary fool to prey  " Offended thus my eyes and ears  " Out burst involuntary tears  " My long invelop'd tongue I try'd  " Nor found the use of speech deny'd  Said I "Oif thy breast  " Compassion feels for the distrest  " If when the heartdepressing sigh  " Hath burst the sluices of the eye  " Thy soul susceptible hath known  " Concern for sorrows not thy own  " Surely thou wilt with pity hear  " Nor treat contemptuously my pray'r  " Deliver me for thou art able  " From this detested modern Babel"  He listen'd with astonish'd ear  The tongue of Silence thus to hear  And while his breast with anger burn'd  Thus with severity return'd  " Dar'st thou presumptuously defame  " This spot by that opprobrious name  " Where matchless beauty ev'ry day  " Shines forth with undiminish'd ray  " Where merchants meet of genuine worth  " From the four quarters of the earth  " Men who expand the golden sail  " Of commerce to the rising gale  " Bring tides of wealth in copious streams  " Along the bosom of the Thames  " And bid AUGUSTA in the eyes  " Of all the grand emporium rise  " Dar'st thou presumptuously reflect  " On such a place with disrespect"  Said I "Ah little did I dread  " To draw thy vengeance on my head  " Else had consummate Silence hung  " For ever on my hapless tongue  " But how shall mis'ry find relief  " If she neglect to tell her grief  " How shall the wretch opprest with woe  " Emerge if none his sorrows know  " I hop'd in some sequester'd cot  " Such as thou oft hast wish'd thy lot  " Beside a stream and sylvan shade  " Thou kindly wouldst have seen me laid  " Or to some friend to sense and thee  " Who when from folly's children free  " Glad from the bustling world retreats  " And science in his study meets  " Thou wouldst my person have consign'd  " In mercy to my tortur'd mind  " Let then compassion in thine eye  " Assure me thou wilt yet comply  " Let anger in thy bosom cease  " And give me once again to peace  " And now his stubborn soul subdu'd  " No longer was my pray'r withstood  When kindly he "O cease to grieve  " I pity thee and will relieve  " I have HARPOCRATES a friend  " Who never will thy ear offend"  " Dumb I presume" "Not he indeed  " He talks as fast as I can read  " But then his tongue flows smoothly on  " With sense in perfect unison"  " Go to him give my compliments  " Assure him why thou com'st and whence  " Tell all thy tale nay do not linger  " And beg he'll wear thee on his finger"  FINIS
