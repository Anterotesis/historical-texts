 MATILDA A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By the AUTHOR of the EARL of WARWICK  LONDON  Printed for T CADELL opposite CatherineStreet in the Strand PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  DEDICATION  TO THE PUBLIC  SIR  PERMIT me to return you my unfeigned thanks for your kind reception of this  Tragedy  on the stage and to request the continuance of your favour to it in the closet It would be the highest ingratitude in me to forget the only patron I ever had the good fortune to meet with by whose powerful assistance I have been enabled to defeat the combined forces of envy malice and detraction I must at the same time fairly confess my victory over the enemy was owing I believe as many other victories have been more to the art and prowess of my  Officers  than to any extraordinary merit of my own To the first in command Miss YOUNGE I have infinite obligations which I shall always gratefully acknowledge tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them nor can the skill and conduct of my generals REDDISH SMITH and PALMER be sufficiently admired To your patronage and protection I most heartily and sincerely recommend them If I have been the happy instrument of giving them a favourable opportunity of rising in  your  esteem it will give me the greatest satisfaction  You  can best distinguish their merit and  you  alone are able to reward it  I am Sir your much obliged And devoted humble Servant The Author  Dramatis Personae  MEN  MORCAR  Earl of Mercia  Mr REDDISH  EDWIN  Earl of Northumberland  Mr SMITH  SIWARD  Morcar's friend  Mr PALMER  OFFICERS  c  Â   WOMEN  MATILDA  A prisoner in the camp of Morcar  Miss YOUNGE  BERTHA  Her friend  Miss PLATT  SCENE MORCAR's Camp and the Environs near NOTTINGHAM  PROLOGUE  Written by a FRIEND  Spoken by Mr SMITH  A Tragic Tale from Norman William's Age  Simple and unadorn'd attempts the Stage  Our silly Bard more simple than his Tale  Thinks on your polish'd Manners to prevail  What in those barb'rous Days were counted Crimes  Are Slips of course in these enlighten'd Times  Let not your Ancestors too rude appear  Though firm in Friendship and in Love sincere  Love then like Glory did each Heart inflame  Beauty  was  Virtue  and to win it  Fame  Now Lovers lose their Mistresses with Grace  As at NewMarket they would lose a Race  Where if in Hopes they seem a little cross'd  'Tis for the Money of the Match that's lost  When Tilts and Tournaments call'd forth the Brave  The Fame of spotless Innocence to save  Each gallant Knight preferr'd his Love to Life  For  then  the greatest Blessing was a Wife  To prove their Chastity the dauntless Fair  Would walk through Flames nor singe a single Hair  Nay some so chaste so cold to all Desire  Not only scap'd it they put out the Fire  But now no Heroes die for Love's sweet Passion  And  fiery Trials  are quite out of Fashion  Ye Sons of Frailtyyou whom Rage devours  For yo  this Night the Muse exerts her Pow'rs  With crimson Hands pale Cheeks and bloodshot Eyes  She bids the Furies in their Terrors rise  In Valour's Breast their Scorpion Stings they dart  First fire the Brain and then corrupt the Heart  But what avails all Virtue Passion's gust  Like Whirlwinds drive it from the Heart like Dust  When Reason dawns well may Repentance mourn  Love Friendship Duty by the Roots uptorn  To sooth this fatal Vice the Flatterer tells  In stormy Minds how warmest Friendship dwells  The Tree whose sheltering Arms spread kindly round  If Light'ningstruck lies blasted on the Ground  In vain will Merits past Indulgence claim  One Moment's Rashness blasts whole Years of Fame  EPILOGUE  By the AUTHOR of the TRAGEDY  Spoken by Miss YOUNGE  HA ha poor Creature how you trembling stand  Come to the Bar Sir and hold up your Hand  You

MATILDA'S Tent with a view of the distant country  MATILDA BERTHA  MATILDA  I Thank thee gentle Bertha for thy goodness  If aught cou'd sooth the anguish of my soul  Or raise it from the horrors of despair  To hope and joy 'twou'd be thy gen'rous friendship  But I am sunk so deep in misery  That comfort cannot reach me  BERTHA  Talk not thus  My sweet Matilda innocence like thine  Must be the care of alldirecting heav'n  Already hath the interposing hand  Of providence redeem'd thee from the rage  Of savage war and shelter'd thee within  This calm asylum Mercia's potent Earl  The noble Morcar will protect thy virtues  And if I err not wishes but to share  His conquests with thee  MATILDA  O my friend oft times  The flow'ry path that tempts our wand'ring steps  But leads to mis'ry what thou fondly deem'st  My soul's best comfort is its bitt'rest woe  Earl Morcar loves me To the gen'rous mind  The heaviest debt is that of gratitude  When 'tis not in our power to repay it  BERTHA  Oft' have I heard thee say to him thou ow'st  Thy honour and thy life  MATILDA  I told thee truth  Beneath my father's hospitable roof  I spent my earlier happier days in peace  And safety When the Norman conqu'ror came  Discord thou know'st soon lit her fatal torch  And spread destruction o'er this wretched land  The loyal Ranulph flew to William's aid  And left me to a faithful peasant's care  Who liv'd sequester'd in the fertile plains  Of rich Northumbria There awhile I dwelt  In sweet retirement when the savage Malcolm  Rush'd on our borders  BERTHA  I remember well  The melancholy hour Confusion rag'd  On ev'ry side and desolation spread  Its terrors round us How did'st thou escape  MATILDA  A crew of desp'rate ruffians seiz'd upon me  A helpless prey For O he was not there  Who best cou'd have defended his Matilda  Then had I fall'n a wretched sacrifice  To rbutal rage and lawless violence  Had not the gen'rous Morcar interpos'd  To save me Tho' he join'd the guilty cause  Of foul rebellion yet his soul abhor'd  Such violation At his awful voice  The surly ruffians left me and retir'd  He bore me half expiring in his arms  Back to his tent with ev'ry kind attention  There strove to sooth my griefs and promis'd soon  As fit occasion offer'd to restore me  To my afflicted father  BERTHA  Something sure  Was due to gen'rous Morcar for his aid  So timely given  MATILDA  No doubt But mark what follow'd  In my deliverer too soon I found  An ardent lover sighing at my feet  BERTHA  And what is there the proudest of our sex  Cou'd wish for more To be the envy'd bride  Of noble Morcar first of England's peers  In fame and fortune  MATILDA  Never trust my Bertha  To outward shew 'Tis not the smiles of fortune  The pomp of wealth or splendor of a court  Can make us happy In the mind alone  Rests solid joy and true felicity  Which I can never taste For O my friend  A secret sorrow weighs upon my heart  BERTHA  Then pour it in the bosom of thy friend  Let me partake it with thee  MATILDA  Gen'rous maid  Know then for nought will I conceal from thee  I honour Mercia's Earl revere his virtues  And wish I cou'd repay him with myself  But blushing I acknowledge it the heart  His vows solicit is not mine to give  BERTHA  Has then Tome happier youth  MATILDA  Another time  I'll tell thee all the story of our loves  But O my Bertha did'st thou know to whom  My virgin faith is plighted thou wou'd'st say  I am indeed unhappy  BERTHA  Cou'd Matilda  Bestow the treasure of her heart on one  Unworthy of her choice  MATILDA  Unworthy No  I glory in my passion for the best  The loveliest of his sex O he was all  That bounteous nature prodigal of charms  Did on her choicest fav'rite e'er bestow  His graceful form and sweet deportment spoke  The fairer beauties of his kindred soul  Where e'vry grace and ev'ry virtue shone  But thou wilt tremble Bertha when I tell thee  He is Earl Morcar'sbrother  BERTHA  Ha his brother  The noble Edwin Often have I heard  My father  MATILDA  Did Lord Edrick know him then  BERTHA  He knew his virtues and his fame in arms  And often wou'd lament the dire effects  Of civil discord that cou'd thus dissolve  The ties of nature and of brethren make  The bitt'rest foes If right I learn Lord Edwin  Is William's firmest friend and still supports  His royal master  MATILDA  Yes my Bertha there  I still find comfort Edwin ne'er was stain'd  As Morcar is with foul disloyalty  But stands betwixt his sov'reign and the rage  Of rebel multitudes to guard his throne  If nobly fighting in his country's cause  My hero falls I shall not weep alone  The king he lov'd and honour'd will lament him  And grateful England mix her tears with mine  BERTHA  And doth Earl Morcar know of Edwin's love  MATILDA  O no I wou'd not for a thousand worlds  He shou'd suspect it lest his fiery soul  Shou'd catch th' alarm and kindle to a flame  That might destroy us all  BERTHA  I know his warmth  And vehemence of temper unrestrain'd  By laws and spurning at the royal pow'r  Which he contemns he rules despotic here  MATILDA  Alas how man from man and brother oft  From brother differs Edwin's tender passion  Is soft and gentle as the balmy breath  Of vernal zephyrs whilst the savage north  That curls the angry ocean into storms  Is a faint image of Earl Morcar's love  'Tis rage 'tis fury all When last we met  He knit his angry brow and frown'd severe  Upon me then with wild distracted look  Bade me beware of trifling with his passion  He wou'd not brook ittrembling I retir'd  And bath'd my couch in tears  BERTHA  Unhappy maid  But time that softens ev'ry human woe  Will bring some blest event and lighten thine  MATILDA  Alas thou know'st not what it is to love  Haply thy tender heart hath never felt  The tortures of that soulbewitching passion  Its joys are sweet and poignant but its pangs  Are exquisite as I have known too well  For O my Bertha since the fatal hour  When Edwin left me never hath sweet peace  That us'd to dwell with all its comforts here  'E'er deign'd to visit this afflicted breast  BERTHA  Too plain alas I read thy sorrows grief  Sits in sad triumph on thy faded cheek  And half obscures the lustre of thy beauties  MATILDA  Talk not of beauty 'tis our sex's bane  And leads but to destruction I abhor  The fatal gift O would it had pleas'd heav'n  To brand my homely features with the mark  Of foul deformity or let me pass  Unknown and undistinguish'd from the herd  Of vulgar forms save by the partial eye  Of my lov'd Edwin then had I been blest  With charms unenvy'd and a guiltless love  BERTHA  Where is thy Edwin now  MATILDA  Alas I know not  'Tis now three years since last these eyes beheld  Their dearest object In that humble vale  Whence as I told thee Malcolm's fury drove me  There first we met O how I cherish still  The fond remembrance There we first exchang'd  Our mutual vows the day of happiness  Was fixt it came and in a few short hours  He had been made indissolubly mine  When fortune envious of our happiness  And William's danger call'd him to the field  BERTHA  And since that parting have ye never met  MATILDA  O never Bertha never but in thought  Imagination kind anticipator  Of love's pleasures brings us oft' together  Oft' as I sit within my lonely tent  And cast my wishful eyes o'er yonder plain  In ev'ry passing traveller I strive  To trace his image hear his lovely voice  In ev'ry sound and fain wou'd flatter me  Edwin still lives still loves his lost Matilda  BERTHA  Who knows but fate propitious to thy love  May guide him hither  MATILDA  Gracious heav'n forbid  Consider Bertha if the chance of war  Shou'd this way lead him he must come in arms  Against his brother Oh 'tis horrible  To think on Shou'd they meet and Edwin fall  What shall support me And if vict'ry smiles  Upon my love how dear will be the purchase  By Morcar's blood Then must I lose my friend  My guardian my protectorev'ry way  Matilda must be wretched  BERTHA  Is there ought  In Bertha's pow'r  MATILDA  Wilt thou dispatch my friend  Some trusty messenger with theseAway  gives her letters  I'll meet thee in my tentfarewel  Exit Bertha  MATILDA  alone  Mean time  One hope remains the gen'rous Siwardhe  Might save me still His sympathetic heart  Can feel for the afflictedI have heard  Such is the magic pow'r of sacred friendship  When the impetuous Morcar scatters fear  And terror round him he and he alone  Can stem the rapid torrent of his passion  And bend him tho' reluctant to his will  And see in happy hour he comes this way  Now fortune be propitious if there be  As I have heard an eloquence in grief  And those can most persuade who are most wretched  I shall not pass unpitied  Enter SIWARD  SIWARD  Ha in tears  Matilda What new grief what cruel foe  To innocence and beauty thus cou'd vex  Thy gentle spirit  MATILDA  Canst thou ask the cause  When thou behold'st me still in shameful bonds  A wretched captive friendless and forlorn  Without one ray of hope to sooth my sorrows  SIWARD  Can she whose beauteous form and fair demeanor  Charm ev'ry eye and conquer ev'ry heart  Can she be wretched can she want a friend  Whom Siward honours and whom Morcar loves  O if thou knew'st with what unceasing ardor  What unexampled tenderness and truth  He doats upon thee sure thou might'st be wrought  At least to pity  MATILDA  Urge no more my Lord  Th' ungrateful subject but too well I know  How much thy friend deserves how much alas  I owe himIf it be Earl Morcar's wish  To make me happy why am I detain'd  A pris'ner here Spight of his solemn promise  He would restore me to my royal master  Or send me back to the desiring arms  Of the afflicted Ranulph who in tears  Of bitt'rest anguish mourns his longlost daughter  Surely my Lord it ill becomes a soldier  To forfeit thus his honor and his word  SIWARD  I own it yet the cause pleads strongly for him  If by thy own too pow'rful charms misled  He deviates from the paths of rigid honour  Matilda might forgive Thou know'st he lives  But in thy smiles his loveenchanted soul  Hangs on those beauties he wou'd wish to keep  For ever in his sight  MATILDA  Indulgent heav'n  Keep me for ever from it O my Lord  If e'er thy heart with gen'rous pity glow'd  For the distress'd if e'er thy honest zeal  Cou'd boast an influence o'er the man you love  O now exert thy pow'r assist direct  And save thy friend from ruin and Matilda  There are my Lord who most offend where most  They wish to please Such often is the fate  Of thy unhappy friend when he pours forth  His ardent soul in vows of tend'rest passion  'Tis with such rude and boist'rous violence  As suits but ill the hero or the lover  SIWARD  I know his weakness know his follies all  And feel 'em but too well He loves with transport  And hates with fury Warm'd with fierce desire  Or strong resentment his impetuous soul  Is hurried on 'till reason quits her seat  And passion takes the looselyflowing rein  Then all is rage confusion and despair  And yet  remov'd  The veil of error he will weep his faults  With such a sweet contrition as wou'd melt  The hardest heart to pity and forgiveness  O he has virtues that may well attone  For all his venial rashness that deserve  A sov'reign's love and claim a nation's praise  Virtues that merit happiness and thee  Why wilt thou thus despise my noble friend  His birth and fortune with the rank he bears  Amongst the first of England's peers will raise thee  As far above thy sex in wealth and pow'r  As now thou art in beauty  MATILDA  O my Lord  'Tis not the pride the luxury of life  The splendid robe and glitt'ring gem that knits  The lasting bonds of mutual happiness  Where manners differ where affections jarr  And will not kindly mix together where  The sweet harmonious concord of the mind  Is wanting all is misery and woe  SIWARD  By heav'n thou plead'st thy own and virtue's cause  With such bewitching eloquence the more  Thy heart alarm'd by diffidence still urges  Against this union with my friend the more  I wish to see him blest with worth like thine  MATILDA  My Lord it must not be for grant him all  The fair perfections you already see  And I cou'd wish to find there is a bar  That must for ever disunite usBorn  Of Norman race and from my earliest years  Attach'd to William's cause I love my king  And wish my country's peace That king my Lord  Whom Morcar wishes to dethrone that peace  Which he destroys Had he an angel's form  With all the virtues that adorn his sex  With all the riches fortune can bestow  I wou'd not wed a traitor  SIWARD  Call not his errors by so harsh a name  He has been deeply wrong'd and souls like his  Must feel the wounds of honour and resent them  Alas with thee I weep my country's fate  Nay wish perhaps as well to William's cause  And England's peace as can the loyal daughter  Of gallant Ranulph and wou'd therefore joy  To see Matilda lend a gracious ear  To Morcar's suit Thy reconciling charms  Might sooth his troubled soul might heal the wounds  Of bleeding England and unite us all  In one bright chain of harmony and love  The gallant Edwin too  MATILDA  Ha what of him  Know'st thou that noble youth  SIWARD  So many years  Have past since last we met by diff'rent views  And our unhappy feuds so long divided  I shou'd not recollect him but report  Speaks loudly of his virtues He no doubt  If yet he lives  MATILDA  Yet livesWhy what my Lord  SIWARD  You seem much mov'd  MATILDA  Forgive me but whene'er  This sad idea rises to my mind  Of brother against brother arm'd my soul  Recoils with horror  SIWARD  'Tis a dreadful thought  Wou'd I cou'd heal that cruel breach but then  Thou might'st do much the task is left for thee  MATILDA  For me Alas it is not in my pow'r  SIWARD  In thine and thine alone O think Matilda  How great thy glory and how great thy praise  To be the blessed instrument of peace  The band of union 'twixt contending brothers  Thou see'st them now like two descending floods  Whose rapid torrents meeting half o'erwhelm  The neighb'ring plains Thy gentle voice might still  The angry waves and bid their waters flow  In one united stream to bless the land  MATILDA  That flatt'ring thought beams comfort on my soul  Amidst my sorrows bear me witness heav'n  Cou'd poor Matilda be the happy means  Of reconcilement Cou'd these eyes behold  The noble youths embracing and embrac'd  In the firm cords of amity and love  O it wou'd make me ample recompence  For all my griefs nor wou'd I more complain  But rest me in the silent grave well pleas'd  To think at last I had not liv'd in vain  SIWARD  Cherish that virtuous thought illustrious maid  And let me hope my friend may still be happy  MATILDA  I wish it from my soul But see my Lord  Earl Morcar comes this way with hasty steps  Across the lawn I must retire Farewel  You'll not forget my humble suit  SIWARD  O no  I will do all that loveliest innocence  And worth like thine deserve Farewel Mean time  Remember Siward's ev'ry wish the bliss  Of Morcar Edwin's life the public peace  And England's welfare all dependon thee  Exit Matilda  SIWARD  alone  There's no alternative but this my friend  Must quit Matilda or desert the cause  We've rashly promis'd to supportPerhaps  The last were bestboth shall be try'dhe comes  Enter MORCAR  MORCAR  O Siward was not that  The fair Matilda whom you parted from  SIWARD  It was  MORCAR  What says she the dear cruel maid  Is she still deaf inexorable still  SIWARD  You must not think of her  MORCAR  What say'st thou Siward  Not think of her  SIWARD  No Root her from thy heart  And gaze no more I blush to see my friend  So lost to honour Is it for a man  On whom the fate of England may depend  To quit the dang'rous post where duty calls  And all the bus'ness of the war to sigh  And whine in corners for a captive woman  Resume the hero Morcar and subdue  This idle passion  MORCAR  Talk not thus of love  The great refiner of the human heart  The source of all that's great of all that's good  Of joy of pleasureIf it be a weakness  It is a weakness which the best have felt  I wou'd not wish to be a stranger to it  SIWARD  Let me entreat thee if thou valuest life  Or fame or honour quit Matilda  MORCAR  Yes  I thank you for your council 'Tis th'advice  Of cold unfeeling wisdom kindly meant  To make me prudent and to leave me wretched  But thus it is that proud exulting health  Is ever ready to prescribe a cure  For pain and sickness which it never knew  SIWARD  There too thou err'st for I have known its joys  And sorrows too In early life I lost  The partner of my soul E'er since that hour  I bade adieu to love and taught my soul  To offer her devotions at the shrine  Of sacred friendship there  my  vows are paid  Morcar best knows the idol of my worship  MORCAR  I know and love thee for it But O my friend  I cannot force this tyrant from my breast  E'en now I feel her here she sits enthron'd  Within the foldings of my heart and he  Who tears her thence must draw the lifeblood from me  My morning slumbers and my midnight dreams  Are haunted by Matilda  SIWARD  To be thus  The slave of one that scorns thee O 'tis base  Mean and unworthy of thee  MORCAR  I will bear  That scorn no longer Thou hast rous'd me Siward  I will enjoy the glorious prize she's mine  By right of conquest mine I will assert  A victor's claim and force her to be happy  SIWARD  That must not be It ill becomes the man  Who takes up arms against a tyrant's pow'r  T'adopt a tyrant's maxims force and love  Are terms that never can be reconcil'd  You will not must not do it  MORCAR  Must not who  Shall dare oppose me  SIWARD  Honour conscience love  The sense of shame your virtue and your friend  Whilst I have life or pow'r I will not see  Matilda wrong'd  MORCAR  You are her champion then  It seems her favour'd happy friend perhaps  Her fond admirer too I'llfated Morcar  I see it but too well I'm lost abandon'd  Alike betray'd by friendship and by love  I thank you Sir you have perform'd your office  And merit your reward  SIWARD  Unkind reproach  Did I for this desert my Sov'reign's cause  My peaceful home and all its joys to serve  Ungrateful Morcar Why did I rebel  The haughty William never injur'd me  For thee alone I fought for thee I conquer'd  And but for thee long since I had employ'd  My gallant soldiers to a nobler purpose  Than loit'ring thus in idle camp to hear  A lovesick tale and sooth a mad man's phrenzy  MORCAR  You could Away and leave me then Withdraw  Your boasted aid and bid Northumbria's sons  Bend to the tyrant's yoke whilst I alone  Defend the cause of freedom and my country  Here let us part Remove your loiterers  And join th'usurper  SIWARD  Mark the diff'rence now  Betwixt blind passion and undaunted friendship  You are impatient of the keen reproof  Because you merit I can bear it all  Because I've not deserv'd it  Enter an OFFICER  OFFICER  Good my Lords  Forgive this rough intrusion but the danger  I trust will plead my pardon As I watch'd  From yonder tow'r a dusky cloud appear'd  As if from distant troops advancing soon  I saw their armour glitter in the sun  With rapid motion they approach'd each moment  We must expect them here  SIWARD  Why let 'em come  Already I have order'd fit disposal  Of all our little force Away good Osmond  Be silent and be ready  Exit Officer  Now my friend  Thou art as welcome to thy Siward's breast  As dear as everWhen the man I love  Walks in the paths of error I reprove him  With honest freedom but when danger comes  Upon him I forget his faults and flee  With all a lover's ardour to his rescue  His sorrows and his wants alone remember'd  And all his follies buried in oblivion  MORCAR  Thou hast disarm'd me now This pierces more  Than all the bitter poison of reproach  Which thou hast pour'd upon me O 'twas treason  Against the sacred majesty of friendship  To doubt thy honour or suspect thy virtue  Thou wilt forgive But when the wounded mind  Is torn with passion ev'ry touch is pain  You should not probe so deeply  SIWARD  'Twas my duty  But come no more of that The foe advances  If we succeed as my prophetic soul  Foretells we shallI have some comfort for you  If not we'll borrow courage from despair  And die like men Thou stand'st upon the rock  Of danger and the yawning precipice  Opens before us I will snatch thee from it  Or leap the gulph and perish with my friend  The End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE a Fortress belonging to MORCAR  EDWIN alone in chains  EDWIN  IT is the will of heav'n and must be done  The hardfought field is lost and here I am  A pris'ner in my brother's camp alas  That fortune thus shou'd guide me to a foe  Whom most I wish'd to shun We little thought  The troops by Morcar led had this way bent  Their illdirected course but providence  Hath so ordain'd perhaps to heal the wounds  Of civil discord O unhappy Edwin  For what art thou reserv'd No matter what  Since fate depriv'd me of my dear Matilda  Whom I for three long years have sought in vain  Life hath been irksome to me this perchance  May end itFor who knows if nature yet  May live within the conqu'ror's breast to plead  A brother's pardon  Yet he knows me not  But soon he mustHa who comes here Earl Siward  The second in command to whom o'erpower'd  By circling foes and fainting with my wounds  I yielded up my sword If fame say true  He bears a mind too great to look with scorn  On the oppress'd or triumph o'er misfortune  Enter SIWARD  SIWARD  Stranger whoe'er thou art be comforted  Thy fate hath thrown thee into noble hands  Who know thy merit May I ask thy name  EDWIN  I am a poor abandon'd wretch the sport  Of fortune one whose least affliction is  To be a captive and from ev'ry eye  Wou'd wish to hide the story of my fate  Too soon my name and sorrows will be known  SIWARD  Respect is ever due to misery  I will not urge thee further all I hope  That gen'rous pity could afford to sooth  Calamity like thine by my command  Hath been extended to thee Here awhile  You must remain a pris'ner but e'er long  I hope to greet thee by a fairer name  And rank thee as our friend  EDWIN  Your genr'ous orders  Have been obey'd and I acknowledge it  With grateful heart May I not ask the fate  Of him who fought so nobly by my side  That brave old man  SIWARD  The gallant Ranulph  EDWIN  Yes  My fellow captive  SIWARD  He is safe and free  EDWIN  Ha free Thank heav'n  SIWARD  The gen'rous Morcar urg'd  By my entreaties pardon'd and releas'd him  Tho' much our soldiers murmur'd and demanded  His life and your's a sacrifice they said  Due to the manes of their slaughter'd friends  But mercy has prevail'd  EDWIN  What e'er becomes  Of an unhappy wanderer like me  For your kind treatment of the aged Ranulph  Accept my thanks it was a precious boon  Morcar may find me not unworthy of it  To day I am his captive but tomorrow  May see me his deliverer for know  My royal master the victorious William  With eagle swiftness soon will follow me  With twenty times your force As this shall prove  Or true or false so deal with me remember  I warn'd you of it  SIWARD  And remember thou  That I with joy receive the welcome news  Welcome to me for I am William's friend  EDWIN  Thou can'st not then be mine or England's foe  With such a heart as thine so nobly form'd  To feel for the afflicted satisfy'd  For thou seem'st of William's royal right  What cou'd engage thee in this foul revolt  This base rebellion  SIWARD  What but the great bond  Of kindred souls inviolable friendship  The only solid bliss on this side heav'n  That doubles all the joys of human life  And by dividing lessens ev'ry woe  EDWIN  Who knows but this day's sad event may prove  The happy means to heal a nation's wounds  And sooth our jarring factions into peace  SIWARD  Had Morcar thought with me lond since that end  Had been obtain'd but Morcar is  EDWIN  Inexorable  So I have heard and therefore little hope  To change his nature O cou'd he be wrought  To sweet oblivion of his wrongs to bury  His deep resentment Mine shou'd be the task  A task heav'n knows I wou'd with joy perform  To reconcile offended majesty  To soften all his errors plead his pardon  And give my sov'reign one brave soldier more  SIWARD  When next we meet I trust it shall be so  Mean time let me prepare him for the change  Retire a whilee'er long we'll send for thee  For ev'ry moment I expect him here  Thy freedom and thy happiness shall be  My first concern for thou hast well deserv'd it  EDWIN  Farewel Be quick in your resolves the time  Requires it and be wise e'er 'tis too late  Exit Edwin  SIWARD  alone  I hope we shall This welltim'd victory  If rightly us'd may smooth our way to peace  Now Morcar all thy happiness depends  Upon thyself alone Now friendship raise  Thy pow'rful voice and force him to be happy  He will he musthe comes  Enter MORCAR  SIWARD  My conqu'ror welcome  MORCAR  Thrice welcome to my arms my noble Siward  At length we meet in joy the day is ours  Thanks to thy friendly aid  SIWARD  We must not boast  'Twas hardly purchas'd and has cost us dear  You follow'd 'em too close  MORCAR  I own 'twas rash  My youthful ardor urg'd the keen pusuit  Too far and but for thee I had been lost  In war thy arm protects me and in peace  Thy councils guide O how shall I return  Thy goodness Thou wer't born to save thy friend  SIWARD  Away I'll not be thank'd I've done my duty  And if thou think'st thyself indebted for it  Repay me not with flatt'ry but with love  E'er since my soul with thine congonial met  In social bands and mark'd thee for her own  Thy int'rest and thy happiness have been  My first ambition and when thou art blest  With all thy soul can wish for Siward then  And then alone will have his full reward  MORCAR  O unexampled faithfulness and truth  But say my Siward is our loss so great  SIWARD  The flow'r of half our troops But 'tis not now  A time to weep for I have glorious tidings  That much import thy happiness  MORCAR  Ha what  SIWARD  Know that amongst our captives I have ta'en  A noble prize will make us full amends  For ev'ry lossthe gallant Ranulph  MORCAR  Ha  Matilda's father then I'm satisfy'd  The wily chief by heav'n he shall repay me  For her unkindness Give him to my rage  To my resentment to my injur'd love  Where is he Siward  SIWARD  I have set him free  MORCAR  Ha free Thy illtim'd metey hath betray'd  Our cause The tyrant wou'd have ransom'd him  With half his kingdom  SIWARD  Still thy rapid passions  O'erpow'r thy reason What if it shou'd serve  A better purpose smooth thy paths to bliss  And gain Matilda for thee  MORCAR  O my friend  My Siward do not flatter me By heav'n  Her kind consent wou'd give my ravish'd soul  More true and heartfelt happiness than cou'd  A thousand vict'ries o'er the proud usurper  SIWARD  Know then I gave him liberty and life  On these conditionsThat he shou'd withdraw  His pow'rs from William's aid and never more  Assist his cause the time wou'd come I told him  That he shou'd know to whom he ow'd the boon  And how he might repay it  MORCAR  That was kind  Indeed my Siward that was like a friend  O thou reviv'st my drooping heart but tell me  Did my Matilda let me call her mine  Did she acknowledge did she thank thee for it  SIWARD  O I assum'd no merit but to thee  And to thy gen'rous unexampled love  Did I attribute all She sigh'd and wept  Pour'd forth a thousand blessings on thy head  MORCAR  And do'st thou think my Siward that one ray  Of hope remains  SIWARD  The clouds already vanish  The prospect brightens round thee haste and seize  The lucky moment When the gen'rous mind  Is sooth'd by obligation soon it opens  To the mild dictates of humanity  And softens into sympathy and love  MORCAR  O Siward cou'd'st thou teach me but to win  That lovely maid  SIWARD  The task is half perform'd  Already and my friend shall soon be bless'd  One thing and one alone remains to fix  Her doubtful heart if yet a doubt remains  MORCAR  O name it Siward if 'tis in the pow'r  Of wealth to purchase or of victory  In the fair field of glory to acquire  It shall not long be wanting  SIWARD  It requires  No price but such as Morcar well can pay  No vict'ry but the vict'ry o'er thyself  And thy own passionsGive up thy resentment  Make peace with William and Matilda's thine  MORCAR  Matilda mine and must I purchase her  At the dear price of honour with the loss  Of all my soul holds dear my country's welfare  My word  SIWARD  Away whilst prudence warranted  Our honest zeal I was the first to aid  Thy just revenge but valour illadvis'd  And illexerted in a hopeless cause  Degen'rate into rashness You mistake  The pride of honour for the pride of virtue  MORCAR  And wou'd'st thou have me bend beneath the yoke  Of ignominious slav'ry quit the cause  Of heav'nborn freedom and betray my friends  SIWARD  I'd have thee just and happyWe have been  Successful let us now be generous  Whilst we have something to bestow nor wait  'Till fickle fortune from our brows shall tear  The blasted wreath and leave us nought to give  Too long already have we sacrific'd  At proud ambition's altar to revenge  Now let us offer at the shrine of peace  And sacrifice  MORCAR  To love and to Matilda  It shall be sothe struggle's pastaway  My Siward haste and tell her I obey  Her laws her king her master shall be mine  I have no will but her's and in her eyes  Will read my dutyYet a moment stay  What will my brave companions of the war  My fellow soldiers say Will they approve  This unexpected change  SIWARD  I know them firm  In their obedience and resolv'd to act  As you commandBut I will see 'em strait  And urge such pow'rful reasons as may best  Secure them to our purpose Fare thee well  MORCAR  Siward thy kind anticipating care  Prevents my ev'ry wishBut say my friend  Where is the gallant chief whom we subdu'd  Who fought so hardly and so nobly fell  SIWARD  In yonder tent a wretched pris'ner still  He counts the tedious hours a heavy gloom  Sits on his brow as if some deepfelt sorrow  Oppress'd his noble mindWe must release him  MORCAR  Thou know'st my Siward thrice we had o'erpow'r'd  His troops and thrice his single valour turn'd  The fortune of the day Since first I trod  The paths of glory ne'er did I behold  Such deeds of valour wrought by mortal hand  I almost envy'd tho' I conquer'd him  He wore his beaver up nor cou'd I trace  His features but he bears a noble form  Know'st thou his quality or name  SIWARD  Not yet  He seems industrious to conceal them both  From ev'ry eye  MORCAR  Some deity protects him  As its peculiar care for as I rais'd  My sword against him whether the soft passion  That triumphs o'er me had unmann'd my soul  I know not but bereft of all its pow'r  My nerveless arm dropp'd ineffectual down  And let him 'scape me  SIWARD  'Tis most true I saw  And wonder'd at it When you lest the field  With desp'rate rage he rush'd intrepid on  And seem'd to court his fate till circling foes  Compell'd him to resign and yield his sword  MORCAR  Away I burn with ardor to forgive  To free and to embrace him fly my Siward  Let him approach he cou'd not wish to meet  In happier hour the master of his fate  For now methinks I cou'd be reconcil'd  To ev'ry foe Away my Siward haste  And send him to me  SIWARD  Treat him like a friend  He may be useful Such distinguish'd merit  Must have its influence he commands no doubt  The royal ear and may procure such terms  As William may with honour yield and we  Without a blush accept  Exit Siward  MORCAR  alone  Farewel And now  How stands the great account Can I acquit  Myself or shall I be condemn'd before  Thy great tribunal allrepaying justice  But fair Matilda wipes out ev'ry stain  'Tis she commands me to forgive and she  Must be obey'd I'm not the first apostate  From honour's cause the tyrant love has made  My friend too urg'd the change  Guards bring in Edwin chained  He's hereStrike off  Those ignominious chainshe has deserv'd  A better fate  Guards unchain him  Stranger who e'er thou art  turning to Edwin  Thy gallant bearing in th' unequal conflict  For we had twice thy numbers hath endear'd  A soldier to a soldier Vulgar minds  To their own party and the narrow limits  Of partial friendship meanly may confine  Their admiration but the brave will see  And seeing praise the virtues of a foe  EDWIN  aside  O pow'rful nature how thou work'st within me  MORCAR  Still silent still conceal'd perchance thou fear'st  Knowing thy rank and name I might recal  My promis'd pardon but be confident  For by that sacred honour which I hold  Dearer than life I promise here to free  And to protect thee did'st thou hide from me  My deadliest foe Shou'd William's self appear  Before me he who hath so deeply wrong'd me  So long oppos'd Nay shou'd I hear the voice  Of that advent'rous rash misguided youth  Whom yet I cannot hatemy cruel brother  I cou'd forgive him  EDWIN  discovering himself  Thenbehold him here  MORCAR  Edwin Amazement By what wond'rous means  Mysterious providence do'st thou unfold  Thy secret purposes I little thought  When last we met what heav'nprotected victim  Escap'd my sword  EDWIN  With horror I recal  The dreadful circumstance Throughout the battle  I knew and carefully avoided thee  MORCAR  O Edwin how on this propitious day  Have vict'ry fame and friendship fortune love  And nature all conspir'd to make me blest  We have been foes too longOf that no more  My Edwin welcome Once more to thy arms  Receive a brother  EDWIN  Yet a moment stay  By nature touch'd the same accordant string  That vibrates on thy heart now beats on mine  But honour and the duty which I owe  The best of kings restrains the fond embrace  I wish to share and bids me ask if yet  In Morcar I behold my sov'reign's foe  If it be so take back thy proffer'd freedom  Take back my forfeit life I wou'd not wish  To be indebted for it toa traitor  MORCAR  Perhaps I may deserve a better name  Perhaps I may be chang'd  EDWIN  I hope thou art  For this I came for this I yielded to thee  To tell thee William's strength is ev'ry hour  Increasing if thou mean'st to make thy peace  Now is the crisis  MORCAR  Edwin stop nor urge  Such mean unworthy motives as alone  Cou'd thwart my purpose Morcar cannot fear  But Morcar can be gen'rous for know  Before I saw thee here I had resolv'd  To sheath my sword and be the conqu'ror's friend  For O there is a cause  EDWIN  Whate'er the cause  Th' effect is glorious Now thou art again  My brother Here let us once more unite  The longdissever'd cord  They embrace  MORCAR  And never more  May blind resentment faction party rage  Envy or jealous fear dissolve the tye  And now my Edwin blushing I confess  Not to thy tender care for Morcar's safety  To friendship's council or to reason's voice  Owe we this wish'd for change A female hand  Directs and wills it  EDWIN  Ha a woman  MORCAR  Yes  If such I ought to call that form divine  Which triumphs here who rules my ev'ry thought  My ev'ry action guides In yonder tent  A beauteous captive dwells who hath enslav'd  Her conqu'ror She demands the sacrifice  She wou'd not give her hand to William's foe  And therefore only Morcar is his friend  EDWIN  I cou'd have wish'd that this important change  Were to the hero not the lover due  MORCAR  I am above deceit and own my weakness  But thou shalt see herYes my Edwin thou  Shalt bear the welcome tidings to my love  Thy presence will bear witness to the change  Thy freedom and the joyful news thou bring'st  Of our blest union will confirm it to her  Wilt thou my Edwin  EDWIN  Do not ask me what  I must refuse I wou'd do much to serve  A friend and brother but a task of joy  Ill suits a soul oppress'd with griefs like mine  O I cou'd tell theebut 'twou'd be unkind  When thou art ent'ring on the paths of bliss  To stop thee with my melancholy tale  MORCAR  What e'er thy griefs I pity and hereafter  May find the means to lessen or remove them  Mean time this tender office may divert  Thy sorrows nay if thou deny'st me Edwin  I shall not think our union is sincere  EDWIN  Then be it so  MORCAR  I'll send a trusty slave  That shall conduct thee to her Soon I mean  To follow theeawaybegone and prosper  But O my brother if thou hast a heart  That is not steel'd with stoic apathy  Against the magic of allconqu'ring love  Beware of beauty's pow'r for she has charms  Wou'd melt the frozen breast of hoary age  Or draw the lonely hermit from his cell  To gaze upon her  EDWIN  Know thy fears are vain  For long long since by honor's sacred tyes  United to the lovliest of her sex  Edwin like Morcar is to one alone  Devoted  and my  heart is fix'd as thine  MORCAR  Then I am blest Thy sympathetic soul  With warmer feelings shall express  my  passion  Wak'd by the fond remembrance of thy  own  Go then thy kind returning friendship prove  Go plead with all the eloquence of love  And as thou do'st thy brother's anguish tell  Still on thy lips may soft persuasion dwell  Urge my fond suit with energy divine  Nor cease till thou hast made the lovely captive mine  The End of the Second Act  ACT III  SCENE MATILDA's Tent with a distant view of the Camp  MATILDA BERTHA  MATILDA  O Bertha I have had such frightful dreams  They harrow'd up my soul  BERTHA  It is the work  Of busy fancy in thy troubled mind  Give it no heed  MATILDA  O it was more much more  Than fancy ever form'd 'twas real all  It haunts me still and ev'ry circumstance  Is now before me but I'll tell thee all  Scarce had I clos'd my eyes to seek that rest  Which long had been a stranger when methought  Alone I wander'd thro' a mazy wood  Beset with thorns and briars on ev'ry side  The mournful image of my wretched state  When from a winding walk the beauteous form  Of my lov'd Edwin seem'd to glide across  And ran with haste to meet me But behold  A tyger rush'd between and seiz'd upon him  I shriek'd aloud  BERTHA  'Twas terrible  MATILDA  But mark  What follow'd for a gleam of light broke in  And sav'd me from despair When 'cross the glade  A gen'rous lyon as with pity mov'd  At the unequal conflict darted forth  And sprung with vengeance on the spotted beast  Who turn'd with fury on his nat'ral foe  And loos'd my Edwin he escap'd and fled  I wak'd in agonies  BERTHA  Be comforted  The dream presages good Some gen'rous friend  Shall save him from the perils of the war  And give him to thy longing arms again  MATILDA  O never never  Enter an OFFICER  OFFICER  Noble lady one  From William's camp by Morcar's orders sent  Wou'd crave a minute's conference and says  He bears some news that may be welcome  MATILDA  Ha  From William's camp O flatt'ring hope who knows  But he may bring some tidings of my love  Tidings perhaps I may not wish to hear  Perhaps he comes to speak of Edwin's death  Or Edwin's falshoodBe it as it may  I cannot be more wretched than I am  Conduct him hither  Exit Officer  O my flutt'ring heart  Look yonder how imagination forms  What most we wish for see he comesIt is  It is my EdwinSave me Bertha O  as he enters she faints  Enter EDWIN  EDWIN  What do I see Matilda here she faints  Am I deserted then abandon'd lost  Betray'd by her I love She breathes she lives  But not for mefor Morcar for my brother  MATILDA  to Bertha  Where is he O it was delusion all  The form deceiv'd me Had it been my love  He wou'd have flown with rapture to meSee  He stands far off and will not look upon me  EDWIN  I dare not  MATILDA  Is it thus we meet again  Is this the kind the tender faithful Edwin  EDWIN  Art thou Matilda Speak for I am lost  In wild astonishment It cannot be  In Morcar's camp Is this the lovely captive  That I shou'd meet  MATILDA  Allseeing heav'n  Bear witness for me If from that sad hour  When last we parted this devoted heart  Hath ever wander'd ever cast one thought  Or form'd a wish for any bliss but thee  Despise me Edwin slight me cast me off  To infamy and shame  EDWIN  I must I must  Believe thee Yet 'tis strangewhen thou shalt know  From whom I came and what my errand here  Thou wilt not call me cruel or unkind  When I shall tell thee I am come to claim  Another's right O heav'n another's right  To my Matilda to request thy hand  For Morcar  MATILDA  For thy brother  EDWIN  Yes ev'n now  We partedHere he told me I should meet  A beauteous captive little did I think  It was Matilda whom he long had woo'd  Whose gen'rous heart he hop'd wou'd now accept  A convert made to loyalty by love  She only waited for that blest event  With mutual ardour to return his passion  Can it be thus Alas thy presence here  Confirms it but too well  MATILDA  Appearance oft  By strange events and causeless jealousy  Confounds the guilty with the innocent  But sure my Edwin's noble mind disdains  To cherish low suspicion 'tis a vice  Abhorrent to thy nature and Matilda  Will never practice it on thee True love  Knows not distrust or diffidence but rests  On its own faith secure and hopes to meet  The truth it merits  EDWIN  Can this be the voice  Of falshoodCan those lips  MATIDLA  Mistaken man  Cou'dst thou e'er credit the delusive tale  Cou'dst thou believe I had so soon forgot  My plighted faith But since I am suspected  Return and bear this answer back to Morcar  First say I thank him for the choice he made  Of thee to be the herald of his love  For what is there Matilda can refuse  That Edwin could request  EDWIN  O that recalls  A thousand tender thoughts  MATILDA  Go tell him too  What e'er I rashly promis'd but to gain  A few short moments to preserve my king  And save a father's life I never meant  To feign a passion which I coud not feel  For I was destin'd to another's arms  To one who now regardless of his vows  To poor Matilda after three long years  Of cruel absence from her comes at last  To doubt her honor and suspect her love  EDWIN  O never never Sooner will I doubt  The pow'rs of nature and believe these eyes  Can misinterpret ev'ry object here  Than think thee false O take me to thy arms  And bury all my doubtsCan'st thou forgive  The jealous warmth of agonizing passion  MATILDA  I can I must But say to what blest chance  Am I indebted for this happy moment  EDWIN  The chance of war I am a pris'ner here  And but for thee  MATILDA  When I shall tell thee all  That I have suffer'd since we parted last  Thou wilt not blame but pity poor Matilda  Mean while be calm it is not now a time  For idle doubts and visionary fears  When real dangers threat I see already  By thy imperfect tale what misery  Must soon await us when the fiery Earl  Shall know this strange event  EDWIN  And wherefore know it  Why not conceal our passion till some means  Of freedom offer  MATILDA  I abhor the thought  No Edwin no The crisis of our fate  Approaches Never let us stain our loves  With crooked fraud and base dissimulation  Hark did'st thou hear a voice in yonder grove  Siward in conf'rence with the haughty Earl  Behold themseethey partand Morcar hastes  With quick impatient step to know his fate  Now summon all thy pow'rs  EDWIN  I am prepar'd  He comes a few short minutes will determine  Whether Matilda plays the hypocrite  Or is deserving of her Edwin's love  Enter MORCAR  MORCAR  At length I hope Matilda's satisfy'd  Edwin has told thee what a sacrifice  My heart hath made Ambition glory pride  And fierce resentment bend beneath thy pow'r  And yield the palm to allsubduing love  Yes thou hast conquer'd I am William's friend  The struggle's past I have perform'd the task  Assign'd and come to claim my just reward  MATILDA  By virtuous acts the selfapproving mind  Is amply paid nor seeks a recompence  From ought beside You have redeem'd your honor  Turn'd to the paths of duty and discharg'd  The debt you owe your country and your king  England and William will be grateful for it  What can you wish for more  MORCAR  There is a prize  More welcome far beyond what e'er a king  Or kingdom can bestowthy love  MATILDA  My lord  MORCAR  If to have sav'd thee from the brutal rage  Of pitiless ruffians if to have renounc'd  A victor's claim and be myself the slave  Of her I conquer'd if to have releas'd  My bitt'rest foe because ally'd to thee  If after all my cruel wrongs t' accept  The proud oppressor's hand can merit ought  I am not quite unworthy of the boon  MATILDA  The good and just my lord demand our praise  And gen'rous deeds will claim the tribute due  The debt of humble gratitude but love  Love that must mark the colour of our days  For good or ill for happiness or woe  'Tis not the gift of fortune or of fame  Nor earn'd by merit nor acquir'd by virtue  All the rich treasures which or wealth or pow'r  Have to bestow can never purchase that  Which the free heart alone itself must give  MORCAR  Give it with freedom then to him who most  Hath study'd to deserve  MATILDA  You talk my Lord  As if the right of conquest cou'd bestow  A right more precious and a dearer claim  But know for now 'tis time to throw aside  The veil that long hath hid from Morcar's eyes  The secret of my soul and say at last  I never can be thine  MORCAR  Ha Never O  Recal that word  MATILDA  I must not Edwin knows  There is a bar of adamant between  That must for ever part us  MORCAR  Ha for ever  Distraction can it be Take heed Matilda  I am not to be mock'd thus O my brother  Did'st thou not hear her But astonishment  Has clos'd thy lips in silenceNever mine  And wherefore not be mine  turning to Matilda  MATILDA  Because I am  Another'sWell I know our hapless sex  So custom wills and arbitrary man  Is taught in fearful silence to conceal  The honest feelings of a tender heart  Else wherefore shou'd Matilda blush to own  A virtuous passion for the best of men  MORCAR  A virtuous passion grant me patience heav'n  I am betray'd abandon'd lost Another's  Some fawning slave some Norman plunderer  Rich with the ravish'd spoils of English valour  Hath snar'd her easy heart and tortur'd mine  But I will drag him from his dark abode  Where e'er he lurks he shall not 'scape my veng'ance  Thou hear'st her Edwin  EDWIN  Aye Who wou'd not wish  To hear the voice of nature and of love  Thus nobly pleading by the lips of truth  MORCAR  Amazement Thou art link'd with the vile slave  That hath unsurp'd my right All all conspire  To make me wretched  EDWIN  Why shou'd Morcar think  That lovely maid wou'd act beneath herself  And make so mean a choice Now on my soul  I doubt not but the object of her love  Hath earn'd the glorious prize and will be found  Deserving of it  MORCAR  Thou know'st him then  EDWIN  I do  Know him as brave as noble as thyself  One who wou'd scorn howe'er the outward act  Might seem unworthy of him to do ought  That shou'd disgrace his family and name  A man he is of yet untainted honour  Of birth and valour equal to thy own  Though fortune frowns upon him  MORCAR  Now by heav'n  But that I know thy eyes were never blest  With my Matilda's charms I shou'd suspect  Thou hadst betray'd the sacred trust repos'd  In thy false heart by unsuspecting friendship  And wer't thyself the traitor  EDWIN  Think so still  Let fancy ever busy to torment  The jealous mind alarm thee with the thought  Of seeing him whom thou hast thus revil'd  Stand forth and dare the proof suppose him here  Before thee ready to assert his claim  His prior right to all the joys that love  And fair Matilda can bestow Then look  On me and know thy rival inthy brother  MORCAR  Confusion horror misery O heav'n  Can'st thou behold such complicated guilt  Such unexampled perfidy and yet  With hold thy vengeance Let thy light'nings blast  The base betrayer O Matilda false  Deceitful cruel woman  MATILDA  'Tis the lot  Of unprotected innocence to meet  The cruel censure which to guilt alone  Is due I've not deceiv'd I've not betray'd thee  And wou'd'st thou listen to the artless tale  I cou'd unfold  MORCAR  Away I will not hear  Nor see nor think of thee Deceitful villain  Was this thy kind concern for Morcar's safety  Was it for this that subtle Edwin came  A willing captive Boasted William's strength  And lur'd me no a base inglorious peace  That like a midnight ruffian he might steal  Unseen and unsuspected on my love  And rob me of Matilda  EDWIN  I abhor  A thought so mean the bare suspicion stains  With such foul blot my honour and my name  I will not deign to answer thee My birth  Alone might prove to any sense but thine  That I disdain it 'Tis enough to say  I am Earl Morcar's brother  MORCAR  I disclaim  All ties of nature or of friendship with thee  And henceforth hold thee as my deadliest foe  As such I will pursue thee slave for know  Thou art my pris'ner stillWho waits there Seize  And guard this traitor  Guards enter and seize on Edwin  MATILDA  kneeling to Morcar  O my lord if e'er  Soft pity touch'd thy breast if e'er thy heart  Felt the warm glow of sympathetic grief  For the unhappy do not let the rage  Of thoughtless passion urge thee to a deed  Of horror which too late thou wilt repent  O spare a guiltless brother spare thyself  The bitter pangs of sad remorse that soon  Shall harrow up thy soul when radient truth  Shall flash conviction on thee O forgive  And pity  EDWIN  Rise Matilda 'Tis beneath  The dignity of innocence to kneel  Before proud guilt and supplicate a tyrant  MATILDA  rising  I feel the just reproachForgive me Edwin  Henceforth I never will disgrace thy love  By mean submission Morcar if thou hop'st  For future peace or pardon set us free  MORCAR  I'll hear no more convey her to her tent  MATILDA  Edwin adieu If honour virtue truth  And mutual love protect the innocent  We yet shall meet in happinessfarewel  Exit Matilda guarded  MORCAR  Let none have entrance there but faithful Siward  Wou'd he were here that I might pour my sorrows  Into his friendly bosom O Siward  Where art thouHa he comes  Enter SIWARD  SIWARD  My Lord the troops  Flush'd with their late success refuse all terms  Of peace with William and cry out for war  And vengeance  MORCAR  They shall have it Now by heav'n  Thou bring'st me glorious tidingswell what more  SIWARD  They have discover'd that the noble pris'ner  Who had surrender'd is thy brother Edwin  This hath alarm'd them they suspect you both  Of vile collusion to betray their cause  And yield them to the tyrant If they say  You mean them fair let Edwin be confin'd  And answer for the treason with his life  MORCAR  And so he shall They cou'd not ask a boon  Which Morcar wou'd more readily bestow  Already their request is grantedSee  The traitor is secur'd Allseeing heav'n  Thou see'st how justice will o'ertake the wicked  SIWARD  What can this mean Since last I saw my friend  How the fair day that shone so bright upon us  Is suddenly o'ercast  MORCAR  Alas my Siward  When thou shalt knowbut 'tis enough to say  Matilda's false and Edwin isa villain  SIWARD  Amazement can it be  MORCAR  It is too true  And I am lost for ever O Matilda  Deceitful woman  SIWARD  'Tis not now a time  For idle plaints Consult your safety Fly  This moment to the campyour presence there  And that alone may quell the rising storm  Leave Edwin to my care  MORCAR  I go my Siward  Safe in thy friendship I entrust to thee  My just revenge Yon mossgrown tow'r that hangs  O'er the deep flood'tis under thy command  Place double guardhe must not 'scapehis fate  Shall be determin'd soon What e'er it prove  It cannot be more wretched than my own  Exit Mor  EDWIN SIWARD  EDWIN  pointing to the guards  Where is my dungeon My conductors here  Wait but your orders give 'em their commission  For you it seems Sir are to execute  The friendly office Do it and be happy  SIWARD  Guards set your pris'ner freeThou little know'st  Of Siward's soul to think it jo'ys in ought  That gives another pain I've learnt too well  In sad affliction's hard but wholesome school  The lesson of humanity  EDWIN  O gen'rous Siward if thou hast a heart  To feel for others mis'ries pity mine  And poor Matilda's She has not deserv'd  A fate like this  SIWARD  Alas it rives my soul  To see the tender bonds of amity  Thus torn asunder by the very means  I fondly thought for ever wou'd unite them  And the fair structure which my hopes had rais'd  Of love and friendship in a moment shrunk  From its weak base and bury'd all in ruin  If thou can'st prove thy innocence as yet  I hope thou wilt for in that noble mien  I read a conscious pride that wou'd not stoop  To ought that's baseStill may I hope to heal  These bleeding wounds and sooth him to forgiveness  Mean time be free Give me thy sacred word  The soldier's oath thou wilt be found when e'er  I call upon thee and yon tent alone  Shall be thy prison free to range around  Far as my guard extends  EDWIN  Accept my thanks  The humble tribute of a grateful heart  'Tis all I have to give The time may come  When Edwin shall repay thee as he ought  SIWARD  Is there ought more which honour and the duty  I owe my friend permits me to bestow  That thou wou'd'st as    EDWIN  O grant me to behold  That injur'd maid to take my last farewel  Then act as fate and Morcar shall determine  I give the pledge of safety thou requir'st  And will be foundspeak wilt thou listen to me  SIWARD  Of that we'll talk hereaftercomewithin  I'll hear thy storyThou but know'st me yet  As Morcar's friend hereafter thou may'st find  I am still more the friendof truth and virtue  The End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE An Apartment belonging to SIWARD opening to a wood  EDWIN MATILDA  EDWIN  THANKS to the noble Siward's gen'rous pity  For the distress'd once more we meet Matilda  But only meet alas to mourn our fate  To feel each others woes and to be wretched  MATILDA  Eternal blessings wait on him who thus  Cou'd sweeten sorrow's bitter draught and make  Captivity a blessing O my Edwin  A few short moments spent with those we love  Is worth an age of common life  EDWIN  With thee  Indeed it is but we are on the verge  Of a dark precipice and ev'ry step  Is dangerous If Morcar shou'd return  And find us here together we are lost  For ever thou hast seen and seen with horror  The desp'rate rage of his tumultuous soul  Let us avoid it let us  MATILDA  What my love  Thou art my guide protector guardian all  I have to boast on earth O teach me where  To find some blest asylum for my woes  And guide my footsteps to the paths of peace  EDWIN  Let me entreat thee then  MATILDA  O speak thou know'st  I have no will but thine  EDWIN  Then leave me

benignant pow'r  That led thee hither that beyond my hopes  Brought my lost Edwin to these arms again  Will still protect that virtue which it loves  EDWIN  Did'st thou not tell me that this very morn  Thou had'st determin'd as the only means  To shun my brother's love on sudden flight  MATILDA  But then I shou'd have fled in search of thee  EDWIN  Thou winning softness how shall I reward  Such unexampled tenderness and truth  MATILDA  By flying with me Come my love lead on  I'll follow thee to dangers and to death  Nor perils shall affright nor labours tire  When thou art with me  EDWIN  No It must not be  MATILDA  Why What shou'd keep thee here  EDWIN  The ties of honour  MATILDA  And are they stronger than the bonds of love  EDWIN  To Siward's kind indulgence well thou know'st  I owe this little interval of peace  This transient gleam of happiness with thee  And shou'd I break my sacred word his life  Might answer for it wou'd'st thou have me thus  Repay his kindness No my love I may  Be wretched but I cannot be ungrateful  MATILDA  Must thou return then to that hateful prison  When Morcar comes  EDWIN  I must O think when I  Am pent within a loathsome dungeon who  Shall shelter then thy unprotected virtue  No Edwin there to succour thee Who knows  What brutal lust and pow'r may dare to act  On a deserted beauteous friendless woman  Distracting thought A monarch's vengeance then  Wou'd come too late wou'd make me poor amends  For my Matilda's violated charms  MATILDA  He cannot be so mean so base of soul  Or if he shou'd I have a dagger here  To save me from dishonour  EDWIN  What by death  Dreadful alternative O hazard not  Thy precious life but seize the lucky moment  Which fortune gives us e'er it be too late  MATILDA  Urge me no more already I have felt  Too deeply felt the pangs of absence from thee  Another separation wou'd be worse  Than death and all its terrors No my love  We are embark'd on a tumultuous sea  And must abide the fury of the storm  The waves of angry fortune  may  o'erwhelm  But  shall not  part us We will stem the torrent  Brave the proud ocean's rage and gain the harbour  Of peace and happinessor  sink  together  EDWIN  Thou hast foretold the tempest and behold  It rushes on us  Enter MORCAR and HAROLD  MATILDA  Ha Earl Morcar here  MORCAR  Harold I thank thee thy intelligence  Was but too true  turning to Edwin  Traitor who set thee free  They wou'd have 'scap'd my vengeancefalse Matilda  'Tis thus I am rewarded for my love  My illtim'd mercy to a thankless brother  Back to thy dungeon slave Guards drag him hence  To prison and to death  to the soldiers  EDWIN  Or death or life  Are equal to me if I must be torn  From my Matilda But whate'er thy purpose  Be speedy in thy vengeance nor delay  The cruel work for know thy master comes  William approachesto revenge my cause  MORCAR  But not to save thee  EDWIN  Then farewel Matilda  Perhaps for everIf we meet no more  Thou wilt rememberBut I will not doubt  Thy honour or thy love I know thy truth  Know thou wilt act as best becomes thy fate  Whate'er it be and worthy of thyself  MATILDA  Of  thee  my Edwin rather say of  thee  Yes I will copy well thy bright example  I'll not disgrace thy love with woman's weakness  But part without a tear I will but stay  To tell thy tyrant brother how I hate  How I despise him and then follow thee  MORCAR  I'll hear no morebegoneaway with him  Exeunt guards with Edwin  For thee Matilda  MATILDA  What for me remains  I know too well thy odious love reproach  Unmerited and threats which I despise  Thou think'st I have deceiv'd theethink so still  Enjoy thy error Thou believ'st us guilty  'Twill make thee happy nowPerchance to find  Us innocent may be thy punishment hereafter  MORCAR  Aye 'twas a proof of innocence to fly  Thou and thy paramour together  MATILDA  No  I scorn a thought so mean Cou'd I have left  My Edwin long e'er this I might have been  Beyond the reach of tyranny beyond  Thy hated pow'r and safe beneath the wing  Of sacred majesty in William's care  MORCAR  In William's care  MATILDA  Thy conqueror'sfor know  The hero comesto scatter blessings round him  To heal his country's wounds chastise rebellion  And punish false perfidious slaves like thee  MORCAR  By heav'ns she braves my wrath insults my weakness  And triumphs o'er her slave  MATILDA  There was a time  When with an eye of pity I beheld  Thy hopeless love when I conceal'd my passion  For the dear idol of my heart because  I fear'd 'twou'd make thee wretched but thy rage  Thy cruel treatment of a guiltless brother  Has cancell'd all  MORCAR  Then mark me If thou hop'st  For Edwin's freedom shake off this vile passion  Yield thy proud heart to him who best deserves it  And meet me at the altarTwo hours hence  I shall expect thee thereBeyond that time  He may not live to thank thee for thy bounty  MATILDA  Then let him perishglut thy tyrant soul  With vengeance bathe it in a brother's blood  All ruffian all barbarian as thou art  Thou can'st not murder his immortal fame  Thou can'st not rob him of Matilda's love  But knowwhen he for whom alone this pulse  Wou'd wish to beat this lazy blood to flow  Within my veins when he shall be no more  Another life shall satiate thy revenge  Another victim shall attend thy triumph  MORCAR  Thou talk'st it nobly'tis the common trick  The affectation of thy sex to boast  A fancied firmness which ye never knew  But with affrighted nature thou wou'd'st shrink  When death approaches  MATILDA  Put me to the proof  If thou wou'd'st punish Edwin know he lives  Within this breaststrike home and pierce him there  MORCAR  Imperious woman thou defy'st my pow'r  And let it crush thee If thy country bleeds  In ev'ry vein if perjur'd Edwin falls  As soon he shall a victim to my rage  Thou art the murd'rer thou the paricide  I stand absolv'd the guilt is all thy own  MATILDA  If it be guilt to suffer keen reproach  Pain persecution terror chains and death  For him I love rather than stain my soul  With foul disloyalty I am indeed  The guiltiest of my sex and well deserve  The pangs I feel  MORCAR  Thou'st driv'n me to the pit  Of black despair and I will drag thee down  To share the dreadful ruin thou hast made  MATILDA  I know thy savage purpose but remember  The hour approaches when thou shalt repent  This base unmanly triumph William comes  Hear that and tremble thou unnat'ral brother  Nor rocks nor caves shall hide thee from his vengeance  Inglorious and unpitied shalt thou fall  And after ages shall consign thy name  To endless scorn and infamy immortal  Exit Matilda  MORCAR  Inexorable judge I stand condemn'd  And shall await my doom but not alone  Or unreveng'd shall Morcar fallhenceforth  I bid adieu to love and all his train  Of fond delusionsVengeance I am thine  And thine alone Thou daughter of despair  Destructive goddess come possess my soul  With all thy terrorsYes it shall be so  A few short hours are all that niggard fate  Will deign to spare me I'll employ 'em well  For I will croud into the narrow circle  A little age of misery and horror  Ha Siward here what brought thee hither  Enter SIWARD  SIWARD  Pity  For the distress'd I knew thou wert unhappy  And came where duty call'd to pour the balm  Of friendship in and heal thy wounded heart  MORCAR  O they have pierc'd too deep ev'n

we cast  The desp'rate dye of battle let me perish  By Morcar's side Come let us on together  Shake off this load of unavailing sorrow  And seek the field there if we fall we fall  With honor if we rise we rise toglory  MORCAR  Talk not of glory to a wretch like me  Bereft of ev'ry hope There was a time  When that enliv'ning call wou'd have awak'd  My active spirit and this drooping heart

writes me here that William's fame in arms  Spite of his cruel and oppressive laws  Hath rais'd him friends in ev'ry part already  The northern rebels are dispers'd and thousands  Flock to the royal standard To resist  Were madness  MORCAR  And to yield were cowardice  More shameful  SIWARD  What must we resolve on  MORCAR  Death  The wretches only hope the wish'dfor end  Of ev'ry care but I wou'd meet him cloath'd  In all his terrors with his reeking spear  Dipt in the blood of an ungrateful mistress  And a false happy rival Then my Siward  Shalt thou behold me welcome the kind stroke  And smile in agony  SIWARD  Unhappy youth  The storm beats hard upon thee but our fate  Will soon be fixt for William comes tomorrow  MORCAR  Tomorrow ha then something must be done  And quickly too

of endless woe  Hath thy blest hand preserv'd me  EDWIN  O my Matilda how shall we repay  Our noble benefactor Much I owe  To gallant Siward but to Morcar more  Tou gav'st me life but my kind gen'rous

wretched life and strive  To make my peace with heav'n and wrong'd Matilda  And if perchance in aftertimes some bard  Struck with the native horrors of my tale  Shou'd bid th' historic muse record itlet him  By  my  example teach a future age  The dire effects of loose unbridled rage  Teach thoughtless men their passions to controul  And curb the sallies of th'impetuous soul  Lest they
