 EDWIN AND ELTRUDA  A LEGENDARY TALE  PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  EDWIN AND ELTRUDA  A LEGENDARY TALE  BY A YOUNG LADY  Mark it Cesario it is true and plain  The spinsters and the knitters in the sun  And the free maids that weave their thread with bones  Do use to chant it It is silly sooth  And dallies with the innocence of love  Like the old age  SHAKSPEARE'S TWELFTH NIGHT  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXII  ADVERTISEMENT By the EDITOR  THE young Lady who is the writer of the following Poem is a native of London but was removed with her Family in very early life to a remote part of the kingdom where her sole instruction was derived from a virtuous amiable and sensible mother In so distant a situation she had such little access to books that when the piece now presented to the public was written she had not read Mr Cartwright's Armine and  Elvira Dr Percy's Hermit of Warkworth and other beautiful productions of that kind On her return to the metropolis last summer the Poem being shewn to several of her acquaintance they earnestly requested its publication to which she hath consented with the modesty and diffidence that in the season of youth are the usual concomitants of true virtue Having long been intimate with the family I with pleasure undertook the task of Editor and my pleasure will be greatly increased if this performance shall meet with a favourable reception from the judges of poetical merit Should there be found in it many marks of an elegant and pathetic genius to these not only the candid but even the judicious critic will direct his principal attention and will be disposed to forgive the simplicity of the story and that  diffusion of sentiment which is so natural to a youthful mind in its first essays in composition  FEB  AND

level'd with the ground  Once many a sculptur'd trophy grac'd  And banners wav'd around  There  liv'd a Chief to fame well known  A warlike virtuous knight  Who many a wellfought field had won  By valour and by might  What time in martial pomp he led  His chosen gallant train  The foe that erst had conquer'd fled  Indignant fled the plain  Yet milder virtues he possest  More gentle passions felt  And in his calm and yielding breast  Each soft affection dwelt  Not all the rugged toils of war  His bosom e'er could steel  He felt for every child of care  His heart was apt to feel  And much that heart was doom'd to bear  And many a grief to prove  To feel the fulness of despair  The woes of hopeless love  To lose the partner of his breast  Who sooth'd each rising care  And with mild efforts charm'd to rest  The griefs she sought to share  He mark'd the chilling damps of death  O'erspread her fading charms  He saw her yield her quiv'ring breath  And sink in death's cold arms  From solitude he hop'd relief  And this lone mansion sought  To cherish there his sacred grief  And nurse the tender thought  Here object of his fondest cares  An infant daughter smil'd  And oft the mourner's falling tears  Bedew'd his EMMA's child  These tears as o'er the babe he hung  Would tremble in his eye  While blessings fault'ring on his tongue  Were breath'd but in a sigh  For many a sad revolving year  His hopeless griefs endure  For ah a sorrow so severe  'Tis death alone can cure  Yet time can soften the deep wound  It has not power to heal  And in this child he thought he found  His muchlov'd EMMA still  In his ELTRUDA's gentle breast  His griefs he could repose  With each endearing virtue blest  She soften'd all his woes  Twas easy in her look to trace  An emblem of her mind  There  dwelt each mild attractive grace  Each gentle grace combin'd  Soft as the dews of morn arise  And on the pale flower gleam  So soft so sweet her melting eyes  With love and pity beam  As far retir'd the lonely flower  Smiles in the desart vale  And blows its balmy sweets to pour  Upon the flying gale  So liv'd in solitude unseen  This lovely peerless maid  So sweetly grac'd the vernal scene  And blossom'd in the shade  Yet love could pierce the lone recess  For there he loves to dwell  He scorns the noisy croud to bless  And seeks the lowly cell  There only his resistless dart  In all its power is known  His empire sways each willing heart  They live to love alone  EDWIN of every grace possest  First taught her heart to prove  That gentlest passion of the breast  To seel the power of love  Tho' few the pastures he possest  Tho' scanty was his store  Tho' wealth ne'er swell'd his hoarded chest  EDWIN could boast of more  EDWIN could boast the liberal mind  The gen'rous ample heart  And every virtue heav'n inclin'd  To bounty can impart  The maxims of this servile age  The mean the selfish care  The sordid views that now engage  The mercenary pair  Whom riches can unite or part  To them was all unknown  For then the sympathetic heart  Was link'd by love alone  They little knew that wealth had power  To make the constant rove  They little knew the splendid dower  Could add a bliss to love  They little knew the human breast  Could pant for sordid ore  Or of a faithful heart possest  Could ever wish for more  And tho' her peerless beauty warms  His heart to love inclin'd  Not less he felt the lasting charms  The beauties of her mind  Not less his gentle soul approv'd  The virtues glowing there  For surely Virtue to be lov'd  Needs only to appear  The sweets of dear domestic bliss  Each circling hour beguil'd  And meekey'd hope and inward peace  On the lone mansion smil'd  Oft o'er the daisysprinkled mead  They wander'd far away  Some lambkin to the fold to lead  That haply chanc'd to stray  Her heart where pity lov'd to dwell  With sadness oft was wrung  For the bruis'd insect as it fell  Her soft tear trembling hung  As roving o'er the flow'ry waste  A sigh would heave her breast  The while her gentle hand replac'd  The linnet's falling nest  Then would she seek the vernal bow'r  And haste with tender care  To nurse some pale declining flow'r  Some op'ning blossom rear  And oft with eager steps she flies  To chear the lonely cot  Where the poor widow pour her sighs  And wails her hapless lot  Their weeping mother's trembling knees  Her lisping infants clasp  Their meek imploring look she fees  She feels their tender grasp  Wild throbs her aching bosom swell  They mark the bursting sigh  Nature has form'd the soul to feel  They weep unknowing why  HER hands the lib'ral boon impart  And much her tear avails  To sooth the mourner's bursting heart  Where feeble utterance fails  On the pale cheek where hung the tear  Of agonizing woe  She bids the gush of joy rise there  The tear of rapture flow  If greater plenty to impart  She e'er would heav'n implore  'Twas only that her ample heart  Still panted to do more  Thus soft the gliding moments flew  Tho' love would court their stay  While some new virtue rose to view  And mark'd each fleeting day  Peace long condemn'd the world to roam  Like the poor wand'ring dove  Here softlyresting found a home  And wish'd no more to rove  The youthful poet's soothing dream  Of youthful ages past  The Muses' fond ideal theme  Was realiz'd at last  Joy springs amid' encircling cares  To breasts where virtue glows  For Virtue in this vale of tears  A paradise bestows  But vainly here we hope that bliss  Unchanging will endure  Ah in a world so vain as this  What heart can rest secure  For now arose the deathfraught day  For civil discord fam'd  When YORK from LANCASTER's proud sway  The Royal sceptre claim'd  The passing moments now were fraught  With desolating rage  And now the bloody deeds were wrought  That swell th' historic page  The good old ALBERT vows again  To seek the hostile field  The cause of HENRY to maintain  The spear for him to wield  But oh a thousand sacred ties  That bind the hero's soul  A thousand tender claims arise  And EDWIN's breast controul  And link the youth to HENRY's foes  But ah it rends his heart  The aged ALBERT to oppose  To bear an adverse part  Tho' passion pleads in HENRY's cause  And EDWIN's heart would sway  Yet honour's stern imperious laws  The brave will still obey  Oppress'd with many a mingled care  Full oft ELTRUDA sigh'd  And mourn'd the rugged brow of war  Should those she lov'd divide  At length the fatal morn arose  In gloomy vapours drest  The pensive maiden's sorrow flows  And pale fear heav'd her breast  A thousand pangs the father feels  A thousand tender fears  While at his feet she trembling kneels  And bathes them with her tears  A falling drop bedew'd his cheek  From the sad scene he flew  The tender father could not speak  He could not sayadieu  Then EDWIN hapless EDWIN came  He saw her pallid look  And tremblings seize her tender frame  While thus he fault'ring spoke  " This cruel tenderness but wounds  " The heart it means to bless  " Those falling tears those plaintive sounds  " Increase the soft distress  " Then be to wretched EDWIN kind  " Nor mourn dear tender maid"  At length on EDWIN's breast reclin'd  ELTRUDA faintly said  " If fate relentless has decreed  " On yonder hostile plain  " My EDWIN's destin'd heart to bleed  " And swell the heaps of slain  " Trust me my love I'll not complain  " I'll shed no feeble tear  " Not one weak drop my cheek shall stain  " Or tell what passes here  " Ah let thy fate of others claim  " A tear a tender sigh  " I'll only murmur thy dear name  " Call on my loveand die"  'Twere vain for feeble words to tell  The pangs their bosoms prov'd  They only can conceive it well  Whose hearts have trembling lov'd  The timid Muse forbears to say  What laurels EDWIN won  Nor paints the gallant deeds that day  By aged ALBERT done  On softer themes alone she dwells  As trembling thro' the grove  Of friendship's woes she sad'ning tells  Or sings of hapless love  Tho' long the beaming day was fled  The fight they still maintain  While night a deeper horror shed  O'er the ensanguin'd plain  The martial trump invades the ear  And drowns the orphan's cry  No more the widow's shriek they hear  The lovelorn virgin's sigh  The pangs those dearbought laurels yield  Alas what tongue can speak  Perchance not one that strews the field  But leaves some heart to break  To ALBERT's breast the faulshion flew  He felt a mortal wound  The drops that warm'd his heart bedew  And stain the flinty ground  The Foe who aim'd the deadly dart  Heard his expiring sighs  Soft pity touch'd his yielding heart  To ALBERT streight he flies  While round the Chief his arms he cast  While oft his bosom sigh'd  And seem'd as if it mourn'd the past  Old ALBERT faintly cry'd  " Tho' nature heaves these feeble groans  " Without complaint I die  " Yet one dear care my heart still owns  " Still feels one tender tie  " For YORK a youth well known to fame  " Uplifts the hostile spear  " EDWIN's the blooming heroe's name  " To ALBERT's bosom dear  " Ah tell him my expiring sigh  " Say my last words besought  " To my despairing child to fly  " 'Ere fame the tidings brought"  He spokebut oh what mournful strain  In sadness apt to melt  What moving numbers can explain  The pangs that EDWIN felt  For EDWIN 'twas himself that held  The dying warrior prest  Whom the dark shades of night conceal'd  Close to his throbbing breast  " Ah fly he cry'd my touch profane  " Oh how the rest impart  " 'Twas EDWIN plung'drever'd old man  " The dagger in thy heart"  His dying eyes he feebly rais'd  Which seem'd for ever clos'd  On the pale youth they piteous gaz'd  And then in death repos'd  " I'll go the hapless EDWIN said  " And breathe a last adieu  " And with the drops despair will shed  " My mourning love bedew  " I'll go the tender maid to seek  " To catch her bursting sigh  " To wipe the tear from her pale cheek  " And at her feet to die"  And as the tender maid to seek  The frantic mourner flew  To wipe the tear from her pale cheek  And breathe a last adieu  Appall'd his startling fancy sees  His true love's sorrows flow  And hears in every passing breeze  The plaintive sounds of woe  Mean while the weeping maid whose prayers  In vain would heav'n implore  Of ALBERT's fate despairing hears  But yet had heard do more  She saw her muchlov'd EDWIN near  She saw and piteous sigh'd  The sight chill'd every falling tear  At length she faintly cry'd  " Eternal woes this heart must prove  " Its tenderest ties are broke  " Ah say what ruthless arm my love  " Could aim the deadly stroke  " Could not thy hand my EDWIN thine  " Have warded off the blow  " For ah he was not only mine  " He was  thy  father too  No longer EDWIN could endure  The pangs no strains can tell  From death he fondly hop'd a cure  As senseless cold he fell  She flewshe gave her sorrows vent  A thousand tears she pour'd  Her mournful voice her moving plaint  The youth to life restor'd  " Why wildly throbs each shiv'ring vein  " She cry'd my EDWIN speak  " Or all unable to sustain  " These pangs my heart will break"  " Yesit will break he frantic cry'd  " For me will life resign  " Then trembling know thy father died  " And know the guilt was mine"  " It is enough"with short quick breath  Exclaim'd the mournful maid  She spoke no more but seem'd from death  To hope for instant aid  But lo a pensive silent train  With downcast looks appear  Who ALBERT'S pallid corse sustain  Plac'd on a sable bier  For hapless EDWIN fondly thought  It might some comfort yield  If good old ALBERT'S corse were brought  From off the bloodstain'd field  He thought 'twould sooth ELTRUDA'S pains  O'er the dear hallow'd urn  Which ALBERT'S sacred dust contains  A while her griefs to mourn  But ah all frantic at the sight  A hurried glance she threw  Then starting wild with pale affright  That hurried glance withdrew  Trembling she rush'd and in her arms  The dear remains she prest  But sudden paleness veil'd her charms  So late in beauty drest  In plaintive accents EDWIN cries  " And have I murder'd thee  " To other worlds thy spirit flies  " And mine this stroke shall free"  His hand the deathfraught weapon grasp'd  The steel he firmly prest  When sudden she arose and clasp'd  Him wildly to her breast  " Methought she cry'd with panting breath  " My EDWIN talk'd of peace  " I knew 'twas only found in death  " And fear'd that sad release  " To clasp him still'twas but a dream  " Help yon wide wound to close  " From which a father's spirits stream  " A father's lifeblood flows  " But see from thee he shrinks nor would  " Be blasted by thy touch  " Ah tho' my EDWIN spilt thy blood  " Yet once he lov'd thee much  " My father yet in pity stay  " I see his white beard wave  " A spirit beckons him away  " And points to yon cold grave  " E'en now my love I trembling hear  " Him breath a last adieu  " I see my love the falling tear  " His furrow'd cheek bedew  " I feel within his aged arms  " His poor ELTRUDA prest  " I hear him speak the fond alarms  " That wring a parent's breast  " He's goneand here his ashes sleep  " I do not heave a sigh  " His child a father does not weep  " For ah my brain is dry  " But come together let us rove  " At the pale hour of night  " When the moon glimm'ring thro' the grov  " Shall shed her faintest light  " We'll gather from the rosy bow'r  " The fairest wreaths that bloom  " We'll cull my love each op'ning flow'  " To deck his hallow'd tomb  " We'll thither from the distant dale  " A weeping willow bear  " And plant a lily of the vale  " A drooping lily there  " We'll shun the glaring face of day  " Eternal silence keep  " Thro' the dark wood we'll chearless stray  " And only live to weep  " But hark'tis comethe fatal time  " When EDWIN we must part  " Some angel tells me 'tis a crime  " To hold thee to my heart  " My father's spirit hovers near  " Alas he comes to chide  " Is there no means my EDWIN dear  " The fatal deed to hide  " None nonefor wheresoe'er we go  " Lo streams of blood proceed  " And should the torrent cease to flow  " Yet still our hearts would bleed  " Our hearts the secret would betray  " The tale of death reveal  " Angels would come in dread array  " The bloody deed to tell  " Yet EDWIN if th' offence be thine  " Too soon I can forgive  " But oh the guilt would all be mine  " Could I endure to live  " Farewell my lovefor ah I faint  " Of pale despair I die  " And see that hoary murder'd saint  " Descends from yon blue sky  " Poor weak old manhe comes my love  " To lead to heav'n the way  " He knows not heaven will joyless prove  " While EDWIN is away"  " It is too much" he frantic cry'd  Then to his bosom prest  The dying maid who piteous sigh'd  And sunk to endless rest  He saw her dying eyelids close  He heard her latest sigh  And yet no tear of anguish flows  Fast streaming from his eye  For ah the fulness of despair  The pang of highwrought woe  Admits no silent trembling tear  No lenient drop to flow  He feels within his shivering veins  A mortal chillness rise  Her pallid corse he feebly strains  And on her bosom dies  No longer may their hapless lot  The mournful Muse engage  She wipes away the tears that blot  The melancholy page  For heav'n in love dissolves the ties  That chain the spirit here  And distant far for ever flies  The blessing held most dear  To bid the suff'rer's soul aspire  A higher bliss to prove  To wake the pure refin'd desire  The hope that rests above  FINIS
