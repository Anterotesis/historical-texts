HISTORY OF  St PAUL'S  VOL II  CHAP I  Paul preaching at Athens  WHilst Paul was at Athens he saw  PAUL at ATHENS  the city wholly given to idolatry for which reason he not only preached in the synagogue to the Jews and proselytes but in other places of concourse he took occasion to make known the Christian doctrine to all the heathens he met  Some learned men of Athens seeing Paul so ready to engage in dispute with every one undertook  him but not understanding him some cried he was a prating babbling fellow others that he came to discover some strange God to them because he frequently mentioned Jesus and the resurrection  After this they brought him before the magistrates to be examined what new religion it was he taught for all that they had hitherto  heard was new and strange and therefore they desired to have a full account of all Paul being at full liberty to speak said 'I perceive O Athenians that ye have a great number of idols for as I passed by and saw your superstitious devotions I found an altar with this inscription TO THE UNKNOWN GOD This GOD therefore  whom you acknowledge not to know yet profess to worship is he whom I preach the invisible God of heaven and earth who cannot be contained in temples of man's making nor can any image made by man be a proper object of his worship he being so far from wanting our help that it is he that gives to all their life and all that they have And from one  man he hath made a whole world of men appointing times and places in great order And the end of all this is that they should seek after their Creator and worship him who is indeed near every one of us even as the Soul that animates us  For our life motion and subsistance are wholly thro' him according to that which one of your own poets hath said  God therefore being our Creator we cannot in reason suppose him to be the work of our hands such as a piece of gold silver or a stone graved This time of ignorance hath lasted long but now God calls you are to repentance having determined the way by which all the world shall be judged that is by receiving or refusing the faith of Christ who  being rais'd from the dead is offered to all men to believe in'  When they heard him mention the resurrection the Epicureans especially who denied a future state fell a laughing at him others said we will hear thee about this another time and so Paul left them  This is the representation of the fifth piece of painting in the cupola  CONJURING Books burnt  CHAP II  The conjuring books burnt  SOme of the vagabond Jewish exorcists seeing the many extraordinary miracles which were wrought by the hand of Paul insomuch that he did not only cure them who came to him but by his touching linen clothes and sending them to such  as were sick or possessed with devils they were immediately healed The exorcists I say seeing this they also attempted to cast out devils by using the name of JESUS among whom were the seven sons of one Scaeva a Jew one of the chief of the families of the priests who adjuring the evil spirit in the name of Jesus were thus answered by the possessed  '  Jesus I know and Paul I know  but you come not with any authority from Jesus who hath given it to Paul'  And the man who was possessed fell furiously upon them and was too hard for them tearing off their clothes and wounding them so that they were glad to sly from him  This being soon rumoured among the Jews and  natives of Ephesus prevailed so with them that they were convinced and converted to the faith  And they that were so happy came to Paul and his company confessing their former course of life to know what they should do And many that had studied and practised magick brought their books out and burnt them publickly tho' they were of  a very high price Of so great authority was the word of God as it was preached by Paul among the Ephesians and those of Asia  This latter part of the burning of the books is the subject of the sixth piece of painting  King AGRIPPA  CHAP III  King Agrippa almost persuaded to be a Christian  PAUL having been brought before king Agrippa to answer to divers complaints made against him by the Jews in general as a most notorious malefactor and after Festus a noble orator had open'd his case in an elegant  speech before the court Agrippa told Paul he had liberty to speak who desiring silence of the audience began with this apology for himself  'I cannot but think my self happy O king Agrippa in that I am permitted to make my defence against the accusation laid by the Jews before your Majesty whom I know to be a perfect master of the  Jewish laws and customs for which reason I beg your patience  He then acquaints the king with the manner of his life from his youth of his being bred a Pharisee of his being accused for asserting the resurrection of the dead appeals to him why it should be thought a thing incredible that God who is omnipotent should raise  the dead Confesses his own former unbelief the havock that he made amongst the church his extraordinary conversion and many other things relating both to himself and to the gospel of Jesus Christ And at last asked king Agrippa this question '  Believest thou the prophets O king  I am satisfied thou dost and knowest their predictions to be fulfilled  This was so home a challenge to Agrippa that in the publick presence he declared that Paul had almost persuaded him to be a Christian  Upon this the assembly broke up And when Agrippa and Feslus had consulted together about Paul's case they freely owned that the accusation laid against him was not punishable by death or imprisonment  This history is the subject of the seventh piece of painting  CHAP IV  Paul's voyage and shipwreck on the island of Milita or Malta  PAUL having appealed unto Caesar and an opportunity offering Festus sends him to Rome  St Paul's Shipwreck  under a guard commanded by one Julius in a ship belonging to a sea port of Mysia in which they set sail and coasted along Asia till they arrived at Sidon where Julius who treated Paul very respectfully gave him leave to go ashore and resresh himself  Sailing from thence they came in fight of the sland of Cyprus where they were to lie by a  while but the winds presenting they passed the seas of Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Mira a maritime city of Lycia Here Julius finding a large ship bound for Italy took his prisoners on board her and with much ado made Salome a city of Crete from whence after they had been long beating at sea with contrary winds and very stormy weather  they arrived at Fairhavens near Lasca where Paul would have persuaded captain Julius to wait for more seasonable weather but he preferring the master of the ship's judgment they put to sea intending to reach Phoenice a harbour of Creto where there was safe riding and there to winter and they having a light gale of south they questioned  not in the least of gaining their point  But they soon found themselves mistaken for the wind suddenly tacking about blew so very hard at north east that they were forced to hand all their sails and let her drive before the wind And coming under a little island called Clauda they had like to have lost their boat but with much ado  recovering it they hoisted it into the ship  The next day the storm continuing they were forced to cut away their masts and throw all their tackle overboard and lighten their ship The storm still increasing and neither sun nor stars for many days appearing they gave themselves over for lost  Which Paul perceiving he told them that he had  seen a vision which assured him that not a soul of them should be lost tho' the ship should  The ship thus driving for fourteen days at the mercy of the winds and waves about midnight the sailors fansied they were near land and throwing the lead they sounded and found it twenty fathoms then fifteen and it still shaling and being  night they apprehended they might strike upon some shelves in the dark so they let go four anchors astern and waited for day  And now the seamen resolving to shift for themselves had hoisted the boat overboard under pretence of mooring the ship ahead as they had done astern but Paul perceiving their design told captain Julius that if the sailors were suffered  to quit the ship they should be in danger of being all lost Upon this the soldiers to prevent their design cut the ropes and let the boat go adrift  Now Paul persuades them on board to take some refreshment The number of all that were in the ship was two hundred seventy six including soldiers and passengers  In the space between  that and daybreak they all eat and drank and were refreshed having had no leisure or thought of eating for a considerable time before After this refreshment they sell chearfully to work unloading the ship not only of goods but of the provisions and throwing them into the sea  When it was day they discovered a creak and a  haven into which they endeavoured to put and when they had weighed the anchors they made to the shore and run the ship aground where she soon bulg'd The captain then ordered the prisoners that could swim to throw themselves into the sea first and the rest on broken pieces got safe to land where when they were all arrived they knew the  place to be the island Melita or Malta  The islanders seeing them in distress treated them with great humanity making fires to warm their wet and weary limbs But whilst they were drying and warming themselves a viper driven from her hole by the heat of the fire leaped out and fastened upon Paul's hand which when the natives  saw they concluded him guilty of murder and that divine vengeance had pursued him to that place to die by the bite of this venomous creature but he shook it off into the fire and felt no harm On seeing this they presently alter'd their opinion and concluded him a God  The latter part of this history is the subject of the eighth and last piece of painting  CHAP V  Of the Library the Model of St Peter's at Rome the great Bell and geometrical Staircase  HAving quitted the whispering gallery you are next invited to see the above curiosities for which favour  each persen pays Twopence  The Library room is  large and beautiful the wainscoting carvings shelves  c  are of nice workmanship but notwithstanding there is a large collection of books in it the shelves appear very thin and those lock'd up in a profound silence some lolling fast asleep one way and some another  These books were designed for the use of the clergy belonging to the  cathedral but what from the height of its situation which is half way up the cupola and the dulness of its company consisting mosily of a parcel of antiquated must crabbed old authors makes it very seldom visited by them Their chief use now is to be made a publick shew of like so many monsters to strangers country people and little masters and  misses who whenever they come to see this fine Library must always take care to go into the room on tiptoe for fear of disturbing any of these drousy old gentlemen  The floor of this room is very curious being imlaid without peg or nail with so much art and ingenuity that it really looks very beautiful  There is also a fine picture  in it of the right reverend Henry Compton late lord bishop of London  The Model of St Peter's at Rome  This was taken by Sir Christopher Wren from the church of St Peter at Rome whilst he resided there and from this with some alterations our cathedral of St Paul was built  he having took care to correct in the latter what he saw a blemish in the former This model stands in a large room where those who are curious may examine it 'Tis a fine piece though now fallen somewhat to decay  As to the great Bell and Clock I have spoke of them before in the first Volume pag to which  I must refer my young readers and shall only add that the way to them is both dark and somewhat difficult to ascend and therefore not advisable for my young readers to venture up without a proper guide Besides should the clock happen to strike whilst they are in the bell lost the sound is so surprisingly loud and shocking to those who are unaccustomed  to it that they would imagine it would rend the very tower all to pieces  There is one thing more which is observable that this clock is wound up once a day which generally takes up an hour's time and as 'tis then set it is looked upon to be very exact  Lastly You are shewn the grand Geometrical  Staircase which is a curious and wonderful piece of workmanship and so artfully contrived that the support of the whole principally depends on the footstone only This and the stone staircase at Hampton court are the only two of the kind that are to be met with in any of our publick buildings  To give a more particular account of its beauties  would require the judgment of one who is conversant in the science to which I must ingenuously acknowledge my self a stranger  Next we shall proceed to the inside of the church  BOOK II  CHAP I  Of the inside of St Paul's  THE pillars of the church that support the roof are two ranges with their entablature and beautiful arches whereby the body of the church and choir are divided into  three isles The roof of each is adorn'd with arches and spacious peripheries of enrichments as shields leaves chaplets  c  admirably carved in stone  At the west end of the church there are three doors which lead to the above isles from each of which you have a beautiful prospect the whole length of the church  without any interception from the pillars  c  Just within the door of the north isle on the left hand is the morning prayer chapel where divine service is performed every day in the week excepting Sundays from Ladyday to Michaelmas at six in the morning and from Michaelmas to Layday at seven In the north tower is the bell for calling people to prayers  The front of this chapel has a very beautiful skreen of curious wainscot and adorn'd with twelve columns their entablatures arched pediments and the royal arms enriched with cherubims and each pediment between four vases all curiously carved and the skreen is senced with ironwork  Next to the morning  prayer chapel is the Lord Mayor's vestry to which he generally repairs with his attendants before he takes his seat in the choir and then divine service immediately begins  At the entrance of the south isle on the right hand is the door that leads to the geometrical staircase Next to that is the bishop of London's spiritual court which has  a beautiful skreen of curious wainscot with columns carvings and other enrichments like those of the morning prayer chapel A little beyond this court on the left hand is a beautiful marble font which for largeness the fineness of its marble and curious workmanship excels all others for which reason I thought the picture of it would not be  The MARBLE FONT  unacceptable to my young readers You go up two circular sleps to it  Farther on the right hand is the door which leads up to the cupola  CHAP III  Of the fine organcase  c  THE organcase is magnificent finely ornamented and enrich'd with the carved figures of several cupids and eight fames with their trumpets standing on the top of the case four looking eastward and four westward each appearing near six feet high  It is also enriched with cherubims fruit leaves  c  represented in a very lively manner The organ pipes are very spacious gilt with gold and preserved from dust with fine sashes all which are raised on cight beautiful flured columns of the Corinthian order of polished marble white vein'd with blue  CHAP III  of the altarpiece  c  THE altarpiece is adorned with four noble fluted pilasters finely painted and veined with gold in imitation of lapis lazuli with their entableture where the enrichments and also the capitals of the pilasters are double gilt with gold the intercolumns  columns are twenty one pannels of figured crimson velvet above all is a glory finely done  The openings north and south into the choir are ascending up three steps of black marble by two iron folding doors liek those under the organ gallery and facing the choir exquisitely wrought into divers figures spiral branches and other flourishes  and there are two others of these fine iron doors the one opening into the south isle the other into the north they were all done by that celebrated artist in his way Monsieur Tijan  CHAP IV  Of the choir the officers of the church their seats  c  THis cathedral hath a Bishop a Dean a Precentor Chancellor Treasurer and five Archdeacons to wit London Middlesex Essex colchester and St Albans It hath thirty Prebendaries  twelve Canons and six Vicars choral  The north and south sides of the choir have each thity stalls besides the Bishop's throne and seat on the south side and the Lord Mayor's on the north all which compose one vast body of curious carved work of the finest wainscot done by that excellent artist the late Mr Gribeline Gibbon as was  likewise all the other carved work both of the ehoir and church  On the south side of the entrance into the choir is the dean's vestry and near that the singing boys vestry and on the noth side the residentiarys and singing mens vestry where they all robe and unrobe  There are four Vergers belonging to this church so called from  virga  a rod  which each bears in his hand The dean's has the cross daggers at top the others have no ensign at all  The floor of the choir and church is pav'd with marble but within the rail of the altar with fine porphyry polish'd and laid in sveral geometrical figures the arabathrum whereon the communion table is placed is sive steps  higher than that of the choirs isles  We shall next descend into the vaults under St Paul's  CHAP V  Of the vaults tombs and St Faith's church under St Paul's  THE passage down to these vaults is by a door in the body of the church  These vaults are indeed very spacious but at the same time dark and gloomy and strike a kind of horror in those who descend in order to survey the numerous and massy pillars and arches which support this prodigious pile of buildings of which they may be able to form some idea from the glimmering light that is introduced into it from the  small windows that open into the churchyard  However this place is too solemn melancholy and unpleasant for our young readers to roam about in neither indeed are they invited to see it as they are the other curiosities belonging to the church and therefore would advise them to be contented with this account of it rather than  ST FAITH'S CHURCH  to gratify their curiosity by taking so gloomy a prospect  Under the choir there was formerly the parish church of St Faith commonly called  St Faith's under St Paul's  of which there is now no remains There is indeed a spot of ground railed in and set apart for the burial of the dead of that parish which is still subsisting and united  to that of St Austin'sSo that the notion which is entertain'd by several persons and by others confidently asserted that there is a parish church now beneath the choir and that there are prayers and preaching still performed therein on some particular days is vulgar error and altogether groundless  There are under the choir in this dark repository  the monuments of several eminent persons but as it would be too tedious to give a description of them all and no ways entertaining to the young reader we shall pass them over in silence and take notice only of that of the Architect of this grand building who lies interr'd in a little corner close to the foundation wall on the southeast side next Watlingstreet  There is a plain stone fix'd against the wall at his head with the following inscription in capitals  SUBTUS CONDITOR HUIUS ECCLESIAE ET VRBIS CONDITOR CRISTOPHORUS WREN QUI VINIT ANNOS ULTRA N  NAGINTA NON S  SED BONO PUBLICO  LECTOR SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS CIRCUMSPICE OBIIT XXV FEB ANNO MDCCXXIII ET XCI  The purpot of which is this  Here lies the body of Christopher Wren the Architect of this cathedral church c who lived above ninety years and studied the good of the publick and not his own private  interest and advantage Reader If thou art curious to know where his monument is cast thy eyes all around thee He died Feb    aged    This inscription is much admired for the justness and simplicity of the thought  Over his body is a plain stone with the following inscription  HERE LIETH CHRISTOPHER WREN KNIGHT THE BUILDER OF THIS CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF ST PAUL c WHO DIED IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD MDCCXXIII AND OF HIS AGE XCI  The End of the History of St Paul's  The MONUMENT  AN ACCOUNT Of the MONUMENT  Of the Fire of London  CHAP I  Its situation description and building  ON the east side of Fishstreethill near to the foot of Londonbridge  stands the Monument in a square open to the street  It was set up by order of parliament in perpetual memory of the dreadful fire that hapned the second day of  September  within one hundred and thirty feet of the house where the fire first broke out and upon the spot where the church of St Margernet's Newfishstreet stood  This Monument stands upon an ascent from the street of three or four steps upon a large vault of stone arched  The column is of the Dorick order built all of excellent Portland stone 'Tis erected upon a pedestal or square of about twenty seven feet high The body or shaft of it is fluted and is in height from the pedestal to the  balcony a hundred and thirty three feet and from the balcony to the top of the flame is thirty eight feet And the height of the whole Monument from the ground besides the vault and foundation to the top of the flame is two hundred and two feet the circumference of the shaft forty seven feet and a half its diameter from without the  wall fifteen feet withinside nine feet diameter the thickness of the stone wall of the shaft is three feet  It hath three hundred and forty five steps or stairs from the ground up to the balcony and niches in the wall with seats to rest in as people go up and from the balcony upwards is a ladder of iron steps to go into the urn  out of which the flame all gilt with godl issueth and to the stairs having an open newel there is a rail of iron to rest the hand upon all the way up  This Monument is not unlike those two antient white marble pillars at Rome erected in honour of the emperors Trajan and Antoninus which were built above fifteen hundred years since and  are still standing entire  The whole of this Monument taken together is a curious piece of workmanship The charge of erecting it is said to amount to thirteen thousand seven hundred pounds and upwards  This building loftily shews itself above the houses and gives a gallant prospect for many miles round to those that are  in the balcony so that many people have the curiosity to go up and look about them from thence The person appointed to keep it is allowed a salary for his attendance besides the money people give him The price demanded is  Twopence each person  It was begun in the may oralty of Sir Richard Ford and finish'd in that of Sir Joseph Sheldon  Top of the Monument  Bottom of the Monument  CHAP II  Of the careted figures in he west front  THE side towards the street hath a representation of the destruction of the city by the fire and the rebuilding of it again by several curiously engraven figures made in full proportion  First is the figure of a  woman representing London sitting on ruins in a most disconsolate posture her head hanging down and her hair all loose about her the sword lying by her and her left hand carelesly laid upon it A second figure is Time with his wings and bald head coming behind her and gently lifting her up Another female figure on the side of her laying  her hand upon her and with a scepter winged in her other hand directing her to look upwards for it points up to two beautiful goddesses sitting in the clouds one leaning on a cornucopia denoting Plenty the other having a palmbranch in her hand signifying Victory or Triumph Underneath this figure of London in the midst of the ruins is  a dragon with his paw upon the shield of a red cross the arms of London Over her head are represented houses burning and flames breaking out thro' the windows behind her citizens looking on and some of them lifting up their hands  Opposite to these figures is a pavement of stone rais'd with three or four steps on which appears  king Charles the second in a Roman habit with a truncheon in his right hand and a laurel about his head coming towards the woman in the despairing posture aforesaid and giving orders to two or three others to descend the steps towards her The firit hath wings on her head and a crown of naked boys dancing and in her hand something resembling  an harp Then another figure of one going down the steps following her representing Architect shewing a scheme or model for rebuilding the city held in the right hand and the lest holding a square and compasses Behind these two stands another figure holding up an hat denoting Liberty Next behind the king is the duke  of York holding a garland ready to crown the rising city and a sword lifted up in the other hand to desend her Behind this a third figure with and earl's coronet on his head A fourth behind all holding a lion with a bridle in his mouth Over these figures is represented an house in building and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his  back Lastly underneath the stone pavement whereon the king stands is a good figure of envy peeping forth gnawing an heart  An Explanation of some of the  hard Words  made use of in the two
