him and  Osmyn  Grand Visier of the  Turks  is taken Prisoner Upon the Arrival of this unhappy News  Amelia Casimir's  Wife resolves to try all possible Means to effect his Redemption accordingly she advises  Rodulpho  a young Prince and an intimate Friend of  Casimir  to dress himself in a  Turkish  Habit and present her to  Osmyn  as a Captive taken by him imagining that if she could be brought into the Presence of the Grand Visier he would be so deeply captivated with her Beauty that she could easily induce him to grant any Favour upon a seeming Condescension to any thing he should ask of her in return With this View she is carried to  Osmyn  upon whom she had the Influence  she promis'd herself and compleated the Redemption of her Husband  Amelia  having thus successfully obtained her desired Ends soon after meeting with a good Opportunity when  Osmyn  was engaged in other Affairs makes her Escape with  Rodulpho  by Night and disappoints the Grand Visier of his Expectation  Augusta Casimir  's Sister all this while missing  Amelia  and  Rodulpho  her Lover supposes they are gone upon some vicious Design and  Casimir  himself not finding them at home at his Return concurs with her in the same Opinion so that upon her coming back they meet with a Reception much contrary to what they might naturally hope for after so dangerous an Adventure being both instantly put into Confinement  Amelia  so highly resents this undeserved Usage that she advises  Rodulpho  not to give  Casimir  any immediate Satisfaction about their Undertakings but  Rodulpho  finding that such a Delay would be of dangerous Consequence a Day being already fix'd for their Execution resolves to conceal it  no longer but in a Letter to  Casimir  gives a genuine Account of all their Proceedings the Truth of which he is so well convinced of that he is instantly reconciled to both his Deliverers and gives  Augusta  to  Rodulpho  in Marriage as a Gratuity for his extraordinary Friendship

Princess of your Brother's Safety  Am not I almost equally concern'd  To  Casimir  my Friendship is so great  That but for your dear Sake  Arm'd by his Side with Pleasure would I march  To shield him and to share with him the Danger  Aug  Are you already weary of your Charge  Go follow him it is not yet too late  I need not your Protection  Leave me leave me  Don't deceive me  Faithless Lover  I discover  That another has your Heart  All your Smiling  Is beguiling  All your Passion  Affectation  Go I see through all your Art  Rod  You wrong me fair  Augusta  Can you condemn my real Friendship  To him whom you so dearly value  You are the only one of all the Sex  That ever gain'd my Heart  Why would you then torment me thus  And wound me with such undeserv'd Reproaches  Friendship Glory I

thus attend us  Whether we live or die  We're sure of Happiness  I'll destroy the proud Foe in his Glory  From our Presence he shall fly  For I'll conquer or die  To dubious Fear I am a Stranger  Let

Mourning  Provoke not Providence by your Distrust  'Tis time enough to grieve when there's Occasion  Amel  I feel a secret Boding in my Soul  A thousand dismal Apprehensions  By turns torment and rob

Wishes  But still the Immenseness of my Passion  Extends to a far greater Pitch  Than you can think or I express  Aug  So very fond confound her O ye Gods  Rodulpho  to  Amelia  Oh let not Fears  Or

virtuous Wife  Is this the Lover has so often vow'd  Eternal Constancy to me  Is this the Wife so generally fam'd  For exemplary Goodness  How is my Brother and my self abus'd  But he shall know and I'll revenge their Infidelity  Vengeance Vengeance swift overtake 'em  May they never more be blest  May the Gods as wretched make them  As they've render'd me distress'd  Rise ye fierce infernal

see the Fate of War  Is now decided in our Favour  These Chains are not to be compar'd  With the Severities I can inflict  Unless upon the Terms I shall propose  You purchase your Redemption  Casim  Osmyn  I rather choose to die  Than on inglorious Terms to purchase Life  For Death is welcome after this Defeat  Osm  Christian 'tis vain to hope immediate Death  For I'll consummate my Revenge  By a Protraction of thy Misery  Were we to live the Series of an Age  My Vengeance then would be the more compleat  The Eagle with its Prey  Through Aether cuts his way  Retaining fast his trembling Prize

Augusta  aside  Aug  A very kind Embrace  Amel  Give me the Letter 'tis no doubt the last  That I shall from my dearest Lord receive  Come sad Companion of eternal Grief  Let Floods of Tears to Sorrow

Affliction  Aug  No  I have too many Sorrows of my own  You best can sooth her Anguish  Leave me to my self  Rod  I cannot leave you thus  Aug  I will be left this is no time  For idle Compliments

more Objections  I'm positive to follow my Intentions  Or join with me or leave me to my self  Rod  'Twas not on my Account but yours  That I was first induc'd to offer  The wellintended illreceiv'd Advice  Amel  Rodulpho  Well you know my sad Misfortunes  I'm just distracted with a deep Despair  Can you not then excuse the harsh Expression  Rod  Behold yon Wretch that's grov'ling on the Ground  Amel  By all my Hopes of Happiness my Husband    Amelia  running towards  Casimir Rodulpho  withholding her  Rod  For Heaven's sake be not preclpitate  This is no Season for Discovery  Amel  O  Rodulpho  how can I behold him  And be prohibited from speaking to him  Rod  Observe you not a Party near approaching  We're ruin'd if suspected  So the gentle TurtleDove  Bemoans her hapless Captive Love  When in the Fowler's Snare  She strives to free him but in vain  And hovers round and round again  Then drops kill'd by Despair  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Gallery  Augusta  with Attendants  Aug  What gone impossible it cannot be  To leave the Palace thus at Dead of Night  Oh false  Rodulpho  Traitor to Friendship Gratitude and Love  But much more false  Amelia  The faithless Spouse of a distressed Husband  This Conduct will imprint a greater Wound  Than his Defeat and Loss of Liberty  To see such Woes dear  Casimir  oppress  And slighted by a faithless Wife  Fills all my Soul with exquisite Distress  And makes me weary of this Life  But as an Instance of the cordial Love  I to my injur'd Brother bear  I'll by th' immortal Pow'rs that rule above  To Justice bring the guilty Pair  Exit  SCENE III  Osmyn's  Pavilion  Casimir  at the Entry as before  Osmyn Rodulpho  and  Amelia  Osm to  Rod    Tell me my Mussulman  By what happy Chance  Thou didst obtain this matchless Beauty  Rod  On an Escort for Forage near the City  I seiz'd this lovely Christian  By whose majestick Looks inspir'd with Awe  I made a solemn Vow to bring her spotless  To the victorious  Osmyn  Osm  This pleasing Instance of thy Loyalty  Shall e'er be graciously remembred  And thou shalt always be our chief Attendant  To  Amel    Say beauteous Christian  Why thus in Sorrow droops that lovely Head  Thou art not fall'n into Barbarian Hands  Nor wilt thou find us hideous as we're painted  Amel  The Youngling ravish'd from its Nest  Expos'd to Danger stands  But Joy soon warms its panting Breast  When fall'n in gentle Hands  Little alas did I believe  My Life would be restor'd  By your dread Pow'r which most conceive  Is not to be implor'd  Exeunt  Osmyn Amelia  and  Rodulpho  SCENE IV  Casimir  alone  O for a deadly Instrument to end  This most accursed Life  Since what I now endure is past Forbearance  No more it is resolv'd I'll so provoke him  That he must kill me if he has yet remaining  One Spark of Manhood or Resentment  The furious Tiger for a while kept under  Rouses at last and bursts his Chains asunder  Inspir'd with double Rage he flies  Upon his Foes and selfavenging dies  SCENE V  Enter  Osmyn Amelia  and  Rodulpho  Osm  Joy of my Heart the longer I converse  The more I'm ravish'd and delighted  With thy incomparable Wisdom  Thou hast a Soul more beauteous than thy Form  Nor can I live without the blest Enjoyment  Of both those excellent Perfections  Lovely Creature while I'm gazing  Ev'ry Feature more amazing  All my Soul with Raptures charm  If such Pleasure's in beholding  Oh the Transport of infolding  So much Beauty in my Arms  Going on  Casimir  obstructs 'em  Osm  Darest thou obstruct my Way  Dispatch him straight for his Presumption  Sever his Head from his detested Body  Guards go to kill  Casimir Amelia  interposes  Amel  Make here your Way for such a Sight  These Eyes can never bear  To  Osm    Is this your boasted Mildness  What from your Fury may not I expect  By this Example of your Cruelty  How can you vainly thus pretend  To love when yet you hate  For if I should but once offend  I see my instant Fate  Pity and Love to Heaven ally'd  Engross the Godlike Breast  Where Pity's Entrance is deny'd  There Love can never rest  Osm  At your Request he lives  But we'll no longer stay  To hear his Insults  And repent our Mercy  Amel  You say you love me let me be convinced  You plainly do by condescending  To reinstate the Christian in his Liberty  For I am shock'd at this Barbarity  And while my Soul with Horrour overflows  I cannot think of Love  Osm  What is it for your sake  I would not grant  But he's my Enemy avow'd  To give him Freedom is to make him able  To war against us yet a second time  Ask any other Proof of my Affection  And my Compliance waits on your Request  Amel  Too well I am satisfy'd with one Repulse  I shall but ask again to be denied  To  Rod    What shall I do in this Perplexity  Rod  Deny her not this Instance of your Favour  It will remove the Terrour of her Mind  If you release him  Osm  Such is the Ardour of my Passion  That I'll engage her at the dearest Rate  To her  To let you see my Charmer  I give your Love the preference  Above all other Views whatsoever  At your immediate Intercession  This Christian has his Liberty restor'd  I only ask the Tribute of your Heart  As a Return of Gratitude  Amel  Who would not with Gladness surrender  A Heart to a Lover so tender  Whose Actions his Passion declare  Assist me bright Goddess of Beauty  And  Cupid  instruct me my Duty  To make all his Wishes my Care    Osm  to  Cas    Christian  At the Request of this celestial Creature  You have your Life and Liberty  Cas  Angel of Goodness  That from the deep Abyss of Desperation  Has call'd me forth to Life again  Once more to come to my  Amelia  's Arms  Osm  No more we will not hear your tedious Thanks  Your Presence only aggravates my Wrath  So fly while you have free Permission  Casim  To the Arms of my Dearest I'm flying  Who doubtless with Sorrow is dying  Despairing to see me again  Above all the World I adore her  O how will my Presence restore her  And ease her disconsolate Pain  Exit  Casimir  SCENE VI  Osmyn Amelia  Osm  Now the delightful Object of my Soul  Remains there any Favour yet unask'd  That you can wish or I confer  Amel  Victorious  Osmyn  I need no other proof of your Affection  Osm  To one so fair and kind  Amel  To such a generous Mind  Both  Surpassing all Treasure  Who would not with Pleasure  A Heart sincere resign  Osm  I ne'er can leave thee  Amel  I'll ne'er deceive thee  Both  For ever I am thine  The End of the Second Act  AMELIA  ACT III SCENE I  A Room in  Casimir  's Palace  Augusta  alone  AUGUSTA  _A Brother injured

Offers to kill herself  SCENE II  Casimir  enters  Cas  Why with uplifted Arms and pointed Steel  Seek'st thou  Augusta  to destroy  A Life that's not thy own  Aug  Ye Gods it is my dear my injured Brother  O  Casimir  this is a dismal Meeting  Cas  Is this my welcome  What is the meaning of this odd Reception  Aug  Ask me not  Too soon alas you'll learn  The woeful Reason  Cas  Distract me not but tell me where's  Amelia  Aug  Would she were dead  Cas  Curs'd be the Tongue that utters such a Thought  Is there the Wretch can wish  Amelia  dead  And art thou she  Leave this unnatural Sister  Casimir  And seek thy Love thy dear  Amelia  Aug  Aside  Unhappy Man I cannot undeceive him  Lest that upon so shocking a Relation  Some direful Resolution should ensue  Exit  Cas  My Charmer's very Name  Does all my Soul inflame  And fills my Heart with Joy  May both our Troubles cease  And everlasting Peace  Our future Time employ  Exit  SCENE III  A Room in  Osmyn's  Pavilion  Rodulpho  alone  The happy Time will soon approach  In which  Augusta  's Jealousy shall have  A most agreeable Determination  For when she knows that this our quiet Departure  Was to effect dear  Casimir  's Redemption  Her Love now smother'd by unjust Suspicions  Will reassume a greater Blaze  Enter  Amelia  in a Fright  Amel  Save me  Rodulpho  Osmyn  no longer will admit Denial  I must or die or yield to his Embraces  Rod  Amuse him with Pretences of Compliance  Then when alone unguarded and dissolved  He's wholly in your Power This to his Heart  Offers her a Dagger  Amel  What would you have me murder him  Rodulpho  Rod  Call not that Murder Princess which is Justice  Amel  I will not purchase Liberty so dear  Sooner I'll kill myself  Rod  I then suppose you love this vile Barbarian  Amel  'Tis false I hate him to the last degree  But yet I'll not imbrue my Hands in Blood  And base Assassination  Rod  If you're afraid to prosecute th' Attempt  I'll pierce him with the fatal Instrument  Amel  Rodulpho  be not rash in your Proposals  Who knows but some bless'd Turn  When least expected  May profer Liberty on easier Terms  Let not Mortals tempt their Fate  But for Heaven's Decision wait  And by Resignation show  What to Providence they owe  That just Power which weighs the Crime  Points the Punishment and Time  Sure tho' late will interpose  And save the injur'd from their Foes  SCENE IV  Casimir  alone in an Apartment  Cas  She's false insufferably false  Then farewel Truth and Virtue  Osmyn  restore me to my Chains again  For my  Amelia  's Usage far exceeds  All the Barbarity you could invent  Goes to kill himself  Enter  Augusta  Aug  Why  Casimir  with sacrilegious Hands  Dost thou attempt what late thou didst condemn  Cas  O my dear Sister Sharer of my Grief  Can you forgive those passionate Expressions  Which lately came from my unwary Tongue  Aug  It was the height of Love for lost  Amelia  Which caus'd the inconsiderate Resentment  Cas  But nowI find your Wish was just  The causeless Passion makes me more uneasy  Aug  No more my dearest Brother  But let us now revenge the gross Offence  Cas  Augusta  your Advice I shall accept  And put it in immediate Execution  Just Heav'ns in my Resentments join  The Cause is yours as well as mine  And Vengeance doubtless is our due  O let me while I thus complain  See both the Adulterers once again  To vindicate myself and you  Exeunt  SCENE V  Amelia  and  Rodulpho  Amel  Rodulpho  you have shewn a Friendship  Which will admit of no Comparison  O bless'd tho' mean Disguise in which array'd  We have

resolve him nothing  But still let this unjust Suspicion plague him  Till a fit Time to prove our Innocence  Enter  Casimir  Cas Disguis'd  O vile lascivious Pair  Rod  O  Casimir  Cas  You have framed no doubt  Some well concerted Story  But I'm deaf to every thing but Vengeance  Take from my Presence such detested Objects  Ah Traitress wicked and impure  How can I possibly endure  To see that odicus Face  Oh that my Heart had not been set  On one who could her Truth forget  To suffer such Disgrace  Exeunt  SCENE VII  An Apartment in  Osmyn  's Pavilion  Osmyn  alone  It's certain she is fled but who could think  That in such beautiful Perfection  Ingratitude could be conceal'd  'Twas for her sake I condescended  To grant the Christian Life and Liberty  So much her Charms have ravish'd all my Soul  That with the fair delusive Creature  Are all my Hopes of Comfort fled  Now all my Conquests are insipid  The World and all its rich Possessions  Cannot redress the Anguish I conceive  By this one Woman's Imposition  All my Glories I resign  For a Life that's Divine  In a lonely desart Cell  I'll in sweet Retirement dwell  Unmolested I intend  All my future Years to spend  Now adieu ye worldly Joys  Shortlived Splendor Courts and Noise  There I only hope to find  Solitude and Peace of Mind  Exit  SCENE VIII  A Prison  Rodulpho  alone  Rod  To what a hazardous Presumption  Amelia  carries her Resentment  But there's no reason I should venture Life  Upon the Caprice of a Woman  This Letter shall to  Casimir  unfold  The whole of our proceeding  SCENE IX  A great Hall  Amelia  going to Execution  After a dead March Enter  Augusta  Aug  Now Traitress take the just Reward  Your heinous Crimes demand  Nor shall  Rodulpho  long survive you  Amel  O let me see my Husband ere I die  Aug  It is in vain to pray for Mercy now  Amel  What has my Obstinacy brought upon me  I have murdered both  Rodulpho  and myself  Aug  Why is her Death delay'd  Dispatch her instantly  Amel  Since I must die I must submit  But let  Rodulpho  's Life be spar'd  And tell my  Casimir  we are the Persons  Who sav'd him from the barb'rous Cruelty  Which the Grand Visier threaten'd on him  Tell him I die his chaste and loving Wife  And that  Rodulpho  is his faithful Friend  More he will know perhaps when it's too late  Amelia  wishes when she dies  Her dearest Lord may close her Eyes  And Heaven may open his  Then will he wish but all in vain  To have her render'd back again  From Realms of endless Bliss  Enter  Casimir  snatching the Headman's Sword  Rodulpho  follows  Cas  O live  Amelia  live thou best of Wives  Rodulpho  live thou most sincere of Friends  Embrace him Sister  Who with my dear  Amelia  Effected my Deliverance from Death  Bless'd be the Day

Unkinder you that could be so suspicious  Cas  No more reproaches  But let one general rejoicing  Run through our Hearts on this Occasion  Cas Amel  Let me press thee O my Charmer  To a Heart that's only thine  Never Passion sure was warmer  Never more did Souls combine  Casimir  to  Rodulpho  and  Amelia  A double Nuptial shall resplend the Day  For to reward the Friendship of  Rodulpho  I give  Augusta  to his longing Arms  And as we've all been equally concerned  In a Variety of great Misfortunes  So let us now unanimously share  This unexpected Interval of Mirth  O my  Amelia  Pattern to thy Sex  This Act of thine convey'd to latest Ages  With Honour and Applause  Shall spread thy Fame  And Thousands yet unborn revere thy Name  CHORUS  When Dangers Innocence invade  Just Heav'n
