Pence  THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER  'TIS not so much the Itch of being thought an Author nor of following the Method of those Writers whether Originals or Translators especially the last who think Prefacing so necessary that rather than forego their Opinion they will spoil a good Work for the sake of a HalfSheet of their own Scribbling that induces me to attempt one in this Place If I had had no particular Advantage in so doing I must without Flattery inform you that I had wav'd the Trouble But since 'twas necessary pray take it and make the best on't And now all I have to say is to make these Pages have a good Run  which I cannot pretend to do by any Elogy on 'em but refer you to the Perusal It has indeed Two of the Best Recommendations Book can have at this Time It is like our Fashions FRENCH And as the  Gallican  Mode tho' never so ridiculously adjusted upon an  English  Person meets not only with Reception but Encouragement I'm in great Hopes the very Place of this Pamphlet's Birth will hide the Blunders of the Version And then 'tis against the JESUITES If with these Two Qualities it should not meet Acceptation I shall be apt to think  Diogenes  who would be bury'd with his Face downwards that when the World turn'd upsidedown which in his Days he expected he might lye right in his Grave has now got his Wish and by the Illvent of this Commodity judge that all the BEAUX GOOD PROTESTANTS and WELLMEANING PAPISTS if any such there be are lost in the Hurricane  A CURIOUS Little Oration Deliver'd by Little Father ANDREW c  _IT was one  Lent  and about the Time that Monsieur  Arnaud  had his Famous Disputes with the JESUITES I mean when JANSENISM was at the greatest height a Fantome which the jealous Cunning of those good Fathers knew how to improve  to the Detriment and Prosecution of many better  Christians  that  Little Father ANDREW  so famous for his  Witty Jokes  preach'd at  Alby  ACCORDING to the Custom this LITTLE Good Man on the  Samaritan  's Day did not fail to make a Discourse on Grace and what was more upon Efficacious Grace by it self And solidly proved from St  Augustin  's Principles That no one ever resisted that Grace not but that Men can but will not for its Attribute is just to inspire what we will not oppugn He added That sufficient Grace was a New System broach'd by the JESUIT  Molina  to reconcile the pretended Contradictions of its Omnipotent Power with Freewill In short he asserted  Jansenism  to the last Degree  THOSE of the Society who were present at this Sermon being nettled to hear  Molina  's Reverend School used at this Rate took it as you may well suppose in great Dudgeon and resolved to load the Poor Preacher with  the heavy Weight of their Holy and Implacable Fury They extracted several Tenets which in their Opinion contain'd the most poisonous Venom of Heresy pack'd away to the Archbishop of  Alby  and giving the Contents into his Hand  Is it not an Errant Shame  say they with a Zeal animated not for the Glory of God but of the Society  Is it not a Shame my Lord That this Little Whisk of a Monk shall come hither to preach  JANSENISM  Tooth and Nail whilst the Pope Bishops Kings Magistrates and indeed all Powers as well Ecclesiastick as Secular are endeavouring to root this Cockle out of the Field of the  CHURCH  THE Archbishop who knew by Experience how necessary their GoodWill was at that Time to the making of a Man's Fortune and on the contrary the Danger as well as Inconveniency of being hated by them the Archbishop I say came into their Resentments and promised them condign and speedy Satisfaction He cited  Little Father ANDREW  and sharply rebuked him for having  preach'd up Heresy not without terrible Threats of inflicting on him the Punishments ordain'd in such Cases by the Canons of the Church  THE  Little  Priest who was too well acquainted with the JESUITES not to know that they were not to be offended with Impunity and that whoever offered to contradict their Notions was at least a Heretick gave a shrewd Guess at what was coming and therefore was not mightily dismay'd at the Bishop's thundering Reprimand but with a becoming Presence of Mind made this Answer  God preserve me my Lord from Preaching Heresy I can assure you I never had the least Intention to deviate from the Sentiments of the  Catholick Church  some unguarded Expressions may perhaps in the Heat of Discourse have fallenn from me which having met with an Evil Construction have given Room for the Accusation now intended against me Therefore be pleased my Lord to let me know what Heretical Propositions I am charg'd with advancing that I may confront them with my  SERMON    which contains no such Matters and if I have said any Thing that is not Orthodox I will retract it next  Sunday  and by my Recantation undeceive those whom I have scandaliz'd by my Imprudence  THE Archbishop satisfied with this Submission of the  Little  FATHER deliver'd to him the Paper which contain'd such of his Propositions as were condemn'd by the JESUITES and gave those  Cunningham  's as  A  French  Burlesque Author  Guy Patin  calls them an Account of what had passed who for once were out in their Politicks and sung  Io Paean  before the Victory loudly publishing through the Town the intended Recantation of  Little Father ANDREW  They cloy'd themselves beforehand with the mighty Pleasure they were to receive from the great Shame which they pretended he would be obliged at that Time to undergo  HEAVEN knows there was no want of them at  Sunday  's Sermon and they had taken special Care to invite all their Partisans and to place themselves over against the Preacher that they might more fully rejoice at his Confusion They that knew the LITTLE Father better did not doubt of finding this Sermon curiously intermix'd with Scenes of Mirth So that with those who were of the  Jesuitical  Faction and those who came to the unravelling of the LITTLE Gentleman's late Discourse there was a very numerous Audience  FATHER ANDREW got into the Pulpit and after having cross'd himself said  Sirs▪ before I take my Text give me Leave to recount to you a Vision I had the other Night▪ You may now perhaps think me a superstitiou  Coxcomb for coming hither to tell you my Dreams▪ yet when I let you know that I hope I am in the Number of those Servants to whom our Lord is pleas'd to manifest his Will in a misteriou  Manner As I think my Vision Instructive and besides that it will not be tiresome to you I can boldly beg your Attention to what follows  THIS Exordium attracted anew the Ears of all  Sirs  continues this Little Father  The  Night I dreamt that I was carry'd before the Tribunal of Jesus Christ to be Judg'd T  ink with your selves what a Terror invaded me an unpenitent and unprepar'd Sinner I was horribly frighten'd and my Fears increas'd when the Son of God thus accosted me  Come near  Andrew  that I may judge you  Seiz'd at once with Fear and Respect I threw my  at his Feet  Hark'ye  says our Lord to me with an irritated Aspect  Was it not to lead My Flock of  Alby  into saving Pastures that I gave you to that Fold and yet instead of nourishing them with sound Doctrines you are accus'd of preaching Heresy My God  says I  I preach Heresy You who  search the Reins and Heart  know perfectly I had no such intention and if by Ignorance or Weakness I have had the Misfortune to advance any Doctrines that are inconsistent with Thy Holy Verities I am here ready to suffer whatever Punishment Your Divine Majesty shall please to inflict on me Have not you  return'd our Saviour  preach'd up such and such Tenets And  then Father  Andrew  cited the very Passages condemn'd by the  Jesuites  My Dear Redeemer  continued I  I confess I have but hitherto I thought they were not in the least Heretical for I took them from a very Great Master What Mighty Master is this  says our Saviour  'Tis St  Thomas  of  Aquin  that Angel of the School which You of late Ages have rais'd to be the Pillar of Truth and Scourge of Heresy And 'tis so evident that this Great Doctor has taught what they condemn as Hetorodox in me that my Quotationi  s Word for Word his SentimentsAnd then the LITTLE PRIEST made a Repetition of what St  Thomas  had written on that Subject  Man is converted by his FreeWill but His FreeWill can never effect his Conversion if God Himself works it not in him according to the Words of the Prophet  Jeremy    Convert me O Lord and I shall be converted because Thou art my God  S Th Q Art ad  Altho' Man has Grace he cannot of himself do Good and avoid Evil without a new Aid and Incitement from God which must lead him to and  rengthen him in the Performance of Good Deeds  id Art    which Passages  were exactly consonant to those the  Jesuites  had declar'd Damnable  HO HO  says our Lord  Let him come before me Appear  Thomas  Is it possible that you who have been so highly honour'd by Me that you of whom I have render'd so glorious a Testimony as that you have well written of Me Is it possible that you could notwithstanding all these Favours pretend to teach that My will must infallibly and necessarily be accomplish'd when I am pleas'd that Man shall consent to My Grace not from an Absolute Necessity but from an Infallible Necessity which nevertheless does not obstruct FreeWill Yes my Dear Saviour  reply'd Saint  Thomas I did teach this Doctrine I assert it And I took it from St  Bernard  that Devout and Famous Doctor who is accounted the Last of the Fathers of Thy Holy Church 'Tis he that  has taught such and such Doctrines in such and such Places of his Writings And then Father ANDREW recited all the Passages in St  Bernard    What Can you believe your selves to be the Principals or Authors of your own Merits▪ And that you have Power to insure your Salvation simply by your own Good Deeds You that cannot so much as  pronounce the Sacred Name of  Jesus  with out the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost  Presumptuou  Men Have you forgot his Words who says  With out Me you can do nothing  You will answer  W  good then does FreeWill  And I in few return  sav'd by Grace  Thus  Take away FreeWill there  nothing left to save a Man take away Grace FreeW  loses the only Means it had to save  St Bern de Grace Lib Arbit Cap  When a Man is fallen into Sin by his own prope  Will he cannot by the same Will retrieve himself▪ God having been pleas'd to put it in  Adam  's Power to stand fast without falling but not having give  him Power to recover himself after his Fall And  this any great Wonder For as a Man ever falls easily down a Precipice from the Hurt of which Fall he cannot so easily recover himself So when he ha  precipitated himself into a Profundity of Sin he has no Power to go back not being able to forbear Sinning tho' his Desire may be clean conttary  Ibid Chap    concerning Efficacious Grace▪  What means all this  says Jesus Christ  Is sweet St  Bernard a Jansenist  then Call him What  Bernard  with your meek and sanctify'd Air would one think you capable of asserting that My Grace has an absolute Power over FreeWill and yet that this same Grace does not hinder the FreeWill and that every Man acts infallibly as well as freely when I please to attract him to Me by the Sweetness of My efficacious Inspirations Can it be true that you have taught all this Yes my Saviour  says St  Bernard I'll stand to't but St  Augustine  is my Guarantee and I ought to refer to him because Your Church not only approves what he has written concerning Grace but has in a Manner canoniz'd his Opinion of it in making use of that Doctor's Sayings only to exemplify its Sentiments on that Matter And then the Little Man set himself to work to give the Audience divers Texts in St  Augustine  The Holy Spirit so far inspires Men's Will upon Earth that they do Good because they  will  it and they  will  that Good because God works them a Will thereto  St Aug de Cor de Gr  Chap    N    When God will save no Man's FreeWill  resist this Salvation  Ibid Chap    that prov'd the invincible Efficacy and Omni+potence of Grace  HAS  Augustine    says our Lord  who ha  shar'd so abundantly of my Love and who is so indispensably bound to acknowledge the Effects of it taught all this I must find out his Master  Augustin  who taught you that My Grace has an absolute Influence over Man's Will and disposes of it entirely by the Sovereignty it has over it equally with the rest of the Creatures under My Canopy Who was your Preceptor St  Paul  my Sa+viour Is it St  Paul  My Apostle Yes 't  Your Apostle St  Paul  and  It is God which worketh in you both  Will and to Do of His good Pleasure  Phil  Chap  xiii  he teaches that You promote in us whatever You think fit and that 'tis You who form in us  Will and the Action What means all this  says our Redeemer  Then there are none but  Jansenists  in Heaven Call St  Paul  to Me and let him answer this I must find out the Root of this Circumstance Come Mr St  Paul  tell us plainly Have you taught the Doctrine you are accus'd of concerning Efficacious Grace working by it self Who taught you that My Divine Inspiration must infallibly prevail because Man's Will must consent freely Who should teach it me but Your Own Self my God Of whom should I learn it but of the Holy Ghost who replenish'd my Heart I set my Hand to Paper and the Divine Spirit dictated And is not the Confirmation of these grand Truths palpable in a thousand Places of Scripture  No Man can come to Me except the Father which hath sent Me draw him  John  vi  It is written in the Prophets And they shall be all taught of God Every Man therefore that hath Heard and hath learn'd of the Father cometh unto Me  Ibid    No Man can come unto Me except it were give  unto him of My Father  Ibid    From that Time many of His Disciples went bac  and walked no more with Him  Ibid    Abide in Me and I in you As the Branch can+not bear the Fruit of it self except it abide in th  Vine no more can ye except ye abide in Me  am the Vine ye are the Branches He that abidet  in Me and I in him the same bringeth forth mucH Fruit For without Me you can do nothing  Ibid  Chap xv  And have not You Your Self  deliver'd them from Your Sacred Mouth▪ I have indeed  says our Redeemer  I have taugh  this Doctrine and have left it to my Church as a precious Inheritance  BUT I know very well the Origin of  this Call me hither Father  Ignatius Th  Good Saint who could hardly be found amon  the Crowd appear'd at last  And now the  Jesuites  trembled with In+dignation Come hither Father  Ignatius  yo  are a very Good Man and Humble I wou  not have you take it ill But I suppose yo  you cannot have forgot that when you wer  Five and Thirty Years old you were like a Boy of Five among the young Students in the College of St  Barbe  by the same Token that you were often Lash'd for your Childish Tricks I have bestow'd my Heaven on you Nor do I reproach you now Seeing you are in it you are welcome to it But your Children are mere Firebands Proud Priests who would impose on the Faithful their newfoisted and erroneous Doctrines or the ancient and orthodox Belief of My Church I charge you to humble them 'Tis a hard Task I own but I command you again to go about it and if you cannot accomplish it I My Self will put a helping Hand and humble them to the Dust that think themselves the only Lights of the Church  Sirs This is my Dream but since 'tis no more than a Dream you may give what Credit  please to it  POSTSCRIPT  THAT the Reader of the preceding Pages may see how that Holy that Sanctify'd Society is abus'd by those Varlet  the  Jansenists  take a Character of the Founde  of the Jesuitical Order St  Ignatius  In his Youth being Nobly Born he behav'd himself like those of the present Age wh  have the Opportunity and Means we wi  not talk of Whoring Drinking  c  as bein  unworthy of such a Founder buthe liv  some Time at Court and as the Courtie  commonly use to do he brought a  Nob  to  When he was reduc'd God visited hi  and then he turn'd Saint and wrought in  +nite Miracles  And always in his Performances had  particular Kindness for Women in Labour▪ For  Ignatius  's Name would fright the Chi  from the Woman as safely and easily  a  Jesuit  denying Absolution would fright  poor Penitent that knows nothing of  Matter  Much more of this Good Saint's Life  Conversation you may read in that Celebrat  Book intitled  The Provincial Letter  Writ  by
