 MOMUS A POEM OR A CRITICAL EXAMINATION INTO THE MERITS of the PERFORMERS AND COMIC PIECES AT THE THEATRE ROYAL in the HAYMARKET  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR And Sold by J ALMON opposite BurlingtonHouse PICCADILLY And J WILLIAMS No next the Mitre Tavern FLEETSTREET  MOMUS  NO more shall Monkey's mimicry engage  No more shall Cats and Dog susurp the stage  Alluding to Signior  Placido  's Monkey  c    See  Momus'  sons a single unit higher  Divert the town with his detractive fire  While patents royal are to  Merit  thrown  To please Sir  Fns  and a tasteless town  See  Fte  the foremost of the mimic race  Amuse the town with scandal and grimace  While private characters each scene adorn  Held up by him to meet the public scorn  Where custom's brought on some peculiar mode  Of speech or air out of the common road  If but deficient in a leg or eye  Or from misfortune chance to look awry  This  maimed  mimic favour'd so by fate  That he might still more truly imitate  With selfvain zeal a stupid laugh to raise  He with a low audacity conveys  His borrow'd puns with a sarcastic face  Join'd by the meanest of the acting race  Without restraint his dearest friends expose  But  Fte  and friendship are eternal foes  Never did folly with such sway maintain  Her seat and with her baby rattle reign  Over  Apollo  and his laurell'd sons  With  glees  and  catches mimicry  and  puns  Like the loud Quack in some small country town  Who with his fool entices ev'ry clown  To see his pranks and filthy drugs to vend  And with a  puff  their quality commend  So  Fte  like him his own loud trumpet blows  And with a  puff  his trash for wit impose  As wrecks and rubbish follow every tide  So ev'ry blockhead joins the laughing side  Blest with a face of humour to engage  At once a drooping and a laughing age  Shtr  with some pretensions to a name  Stands forth distinguish'd in the book of fame  The grateful public will for humour take  Whatever blunder he may chance to make  Who fond of laughter oddity and whim  Have fix'd the mask of Comedy on him  With face by  Bacchus  or by  Venus  marr'd  For he's with both the mighty powers warr'd  In word expressive and in gesture dry  In action simple with a meaning eye  See  Weston  gravely force the hearty smile  Nor pall with low buffoonery the while  Whene'er in  Sneak  or  Drugger  he appears  Garrick  attends with patient eyes and ears  And owns his humour natural and true  For  Garrick  must give genius her due  See  De Ds  better half the year  A mere poltroona hero now appear  Unnotic'd and obscure he struts unknown  An utter stranger to the injur'd town  Till  Fte  his patron impotent and  wise  At once convinces each beholder's eyes  That merit oft beneath oppression dwells  For see how  Ds  now himself excells  Aimwell Cassio  nay and many more  Such parts were never acted so before  And that my Muse may shew her meaning plain  Hopes ne'er to see 'em murder'd so again  An arrant stroller from the lord knows where  A true itinerant now here now there  Who oft from barn to barn from town to town  Ten nights has labour'd for a single crown  See  Bnnr  assume unaw'd by shame  A mimic's vile and despicable name  There's no degree of acting all allow  So very puerile infamous or low  For who e'er knew a mimic yet inherit  The smallest grain of genius or of spirit  And has it not for ever been a rule  To join a mimic's name with that of fool  The laughingstock of candour and of fame  A very monkey with a human name  But joins not he then in a blockhead's cause  That yields them favour or that gives applause  Each man of reason and of judgment must  Confess it neither laudable or just  Bnnr  a  Wilkinson  would be  But can't so truly imitate as he  To ape the manner of some better play'r  An act ungen'rous at the best unfair  Why should one actor villainously try  To damn another in the public eye  Either by malice or by envy led  To hurt his brother in his fame or bread  When to the world 'tis evidently known  He ne'er could boast a method of his own  Such are a pest and scandal to the stage  And who but  Fte  would any such engage  Why don't the candid and insulted town  In justice cry these imitators down  For all must own the stage was ne'er design'd  To point at this or that but all mankind  E'en devotees must own the stage of use  Where it don't leave  instruction  for  abuse  Lead by conceit and fond of stage applause  Yet stands condemn'd if judg'd by acting laws  With face nor voice nor action to commend  Or win one single auditor his friend  See  Swn  great in capitals appear  Disgust the eye and grate the dullest ear  For he most surely of all human kind  Was ne'er by nature for the stage design'd  Long in  Hibernia  has he trod the field  Where judgment oft to prejudice must yield  And with no small indulgence and regard  Tho' ev'ry night some noble part he marr'd  See him return declining and in age  Riding his only HobbyHorse the stage  And with a boyish zeal the toy embrace  Tho' time with years has wrinkled o'er his face  Of vulgar accent and of bully's  pink  A rolling sidle with a  knowing wink  Coarse and robust who might perhaps engage  Had he been cast on the  Broughtonian  stage  Plr  selfconfident attempts to please  In highwrote parts of elegance and ease  But like to him who roll'd the stone in vain  Will ne'er the summit of his hopes attain  Yet must we own him some small share of praise  When  Bruin Loader  and such parts he plays  He's sure to please while in this line he steers  For in such parts he still  himself  appears  Then let him ever in that track remain  Where he is sure some small applause to gain  And never more in gentlemen and beaux  Disgrace the stage the author and the cloaths  Barry  each season might delight the town  But that we've better actors of our own  Yet think not  Barry  that I will disgrace  Or mean to herd thee with the common race  Thou art an  Actor  ev'ry judge must own  And many years a fav'rite of the town  Till  Powell  chanc'd within thy walk to tread  And pluck'd the blooming laurel from thy head  Yet in  Othello  must each actor yield  There even  Garrick  must give up the field  And own thee for the part by nature fram'd  We think of  Barry  when  Othello  's nam'd  Not so thy son when in each part he tries  To copy thee too oft from nature flies  Yet will it faintly bear the name of fault  To follow close the manners we are taught  From thee his ev'ry method he conceiv'd  From thee each beauty and each fault receiv'd  Nor should we deem him destitute of art  Did he with decency perform  one  part  O could my ardent yet unwilling Muse  Obtain one kind and plausible excuse  And without censure be indulged to spare  And overlook the errors of the fair  But chaste  Astrea  guides my feeble hand  And will not listen to my warm demand  Blest with a form of elegance and ease  Two requisites that must for ever please  Who for a season might perhaps engage  When  Yates  awhile retires from the stage  See  Dancer  now each highrate part possess  And try to picture virtue and distress  But judgment seems to leave her in the dark  Whene'er she aims to hit the doubtful mark  With bold presumption in despite of shame  Jffs  attempts to join the rank of fame  And void of judgment attitude and speech  She aims at characters above her reach  When poor  Alicia  with distraction raves  And calls for racks for thunderbolts and graves  Did  Cinderilla  ever scold so well  When in her airs she bid you  go to hll  When drove by love and passion to despair  And having lost all hopes begins to swear  So sad  Alicia  when by  Jffs  play'd  A mere impetuous termagant betray'd  Forgive me  Jffs  that I speak my mind  True satire never leaves one fault behind  But since she's brought thy errors forth to view  So shall she speak of thy perfections too  In thirdrate parts where nature don't require  Such skill in action or such force of fire  When nor by pride nor by ambition led  Content the paths of moderation tread  There spite of censure shalt thou justly raise  The smile of pleasure and the voice of praise  See one in parts of wit and humour strive  To catch the manner of a  Pope  or  Clive    For  Gdr  the copyist betrays  In ev'ry part of humour that she plays  And from her acting it is plainly shewn  She likes their manner better than her own  But such a barren genius declares  Who having no invention borrows theirs  Oglevie  's pretty and genteel I own  And has some little sparks of genius shewn  Time and instruction may in her produce  With some small pains an actress of use  Behind appear a despicable race  Without one single requisite or grace  Beneath the notice of my honest Muse  And but to mention would herself abuse  Names both to genius and to fame unknown  The needy stragglers of each country town  Fit but to form some necessary group  Or to compleat  Fte  's miserable troop  When furnish'd out with truncheons and with cloaths  See 'em a  royal company  compose  By these enforc'd and arm'd with impudence  See him invade the boundaries of sense  Break thro' the rules of genius and taste  And lay with ridicule their kingdoms waste  Pleas'd with his own behold the mocker strive  With some success his  Grubstreet  to revive  And ev'ry season palls us with the same  Till jaded patience sickens at his name  Each man of candour must in this agree  His merit lies in inconsistency  In art theatric destitute of skill  Yet makes a figure in a puffing bill  In this judicious 'tis a crafty snare  To catch the vulgar and to make 'em stare  Pleas'd with the promise of the joyous fun  Away to  Fte  's the herd unthinking run  He gains his riches at the fool's expence  Despis'd and shunn'd by ev'ry man of sense  High on  Parnassus  wou'd he wish to ride  And unrestrain'd the winged courser stride  But is it not most evident to all  The limping Bard has had a fatal fall  A famous playwrite wou'd he seem to be  A very Phoenix to posterity  Grief that his name must with his body die  And all his bantlings with their father lie  When lacking his distortion and grimace  Their sole protection and their only grace  Spurn'd and detested in some wiser age  Will never more get footing on the stage  Of these the  Minor  at the head we see  Born at the time of his necessity  When threaten'd by the horrors of a j  Was forc'd to hoist up ev'ry tatter'd sail  And must have sunk had not the tortur'd  Cole  Who like a Pirate he unjustly stole  Buoy'd him when sinking to the welcome shore  And sav'd at once his vessel and his store  The  Lyar  too  his masterpeice confess'd  Vide  one of his Puffs in the  Gazetter  on  Thursday  the th of  July    A very sustianjacket at the best  At  CoventGarden  long ago cry'd down  Hiss'd and condemn'd by the insulted town  The  Mayor of Garret  next we bring to view  Which we must own both laughable and new  But candour will admit of no excuse  Where she beholds such personal abuse  His  Patron Commissary  even all  His drolls beneath this censure fall  His  Orators  a very hodgepodge see  Made up of rubbish and absurdity  Cramm'd full of puns of nonsense and parade  With neither plot or meaning to its aid  And while to wit he makes a false pretence  Or tries to introduce one line of sense  With vain attempt he stammers at the task  A very  Midas  in  Apollo  's mask  These grown quite threadbare and worn out with age  Like  Fte  himself a nuisance to the stage  He's brought his  Taylors  like a thrifty friend  To botch their elbows and their linings mend  With royal sanction force 'em on the town  When they are sick of better treatment grown  Did  Smithfield  e'er produce a bill so rare  When  Punchinello  was the hero there  Did ever  Flockton  's tragedy excell  Was ever shewbill drawn up half so well  Did ever Quack with such parade engage  Not even  Rk  when he adorn'd the stage  Did Taylor e'er with patchwork form a coat  And without  measure  too as  Fte  has wrote  Did ever playwrite exercise his quill  With  half  that  humour  or with  half  that  skill  And stock'd like him with  true poetic lore  Write such a  Taylor  's  tragedy  before  Try'd and condemn'd by th' indulgent town  The father won't his newborn idiot own  But fain wou'd bribe the bawdy muse its mother  To lay the frightful monster on another  To drop it at some door or else to smother  Yet if with close inspection you shou'd trace  The striking outlines of the infant's face  The father's strong resemblance you'll behold  As die to die cast in the selfsame mould  As Epicurians with luxuriant waste  Who lose at once their appetite and taste  And try to teaze the stomach ev'ry hour  With something sweet or else with something sour  Or when the rake is quite indiff'rent grown  Sated with all the pleasures of the town  See him from place to place with transport fly  In search of pleasure and variety  When sick of  high life  he begins to grow  He tries to find a relish in the  low    Fte  next arises to his vacant mind  For there he's sure the coarsest fare to find  Tho' coarse yet light and easy to digest  Nor hurt the head before it meets the breast  No heavy sentence to perplex the brain  No searching morals on the mind remain  But like the froth dissolving in the taste  And ere it meets the lip begins to waste  While in our ears he dins the mighty pother  It enters one and hurries out at t'other  FINIS
