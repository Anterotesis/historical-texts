II and King  James  II  Publish'd with a Preface by his Son  WHITLOCKE BULSTRODE  Esq  LONDON  Printed for JONAS BROWNE at the  Black Swan  without  TempleBar  MDCCXV  To the Right Honourable  CHARLES  EARL of HALLIFAX First Lord Commissioner of the Trea∣sury one of the Lords of His Ma∣jesty's most Honourable PrivyCoun∣cil and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter  c  My LORD  T  HE Obligations I have received from your Lord∣ship for many Years past and the Continu∣ance of them to this Time  do justly call for a Publick Acknowledgment on the first Opportunity I had to make it  Having nothing of my own worth Presenting to your Lordship I have with your Permission dedi∣cated some Essays of my Fa∣ther's to your Lordship's Perusal  I know how delicate a Taste your Lordship has that you have adorned your Mind both with University and Polite Learning so that were I not entirely satisfied that the Thoughts in them are not common and were they not my Father's I  should say that they are writ in the smooth Stile of a Courtier with the Spi∣rit and Air of a Gentleman and with the Strength of a Man of Letters I shou'd not have presum'd to have inscrib'd your Lordship's Name before them  How he was qualified to write these Essays the Pre∣face mentions I shall only add that during the Time of his Foreign Embassy which lasted about Thirty Years he laid out his Hours between Books Men of the most polite Parts and Affairs of the greatest Mo∣ment  He had the Pleasure of near twenty Years Retire∣ment before his Death which was at a hundred and one to recollect his Observations of Men and Things and put them in the Dress in which your Lordship sees them  There are some of them indeed that seem not to have pass'd his last Hands which therefore are not so correct as they would have been had he liv'd to have finish'd them But when I consider that the first Draughts of a  Raphael Titi∣an  or  Reuben  are preserved with great Care tho' not  finish'd I thought it best to let them pass as they are  The many great Services your Lordship has done the Publick have been ex∣pressed by so many that it will be hard to avoid Re∣petition  However for a Noble∣man at the Head of Af∣fairs at Court to move with a great Regard to the Liber∣ty and Property of the Sub∣ject steady to the Reform'd Religion in the worst of Times that advances not Prerogative beyond its le∣gal Bounds that has the Good of the Nation at Heart and that acts with  great Sincerity are Virtues that can never be sufficient∣ly admir'd by all true  En∣glishmen  and particularly by  My LORD  Your Lordship's Most Faithful and Most Obedient Servant WHIT BULSTRODE  THE PREFACE  I  Think it necessary to give some Account of the Author of the fol∣lowing Essays and like∣wise of the Essays themselves the rather because being Posthumous Works the Genuiness of them might be otherwise doubted  As for the Author Sir  Richard Bulstrode  he was the Son of  Edward Bulstrode  of the  InnerTemple  Esq  whose Reports are extant he came abroad into the World well stock'd with University Learning was bred at the  InnerTemple  call'd to the Bar and practis'd as a Barrister 'till the Civil Wars breaking out put a Stop to the Current of the Law and  being then a young Man and of an active Spirit betook himself to the Army and was of the Royal Side where he behaved himself so well that in a little time he was made AdjutantGeneral to the Army of King  Charles  the First After the Return of the Royal Family he had a Place at Court some time after he was appointed to be at the Court of  Brussels  as Resident from King  Charles  the Second on whose Death he was made Envoy by King  James  the Second to the same Court his whole Ministry there being about thirty Years during which Time he held Correspondence with most of the Courts of  Christendom  as I find by his Letters made up into Annals which I have by me  When his Royal Master retir'd to  France  he went after him and sub∣mitted to his Fortune and lived there in Retirement about twenty Years during which Time he had  Opportunity to compose the follow∣ing Essays which were the Result of his own Experience  He had been a diligent Observer of Mankind through a long Series of Time having lived to an Hun∣dred and one had the Experience of Courts the Conversation of Men of the first Quality Generals and Men of Polite Learning And having had great Variety of Fortune himself was best able to inform Mankind what is proper to be done in those several Parts of Life in which he had been exercised  He looked back upon Life after many Years enjoying it with a truer View than Men usually do forward for we look through a magnifying Glass at Things to come and think them much bigger and more ex∣cellent than in Truth we find them The Prospect of  Canaan  from Mount  Nebo  was more ravishing even to  Moses  than the Enjoyment of it  was afterwards to the  Israelites  or would have been to himself  Solo∣mon  could not have spoke so feeling∣ly of the Vanity of the Pleasures of this Life had he not taken a full Draught of them The Freedom of the Author's Conversation in his younger Years being a Man of a warm Temper a great deal of Wit and Generosity having kept what we call the best Company gave him an Opportunity of looking back on the Miscarriages which young Gentlemen are subject to with useful Reflections and Remarks and of speaking more justly of those Errors than Closet Moralists usually do  The Author would have sent me the following Essays to have pub∣lished in his LifeTime had not the War between  England  and  France  hinder'd it but dying before that ended he gave Directions to his La∣dy to send them to me by the first  Opportunity which she accordingly did being all of his own Hand Wri∣ting  So much for the Author  As to the Essays themselves  I Essay of Company and Conver∣sation  That of Company and Conversa∣tion shews him to have read Man∣kind very throughly  The Caution of chusing ones Com∣pany when to speak and when not when to break a Jest and when not is very fit for all young Gentlemen to know his short but smart Re∣flection on obscene Discourses is a Proof of his Knowledge of the Go∣vernment of the Tongue  He Inveighs against the Sin of scoffing at Religion and profane Swearing with great Sharpness and a moving Sorrow When a good Man hears his Friend traduc'd he defends him if he has Opportunity or is in Pain for want of it Much more should every Christian be con∣cerned when he hears that Name  prophaned which ought not to be mentioned without Reverence  Nor does Detraction and Flattery escape a just Censure tho' he lived and dy'd in a Court  His Rules of Conversation with Superiors Equals and Inferiors are well weighed and consider'd As most Men are free and open at Meals the Account he gives of his Witty Master King  Charles  the Second at his private Suppers with some se∣lect Persons Men of Wit is very entertaining  One General Rule he lays down that should go through all the Parts of Conversation and that is Integri∣ty which is a Virtue too seldom pra∣ctised He avoids the Pedantry and Motoseness of severe  Cynicks  and tho' he highly commends pleasant Con∣versation Wit Musick and diver∣ting Tales yet he wisely cautions a∣gainst Picquant Jests which often breed Quarrels and in all these  Freedoms has let nothing slip from him that is contrary to the Rules of good  Ethicks  Mirth thus guarded with Inno∣cence makes the Cup of Life go down pleasantly and leaves no Stain behind it to wound the Conscience He has truly said that some Persons and Cases are privileg'd from Jests As Mens Deformity Meanness of In∣tellectuals Poverty  c  which puts me in Mind of a Gentleman whose Wit lay only in ridiculing o∣thers and having a poor Man that work'd for him whose Shape was not deformed would be often tell∣ing him he would give him five Pounds to sit for his Picture The Man thought 'twas in Derision would never be brought to it but gave him this sharp Answer  That he would give five Pounds to laugh at a poor Man but would not give him a Shilling to buy him a Dinner  Which Gentleman tho' he had then about two thousand Pounds a Year yet afterwards lived to want a Shilling to buy himself a Dinner  His Account of Conversation with well chosen Friends is very delight∣ful and instructive I know nothing of this World comparable to the Plea∣sures of Conversation with wise ho∣nest and ingenious Friends except in the Consciousness of doing our Du∣ty to the most High and the Rela∣tions we stand in and the Peace of Mind I had almost said Rapture that results from thence  His Advice to Women as to their Conversation with Men is fit for all Ladies to know and so it is for Men that intend Chastity not to be too Conversant with pretty Wo∣men for 'tis ill making GunPow∣der in a Smith's Shop  II Essay of Solitariness and Retire∣ment  His Thoughts of Retirement are very philosophical just and of great Weight and the prudent and cau∣tionary  Rules he gives therein of great Use He writes very feeling∣ly on that Subject as what he found by Experience the Art of Conver∣sation and the Art of Retirement seem to comprehend the whole Scene of humane Life of both which he appears to have been a perfect Ma∣ster and to have given proper Di∣rections in each State and Condition of Life he allows the Vigour of Life to be spent in publick Ser∣vices and the Remainder in Retire∣ment and useful Reflections for the Benefit of Mankind If he has car∣ry'd Retirement to greater Heights than Men attached to the World can allow it should be consider'd that when one is writing on a Pleasure at a time when one enjoys it it's hard to keep within the Bounds of moderate Expressions His lofty Strains nevertheless tho' true may not appear so to them who stand at a Distance and have no Taste there∣of  To speak freely of this Matter I think these Rules touching Retire∣ment should be observed  First  To have such a competent Fortune as may answer all the Cir∣cumstances of Life when the Pro∣fits of Employment are quitted For to be pinched in the Materials of Life in old Age is a miserable State especially to a generous Mind  Secondly  To have the Mind fur∣nished with such Knowledge while the Life was active as may suffici∣ently employ it when contemplative  Thirdly  To have ones Passions de∣tached from the World and to have little or no Thirst after it  Fourthly  To consecrate the latter Part of Life to the more intense Ser∣vice of God in Contemplation and Devotion and in Benefactions to the Necessitous and to endeavour to produce some Fruit for the good of the Publick for the present and fu∣ture Age  More particularly I think that a Retirement to a convenient House and pleasant Gardens near a Church where daily Devotions may be had a good Library a near Friend and the Exercise of Philosophical Experi∣ments with Beneficence to the Nee∣dy is the safest and best Retirement for a wise Man These Things will fill up the Space of Life with Inno∣cence and Pleasure  III Of St  Mary Mag∣dalen  's Life and Con∣version with some Reflections on the Con∣version of the good Thief  As for the Essay of  Mary Magda∣len  's Life and Conversion and of the Conversion of the penitent Thief he has made many curious Observations thereon with very useful Reflections In the Author's Discourse on this Subject he hath rather play'd the Prelate than the Gentleman and having read the Fa∣thers hereon has been a little taint∣ed with their Gingle  He has drawn it out to a Length with so strong a Fancy and Inventi∣on that one would rather have thought  to have been a Man of Thirty than Ninety when he wrote it In the winding up however of that Essay his Exhortations to the Love of our Sa∣viour and Contempt of the World have great Force and Energy  IV Essay of the Life and Con∣version of St  Paul  It's a hard Matter for a Man that writes on a Divine Subject and who consults what the Fathers have said thereon not to run into their Stile and conform to their way of Ex∣pression And thus the Author has done in this as well as in the pre∣ceding Essay yet his Remarks on the  Jewish  Customs of the Manner of their Education of their Youth what  Josephus  says of the sower Di∣sposition of the  Pharisees  of which Sect  Paul  was a Member of his wonder∣ful Conversion and indefatigable La∣bour in the Ministry are worthy of Observation  The Truth is the wonderful E∣vent of spreading the Gospel by Means so very improbable and in  humane Appearance so unlikely doth manifestly shew the Hand of God assisted therein  V Essay of Nobility  He has truly distinguish'd Nobi∣lity into four Parts The Beginner Advancer Continuer and Ruiner of Families and has set forth the Duty of a Nobleman and the Grace∣fulness of it when joined to Virtue in a very agreeable Manner The gaining Honour by Military Perfor∣mances he holds much preferable to what is obtain'd by Commerce when the Soldier and the Scholar meet together they make a great General witness  Zenophon  and  Caesar  amongst the Ancients and Sir  Wal∣ter Raleigh  and General  Stanhope  now Secretary of State amongst the Modern Yet I cannot but say that when that late War between  England  and  France  shall be writ by a good Hand the Duke of  Marlborough  will shine as bright in our  English  Annals as any General either ancient or mo∣dern  The  Scotch  have a good Proverb  That an Ounce of Mother's Wit is better than a Pound of Clergy  By Clergy they mean Learning  VI Essay of Content∣ment  His Essay of Contentment under adverse Fortune and the many no∣ble Examples he brings of great Men in Adversity and the weighty Reasons he gives for a quiet Submission to the divine Providence in Afflicti∣on are so genuine and natural that one may easily see they flow from a Mind exercised by long Trial in that Condition The afflicted of any sort may here draw Waters of Consolati∣on to give Peace and Rest to their Minds  His Arguments for Contentment under Afflictions are very apt to soften the Passions and allay the Fury which Men generally exercise under that State and reduce the Mind to a wise and sober Resigna∣tion to the Will of God He has writ in none of his Essays any thing  above the Nature of a brave and a good Man and particularly on this Subject he seems rather to have vented the Dictates of his own Mind under the various States of Life through which he had pass'd than offer at Conjectures which he never felt He that sets a Pattern above humane Life may please the Fancy but will never satisfie the Judgment of the Reader In giving Rules for the Conduct of humane Life in the various Events of it we should rather write like Divines and Philo∣sophers than Poets His Definition of Good and Evil is more instru∣ctive than that of  Zeno  or any of the Stoicks for he calls that Good which makes a Man the better and that Evil which makes one the worse be that Condition rich or poor great or low easie or painful  VII Essay of Women  His Description of Ladies shews his Observations of them to be very accurate they are beholden to him  for he has said very few things of them I would give them this Cau∣tion not to be too free with young Gentlemen for they who will in∣dulge to the extream Bounds of Vir∣tue will easily slip within the Pale of Vice So thin a Partition so easie a Transition there is between the one and the other The Flie that buzzes about the Candle often ge∣nerally has her Wings burnt at last The Person that would avoid burn∣ing of Shins must sit at some Di∣stance from the Fire When Nature is raised by Fooleries Virtue slips out of the Room  VIII Essay as the Know∣ledge of God and against Atheism  His Description of the Vanity of Arts and Sciences without the Know∣ledge of God is a Truth selfevident For all the Knowledge of this World is calculated only for the Meridian of this Life and reaches no farther but the Knowledge of God reaches to Eternity And as Travellers re∣turning to their own Country give  a pleasant Relation of things curious which they have met with in Foreign Parts so the Knowledge we acquire and Observations we make of God's moral Government of this World of the Revolution of States and King∣doms and of the natural Production of his admirable Works may serve us to entertain even Angels in the Kingdom of Heaven For tho' An∣gels excel us in Wisdom Power and the Knowledge of some things yet their Wisdom Power and Know∣ledge are circumscribed for none of these Qualities are infinite but in God they are ignorant of some Things Omniscience is the Attribute only of the most High The Re∣demption of Man in its full Latitude they did not know Holy Writ tells us that Angels were desirous to look into it and that they were inform'd of it by the Church But be that o∣therwise By the Study and Know∣ledge of the divine Operations of God's natural Government of the  World we arrive at the Knowledge of God himself for his Majesty is known by his Works the Contem∣plation of which brings infinite Plea∣sure to them who delight therein  As for Atheism holy Writ tells us 'twas the Fool  that said in his Heart there was no God  And indeed no∣thing but a Fool could have thought or said so and he had only the Fol∣ly of saying it in his Heart but not the Impudence to express in it Words Surely as he that sees a fine House must conclude an ingenious Artist contrived it and some Person must build it for that Stones and Tim∣ber cannot erect themselves into a regular Building without some skil∣ful Builder so he that looks on the Frame of this World must acknow∣ledge an infinite wise God that made and governs it The Belief of which to a virtuous Man is a mighty Sup∣port in the Day of Trouble  IX Essay of Religion  He has set in a true Light the Ad∣vantages of Religion to Communi∣ties  in general and to private Per∣sons in particular sufficient to recom∣mend it to the Practice of the World His Complaint of the Ig∣norance of Christians with respect to their Religion and that they take up their Religion as they do the Fa∣shion of their Cloaths according to the Custom of the Country where they live hath been true 'till of late Years even in this Reform'd Coun∣try but the Charity Schools that have been erected and dispersed through all the Parts of this King∣dom by charitable Persons and Books of Instruction given away by them hath dispelled the gross Ignorance of the common People so that now they can give a better Account of their Religion than People of a better E∣ducation in Popish Countries where the Darkness still continues and must do so where the reading the Bible is deny'd the People and Ignorance held to be the Mother of Devotion  X Essay on Kings and Princes and the Educa∣tion of a Prince  His Essay of Princes and their E∣ducation hath such masterly Stroaks in it that I could wish for the Good of Mankind that all young Princes would read and consider the same and put the excellent Advice therein given into Practice the Good and Peace of the World so much depending on the virtuous and wise Disposition of the Princes thereof The mighty Talents which God hath intrusted them with will make up a vast Account for them to answer at the tremendous Day of Judgment which they should often think of and that would make them better than they generally are  The Offences they often give are so great and many and of so uni∣versal a Nature and the Miseries brought on Mankind thereby so ge∣neral that should they read and con∣sider the Woe denounced by our Sa∣viour against those who give Of∣fence it would make the stoutest hearted Prince in Christendom trem∣ble  Witness that Prince who proud∣ly stiles himself  le Grand  who makes War upon his Neighbours  French  King's Rea∣sons for De∣claring War against the  Dutch  in  for no o∣ther apparent Reason but because he cannot dissemble his Indignation against them for pretended and sham Affronts without Diminution of his own Glory His Power to con∣quer was the true Reason Disrespect the pretended  That Prince who keeps an Army of three or four hundred thousand Men in constant Pay has so many Wolves in Hire ready to devour Mankind when∣ever he lets 'em loose and has put the rest of Christendom into a Ne∣cessity of keeping up standing Ar∣mies to prevent being surpriz'd and conquer'd by him  Even in times of Peace such Ar∣mies corrupt and debauch a whole Nation whereever they come they leave the Stains of Uncleanness be∣hind them and infect the Place by the bad Example they give What hath this Prince to answer for so ma∣ny  Millions of Offences which the Soldiery of  Europe  have given origi∣nally flowing from him  St  Austin  calls such Princes the worst of Homicides in destroying the Souls of their Subjects  And our Author tells us that Kings are not to be esteemed happy by their Conquests but by using their Power in advancing God's Honour and Service which will tend to the good of their People  XI Essay of Man  Tho' the Author has set forth the Prones of Man to do Evil yet he hath told us the Cure is in our own Power he meddles not with the Theological Points whether we can do Works of our selves wor∣thy of the divine Acceptance  ex Congruitate  or  ex Condignitate  He speaks in this Essay rather like a Mo∣ralist than Divine yet does very well shew us the Folly of running the Hazard of an Eternity of Misery for a few Moments of sensual Plea∣sure  I am entirely satisfy'd that it is more easie to mortifie an unlawful Desire by Thought and Considerati∣on joined with Addresses for the divine Assistance than to sate it by Enjoyment He that would quench an impure Desire by Enjoyment is like him that would throw Gun∣powder into the Fire to extinguish it Enjoyment stops the Current for the present but the next Tide of Blood fir'd from the Imagination of the last Enjoyment makes it boil over into a more impetuous Torrent In a Word Man is the worst or best of Creatures on this side Heaven  He that gives way to his sensitive Appetite and indulges therein is worse than a Brute for Brutes have some natural Checks or Instinct that confine and restrain their Sensations within moderate Bounds but a  De∣bauchee  lets loose all his five Faculties to an universal Indulgence even far∣ther than Nature will afford him Strength On the contrary the  good Man who makes Reason his Pilot and Revelation his Pole Star sails through the stormy Billows of this World with Peace and Content∣ment and having  Mens consciarecti  does in a manner anticipate the Joys of Heaven by fixing his Treasure there before hand and by a strong Imagination of what is to come tastes them in this present Life  XII Essay of Greatness of Mind  There are abundance of Examples both ancient and modern of great Men that have sacrificed their Lives for the good of their Country  Dulce est per Patria mori  is an old Adage Fame and the Hope of immortal Glory have carry'd Men on to very desperate Attempts and Things that at first View have seemed impra∣cticable to the Cautious and wary have nevertheless by bold and reso∣lute Men been carry'd with Success  He that sets no Value on his own Life hath generally the Life of any  other Man in his Power But I think true Greatness of Mind rather con∣sists in conquering one's self than the World  Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima Vincit  A Man of a wildfire Spirit may roam about the World with a Parcel of Soldiers at his Heels and burn and consume half the Univers which in the modern Language we call a Man of Valour great General invincible al∣ways victorious  c  and yet be the worst of Men the worst of Friends and all the while he is doing of Mischief may be gratifying a wicked Passion may wish with the Tyrant that all Mankind had but one Neck that he might cut it off at one Blow But he that considers the State and Con∣dition of Life he is placed in here that he hath a Body that hath Ap∣petites and Desires strong and vigo∣rous towards sensual Objects and to enjoy them in a prohibited De∣gree and that he hath a rational Na∣ture that should steer and govern  his sensitive Faculties and bring them to act within Bounds that there is a reveal'd divine Law that commands him to lead a holy Life on which Considerations he sacrifices the De∣sires of the Body to the Divine Pre∣cepts and suffers Afflictions with Re∣signation to that Hand from whence they come this Man in my Opinion is greater than  Caesar  or  Pompey Job  had more passive Valour than  Alex∣ander  the Great But we have  Ro∣man  Examples of meer Heathens that refus'd the Riches and Honours of the World and retired to an obscure and private Life witness  Quintus Cin∣cinnatus  who was ploughing at his little Farm when the Senate of  Rome  sent to him to come and appease the Sedition in the City which when he had so done he return'd back to his Farm again and would accept no Reward Soon after he was sent to again to head the  Romans  against a foreign Enemy that invaded their Country he went and was made  Dictator beat the Enemy rescued his Country laid down the  Fasces  re∣fus'd the Lands and Treasure offer'd him for his good Services being con∣tented with the Reward only which Virtue brings with it  i e  the Pleasure of a good Conscience which results from doing one's Duty and return'd back to his petty Farm  XIII Essay of Children  We take a great deal of Care in our Breed of Horses and some are so curious to do the like in their Dogs while at the same time there is an universal Negligence in the Choice of Wives the greatness of the Portion being the chief Thing aimed at whereas a good Under∣standing should be principally desired A silly Woman especially if she be of a low and mean Spirit generally bringing foolish or sheepish Children There is no less Carelessness in the E∣ducation of Children in their tender Years What People attend them Foolish Nurses and weak Women being generally the first Persons they  converse with after they are able to talk What Idle Impressions and sil∣ly Ideas must such Children have that are thus accosted as soon as their Fa∣culties are able to receive any Impressi∣on The idle Tales of such Women who frighten Children from crying by Stories of HobGoblins Spirits and such Fooleries have made them when of an adult Age afraid of being in the Dark and of something they know not what They teach them Pride and to value themselves upon their Cloaths by asking and shewing them where they are fine which Folly accompanies the Female Sex usually to their Grave nor are foppish Men free from that Vanity  They teach them Revenge and Folly at the same time by pretending to beat another by a Blow or Pat from the Hand of the Child  They teach them lying and Folly by telling Miss 'twas not she that cry'd but one behind the Curtain Thus taught comes the abused Infant on the Stage of the World whereas the most di∣screet  and prudent People should be at∣tendant on Children to make proper Impressions upon them at first for these stick longest with them as for the more riper Years the Author hath spoke so fully that I shall add no more  XIV Essay of Law  The Benefit of Laws and living by Rules are so evident to every Under∣standing that there needs but little to be said in Commendation thereof  There is scarce any Nation under Heaven however despotick and abso∣lute the Prince is but yet has some cer∣tain Rule or Law for the general Con∣duct of humane Life with respect to the Publick yet when the Prince is absolute the Subject is little better than a Slave Law being but a Cobweb to him which he can easily break thro' whenever he pleases That the People conform their Lives after the Example of the Prince and chief Magistrate where they reside the Author hath ve∣ry justly observed which ought to be a Lesson to all Princes and Magistrates to act with great Caution that their bad  Example may not lead the common People or those of a common Under∣standing into Vices  Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis  And here I can∣not but say a Word of the Benefit of our  English  Laws which both Foreigners that live here and Natives have great Reason to be thankful to Providence for The Laws of  England  secure every Man's Property and Liberty no Man forfeits either but by the Transgression of some known positive Law The Magistrate cannot commit any Sub∣ject to Prison without a Breach of the Laws if he does he is answerable for it to the Party injured The Judge de∣termines not according to Arbitrary Power but according to known and stated Rules But this Subject hath been so much spoken of that I think it not necessary to say any more thereon  XV Essay of old Age  As no Man writes more feelingly of Afflictions than he who gives his Thoughts a Vent under that Conditi∣on so no Man can write so truly of the Circumstances of old Age as he  that keeps his Understanding well to an hundred the which the Author did as appears by his Essays some of which were writ at near that Age  The Respect he challenges as due to old Age especially when furnish'd with Wisdom and Knowledge and the Consideration of good Services done to the Publick is a Tribute that I think ought not to be deny'd it But nothing can make the Mind of an old Man more calm and sedate more bright and shining than a Retrospect of a long Life well spent in a zealous promoting the Honour of God and the Good and Welfare of Mankind for every Man's Life is to be estimated by its Usefulness Integrity of Mind a love of Truth in the Soul and the Consciousness of do∣ing all we can for our most munificent Benefactor to whom we are riding post in old Age makes that Scene of Life full of Joy and Pleasure St  Paul  was full of Rapture when he was going off the Stage of Life tho' by a violent Death But few Courtiers come within  this Character for to them generally Falshood and Deceit are as natural as bowing and cringing and as for Truth it hath no Place in their Souls They join themselves to a Party that they may mount up to be the Head of it with no other View but to betray and destroy it and to aggrandize themselves thereby Oh blessed Sincerity oh hap∣py Integrity But this wicked State of Life is as ancient as  Seneca  the Trage∣dian witness these Lines  Colit hic Reges calcet ut omnes  Perdatque aliquos nullumque levet  Tantum ut noceat cupit esse potens  Whitlock Bulstrode  ERRATA  PAge Line for  utjust  read  unjust

ESSAYS ON Various Subjects  Of Company and Conversation  W  HEN God created  Adam  who the first Moment was a perfect Man yet he was not made to be entirely de∣tached and to live inde∣pendant of his Kind for tho' he had nothing in Prospect but Plenty Pleasure Innocence and Secu∣rity and by the Dignity of his Nature was set above the Society of meer Ani∣mals yet God saw his Being imperfect without a Helper and that his Happi∣ness  was not compleat whilst he remain'd Solitary wherefore God miraculously reliev'd him by dividing him to unite him and made one Part of him a Com∣panion for the other to maintain his Reason with a more equal Converse for which End God ordain'd Speech from whence we derive all the Advan∣tages of Society and without which Men would have been useless to each other For by this we possess the most valuable worldly Blessings Friendship and Society which are esteem'd amongst the Pleasures of the first Magnitude the Comfort of Life depending upon Con∣versation Humane Society being like the working of a ArchStone where all would fall to the Ground if one Peice did not sustain another and yet Com∣pany is so dangerous and Speech so lia∣ble to be deprav'd that what was inten∣ded for our Advantage is become the Source of all our Misfortunes For Ori∣ginal Sin came first out of the Mouth by Speaking before it entred hers by Eat∣ing and therefore the due Management of that Member may justly be reputed one of the greatest Mysteries of Wisdom and Virtue since we find to our Sorrow the first Use  Eve  made of her Tongue was to talk with the Tempter and from  that Discourse to tempt  Adam  who was no sooner fallen but he makes a frivo∣lous Excuse less able to cover his Sin than the FigLeaves his Nakedness And this Viciousness of the Tongue hath de∣scended from the Infancy of the World even to this Day for amongst our great∣est Depravations there are none more Notorious than that of Speech For we do not only fall by the Slipperiness of our Tongues but we deliberately train them to Mischief and what was first intended for the Benefit of Humane Society is now become the great Disturber of it we living in an Age wherein we count it a part of our Birthright to let loose our Tongues and to use the Spur where we should hold the Bridle whereby Conversation is generally Corrupted and he that Converses has almost as ma∣ny Snares as Companions there being scarce any single Man but by his Dis∣course Example or Behaviour does recommend to us or imprint in us or by a kind of Contagion insensibly infect us with some Vice or other so that Conversation which was intended to cultivate our Minds and civilize the World hath turn'd it almost to a Wil∣derness Upon this Account some Men will take a Pett at Mankind and walk  into the Desarts to avoid Company when it is more prudential to stand their Ground and to fence against the In∣conveniencies that may happen and if they fear bad Company they should keep close to Men of Virtue and stand care∣fully upon their Guard it being more reasonable to be conversable for the sake of the Good than to fly from every Mortal for fear of meeting with bad People If every Man were possest with this Shiness not only States and King∣doms but even Humane Nature would be destroy'd for to what end was Speech given to Man if it were not for Enter∣tainment of each other And must we quit our Station and turn Savage by our selves and suffer no Company for fear of Bad This is to take Things by the wrong Handle for nothing but our own Miscarriages ought to affect us and not those of other People  'Tis certain that all Mens Bodies are naturally of the same Clay the difference of Education only is the Pot∣ter's Hand that forms them into Ves∣sels of Honour or Dishonour there being no humane Means more effectual towards ripening and sharpning Mens Intellects giving them an edge and quickness for Conversation than good  Education because it takes them in that Age wherein their Faculties are as their Joints pliable and tractable and so capable of being by Exercise impro∣ved into great Degrees of Strength Activity and Ability So that one of the greatest Blessings which Man can receive at God's Hands is the favoura∣ble Blessing of good Education which polishes and purifies Nature as one would do a precious Stone wholly defiled with Earth and this makes Men become like Angels when without it the best Na∣tures would still dwell in Brutishness Now since after good Education it is a great Part of Wisdom as well as Breed∣ing to learn what is convenient and to take the true height of our Acquain∣tance who conversing with our Minds cast upon them either Graces or Defor∣mities It will therefore be highly ne∣cessary for young Gentlemen who are tender of their Honour and Credit to be more than ordinarily careful of being too venturous of any Company and to be very curious in taking an exact Survey with what Persons they may safely and decently Converse and how they ought to Behave themselves therein  It is usual with Physicians in infectious Times to forbid most strictly the smal∣ler Excesses and Exorbitances of Diet as apt to breed any Distemper because every small Accident of that Kind thro' the Malignity of the Air is then likely to turn into the Plague So now that Atheism and Profaneness are rife in the World and spread much and Debau∣chery is so predominant and contagious that we daily see many Men of virtuous Dispositions and good Inclinations which would have grown to Abilities to be by ill Company most perniciously Corrupted some Cautions herein seem therefore highly necessary For as if we Breath in an infectious Air we shall suck in Diseases so if we live in bad Company we shall soon add to their Number and learn their Vices and Im∣perfections  There is nothing more dangerous for young Gentlemen than to mistake them∣selves in the Choice of their Company This is a Point of such Importance that upon it depends the whole Course of their Lives and Manners the frequen∣ting with wicked Men brings us acquain∣ted with Vice makes us behold it with∣out Emotion by Degrees we begin to act it with some Pleasure and Time breeds in us a Habit  Principiis obsta serò Medicina paratur  Cum mala per longas invaluere moras  St  Augustin  well expresses the Danger of this saying  "It is a Nail driven in∣to a Post with a Hammer which after the first and second Stroak may be drawn out with little Difficulty but being once driven up to the Head the Pincers can take no hold to draw it out which cannot be done but by Destruction of the Wood  He that lives in this great Theatre of the World should in the first Place learn how to suit himself into sundry Habits that he may be inabled in this Comedy to represent many Persons no Man be∣ing fit to appear upon this Stage till he knows how to Act his Part to the Life and therefore he must labour to have his Mind made pliable which may stoop and rise according to the several Con∣ditions and Capacities of Men he asso∣ciates with not fearing to speak to the Greatest with due Observance nor dis∣daining to converse familiarly with the Meanest respecting Goodness where∣ever he sees it which he shall as often find under a Russet Coat as under a  Velvet Cassock and with Moral honest Men as soon as with the more Learned for Conversation hath made very accom∣plish'd Persons without the Assistance of Learning the World being a great Book which instructs continually Conversa∣tions are living Libraries not at all in∣ferior to Books Good Conferences are like Flints which from a cold and dark Heap produce Heat and Light if Men strike them one against the other and the familiar Discourses of two or three good Wits may be more advan∣tageous to us than the empty Dispu∣tations of many Pedants together and they vent more in one Hour than we shall read all Day in a Library  There is nothing that puts better Thoughts in a Man than a good Com∣panion for Example hath the force of Precept and touches the Heart with an Affection to Goodness and not only the frequent hearing but the very seeing of a Wise Man delights us  The best Rule herein is to associate with those who may be the better for us and we for them these Respects are mutual for while we teach we learn It is not Safe to trust our selves with much Company whosoever goes much abroad he scarce comes home the same  Man he went out something or other discomposes him for it is with our Minds as it is after a long Indisposition with our Bodies we are grown so ten∣der that the least Breath of Air exposes us to a Relapse  There is certainly much Pleasure and Satisfaction in communicating our Thoughts and in the Intercourses of Friendship well chosen and therefore  Seneca  said  If Knowledge and Wisdom were offered him on the Terms of a Se∣cret and that he must not speak of it he would positively refuse the Present  And  Tully  in his  Offices  tells us  If a Person had all the Blessings of this Life yet if he was kept from all Company and ne∣ver to see or converse with Men he had much rather Die than Live in such Con∣dition  Now the first Step to Conversation is our outward Carriage and Comport∣ment wherein the less we are constrain'd our Actions and Thoughts seem there∣by more Innocent The Differences of Men are easily read in their Behaviour and a short Observation of that will often tell us as much as a long Confe∣rence Some Mens Carriage is like a Verse where every Syllable is measur'd but where there is so much Care about the  Outside there is commonly a Remisness in what belongs to the Mind it being as rare to see starched complimental Man Wise as to see a Woman Valiant There is a sort of Men who have an earnest Application to make every thing sit right about them which strikes too deep into their small Stock of Thoughts to allow it Furniture for any thing else and therefore to do right to these fine∣spun Gentlemen Conversation is too course a Thing for them and it's best to leave them to their Taylor with whom they will live in better Cor∣respondence than with any other Com∣pany Indeed a good Presence and handsome Mein sorted with Valour and Wisdom does a Man excellent Service if he spoils it not with Affe∣ctation and carries with it as Queen  Elizabeth  us'd to say  Letters or Re∣commendation  and if I am rightly in∣form'd this was the only Thing that brought the great Duke of  Buckingham  into Favour with King  James  I by see∣ing him at a Masque in Court Cer∣tainly if our outward Comportment be good the adorning the Mind does dou∣ble that Excellency if ill it will make it good when the Mind performs what the Body promises not Our Behaviour  should be like a wellmade Suit of Cloaths more proper than gaudy more fit than fine In our outward Carriage all manner of Affectation is unseemly there being nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a native Freedom there∣in a Gracefulness of Behaviour setting off much when it is not constrain'd Dancing is good and adds Grace to a Man when he well performs it but a Man must not set himself to it as if he made it his Trade Dancing makes the Body free and not so stiff but to move gracefully and a Man's Skill is therein perceiv'd tho' he stands still But who∣ever intends to make it his Masterpeice one may call it excelling in a Mistake which is  no good Commendation  as a late great Lord said It is a great Advan∣tage to be a good Actor for Action is a kind of Expression and Words well chosen are agreeable when they express Things that please so all that is ex∣pressed by the Face and Body is well re∣ceiv'd when done with a good Grace But we must not here mistake For there are those that are sometimes Actors of Nothing as well as those that are Speakers of Nothing The Action and Air of the Countenance have certain Charms which have a great Influence  on our Minds An Oration spoken by a good Orator appears great and lofty tho' penn'd in common Terms and compounded of ordinary Conceptions and many Preachers have in their Pul∣pits charm'd their Auditors whose Ser∣mons in Print were scarce worth Read∣ing I have heard Verses recited in a good Tone which have been admir'd which being read by another their Esteem was much diminish'd and it's probable the Reason of this Alteration proceeded from the Harmony which was then wanting We should not look upon this as strange of good Orations and agreeable Conferences if we call to mind that of Musical Instruments touch∣ed by the Hands of an exquisite Master there are some Tones which inspire Sad∣ness and sweetly incline our Souls to Languish and there are Airs which Re∣joyce and make our Hearts Merry and pleasingly compel our Feet to Dance their Time  In Conversation it is not enough to have Wit but he must be an extream wellbred Man to know how to be plea∣sant in Conversation amongst Persons that know how to Judge because most Men have not a delicate Taste nor are able to discern what is best and it often  happens that such Persons are taken nay even charm'd with certain ridiculous Parts they play to them but tho' these Fooleries are current amongst some yet wellbred Persons do not love such kind of Buffoonry and those that use them are rather the Subjects of Scorn than Laugh∣ter to those that rightly understand Such are halfwitted Men who have a tinsel Wit which shines amongst those who cannot Judge Petty Merchants of small Conceits who have an empty Ha∣bit of Prating without Meaning they always aim at Wit but generally make false Fire  'Tis true we cannot shew too much Wit in pleasant Conversation yet a Man must have a great Care not to shew himself too forward as if one would appear ready to make Jests and speak fine Things There is something of a free way which cannot be well expressed which hath a much better Effect but yet it is not good to be too Reserv'd nor affect Singularity an open and com∣plaisant Carriage hath very great Charms to attract Love However what Ad∣vantage soever any one hath he must be pleas'd with others if he would have others pleas'd with him And if we like not our Company let us withdraw from  them but whilst we are in Company we should carry our selves so that we should be acceptable to those with whom we Converse tho' we have no Kindness for them As for those who think to Revenge themselves by a cross Carriage they do themselves more Injury than they do to others The Love of Socie∣ty is Natural but the Choice of our Company is Matter of Prudence and the Conscience of giving good Example is one of the greatest Obligations any Man can lay upon the Age he lives in  It is indeed a fair Step towards Hap∣piness and Virtue to delight in the Conversation of good and wise Men and where those cannot be had it is best to keep no Company at all When Men are Good and Virtuous they are as good alone as in Company but most Men are of themselves the worst Com∣pany they can keep let such therefore Converse with others and avoid them∣selves but he that cannot secure him∣self in Privacy shall be much more ex∣pos'd in Publick Many a Ship is lost in the Harbour but more in the Ocean There are some Persons whose Compa∣ny we cannot too much frequent 'tis certain by seeing them often besides the Improvement we have by being with  them we gain a good Esteem to our selves as we Perfume our selves un∣awares by walking amongst the Jessamins and Orange Trees Witty Men who are wellbred always say something that pleases and seldom do any thing which hath not some Mark of Worth and Breeding and by conversing with and observing them we may not only in∣form our selves of such Things as are necessary to be known for the making an accomplish'd Man but we also learn how to apply them and likewise so far as to know when 'tis proper and man∣nerly to be Silent But we must know how to distinguish for we shall often hear very good Things come from Men who behave themselves with as much Becomingness as can be disired yet many times this is but borrow'd Lan∣guage and the Actings of a Part and therefore we must not regard so much that which appears Polite and Regular as we do certain other Things which shew whether there be a Foundation and that the Understanding goes farther and is of larger Extent  We find in some Men a certain Plau∣sibleness of Carriage which pleases in young People but yet passes away like a Flower or a Dream and we shall often  see these Men become the Neglect and Scorn of those who once admir'd them but a wellbred Man hath more solid Virtues tho' he be less busie and for∣ward to shew himself in the World and if we love a Man for his good Breeding and Honesty we shall always love him Yet it is not enough to have a fair Out∣side to make a Man agreeable that which is of greatest Importance is the Will regulating our Intellectuals and taking Care that our Head and our Heart be in good Order for no Man can ever be Excellent without having a good Heart and much Wit  An accomplish'd Person tho' of ne∣ver so much Wit ought not to be too Confident of himself for the more he Excels the more Care he ought to take not to Prescribe to the Company for naturally every Man is afraid of a Master Wit and Men do not love to be he∣ctor'd out of their Opinions it being esteem'd the common Birthright of Mankind that every Man to opine and judge according to the Dictates of his own Understanding and not of another's and therefore a Magisterialness in Opi∣nion is very unbefitting Men in Conver∣sation for it does not only fasten upon our Nature but upon the better Part of  it our Reason Freedom is the endea∣ring Thing in Society and where that is controlled Men are not very fond of Associating themselves 'Tis Natural for us to be uneasie in the Presence of those that assume an Authority over us as Children care not for the Company of their Parents or Tutors that govern them And Men will care less for theirs who would make them Children by usurping a Tutorage over them This Perem∣ptoriness in Conversation renders Wise Men disobliging and very troublesome and Fools ridiculous and contemptible we seeing none so peremptory as half∣witted People who have just enough to excite their Pride but not so much as to cure their Ignorance This is the Effect of a mean and imprudent Educa∣tion a Man who hath converst only with the lower Sort of Company who durst not dispute nor examine his Asser∣tions thinks the same false Coin will pass over the World which went cur∣rant amongst his Petty Comerades And we may observe this Fault is most usual amongst young Men who have come raw into Company with good Fortunes and ill Breeding And there∣fore those Persons are most to be esteem∣ed who shew their Wit without offen∣ding  any one and such are usually ha∣ted who make use of Wit only to the displeasing of others and a Wise Man ought to avoid the Company of such it being a small Advantage to have Wit if we do not make use of it for gaining the good Opinion and Love of the World We ought to deal with others with that Patience Respect and Mo∣deration which we expect from them not setting forth our own Opinions im∣periously nor rejecting the Opinion of others arrogantly remembring that we are all enwrapped in a deep Mist and that all our Reasoning is but groping in the Dark and therefore we should pass gently over the Errors of our Neigh∣bours to oblige them to the like Ac∣count But many Gentlemen are so far from this generous Humour that they always behave themselves disdainfully in Company as if they could not set a just Value upon themselves without the ut∣just Contempt of others But this Pride is commonly a Wind that blows only one Way down Hill upon those below him upwards they breath gentler Gales it being one of their most studied Fa∣culties to perform all Acts of the high∣est supererrogating Civility to those above them Now there is nothing that  makes a Man more distasteful to Com∣pany than this haughty Humour it being not only Pride but Inhumanity to attribute so much to the Prerogative of Birth as not to shew Affability and Respect to the Meanest  The Conversation of those who are bred in Armies is not commonly very pleasing but in Recompence they are said to be Men of Honour and Repu∣tation as if that would excuse their Wants in every Thing else when there is nothing so disgusting as to be dis∣agreeable and morose in Company This is like certain Women that pretend to Virtue who value themselves much up∣on their being Coy and Fierce which makes Men think all is counterfeit and affected and that they are easier gotten than those who observe good Manners and Breeding and are as Affable as these are Severe Such Women are like those peevish Mistresses who think they have a Licence to Kick and Scratch provided they do not Kiss as if Ladies could not be honest without being rude A con∣fident yet a modest Carriage which is neither mean nor sullen having nothing which savours not of Goodness and Ho∣nesty is that which is most esteem'd in the World and takes with every Body  Women who have most Wit like best a discreet Reservedness in Men those being usually disappointed of their Aims who throw as it were their Hearts at Ladies Heads and at the first Dash tell them more of their Love than can in any probability be true and many times more than they desire to hear  In our Conversation it is good Ad∣vice to spare and thriftily to order that which a Man knows and tho' he hath that in his Head which is better than Silence yet he ought to be more wil∣ling to hear than to speak to learn than to teach it being a great Folly to be more ready to shew all that is in us rather than to learn Knowledge of ano∣ther to spend our own Stock rather than to get new When we hear we receive when we speak we give and tho' it be more glorious to give yet it is more profitable to receive and there∣fore a just Moderation herein is best not to be overSilent nor Talkative the first shewing Stupidity or Scorn the last Giddiness of the Brain Prudent Men will therefore speak no more than to bring on Discourse and will give others their turns of Speech a Civil Guest will no more Talk all than Eat all the Feast It is a great Advantage to know  how to Speak and to Write when either smells too much of Study it pleases not the general Opinion is that Men should Write as they Speak and Speak as they Write but we seldom do either as we wish we could In order to this it were good when we Write to imagine we are Speaking that we may not put in any Thing that is not Natural or which may not be spoken in Company and when we Speak we should fancy we are Writing that we may not say any Thing that is not fitting Many People are said to Speak well who cannot Write well but I doubt there is a Mistake herein for some Men may seem to Speak well in Appearance when they do not in Effect For when a Man really excels in Speak∣ing he may do the same in Writing but this latter requires more Care and one may Write well without knowing how to Speak well for we usually see those who make it their Business to Write well have commonly a languish∣ing Way of Speaking for to Speak well is not only to make our Thoughts be understood but to express our Ap∣prehensions which are two very diffe∣rent Things and there is no greater sign that a Man well understands him∣self than to be able perspicuously to  Speak to the Understanding of another and our Discourse should always be measur'd by the Aptness of it to whom it is Addressed for unless our Speech be fitted to the Capacities of those we Dis∣course with tho' it be never so elabo∣rate it will rather Confound than Edi∣fie  Thus the best Art of Speaking shews it self under a natural Dress it is like plain natural Beauty those that are the most Perfect shew themselves least and when our Words smell of Art and Study one may conclude they that say them have but little of either or else that they know not how to make use of them This is the Fault of those that Speak so that they cannot be under∣stood but by the Learned We should therefore to our Power rather mean Wisely than speak Learnedly much less Affectedly for those whose Tongues run Proud after Words are of very lit∣tle Use but amongst such Ears as call a BagPipe Musick for their Lips open like a Purse without Money and their Tongues like a Fencer before a Pageant stir but not strike A Gentleman should talk like a Gentleman that is like a Wise Man his Knowledge ought to be general he should have a Taste of every  Thing he should not be a Slave to one Science one Knowledge is but Part of the House like a bay Window no Man will build his House so maim'd much less himself he must be Com∣pleat  All those who have given Rules for Civil Life have in order to it put very severe Restrictions upon the Tongue that it run not before the Judgment 'Twas  Zeno  's Advice to Dip the Tongue in the Mind before one should Speak and  Theophrastus  was us'd to say It was safer trusting to an unbridled Horse than to intemperate Speech and daily Experience confirms this Aphorism for those who set no Guard upon their Tongues are hurried by them into a thousand Indecencies and very often into real considerable Mischiefs and whereas Men should keep a Lock upon their Lips they give their Tongue the Key of their Heart and the Event hath been often as Unhappy as the Proceeding was Preposterous  And as our Words must be the Pro∣duct of our Judgment so they must be temperate and decent mixed with Cur∣tesie and Civility for he that hath calm∣ed his Passions hath nothing to betray them to rash and rude Language which  is a Foam cast up only by the Billows of a turbulent Mind and can never be the Issues of a serene composed Tem∣per neither does any thing Charm us more than gracious Language  Quae ne illos quidem quos damnat offendit  a pregnant Example of which was seen in the last Age at the Tryal of the Earl of  Strafford  Lord Lieutenant of  Ire∣land  in the Year where amongst others that were appointed by the House of Commons to Manage their Impeach∣ment against him there was one emi∣nent Lawyer who urged very smartly against his Lordship but yet with great Respect and Civility of Language And when the Earl came to Reply as he did to every one he said he had been very roughly handled by most of the Plea∣ders but that he was very much be∣holding to one civil Gentleman amongst them naming the former Person who tho' he had touched him nearer the Quick than any other yet he was ob∣liged to return him Thanks because he had cut his Throat with a clean Knife Thus we see good Words are afforded at the same Price as ill and are not on∣ly cheap but prevalent upon all Occa∣sions  Next to this Graciousness of Lan∣guage we should be very careful that our Speeches carry Integrity with them Candour and Ingenuity being most e∣steem'd in Discourse Those who have upright Hearts their Judgment how small soever will be still the same but those who have many Turnings and Doubles in their Heart never have a right Understanding there is always some counterfeit Light which gives them false Appearances and then their Artifices and Craft shew they have not Parts sufficient to effect their Designs by fair and honest Ways whereas the way that pleases worthy Persons is that Freedom of PlainDealing What a Gracefulness so clear a Source gives to all the Actions of our Life How it beautifies our Words and Thoughts And how pleasing a Thing it is to Speak well when so much Sincerity goes a∣long with it And tho' one may not perhaps be Happy in all Things by following this Maxim however one is sure at least to gain the Esteem and Af∣fection of those who understand true Merit nothing being so commendable in Conversation as to have an upright and sincere Heart which seems to be the Foundation of Wisdom  Speech was given to Man as the Image and Interpreter of the Soul It is  anime index speculum  the Messen∣ger of the Heart the Gate by which all that is within issues forth and comes into open Veiw And therefore the Philosopher said well to the Child  Lo∣quere ut te videam  Speak that I may see thee that is the Inside of thee for as Vessels are known whether they be broken or whole by their inward Sound so is Man from his Speech which car∣ries with it not only a great Influence but a great Discovery of our Minds and Integrity herein is the publick Faith of Mankind With all sorts of Men we should deal ingeniously yet reser∣vedly saying what we think but think∣ing more than we say it being not good to say at all Times all that the Heart think∣eth tho' all that the Heart thinketh be good Freedom of Speech is some∣times to be foreborn least we give others Power thereby to lay hold on the Rudder of our Minds for in all there are some Places weaker than others and prudent Men will take heed of ly∣ing uncover'd that Way 'Tis true there may be possibly in Discourse a Fault of Omission but this is a righthand Error a Man may be sometimes sorry he said  no more but very often that he said so much God hath given us two Ears and one Mouth that we ought to Hear more than to Speak we have no EarLids to keep us from Hear∣ing and often must Hear against our Will but our Mouth shuts naturally and we may keep our Tongue from Speaking unless by Intemperance we lose that Privilege of Nature  The Truth is our Tongue is so slip∣pery that is easily deceives a heedless Guard Nature hath given it some un∣happy Advantages towards it it being the most ready for Motion of any Mem∣ber and therefore is to be the more carefully managed the chiefest Rules to be prescribed herein are Sufficiency and Pertinency a Man should not only know what to say but what not to say for in Speech enough is better than all Words are but the Lacquies of Reason of which to send more than will per∣form the Business is superfluous and the Discretion in Speaking is not so much in Speaking few Words as in Speaking none Impertinent otherwise the Dumb were Born with great Ad∣vantage if we must retrench the Use of the Tongue instead of moderating it  A wise Man's Words must be weigh∣ty and material they are  weighed in the Balance  says the Son of  Syrach  and therefore a Gentleman's Discourse should be such as might answer that Character no Man ever attempting to put Froth and Bubbles into the Scales  When  Zeno  heard a young Man full of Talk  Aures inquit in linguam de∣fluxêre  he said His Ears were fallen into his Tongue intimating thereby that they should Hear much and Speak little The Truth is when People are very young they cannot Judge rightly of any Thing and it happens either by Experience Reflections or meeting with some intelligent Persons they come to be of another Mind and de∣spise that which they once so much ad∣mir'd and many Times laugh at them∣selves when they examine themselves without Flattery It is certain he that always Talks adventures himself too far thereby depriving himself of Observa∣tion which is the great Advantage of Society and from whence comes Expe∣rience and Wisdom Herein we should imitate cunning Shopkeepers who shew their Wares in a half Light upon Oc∣casion we should Speak but sparingly and rather Starve than Surfeit our Au∣ditors  Our Discourses must not be too florid in the beginning it is a Thing much to be wished that all which one says be good and fine according as the Subject merits but we must proceed by Degrees Nature is in this as in all other Things a very knowing Mistress con∣sider how She proceeds insensibly the fairest Day when it begins to break and appear hath so little Light that it is hardly discernable whether it be Day or Night and nothing is so great a sign that the way of Speaking is noble as when it leaves some certain Things to be apprehended without Speaking them and therefore it is good to know when to give over and to proceed to other Matters or at least we should give them another Face and Turn because Diver∣versity seems not tedious  To make our selves be heard with Pleasure we must say such Things as others will be glad to hear and say them pleasantly which is the best way to make us be belov'd besides when we please others well we are likewise better pleas'd with our selves Excellent Painters ne∣ver draw all they still allow something for you to exercise your own Imagina∣tion and always leave you more to find out than they discover The Graces ap∣pear  very rarely and even when they are seen they will not be consider'd full fac'd nor uncover'd in the same manner we should not open our selves too much and in our Discourses we should observe this as a general Rule Either to Speak fitly or to be Silent wisely for many by their Silence may pass for Wise Men whom Speech would presently discover otherwise When the Ass disguised himself in the Lyon's Skin he frighted all the Beasts and even the cunning Fox till he heard him Bray  Pro certo scias nisi rudentem audivissem te ego timuessem  Unlearned Men which seem of Ability to Strangers are quickly discover'd by their Loquacity and those that speak much in Company seldom speak well for they that well understand themselves know not how to dwell in Talk  Long Discourses  says  Plutarch like overfeather'd Arrows shoot beyond the Mark and by wearying the Attention ordinarily lose both Game and Labour Aristotle  answer'd a Man well who having held him in a long Discourse in the end begg'd his Excuse telling him he might have sav'd his Apo∣logy for he had not minded what he said And it was a smart Reply of  Theo∣critus  to an ill Poet repeating many of  his Verses and asking which he liked best answer'd  Those which he had omit∣ted  And indeed the Company of such who Talk much to little Purpose ought as little to be regarded for if a Man be vain and trifling in his Dis∣courses both he that hears and he that answers will be equal Losers of their Time And if we shut our Ears to tri∣fling Discourses much more carefully ought we to keep our Hearts from drawing in the Breath of obscene Dis∣courses which are the very Pest of Con∣versation We should herein imitate  Xenocrates  the Philosopher who being asked an obscene Question and giving no answer being again importun'd to Answer said well  De tali re te homi∣nem vanum interrogare decet me autem respondere nequaquam  Obscene Speeches like Oil falling upon Linnen will spread much and as the Poison of the Body enters by the Mouth so the Poison of the Heart enters by the Ear and there∣fore those who have Honesty in their Hearts will have only civil and modest Words in their Mouths  Next to Modesty in our Conversation we must be careful not to be too inqui∣sitive into other Men's Affairs and if we would be persuaded to affect a  wholsom Ignorance therein it would much conduce to our Ease and Inno∣cence for it is the Itch of the Ear that breaks out at the Tongue and were not Curiosity the Purveyor this Trade would soon be set aside The Boy in  Plutarch  being ask'd what he carried hid under his Cloak answer'd well  That he there∣fore carried it so that the other might not know it  An unseasonable Inquiry into Things shews a great Weakness and Folly in the Inquiror  When  Socrates  was asked by a curi∣ous Person What was done in the next World he told him  He had never been there nor spoken with any that came from thence  St  Augustin  tells us  Cu∣riosus est qui ea avidè scrutatur quae ad se non pertinent studiosus vero qui dili∣genter ea perquirit quae ad se attinent  We shall see some Men very inquisi∣tive into the Religion of their Acquain∣tance being very shy of discoursing with Men of differing Persuasions and put on an angry Zeal against them be∣lieving they are fighting God Almighty's Quarrel and therefore grow into a hardned Severity against all who dis∣sent from them And we shall frequent∣ly see Men whose Manners and Con∣ditions are very conformable in all the  necessary Obligations of Human Socie∣ty to avoid each others Company and grow unsociable to each other meerly because the one cannot think as the other does Whereas our Opinions come from our Heads our Affections from our Hearts and therefore a wise Man will no more trouble himself about his Companions Religion than about the Religion of his Physician or Lawyer The Offices of Friendship which one Man owes to another having nothing to do with that Consideration and Men do not so much question whether their Servants be Virtuous as whether they be Diligent which is the Thing for which they make use of them But yet this is a pernicious Error for Men to think themselves no otherwise concer∣ned in their Servants than they are in their Horses and Oxen to look upon them only as another Species of work∣ing Cattle and so they do their Busi∣ness care not how arrant Brutes they be Whereas Gentlemen should con∣sider that they with themselves are com∣mon Servants to one great Master and that the Subjection of one to the other is but the wise Oeconomy of their Lord who hath made the one as Stewards or Supervisors to regulate the rest and  then it will appear a great Unfaithful∣ness to neglect this Charge for tho' they receive Wages they are not below their Care Nature having made no such Di∣stinction and Returns of Kindness and good Usage are as much their Due to such of them as deserve it as their Ser∣vice is due to their Masters when they require it But leaving this Digression there are others so far from this Nice∣ness that in their Discourses they de∣spise and mock at Religion because they would not be under the Restraints of it Religion is against them and therefore they set themselves against Re∣ligion and it is observable that those who upon other Subjects their best Friends must needs acknowledge to be sufficiently dull yet can talk very wit∣tily in derogation of Religion with some kind of salt and smartness and because Religion frets them it makes them wynch and fling and gives them some kind of Wit and Sharpness in rallying against it These are Persons that ne∣ver say any Thing well but what is ill to say and therefore we must be very careful to distinguish between what ex∣acts the Title of Wit from our Judg∣ments and that which appears but such to our Corruptions This prophane Li∣berty  is too much us'd in our Nation and hath crossed those Seas which en∣viron  England  which is not so happily sever'd from the World's Vices as from its Continent But I wonder how such Men should have the Fortune to be e∣steemed Wits only for Jesting out of the common Road and for making bold to scoff at those Things which ought to be reverenced of all Mankind But we are fallen into such a prophane and sceptical an Age as takes a Pleasure and Pride in unravelling almost all the received Principles of Religion  However we must not think the worse of Religion because some Men are so bold as to despise and deride it for it is no Disparagement for any Per∣son or Thing to be Laughed at but to deserve to be so there being nothing so excellent but a Man may find Ways to traduce it and therefore we ought not to have the less Reverence for the Principles of Religion because idle and prophane Persons can break Jests upon them for a little Wit with a great deal of ill Nature will easily furnish a Man for Satyre there being nothing so Sa∣cred which by the petulancy of Wit may not be made ridiculous and those Buffoons which do so spare neither  their Souls nor Reputation to shew their Abilities by prophane more than inge∣nious Sallies But it were happy if Men would use a nobler Exercise for their Wits than to persist in their scoffing Humour which is not only an Enemy to Religion but to every Thing else that is worthy and yet we shall see some Men so prophane as to make use of Scripture Phrases to give a relish to their most insipid Discourses and were it not for this Magazine a great many Men's Raillery would want Supplies and they would be very Mute without this Topick In our Conversation we should carefully avoid the customary Sin of Swearing which hath none of those Allurements which other Sins have such Men play the Platonick to Damnation and the great wonder is that we see none who own God more in their Oaths than those that disown him in their Lives a great Absurdity of Wicked∣ness to have a God to Swear by none to Believe in none to Pray to There is indeed such a Deluge of Impiety and Prophaness at this Day overflowing our afflicted Nation that it hath brought down most terrible Judgments upon it Wickedness is now become the Mode and Fashion amongst them so that Men  there begin now to fear the Singularity of being Innocent and a Man may with less Scorn appear there in the an∣tiquated Habit of our Forefathers than to own the obsolete and condemned Qualities of true Piety Loyalty Duty and Sobriety And what Temptation is it to the Vulgar to be Wicked when their Superiors have beaten the Path before them When Gentlemen are Atheistical Clowns will think them∣selves very modestly Wicked if they be but Prophane and when they hear their Betters swear they will soon find they are as well qualified for that part of Greatness as the best It were very happy for our Nation if those Seducers of the People would sound a Retreat to their misled Followers and would teach them Religion Obedience and Submission as they have formerly led them to Impiety and Disobedience  But to return to our intended Dis∣course Gentlemen in their Conversa∣tion ought never to reveal Secrets Our Eyes Tongues and Looks are the Win∣dows and Doors of our Hearts we should therefore be cautious to keep every thing from breaking out which may be safelier hid than revealed The Wits of futilous Persons are like the  Vessels of the  Danaides  that emptied as fast as they fill'd that which comes in at the Ear goes presently out at the Mouth because Indiscretion which di∣rects to hearken as lightly as to Speak lets fly out as easily as lets in and dis∣perses as soon as collects These pub∣lish what they know only that they may be telling of News an itch where∣with their Tongues are strangely over∣run who can as well hold a glowing Coal in their Mouths as keep any thing Secret which they think new which is a most childish Vanity and Men must have Souls of a very low level that can think this a fit Entertainment These Men not having usually Depth enough to supply themselves out of their own Store can therefore let nothing pass by them no more than a Mill which is always going cannot afford any Water to run waste Now these Men are more Impertinent and not less Injurious than the most Malicious  Anacreon  who was choaked with a Grapestone died as surely as  Julius Caesar  with his Three and twenty Wounds and a Man's Re∣putation is as soon fool'd and prated a∣way as maliciously Betray'd nay per∣haps more easily for where the Speaker can least be suspected of Design the  Hearer is the apter to give him Cre∣dit and this way of insinuating is like those Poisons taken in at the Pores which are most insensibly sucked in and the most difficult to expel These Men are so perpetually Busie and con∣tinually employ'd in finding Faults with others that they cannot look towards themselves and whilst they put false Dresses and Varnishes to hide their own Deformity they cannot allow the least Imperfection of another's to remain un∣detected If these Men would look in∣to their own Hearts they would find such work for their Inquisitions and Censure that they should not be at leisure to Ramble abroad for it Now such as Busie themselves with Tales of their Neighbours and entertain Com∣pany with them furnish their Wits as young Girls do their Closets with Shells and GewGaws and since they bestow their Time so ill they should Study the Anatomy of Flies and to punish their Bodies as well as their Minds they should live only upon Shrimps where∣in there is more Business than Meat It is indeed a gross Error to think so we speak in Truth we may declare any Mans Faults for we must as well speak in Charity as Truth and yet many Men  will slide easily into Detraction think∣ing it no great Matter not considering the smallest Sins are the Devils greatest Stratagems and if  Satan  fetter us it is indifferent to him whether it be by a Cable or by a Hair St  Augustin  therefore who was sensible of the com∣monness of this Vice had this follow∣ing Distick written over his Table  Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam  Hanc mensam vetitam noverit esse sibi  The Truth is we should never in our Discourses make absent Persons the Subject of our Mirth those Freedoms which we use to a Man's Face are com∣monly more moderate and equitable because we expose our selves to the like from him but Backblows are disinge∣nious shewing we intend not a fair Tryal of Wit but a cowardly Murther of a Man's Fame But some Men think their Wits to be asleep if they dart not out something that is piquant and pier∣ceth to the Quick but this Vein ought to be bridled  Parce puer stimulis fortius utere loris  There is great difference between Salt∣ness and Bitterness and no Weapon cuts so deep as a reproachful Word neither is any Wound longer in curing And those Jeers are most resented which touch a Man's Reputation chiefly that of Wit and Discretion of which even Fools seem wary and few will confess their Ignorance The Reproaches of Wit are like the Corrodings of  Aqua fortis  they ingrave and indent Chara∣cters that can never be defaced a dull Reproach quickly vanishes no Person thinking it worth remembring but when 'tis steel'd with Wit it pierceth deep leaving such Impressions in the Fancies of the Hearers that it sometimes hap∣pens to survive both Speaker and Hearer and carries it self to Posterity Many a poor Man's Infirmities had been confin'd within a narrow Compass had not some picquant strain of Drollery scatter'd and disperst them And therefore those who rejoyce in Point of Reflection upon each other that love to disparage and backbite their FellowCreatures and gratifie their proud and haughty Hu∣mour in Derision of others should read those excellent Verses which to this Purpose St  Prosper  gives us in this fol∣lowing Epigram  Culpare in quoquam quae non sunt nota malignum est  Praesertim quae sunt cognita si bona sunt  Non pateant faciles saevis rumoribus aures  Quae nescire juvat credere non libeat  Linquantur secreta Deo qui si quid opertum est  Inspicit nullis indiget indiciis  Defamation is certainly one of the most unkind Designs that one Man can have upon another every Man being naturally tender of his Reputation which yields a Perfume even after Death and a Man's Reputation can hardly be tossed without receiving some Bruise the hea∣vy Scandals under which some Men have lain having taken their Rise only from some Inadvertence or Indiscretion and even doubtful Accusations leave a Stain behind them and often prove indelible Injuries to the Party accused And as in the Case of Stealing it is Proverbially said  If there were no Receivers there would be no Thieves  so in this of Slan∣der if there were fewer Spreaders there would be fewer Forgers of Libels the Manufacture would be discouraged if it had not these Retailers to put off the Wares A Man may sometimes do Things which to God and his own Con∣science are abominable and yet keep  his Reputation with Men but when his secret Crimes are detected then he becomes infamous so that tho' his own Sin be the material Cause yet the Dis∣covery is the formal Cause of his Infa∣my and he that hath divulg'd his Fault stands accountable for all the Conse∣quences that flow from that divulg∣ing  Some Men are maliciously apt to run down the Reputation of any that stand in their way either of Pleasure or Pre∣ferment When  Joseph  's Chastity had changed the Scene of  Potiphar  's Wife's Passion she presently fixes the Crime upon him So when  Ziba  had a Mind to undermine  Mephiboseth  in his Estate he first practises upon his Fame in a false Accusation And how often have we seen in our Time these Scenes re∣acted and tho' many Men have been Wicked enough to commit this Crime yet none have been so Impudent as to avow it all Crimes have had their Abettors only this Sort of impudent and lying Slander is so much the Dregs and Refuse of wicked Men that none have yet had Chymistry enough to Sub∣limate it and to bring it into such a Re∣putation that any Man would think fit to own it till our last infamous Age of  insulting Vice where this Wickedness has not only been admitted into Pra∣ctice but appears also barefaced which did always before keep on the Vizard for no Man had ever the Confidence before to own himself a false Accuser of his Brethren till that most wicked Age which hath not only permitted but encouraged and rewarded Men for being false Accusers to the eternal Re∣proach of our Nation and of them that suffered it  Next to avoiding the Conversation of these foremention'd we should be cau∣tious of Conversing with such who Censure and Judge severely of other Men's Actions which is one of the highest Violations of Charity and a good Man will never make severe Con∣structions but set every Thing in the fairest Light and put upon it the most candid Interpretation that the Matter will bear which is of great Importance to the Reputation of our Neighbour For he that gives the first ill Character of a Man fixes the Stamp which ever after goes currant in the World it being the Business of many to lay on more Load but of few to take it off for most People lessen their own Beam into a Moat and magnifie their Neighbour's  Moat into a Beam They turn the re∣verse End of the Perspective to represent their own Faults small and at a distance and shuffle the other End to their Neighbour to make theirs seem great Now such as make bitter Invectives a∣gainst other Men's Faults and indulge and palliate their own shew their Zeal lies in their Spleen and consider not so much what is done as who does it A Man that affects an extraordinary Splendor of Reputation is glad to find any Foiles to set him off and will there∣fore let no Fault nor Folly of another enjoy the Shade but bring it into open Light that by such Comparison his own Excellencies may appear the brigh∣ter But this shews a degenerous Spi∣rit and because he wants solid Worth on which to bottom his Reputation he is feign to found it on the Ruins of other Mens Diamonds sparkle in the Sunshine 'tis but a Glowworm Virtue that owes his Lustre to the Darkness about it  Tacitus  gives it as an ill In∣clination of  Domitian  the Emperor's Temper That he imploy'd himself in catching and tormenting Flies and that he turn'd his Scepter into a Flyflap and was therefore justly esteem'd an Enemy to Flies and a Fly to his Ene∣mies  and truly they fall not under a much better Character either for Wisdom or good Nature who snatch up all the fluttering Reports they can meet with to the Prejudice of their Neighbour  Whosoever hath a tender Side the World will be sure to find it and to put the worst Colour on all that Man says or does give an Aggravation to every Thing that may lessen him and a spight∣ful Turn to every Thing that may re∣commend him But that Wit is much misemploy'd that is wholly directed to discern the Faults of others when it is necessary to be used to mend and pre∣vent his own When we do not fre∣quently turn our Eyes inward to see what is amiss within us it is a sign we have an unwelcome Prospect at home when we care not to look upon it but rather seek our own Consolation in the Faults of those we Converse with  Indeed some Men's Tempers are so malign that they wish Ill to all and be∣lieve Ill of all Men like  Timon  the  Athe∣nian  who profest himself an universal ManHater 'Tis certain there are some in whose Ears nothing sounds so harsh as the Commendation of another and nothing so melodious to them as a De∣famation  Plutarch  gives an apt Instance  of this upon  Aristides  's Banishment When a mean Person had propos'd O∣stracisme being asked What Displea∣sure  Aristides  had done he reply'd None and that he knew him not but that it griev'd him to the Heart to hear every one call him a Just Man I verily believe some of our keenest Ac∣cusers in these Days might give the same Answer for no Man that is eminent either for Piety Loyalty or Moral Vir∣tue but he shall have many invidious Eyes upon him watching for his Halt∣ing and if any the least Obliquity be espied he is used worse than the vilest Malefactor for such are try'd but at one Bar but these are arraigned in all Com∣panies and in all Discourses  Next to rash Censurers Flatterers are most dangerous who may be compar'd to Flies that have pretty shining Wings for two or three hot Months but the least cold Weather makes an end of them or rather like the  Heliotrope  open only towards the Sun but shut and con∣tract themselves at Night Let the Ob∣ject of their Adoration be but eclipsed they can see none of those Excellencies which before dazzled their Eyes and their old Idol is often made a Sacrifice to their new and all malicious Disco∣very  is made of their falling Friend to make an Interest in their rising one There are such Crowds of Examples of this Kind in our Age and most un∣happy Kingdom that it is fitter to fur∣nish Precedents for the future than to borrow any of the past Times  This is certainly the most horrid Crime that could be committed and the black∣est Colour wherein we can view a Para∣site and as an Ape hath a peculiar De∣formity above other Brutes by that awkard and ungraceful Resemblance he has to a Man so a Flatterer is infinite∣ly more hateful for being the ugly Coun∣terfeit of a Friend A Pretence of Friend∣ship and Kindness is now become the general Bait to all base Projects all the woolfish Designs that have been lately acted upon our  English  Stage have walked under this Sheeps Cloathing and as the World goes Men have more need to beware of those who call them∣selves Friends than those who own themselves Enemies because the one traiterously Betrays you whilst you ex∣pect no better from the other  It was heretofore the Character given of the  English  by an ingenious Person That they were both excellently En∣dowed and rarely tempered by God  and Nature and were the most piously affected of all others and that there were not in the whole World either better Catholicks or better Protestants that there was no Nation under Heaven more remote from ill Nature and Re∣venge nor Men who were more ho∣nestly and even more naturally Just nor so far distant from using base Treachery of every Kind But alas the Race is now spoiled by mixture and we are no more what we were every one endea∣vouring to Deceive and Delude each other and that Freedom and good Na∣ture which was thought peculiar to  England  which is a kind of Balsom to the whole Life of Man and without which Life is no better than a Punish∣ment both to others and most of all to a Man's self is banished out of our Na∣tion and those Flowers of Virtue which were thought to grow no where else but in our Island are now degenerated into Weeds of Flattery Treachery and Un∣dermining Now the Suppression of this Vice depends upon those Persons to whom it is addressed let but Princes entertain such Parasites with a severe Brow and with sharp Expressions of Dislike these Leeches will immediate∣ly fall off In  Sparta  when all Laws  against Theft prov'd ineffectual at last they fixed the Penalty upon them that were robbed and that did the Business and if it were made amongst us as in∣famous to be Flatter'd as it is to Flat∣ter I believe it might have the same Effect  Plutarch  gives an excellent Exam∣ple of a Man that could not be persua∣ded to Flatter in the Person of  Phi∣loxenus  who being a good Poet and despising some dull Poetry of  Dionysius  the Tyrant he was by him condemned to the Quarries where having been for some Time he was by the Mediation of Friends recalled and at his first Ap∣pearance  Dionysius  shew'd him some other of his Verses which he thought his MasterPiece which as soon as  Philoxenus  had read he made no Re∣ply but call'd to the Guards to carry him back again to the Quarries a brave Example of a Heathen Poet who pre∣ferr'd a corporal Slavery before a mental  As it is a great Part of Wisdom not to be flatter'd so it is to pass by the Reproaches of others Herein we should imitate  Socrates  who being informed of some derogating Speeches one had used of him behind his Back made on∣ly this Reply  Let him Beat me too  when I am absent I care not  How∣ever it is good to shun the Company of those who take Pleasure in exposing others to Contempt and Derision as one would avoid the Heels of a Horse that Kicks every one he can reach  It is the height of Incivility to abuse Persons in Discourse to abuse Inferiors argues a mean contemptible Spirit Su∣periors is dangerous to abuse a Friend is to lose him a Stranger to lose your self in his and the World's Esteem We should therefore endeavour to keep a fair Reputation with all Persons with Superiors 'tis good to be humble and complaisant not low and flattering with Equals grave not morose with Inferiors courteous and fair not sullen nor impe∣tuous  'Tis an indiscreet Thing for a Man in Company to take Exceptions and if he have any Defect in his Person which he suspects Men are apt to make Derision of 'tis a Folly to vex himself or quarrel at it but the best way to prevent others in their Scoffs of this kind is first to speak and let them know as much as they can tell him and then he ought with a manly Courage to contemn as unconcerned the Indiscretions and Fol∣lies of others It is no sign a Man is  sound who complains because one touches him In my younger Days I knew an old merry Droll who much frequented Company who having in his Youth taken a great Liberty to rally upon married Persons in his declining Age took a Wife where every one might have had her for his Money and the first Treatment of any Friend in his Conversation was still the Discourse of his own Marriage to prevent all that could be said against him  And as we should not be troubled when others tell us of our Imperfections so on the other hand we should never Praise our selves It is a great Blemish for a Man to be the Trumpet of his own Excellencies he who puts a mo∣dest Rate upon his own Deserts does best multiply his Fame but he that speaks in his own Commendations does as if he meant to Sell himself And if the most accomplish'd would but seriously consider his own Imperfections how many Things he wants and how few he knows and those how lamely he would make use of his Reason and Dis∣course not for Commendation of him∣self but to gain Instruction from others Such Men's Company is very trouble∣some who are only accustomed to the  Admiration of themselves thinking no∣thing besides them worthy of Regard if these unbred Minds were made ac∣quainted with those Excellencies which God hath bestow'd on other Men they would not think themselves like  Gideon  's Fleece to  have sucked up all the Dew of Heaven  they would find perhaps they rather answer'd the other Part of the Miracle and  are drier than their Neigh∣bours  And if such will needs be re∣flecting on themselves let them com∣pare their Crop of Weeds and Nettles with that of their Corn and then they must either think their Ground is Poor or themselves very ill Husbands  Now the way to Profit by Conversa∣tion must come from our selves our Question is the Fire that draws out ei∣ther the Quintessence or the Dreggs of Things and therefore the usefullest Part of Discourse is to give Occasion by ask∣ing Questions by intermingling our Dis∣courses with Tales with Reasons and telling of Opinions it being a Testimo∣ny of as much Knowledge to ask a pertinent Question as to give a perti∣nent Answer But herein a great Re∣gard is to be had in what Company we do it for great Men love not to be asked Questions unless where Questions  may pull out the Thread of their own Praises He that in Discourse questions much shall undoubtedly learn much if he apply his Questions to the Skill of the Persons with whom he Discourses and put them upon those Things they understand best for thereby he shall do them a Kindness in giving them Occa∣sion to please themselves in Speaking because every one loves to Speak of that wherein he is most expert and himself shall continually gather Knowledge by fetching from every one the best that is in him for when Men are reduced to Speak of those Things wherein they are most conversant and skillful the con∣versing with them is an excellent School But we shall commonly see Men take the contrary Course chusing rather to Discourse of any other Profession than their own supposing it to be so much new Reputation gotten but this way a Man shall never come to Perfection As for Tales to tell a Story well to continue it in a handsome Method cloathing it with suitable Expressions without Impertinencies and to repre∣sent therein Persons and Things to the Life is one of the best and perhaps one of the hardest Parts of Conversa∣tion The late King  Charles  II my  Master of Glorious Memory had a most particular Talent of this Kind and was wonderful pleasant in Conversation and us'd very frequently soon after his Restauration to have his private Sallies in the WinterEvenings to divert him∣self with some particular Persons of Wit whom he still chose to Sup with him where I had the Honour divers Times by his Majesty's Command to wait up∣on him at Supper for he would then have none of the Grooms of his Bed∣chamber with him In these Divertise∣ments the King permitted those who Supped with him to make use of their Wits in telling some pleasant Stories and in quick and handsom Repartees wherein the King had an excellent Vein and would as well take as give without Offence which Liberty was always us'd with great Respect by those who had the Honour to Sup with him which were usually  Hannibal Sested  base Bro∣ther to the then King of  Denmark  the Duke of  Ormond  the Lords  Carling∣ford Wentworth  and  Crofts  with Sir  Frederick Cornwallis  Sir  John Mynnis  and sometimes  Tom Killigrew  In these Conversations I have heard excellent Discourses witty Repartees mingled with pleasant Tales wherein the King  had so great a Faculty that scarce any Thing could be said which he would not Parallel with some pleasant modern Story which He would tell with such Grace and Quickness as charm'd all the Company but when he found them warmd with Wine and that their Wits began to be piquant and sharp and to Sting each other the King would always then interpose his Royal Authority and would stroak over the severe Nips they gave each other by throwing Dust up∣on them telling them  Good Jests ought to bite like Lambs not Dogs to Tickle not Wound  Wherein his Majesty shew'd great Prudence for we have seen in our Days many Examples of the Mis∣chiefs that have hapned by too severe Railleries in such Fencings Jest hath prov'd Earnest and Florets have been turn'd to Swords and not only the Friendship but the Men have fallen a Sacrifice to the Jest 'Tis sure we shall die in Earnest and it will not become us always to live in Jest But the Gift of Raillery in this Age hath devoured the more solid Qualifications and is accounted the greatest Accomplishment a strange inverted Estimate to prefer the little Ebullitions of Wit before solid Reason and Judgment if these Men  should accommodate their Diet at the same Rate they should eat the Husk rather than the Pease and feed upon Froth and Bubbles  There is nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a Cheerfulness in Con∣versation every Thing being by so much the more lively and cheerful as it comes nearer to its Creation and nothing hath more light and sprightfulness in it than an ingenious conversable Integri∣ty Virtue is the Mind's constant Health the Pulse of it still beats true and even∣ly she is sprightly without Levity free without Discomposure and conversable without Coyness or Cheapness as free from Stupidity as Lightness from being a Log as a Squib Besides a Vivacity of Spirit is usually accompanied with such a kind of Wit as makes us accept∣able in Conversation Cheerful Persons being graceful in all they do are most valuable in Company For who had not rather associate himself with a Merry conceited Humour than with a  Cynical  Wise Man Many Men indeed blame Mirth because they cannot endure it which is to blame the Sun because Owls cannot endure the Brightness of it as if we should Quarrel with Light be∣cause our weak Eyes are dazzled with its Beams  There are some Men whose Disposi∣tions lead them to fasten and feed on Miseries and to glide over the Plea∣sures of this Life which puts me in Mind of what passed betwixt  Diogenes  the Cynick and  Aristippus  the Cour∣tier who passing by  Diogenes  as he was at Dinner in his Tub  Diogenes  said to him  If you could content your self as I do with Bread and Garlick you would not be the King of  Syracuse  his Slave And you  reply'd  Aristippus if you knew how to live with Princes you would not make such bad Cheer  'Tis true this morose and pedantick Philosophy is not designed for a Gentleman they are born to be Sociable and ought to understand all the Maxims of the World Com∣plaisant Humours assisted with this practical Knowledge gain the Friend∣ship of all People because they know how to set forth gracefully the Ta∣lents of Nature  There is no Means so powerful and apposite to divert the fixed and intent Cares of the Mind and to exhilerate a sorrowful Heart as pleasant Company and Musick which mollifyeth our Minds and stays the tempestuous Affections of it if there be any Dregs of Cares that lie lurking in our Thoughts most power∣fully  it wipes them all away They say  Alexander  one Day excited by the Mu∣sick of a Harp took Arms and plaid the Part of a Common Soldier  David  himself charm'd the Evil Spirit in the Body of his FatherinLaw by the Sweetness of his Harmony and we daily see the Terror of Death cannot so much affright Soldiers as the Sound of Drums and Trumpets does animate them the Singing of the Nurse makes the Child quiet which evidently demonstrates the powerful Effects of it in Nature it self and the very Labouring Men find Satis∣faction in it who Sing in their Work and without doubt the Voice persuades and instructs much more than Reading the first being accompanied with certain Spirits which we may call Living the other is nothing but the Pourtraicture of the Thoughts of a Dead Man  Sir  Thomas More  in his  Ʋtopia  makes Musick an Appendix to every Meal and  Epictetus  esteems a Table without it to be no better than a Manger  Lewis  XI says  Comines  at the Inter∣view betwixt him and  Edward  IV of  England  invited him to come to  Paris  and told him as a great Part of his En∣tertainment that  he should hear most sweet Voices exquisite Musick and should not  want the Company of fine Ladies and the Cardinal of  Bourbon  to be his Con∣fessor  which he thought sufficient En∣dearments to such a sensual Prince as  Edward  IV  Indeed innocent Mirth and pleasant Company whet out Wits quicken our Fancies and make us afterwards more fit for any Employment  A merry Heart is the life of the Flesh  says  Solomon and Gladness prolongs his Days  and is high∣ly useful when 'tis only our Divertise∣ment not our Business but the excess of it is very illbecoming and to set our Wits on the Tenterhooks for so slight a Purpose is abominable But merry Hu∣mours tho' they have a great Pleasant∣ness in them are obnoxious to many because if Jests wherein they are most conversant be well receiv'd by some yet they offend more than they please and create more Enemies than Friends For tho' Points of Wit be very fine in Discourse yet if they be made so sharp as to draw Blood those that use them may have Occasion to repent of them 'Tis true flashes of Wit give us a plea∣sant Light so long as they burn not but this Liberty must be bounded with Caution for Wit should rather serve for a Buckler to defend by a handsome  Reply than a Sword to wound others tho' with never so facetious a Reproach In these Rencounters therefore the Charge should be Powder and not Bul∣lets and we must take heed that we pass not from this familiar Freedom of Drollery which causes Mirth to severe Scoffing which provokes Scorn en∣dangers Quarrels and gives an Umbrage of a spiteful Intent  This pleasant kind of Wit is a Talent usually given to Youth to play withal and it is a pretty Gift to begin the World with if they understand the right Use of it otherwise it is an unruly Engine wildly Striking sometimes a Friend and not seldom the Engineer himself Sharp Speeches therefore which fly a∣broad like Darts are to be tenderly us'd for tho' they be Shot at others they are many Times thrown back upon them∣selves As when the Earl of  Rutland  who had been instrumental in the Pre∣ferment of Sir  Thomas More  to be Lord Chancellor of  England  and thinking the Chancellor did not shew him that Re∣spect he merited meeting him acciden∣tally he told him in Reproach  Honores mutant Mores  alluding to his Name which the Lord Chancellor sharply re∣turn'd upon him telling him  It was  not true in  Latin  but in  English  That Honours changed Manners  which was the Lord  Rutland  's Sirname Thus we shall see some Men's Wits whip Opposi∣tion and manifest the Quickness of their Dexterity in the Shapness of their Re∣turns like the Artisans Weapon that makes his Enemies Arms his Enemies Destruction and by a nimble Repartee turns the Words spoken upon the Speaker himself There is much Pleasure in this kind of Wit there being no such Stil∣latory as a quick Brain which refines and makes use of whatsoever comes with∣in the Pan for its Reception But those Gentlemen who have this Satyrical Vein and make others afraid of their Wit had need be afraid of other Men's Me∣mories for many times after they have given others Occasion to Laugh they are made themselves to Cry  The Rules to be given herein are carefully to observe Times Circum∣stances and Persons knowing when to Jest and when not to use apt and hand∣some Repartees natural and not affe∣cted that have more Salt than Gall speaking what is just and proper upon every Occasion which is better than fine Conceits which yet are liked if they be good but Equivocations Quib∣bling  with Words and Puns which have only the appearance of Wit are ridicu∣lous and yet these have brought some Men of very ordinary Parts into Cre∣dit There is as much difference be∣tween Jests pick'd up here and there and those that come from the SpringHead as betwixt wise Discourses and harmonious Fooleries between a solid Sufficiency and what is painted a Jest should never be serv'd up but once when 'tis Cold the Vigour and Strength of it is gone Many refuse to wear Buff because 'tis lasting and a Man of Wit will not Apparel his Brain in Du∣rance It is therefore pleasant to min∣gle Jest with Earnest for nothing pleases more than Variety and it is a dull Piece of Service to tire any Thing too far But as all Creatures by secret In∣stigation love to be doing that in which they are most able so these Men of Wit being delighted to hear themselves Talk cannot contain themselves within a Mean nor have Patience sometimes to be Silent so that we may justly won∣der such absurd Persons should speak so well Now there are some Limits wherein these kind of Wits ought to be circumscrib'd there being certain Persons and Things priviledged from  Jesting as Religion Matters of State great Persons any Man's present Busi∣ness of Importance and any Case that deserves Pity To Play upon any Man's Unhappiness or Deformity is inhumane and Men may be as oppressive by their Parts as by their Power and God did no more design the meaner Intellectuals of some for Triumphs to the Vanity of the more acute than he did the Possessions of the less Powerful as a Prey to the Avarice and Rapine of the Mighty and it is a much greater Barbarism to reproach a Man that wants the Gifts of Nature than him that wants those of Fortune for a Beggar may have im∣poverish'd himself by his own Fault but in Natural Defects there is nothing to be charged unless we will arraign that Providence which hath so disposed And those whom God hath blessed with higher Degrees of Sagacity and Quick∣ness ought not to look down upon others as Objects of their Contempt and Scorn but rather of their Care and Pity en∣deavouring to secure them from those Mischiefs to which their Weakness may expose them and their Folly should nei∣ther dismount our Wisdom nor violate our own Integrity But the World is grown to that pass that Men will rather  put stumbling Blocks in the way of the Blind and pull away the Crutch from the Lame that they may Sport them∣selves to see them Tumble such a de∣light we take in improving the Imper∣fections of others that it's become the great Excellency of this Age to be dextrous at it But good Nature is willing to interpret Things to the best Sense to take Things by the right Handle and will never go to the ri∣gour of the Matter nor break out at others Misfortunes for to be touchy and peevish in discovering a Fault to kindle like GunPowder at the least Spark is a sign we are perfectly wrapt up in our own Interest and that we have nothing of Sweetness or Balsom in our Blood We must therefore en∣deavour to sweeten our Humour and keep the Ferment down and tho' the World be full of malicious Men yet by this we shall disappoint the Pleasure of ill Nature break the Force of an Af∣front and make the Injury fall upon us like Hail upon Tiles rattle without Mis∣chief and at last to tumble into Dirt  To jest at Calamities is a great sign of ill Nature When  Caninius  a Con∣sul of  Rome  died the same Day he was made Consul  Cicero  would needs put a  Jest upon that Accident and said  O vigilantissime Consul sub quo nimo pransus est nemo caenavit nemo dormi∣vit magnum prodigium vidimus Cani∣nio Consule non sensimus ver non esta∣tem non autumnum The State  saith he  hath had a vigilant Consul of  Ca∣ninius  that never Slept in all his Con∣sulship  But this was justly thought a Fault in  Cicero  for Calamities are not to be the Subject of Jests  I love Jests well  said a Wise Man  but not the loss of my Friend  and those who lose themselves to shew their Wit are much like  Helio∣dore  Bishop of  Tricca  in  Thessaly  who having wrote the  Ethiopick  History ve∣ry politely and elegantly but withal somewhat loosely and wantonly was thereupon summoned by a Provincial Synod who told him His Work did more endanger the Manners than profit the Wits of his Readers as nourishing loose and wanton Conceits in the Heads of Youth and therefore they gave him his Choice either to retract his Book or leave his Bishoprick whereupon he rather chose to resign his Place in the Church than to lose the Reputation of his vain Wit And every Age shews us remarkable Examples of this Kind for Sharpness of Wit commonly carries  with it two ill Companions Pride and Levity ingenious Persons miscarrying in nothing more than in too much plea∣sing themselves in the Goodness of their own Conceits where sometimes the like befalls them which hapned to  Xeuxis  the famous Painter who having pictur'd to the Life an old Woman so pleas'd himself in the Conceit of his Work that he died with Laughing at it  Being thus prepar'd with outward and inward Furniture for Conversation it is necessary to consider how and where to bestow it for he that is provident of his Time will be also Prudent in the Choice of his Company and Choice of his Actions least the first engage him in Vanity and the latter by being Cri∣minal in throwing himself and his Time away  This World is link'd together by Love and Men by Conversation and one of the g  eatest Pleasures we enjoy herein if duly weighed is the sweet Society of Friends and Relations which multi∣plies our Joys and divides our Griefs there being no stricter Union upon Earth than that of a virtuous Friend∣ship and nothing can be more Satis∣factory than to Improve and Benefit  that Person who is thus become a Part of us  Men of Quality love to deck and em∣bellish the Place where their inhabit and Friends dwell in each other and therefore cannot but be delighted in beautifying and adorning those Minds they have thus chosen to live in by purging them from all Foulness and rendring them as splendid and illustrious as is possible and certainly there is no∣thing more ravishing than a Friendship thus entertain'd That Calamities at∣tend it as well as Comforts is but a weak Objection for what Goodness is there without Temptations and what Happiness in this World not to be trans∣form'd It is the Gracefulness of every Thing that makes it valued Gold whilst it is in the Mine is good for no∣thing when 'tis cut and beaten into the thinness of LeafGold 'tis wasted and blown away and quickly comes to no∣thing but when it is tempered with such an Allay as it may receive a Stamp and Impression then it is Currant and Useful  Thus Cynical Men who out of Pride of their own Parts disdain Company and can no more endure Conversation than Owls the DayLight like Gold in  the Bowels of the Earth their Parts are useless and good for nothing who cannot without Offence walk the Pub∣lick Ways they are Saints indeed in private and live only to God and to themselves but being call'd forth into common Life they are like Bats in the Sun and utterly ignorant of Publick Affairs And the Conversation and Friendship of those whose End is only Civility and mutual Visits like LeafGold they are blown away with every little Wind of Distaste or Neglect of Ceremony and in an equal Degree to these are they to be reckon'd who are  Amici inter prandium sartaginem ad ostium tabernae fratres amici ad osti∣um carceris neque fratres neque amici  But the useful and profitable Conversa∣tions which give a right Stamp and Im∣pression to our Minds are those Friends that will be Supporters to us in our Pro∣sperities Safeguards in our Difficulties Counsellors in our Doubts and Comforts in our Adversities With these we ought to contract a strict Acquaintance and Inwardness and to embrace their Com∣pany upon all fitting Opportunities using herein a wise Moderation which carries with it both an Honour and Grace of Manners for to seek Com∣pany  and to fly it are two Extreams to be blamed to shun all Company argues a Contempt of others and makes us generally hated and to seek too much after them is a sign of Idleness in our selves and makes us slighted We must love our Neighbours as our selves and to shew that we love them we must not avoid their Company and to shew that we love our selves we must sometimes be alone and take Pleasure in our selves The  Italians  have a very significant Pro∣verb which says  Measure it a hundred Times before you cut it off  meaning you should stand upon your Guard till you discover the Inclinations of those you converse with and therefore we should be careful of laying out our Friendship too lavishly at first since like other Things it will be so much the sooner spent Neither should it be of too quick a Growth for the Plants which shoot up too fast are not of that Continuance as those which take more Time for it We shall see some who have hot and cold Fits of Friendship that shall hug you one Day and not know you the next this Unevenness of Temper is by all Means to be avoided in Conversation a good Man will always keep a steddy Course of Friendship which may run  like a smooth Stream and never change but be a perpetual Spring for we can∣not find the Gust and Relish of a true and fixed Conversation till we come to a great Freedom with each other for they that converse only as Strangers are always under some Restraints and Uneasiness and do never open them∣selves freely the one to the other  In the long Experience I have had in the World I have seldom if ever found any Man's Company worth enjoying that did not begin with some Difficulty if not Prejudice for Conversation like Oysters is nothing the better for open∣ing so easie and so soon Neither is there any more dangerous Acquaintance than that overhasty Familiarity contra∣cted betwixt good Fellows as we call them in  England  who usually begin their Friendship in the Entry and strike it up in the Cellar where Servants are disci∣plin'd to be the Ministers of their Ma∣sters Luxuries whose Vices seldom miss to be taken up by them as if they were the Badges to witness to whom they be∣longed There is no greater Mark nor Discovery of a Man than to judge him by the Company he keeps it being im∣possible but that he shall much resemble them and partake some of their Qua∣lities  Si juxta claudum habites sub claudicare disces  says  Plutarch Bad Company is very contagious to the wisest and best settled Men  What befel  Jo∣seph  was out of Contagion frequent∣ing the  Egytian  Court learnt him to Swear by the Life of  Pharoah Dum spectant oculi laesos laeduntur ipsi Multaque corporibus transitione nocent  I remember  Aristotle  in his Problems makes a Question Why Health does not infect as well as Sickness a diseased Per∣son often communicating his Infirmity never his Health the Reason is says he because the Health of the Body hath no transient Force on others and is per∣sonal and not communicative But  Mal∣vezzi  tell us it is for that Nature in Providence drives away the Evil from it self and thriftily reserves that which is Good and for this Reason it is says he that those who have the Plague are desirous to come into Company that they may give it to others and by the same Reason those who have ill Qualities in them will be sure to work and apply their Vices like Rust into the nearest and purest Mind  Edward  II of  England  was a sad Ex∣ample hereof for his  alter idem  his great Favourite  Gaveston  was a Man of  excellent Parts of Body and of no less Endowments of Mind being both va∣liant and witty and if his Valour could as well have made the King valiant as his Riot made him riotous there might have come some Good of their extra∣ordinary Conjunction but seeing Vir∣tues are but personal and Vice com∣municative it made the King not on∣ly more Vicious than he would have been but Vicious where otherwise in all Appearance he would not have been The Consideration of this most mis∣cheivous and dangerous Conversation caused  Seleucus  to make a Law where∣in he forbad all Company with wicked Men And  Charondas  the Lawgiver punished those for wicked who frequen∣ted Lewd Company Neither was it a sufficient Answer which  Antisthenes  gave when he was told of his Conver∣sation with wicked Men That Physi∣cians live amongst the Sick for tho' they help sick Men's Health they sure∣ly impair their own by continual visi∣ting and touching diseased Persons But yet this must be favourably under∣stood for there is no Rank or Quality of Persons so absolutely excluded from our Conversation but only such a De∣gree of ill Company as may Poison and  Corrupt the Good for in nearer than Company our Friend and in some∣what nearer than him our selves we must allow some Inordinaries and ma∣ny Grains of Allowance must be given to make the best of us Currant There may be likewise Occasion sometimes of conversing with ill Men not for Socie∣ty but Business and for Reformation as our Saviour converst with Publicans and Sinners And therefore no Man is so tied up as to come in no Company but good Men for he that cannot live amongst the wicked must seek for a∣nother kind of World than this and for more perfect Creatures than Mor∣tals It was not ill said of the Philo∣sopher  Omnes odit qui malos odit He that hates ill Men hates all Men  And if a Man will love none but honest Men where will he find any Exercise any Object of his Love If a Man will hold Friendship with none do Offices of Society to none but goodnatur'd and sociable Men he will leave many necessary Businesses undone The fro∣wardest and perversest Man may be good for some particular Occasion a crooked Piece of Timber is not thrown aside 'tis good for some Uses the very Flesh of a Viper is made an Antidote be∣ing  mingled with other Simples and In∣gredients and by good Company and kind Usage many an ill Man is better'd And since a Magistrate ceases not to be a Magistrate for being an ill Man much less does a Man cease to be a Man and so to have Title to those Duties of Con∣versation and Business which are rooted in Nature because he is of an ill Dispo∣sition It is indeed a great Part of Wisdom to contract Friendship and In∣wardness with none but good Men that so by our Intimacy with them we may participate of their Goodness for Men are not like Bees whose Sweetness makes Things of another Nature Sweet it must be good we receive and then per∣haps we shall make it better but if ill we make it worse  Some Naturalists say there is a way of Castration in cutting off the Ears that there are certain Veins behind the Ears which if cut cause Barrenness our Ears are the Aqueducts of Know∣ledge and if we cut those that is in∣termit our Conversation with good and wise Men this will prove a Castration to our Understanding The Advantages we receive hereby was well intimated in that which  Socrates  said to  Eschines  who seeing every Body give  Socrates  something he said  Because I have no∣thing else to give thee I will give thee my self Do so  says  Socrates and I will give thee back again to thy self better than when I receiv'd thee  And certainly the Conversation of welldis∣posed Men who have most look'd into the Affairs of the World and have stu∣died Men as well as Business is a great Improvement of our Understanding and Fortifier of our Judgment especially if they be Men of Years Experience and Virtue and fam'd for Wisdom for their Testimony is of greater Force and some∣thing is always to be learn'd from them For where Wisdom holds with Age and Memory hath not unthriftily spent her Comings in upon Time their Con∣versation is certainly the wisest Book there is only one Fault accompanies them their great and unwearied Desire of Talking which seems troublesome to many that hear them yet I must con∣fess in my younger Days I have ever heard such with Delight and did at all Times most joyfully accept what they deliver'd who are of all others most a∣ble to instruct Youth and surely there is much Reverence owing that Age which deserves a fatherly Respect and Honour from us  A Gentleman in Conversation should be Affable not Imperious knowing Hu∣manity and Gentleness is a common Debt to Mankind and therefore will not contract his Civility into so narrow a Compass that it shall swell into Com∣pliments to them above him and not suffer one Drop to descend on those be∣neath him but will so dispose its Streams that all Channels may be fill'd with it But some Gentlemen like the Pharisee think they are not like other Men and having mounted themselves aloft look down upon all below them as little and contemptible creeping Things of the Earth not considering that the distance betwixt noble and mean Men is only valuable as a Defence against base and ignoble Practices true Greatness con∣sisting in despising not the Persons but the Errors of the Vulgar  It is great Prudence in Gentlemen to associate themselves as near as may be with Persons of their own Rank and Quality for in such kind of Friendships well chosen consists the Fruit and Uti∣lity of Conversation  To keep Company with great Men is very dangerous and he that soars in so high a Sphear runs the hazard of  Ica∣rus  for if great Men love his Com∣pany  it is either for their Pleasure be∣cause he hath Wit and tickles their Fancy or he hath Parts which they make use of for their own Advantage and it is common with them never to quit or advance such Persons but still feed them with Hopes that their De∣pendance may be wholly upon them and when such great Men die or are disgraced their Fall is the Ruin of their Dependants My Lord Chancellor  Ba∣con  wittily resembles such who have Intimacy with and Dependance upon great Men to Fasting Days which stand next to Holy Days but other∣wise are the Leanest Days in the Year The wise Historian tells us  Nunquam secura cum potente societas  The Dan∣ger of such Acquaintance is well repre∣sented in the Fable of the Lion the Fox and the Ass who keeping Com∣pany together they went one Day a Hunting where the Lion having taken a great Prey he bid the Ass divide the Spoil who put all into three equal Por∣tions which so much offended the Lion that he immediately kill'd the Ass and devour'd him and then commanded the Fox to divide who put all into one great Heap and set by a little Morsel for himself and being asked by the  Lion  How he knew so wisely to divide  answer'd well  The Fortune of my Bro∣ther Ass hath taught me  And if I had as well understood the Moral of this Fable when I learnt it at School as I did afterwards by dearbought Experience I had not stood so long in the Ass's Place but  sero sapiunt Phryges  Now there are some Men so far from this Humour that they always keep Company with mean Persons and those below them whereas there can be no true Friendship but betwixt Equals And therefore wise Men will not only avoid conversing with such who are much Superior but also with those who are much Inferior not only in Degree but in Parts for  tanti eris aliis quanti tibi fueris  and that our Thoughts and Designs will be such as our Companions are and low Fortunes breed many times degenerous Purposes and he that makes himself an Ass invites others to ride him and it is a very mean Ambition to be the best in the Company it be∣ing an experienced Truth That he who desires always to be the best Man in the Company he keeps shall soon be∣come the worst of any Company he comes into  And yet this Conversation tho' bad is not so dangerous as keeping Company with Fools Folly being no good Tutor to teach Wisdom neither can a wise Man contract Friendship with a Fool their Qualities being so far different For when any Man is taken with ano∣ther's Conversation it is a great Argu∣ment that they are both of the same Sen∣timents but a Fool serves for nothing but sometimes to divert an ingenious Man and no other use can be made of him  But those who love Multitudes are in worse Danger than in keeping Company with Fools for such live in a Crowd and a Herd is not Company the very smell of them offends a wise Man and where the Crowd of Men is there is the Crowd of ill Customs and since 'tis hard to avoid Temptations when they come single How shall we escape them when they come upon us in a full Body How can we think of any thing but Ill when we see nothing that's Good Young Gentlemen who are newly come into the World with great Fortunes and ill Breeding seek great Meetings and Sin for Company to gain Experience And therefore 'tis no wonder they are entangled in Debts and made a Prey  to Cheaters and embroiled in Quar∣rels so long as they frequent such Con∣versation It was in such kind of Com∣pany I conceive  Seneca  meant when he said  He never went amongst Men but he came home a worse Man that he went out  Amongst wise Men the principal End of Company is Conference and Con∣ference to be better'd by is not usually met with in Crowds where Men meet not like Bees to make Honey but like Wasps who love to feed in Dung in such Company you shall hear Men speak neither honestly nor temperately Slan∣der or Flattery ingrossing all their Dis∣course so that no Man can be better'd by their Conversation the chattering of Magpyes being better Musick than a Consort of such senseless Persons nay a Desart is to be preferr'd before such de∣bauch'd Companions for the wildness of the Place is but unchearful whilst the wildness of Lewd Persons is infe∣ctious  Besides these there is another Con∣versation which is that of Women and tho' young Gentlemen are general∣ly pleas'd to think this a very innocent Diversion yet none is more dangerous es∣pecially as to the Woman's Part and proves  often a more pernicious Calamity than that which thrusts Men into Hospitals Such Men as spend their whole Time like  Sardanapalus  amongst Women and yet pretend Chastity are ridiculous  If these hear of a beautiful Woman what Contrivances and Designs do they lay first to see her and then to corrupt her and make it their great Business as well as Trade for their Agents and Factors to spring such Game and upon these Occasions those will liberally Sa∣crifice all their Time of which when any charitable Office would borrow from them some Minutes they are then such busie Persons they can by no Means afford it but to go in quest of such Game to have the Company of Women is their only Delight and Pastime But Ladies must take heed of such dange∣rous Conversation and especially by how much the more lively they are they are the more liable to be hurt as the finest Plants are the soonest Nipt by the Frost  The World is a dangerous Stage for Women where Virtue alone will not defend them unless join'd with much Prudence they must have both for their Guard and not stir without them and all little enough for the Enemy being  abroad they are sure to be taken if they be straggling Their Behaviour there∣fore must ever incline strongly towards the reserved Part the deceitfulness of the Age we live in having made this Caution highly necessary For tho' most Men seem indeed Plantonick Lovers and so at first as humble Gallants they are only admitted for Trophies yet they very often become Conquerors and from Admirers grow into Masters Besides the World is not so great a Fool as not very well to know that frequent Visits made to handsom Wo∣men soon grow Suspicious since we know all Men are pleas'd with what is Handsome  Stimulus carnis  is a na∣tural Vice in all Men and Lust is no way better restrain'd than by keeping far from such Creatures  He that will avoid committing Sin must shun the Occasions for the best Philosopher cannot make me believe but that every Man naturally is pleas'd with a savory Morsel And they that make Profession of not staining their Reputa∣tion with Spots of Uncleanness ought to shun all that allures thereunto for it is not only a great Peice of Folly but an infinite Rashness worthy to be punished to make GunPowder in a  Smith's Shop with Hopes to make People believe there is no Danger in it  Some learned Physicians affirm and Anatomists do also tell us When a Wo∣man bears Twins if they be both of the same Sex they are enwrapped in one Film but if of different wise Nature parts them And if Nature thinks not fit to lodge a Brother and Sister toge∣ther in so tender an Age this certainly teaches us that Persons of different Sexes cannot live safely together and those who relie upon their Strength and Vir∣tue in such Occasions are certainly more Rash than Wise And those young Ladies who promise to themselves ne∣ver to go so far as to be gain'd nor to admit any but indifferent Favours such as Civility allows and after having gi∣ven Way to more than they should they find a Precipice where they expected only Entertainment And that Woman who will allow her self to go to the ut∣most Extremity of every Thing that is Lawful is so very near going farther that those Gentlemen who lie at Watch will begin to Count upon her For Men are apt to turn every Thing that a Wo∣man does to the hopeful Side But yet few are so Impudent as to make an  Application till they see something which they are willing to take for an Encouragement  And therefore it is much more honou∣rable and safer for Women to prevent such Forwardness than to go about to cure it nothing being with more Care to be avoided by them than such a kind of Civility which may be mistaken for an Invitation  I wish many imprudent Ladies had not found the Truth of this Men often stealing from little Favours to greater and still carry on their Designs till ma∣ny Times they change their Intreaties into Threats and their Softness into Violence and then those Women find too late that true Simplicity is abused when it deals with falsifyed the fear of losing their Reputation after having given some Advantages which they ought not to have done hath debauched ma∣ny Women and therefore they ought to be very cautious what Men they ad∣mit into their Company and of gran∣ting the least Civilities For as the Sun shining upon a LookingGlass melting the Quicksilver presently causes Spots so if a young Gentleman do but look upon a beautiful Woman a Flame of Love presently arises The ancient Phi∣losophers  knew this well which made them prescribe Absence for the Reme∣dy of Love that Men should not see their Mistresses But she knew it bet∣ter who said to her Lover  Discede discede a foculo meo nam si te vel mi∣nimè igniculus meus afflaverit ureris infimé  And what  Propertius  says is most true  Crescit enim assiduè spectando cura puellae  Ipse alimenta sibi maxima praebet amor  In the last Place there are some Con∣versations which are neither good nor bad profitable for nothing but only Recreation Men who seem as it were made for no other Purpose but to divert from serious Affairs And since even Saints themselves have had their Diver∣tisements and that all Persons are al∣low'd some Breathingtime of humane Delight we may therefore safely spare these Men that Leisure which is set a∣part for our Conversation and some∣times lend our selves to them that we may be the better enabled to return to our serious Employments  Of Solitariness and Retirement  T  HERE is nothing so Pre∣judicial to Action as to be always in Action for the Mind like the Body is tired by being always in one Posture to be too serious breaks it to be too diverting loosens it so that to unbend our Thoughts when they are too much stretched by our Cares is not more natural than necessary The Eye sees not the Objects touching it but those only remote and the Understan∣ding continually plunged in Affairs is not so quick and piercing as his who sometimes retires from Publick Employ∣ments Experience teaches us that the Eye having lost its quickness by much looking upon the Light recovers its vigour again in the Dark and as the most curious Gravers are obliged to look sometimes upon green Flies to recollect again their scatter'd Sight so the Spi∣rit being weakned and distracted with variety of Affairs ought to recover its Force in the Privacy of some small Re∣treat  In the Heat and Tumult of Bu∣siness Reason hath not Power to give Conduct to active Life Man having but an imperfect Understanding without Me∣ditation and therefore as Bees must retire to the Honey after they have gather'd the Matter from Flowers so it is necessary that we retire into our Selves to gather the Fruit of our Ex∣perience otherwise we shall be but ill Husbands of the Wealth we have got∣ten  Indeed the Fruit we gather from our many Days of Company is very little we scatter much in Conversation we gather but small Profit but for the few Hours we spend in Retirement and Re∣collection the Return is very considera∣ble and the greater Portions of our Time we lay out this way the more Treasure we lay up for our Selves here∣after This inward Consideration is a large and powerful Study to such as can seriously Taste and Employ them∣selves therein It is the Nourishment and Life of our Spirit and Nature hath favour'd it with this singular Privilege that there is nothing we can do so long neither is there any thing more easie more natural or more our own than to meditate and entertain our Thoughts  Thus as often as the Mind inter∣rupted in its Operation by external Ob∣jects would have the Body to be still and quiet it presently betakes it self to Retirement when neither Wife nor Children Kindred nor Business nor whatsoever else can make any Trouble are to be seen all Things being exclu∣ded that can disturb But since this so∣litary Employment and Entertainment of our Selves is either one of the best or the worst Things we can undertake it must not therefore be in Vanity much less in any Thing that is Vicious but in Study in profound Knowledge and in the diligent Culture of our Minds  He that will withdraw himself must first prepare to receive himself It is not Wisdom to let the Spleen govern us to overdrive Nature is to draw a Blemish upon our Judgment Men that retire should first examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize for without this preliminary Prudence a Man may overburthen his Shoulders and soon wade out of Depth And tho' Solitude promises fair and is a strong Engagement to a retired Person yet it is to many better in Prospect than in Possession It is a great Folly to trust our selves if we cannot govern our selves and he had need be very well assur'd of  himself that falls into his own Hands for it often happens that none are more dangerous than our own and therefore wisely says the  Spaniard God keep me from my self  That Man is much mistaken who thinks Solitude a Sanctuary against all Vices It is good against such as pro∣ceed from without us but it hath its inward and spiritual Difficulties And tho' the Devil be busie in all Places yet he takes Solitude to be his Ground of Advantage from whence ofttimes he plays his Batteries with most Success Thus we see he ventur'd to attack our Saviour himself when he found him in the Wilderness to shew it is most dan∣gerous for those to be alone that are not Masters of themselves there being no Security from Danger by running away from the World especially if Melan∣choly drives us to Solitude which makes the Mind uneasie and ill Thoughts are no Foreign Commodity but purely of our own Growth which are most dan∣gerous in Solitude for many Men who have well preserv'd themselves in Com∣pany have been lost in Solitude  Lot  was Chaste even in the City of  Sodom  yet defiled in his Cave To an Impru∣dent unadvised Man Solitude is a dan∣gerous  Staff and it's to be fear'd that whilst he Walks alone he entertains more and worse Company than himself Mens Vices many times giving them the Taste of Solitude making them so much shun Company and seek the more ElbowRoom For a Man may as well fail a∣lone as in Company there are ways for it until such time that he hath fram'd himself such as to become  Sibi Thea∣trum  that he so much respects his Rea∣son and fears his Conscience that he cannot without Shame stumble or trip in their Presence that he dare not halt before himself but bears a kind of Re∣verence and Respect unto himself which next to Religion is the chiefest Bridle against all Vice  Cicero  in this Case gives an excellent Direction  Observen∣tur species honestae animo Let honest Ideas still represent themselves before our Mind Let us  says  Seneca repre∣sent  Cato Phocion  and  Aristides  to our Imagination  in whose Presence even Fools would hide their Faults  and establish them as Comptrollers of all our Actions  It is certainly a rare Thing  Ʋt satis se quisque vereatur That every Man should sufficiently stand in Awe of him∣self  We should win so much upon our  selves as to be able in good Earnest and willingly to be left alone to quit the World if need be to dwell and de∣light in our selves We must break those Bonds asunder that fasten and bind us to each other and not so tie our selves to the Things of this World that our Felicity depend upon them but reserve a Storehouse for our selves what need soever happen wherein we may secure and establish our true Contentment and principal Retreat This Storehouse is a wise Man's Mind which moves and turns within it self and is well conten∣ted to keep it self Company and en∣joy it self And when the World frowns upon us and that we are barren of Em∣ployments we ought then to betake our selves to the secret Improver of Minds Contemplation thereby adorn∣ing our House within and make it rea∣dy if for Guests that is for Business and if they come not 'tis no matter it will be the better for us to live in Thus we must bring home our Cogita∣tions to our selves that our Contentment may depend upon what is within us nei∣ther seeking nor disdaining Employ∣ment but cheerfully go on either with or without it with a calm and undi∣sturbed Mind For this World is a  Comedy where every Man acts that Part which Providence hath assigned him and as it is esteemed more Noble to look on than to act so there is no securer Box from which to behold it than a safe Retreat it being easier to feel than express the Pleasure that may be taken in standing aloof off and in contemplating the Reelings of the Mul∣titude upon the Stage of this World  There is no Counsel more proper for Men than the Philosopher's  Tecum ha∣bite  to dwell at Home and not to suf∣fer any Thing to steal us away from our selves there is neither Profit nor Plea∣sure worth so much that we should go abroad to seek it Even amongst  Pagans  the wisest look'd upon the Things of this World as Lumber rather than Furniture as Things which they needed not and retired within their own Breasts which they call'd their Home there to enjoy Virtue their only Good And many of the  Epicurean  Sect who propos'd to themselves no other End but their own Contentment did bereave themselves of all sensual Delights and contemn'd the Glory and Pomp of all worldly Wealth and Greatness for the only Pleasure of Contemplation But now a wise Chri∣stian that may within his own Breast  enjoy both Virtue and God himself hath much higher Advantages and more Reason to keep within that Home and to look upon Things without with an indifferent Eye That Man therefore forgets his Origin and his Dignity that puts his Soul out of Possession of her self by running perpetually after Hopes that fly from him whereas he should aban∣don the Pleasures of this Life and bid adieu to all manner of Vanities shun∣ning all Passions that may any way im∣peach the Tranquility either of Mind or Body making God the only Object of his Contemplation He that thus re∣tires draws no Man's Envy upon him he reigns by himself and all the Pomp which Greatness draws after it is not compa∣rable to that which he enjoys in Secret for as that Man must needs be accounted most Happy that is likest unto God so Man's chiefest Happiness must needs con∣sist in the Contemplation of his Divine Majesty and of his Works And indeed nothing but the Supports of Religion and a Spiritual Retreat upon that sole Account can make a Man fit to enter∣tain himself withdrawing upon the Score of Religion Thus to shut up the Pro∣spect of this World that we may take the better View of the other is a pru∣dent  Precaution Thus we untwist our Affections and slide off from the World before the World slips from us thus to retire is the best Improvement of Soli∣tude and to be thus Alone is the way to bring us to the most desireable Com∣pany  To Retire for Quiet and Thinking is commendable  Amici fures Temporis  says the Lord  Bacon  Conversation is a Thief that steals away a great Part of our Time and usually stuffs our Me∣mory with Rubbish Solitude is a great Relief in such Cases and wise Men are glad to get clear of the Crowd for fresh Air and Breathing It is not Noise and Flashes Thunder and Lightning that make fair Days but it is the Sun's cast∣ing a clear and pleasing Light with gen∣tle Gales so a Life led in sweet Tran∣quillity which is the work of Reason is much preferable before all the great Successes which the World admires and which are nothing but the Extravagan∣cies of Fortune In Retirement we taste the Sweet of a quiet Repose and enter∣tain our selves with Freedom nay we live more in two Days of Retreat and we are more sensible of what Life is than in two Years full of Business and Trouble and we see greater Things in  Retirement than abroad in the World For what do we see great in the World unless it be perhaps an Army the Siege of a Town or the Court of a Prince We are quickly accustom'd to these which only appear great to us at the first Sight But in Retirement we look up∣on the different Works of Nature the Sun rising and setting a still Night and those Planets which so majestically Roul over our Heads which we continually ad∣mire It is observ'd by learned Physi∣cians that those who dwell farthest from the Sun if in any convenient Distance have longer Life better Appetites Di∣gestion and Growth than others who dwell not so remote from the Heats thereof Such Advantages and much greater have their Minds who are well removed from the Scorchings the Daz∣zlings and Exhalings of the World's Glory into a private Retirement Whereas those who live in the Throng of Business and Company their Minds lose their Rest and Tranquility and many times after a Man hath lost his Rest he loseth his Labour also  It is a great Misery for a Man never to be his own too much Acquaintance makes us Strangers to our selves the more we converse with Men the less  we converse with God and the Con∣tent which we may expect by our Con∣versation with Men is lost by too much Conversation I know Society is one of those Satisfactions which are reckon'd amongst the Pleasures of the first Mag∣nitude in this Life but when we con∣sider that the Advantage of Society con∣sists not in seeing each other but in rational Conversation it will appear that Solitude is much more Satisfactory for what Pleasure can be receiv'd in talking of new Fashions of great Pur∣chases of Advancement or Ruin of Favourites Victories or Defeats of stranger Princes and Armies some of which are the usual Subject of ordinary Conversation and in Courts and great Cities Men neither seek nor find any other Divertisement than visiting each other reviewing their Habits talking of new Fashions or of the Weather or some such pitiful Stuffs and if Men discourse upon more serious Subjects they are sure to be contradicted which often causes Quarrels Besides in these Rencoun∣ters Men are tempted to betray their Ignorance or their Malice in either of which they are esteem'd Blockheads or Quarrelsom And if we converse with those who speak with more Address than  our selves we repine at our own Dul∣ness and envy their Acuteness and if we converse with Duller than our selves we are soon weary and fret at our be∣ing in ill Company And if by chance we accompany our Equals then we are upon our Guard to catch all Ad∣vantages that we may be thought more knowing and we are so interested in this Point of Honour that such Conver∣sation rather vexes than recreates and many Persons make themselves cheap upon these Occasions whom we had highly valued if we had frequented them less  That Man who dwells upon himself and is always conversant with himself rests in his true and proper Center and therefore he that hath learnt Wisdom from the Folly of others and the Mis∣carriages of his own Actions will be content to see the Crowd afar off and not any more thrust into it but retire within himself It is true indeed there is no Place but there are means in it to do Well or Ill a Man may live a∣lone in the Throng of a Palace but if he may chuse he will avoid the Sight of it If need require he will endure the Court but if he may have his Li∣berty he will be alone for Contagion  is catching in a Throng and a Man must either imitate the Vicious or hate them and both are dangerous He that is care∣ful to avoid Occasions starves his Sin those are rare Men that can live in the midst of Temptations and not fall  Ne∣mo diu tutus periculo proximus quae licita sunt ritanda propter vicinitatem illiciti  We have never greater Cause to con∣sult our best Wits what we are to do and how we are to carry our selves than when Preferment or Publick Employ∣ments are offered us It was no idle Que∣stion asked by an eminent Man Whe∣ther if great Places or Employments were offered us we should refuse or ad∣mit them wherein the divers Abilities of Men are to be considered He that hath Strength and Wisdom to manage such Places may receive them but he that would live quietly ought not to en∣tangle himself with more than he can manage let him try  Quid ferre recu∣sent quid valeant humeri  the strong and virtuous Man may possibly meet and encounter Temptations with Advantage which the more cautelous will avoid and in one of these two Ranks every good Man is found and we may well compare them to  Hannibal  and  Fabius  the first always calling for Battle the other evermore declining it  There are indeed several Degrees of Solitude and those wisely retire who being harrassed with the Fatigues of a Publick Life foreseeing ill Weather are willing to put into Port when keeping out at Sea might endanger the Vessel When the Winds go cross 'tis Pru∣dence to furl the Sails Thus that great Prince  Charles  V when he found his Success began to fail him he present∣ly withdrew  To be able to check our Enemy to encounter Occasions to act our Part upon the common Stage of this Life and yet to keep our selves Upright this is indeed truly to live but to avoid Oc∣casions to overcome the World by re∣tiring from it argues a wise tho' in the World's Opinion a weak and faint∣ing Spirit who think there is no greater Argument of Imperfection in a good Man  Quàm non posse pati solem non multitudinem  not to be able to appear in Publick without Offence and who can only live to God and himself  Ʋtilis ipse sibi fortassis inutilis orbi  Tho' this indeed be the weaker Side yet certainly it is the safer rather than by an improvident Foolhardiness to  thrust our selves upon Occasions which we are unable to manage without Of∣fence  There is not amongst Men a greater or more frequent Error committed than in this Kind for in most Things of this World Men that have no Skill in them will be content to acknowledge their Ignorance to give Place to better Ex∣perience and will advise and consult with every one in their proper Mystery but let Offer be made of Places of Ho∣nour Money or Preferment no Man will excuse himself or acknowledge his Ignorance or Weakness to manage them whereas our Errors are no where so dan∣gerous as in the unskillful managing of these Things and therefore it is better to be cautious and wary than strong and hardy  Malo cautior esse quam fortior fortis saepe captus est cautus rarissimè  We read in Holy Scripture of a Race of Men so much greater in Bulk than or∣dinary that Men of common Size seem'd but as Grashoppers to them yet we find the little Men were always too hard for them and drove them out because the Gyants depended upon the Opinion of their Strength and Hardiness the others upon their wary Wit and Policy and it commonly happens so in this World  and we shall find that far more have pe∣rished by unadvisedly venturing upon the Things of this World than by sober and discreet Retiring  But many Men overrate themselves whose Expectations being great when they are not caress'd and humour'd in their Folly they presently grow chagrin and sick of the World and fall into a Fit of Retirement and Melancholy and will keep no longer Company with any These Men like Children when cros∣sed grow sullen in a Corner but he that thus shuns Company and retreats re∣tires only like a Beast to his Den  We have seen many Examples where Greatness hath ruin'd several Persons who liv'd with much Honour and Re∣putation before  Nero Tiberius  and some others enjoy'd the Repute of No∣ble Souls before their mounting the Im∣perial Throne which brought them new Vices with their Honours and made them as much surpass others in their Debauches as they did in their Power so that Publick Employment is scarce to be wished for seeing Men are tempted thereby to commit the greatest Crimes  Moses  who was the Meekest of Men whilst he lived in the Wilderness yet when Providence advanced him he so  highly offended God that all his for∣mer Services could not obtain the Li∣berty of his entring into the Land of  Canaan  And tho' at the Creation God found it not good for Man to be alone and there∣fore gave him a Companion yet to shew the Hazard of being in Company even  Adam  could not live one Day in it and be Innocent for the first News we hear of him after  Eve  was associate with him is That he had forfeited his Native Purity  When God intended to converse with  Moses  he call'd him from the populous Camp to the Top of Mount  Sinai  and Christ did not disclose the Glories of his Transfiguration at  Jerusalem  but on the Top of the Mount of  Olives  When God did discipline his beloved yet rebellious People of  Israel  he chose first the Wilderness then the two Cap∣tivities to be his School  History tells us of many who out of their Skill and Strength have given free Entertainment to the World and have made large use of it in all ways of Greatness and Expence when their Time and Hour came would rather have gone out of some poor Cottage than out of a Princely Palace and lived with no  Noise in the World that so they might have died in Peace  Charles  V the Prince of  Parma  and sundry others tho' they liv'd in all Pomp and State yet at their Death they desired to be buried in a Capuchin's Habit and if they thought to die in a State of perfect Se∣questration from the World was so pre∣cious how much more available had it been to live in it For thus to die not having thus liv'd is nothing else but to give Sentence against their own Life for we shall not appear before God as we died but as we liv'd to profess Desertion of the World at one's Death as most do is only to be buried in a Capuchin's Hood  It was a notable Answer given by the Philosopher to  Pyrrhus  who when he told him  He would Conquer  Greece  then  Rome  and so all the World Cy∣neas  ask'd him  Why he would give him∣self so much Trouble  to which  Pyr∣rhus  answer'd  He would do it that he might afterwards live happily and mer∣rily with his Friends  but  Cyneas  re∣ply'd sharply  He might live so pre∣sently and not take so much Pains for it  Men that are still busied in Publick Affairs whose Mercurial Genius inclines them to a restless Life they like  Moses  on  Pisgah  see Retirement their Land of  Canaan  afar off but without Hopes of Enjoyment And we have seen some great Men who would never leave Em∣ployments till outed of them like Whales and other great Fishes that never come on Shoar till they are wounded and then these Men have prais'd Retirement not to satisfie their Reason but their Re∣venge yet even this Proceeding of theirs commends Retirement since even the distressed expect a Protection there for Distress makes Men run where they may expect Help And certainly those who after possessing great Places in Courts have been unexpectedly disgra∣ced will be more really convinced of its Slipperiness than such as never found the Effects of so much Revolution Nay those Men who seek greedily after Pub∣lick Employments pretend thereby a Design for Solitude Thus Merchants seek about the World that they may gain so much as may afford them the Conve∣niency of a Retirement And Soldiers have often nothing to sweeten their An∣xieties but the remote Prospect of some good Garrison for a Retreat And  Caesar  himself said  Aliquando mihi licebit mi∣hi vivere He would have his spare Hours  esteeming that Part of his Life to be∣long to others which was spent on other Men's Employments  Now the wonder is that the same Im∣pulse which hurries Men to desire to be Great that they may be Masters should not with far more Reason carry them to be Solitary where they are free from those Necessities and have none to obey but God and Nature Masters who command us nothing but what were fit for us to do tho' we were not com∣manded  This Consideration hath made many Holy Fathers retire into Desarts where they scarce had any other Nourishment but their own Juice nor any other Com∣pany but God that they might tend the Work of their Salvation without Di∣sturbance There they did as it were descend into their Sepulchers by deep and holy Meditation and from those Hermitages inriched the Treasure of the Church with their Divine Works con∣futing Gainsayers and increasing the Stock of Holy Learning  But it hath not been unusual for some Men to retire from the World and yet look back at it as  Lot  's Wife at  Sodom  and oftentimes to keep their Hearts in it Thus did many of the Philosophers who left the World in Effect but not in Affection for in their Retirements they had nothing but their Arms and Legs out of the Throng their Minds and Intents were still engaged and they only went back that they might leap the better and with a stronger Motion make a nimbler Offer again into the World These Men did not take the right way they thought they had total∣ly taken leave of all Business that they might live at more Leisure and greater Ease but they mistook themselves and only exchanged one Employment for another for tho' they had shaken off the Court and Publick Employments they had not taken leave of the principal Vexations of Life nor had discharged themselves nor their Minds of the Bur∣thens which oppressed them they had not so ordered it that their Contentment de∣pended wholly upon themselves and that they could live alone in good earnest and at Ease However Men may converse with the World and yet leave it we may find Retiredness in the greatest Ci∣ties we may pass thro' a Crowd and not mingle with it and we may enjoy our selves in a multitude of unknown Per∣sons  as if they were the Personages of an  Arras  Hanging  Every Ship that sails must needs have some Part of the Ship under Water every Man that lives in this World must have some of his Labours spent upon the World but as that part of the Ship by which a Man sails is above the Water so that part of us which is above the Earth we must remove it from the World Thus some who have attain'd to that Sublimity of Mind as to be a∣bove all worldly Cares tho' they med∣dle with the World as being of the World yet they do it so safely that they cleave not to it nor are astonished to leave it  Thus many great Men after the Fruition of all Earthly Honours have much preferr'd Solitude As  Snatocopias  King of  Bohemia  after the Loss of a Battle against the Emperor  Arnold  he retired into a Desart where having lived several Years with three poor Hermits he at his Death told them  There was no Greatness preferrable to the Tran∣quility of that Solitude he had injoy'd with them which he esteem'd as true Happiness whereas that Life he had led upon his Throne deserv'd more the Title of Death than Life  And  Simi∣lis  a great General to the Emperor  Adrian  after all his Honours and Pre∣ferments retir'd into the Country for seven Years before his Death and caus'd this Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb  Here lies  Similis  of a very great Age who yet lived but seven Years  rela∣ting only to the Time of his Retire∣ment  It was nobly observ'd by that great Emperor  Marcus Aurelius  who was also a Philosopher That a Weaver or a Cobler would willingly sequester them∣selves from all Company that they might prosecute their several Trades and yet Man cannot retire himself that he may admire the Creation and exercise his own Soul which is the great Trade of a rational Creature and of a true Phi∣losopher And since Gain can prevail so far with Men as to make them re∣nounce Society and esteem Company an idle Folly why should not we reflect upon the great Advantages of Retire∣ment both as to Morality and Devo∣tion which are much preferrable to those Things which are in themselves but Tri∣fles if not Burthens For certainly So∣litude hath more Pleasures in it than any Publick Employment for it drives us into Contemplation which is so charm∣ing  that it may rather be said to ravish than please committing so open a Rap∣ture upon our Souls that it puts them almost into a State of Separation  Thus the old Hermits Members of the Catholick Church are often remar∣ked for being as far transported out of themselves as they had formerly tran∣sported themselves out of the World And even amongst the Heathens we find  Pythagoras  almost distracted with the Satisfaction he conceiv'd in finding out his Demonstrations And  Pliny  was so delighted with the Pleasure of con∣templating the Rarities of the Moun∣tain  Vesuvius  as for farther Inquiry he approach'd so near that he lost himself in the Flames of it  What Calmness and Contentment did  Archimedes  shew in the midst of the Ruins of  Syracuse  being so pleas'd with his Demonstration and so busie about his Knowledge and Contemplation as he heard not the Noise and Clamours of the Enemy and could not spare so much Time from his Intendment as to ask Life from the rude Conquerors when he was interrupted and kill'd by them Here was a Tranquility which look'd gloriously thro' Danger and Death It is not Pomp and shining Robes that  give Grace to the Body but it is the Mind within the Body  Socrates  that great Master of Breed∣ing tells us That young Men should be instructed Men in the Flower of their Age exercis'd in welldoing but old Men should withdraw themselves and retire from all worldly Affairs It being no less than highly necessary that a space of Time should be interpos'd between the Business of Life and the Day of Death that when they come to leave the World they may have no∣thing else to do but to Die And who∣soever hath laid up in his Mind where∣with to entertain himself in the Shadow and Retirement of his Age will look upon that temperate Climate of his Time as the most sweetned and digested part of his whole Life free from the Hurry∣ings of all the other he then treats him∣self with the best Company that of his own Thoughts and Observations and with the Philosopher when others are sorry he is grown Old he is only sorry that he was ever Young Indeed when Decrepitness kills Experience when Age acts the Prologue to Death and draws the Curtains before our Senses it is then high time to give that Life leave to think only of Death and to prepare for its  last Journey For it is a Right and Ju∣stice Men owe themselves who have given their most active and flourishing Age to the World to give their declining Age to Solitude and Retirement and since they have liv'd long enough for others they ought to give the Remainder of their Lives to themselves to call in these Thoughts and Intentions and since God gives them leisure to prepare for and order their Remove they ought to make themselves ready to disintangle themselves from their worldly Engage∣ments and since they have hitherto liv'd Swimming and Floating they should come now and Die in the Har∣bour it being but reasonable for that Man to shake off Society that can bring nothing to it he that cannot Lend let him take heed of Borrowing and when our Forces fail us it is then a part of Prudence as well as Safety to retire But for Men in the Strength of their Manly Vigour that are endowed with publick Abilities and excellent Orna∣ments the use whereof is only in So∣ciety for such to retire for their Ease or Idleness and to do good to none but themselves is very injurious to the Publick and resists not only Reason but Goodness both which join in guid∣ing  us to common Good A Man of excellent Parts who thus retires under Pretence of meditating and leaves no Fruit of his Meditations to the World is like the River of  Jordan  whose fair and quick Water is lost in the Lake of  Sodom  call'd the  Dead Sea  This is to Die living to lose the Quickness of the Mind in the Gulph of unprofitable Idle∣ness it is indeed leaving the World in the worse Sense for it is a forsaking Mankind and denying to Society that Service and Duty which we owe it  For if Men of Publick Employments and Professions should husband all their Time so thriftily as not to give any Part thereof to Business but bestow it all in Retiredness yet even thereby they would contract a Guiltiness As the Eagle were very unnatural if because she is able to do it she should pearch a whole Day upon a Tree staring in Con∣templation of the Glory and Majesty of the Sun and in the mean time let her young Eaglets starve in their Nest  Both ancient and modern Histories have furnish'd us with Examples of some Kings who have willingly resigned their Kingdoms and deposed themselves but whether they did this meerly out of a Desire to live retiredly or to satisfie  their Sons being arrived at Years fitting to Rule that so they might see the Suc∣cession settled in their own Blood or to shun the Tumults of Rebellion or out of Fear of some potent Enemy or un∣aptness of Government are great Que∣stions left as yet undecided in the World But if any Prince hath done so gallant an Action which is so strongly with∣stood by human Nature as to renounce a Kingdom by Virtue of a Soul in∣amoured of that Felicity which is injoy'd in a private Life and that out of a well∣disposed Mind he preferr'd the Peace of Retirement before the Hazards and Trouble of Reigning and that divested himself of his prosperous earthly Con∣dition purely that he might be Happy that Prince was not only truly Wise but was undoubtedly more bound to God for giving him that Power and that Performance than for making him a King But that King who shrunk un∣der the weight of Government where Men ought to shew the greatest Worth or hath renounced his Kingdom out of Poorness of Spirit that Prince is much to be blamed for that the true Mode∣ration of Soul is seen in gallantly under∣going Cases of Adversity and not in losing a Man's self in Prosperity  Indeed Prudent Men that know themselves not able to withstand the Temptations of the World will wisely and timely retire from it Staggs when they find themselves too fat are said to retire for Safety to the Woods and Thickets knowing that being burthen'd with their own Weight they are not able to run if they should be hunted which if true shews a great Provi∣dence in Nature And if we seriously consider we shall find that Multitude and Abundance are far more troublesom than Solitariness and Want in Absti∣nence there is only need of one Duty but in the conduct and use of many Things divers Duties are required Thus the Calling of a King or Prelate is far more difficult than that of a Monk or Hermit and the Sociable Life is much harder than the Solitary by how much it is more easie for a Man to live altogether without a Wife than in all Points duly to live and maintain himself with her and therefore Sir  Thomas Overbury  a very ingenious Man was us'd to say  That next to no Wife a good Wife was best  For he that hath Wife and Children Servants Estate and Business hath without comparison a more troublesom Task than he that  hath none of all these and hath only to do with himself  Facilius est domi la∣tere quam foris se posse sufficienter cu∣stodire  And therefore Speculative ju∣dicious Men do discreetly and piously that leave the Employments of the World which require the whole Man to give themselves some Intervals to the Office of Men as they are Men and Chri∣stians  Such Retreats as these are most com∣mendable where Men sequester them∣selves from the Troubles of the World that they may the better  vacare Deo studiis  For thus they do more good living out of the World than in it Nei∣ther do such Men as these embrace So∣litude out of meanness of Spirit or for weakness of Parts as not fit to attain Greatness or not able to bear with the World but they do it purely that they may arrive at that Happiness which is usually injoy'd in a retired virtuous Life  History affords us many Examples of Men who have known how to com∣pass the Prime Places and Supream Dig∣nities both in Church and State who have had the Acquisition of Wealth and Greatness in their Power tho' not in their Aim and who have with much  Honour relinquish'd Riches to embrace Poverty and to enjoy Solitariness and Retirement having voluntarily left the most gainful and weighty Employments and after a full Fruition of all earthly Happiness and Pleasure have taken a solemn Leave of the World whilst yet Fortune smil'd upon them A great Example in this kind was  Quintus Mu∣tius Posthumius  that Noble  Roman  who having been taken from the Plow to be Consul after he had govern'd that People and conquer'd their Enemies he return'd to his former Employment and being ready to leave the Senate he called for his Balance and by put∣ting the Fasces the Mark of his Office or Authority in one Scale and his Plow in the other did let the Senators see those Imperial Ensigns were far the lighter and so took his leave of the Senate and return'd to his Plow Such Men as these are truly Happy who have left Cares and Troubles for Calmness and Quiet they possess a Happiness which Kings can neither keep themselves nor suffer amongst their Neighbours These are so far from complaining of the World that they are content to for∣get it and are resolved neither to have War nor Commerce with it having  founded a Retreat to all their Passi∣ons as well the pleasing as the trou∣blesom  But we shall find few Men that will be content to do this Thing seriously sudden Wishes and indeliberate Proffers and Attempts to renounce the World are but rash Pangs of seeming Mortifi∣cations There are not many that will be content with a mean Estate that will neglect Wealth and Abundance and desire God not to heap too much upon them but to abate of his Portion There are but few that will with  Daniel  refuse the King's Delicacies and feed upon Pulse and with the great St  Paul  take Pleasure in Necessities Many in∣deed will tell us They are resolved to quit the World both in Mind and Body but Custom is a Thing we often fall in∣to by flying it and we shall not unfre∣quently hear Men swear they will not swear I verily believe many of our Loyal Countrymen have had so sad Experience of this World and do so little desire to learn that which they are ignorant of therein that they would be very glad to forget what they already know of it and do really wish they were like some of those Hermits that inquir'd how Cities were made and what kind of  Thing a King or a Commonwealth was  There is no Voice sounds better in a sober Man's Ears than that which cry'd to  Arsenius Fuge sede tace  which coun∣sels Men to give themselves Satisfaction by their quiet retiring  Crede mihi qu bene latuit bene vixit  said a wise Man But yet wheresoever we are or in what Condition soever if we can but tell our selves what and where we would be we may make any Place or State happy to us For we are so composed that if Abundance or Glory scorch or melt us we have an earthly Cave our Bodies to go into by Consideration and cool our selves and if we be frozen and contracted with lower and dark For∣tunes we have within us a Torch a Soul brighter and warmer than any with∣out we are therefore our own Umbrel∣la's and our own Suns  But as all Shadows are of one Colour if we respect the Body from which they are cast so all Retirings into a shadowy Life are alike from all Causes only the Employments and that up  n which we bestow our Time gives it the Tin∣cture and the Beauty Thus our Sha∣dows upon Clay will be dirty and in a Garden green and flowry so in our  Retirements if we only converse with Earth we shall be like it that is unlike our selves But if we be ingaged in more refined and intellectual Entertain∣ments we shall be something more than our selves that is than this narrow Cir∣cumference of Earth speaks us the Soul being always like the Object of its De∣light and Converse and therefore well says the  Roman  Orator  Erigimur    la∣tiores fieri videmur humana despicimus contemplantésque supera caelestia haec nostra ut exigua    minima contemnun∣tur  However it is not enough to be on∣ly separated from the Converse of Peo∣ple for tho' we have freed our selves from the Court and from the Market yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our Life tho' we change Places never so often yet may our Vices follow us even into im∣mured Cloysters The hollow Rocks the wearing HairShirts and continual Fasting rid us not always from them for a Holy Habit cleanses not a foul Soul And as  Socrates  being ask'd  Why one who had been long abroad had not more improv'd himself by Travel  answer'd well  Because he had not left himself behind him when he went to Travel  So before a Man leaves the World if he do not first discharge both himself and his Mind from the Burthen that presses her Retiring will but stir it the more and press it the harder as a sick Man takes more Hurt than good by changing Place It is but settling an Evil instead of removing it and if we cast back a kind Look upon what we have left behind we still carry our Fet∣ters along with us and are not at Li∣berty We ought therefore first to re∣cover our selves from our selves for without managing our Superior Part all the Pains taken about the Inferior is to no purpose And he that only chan∣ges his Cloth of Gold for a Monk's Habit and his  Point de Venice  for a Demy Collar shall without doubt be a Loser by the Bargain It is indeed no such easie Matter as many Men believe to make a safe Retreat from the World to truss up our Baggage and bid our Company farewel this is a Burthen which few Men can take up handsome∣ly For a Man to anticipate the Acci∣dents of Fortune to deprive himself of his present Advantages is an Action of extream Difficulty as well as of an ex∣traordinary Virtue  But tho' the doing these Things seem very severe to our worldly Imaginations and to those who never had Experience in themselves of this noblest Operation of the Soul yet doth this retiring pro∣duce so great Effects and carries with it such spiritual Charms and Delights that should good Fortune her self come in Person to find them out who are thus withdrawn to invite them again into the World yet would they shut their Doors against her and tho' she should tell her Name she should not be admitted The Religious retir'd Man is an inverted Pyramid Earth hath but the least Point of it A Soul that dwells in Heaven will not dabble in this im∣pure Mud or stoop to be a Copartner in the Delights of the Creatures that have nothing but Beast in them and tho' it be necessitated by its relation to Flesh to a terrestial Converse yet it is like the Sun without contaminating its Beams  Thus Religious Persons when they come abroad into the World partake not of any worldly Humour they can safely look upon the Throng and more truly than  Socrates  at the  Olympian  Games give God thanks that he hath made them not to need those many  Things which others so vainly and vio∣lently pursue Their rais'd Contempla∣tions inlarge and ennoble their Spirits and infinitely advance them above the ordinary Level Such Souls as these that were only lent the Earth to shew the World their Folly in admiring it possess Delights which in a manner an∣tidate Immortality and tho' at an hum∣ble distance resemble the Joys above they receiving here some Anticipations of immortal Delights as Pledges of their eternal Rewards for there want not Examples of some who have had their Souls elevated to such a height of intel∣lectual Contemplation that God hath made them as it were in some measure Patterns of the Happiness of the Life to come which he hath sometimes vouchsafed to shew us here below to make us in Love with the Piece above in Heaven  This Divine Contemplation is  pro∣mus condus coeli situla gratiae  it opens to us all the Treasures of Heaven This remedies all our Sorrows settles and composes all our Distractions and ravishes our Spirits with unspeakable De∣lights to which purpose St  Francis de Sales  says most Divinely  We see the Re∣straints which Religious Persons put up∣on  themselves we discern their outward Bitterness but we are not able to appre∣hend their inward Sweetness and De∣light the very Fire and Flames were to the Martyrs Flowers and Perfumes  How injurious a Scandal is it there∣fore which we are apt to cast upon Re∣ligious Persons representing them with angry and stoical Countenances and de∣faming them with melancholy and un∣sociable Humours believing Retirement to be a State wherein the Soul contracts a Rust which cankers its own Sub∣stance and makes it unpleasant to others Whereas our Saviour assures us there is no Life so pleasant and happy and tho' he himself is said never to have Laugh∣ed yet his Countenance is said ever to have been Smiling and in full Condemna∣tion of morose Humours it was prophe∣sied of him  Quod non esset tristis  in his Conversation  It is indeed an ill way of judging That Men cannot have Piety in their Hearts without Austerity in their Looks a Virtue stuck with Bristles is too rough when adorn'd with Flowers it will be willingly entertain'd a cloudy discon∣tented Face is not the only or best sign of Devotion very merry Men have been very holy and devout Men No  Man loves to see such Religious whose Thorns he is afraid will scratch him for Christian Philosophy hath nothing in common with the Cynick this dis∣guiseth the other reforms the one composes the Countenance the other regulates the Spirit the truly Religious are Austere to none but themselves their Thorns prick no Body else it be∣ing a Vulgar Error to believe that those which retire with the greatest Strictness should not have their Diver∣sions all the Hours of their Lives are not equally Serious neither are all their Sayings Sermons it being a Right most proper to them of all others to have this  Olium laetitiae  this Balm of their Lives this spiritual Alacrity which does even dignifie their Service to God For these seek it where it is to be found and therefore we may be sure they ga∣ther it from the right Tree it being the only Fruit of a good Conscience and since that is to them a continual Feast there is no Reason but they should be Merry at it This is the Substance of all their Actions and their constant Triumph having this they want nothing  Quamvis ipsis nihil est nihil deest  All their Treasure lies in the Temple of  Wisdom which they do so well im∣prove that they become living Books to them that converse with them il∣lustrating their Minds without Preju∣dice to their Sight their Instructions having much more of Power and Life than Reading can possibly be capable of  Of St MARY MAGDALEN's Life and Conversion with some Reflections upon the Conversion of the Good Thief  B  EING in a Place and Sea∣son where every Thing be∣gins to Bud I must do so too and vent some of my Thoughts tho' perhaps as all other Buds are yet without Taste or Virtue these Lines may be also dull and insipid and tho' the Pleasantness of the Season invites me it does not much please me since I see every Thing refreshes but I wither and grow Older but not Better my Strength diminishes and my Load grows heavier  There are certain Rules for the Bo∣dy's Infirmities which if rightly observ'd will effect their Cure but for the Di∣seases of the Mind there is no Rule for our own Taste and Apprehension which should be the Judge is the Disease it self  I am now no more transported with Jollity and the love of Company ha∣ving at present Loads heavy at my Heels which bring to my Thoughts my ill Fortune my old Age the Duties of a Man of a Subject of a Husband of a Father with all the Incumbrances of a numerous Family these Thoughts de∣ject me into Sadness and Melancholy and from thence into a serious Contem∣plation of the Troubles and Miseries of this Mortal Life which have farther in∣duced me in this Time of Solemn De∣votion to entertain my Thoughts upon some Divine Subject the better to com∣pose my Mind and submit my Will to the Orders of Divine Providence  I know well as no Beauty so no Discourse hath all Voices even in the worst Faces some Eyes see Features that please in the best some others see Lines they like not some out of Affection may Plat a Lawrel for that Head on which others in their Opinion would bestow a Thistle which may perhaps be my Fate However I am not ambiti∣ous to hang the IvyGarland at my Door least I should seem like those Hosts that use to meet their Guests upon the Way and promise beforehand a fair and ample Entertainment Let it please my Reader  rather to see and allow his Cheer and then according to his own Palate he may disgust or relish the Cookery  I doubt not but many an accurate Quill on the Wing of Contemplation hath already taken a high Flight upon this Subject my only Plea shall be He that cannot Soar like the Eagle may be allowed to Flutter like the Spar∣row  The Scripture is every where full of Variety like a Garment of several Co∣lours and upon the same Loom of Ho∣ly Writ divers Workmen may accord∣ing to their several Fancies draw out some curious Threds of Observation and that Brain is very unhappy that meets not with some traverse of Dis∣course more than it hath borrow'd from another's Pen yet I will not contemn the Judgment of the Wise nor refuse to learn from any Instructor I never read but of one foolish Cock that refu∣sed a Pearl tho' found on a Dunghill  Mens assueta operi per mille volumina s  lers  Ambulat atque suos aliquid se ponit in usus  The laborious Bee is the Emblem of a working Brain which Creature is set  before us for a Copy of Industry it is not always droning upon one Flower but throws her light aiery Body upon a second so to a third till her Thighs are loaded with a large Collection It is no less indeed than a wonder that of almost the Shadow rather than the Sub∣stance of so very small a living Creature Nature hath made so incomparable a Thing I had rather imitate this labo∣rious Insect than challenge to my self  Arachne  's Motto  Mihi soli debeo  I had rather bind up in this Posie some choice Flowers which I have here and there chosen and cull'd from the Gar∣dens of several Authors than boast my self with that little  Arabian  that I have eriscerated my self and spun a Web out of my own Bowels  Having therefore imposed this Task upon my self and finding nothing more particularly described in the New Testa∣ment than several remarkable Passages of the happy St  Mary Magdalen  I have thereupon thought fit to make her the principal Subject of this Discourse add∣ing some Reflections upon the Conver∣sion of the Good Thief and upon what happen'd to St  Mary Magdalen  in the Pharisee's House what afterwards in her own and her Sister  Martha  's and  what after Christ  s Death and Resur∣rection  Who this Woman was is much con∣troverted and is sooner question'd than answer'd I know such Problematical Disquisitions which have more Subtilty than Usefulness as  Erasmus  on this ve∣ry  Quaere  says are superfluous and of them we may say as the Philosopher did of the  Athenian  Shops  How many Things are here which we need not  And there∣fore I shall omit these Disquisitions and will not be curious where the Scripture is silent Whosoever she was she still carries the Name of what for some time she was  A Woman that was a Sinner  We commonly see some artificial Pi∣ctures which according to divers Sights and Aspects represent divers Things such an admirable Peice with a double Resemblance hath St  Luke  an excel∣lent Painter here delineated in the most lively Colours Look on one side You shall see a lascivious Woman offering her self to Sale in the most tempting Man∣ner step on the other side You may behold an admirable Convert attended with a Retinue of Graces View it which way you will here is the word  Ecce  Behold like a Curtain before some exact Piece of Workmanship which likewise  hath a double Reference to the Power of Christ who drew this Sinner and to his Mercy who receiv'd her  In this noble History are several weigh∣ty Circumstances like so many Wedges of Gold in a rich Mineral and one In∣got appears at the Head of the Mine  Behold a Woman  which is a Word of Emphasis and Energy and if this Star stand over the House a  Jesus  is within Here like  Janus  it looks backward and forward and so I shall discourse of this Woman both as a Sinner and as a Pe∣nitent And if it shall seem distastful that I insist a little longer than perhaps the Reader may judge necessary on the particular Sin for which this Woman was publickly noted let me put him in Mind of the Answer which the Comic Poet gave who being accus'd of having brought a Lewd debauch'd Ruffian up∣on the Stage and so setting a bad Ex∣ample to young Men  'Tis true  says he  I brought such a Man on but I hang'd him before he went off and so I gave them a good Example  Here is a better Les∣son to be learn'd All Women may ac∣cept this Woman as a Pattern to imitate and even the best may learn somewhat from her Story For how sinful soever she may appear at first let us suspend  our Censure till the last Act then we shall find how she became  à lebéte phi∣ala  of a Caldron boiling with Lust a Chrystall Vial of pure Chastity how she that at first was running apace into the  Dead Sea  did speedily turn into the Path to  Paradise  I shall begin with her Fall and con∣sider her first as a Sinner  But alas who is not so Had she not been a Sinner she had been a Miracle he that knows himself to be a Man knows himself to be a Sinner for in the Loyns of our first Parents we all sinned so that it is absurd to suppose a Separation of Sin from Man's Nature In our Conceptions thro' that Original Pollution we are all warm'd in unclean Blood and still we continue  ponere Adam super Adam  to add new Sin to our Ori∣ginal Sin This Hereditary Poison is in∣bred in every Man and the Sullage of  Adam  's Clay sticks fast to us By  Adam  's sinning all his Seed are become sinful and all his Offspring as in a continued Line do like corrupted Branches of a rotten Tree still bring forth corrupted Fruits  The most perfect and glorious Light in the World is the Sun in the Firma∣ment yet hath he his Paralax and his  Variation And what Son of  Adam  was ever found thro' the Zodiack of whose Life an Ecliptick could not be drawn A Man without Sin is like the Mountain of Gold or the Philosopher's Stone which have no Existance but in Theory and the Operation of the Understanding In Scholastical Speculations you will hear the Noise of such a Being but you shall no sooner find him than the Eccho in the Poet  Quem non invenis usquam esse putas nusquam  Such Utopical Perfe∣ction is only an idle Dream of the Do∣natists It is the Voice of an Apostle  In many Things we offend all  Nothing more certain than that Corruption has deep Root in God's peculiar People Even their best Works and they too like  Solomon  's Sculpture  a little upon a Pillar rare and few  will but weigh light in the Scales of the Sanctuary As the Curtezan  Lais  said  Philosophers did sometimes knock at her Gates as well as other Men  so the best Men are often overtaken by human Frailties let the best do what they can they are but im∣perfectly Good in some Matter or other they step aside from God's Commands It is a Truth as clear as the Sun that the Seeds of Sin are in all Men the Seeds not the Practice there is not in  all the same Eruption but there is in all the same Corruption Some are Kytes others Hawks and the rest Eagles and yet all from the same Eyrie he that bears Humanity about him he that's cloathed with Flesh and Blood cannot but Sin And yet tho' we cannot avoid being Tempted yet we may shun the Commission of Sin It is one Thing to dart and glance a wanton Desire and another to court and plead for it Tho' the Motions of Flesh be alike in all Men yet the humouring those Motions is not so It is one Thing for a Man to Sin another to give himself over to the Com∣mission of Sin This continuance in any notorious Sin is not only a Grave to the Soul but a great Stone rolled to the Mouth thereof to keep it down  What  Erasmus  says of  Paris That after a Man hath used himself to the odious Scent of it it grows more and more agreeable to him  is too true of Sin which by long Entertainment be∣comes Customary and not easie to be dismiss'd  We know that an expert Swimmer being under Water feels not the weight of a full freighted Ship of a thousand Tuns riding perpendicularly over his Head so whilst we swim in the Custom  of any pleasing Sin we are insensible of the Burthen of it for frequency of Sin doth flesh us in Immodesty assiduity in Impudence and that Sin is almost in∣curable that is steel'd by Custom which is a true Character given of this Wo∣man who is not described as a Woman who had sinned but  a Woman that was a Sinner  it was not a transient but a permanent Condition that gave her that Denomination her long continuance in her Trade had branded her with this Title  A Woman that was a Sinner  This Woman was of a Noble Descent and as is generally receiv'd was re∣markable for a luxurious and inconti∣nent Life and in those loose Days wherein  Herod  erected his Theaters and Amphitheaters Debauchery was very much encouraged And however Wan∣tons may flatter themselves and take that for true Doctrine which the un∣wise Tutor sometime spoke in the Comedy  Non est crede mihi adoles∣centi It is no such Fault in a young Man to follow Harlots  yet it is such a Sin as commonly drives to the Devil at once a Sin which once indulged be∣comes what may be call'd a pleasant Madness  History tells us of a certain Well in  Epirus  that will quench Firebrands if put into it and yet when they are quenched it will presently set them on Fire again Like this Water is a lasci∣vious Woman when she quencheth the Lust of the Body for a time she setteth it on Fire afterwards much more witti∣ly Therefore  Fonseca  the  Spaniard  hath Emblem'd this Vice by the Phoe∣nix which does revive and renew her self by the Fire which she kindles by the Motion of her Wings Thus we mourn perhaps and bewail and repent of the Sin we have committed and desire to give it over that it may Die with us but with the Wings of our Thoughts we blow those Coals afresh and make them Flame more than be∣fore  Thus we walk the Round first we act a Sin because the Thought pleases us then we think that Sin over again because the Act hath pleas'd us and amongst the great variety of Sins there is none more plausible nor more plea∣sing to Nature than Wantonness How many set their Souls burning in the Flames thereof and as  Nero  did when he had set  Rome  on Fire behold them with Transport and Delight How  many silly Wretches like the foolish Lark whilst it playeth with the Fea∣ther and stoopeth to the Glass are caught in the Fowler's Net For a lascivious Woman to give a short but true Character of her is the Devil's Pitfall a Trap to catch our Souls Her Eyes like free Doctors live upon the spoil of Stragglers she baits her De∣sires with a Million of prostituted Coun∣tenances her display'd Breasts and loose Glances Locks wantonly waving over her Shoulders her artificial Complecti∣on the Counterfeit of the Great Seal of Nature her curl'd Hair the Sophi∣stry of the old cunning Serpent her high Washes and Paintings are so many Lures to bring the Adulterer to the Snare  But chaste Thoughts will check and never stoop to such Enticements For when Fire falleth on Fuel that is wet it presently goeth out  When  Potiphar  's Wife one of the greatest Ladies in  Egypt  did inordi∣nately affect impudently sollicit and in a manner force the Modesty of her good Servant  Joseph  how much rather did he leave his Garment than his Vir∣tue Nor did he rescue himself from Adultery and Danger by Violence to her  Person nor neglect the Duties he owed her as a Servant but with the hazard of his Name Life and Liberty he made an innocent Escape to preserve his bet∣ter Garment of Chastity  The  Arabian  Proverb is elegant  Ob∣strue quinque fenestras ut luceat domus Shut the five Windows that the House may be lightsome  cleanse the Limbeck of the Senses least thence some Polluti∣on drop into the Soul If at once we would overcome the Temptation and the Tempter we must resolve with  Alipius  to shut our Eyes when we come amongst Vanities for the Eye is the first Part that is struck in such Engage∣ments upon the first Assault it yields up our strongest Fort The  Eye  besides is the vainest of all the Senses it takes ex∣tream Delight to be cheated one of the Pleasures of the Eye is the Decep∣tion of it and how easie is that Sense deluded which delights to be deceived  The antient Philosophers before  A∣ristotle  that held Vision to be perform'd by an Emission of Beams imagin'd the Eye to be of a fiery Nature wherein they were confirm'd by observing if the Eye had a Blow Fire seems to spar∣kle out of it But certainly how watry soever better Experience hath found the  Substance of the Eye it is  spiritually fiery  both actively and passively pas∣sively for that it is inflamed by every wanton Beam actively it sets the whole Heart on Fire with the inordinate Flames of Concupisence Thus  Sichem  saw  Di∣nah  and defiled her  Viderunt Oculi ra∣puerant pectora flammoe  no sooner did he see her than his Breast was inflam'd with  Lust  Thus  Amon  fell sick for  Tamar  's Sake his Desire of her began at the first Interview Thus when  David  walked upon the Roof of his Palace and dis∣covered from thence a beautiful Woman washing her self here was  Mulier longè libido prope  for his petulant Eye recoil'd upon his Heart and smote him with vitious Desires Yet it is not the  Eye  it self for what is that but the Beauty of the Face the bright Star of the Orb it moves in but the Viciousness of the  Eye  that is to be condemned when we talk with our Eyes then 'tis that we sin with them But I dare not inlarge up∣on this Subject for fear of committing that which was a noted Fault in  Marcel∣lus  the Rhetorition as  Suetonius  tells us that lighting on a Figure he would pursue it till he forgot the Matter in hand I will therefore return to discourse more particularly of this  Woman  so sin∣ful  in her Life so hateful for her Lust and so devoted to Incontinence that she was become a common Scandal For by her bad Example she made the City so infamous that she might more fitly be call'd  peccatum Hierosolymae quam peccatrix  the Sin of  Jerusalem  rather than a Sinner in  Jerusalem  as  Petrus Chrysologus  observes because the whole City shar'd the Disgrace which she de∣serv'd  Sin is Sin wherever committed whe∣ther before a Multitude or in a Desart yet the more publick the Fact is the greater is the Scandal and this Woman's Offence was the more notorious be∣cause she was a  City Sinner  I confess that no Place can secure one from Temptations which come in too hastily and uninvited like rough Winds from every Corner of the Sky and in such Number as if each Minute were computed by them  We are apt to Fall because we are Mutable but we do not commonly Fall except some Occasion be given and how full is the World of such Occasions Our common Adversary the  Devil  who has a thousand Ways of attacking us finds how apt we are to stumble at something or other in our way He  knows which way our corrupted Na∣ture bends he sifteth out what will work upon our Affections and Disposi∣tions and with that he wooes our Con∣sent to Sin like a skilful Sailor he marks the Wind and accordingly hoisteth up or striketh Sail or like a cunning Poet he gives every Actor a Part agreeable and makes a perpetual Use of the Bent of our Nature Thus hath he a Wedge of Gold for covetous  Achan  a Crown for ambitious  Absalom  and a  Dinah  for  Sichem  And the Concurrence of Time and Place are his principal Engines which serve to give Aim to such Faults as our Nature is too apt to commit with∣out a Prompter then surely in a cor∣rupt debauched  City  are more Invitati∣ons to Sin than in private Cells In a large Concourse of People you'll find many Brokers of Villany who live up∣on the Spoil of the unthinking Part of Mankind Where many Pots are boil∣ing there must needs be much  Scum  where Multitudes of Strangers meet where Variety of Delights entertain the Eye it is more difficult to avoid Tem∣ptations for our Nature herein is like Fire which if there be any Infection in the Room draws it to its self or like Jeat which omitting all more noble  and precious things attracts only Straws and Dirt  It was in a  City  where this Woman liv'd where by her lewd Example she drew in others to offend and her Ex∣ample was more prejudicial because she was of a good Family  Satan  's Infecti∣ons many times send their Influence through some great Star into lesser Bo∣dies for Example is like a Stone thrown into a Pond which makes Cir∣cles which dilate themselves till they are stopped by the Banks or like a Plaguesore which infects the Bystanders and Lookers on  I do not find the Name of the City set down yet many are bold to affirm it was  Naim  others will have it  Jeru∣salem  whereever she liv'd she was too well known in her Time and having al∣ready shew'd what her Offence was I will not lay my Finger again upon that Blot and having thus far drawn the black Lines of her Life I will now look on the other Part and consider her as she hath put off the  Sinner  and as she is now become a  Penitent  Scipio  as  Livy  says never look'd so fresh nor appeared so lovely to the Eyes of his Soldiers as after his Recovery from a dangerous Sickness in the Camp so  neither does the  Soul  ever seem more beautiful than when she is restor'd to Health after some dangerous Conflict The  Palladium  was very much esteem'd by both  Trojans  and  Graecians  not so much for the Matter or Workmanship as because it was snatch'd out of the Flames of  Troy  so no Soul is more pre∣cious in the Sight of  God  and his  Angels  than that which is snatched out of the Fire of Hell and Jaws of Death  To see Men turning from God to the World from Piety to Prophaness is as common as lamentable every Day's Ex∣perience shews us such Sights But to see Men return to God is as happy as wondrous to  Men  and  Angels  and what is more strange we see the first Disciples that came to  Christ  were such as were most desperately enthrall'd to  Satan  The  Magi Publicans  Harlots the Thief the Blasphemer  c  This shews the Depth of  Christ  's unspeakable Mercy who of the knottiest and most crooked Timber can make Rafters and Cielings for his own House Thus he can call a  Zachaeus  from a  Tollbooth  to be a  Disciple  and  Mathew  to be an  A∣postle  and this sinful Woman to be a Con∣vert who it seems came to  Jesus  in  Simon  the  Pharisee  's House who had invited Christ to eat with him  She came not as the staring Multi∣tude to glut her Eyes with the Sight of a Miracle and his glorious Person nor as did the Centurion or the  Syro∣phenitian Woman  or the Ruler of the Synagogue for Cure of her Sickness or in behalf of her Friend or Child or Servant but the only Example of this sort of coming came for a Cure not of any bodily Grief or Malady but for her Sins She came with Remorse and Re∣gret for them to lay her Burthen at  Je∣sus  's Feet to present him with a broken and penitent Heart a weeping Eye and great Affliction for she came humbling her self and fell down before him weep∣ing bitterly for her Sins pouring out a Flood of Tears large enough to wash the Feet of  Jesus  which she wip'd with the Hairs of her Head  Purgata recessit  Per gemitum propriique lavans in gur∣gite fletûs  Munda suis lacrymis redit detersa ca∣pillis  But amongst all the Demonstrations of God's Mercy we can never enough magnifie his Goodness and Power in the Conversion of the dying Thief who was execrable amongst Men and a Blasphe∣mer  of God My Soul is lost in Amaze∣ment when I think of him the Of∣fender came to die nothing was in his Thoughts but his Guilt and Torment  Christ  was silent when he revil'd him and being yet in his Blood  Christ  said  this Soul shall live  his good Spirit so breath'd upon him and the Force of his Grace work'd so instantly and pow∣erfully that his last Hour was his first wherein he knew his  Saviour  to be God  In ipso Crucis candelabro Sol resplenduit The Sun did shine upon him from the Can∣dlestick of the Cross  The Light where∣of was so powerful that it awakned this drowsie sleeping Thief leaving him so well instructed that he presently burns with a zealous Impatience he cannot hear the Revilings of his Companion but suddenly he becomes a Convert chiding his Fellowsufferer saying  Doest not thou fear God seeing thou art in the same Condemnation  He confesses his Sins  We receive the just Rewards of our Deeds But this Man hath done nothing amiss  wherein he shews himself a Do∣ctor to preach and lastly he becomes a  Martyr  praying  Lord remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom  He that before had in his Eye nothing but present Death is now lifted above his Cross in a blessed Ambition  Lord remem∣ber  me when thou comst into thy Kingdom  Is this the Voice of a  Thief  or of a  Disciple Dic ô Latro ubi Thronus ex Saphyro ubi Cherubin exercitus coeli ubi Co∣rona Sceptrum purpura ut Eum dicas Regem  Tell me O Thief what in∣duc'd thee to stile him  King  Where is his Throne Where are the  Cherubin  and the whole Host of Heaven Seest thou any other  Crown  than that of  Thorus  any other  Scepter  than strong  Iron Nails  driven up to the Head through the Palms of those blessed Hands any other  Purple  but his  Blood  any other  Throne  but his  Cross  What dost thou see that can persuade thee to call him King O Faith greater than Death that can look beyond a  Cross  at a  Crown  beyond  Dissolution  at a Remembrance of  Life  and  Glory  as no Disciple could be more faithful so no Saint could be more hap∣py  Nam juxta fluenta plenissimae grati∣am simul accepit gloriam For Grace and Glory with a full Tide both at once came flowing in upon him  The Reward every way outweighed the Request  Magis velox erat praemium quàm petitio ubetior gratia quam precatio It was a greater Favour  saith St  Leo    to put this so discreet and humble a Petition into this Thief's Heart but a much greater Favour to give him so good and quick a  Dispatch  St  Cyprian  says  Quid tu Domine Stephano amplius contulisti  What could the  Martyr  St  Stephen  en∣joy more or that beloved Disciple that lean'd on  Christ  's Bosom Or what could the long Services of those that en∣dur'd the Heat of the Day obtain more at God's Hands But God gives them this Answer  I do thee no Wrong didst not thou agree with me for a Penny  Some Labourers were working hard in the Vineyard from the  first  Hour others from the  third  others began at the  ninth  when the Sun was setting first came  Adam  then  Noah  after him  Abra∣ham  and the rest of the Holy  Pro∣phets  but this  Thief  came at the Sunsetting and he that in the Morning was on his way towards  Hell  is in the Even∣ing with his Lord in  Paradise  For no sooner had he cried  Lord remember  but  Christ  answers him immediately  I say unto thee  and promises  thou shalt  and seals that Promise with a Verily and promises more than is asked and that soon  Verily I say unto thee thou shalt this Day be with me in Paradise  So soon as  Christ  afforded this  Thief  any Call he came and yet this Thief's Conversion is become a Proverb and satisfies and serves a Sinner in all Cases of a late and Deathbed Repentance  But they that urge him as a Precedent ought to consider that this  Thief  was not converted at  last  but at  first  and when we can find out such another Day we may expect such another Mercy a Day that open'd the Graves of the Dead a Day that divided the Veil of the Tem∣ple it self a Day which the  Sun  durst not see a Day that saw the Soul of God if I may so say seeing that  God  was  Man  too depart from  Man  there shall be no more such Days and therefore we must not presume upon such Mercy  To the Chief of the Apostles St  Peter Christ  says  Whither I go thou can'st not come  but to this  Thief  he says  This Day thou shalt be with me in Para∣dise  So soon did  Christ  bring this Thief to that height of Faith that e∣ven in that low Estate upon the  Cross  he pray'd for a  Spiritual Kingdom  whereas the  Apostles  themselves whom  Christ  had estated in  Heaven  and had given them Reversions of judiciary Places twelve Seats to judge the twelve Tribes yet in that Exaltation when  Christ  was ascending they talked to him of a Temporal Kingdom  Sic fa∣cit fides innocentem latronem facit infide∣litas Apostolos criminosos Christ  in∣fused so much Faith into this  Thief  as justify'd him and leaves the  Apostles  so far to their Infirmities as endangers them  This  Thief  came to know those Wounds that were in  Christ  's Body were his own Wounds in the Body of his  Saviour  so he came to declare per∣fect Faith in professing  Christ  's Inno∣cence perfect Hope in the  memento mei  and perfect Charity in rebuking his Companion He was such a  Thief  as deserved Praise and Wonder who had a good Bargain of Death and was the better and longer lived for being Hang∣ed for he was thereby made Partaker of  Christ  's Martyrdom and Kingdom And this  Thief  hath done nothing but what we may all do if we will lay hold on that Grace as he did  Assumemus vocem latronis si nolumus esse latrones ut sedeamus à Dextris pendeamus à Dextris  Let us be content to suffer but suffer in the Right suffering as a Malefactor is somewhat too much on the Left Hand and yet even that Suffering does bring many to the Right Hand being joyned with a true and hearty Re∣pentance which is as a City of Refuge to fly unto it is the happy Plank that has sav'd many a  Soul  from the  Gulph  of De∣spair the Board which after Shipwrack  will carry us safe unto Land and it is not ill compared to a  Phaenix  's Nest wherein the  Old Adam  is consum'd to Ashes out of which arises a new Man of God for Conversion is a Sacred Rid∣dle wherein when we are Born we are Buried and when we are quicken'd we are kill'd and when we are mortified we are rais'd Thus  Nineve  was over∣thrown and yet not overthrown it was overthrown by Sin and built again by Repentance He that is a skillful Peni∣tent does cunningly play this Aftergame and a Sinner after his Recovery for the most part seeks  God  more fervently and is more fearful of Relapsing than be∣fore of Sinning like wild Beasts break∣ing from their Toils they are more cau∣tious for the future and the  Saints  come out of the Bed of their Sins as  Heze∣kiah  did out of his sick Bed more Hum∣ble more Holy more Penitent as the  Eagle  that is weary'd comes out of the Water into which she has dip'd her Wings with a more towering Ascent towards  Heaven  than ever  Dum pete∣ret Regem  says  Martial  when  Mutius Scaevola  missed his Aim and instead of killing  Porsenna  slew one of his Secre∣taries by mistake he presently offer'd that Hand which gave the Blow as a  willing Sacrifice to the Flame which Hand grew famous for being deceiv'd and it had been less Reputation to have struck his Enemy to the Heart than to punish it so stoutly for missing its Aim upon which the Poet took Occasion to say  Major deceptae fama est gloria dextrae  Si non errasset fecerat illa minus  Without any change I may apply it to  Mary Magdalen  's Conversion  Si non peccasset fecerat illa minus  She would not have been so famous had she not sinn'd neither is this a Parodox for what an Enemy would upbraid by way of Reproach is the greatest Praise that can be their very Sins do honour some as the  Devils  did  Mary Magdalen  who are mention'd for her Glory since we do not hear of them until they were cast out For Repentance is a  Super∣cedeas  that dischargeth Sin making  God  to be merciful  Angels  to be joyful and  Man  to be acceptable And as St  Austin  affirms  It is a greater Deliverance a mightier Miracle and a bigger Grace that a Sinner should be Converted than  that being converted he should after∣wards be saved  Here we see  Mary Magdalen  being now touch'd with Re∣pentance for her former Sins and Vani∣ties like the thirsty and panting Hart in the extremity of Heat does eagerly long for the cooling Springs Her Soul was deeply wounded with the sting of her Sins it stuck so fast that she could not get it out therefore with the woun∣ded Deer she comes to the Soveraign  Dittany  to expel it the Pool of her Conscience was troubled and with the descending Angel instantly she steps in for a Cure for  ut cognovit venit  as soon as she knew where  Jesus  was she makes haste to him And the Zeal with which she approacheth  Christ  is very remark∣able  Christ  was at Dinner in a Pharisee's House where we may observe by the way that  Christ  frequented Feasts and we do not find he was ever invited to any Table and refus'd it if a Pharisee or a Publican invited him he made no difficulty to go the end of his going in∣deed was not to Eat but to gain Souls to God and to fulfill the Will of his Father which was his  Meat  and  Drink  And at whose Table did  Jesus  ever Eat and left not the  Host  a Gainer When  Zachaeus  entertain'd him Salvation came  that Day to his House with the Author of it and now when this Pharisee en∣tertain'd him his Table was honour'd with the publick Remission of a Penitent Sinner But how comes this Woman to thrust her self into this Pharisee's House Certainly great was her Faith since no Disadvantage could affright her from coming to  Jesus  not the Frowns nor the Censure of a rigid Host who darted from his Eyes Disdain and Scorn seeing so notorious a  Strumpet  come to the Upper Chamber where he entertain'd his Company and that too in  Christ  's Presence who knew her wicked Life and no doubt was offended at her Action A  Pharisee  's House might have seem'd indeed an unlikely Place to find a  Saviour  in and it was very improper to serve in Tears at a Banquet Certainly the  Holy Spirit  mov'd on the Waters Doubtless this Woman had heard from our  Saviour  's Lips in his Heavenly Ser∣mons many gracious Invitations of all distress'd and sinburthen'd Souls and now at length she was entangl'd in the Net of his Heavenly Doctrine For our  Saviour  as St  Chrysostom  says hath two sorts of Nets a one of Wonders ano∣ther of Words in the former of these he caught those many that believ'd on  his Name by the latter he inclos'd his very Enemies even those very Officers that were sent to apprehend him and bring him before the  High Priest  and still doth our Blessed Saviour spin out the Thread of his Love to an infinite Length to try whether we will lay hold on it He doth angle for us he sits in  Heaven  lets down the Line of his Love and Baits it with his  Mercy  to see whe∣ther we will swallow it that he may catch our Souls with such a Hook was this Woman taken she had treasur'd up his Sayings in her Memory she had ob∣serv'd that he not only pardon'd Sinners but receiv'd them into his Presence she had observ'd the Passages of his Power and Mercy and a deep Remorse wrought in her self for her mispent Life and surely had not the Spirit of God wrought upon her ere she came she had neither sought nor found  Christ  For those good Graces which  God  finds in us are like the Silver which  Joseph  found in  Ben∣jamin  's Sack of his own putting in If his Hand does not move the golden  Cym∣bal  it will give no pleasant Sound for our Will herein is like a lower Sphere which receives its Motions from some first Mover And we may believe the  Holy Spirit  first breath'd and then that  Blast begat the Shower of Tears which  Mary  pour'd out for first Thus she be∣ing first mov'd by the  Spirit of God  comes in and finds  Christ  whom she sought she comes into his Presence not empty handed but with a precious Con∣fection of  Ointment  of  Nardus  the chief of all Ointments which she intended to bestow this delicate odoriferous Per∣fume she brings in as rich a Vessel a  Box of Alablaster  she used likewise a good  Decorum  she did not presently pour out her Ointment upon the Feet of  Jesus  but observing a decent Or∣der in her Repentance and in this her laudable Action first she gives the Sa∣crifice of a broken Heart she stood be∣hind at  Jesus  's Feet her Eyes suffici∣ently testified her godly Sorrow which dropp'd down Tears as fast as the  Ara∣bian  Trees their medicinal Gums She wept so plentifully that with those Streams of Penitence she began to wash his Feet and did wipe them with the Hairs of her Head to shew her Abje∣ction or Neglect of her self Thus cun∣ningly in Abasement of her self does this humble Penitent like the  Syrophe∣nitian  Woman like a Dog lick her Master's Feet at the Feet of  Christ  she makes a general Sacrifice of all those  Things wherewith she had offended him  Quot habuit in se oblectamenta tot de se fecit Holocausta  Peccavit meretrix oculis labrisque co∣misque  Inde luunt crimen lumina labra comae  Her Eyes her Lips her Hair her Ointment all the Instruments of her Sin were turn'd at her Conversion into the Means of Life as the  Israelites  that gave their Jewels to the making of a  Calf  did afterwards bestow them upon the  Lord's  Tabernacle such was this Woman's Practice who having now ta∣ken leave of her former Vanities and disrob'd her self of all her rich Orna∣ments does like an excellent  Apothe∣cary  that knows how to mix his Me∣dicines make a most soveraign  Antidote  out of a most deadly  Poison  She used to send forth her alluring Beams into the Eyes of the lascivious  Paramours  therefore from her Eyes flow a Deluge of Tears shallow enough to bear the Ark of her Sorrow she had made her Lips the Incitements to Lust and Inlets to Vanity but now they san∣ctifie themselves with their Respect to the  Son  of  God  her Hair which she had  so often curl'd at her Glass doth now serve for a Towel to dry his Feet her odoriferous Perfume wherewith she used to make her self acceptable to her amorous Companions she bestows on those sacred Feet which her Eyes had watered her Hair dried and her Mouth kissed And this strange Circumstance of her anointing was scarce done to any but  Christ  nor to him but by this Wo∣man It was esteemed so great an Exta∣sie of Love and Adoration that to a∣noint the Feet even of the greatest  Mo∣narch  was long unknown in all the Pomps and Greatness of the  Roman  Pro∣digality It was not us'd as  Pliny  says in his natural History till  Otho  taught it  Nero  in whose Instance it was by  Pliny  reckon'd for a Prodigy of unneces∣sary Profusion and in it self it was a Present for a  Prince  and  an Alablaster Box  of Nard Pistick was sent as a great Present from  Cambyses  to the King of  Aethiopia  But was the Oyntment so precious and she so poor that she could not bring a Napkin certainly she wanted not fine Linnen to have dry'd Christ's Feet with but to shew her hearty Devotion and sincere Humility her Shame her Tears her godly Sortow were not enough she  still seeks farther to make her self more vile and of no Price before  Christ  she her self is the Servant that waits on him from her self do fall the Dews of Water that wash his Feet and as her Eyes were the  Ewer  so her Hairs were the  Towel  using the chiefest Ornament of her Head in the meanest Office of our Saviour's Feet and thus she seems to climb up towards Heaven by the same Rounds of that Ladder by which she was formerly going down to Hell  When  Simon  the  Pharisee  observed this Woman so busy in the Expression of her  Religion  and Veneration of  Jesus  he thought within himself this was no  Prophet  that did not know her to be a  Sinner  and that would suffer her to touch him For altho' the  Jews  Reli∣gion did permit the Harlots of their own Nation to live and enjoy all the Privileges of their Nation except only that their Oblations were refus'd Yet the Pharisees who pretended to a greater Degree of Sanctity than others would not permit them to civil Usages or Be∣nefits of ordinary Society and thought Religion it self and the Honour of a Prophet was concern'd in the same Su∣perstitiousness And therefore  Simon  made an Objection within himself which  Jesus  knowing who understood his Thoughts as well as his Words made an Apology for her and himself by a civil Question express'd by way of Pa∣rable of two Debtors to whom a grea∣ter and a smaller Debt respectively was forgiven both of them concluding that they would love their merciful Creditor in Proportion to his Mercy which was  Mary Magdalen  's Case who because she had much forgiven loved much and express'd it in Characters so large that the  Pharisee  might read his own Inci∣vility and unhospitable Entertainment of the  Master  when it stood confron∣ted with the Magnificency of  Mary Mag∣dalen  's Charity and Penance the last of which she sufficiently express'd by her Tears  Such is  God  's Goodness that he hath placed in the Eye both the Disease and the Cure the Faculty of Seeing and the Sluce of Tears that they who of∣fend by Seeing may be recover'd by Weeping  Tears  are the Favourites that have the Ear of the  King  of  Hea∣ven  they are our Bills of  Exchange  which he allows and returns them with what Sums of Blessings we desire so long as we pay him this Type of our Devotion so long is our Tenure safe  and our Title to his Goodness and Mercy unquestionable  This Soveraign Water will recal a Sinner to the Life of Grace tho' never so far gone These heavenly Showers are the Streams of  Jordan  which cure our  Leprosie  the  Silim  to cure our Blind∣ness the  Bethesda  to heal our Lameness and Defects of Obedience never was the Poyson of any Sin so cold but the Hand of Repentance could thaw it never was the Flame of any Sin so hot but the Tears of Repentance could cool it  Magis frugiferae Lacrymantes vineae  The bleeding Heart like the dropping Vine is for the most Part fruitful I cannot here express my Thoughts of  Mary Magdalen  's Tears in a better Strain than that of the Poet  Magdala dum tristi vitiorum compede vincta  Solvendam Domini se jacet ante pedes  Quàm dulces fundit lacrymas quàm nobile flumen  Nascitur ex oculi divise fonte sui  Pactolus tali se vellet origire nasci  Vellet auriferi nobilis unda Tagi  Illi etenim solum voluunt sub fluctibus aurum  At fluit ex oculis plurima gemma suis  Her Ointment indeed was precious but her Tears were more so her Tears were her best Advocates to plead for Mercy at the Throne of Grace  Inter∣dum lacrymae pondera vocis habent  For sometimes Tears have as much Force as Words She spake not for she knew she was before one who knew the most retir'd Thoughts and most private De∣sires of her Soul what need her Tongue speak when her  Eyes  her  Hands  her  Gesture  her  Countenance  and her whole  Behaviour  spoke her Desires  Amongst other Things observable in the greater and more solemn Feasts of the  Jews  there were some  Ceremonies  used by them as Preparations to their Feasts which  Josephus  tells us were  Three First  Their  Salutation  which was shewn either by Words or some humble Posture of the Body sometimes by Prostrating their whole Body some∣times by Kissing the Feet as in this Pas∣sage and commonly by an ordinary Kiss of the Cheek as a Pledge of their wel∣come to their Guest The  Second  was the Washing of their Feet before they sat down to Eat The  Third  Compli∣ment was pouring Oil upon the Head In all which Observances  Simon  tho' of the formal Sect of the  Pharisees    was defective Insomuch that our  Sa∣viour  taxes him of this neglected Office in his Entertainment  Thou gavest me no Water for my Feet  c And well might the  Pharisee  read his own Fault in the Praise  Christ  gave of this Woman so well seen in the Customs of her Coun∣try in redoubling of her Kisses of an humble Thankfulness on those Sacred Feet  To Repent then is to Kiss the Feet of  Jesus  and it is all one to be sorry for our Sins and to love  him  this is confirm'd by our  Saviour  's Words who denomi∣nates this whole Action from  Love Christ  says not she  wept  much she  sor∣row'd  much but she  lov'd  much and by all means she sought to express her great Love which great Mercy rais'd For nothing she had was too dear with her most precious and fragrant Ointment she anointed our  Saviour  's Feet that rich and costly Testimony of her Love she bestow'd freely for she did not  drop  but  pour  not a  Dram  or  two  but a  whole Pound  not reserving any but breaking the Box and pouring it all out What went before was the Sacrifice of a broken Heart with that first Sacrifice she ador'd the Divinity of  Christ  this last she tendreth to his Humanity The  first Shower of her Tears were Tears of  Sorrow  and  Repentance  the latter which overtook the first were Tears of  Joy  and  Love  And so pleasing to  Christ  were all the Actions of this perfect Pe∣nitent that he not only defended her against the  Pharisee  in preferring her Kindness to the Entertainment of his House but against  Satan  and the Powers of Hell in forgiving her many Sins with∣out any Enumeration of them This is the Substance of what passed betwixt  Jesus  and  Mary Magdalen  in the Pha∣risee's House but I cannot leave this happy Convert there but must follow her to  Bethany  to see her Comport∣ment there and at our  Saviour  's Death and after that at his Resurrection  Jesus  having left  Jerusalem  in the d Year of his Publick Ministry after he had Wept over it he came to  Bethany  where he met with another sort of Re∣ception than he had at the  Holy City  there he Supped where  Martha  making great Preparations for his Entertainment to express her Joy and Affection to his Person desir'd  Jesus  to dismiss her Si∣ster  Mary  from his Feet who sate there Feasting her self with the Food of An∣gels the Words of God unmindful of providing for his Entertainment But  Jesus  commended her Choice and tho' he did not expresly refuse  Martha  's Ci∣vility yet he preferr'd  Mary  's Religion Here  Mary Magdalen  who had spent before one Box of  Nard Pistick  upon our  Lord  's Feet as a Sacrifice for her Conversion now bestow'd another in Thankfulness in restoring her Brother  Lazarus  to Life and consign'd her  Lord  to his Burial and here too she met with an evil Interpreter  Judas  an  Apostle  one of  Christ  's own Family pretended it had been better to have given it to the Poor but it was  Malice  and the Spirit of Envy that spoke not Religion For he that sees an Action well done and seeks to undervalue it by telling how it might have been done better reproves nothing but his own Spirit For a Man may do very well and  God  will accept it tho' to say he might have done bet∣ter is to say only that Action was not the most absolute and perfect in it's Kind but the End of that Man best shew'd his present Meaning and at the best it could be no other than a rash Judgment of the Action and Intent of  Mary Magdalen  and by his declaiming against her he made tacite Reflections upon his  Lord  for suffering it and yet it is not intima∣ted  in the History of the Life of  Jesus  that  Judas  had any Malice against the Person of  Christ  for when afterwards he saw the Matter was to end in the Death of the Lord he repented but a base unworthy Spirit of Covetousness possess'd him and the Relicks of Indig∣nation for missing the Price of the Oint∣ment burnt in his Bowels with a secret dark melancholy Fire and broke out into an Action which all Ages of the World could never Parallel  To what end was this waste of Ointment  says  Judas for it might have been sold for more than Three hundred Pence and been given to the Poor  but  Jesus  said  Let her alone why trouble you her she hath wrought a good work on me  As this was well intended it was well taken by  Christ  and approv'd of by all present except  Judas  who liking his own Gain better than any Scent in the  Apothecaries  Shop seeing that spent on his Master's Head which he wish'd in his own Purse grumbled at it and that with so colourable a Pretence that it was a needless Expence a Waste and that it might have been bestow'd much better for the Relief of the  Poor  as that  Judas  drew some of the  Disciples  to favour the Motion and to dislike  Mary Magdalen  and her Action so that both they and he joyn'd in one Bill but he of wretched Covetousness of Mind and they of a simple plain Intent and Purpose thinking all that was well∣spoken was wellmeant so that the Action was not brought only against her that bestow'd it but against  Christ  that admitted it Whereupon he pleads her Cause not only excusing her but com∣mending it as a good Work And yet the Ointment was not so pleasing to his Sense as her Gratitude was to his Spirit for he then declar'd that the Ointment which fill'd the House with the Scent should fill the whole World with the Report of it and as far as the Gospel should be preach'd so far should the Remembrance of her Action reach as well for her Commendation as for our Imitation  Thus we see Things well done are oftentimes ill taken and often good In∣tentions want good Constructions No Person had such Experience of this as  Mary Magdalen  The Scripture records three several Virtues of hers and in each of them she was murmur  d at When in the Bitterness of her Soul she shew'd her Repentance by Tears  Simon  the  Pha∣risee  did what he could to Disgrace her  When sitting at  Christ  's Feet  Martha  her Sister complain'd of her to  Christ  and now here again the third Time when in an honest regard of her Duty she's shewing her Thankfulness for Com∣fort receiv'd  Christ  's own Disciple speaks against her So that if she washes  Christ  's Feet with Tears it contents not if she anoints his Head with Balm its Matter of Displeasure and if she Sits still and says nothing 'tis all one still  Mary Magdalen  is in Fault her Doings ever stand awry This is the Fortune of all that follow her Steps even  Christ  himself could neither have his Feet a∣nointed but  Simon  the  Pharisee  nor his Head anointed but  Judas  his Apo∣stle speaks against it  But we must not leave  Mary Mag∣dalen  here for notwithstanding these great Discouragements and Rebukes which she receiv'd from  Judas  and some of the Disciples she neglected not her Duty nor left her  Lord  till his Death for loving  Christ  more than her Life she followed him in his Journey to his Death attending him when his Disci∣ples fled being more willing to Die with him than to Live without him She was last at his Cross and first at his Grave staid longest there and was  soonest here she could not rest till she was up to seek him sought him before the Day lighted her she stood by the Grave where faint Love uses not to  stand  we bring our Friends to the Grave and there leave them but come no more at it nor stay longer by it but  Mary Magdalen  did and she only and none but she as we shall see by the Se∣quel of this Discourse  We find in the whole Tenour of the  Gospel  that God observes a mixture of much spiritual Power and Glory with much outward Meanness The Gospel is call'd a rich Treasure in an earthen Vessel the Mystery conveyed is preci∣ous but the Means of Conveyance mean and contemptible The whole Mystery of  Christ  is made up of Power and Meekness his Conception was by the Holy Ghost of a pure Virgin but the outside Mean his Blessed Mother an Earthen Vessel the Spouse of a poor  Carpenter  his Birth publish'd by an Angel but discover'd first to poor Shep∣herds his Lodging pointed out by a Star and yet his Cradle but a Manger his Nursery but a Stable Being in the Wilderness he was attended by Angels but see the poor Outside he was a∣mongst wild Beasts in his Agony he  was full of Trembling and Horror but then he receiv'd Comfort from Heaven by an Angel at his Death he was Cru∣cified with Thieves but yet the Powers of  Heaven  and  Earth  trembled at it The Tidings of his Resurrection were told by an Angel but spread through the World by poor weak Women Had Flesh and Blood had the Management of the News of his Resurrection it would have been first publish'd to the College of the  Apostles  and St  Peter  should have had the first Intelligence by a Vision of Angels directed to him Kings and Princes make known their Minds to inferior People by their  Great Officers  and  Ministers  but the  Court of Heaven  takes other Measures  God  em∣ploys poor and in the Eye of the World contemptible Men to declare his Will to the  Potentates  of the World And this was the grand Objection made by the mistaken  Pagans  to  Christ  and his Disciples that  Christianity  was set on foot by such abject and mean Persons as  Christ  made choice of but that which begat in them Contempt and Scorn ought to fill us with Wonder and Admiration  And to make Amends for that Ob∣servation that no good Angel ever as∣sum'd the Likeness of a Woman here  are Women of whom  M Magdalen  was chief made Angels  i e  as the original signifies  Messengers  and  Pub∣lishers  of the greatest Mystery of our Religion for  M Magdalen  with other devout Women who not considering the Resurrection of  Christ  went with a pious Intention to do an Office of Re∣spect and Honour to the Body of their Master which they meant to embalm in the Tomb where they thought to have found it there was  God  the  God  of Life dead and laid in a Grave and here was  Man  a  dead Man  risen out of the Grave here are  Angels  of  Heaven  employed in so low an Office as to in∣struct Women and Women employ'd in so high an Office as to instruct the  Apostles  here are  angelical  Women and  evangelical Angels  Angels made  Evan∣gelists  to preach the Gospel and  Women  made  Angels  to be  Instructors  of the  Church  Now tho' it has been doubted whe∣ther the  blessed Virgin  was there when this pass'd at the Sepulcher yet that  Mary Magdalen  and  Mary  the Mother of  James  and  Salmone  were there is cer∣tain  They came to embalm the Body of Jesus for the Rights of embalming a∣mongst  the  Jews  us'd to last  forty Days  and their Love was not satisfy'd with what  Joseph  had done but herein they were very inconsiderate for that was only done upon such Bodies as were ex∣tenerated and embowell'd and then fill'd up and plaister'd about with Spices and Gumms to preserve them from Pu∣trefaction when they were to be carried into remote Parts but of these reem∣balmings after the Body had been laid in the Sepulcher I never read neither seems it to have been possible for these Women to have come at the Body of  Christ  And by the Windingsheet of  Christ  which is kept in  Savoy  it appears that that Sheet stuck so close to the Body as that it did and does still retain the Demensions of his Body and the Im∣pressions and Marks of every Wound that he receiv'd in his Body so that it would have been no easie Matter for these Women to have pull'd off that Sheet if it had been fasten'd to his Bo∣dy with nothing but his Blood But if as some Authors say his Body was car∣ried loose in the Sheet which is shew'd in  Savoy  from the Cross to the Sepul∣cher and then taken out of that Sheet and embalmed by  Nicodemus  and wrapp'd up in other Linnen upon those  Spices  and  Gums  which he bestow'd up∣on it and then buried according to the Manner of the  Jews  whose Custom it was to swath the Bodies of the Dead as we do Children all over for so  La∣zarus  came out bound Hand and Foot with Gravecloaths how could these Women think to embalm the Body of  Jesus  so swath'd and bound up as that Body was for certainly it was the Bo∣dy not the Gravecloaths they meant to embalm and it seems strange that no one has touch'd upon this Doubt All Expositors make good Use of their Piety and devout Care of their dead Master but of the Impossibility of their coming to the Body of the Irregularity of their Undertaking that and proceeding so far in that which could not possibly be done there is no mention Indeed  Cry∣sologus  says  saeva passionis procella tur∣baverat that a bitter Storm of Passion and Consternation had so disorder'd them as that no Faculty of theirs could per∣form their right Function praefervose caecutiebant  Earnestness had so discom∣pos'd and amaz'd them as they discern'd nothing clearly nor did nothing order∣ly Another inconsiderate Action of these Women was the removing the Stone of the  Sepulcher  for they had pre∣par'd  their Gumms and were on the way to the  Sepulcher  before they thought of that then they stop and say one to another  who shall roll away the Stone from the  Sepulcher Yet they still go on and their Love answers the Objection not knowing how it should be done but yet resolving to go through all Difficulties but never think how they should pass the Guard that was set at the Tomb But when they came there they found the Guard affrighted and re∣mov'd and the Stone roll'd away for a little before they arriv'd there had been a great  Earthquake  and an  Angel  descending from  Heaven  had roll'd a∣way the Stone and sate upon it with the Terror of his Appearance and the Earthquake the Soldiers were asto∣nish'd and were like dead Men and some of them ran to the  HighPriest  and told what had happen'd Hereup∣on the Women finding the Door o∣pen enter'd into the  Sepulcher  and missing the Body of  Jesus M Magda∣len  ran to the  Eleven Apostles  com∣plaining that the Body of our  Lord  was not to be found they thought this Story the Product of a weak and frightned Fancy however  Peter  and  John  ran as fast as they could to see for the Un∣expectedness  of the Relation the Won∣  f the Story and the Sadness of the  n mov'd them They presently  ed to the Garden but  John  being  ounger and the nimbler outran  ompanion and came first thither  e he only peep'd but went not in  r out of a Fear in himself or a great  rence to our  Saviour Peter  tho'  d in the way was before in his  and being older and more consi∣  e came and resolutely enter'd in∣  e  Sepulcher  where he found no∣  but the Linnen Cloaths lying to∣  er in one Place and the Napkin  ad been about his Head wrapp'd  her in another which being dis∣  d with so much Care and Order  'd that our  Saviour  's Body was not  n away by Thieves as the Jews  d have it who use to be more care∣  consulting their own Safety and  pe than of leaving things orderly  s'd behind them  y this time  M Magdalen  was come  again to the  Sepulcher  where the  r Women had stay'd for her and  the  Angel  speaks to them and  s them of another gross Absurdity  ebukes them for it  Why seek ye the  g amongst the dead  Why him who  is the Son of the living God the Prince of Life who hath Life in himself and who is Life it self amongst the Tombs of dead Mortals What makes you think of arming him with Gumms against Pu∣trefaction who told you before he was not subject to Corruption but would rise again  M Magdalen  also fell into such another Error For when the  Angel  had told her at the Sepulcher  He is not here for He is risen as he said  yet when she came running to  Peter  she said no∣thing of the  Resurrection  never thought of that but pour'd her self out in that Lamentation  they have taken away our Lord  Whereas if she had consider'd she must necessarily have known from the Angel's Words that no Man had taken away the  Lord  that no Man had laid him any where else but that by his own Power he was risen But as in this Storm of Passion they left  Christ  's Promise that he would rise unconsider'd never remember'd the rolling of the Stone from the Door of the Sepulcher nei∣ther did they consider the Impossibility of coming to  Christ  's Body to do the Office they intended Their Devotion was awake but their Consideration was not so however they did not lose all the Benefits of their pious and devout  Intention for the  Angel  did not forbear to comfort them with  Do not ye fear  Let them continue in Fear that remain in Unbelief and have no God to com∣fort themselves in Let those mercena∣ry Soldiers that are hir'd to watch the Sepulcher fear and never recover but why should  You  fear who see none but us your FellowCitizens in the Service of God if your Conversation be in Hea∣ven as it is if you do truly seek that  Jesus  who is risen that he might go thi∣ther  It seems the other Women who came with  M Magdalen  and stay'd till  Peter  and  John  had been there to make Trial of  M Magdalen  's Report as they were speedy in coming and diligent in search∣ing  Christ  so they were in haste to be gone when they could not find him and fearful of farther seeking and their Departure commends  M Magdalen  's staying behind To the Grave she came before them from the Grave she went to tell them thither she returns with them and there she stays behind them a stronger Affection fix'd her and so fix'd her that she had not Power to re∣move thence  To stay whilst Company stays that is the  World  's Love but  Peter  is gone  and  John  is gone and the  Women  are gone and she left alone and to stay a∣lone shews constant Love She stood and wept she wish'd to find  Christ  and therefore wept for his Absence whom she dearly lov'd whilst she had him she bitterly bewail'd him she thought lost and having lost the Sight of her Life she desir'd to dwell in the dark chusing  Christ  's Tomb for her best home and there stood weeping she abandon'd the Living for the Company of the Dead and now it seems that even the dead have forsaken her since the Body she seeks is taken away from her It was Love in∣duc'd her to stand and Sorrow forc'd her to weep her Eye was watchful to seek whom her Heart most lov'd to en∣joy and her Feet in a Readiness to run if her Eye could chance to espye him But as she watch'd to find her lost Lord she wept for having lost whom she had lov'd for as first she mourn'd for the Departure of his Soul out of his Body so now she lamented the taking his Body out of the Grave for tho' her first Sorrow was because she could not enjoy him  alive  yet she hop'd at least to have found him  dead  to which purpose she had prepar'd her  Spices  and provided her  Oyntments  to  pay him the last Duties And tho'  Joseph  and  Nicodemus  had already bestow'd a hundred Pound of Myrrhe and Aloes which was as well apply'd as Art and Devotion could desire yet such was her Love that she would have thought a∣ny Quantity too little without the Ad∣dition of her own she came therefore now intending to embalm his Corps as she had before anointed his Feet and as in the Spring of her Felicity she had washed his Feet with her Tears bewailing unto him the Death of her own Soul so now she came in the Depth of her Misery to shed them again for the Death of his Body But when she saw the Grave open'd and the Body gone the Labour of embalming was prevented But the Cause of her Tears increas'd and tho' she found no Use for the Spices yet she found how to employ her Tears now as much afflicted for his Loss as be∣fore she had been pleas'd at his Presence But since weeping without searching was to no Purpose her weeping hin∣der'd not her Inquiry her Sorrow dull'd not her Diligence she often stoop'd and look'd into the Grave but why should she now look in since  Peter  had been in the Tomb and  John  had look'd in before However she will not trust  either  Peter  's or  John  's Eyes nay she will not trust her self she will suspect her own Senses she will rather think she look'd not well before than leave off looking And thus hoping in Despair and despairing in Hope she stood at the  Sepulcher  without fear because she thought now nothing left that ought to be fear  d But with what Hope or with what Heart could she stand alone at the Tomb when the Disciples were gone for her Eyes had seen and  Peter  's Hands had felt that the  Lord  was not there the empty Windingsheet did also confirm it and yet nothing could make her be∣lieve it her disappointed Love had drown'd both her Mind and Memory so deep in Sorrow and so amaz'd her Senses by his Absence that all remem∣brance of his former Promises was di∣verted with the Crowd of present Trou∣bles for doubtless had she remember'd him as she should have done she would not have thought the Tomb a fit Place to seek him in neither would she have mourn'd for him as dead and remov'd by the Treachery of others but joy'd in him as reviv'd by his own Power but Sorrow had quite stupify'd her Senses distemper'd her Thoughts discourag'd her Hopes awak'd her Passions and left  her no other liberty than to weep she wept therefore and as she was weep∣ing she stoop'd down and look'd into the  Sepulcher  and saw two Angels in White one at the Head and the other at the Feet where the Body of  Jesus  had been laid Angels in a Grave a strange Sight never seen before That sure was a Place fitter for Worms than Angels They were in White too a Co∣lour expressive of Joy  Heaven  mourn'd at his  Passion  the Eclipse of that Day shew'd them all in Black but at the  Re∣surrection  they rejoyce they are now all in White even the Heavens and Angels They were sitting the one at the Head the other at the Feet which may be re∣ferr'd to  Mary Magdalen  's having anoin∣ted his Head and his Feet they sat at these two Places as it were to acknow∣ledge so much for her Sake Between the  Angels  there was no striving for Places he that sat at the  Feet  was as well con∣tented as he that sat at the  Head  but with us both Angels would have been at the Head never a one at the Feet  And they said unto her Woman why weepest thou  They ask'd her Why she wept believing she had no Cause all was in Error Tears of Grief but false Grief imagining him to be dead that was  alive she wept because she found the Grave empty which God forbid she should have found full for then  Christ  must have been dead still for want of Belief in his Resurrection she believ'd he was carried away she err'd in so be∣lieving there was Error in her  Love  but there was Love in her Error and it was a great Argument of her Love to call him  Lord  after he had suffer'd the most opprobrious and ignominious Death such as would have made many blush to own him  When she look'd first she saw no An∣gel and then of a sudden looking down she saw two yet the suddenness and gloriousness of the Sight mov'd her not at all she seem'd to have no Sense of it but wept on which was strange for here methinks her good Fortune exceeds her Hopes and where her last Sorrow was bred her first Succour arises for she sought but one and she found two one dead Body was the Cause of her Errand and she found two alive her Weeping was for a Man and her Tears have found Angels who invite her to a Parly and seem to pity her Case They sit at the Tomb to shew they are no Strangers to her Loss they spake to her as tho' they had some special Message to  deliver to her and if she had ask'd them concerning her Master they were the likeliest to give her a satisfactory An∣swer and to have told her the Cause of their coming and the Reason of her  Lord  's remove but nothing could move her to admit Comfort or to entertain any Company for having vow'd her self to  Christ  alone except to him she will neither lend her Ear nor borrow others Help Besides whatever they could tell her if they told her not of him and whatsoever they told her of him if they told her not where he was both their telling and her hearing were but a wasting of Time for she came not thither to see Angels but him who made both her and them and to whom she ow'd more than to Men and Angels and being full of wavering Uncertain∣ties and perplex'd Thoughts she be∣gan to think if she staid there by the Tomb where he was not she should never find him and if she would go farther to seek she knew not whither to part with the Tomb was Death to her and to stand helpless by it would do no good so that all her Comfort was that she must either stay there with∣out Help or go without Hope Then she blam'd her self for leaving him when  she had him thus to lament him now she had lost him and for departing when it was time to stay and returning when it was too late to Help forget∣ting what her Master used to say when he told her  He would rise again the third Day  But why doth she torment her self with these tragical Surmises Does she think the  Angels  would sit still if their  God  were not well did they serve him after his Fasting and would they despise him after his Decease If in the Garden he might have had Twelve Legions of An∣gels as he said Is his Power so gone with the Life of his Body that he could not now Command them Was there an Angel found to help  Daniel  to his Dinner to save  Toby  from the Fish and to defend  Balaam  's poor Beast from his Master's Rage And is the  Lord  of  An∣gels  of so little Concern that if his Body wanted it no Angel would defend it But she saw two there to Honour his  Tomb  and how much more careful would they be to do Homage to his Person She might well think they would not Smile if she had just Occa∣sion to Weep they would not so glori∣ously sit in white if a black and mourn∣ing Weed did better become them  But why did her Sorrow question so much about the Place where they had laid her  Lord  might not she better sup∣pose that he was in  Paradise  for since he came to repair  Adam  's Ruins and to be the  common Parent  of our Redem∣ption as  Adam  was of our Original In∣fection 'twas reasonable that having en∣dur'd all his Life the Penalty of  Adam  's Exile he should after Death reenter upon a Possession of that Inheritance which  Adam  lost And besides if her Sorrow at the Cross had not made her as Deaf as at the Tomb it made her Forgetful she could not but have re∣member'd what he himself said to one of the  Thieves That the same Day he should be with him in  Paradise  Whilst  Mary Magdalen  thus lost her self in a Labyrinth of Doubts mixing Tears with her Words and warming them with Sighs she saw the Angels with a kind of Reverence as tho' they had done Honour to one behind her whereupon she turn'd back and saw  Je∣sus  standing but knew not that it was  him  For when  Jesus  saw that nothing would give her Comfort but himself that no  Angels  no Sight no Speech of others would serve then her  Lord  comes and from seeking him dead she  finds him alive but first he comes un∣known stands by her and she did not suspect that it was he she not only knew not that 'twas  Jesus  but mistook him for the  Gardiner  Proper enough it was and fitted well with the Time and Place it was the Spring and in a Garden and she did not mistake in taking him for a  Gardiner  tho' she might seem to err in some Sense yet in another Sense she was in the right For in a Spiritual Sense  Christ  may be said to be a Gar∣diner for of the first the fairest Garden that ever was  Paradise  he was the Gar∣diner it was of his Planting and ever since it is he that makes all our  Gardens  Green sends us Yearly the Spring and all the  Herbs  and  Flowers  we gather in the Season And 'tis he that gardens our Souls too and weeds out of them whatsoever is prejudicial to or destru∣ctive of his Word sown in our Hearts He sows them with the true Roots of all  Christian Virtues  waters them with the Dew of his Grace and makes them bring forth Fruit to  Eternal Life  Besides all this Christ on the Day of his Resurrection was most properly a Gar∣diner and that a strange One who made such an Herb grow out of the Ground that Day as the like was never seen be∣fore  except in the Instance of  Laza∣rus  rais'd by him a dead Body to shoot forth alive from the Grave  But was it possible that  Mary Magda∣len  could forget  Jesus  whose Faith had fix'd him in her Understanding her Love in her Will both Fear and Hope in her Memory for him her Eye weeps her Thoughts greive her whole  Body  fainteth her Soul languisheth and there was no Part of her that was not busie about him and yet she had forgotten him his Countenance and Voice assure her his Words witness it her Eyes be∣hold him and yet she knew him not But there was such a Shower of Tears between her and him and her Eyes were so dimm'd with weeping for him that tho' she saw the Man she could not discern  Jesus  and therefore as he seems to her a Stranger he asketh the same Question of her which the Angels had only quickens it a little with  Woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou  If she seeks  Christ  why knows she him not and if she knows him why does she seek him whom she sees It is a common thing with us to seek a Thing and when we have found it not to know we have  Scarce three Days ago she saw him hanging on a Tree with his Head crown'd with Thorns his Eyes full of Sorrow his Ears fill'd with Blasphemies his Mouth fed with Gall his whole Person mangled and disfigur'd his Arms and Legs rack'd with violent Pulls his Hands and Feet boar'd with Nails his Side wounded with a Spear his whole Body torn with Scourges and goar'd with Blood and yet Christ asketh her  Why she weeps  and not without Cause doth he ask this Question because she would have  Christ  alive and yet wept because she did not find him dead She was sorry he was not there and for that very Cause she should rather have been glad for if he were Dead she might have expected to see him there but his not being there was a sign he was Alive But she still taking  Jesus  to be the Gardiner said unto him  If thou hast carried him from hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away  To ask  Christ  for  Christ  seems somewhat strange which however it falls out in other Matters here it was safe even when we seek  Christ  to pray  Christ  to help us to find  Christ  for we cannot come to him ex∣cept he draws us But  Mary Magdalen  seems something more harsh to  Christ  than to the Angels to them she com∣plains of  others  saying  they  have taken him away But she seems to charge  Christ  at least to suspect him of the Fact as if he had look'd like one that had been a Robber of Graves her  if  im∣plies as much but Love as it fears where it need not so it suspects without Cause But St  Bernard  speaks to  Christ  for her  Domine amor quem habebat in Te dolor quem habebat de Te excusat eam apud Te si fortè erravit circa Te  The Love she bore him the Sorrow she had for him may excuse her if she were in any Error concerning him in her say∣ing  Si sustulisti  Her Affections seem to transport her as she says no Man knows what to one a meer Stranger to her and she to him she talks to one thrice under the Name of him if thou hast taken him tell me where thou hast laid him and I will fetch him alas poor Woman she was not able to lift him there goes more than one or two either to the carrying of a Corps as for his it had more than a Hundred Pound weight of Myrrh and other Odours up∣on it  She charged not the Angels with his Removal nor seem'd to mistrust them for she did not request them to inform  her where he was laid but now she judgeth the Gardiner to be the Author of her Loss being almost fully persua∣ded that he was privy to the Place and acquainted with the Action and tho' she was not altogether in the right yet she was not much in the wrong and err'd with such aim that she miss'd very little of the Truth  But since she was so desirous to know where  Jesus  lay Why did not she name him when she ask'd for him She says only she will take  Him  away her Cou∣rage seems above the Strength of a Wo∣man neither does she remember that all Women are weak she promiseth without Condition she makes no Ex∣ception as if nothing were impossible that her Love suggesteth It was indeed wonderful that  Love  had so bereav'd her of Sense that tho' she saw the An∣gels she could not see  Jesus  She sought for one whom when she had found she knew not and not knowing him when she found him she sought for him when she had him But alas how could poor  Mary  believe that after her  Lord  had liv'd so long labour'd so much died with such Pain and shed such showers of Blood he should come to no higher a Preferment than to be a  Gardiner    Was a sorry Garden the best Inheri∣tance her Love could have imagin'd for him or a  Gardiner  's Office the highest Dignity she could allow him It had been better he had liv'd to have been  Lord  of her Castle of  Magdalen  than with his Death so dearly to have purchas'd so mean a Post  But her Mistake hath in it a farther Mystery tho' her Sight was deceiv'd she thought not amiss For as our first Father in his State of Innocence was plac'd in a Garden of Pleasure and his first Office was that of a  Gardiner  so the first Man that ever was in  Glory  appear'd first in a Garden and presented himself in the likeness of a  Gardiner  that the beginning of Glory might re∣semble that of Innocence and Grace And as that  Gardiner  was the foil of Mankind the Parent of Sin and Au∣thor of Death so this was the Raiser of our Ruins the Ransom of our Offence and the Restorer of Life In a  Garden  Man was deceiv'd and ensnar'd by the Devil In a Garden  Christ  was betray'd and apprehended by the  Jews  In a Garden  Adam  was condemn'd to eat his Bread in the Sweat of his Brows And after a FreeGift of the Bread of Angels in the last Supper  Christ  did  earn it us with a  Bloody Sweat  of his whole Body And as by Disobedient eating the Fruit of a  Tree  our Right to the Garden of Paradise was forfeited by  Adam  so by the Obedient Death of  Christ upon a Tree  a far better Right is now settled And as when  Adam  sinn'd in the Garden of Paradise he was then apparell'd in the Skin of a dead Beast that his Cloathing might betoken his Grave and his Livery of Death agree with his Condemnation to Die so to defray the Debt of that Sin in this Garden  Christ  lay clad in the dead Man's Shrowd and buried in his Tomb that as our Evils began so they might end and such Places and Means as were the Premises of our Misery might be also the end of our Misfortune and for these Reasons  Mary Magdalen  was allow'd to mistake that we might be inform'd of the Mystery and see how aptly the Course of our Redemption did answer the Process of our Condemnation  But why could not  Mary Magdalen  as well see what in truth Christ was as what in show he seem'd to be but she thought so to have found him as she left him and she sought him as she saw him last being so overcome with Sorrow for his Death that she had neither room  nor respite in her Mind for any hope of his Life and therefore she ask'd the  Gardiner If thou hast carried him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him  But one would be ready to think her Master was very unkind to leave her so long without Comfort and to punish her so much who so well deserv'd Pardon She did not follow the Tide of his bet∣ter Fortune to shift sail with the Stream she left him not in his lowest Ebb she revolted not from his last Extremity in his Life she serv'd him with her Goods in his Death she departed not from his Cross and after Death she came to dwell with him in his Grave  But now  Christ  begins to take Pity on her her Tears were too mighty Orators to let her Suit fall tho' they pleaded at the most rigorous Bar they tie the Tongues of all Accusers and soften the rigour of the severest Judge they win the Invincible and bind the Omnipo∣tent when they seem most Pittiful they have the greatest Power and being most Forsaken they are more Victorious For this Water her Heart had been long a Limbeck sometimes distilling it from the Weeds of her own Offences with the true Fire of Contrition sometimes  of the Flowers of Spiritual Comforts with the Flames of Contemplation and at other times out of the bitter Herbs of her Master's Miseries with the Heat of a tender Compassion Her Tears that were heretofore the  Proctors  for her Brother's Life were now the Invi∣ters of those Angels in the Monument for her Comfort and the Suiters that shall be rewarded with the first Sight of her reviv'd Saviour For when Christ saw all was in vain that neither Men nor Agels nor himself so long as he kept himself a  Gardiner  could get any Thing out of her but that her Lord was gone he was taken away and that nothing but  Jesus  could yield her any Comfort He is no longer able to contain but even discloses himself and that by his Voice And now  Christ  is found alive that was sought Dead A Cloud may be so thick as to hide the Sun from our Sight the Sun must scatter that Cloud and then we may see its Light Here is an Example of it A thick Cloud of Heaviness had so obscured  Mary Magdalen  's Eyes that she could not see him thro' it this one word these two Syllables  Mary  from his Mouth dispels all the Darkness no sooner had his Voice sounded in her Ears but it drove away all the Mist dries up  her Tears opens her Eyes and she knows him and answer'd him with her wonted Salutation  Rabboni  Thus the  Gardiner  did his Part brought  Mary Magdalen  from a dead and drooping to a lively and cheerful Estate She sought  Christ  dead and imprison'd in a StonyGrave and finds him both alive and at full li∣berty She sought him in a Shroud more like a Leper than himself left as the Model of the utmost Misery and the only Pattern of the bitterest Unhappi∣ness and now she finds him invested with Robes of Glory the Owner and Giver of all Felicity She that had so long sought without finding wept with∣out Comfort and call'd without Answer is now fully satisfied with this one word  Mary  having heard him call her in his wonted Manner and usual Voice this one word restor'd her Senses enlighten'd her Mind quicken'd her Heart and re∣viv'd her Soul  But why did  Christ  chuse to be made known to her by the Ear rather than by the Eye by Hearing rather than by Appearing because her Eyes were hol∣den till her Ears were open'd The Philosophers tell us  Hearing  is the Sense of Wisdom and in Matters of Faith the  Ear  goes first and is of more use and  to be trusted before the  Eye  No sooner had  Christ  's Voice sounded in her Ears but she knew forthwith it was he and being ravish'd with his Voice and im∣patient of Delays a sudden Joy so over∣prest her by so unexpected a Presence and so many Miracles laid at once before her that she could no more proceed in her own than give  Christ  leave to go forward with his Speech but falling at his sacred Feet she offer'd to bath them with Tears of Joy and to kiss his late  grievous  but now  most glorious  Wounds But Christ forbad her saying  Touch me not  This seem'd a strange Rebuke to  Mary  who when dead in Sin she touch'd his mortal Feet and now being alive in Grace she was denied to touch his glo∣rious Feet being commanded from that for which she was before commended by our  Saviour  Alas What Harm had there been if he had suffer'd her to touch him Before his Passion many desir'd and strove to touch him and there went Virtue out of him even while he was  Mortal  but now he was  Immortal  in all likelihood much more Virtue would pro∣ceed Christ was not used to be so ten∣der of being touch'd at several Times and Places he suffer'd the rude Multitude to crowd and thrust him and much ruder  Touches at his Passion Why suffer'd he them  then  and why suffer'd he not her  now  she had touch'd before both his Head and his Feet and anointed them both and she now brought Odours in her Hand to Reembalm him It was early and yet by that time she had given very good Proofs of her Love She was early up came first to the Grave return'd and call'd  Peter  and  John  staid last at the Grave had been at such Cost taken such Pains had wept so much as to refuse Comfort even when offer'd by Angels till she had found  Christ  she was a Stranger to Consola∣tion and now having found him that she must not touch him seems very hard one poor Touch had been but an easie Recompence for all her Pains and Sorrow But if we look into the Rea∣son  Christ  gives it is yet more strange  Touch me not for I am not yet ascen∣ded  as if he had said when he was Ascended then she should but if stand∣ing upon Earth by him he is not to be touch'd when he is taken up in∣to Heaven no Arm can reach him there  There is a Time and Place for  No∣li me tangere  The World began with a  Noli me tangere  The first Words  God spake then were  Touch not the forbidden Fruit  But Christ is not the forbidden Tree but the Tree of Life to be touch'd and tasted that we may live by him but this  touch me not  was not on  Christ  's Part but on  Mary  's no Lett in him to be touch'd the Lett was in her she might not touch him would  Christ  have Men to touch him and not Wo∣men for St  Thomas  put his whole Hand into the Place of his Wounds and put him to no Pain at all and certain  Wo∣men  met him in the way after his Resur∣rection amongst which was  M Magdalen  and he then suffer'd them to touch him and take him by the Feet So that it seems this Prohibition was not Real but Personal not absolutely but not at that time which shews all was not well with  M Magdalen  something was amiss she must have been to blame in the Manner of her Offer she must have been a little too forward it may be and not have us'd all the Respect she should have done For as soon as  Christ  cry'd  Mary  she answer'd with her wonted Term  Rabboni  and as she saluted him with her usual Word so after her Custom she went towards him and would have touch'd him not in such a Manner as was fitting to be ob∣serv'd nor with that Regard which his  new glorified Estate seem'd justly to re∣quire for that which was enough to  Christ  a few Days past was not so now She poor Woman was defective in her Judgment out of an Excess of her Affe∣ction she thought he had been  Rabboni  still It seem'd to her that  Christ  was now as her Brother  Lazarus  was after his Re∣surrection that  Christ  had risen neither more nor less but just the same he was be∣before to be saluted approach'd and touched as formerly he had been  It seems she was not before so carry'd away with Sorrow but she was now as far gone in the other of Joy and so for∣got her self in offering to touch him no otherwise than she did before Her Case was like St  Peter  's in the Mount who knew not what he said when he pro∣pos'd the building of three Tabernacles she knew not what she did being so sur∣pris'd with the sudden Joy as she had no Leisure to recollect her self to weigh the wonderful great Change this Day wrought in him For when her Judgment was better settled she did touch him but then it was upon her Knees down at his Feet another manner of Gesture than as it seems she first offer'd  'Tis true he gave St  Thomas  leave to touch whose Faith was in his Fingers  Ends he then believ'd not was in Doubt thought he had been a Ghost and to clear that Doubt he was suffer'd to touch him St  Thomas  and  M Magdalen  or whoe∣ver touch'd  Christ  on Earth if they had not been more happy to touch him with their  Faith  than with their  Hands  they had receiv'd no Good at all by it it was much better with Faith to touch the Hemm of his Garment than without it to touch any Part of his Body touching was the proper Cure for St  Thomas  's Di∣sease but so it was not for  M Magda∣len  who was sure the Voice she heard was that of  Rabboni  she had no need to be confirm'd in that Her Disease was of another Sort not want of Faith but want of due Regard  Thomas  touch'd be∣cause he believ'd not she touch'd not because she misbeliev'd he touch'd that he might know Christ was risen she touch'd not that she might know he was not so risen as she imagin'd that is as in former times she knew him And  Christ  did hereby silently tell her there was a great Difference between a glorious and a mortal Body between the Condition of momentary and eternal Life and that she should rather with Reverence fall down afar off than with such Familiarity ap∣proach to touch him that she was first  to embrace him with a firm Faith then she should touch him with more worthy  Hands  and therefore he commanded her to go about that which requir'd more haste to run to his Brethren and inform them that he would go before them in∣to  Galilee  and there they should see him and so  M Magdalen  preferring her  Lord  's Will to her own obey'd his Command in departing but thought her self but an unfortunate Messenger of most joyful News being banish'd from her Master's Presence to carry News of his Resur∣rection and going in this perplex'd Manner she meets by the way the other holy Women who first came with her to the Grave whom the Angels had then assur'd of  Christ  's Resurrection and as they all pass'd towards the Disciples  Jesus  met them saying  All Hayle and so they came near and took hold of his Feet  and ador'd him then he said unto them  Fear not go tell my Brethren that I go into Galilee there they shall see me  Thus Christ apply'd a Lenitive to as∣swage  M Magdalen  's Pain after the sharp Corrosive which had griev'd her tender Wound which was made rather by Ig∣norance than Error and was as soon cur'd as known and therefore she was now admitted to kiss his Feet  She had indeed great Favours granted her not only to see Angels but to see  Christ  and him first of all and more than that to be employ'd by  Christ  upon a heavenly Errand and no Reason for this but that she lov'd much We cannot say she believ'd much since she believ'd no more than just as much as the  High Priest  would have the World believe that he was taken away by Night Her Faith cannot be commended but her Love cannot but be prais'd of which she gave good Proofs to  Christ  both living and dead St  Augustin  tells us the Rea∣son why  Christ  suffer'd her not to touch him was to wean her from all sensual and fleshly touching to teach her a new and true Touch for her touching of his Body which she desir'd would last but forty Days and he therefore taught her another Touch that might serve to the World's End  But St  Gregory  says  Christ  's forbid∣ding her to touch him was to save Time he being desirous to dispatch her upon an Errand better pleasing to him and that requir'd more haste he was care∣ful that his Friends might receive Com∣fort with the first and therefore he bids her go with all speed for that it would do  them  more good to hear of his Ri∣sing  than it would do  her  to stand and touch him It was a great Honour to  Mary Magdalen  to be the Messenger of these blessed Tydings there is no harsh Term in this Message for tho' his Di∣sciples fled from him forsook him and forswore him he hath forgotten and for∣given all he does not cast them off as they did him but sends to them by the Name of  Brethren  But this special Ho∣nour that was done to  Mary Magdalen  was withall a silent blaming the Disci∣ples for sitting at Home so drooping in a Corner that  Christ  not finding any of them is feign to seek a new  Apostle  and finding her where he should have found them and did not to send to them by the Hand of her whom he first found at the Sepulcher and by this  Mary Mag∣dalen  ought to be satisfied for to be thus sent to be the Messenger of these blessed Tydings is a more special Ho∣nour done to her than if she had been let alone and been admitted to touch  Christ  which she so eagerly desir'd for we may be sure  Christ  would never have enjoyn'd her to leave the better and take the worse to forbear to touch him to make the more haste to them if that had not then been the better Employment The Reason why  Christ  bids her go and tell them  That I ascend  was because  he knew they would say Oh He is risen We shall have his Company again as we had before but by sending them word of his Ascending he gave them warning betimes that he Rose not to make any Abode with them or to Con∣verse with them on Earth as formerly he had done He knew this would be a hard Lesson and would trouble them much for they were still over addicted to his Bodily Being with them here they would have detain'd him built him a Tabernacle here and by their good Will would never have let him go from hence  This was their Error and to rid them of this Earthly Mind thus striving to affix him and keep him here on Earth he shews them they were much mistaken and sets them right When  Christ  was risen he was not far from ascending and if we be risen with him we must no more look down into the Grave nor fix our selves on Earth but strive to ascend with him also  All Things in  Heaven  and  Earth  do so rising they ascend presently In  Hea∣ven  the  Stars  are no sooner risen above the  Horizon  but they are in their As∣cent and never leave ascending till they come to the highest  Vertical  Point In  Earth  the little Spires that peep out of the Ground now at this Time Na∣ture's time of her Yearly Resurrection they are no sooner out but up they shoot and never leave to aspire till they have attain'd the full Pitch of the Growth al∣low'd them by Nature so should we from our Birth always ascend nor ever stop till we reach the highest Perfection our Nature is capable of  In our selves it is not strange for earth∣ly Men to have earthly Minds and ha∣ving Clay for our Original that our Souls should cleave to the Dust so it is with us tho' so it ought not to be The very  Heathen Poet  saw that tho' we be made  of  Earth we are not made  for  Earth That an  Heavenly Soul  was not put into an  earthly Body  to the end the earthly Body should draw it down to the  Earth  but rather that the Soul should lift it up to Heaven and so much is shewn by our  os sublime vultus ad sydera  the very Frame of our Body that bears us up thi∣therward for tho' we are born in this World and live in it yet we belong to another Corporation we are Denizens of another Country and Free of that  City  which is above whose Builder is the  Lord  Thus we see by what happened to  Mary Magdalen  and the other devour Women that they were not only capa∣ble of Religious Offices but that they were  early  in their Religious Work they began  betimes  There is but one  Pa∣rable  that tells us That they that came  late  to the Labour were as well re∣warded as the  earliest  and that is no Encouragement to late Comers as not so much respecting the different Ages of a Man but different Year of the World And let that  Parable  be understood after the Vulgar way of interpreting it yet we should remember that these that were call'd at the last Hours came as soon as they were call'd  Mary Magdalen  and these Women were also earnest and se∣dulous and tho' their Devotion was carried upon Things that could not be intirely done yet  God  cast no Cloud of Discouragement upon them but exalted and maintain'd their Holy Confidence and accepted their Devotion for where the Root and Substance of the Work is Piety  God  often overlooks some Errors in Circumstance as inconsiderable  Let therefore  Mary Magdalen  be our Pattern let us learn from her that we may find  Christ  if we seek him  early  and diligently we shall meet him Let  us learn of her to fear no Dangers in quest of  Christ  and to think of no Com∣forts without him let us rise with her in the Morning of our good Motions and let them not sleep in Sloath when Diligence may execute them let us run with Repentance to our sinful Hearts which instead of being  Temples  thro' our Faults are become  Tombs  to  Christ  Let us roll away the Stone of our former Hardness remove all heavy Loads of  Sin  that oppress us and look into our Souls whether we can there find  Christ  If he be not there within us let us stand Weeping without and see him in other Creatures seek him and not his seek him for himself and not for his Gifts If our  Faith  have found  Christ  in a Cloud let our  Hope  seek to see him If our  Hope  hath led us to see him let our  Love  seek farther into him Let us seek him truly and no other for him seek him purely and no other Thing with him seek him only and nothing besides him and if at the first Search he appear not think not much to persevere in Tears and to continue our seeking as  Mary Magdalen  did Let us stand upon the Earth tread under us all worldly Vani∣ties and touch them only with the Soals of our Feet that is with the lowest  and least part of our Affections and to look better into the  Tomb  let us bow down our Necks to the Yoak of Humi∣lity that with lowly Looks we may find him whom swelling and haughty Thoughts have driven away And if we can perceive in the Tombs of our Hearts the Presence of  Christ  's two first Messen∣gers that is at the Feet Sorrow for the bad that is past and at the Head Desire to a better that is to come en∣tertain them with Sighs and welcome them with Penitent Tears and let us not cease seeking till we find  Christ  Thus preparing our selves with Dili∣gence coming with Speed standing with fix'd Hopes and stooping with humble Hearts if we crave with  Mary Magdalen  no other Thing of Jesus but  Jesus  himself he will answer our Tears with his Presence and continue with us for ever  Of the LIFE and CONVERSION of St  Paul  S  T  PAƲL  was born at  Tar∣sus  the Metropolis of  Ci∣licia  a City vastly  rich  and  populous  wherein an  Aca∣demy  was furnished with Schools of Learning where there were Schollars that excelled in all Parts of Polite Literature Those of other Pla∣ces and even  Rome  it self was behold∣en to it as  Strabo  tells us for many of its best Professors and therefore it was made a  Roman Munificium  invested with many Privileges by  Julius Caesar  and  Augustus  who granted to its Inhabitants the Honours and Immunities of  Citizens  of  Rome  The Parents of St  Paul  were  Jews  of the Tribe of  Benjamin  we find him described in Scripture by two Names the one  Hebrew  the other  Latin  pro∣bably referring both to his  Jewish  and  Roman  Capacity the one  Saul  a Name frequent in the Tribe of  Benjamin  ever  since the first  King of Israel  of that Name was chosen out of that  Tribe  In Me∣mory whereof they were wont to give their Children that Name at their  Cir∣cumcision  His other Name  Paul  was  assum'd  by him as some think at his Con∣version to shew his Humility tho' others think he had two Names given him at his Circumcision  Saul  relating to his  Jewish  Original and  Paul  referring to the  Roman  Corporation where he was born Or if this Name was taken by him afterwards it was probably done at his Conversion according to the Custom of the  Hebrews  who us'd many Times upon extraordinary Occasions especial∣ly upon entring into a more strict and religious Course of Life to change their Names for new ones which is also usual with our  Religious  in some Orders to change their Names following therein this  Apostle  who chang'd his Name from  Saul  to  Paul  after his coming into the Ministry and yet some think he bor∣row'd that Name from  Sergius Paulus  the  Roman Lieutenant  But St  Chryso∣stom  tells us it was from his low Stature being but three Cubits high and there∣fore says  Tricubitatis ille tamen coelum ascendit  I will not presume to clear this Difficulty but leave it to better Judg∣ments  Saul  in his Youth was brought up in the  Schools  of  Tarsus  fully instructed in all the  Liberal Arts  and  Sciences  He was also Taught a particular Trade ac∣cording to the  known  Maxim and Prin∣ciple of the  Jews That he who does not teach his Son a Trade learns him to be a Thief  They thought it not only fit but a necessary Part of Education for the wisest and most learned  Rabbins  to be brought up to Manual Trades where∣by if there was Occasion they might be able to maintain themselves which Custom was taken up by the  Christians  especially by the  Monks  of Primitive Times and is continued to this Day a∣mongst the Reformed Orders in  God  's  Church  who together with their strict Profession and almost incredible Exer∣cises of Devotion many take upon them particular Trades whereat they daily Work not for maintaining themselves in particular but for the Benefit of their whole Community The Trade of  Saul  was that of a  Tentmaker  whereat he Wrought even after he was call'd to be an  Apostle  and tho' this was but a mean Course of Life yet it was a gainful Trade especially in those Countries where frequent use was made of Tents  Saul  having ran thro' the whole Course of his Studies and laid the sure Foun∣dations of human Learning at  Tarsus  he was by his Parents sent to  Jerusalem  to be perfected in the Study of the  Law  and put under the Tutorage of  Gama∣liel  who was a  Doctor of Law  and reckon'd a Person of great Wisdom and Prudence a Man of chief Note and Au∣thority in the  Jewish Sanhedrim  and  President  of it when our  Blessed Saviour  was brought before it Under this great Master was  Saul  educated in the Know∣ledge of the  Law  wherein he made such large and quick Improvements that he soon excell'd his Fellow Pupils and amongst the various Sects at that time in  Jerusalem  he was specially Edu∣cated in the Principles and Institutions of the  Pharisees  of which Sect was both his  Father  and  Master  whereof he became a most earnest and zealous Pro∣fessor and  Josephus  tho' a  Pharisee  gives this following Character of them  Lib    "That they were a crafty and subtil Generation of Men and so perverse even to Princes themselves that they would not fear many times to Affront and Oppose them and so far had they insinuated themselves into the Affections and Estimations of the Po∣pulacy  that their good or ill Word was enough to make or blast any one with the People who implicitely would believe them let their Re∣port be never so false or malicious"  Certain it is They were infinitely Proud and Insolent Surly and Illnatur'd they hated all Mankind but themselves and censur'd those who would not be of their Opinion and Way as Reprobates They were extream zealous to gather Proselytes to their Party not to make them more Religious but more fierce and cruel much like some who think all  Religion  confin'd within the Bounds of their own Sect that none but they were the Godly and that all other Per∣sons were  Sons of the Earth  and there∣fore they endeavour'd especially to In∣spire all their Party with a mighty Zeal and Fervency against all that differed from them so that if any did but speak a good Word of our Blessed Saviour he should presently be prosecuted to Death  These dogged and illnatur'd Princi∣ples together with their unmerciful Be∣haviour they endeavour'd to varnish over with a more than ordinary Pretence and Profession of  Religion  and were especially diligent in what cost them lit∣tle  the outward Instances of Religion as frequent Fasting long Praying with demure and mortify'd Looks in a whin∣ing and affected Tone  Saul  was deep∣ly leavened with the active and fiery Genius of this Sect not able to bear with any opposite Party in Religion e∣specially if late or new insomuch that when the  Jews  were resolved to do Execution upon St  Stephen Saul  stood by and kept the Cloaths of them that did it whether he was any farther en∣gaged in his Death we know not but this was enough loudly to proclaim his Approbation and Consent for  God  chief∣ly respects the Heart and if the Vote be passed there that writes the Man guilty tho' he stirs no farther it being easie to murther a Man by a silent Wish or a passionate Desire In all Moral Actions  God  judges by the Will and reckons the Man a Companion in the Sin who tho' possibly he may never actu∣ally join in it does yet inwardly applaud and like it  The Storm thus begun increas'd a∣pace and a violent Persecution began to rise which miserably afflicted and dis∣perst the  Christians  at  Jerusalem  in which  Saul  was a Prime Agent raging about in all Parts with a furious and ungovern∣able  Zeal searching out the  Christians  beating them in the  Synagogues  com∣pelling many to Blaspheme imprisoning others and procuring their Death He was a sort of  Inquisitor  to the  High Priest  by whom he was employ'd to find out those  Christians  who preach'd against the  Law  of  Moses  and after having made a strange Havock at  Jeru∣salem  he addressed himself to the  Sanhe∣drim  and there took out a Commission to go down and ransack the  Synagogue  at  Damascus  where many  Christians  that were persecuted fled for Shelter  Saul  resolving to bring up those he found there to  Jerusalem  in order to their Punishment and Execution But  God  who designed him for a Work of ano∣ther Nature stopt him in his Journey for as he was travelling with his Com∣panions upon the Road not far from  Damascus  on a sudden a Gleam of Light which exceeded the Splendor of the Sun darted from Heaven upon them whereat being very strangely amaz'd and confounded they all fell to the Ground and a Voice call'd to him say∣ing  Saul Saul Why persecutest thou me  To which he reply'd  Lord Who art thou  Who told him He was  Jesus  whom he persecuted because what was  done to the Members was done to the Head that it was hard for him to kick against the Pricks That he now ap∣pear'd to him to make Choice of him for an  Apostle  and Witness of what he had now seen and should after hear that he would stand by him and pre∣serve him and make him a glorious Instrument for the Conversion of the  Gentiles  This said he asked our  Lord  What he would have him to do Who bad him go into the  City  where he should receive his Answer  Saul  's Com∣panions who were present at this Dis∣course heard a confused Sound but no distinct articulate Voice neither saw they him that spoke to  Saul  and pro∣bably they being Ignorant of the  He∣brew  Language wherein  Christ  spoke to  Saul  they heard the Words but knew not the Meaning of them  Thus when  Saul  was wasting the  Church  dispersing the Disciples destroy∣ing the Christians following them from the  Synagogues  into the Streets from thence into their Houses when he breath∣ed out Threatnings and Slaughter the  Lord  without any Expostulation might have poured down Vengeance upon him he might have commanded what Punish∣ment he pleas'd to have serv'd the Exe∣cution  of Wrath against him But if ever  Mercy  and  Judgment  met together here it was  Judicium misericordiae misericordia judicis  a Voice and a Stroak the one striking down to  Earth  the other lifting up to  Heaven  a Light shin∣ing from  Heaven  and a Light shining to direct him to  Heaven  a Light shin∣ing to him that was in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death to bring him from the Snare of Darkness into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of  God  He that was the  Way  met him in the  Way  he that was the  Light  met him with a  Light  he that was the  Word  met him with the Voice of a Word  Saul Saul Why per∣secutest thou me  It was a gracious Favour of the  Lord  to vouchsafe to Question with him but to call him by his Name and to inge∣minate that Name that was a sign of his great Affection and Commiseration It was a Voice indeed the Voice of the  Lord  mighty in Operation This Voice struck him from his Horse to the  Earth  struck him from his Presumption  Per∣secutest thou me  Yet the Voice was not more  Powerful  than  Merciful  It was as  Chrysologus  says  Suaviter fortis fortiter suavis  the heaviest Fall and yet the happiest Fall that ever any had  it was his Fall and his Rising Thus a Dumbness unto  Zachary  was not a dumb Instructor it taught him Faith against another time so  Blindness  sent unto  Saul  took away his  Blindness  making him see more in the Ways of Life than all his Learning gather'd at the Feet of  Gamaliel  could have Re∣vealed unto him  Saul  by this time was gotten up but tho' he found his  Feet  he lost his  Eyes  being struck Blind with the extraordi∣nary Brightness of the  Light  and was therefore led by his Companions into  Damascus  in which Condition he there remained three Days together Fasting and at this Time we may probably sup∣pose it was that he had the Vision and Extasie mention'd by him  There was at this time at  Damascus Ananias  one of the Seventy Disciples a very Devout Man and probably the first Planter of the  Christian Church  in  Damascus  and tho' a  Christian  yet of great Repute amongst the  Jews  To him  Christ  appear'd and directed him to the Street and House where  Saul  of  Tarsus  then Lodged who was then at Prayers and had seen him in a Vision coming to him to lay his Hands upon him that he might receive his Sight  Ananias  startled at the Name of  Saul  having heard of his bloody Temper and Practices knowing upon what Errand he was come to that City was sore afraid But  Jesus  quickly made his Fears vanish by telling him he mistook the Man that he was now become a chosen Vessel to Preach the  Gospel  both to  Jews  and  Gen∣tiles  and before the greatest  Potentates  of the Earth telling him what great Things he should do and suffer for his Sake Hereupon  Ananias  went forth∣with to him laid his Hands upon him and told him  Jesus  had sent him to him that he might receive his Sight and be filled with the  Holy Spirit  which was no sooner said but done and thick Films like Scales fell from his  Eyes  and his  Sight  return'd then he was Baptiz'd and solemnly initiated into the  Christian Faith  after which he soon joyn'd him∣self to the Disciples of that Place to the great Joy and Wonder of the  Church  that the  Wolf  should so soon become a  Lamb  He that was the Mouth of Blas∣phemy is become the Mouth of Christ He that was the Instrument of  Satan  the Organ of the Holy Ghost As says St  Chrysostome Being yet upon the Earth he is an Angel and being yet but a Man he is already in Heaven  What was  done upon him wrought upon all the World he was struck Blind and all the World saw the better for it  St  Chrysostome  calls him a  Ʋniversal Priest  that Sacrificed not  Sheep  and  Goats  but even himself and not only that prepar'd the whole World as a Sacrifice to  God  but so absolutely did he Sacrifice himself and his State in this World as that he chose rather to be  Anathema  separated from  Christ  than that they should but whether that was not out of an over vehement and incon∣siderate Zeal to his Bretheren is too  high  a Point for me to undertake to judge  After these Words  Saul Saul Why persecutest thou me  he was no longer  Saul  there was an immediate change of Affections Here's another manner of Lycanthropy than when a Lamb is made a Wolf for here is a Wolf made a Lamb a Bramble is made a Vine un∣profitable Tares become good Wheat and the last is made first He that was Born out of Time hath not only the Perfection but the Excellency of all his Lineaments  Saul  was breathing Threat∣nings and Slaughter against the  Church  when he was in the height of his Fury  Christ  laid hold on him this was for the  most part  Christ  's Method of Curing When the  Sea  was in a tempestuous Rage when the Waters cover'd the Ship and even shaked that which could re∣move Mountains even the Faith of the Disciples then  Christ  rebukes the Wind and commands a  Calm  When the  Sun  was gone out as a  Gyant  to run his Course as  David  speaks then  God  by the Mouth of another  Josuah  bids the  Sun  stand still When the un∣clean Spirit foam'd and fum'd tore and rent the possessed Persons then  Christ  commanded them to go out  Christ  staid not here till  Saul  being made drunk with Blood was cast into a Slumber as satis∣fied with the Blood of  Christians  in the midst of his Fit Christ gave him Phy∣sick in the heat of his Madness he re∣claims him  St  Paul  gives this Evidence against himself  I persecuted this way unto Death  What could he say more against himself And then says  Christ  to this Tempest be  quiet  to this glaring  Sun  stand  still  to this unclean Spirit  come forth  And in this Sense St  Paul  calls himself  aborti∣vum  a Person born out of Season For whereas the other  Disciples  and  Apostles  had a sort of a Growth under  Christ  and were first his  Disciples  and after his  Apostles  St  Paul  was born a Man an  Apostle not carved out as the rest in Time but an  Apostle  poured out and cast in a Mould as  Adam  was a perfect Man in an instant so was St  Paul  an Apostle so soon as  Christ  took him in Hand For St  Paul  was not in the Number of the  Apostles  at the Descent the  Holy Ghost  But then he had more than an equivalent Evidence of his Mis∣sion For when he travel'd from  Jeru∣salem  to  Damascus  the Heavens were open'd and our  Blessed Saviour  himself spake to him whereupon the Company were astonished and St  Paul  struck Blind with the Glory of the Vision and afterwards being cured by a Miracle at  Damascus  he had no Assistance from the rest of the  Apostles  his Instructions came all from  Christ  immediately And it cannot be deny'd that St  Paul  in some Kind and upon some Subjects is as Elo∣quent as ever Man was not inferior to  Demosthenes  whom some think he had read or some other excellent  Orators  His Speech to  Agrippa  hath as much Force and Address and much more Great∣ness of Mind and noble Freedom than any thing we meet with in the best of the Heathen  Orators  'Tis true the Advantage of St  Paul  's Education was great he had his  Cause  and his  Master  to assist him but yet he met with great  Difficulties and Hazards in the Execu∣tion of his Function For he was to oppose the Religion of the  Jews  to alter the Customs which  Moses  had de∣livered and to decry the Expectation of a  Temporal Messiah  he charged them with the highest Crimes imaginable and told them plainly That they had be∣tray'd the  Saviour  of the World and kill'd the  Prince of Life  And this he told the obstinate  Jews  who were hard∣ned in Prejudice and bigotted to Error and Superstition for which they pleaded Antiquity St  Paul  declar'd to the  San∣hedrim  that  Jesus  whom they had mur∣ther'd was rais'd from the Dead was a  Prince  and  Saviour  and that it was from  him  they were to expect Remission of their Sins with this severe sharpness St  Paul  treated  Faelix  Viceroy of  Ju∣dea  to whom he talked so freely and so pertinently that the Viceroy forgot his Character and  trembled  before him  And yet the Truth is the Beginnings of our  Religion  were very unpromising the first Undertakers began with a slen∣der Force and there was a strange Dis∣proportion between the Cause and the Effect for humanly speaking if  twelve private Men  should now make an Expe∣dition against the  Grand Signior  they would in all Probility be as likely to suc∣ceed  as the  Apostles  were in their En∣terprize when our  Saviour  left them But herein certainly the Providence of God for the Prevention of all Doubts and Scruples was great in that he would not lay the Foundation of  Christian Re∣ligion  as not in the force of Arms so neither of Eloquence and artificial Speech which is often insisted upon by St  Paul Not with Wisdom nor the Ex∣cellency of Speech nor with enticing Words  And it is worthy our Conside∣ration how it was possible for a few poor Men so low in  Interest  and  Edu∣cation  to break through the Opposition of  Jews  and  Gentiles  bafle their Learn∣ing despise their Powers and make them renounce their  Ancient  Belief and that Life they were most in love with But tho' they were short in their natural Capacities their wonderful Suc∣cess is an undeniable Proof of a  Di∣vine Power  that assisted them as  Chry∣sologus  most admirably tells us  Petrus Andreas Jacobus Joannes ger∣manitas combinata ingeminata paupe∣ras in Apostolorum principes eliguntur pauperes censu loco humiles viles arte obscuri vitâ labore communes addicti vigiliis fluctibus mancipati negati ho∣noribus injuriis dati sed in istis quan∣tùm vilis mundanus videbatur aspectus  praetiosus tantùm animas Dei intuitus tunc ridebat Erant censu pauperes sed innocentiâ locupletes loco humiles sed sanctitate sublimes viles arte sed simplicitate praetiosi obscuri vitâ sed vitae merito perlucentes labore com∣munes sed proposito singulares addicti vigiliis sed ad coelestes victorias jam vocati fluctibus mancipati sed fluctibus non demersi negati honoribus dicati magis honoribus non negati injuriis dati sed non injuriis relicti Pertrus Chrysologus Sermo  which shew the particular Gifts that Christ had given to his Apostles  Now to magnifie his  Mercy  and  Glory  more particularly to St  Paul  and to take away all Occasion of Despair  Christ  did upon so many great Disadvantages draw St  Paul  to him whom he brought to that remarkable height on a sudden that the  Church  celebrates the Conver∣sion of no Man but this She does not consider the  Martyrs  as Born till they Die till the World see how they per∣sever'd to the End she takes no Know∣ledge of them Wherefore she calls the Days of their  Death  their  BirthDays  She does not reckon they are  Born  till they  Die  But of St  Paul  she makes assur'd the first Day nay the first Mi∣nute  the first Moment and therefore celebrates his  Conversion  only And as  Christ  dealt with St  Paul  so  God  deals with  us  he will first cast us down be∣fore he will raise us up he will first break us before he will make us in his Fashion The  Lord  only knows how to Wound us out of Love more than that how to Wound us into Love not only with him that Wounds us but into Love with the Wound it self with the very Affliction that he inflicts upon us The  Lord  knows how to strike us so that we shall lay hold on the Hand that strikes us and kiss the Instrument that wounds us  God  brings to the Gate of  Death  and by that Gate he leads us to eternal Life He kills us here that we may live for ever he puts us low here that we may be exalted hereafter And he hath not discover'd but made that Northern Passage to pass from that  Frozen Sea  of Calamity and Tribulation to the heaven∣ly  Jerusalem  There are some Fruits that ripen not without  Frosts  there are some Natures that dispose not themselves to  God  but by  Afflictions  And as  Na∣ture  looks for the Season and does not produce any Thing before so  Grace  looks for the  Assent  of the  Soul  and does not perfect the  whole  Work till  that come It is  Nature  that brings the Season but  Grace  the  Assent  and till the Season for the Fruit till the Assent of the Soul come all is not done  This should be our  Consolation  that how low soever  God  is pleas'd to cast us tho' it be to the  Earth  yet he doth not do it to cast us down but to bring us home And  Death  it self is not so much a  banishing  us out of this World as it is a Visitation of our  Friends  that lie in the  Earth  neither are any nearer of Kin to us than the Earth it self and the Worms of the  Earth  Of NOBILITY  O  BSERVING the several Alterations in Nobility we shall find Four Principal Actors on the Theatres of Great Families The Be∣ginner Advancer Continuer and Ruiner The Beginner is he who either by his Virtues Merits or Riches refineth himself from the Dross of the Vulgar and layeth the Foundation of his House An excellent Workman in∣deed who not only brings his Tools but maketh his Materials But yet An∣cient Nobility seems no just Ground to be Proud and have a high Opinion of our selves because it's borrow'd Those great Actions wherein we had no Share cannot be any part of our Commenda∣tion especially if we have not Abilities to imitate them  Et genus proavos quae non ferimus ipsi  Vix ea nostra voco  That Man must be very Poor who hath nothing of his own to appear in but must Patch up his Pedigree with the Relicks of the Dead and with the Tombstones and Monuments of his Ancestors Next comes the Advancer of Nobility who improves the Patri∣mony of Honour he receiveth and what his Ancestor found Glass and made Cry∣stal he finds Crystal and makes it Pearl Indeed if a Man could bequeath his Virtues Merits and Courage by Will and settle his good Sense Learning and Resolution upon his Children as cer∣tainly as he can his Lands a brave An∣cestor would be a mighty Privilege and great Advantage to his Posterity Next is the Continuer of Nobility who keep∣eth his Nobility alive and passes it to his Children neither marring nor mending it but sends it to his Son as he receiv'd it from his Father Now this Advantage only by Birth is often the effect of a Sloathful and Effeminate Life when Men will attempt nothing either in the Field or in their Closets when they will neither Trouble themselves with Study nor be contented to expose themselves to the Weather which Laziness renders them insignificant to the great Purposes of Life such Men think it a great  Addition to their Birth to stand at the Bottom of a long Parchment Pedigree and that their Blood hath run through the Channels of Honour for many Ages But alas This Antiquity consists only in the continual Frugality of the Family who being once possest of an Estate had the Discretion to keep it and so hath the Advantage of Living in a better House and Eating and Drinking better than those who want a Fortune Indeed if Ancient Nobility did convey to us any Advantage of Body or Mind and that every Generation grew wiser stronger handsomer or longerliv'd than other if the Breed of a Man's Family were thus improv'd then indeed the Quality of their Arms would be contrary to their Cloaths the one would always grow better the other worse for Wearing The last is the Ruiner of Families who basely degenerates from his Ancestors so that Nobility in him hath run so far from its first Starting that it's tired and whilst he lives he is no better than his Grandfather's Tomb without carv'd over with honourable Titles within full of Emptiness and Corruption Such noble Men as these last look upon it as one of the best Perfections of Nature to Dress themselves well and to come  handsomly into a Room but let me tell these CeremonyGentlemen that I think it much better that a Man's Parts should lie in his Head rather than in his Heels Indeed in some Persons wellborn there is a peculiar Nobleness of Temper in them A Man may distinguish their Quality by the Air of their Faces which are good Accomplishments and recom∣mend them to Company with some Ad∣vantage but then Men must not be fond of these small Formalities nor magnifie them too much I know in  England  that a plain Gentleman of an ancient Family is accounted a Person of better Quality than a new made Knight tho' the Reason of their Knighthood was ne∣ver so Meritorious and therefore many such Gentlemen have refus'd to be Knighted but I think they were much in the wrong For the Reason why those who are placed in that Degree of Honour precede others who are afterwards rai∣sed in the same height is for Encourage∣ment of Industry to make Men for∣ward to exert their earliest Endeavours to deserve well of the Prince or State It is but reasonable that Merit should be consider'd of what Date soever it is and a worthy Action ought as well to be consider'd and rewarded as one  of the same Kind was a thousand Years since If the Inheritors of Ancient Ho∣nour have not by Personal Additions im∣prov'd that Stock which was granted to their Ancestors there is no Reason it should be valued above the same Degree Precedency excepted which is given now For to affirm That a Family rais'd to Nobility by King  Charles  or King  James  is not as good as one rais'd by the Conqueror is a Reflection upon those Kings and it supposes their Judg∣ment and Authority less considerable and that the Fountain of Honour is dried up Honour is not like  China  Dishes which must lie some Ages under Ground before it comes to any Perfe∣ction In taking a true Esteem of No∣bility we are not so much to consider its Antiquity as the Merit of him to whom it was first granted and the Di∣stinction which the Prince put upon it  No Man will affirm an old Shilling to be better than a new HalfCrown or an old brass Medal dug out of the Ground long since to be more Valua∣ble than the same Weight in Gold If a Man were to pay a Debt the late King  James  's Image upon a Piece of Gold would be more serviceable to him than  Caesar  's old Coins which are only valu'd  for their Usefulness because they often rectify Chronology and explain Hi∣story and retrieve us several material Parts of Learning which had otherwise been lost  Conquerors made Soldiers ambitious to follow them by sharing the Fruits of their Conquests with them and when their Successors had not Estates suffici∣ent to Reward all the glorious Actions and eminent Services which Persons did for them being persuaded that a Man of Courage values nothing so much as Honour which distinguishes him from other Men they invented Knighthood which without exhausting their Trea∣sure would gain them the Honour of their Subjects and inflame all others with an extream Desire to make them∣selves worthy of the same Honour and it was for this Reason that they created Knights either just before the Battle to make them ingage more resolutely or presently after it to recompence those that had the greatest Hand in the Vi∣ctory Thus Nobility is a Quality ac∣quir'd by virtuous Actions and emi∣nent Services which some Persons have performed to the Prince and State and tho' Fortune should have more Influence than Merit upon the dispensing of these  Qualities yet the same Judgment is still to be made because Princes are subject to their Passions rewarding more boun∣tifully and raising higher some of their Servants than others But if a Man be advanced for engaging himself in an un∣just Quarrel he hath no better Pretence to Honour than a resolute Highwayman may challenge and the Marks of all Favours that either come by servile Flat∣tery or a dextrous Application to the Vices of their Princes are rather infa∣mous than honourable to their Posteri∣ty being enobled for those Qualities for which they should have been pu∣nish'd It is a lessening to a Man's No∣bility when the Reasons or Grounds of it are unknown and when the first Prin∣ciples of Honour happen to be thus Course and Counterfeit 'tis not in the Power of Time to mend them when the Rise of a Family is owing to such an Original a Man has a particular Rea∣son not to flourish too much upon the Gifts of his Fortune since there is so much Alloy in it Nobility rais'd by Arms when lawfully undertaken is cer∣tainly more great than that which comes by Commerce The Profession of a Soldier has a particular Title to Ho∣nour It is more Noble than the rest  and no wise Man will ever envy or les∣sen the just Character of Military Glo∣ry The Courage of a Soldier does his Country not much Service after his Death the Consequences of his Valour seldom reach beyond his Death so there are few the better for it except those he engages for A Martial Man unless polish'd by Learning is usually sour in his Behaviour The old Heroes were none of the genteelest Men  A∣chilles  tho' a great Soldier was very rugged and morose in his Conversa∣tion The Advantages of Learning are certainly very great without some share of this War it self cannot be success∣ful nay without the Assistance of Let∣ters a Man can never be qualified for any considerable Post in the Camp For Courage without Conduct is not fit to Command and many times does more hurt than good It is Learning that teaches a General the Successes and Events of Actions in former Ages It instructs him how to take Advantage of his Enemies and to avoid those Miscar∣riages which have been fatal to others before him It teaches him how to For∣tifie and Assault how to manage the Difference of Ground and Weather  and the Advantages of Learning are more lasting than those of Arms Learn∣ing in a Commander is like a Diamond set in Gold I do not intend that a Commander should be versed in thor∣ny SchoolQuestions but in History which is a silent Study and reserv'd Work Those that are not versed in it have Cricks in their Necks and can't look backward nor see behind them the Actions which long since were per∣form'd History makes a young Man to be old without gray Hairs being privileged with the Experience of Age without the Infirmities or Inconveni∣ences thereof Nay it is not only ma∣king Things past present but inables one to make a rational Conjecture of Things to come For this World affords no new Accidents but in the same Sense wherein we call it a New Moon which is the Old one in another shape and yet no other than what hath been formerly Old Actions return again furbished over with some new and diffe∣rent Circumstances  Those that are only Continuers of their Honour or Nobility deceive the Desires and Hopes of their Friends Good is not good when proceeding  from them from whom far better is expected Youthful Virtues are so pro∣mising that they cannot come off at riper Age with Credit without perform∣ing something that may advance the Honour of their Family and build their Houses one Story higher than they found them  If our Ancestors have gain'd Honour by the War we should enquire whether it were in a just Cause and whether Enterprizes or Advantages were gain'd by Bravery or whether by Chance or Treachery for a great many Persons have ventur'd far and yet continue in their first Obscurity and I have known some in my Time that are now grown great Men only by having the good Fortune to fall under the Notice of their General and being sent by him with the good News of a Victory they have been highly Rewarded and Advanced Such Men as these are thrown up Hill by another Man's Arms and made con∣siderable by ChanceMedly their Me∣rits having been very inconsiderable or rather nothing at all when other Men in the same Battle perform'd much more signal Service than that former Person yet their Courage was never Rewarded  but lost in the Crowd and Tumult of the Action and got nothing but Blows for their Pains whereas the other are be∣come Great not by their Genealogy but by good Fortune and having their Tongues well hung and telling their Story handsomely which was their great∣est Merit Men that are thus preferr'd should remember that there were others which ventur'd further and perform'd more considerable Service which mis∣carried as to any private Advantage be∣cause they were not so lucky to give an Account to him that was able to Re∣ward So that we daily see many Per∣sons well furnish'd for Employments and Honour go out of the World as obscurely as they came into it only for want of a good Occasion to bring them into Light Now such Men as before∣mention'd who have receiv'd so valua∣ble Consideration for their small or no Services ought to acquiesce and not press too much being Gentlemen only of the first Head and should therefore manage their Advancement obligingly for by treating People roughly they do but expose themselves and reproach their own former Condition  Now he that is truly Noble hath far different Sentiments his Greatness is easie obliging and agreeable so that none have just Cause to wish him Less He is sensible it is the Part of true No∣bility to be affable in his Converse and generous in his Temper He is equally remov'd from the extreams of Pride and Baseness and as Prosperity does not make him Haughty so neither does Adversity make him Demean himself he scorns either to trample upon those below him or to cringe to the greatest Monarch  Ancient Nobility is very glorious when 'tis found with Virtue which adds new Splendour to the Honour of his House and challenges Respect from all but Lewd Greatness is nothing but the Rigour of Vice having both Mind and Merits to be uncontroulably Lewd And a debauched Son of a Noble Family is one of the intollerable Burthens of the Earth and the good Education he hath had is an Auxiliary to his Shame and the Brightness of his Ancestors makes his Darkness more notorious To be Good and Great is an excellent Com∣mendation but he is more to be valued that is Good whose Father expired a  Clown than the vitious Son of the great∣est Lord tho' his Lineal Descent be never so high For Virtue in a Man of obscure Parents is like an unpolish'd Diamond which lies among Pebbles which tho' neglected by the Vulgar yet the wise Lapidary takes it up as a Jewel  Of CONTENTMENT  I  F Peace as most believe establishes the Throne of Happiness and safely guards it 'tis Contentment alone that crowns it if Safety be the Fort Contentment is the Magazine Peace without Contentment is but Le∣thargy Safety without it is but a Pri∣son but Contentment without both is a Kingdom If without following Peace a Man becomes his own Enemy if with∣out endeavouring Safety he be his own Traytor without enjoying Contentment he is his own Troubler the Discontented Man hath neither Neighbour nor Friend nor indeed himself 'Tis not in the rich Fool's Barns nor in  Ahab  's ravish'd Vine∣yard nor in  Achitophel  's knack of Wit no nor in wiser  Solomon  's dearbought Experience no 'tis a quiet Content∣ment of Spirit that a Man possesses him∣self A Man may pick a Quarrel with himself in the midst of all worldly Hap∣piness  without this Charm of SelfCon∣tentment The Truth is Discontent is the Bone that the Devil throws into eve∣ry Man's Mouth to gnaw upon and break his Teeth with You shall hard∣ly find any Man that complains not of some Want tho' it be but Want of his own Will Things go not right if they run not upon the vertiginous Wheels of his own Fancy the poor Man thinks the World unequally dealt and the rich Man thinks so too because the Care together with the Keys hang so heavi∣ly about him the Schollar thinks the Soldier hath all the Money and he a∣gain that the other hath all the Ease the single Man wants a Wife and the marry'd Man wants no less in that he wants not a Wife and Men strive to vexthemselves by their own Discontents and flatter themselves in not doing what they should do by presuming what they would do were but their Condition o∣ther than it is not considering that every Estate hath its Weights as well as Wings and that the true Pleasure of Life is to be free from Perturbation to enjoy the present without any anxious Depen∣dance upon the future not to amuse our selves either with Hopes or Fears but to rest satisfied with what we have for  he that is so wants nothing the great Blessings of Mankind are within us and within our reach but we shut our Eyes and like People in the dark we fall foul upon every thing we search for with∣out finding it an equality of Mind makes every Man his own Supporter whereas he that is born up by any thing else may fall it is a contented Mind that makes a Man Happy there must be a Con∣stancy in all Conditions with such an indifferency for the Bounties of Fortune that either with them or without them we may live Contentedly  It is the part of a great Mind to be temperate in Prosperity and resolute in Adversity There are some that will close and grapple with ill Fortune and will come off victorious but there are others again so delicate that they can∣not so much as bear a scandalous Report which is the same thing as if one should quarrel for being justled in a Crowd or dashed as he walks in the Streets A brave Man must expect to be tossed for he is to steer his Course in the Teeth of Fortune and to work against Wind and Weather  The greatest Cause of Impatience grows not so much from the Force of Calamity as from the Reluctance of the  Mind of him that suffers it this raises the Billows within for tho' the Calami∣ty may be rough and beyond our Power to extricate yet when it meets with a Mind as tumultuous as the Calamity it raises a Storm as when the Wind and Tyde are contrary which may endan∣ger the Vessel  He that violently contends against Mis∣fortunes is like one bound with strong Bonds his struggling gauls him more than his Bonds would otherwise do and a proud Spirit contributes more to his own Uneasiness than his Cross does But Calmness of Mind breaks the force of the Calamity and the contented Man looks upon his worst Condition to be less than he deserves for so long as we live in this World there is no Condi∣tion so troublesome but it may be worse If we be Poor and under a Cloud of Ig∣nominy and Reproach yet if we have our Health of Body and Composedness of Mind that's more than we deserve nay if we be under a Complication of Misfortunes so long as our Lives are spared there's Hope and we must be Patient under all Conditions submitting our selves intirely to the Will of God and that not only as an Act of Necessity and Duty but as an Act of Choice and  Prudence since all the Successes of our Life are under the Government of Providence and we may be assured that God will either in due time re∣move them or support us under them  Temporal Afflictions are Spiritual Phy∣sick being administred by the no less tender than skillful Hand of Providence but we like foolish Patients embitter our Condition by chewing the Pills which we should swallow we mingle our Passions with our Crosses and thro' Impatience struggle with our Yoak thereby making our Burthen more hea∣vy and our Afflictions the more grie∣vous God's Love is fatherly for Ease as well as motherly for Tender∣ness as a Father he will sometimes hum∣ble his Children by Afflictions sustain∣ing them with his Hand not as a Mo∣ther still indulging them in Delights He does always send his Staff with his Rod his Grace with his Affliction to Instruct Support and Comfort us Where∣fore it's well said That all the Troubles and Distresses that befal us tho' bitter Arrows yet they come from the sweet Hand of God whose special Providence over us is such that he afflicts us in Mercy God's Patronage and Protecti∣on is not like that of Men who as  Sal∣vian  says They offend the Miserable by defending them like the thorny Bush to which in the Storm when the poor Sheep run for Shelter they lose their Fleeces But God is a Sun and a Shield to those in Affliction A Sun to en∣lighten them in the midst of Darkness and a Shield to defend them in the midst of Dangers and by his Spiritual Providence he then saves when we seem to be past Succour and there∣fore we have reason not only patient∣ly to submit but cheerfully and con∣tentedly to bear any Condition which he dispenses and with an implicite Faith to resign our Wills to his be∣ing assured it is infinitely more Wise and Just than ours  Seneca  says  Optimi milites ad duris∣sima mittuntur  the stoutest Soldiers are put upon the hottest Service and so the best Men upon the sharpest Suffe∣rings It is a mark of a General's E∣steem when he puts an Officer upon a Post of Danger who does not say his General uses him ill but does him Ho∣nour and so should we say that are commanded to encounter Difficulties A Master gives his hopeful Schollars the hardest Lessons so God deals with the most generous Spirits and we are  not to look upon the cross Encounters of Fortune as a Cruelty but as a Con∣test God tries and hardens us the fa∣miliarity of Misfortunes brings us the Contempt of them and that Part is strongest which is most exercised the Seaman's Hand is callous the Soldier's Arm is strong the Tree that is exposed to the Wind takes the best Root Those People that live in a perpetual Winter in extremity of Frost and Want where a Cave a Lock of Straw or a few Leaves is all their Covering and wild Beasts their Nourishment all this by Custom is not only made tollerable but when once 'tis taken up by Necessity by little and little it becomes Pleasant to them Why should we then account that Condition of Life a Calamity which is the Lot of many Nations Our Life is a Warfare and what brave Man would not rather chuse to be in a Tent than in a Shambles Fortune seems to encounter a fearful Man there's no Honour in the Victory where there's no Danger in the Way to it  She tries  Mutius  by Fire  Rutilius  by Banishment  Socrates  by Prison  Cato  by Death 'Tis only in adverse Fortune and bad Times that we find great Ex∣amples  Mutius  thought himself Hap∣pier  with his Hand in the Flame than if it had been in the Bosom of his Mi∣stress He was a Man only of a Mili∣tary Courage without the help either of Philosophy or Letters who when he found he had kill'd the Secretary instead of  Porsenna  the Prince burnt his Right Hand to Ashes for the Mistake and held his Arm in the Flame till it was taken away by his very Enemies And  Porsenna  did more easily Pardon  Mutius  for his intent to kill him than  Mutius  forgave himself for missing of his Aim He might have done a Luckier Thing but never a Braver  Metellus  suffer'd Exile reso∣lutely  Rutilius  cheerfully  Socrates  dis∣puted in the Danger and tho' he might have escaped refused it to shew the World how easie a thing it was to sub∣due the two great Terrours of Mankind Death and Pain The Action of  Ruti∣lius  was commended by his very Ene∣mies who upon a glorious and publick Principle chose rather to lose his Coun∣try than to return from Banishment the only Man who deny'd any thing to  Sylla  the Dictator who recalled him but he not only refus'd to come but retired farther off  Let them  says he  who think Banishment a Misfortune live Slaves at  Rome  under the imperious  Cruelties of  Sylla  He that sets a Price upon the Heads of Senators and after a Law of his own Institution against CutThroats becomes the greatest himself  Is it not better for a Man to live abroad in Exile than to be massacred at home 'Tis not the Torment but the Cause we are to consider and in suffering for a good Cause the more Pain the more Renown and we must look upon our Banishment and Hardships as Acts of Providence which suffers Particulars many Times to be wounded for Con∣servation of the whole Besides God chastizes some People under appearance of Blessing them turning their Prospe∣rity to their Ruin  What was  Regulus  the worse because Fortune made choice of him for an emi∣nent Instance of Patience he was thrown into a Case of Wood stuck round on the inside with pointed Nails so that which way soever he turned his Body it rested upon his Wounds his Eyelids were cut off to keep him waking and yet  Mecaenas  was not happier upon his Bed than  Regulus  upon his Torments  It hath pleased the Gods  saith he  to single me out for an Experiment of the Force of humane Nature  Indeed no Man knows his own Strength or Value but  by being put to the Proof the Pilot is try'd in a Storm the Soldier in a Battel No Man can be happy that does not stand firm against all Contingencies and Mis∣fortunes for the more we struggle with our Necessities we draw the Knot the harder the more the Bird flutters in the Snare the surer he is caught so that the best way is to submit and lie still under this double Consideration that the Pro∣ceedings of God are unquestionable and his Decrees not to be revoked That Man is only Happy that is unmov'd with any external Misfortune or at least so little mov'd that the keenest Arrow in the Quiver of Fortune is but as the prick of a Needle to him rather than a Wound and all her Weapons fall upon him as Hail upon the Roof of a House that crackles and skip off again without any Damage to the Inhabitant  Some Philosophers have search'd so far for Arguments of Comfort against Pain as to doubt whether there was any such thing as Sense of Pain and yet when any great Evil hath befaln them they could sigh and groan and cry out as loud as other Men Others have held that Afflictions are no real Evils but only in Opinion and there∣fore a wise Man ought not to be trou∣bled  at them But he must be a very wise Man that can forbear being trou∣bled at things that are troublesome Others would delude this Trouble by a graver way of Reasoning  viz  that these things are fatal and therefore we ought not to be troubled at them it being in vain to be troubled at what we cannot help But  Augustus  made a sharp Reply to one that ministred this Comfort to him  Hoc ipsum est  says he  quod me male habit  This was so far from giving any Ease to his Mind that it was the very thing that troubled him But the best Moral Argument of Patience is the Advantage of Patience it self That is to bear Evils as quietly as we can is the way to make them lighter and easier but to toss and fling and to be restless is good for no∣thing but to fret and inrage our Pain 'tis like Men in a Feaver who infinite∣ly increase their Heat by their tumb∣ling and tossing more than if they lay still and thus we gall our Sores and make the Burthen that is upon us sit more uneasie and like the Ship that is not broken by the Rock but by its own vi∣olent Motion against it and therefore we must so manage our selves under  Afflictions as not to make them more grievous than indeed they are  If we give way to our Passions we do but gratifie our selves for the pre∣sent in order to our future Disquiet but if we resist and conquer them we lay the Foundation of perpetual Peace and Tranquility in our Minds The more we gratifie our Lusts the more craving they will be  Crescit indulgens sibi diras hydrops  every Lust has a kind of hydropick Distemper the more we drink the more we shall thirst so that by retrenching our inordinate Desires we do not rob our selves of any Pleasures but only the trouble of farther Dissatisfacti∣on  He that enjoys the greatest Happiness in this World does still want one Hap∣piness more to secure him for the fu∣ture what he possesses at present and if the Enjoyments of this Life were cer∣tain yet they are unsatisfying it is a hard thing that every thing in this World can trouble us but nothing can give us Satisfaction I know not how it is but either we or the things of this World or both are so fantastical that we can neither be well with these things nor without them If we be hungry we are in Pain and if we be full we are un∣easie  if we are poor we think our selves miserable and if we be rich we com∣monly really are so if we are in a low Condition we fret and murmur if we chance to get up and are raised to Greatness we are many times farther from Content than before so that we pursue the Happiness of this World just as little Children chase Birds when we think we are very near it and have it almost in our Hands it flies farther from us than it was at first Indeed the En∣joyments of this World are so far from affording us Satisfaction as the sweetest of them are most apt to satiate and cloy us All the Pleasures of this World are so contriv'd as to yield us very little Happiness if they go off soon they signify nothing and if they stay long we are sick of them After a full Draught of any sensual Pleasure we presently loath it and hate it as much after the Enjoy∣ment as we searched it and longed for it in Expectation But the Delights of the other World as they still give us full Satisfaction so we shall never be weary of them every Repetition of them will be accompanied with a new Pleasure and Contentment In the Fe∣licities of Heaven two things will be reconciled which never met together in  any sensual Delight long and full Enjoy∣ment and yet a fresh and perpetual Pleasure it would embitter the Pleasures of Heaven to see an End of them tho' at never so great a Distance But God hath so ordered things that the vain Delights of this World should be tempo∣rary but the substantial Pleasures of the next World be as lasting as they are excellent  That Man is truly happy who is tempt∣ed to no anxious Forecasts for future E∣vents knowing nothing can happen in Contradiction of that Supreme Will in which he hath Sanctuary which will certainly chuse for him with that Ten∣derness that an indulgent Father would for his Child that casts its self into his Arms When our Will is thus inrolled with God's all Calamities are unstring∣ed and even those things which seem most repugnant to our sensitive Natures are yet very agreeable to our Spirits There is no Face of Adversity so formi∣dable which set in this Light will not look amiable let us but make sure of Resignation and Content will flow into us without our farther Industry  Socra∣tes  said rightly of Contentment opposing it to the Riches of Fortune that 'tis the Wealth of Nature for it gives every thing  that we have learnt to want and really need and Resignation in our present State bestows all things that a Christian not only needs but can desire 'Tis the Usurpation of our Will over our Rea∣sons which breeds all the Confusions and Tumults within our own Hearts and there is no possibility of curbing its In∣solence but by putting them into safe Custody by oommitting it to him who alone can order our unrully Wills and nothing but Experience can inform us of the Serenity and Calm of that Soul who has resigned his Will to God  It is certain in the Course of the World there must be a greater number of Crosses and Troubles than of external Comforts nay there is scarce any Comfort but like  Jonah  's Gourd it hath a Worm at the Root of it which not only withers the Comfort it self but creates greater Trouble and Sorrow than the Comfort it self hath if intirely enjoy'd so that in all worldly things the Stock of Troubles is three times greater than that of Com∣forts so true is that of  Job A Man is born to troubles as the Sparks fly upward  why therefore should a Man sink into Discontent because the World doth but follow its own natural State  'Tis certain a prudent Man is like the Elixir it turns Iron into Gold makes the most sowr Condition of Life not only tolerable but useful and convenient for a wise Man will mould and frame his worst Condition into a Condition of Comfort by his Patience and he that can content himself with the good Tem∣per of his own Heart has no Reason to be discontented with his Condition since if it be not good he can make it such the Mind being the chief Matter either in Content or Discontent We need no other Proof than that of  Ahab  and  Haman  the one a great King the other a great Favourite to a mighty Mo∣narch full of Wealth and Honour yet a covetous Mind in the one and a proud Mind in the other made the former seek for a little Spot of Ground and the latter grew so highly discontented for want of the Knee of a poor  Jew  that it withered all his Enjoyments Patience and Resignation give us Possession of our selves we then remain Masters of our Passions and tho' there be Storms and Tempests and rolling Seas without us yet all is calm within and tho' I want something that others have yet I have somewhat that many better than I want If I want Wealth yet I have Health if  I want Health yet I have Children which others want Thus we should learn Con∣tentment by considering others Wants and our Enjoyments and not learn Discom∣forts from others Enjoyments tho' these are only moral Considerations yet they are of much Use and Moment and car∣ry'd the Heathens a great way in the Vir∣tue of Patience But we are furnish'd with a more excellent way because no Affliction befalls us but is reached out to us from the Hand of Divine Providence from whom we have our Being The ge∣neral State of Mankind in this World is a State of Trouble and Affliction and is so incident to all Degrees and Conditions of Mankind that no Person of whatsoever Age or Sex but hath a Part in this com∣mon State of Mankind And we find Men in all Ages that only by the Dire∣ction of natural Light have calmed their Disquiets and reasoned themselves into Contentment under the greatest and most terrible Pressures Men who amidst the acutest Torments have still preserv'd a Serenity of Mind and have frustrated Contempts and Reproaches by disregard∣ing them and surely we shall give a very ill Account of Christianity if we cannot do as much with it as they did without it  The greatest Cause of Discontent is that Men have no definite Measure of their Desires 'tis not the Supply of all their real Wants will serve their  urn their Appetites are precarious and depend up∣on Contingencies they hunger not be∣cause they are empty but because o∣thers are full Many would like their own Portion well enough if they had not seen another whose Portion they lik'd better  Ahab  might well have satisfy'd himself with the Kingdom of  Israel  had not  Na∣both  's Vineyard lay in his way  Haman  could find no Gust in all the Sensualities of the  Persian  Court because a poor de∣spicable  Jew  denies his Obeisance and thus every one of our Passions keeps us upon the Rack till they have obtain'd their Designs If we will create imagina∣ry Wants to our selves why do we not create an imaginary Satisfaction to them 'Twere the merrier Frenzy of the two to be like the mad  Athenian  who thought all the Ships that came into the Harbour his own than to be still tormenting our selves with unsatiable Desires For we generally find those that are farthest re∣mov'd from Want are so from Content too they take no notice of the real sub∣stantial Blessings they enjoy and go in quest after some fugitive Satisfaction  which like a Shadow flies still faster in proportion to their Pursuit A strange Folly thus to court Vexations and be miserable in Chimera We chew the Cud upon Gall and Wormwood and embitter our own Lives meerly by these imaginary Sufferings nor do we only fright our selves with Images of past Calamities but we lay romantick Scenes for Distresses and raise Alarms to our selves We do nicely and critically observe every little adverse Accident of our Lives and let a whole Current of Prosperity glide by without our Notice like little Children our Fingers are never off the sore Place till we have pick'd every light Scratch into an Ulcer Whereas if we cast up our Accounts justly we shall find our Receits have infinitely exceeded our Disburse∣ments and that for the few Mites of Obe∣dience we have pay'd to our Creator we have receiv'd Talents of Mercies from him but instead of entertaining our selves with the pleasanter Parts of God's Dis∣pensations to us we always pore upon the harsher and look upon our Misfor∣tunes through all the magnifying Opticks our Fancies can supply and we are so full of our selves that we can see nothing beyond it Every Man expects God should place him where he hath a Mind to be  and tho' we are apt to tax it as a great In∣justice in a Prince when he indulges any thing to a private Favourite to the pub∣lick Disadvantage yet so unequal are we that we murmur at God for not doing that which we murmur at Men for doing We must consider that other Men have the same Appetites with us and if we dislike an inferior State why should not we be∣lieve others do so too and we must not think God should be more concern'd to humour us than those Multitudes of o∣thers who have the same Desires Every Man would be above and superior and if no Man were below no Man could be above So in Wealth most Men desire more but every Man does at least desire to keep what he has how then shall one Part of the World be supply'd without the Diminution of the other unless there should be as miraculous a Multiplication of Treasure for Men's Avarice as there was of Loaves for their Hunger It was a good Answer which an Ambassador of an oppressed Province gave to  Anthony If O Emperor thou wilt have double Taxes from us thou must help us to double Springs and Harvests  And sure God must be at the Trouble of a new Creation make a double World if he should ob∣lige himself to satisfy all the unreasonable  Appetites of Men the Truth is we have generally in us the worser Part of the Le∣vellers Principles and tho' we can very contentedly behold Multitudes below us yet we are impatient to see any above us and thus we create Torments to our selves by our own Repinings which only sets us farther from our Aims  It is observable of the first two Kings of  Israel  who were of God's immediate Ele∣ction that he surpriz'd them with that Dignity when they were about a mean Imployment the one seeking his Father's Asses the other keeping his Father's Sheep and surely he that sits down with this Ac∣quiescence is a happier Man than he that enjoys the greatest Worldly Splendor but infinitely more so than he who impatient∣ly covets what he cannot attain for such a Man puts himself upon a perpetual Rack keeps his Appetites up to the utmost Stretch and yet hath nothing wherewith to satisfy them for either we are trou∣bled for the Want of something we desire or at the suffering something we would avoid And there is no Man who sober∣ly recollects the Events of his Life but must confess that he hath sometimes de∣sir'd Things that would have been to his Mischief if he had had them and on the other side when he has obtain'd what he desir'd  it hath been to him a Punishment rather than a Satisfaction whereas by our Acquiescence under the Ills we suffer the Bitterness is taken off from all our Af∣flictions there being nothing which so much purifieth us if we do not frustrate their Efficacy by our irregular Manage∣ment under them  Afflictions wean us from the World we read in the Story of the Deluge so long as the Earth was covered with Waters the very Raven was contented to take shelter in the Ark but when all was fair and dry even the Dove finally forsook it and it is much so with us the worst of Men will commonly in Distress have Re∣course to God when the best of us are apt to forget him in the Blandishments of Prosperity We should not therefore give our Hearts to any external Thing but let all the Concerns of the World hang loose about us whereby we shall quit them in∣sensibly whenever they are call'd for We must not look to be carried into Heaven upon Beds of Ivory nor from the Noise of Harps and Viols to be immediately wrap'd up into the Choir of Angels We may certainly often find that those Events which we have entertain'd with Regret have in the Consequences been very be∣neficial to us of which I am still a living  Testimony for all the good Fortune and Promotion which by their late Majesties Grace and Favour I attain'd to was oc∣casioned only by the Dexterity I then shew'd in giving such good Account of Affairs abroad whilst I was then in Prison at  Bruges  Nay sometimes the Inhuma∣nity of a Man's Relations are the Occasi∣on of his Advantage thus the barbarous Malice of  Joseph  's Brethren was the first Step to his Dominion over  Egypt  and it is a common Observation in Families that the most discouraged Children usually prove better than the Darlings and there is nothing more ordinary than for that which one esteems a great Calamity to be∣come the Foundation of our future Hap∣piness  A low Condition is a terrible thing in Sound and Opinion and that's all Some Men are banisht and stript of their Estates others are poor in Plenty which is the basest sort of Beggary for to spare of what a Man hath not only what he may need but what he doth need is not only to walk with a Man's Horse in his Hand but to carry the Saddle too and of the two it is a great deal better to die a Beg∣gar than to live a Beggar We usually condemn Villains to the Mines and he that labours first to get Mony and then  locks up his Mony from himself condemns both himself and it but again to the Mines as if he envied both their very Being a∣bove Ground Poverty is not a thing to be wisht no more than War but if it be our Lott we must bear our Misfortunes as becomes wise and honest Men we do not pray for War but for Generosity and Cou∣rage in all the Extremities of War if it hap∣pens Afflictions are but the Exercises of Virtue and an honest Man is out of his Element when he is idle It is a common Argument against the Justice of Provi∣dence in the matter of Reward and Pu∣nishment the Misfortunes of good Men in this World and the Prosperity of the wicked but alas Misfortunes come by Divine Appointment and to those that are good Men even for that very Reason because they are good Prosperity shews a Man but one Part of humane Nature no Body knows what such a Man's good for neither in Truth doth he understand himself for want of Experiment Tem∣poral Happiness is for weak and vulgar Minds but Calamity is the Touchstone of a brave Mind that resolves to live and die free and Master of it self and Adver∣sity is best for us for it is God's Mercy to shew the World their Errors and that the things they fear and covet are neither  good nor evil being the common and pro∣miscuous Lott both of good Men and bad if they were good only the good should enjoy them and if bad only the wicked should suffer them A wise Man carries all his Treasure within himself and what Fortune gives she may take but he leaves nothing at her Mercy He stands firm and keeps his Ground against all Misfortunes with∣out so much as changing Countenance he is Proof against all Accidents He is a Friend to Providence and will not mur∣mur at any thing that comes to pass by God's Appointment and never any Man was broken by Adversity that was not first betrayed by Prosperity The Truth is we are generally mistaken in the Nature of Good and Evil and have not the true Measures of it that is truly good which makes a Man the better and that truly evil which makes a Man the worse if Pro∣sperity makes me thankful munificent and humble then 'tis good for me and makes me better but if it makes me proud 'tis evil for me If Adversity makes me cla∣morous and murmur 'tis ill for me but if it makes me humble sober and patient then 'tis good and let every Man impar∣tially take the Measure of the very same Man in each Condition he shall find ten to one receive more Mischief by Prosperi∣ty  than Adversity There is a strange Witchcraft in Prosperity which gets ground upon our Mind and Virtue espe∣cially upon our Humility for Worldly Grandeur secretly steals away that Vir∣tue and impairs it sooner than any other Pride is the Devil that usually haunts and waits upon Worldly Greatness How ma∣ny Men have we seen that under the greatest Pressures and Calamities of Po∣verty and Reproach have yet kept up their Reputation but in the warm Beams and Sunshine of Prosperity have cast off their Goodness as the Traveller did his Cloak in the Fable and became as great Oppressors and debauch'd Livers as if they had never heard of Heaven or Hell True Humility is a great Guard upon the Soul of a Man against these Rocks and Hazards an humble Man looks upon all his Prosperity and Plenty not as his own but as it is the Disposition of the great Master of the Family of Heaven and Earth Talents entrusted to him as a Steward to employ for his Master's Ser∣vice and Honour and not for his own Grandeur and Pleasure Our Vices are the Vermin that are commonly bred in us by the warm Influences of Prosperity  We do not compare the Good of others with our Good nor their Evil with our  Evil but with an envious Curiosity we amass together all the desirable Circum∣stances of our Neighbour's Condition and with a prying Discontent we ransack all our Grievances and confront to them this is but a thin Piece of Sophistry and we change the Scene we compare our Neighbours and our selves in Point of Mortality where we make his Vices as much exceed ours as our Calamities did his in the other Instance However this is the pleasanter kind of Deceit for a Man hath some Joy in thinking himself less wick∣ed than his Neighbour but no Comfort in thinking himself more miserable Indeed if we could use our Eyes aright and see Things in their true Shapes a Competen∣cy would be more pleasing than Abun∣dance and the envy'd Pomp of Princes when ballanc'd with the Cares and Ha∣zards annex'd would rather make a wise Man fear than desire Preferment and if a Man well understood the Right he would rather chuse to wield a Flail than a Scepter and indeed there is no greater Unhappiness than the fond Admiration of other Mens Enjoyments and Contempt of our own But if we would begin at the right end and look with as much Com∣passion on the Adversities of others as we do with Envy at their Prosperities  every Man would find Cause to sit down contentedly with his own Burthen  David  the Man after God's own Heart was no less signal for his Afflictions than for his Piety he was sometime an Exile from his Country and after being settled in his Throne what a Succession of Ca∣lamities had he in his own Family the incestuous Rape of his Daughter the Re∣taliation of that by the Murder of  Am∣mon  and that seconded by the rebellious and barbarous Conspiracy of  Absalon  his Expulsion from  Jerusalem  the base Re∣vilings of  Shimei  and lastly the Loss of his darling Son in the Act of his Sin It is an illnatur'd thing for any Man to think himself more miserable because another is happy and yet it is this thing alone by which many Men have made themselves wretched having created Wants to them∣selves from the envious Contemplation of other Mens Abundance Whenever God administers to us a bitter Cup we may be sure the Ingredients are medicinal and such as our Infirmities require he durst not trust our intemperate Appetites with unmix'd Prosperities the Lascivousness whereof tho' it may please our Palates yet it may engender most fatal Diseases But alas we do not understand our own Interest because we do not rightly under∣stand  what we are our selves We con∣sider our selves meerly in our animal Be∣ing our Bodies and when we are in∣vaded there we think we are undone tho' that Breach be made only to retrieve that diviner Part within us oppress'd with the Flesh about it for our Body is to our Soul but as a Garment to the Body a de∣sent Case and Cover and certainly he must be a mad Man that would not rather have his Cloaths cut than his Flesh and we ought not to repine that our Souls are cured at the Cost of our Bodies and our impatient Resistances do only frustrate the medicinal Part of our Afflictions and our Murmur∣ings may ruin our Souls but will never a∣vert any of our outward Calamities  To make a right Estimate of this World we should consider it as a Stage and our selves but as Actors and to resolve that it is very little material what Part we play so we do it well a Comedian may get as much Applause by acting the Slave as the Conqueror and he that acts the one to Day may to Morrow reverse the Part and personate the other and certainly he that hath well imprest upon his Mind the Vanity and Vexation of the World can∣not be much surprised at any thing that be∣falls him in it We take the magnifying Glasses of Discontent when we view our  own Miseries and others Felicities but look upon our Enjoyments and their Suf∣ferings thro' the contracting Opticks of Ingratitude and Incompassion It is a very illnatured thing for any Man to think himself more miserable because another is happy and yet this is the very thing by which alone many Men have made them∣selves wretched creating Wants to them∣selves meerly from the envious Contem∣plation of other Mens Abundance  Lu∣cifer  was happy enough in his original State yet could not think himself so be∣cause he was not like the most High and by insolent Ambition forfeited his Bliss and those do perfectly transcribe his Copy who cannot be satisfied with any infe∣rior Degree of Prosperity but what their Impatiencies with other Mens Enjoyments of what they cannot attain God never articled with the Ambitious to give him Honours with the Covetous to fill his Bags with the Voluptuous to feed his Luxury if therefore we expect to be sa∣tisfied let us modestly confine our Desires within the Limits God hath set us and then every Accession which he superadds will appear a Bounty  The best Expedient for Contentment is to confine our Thoughts to the present We often heap fantastick Loads upon our  selves by anxious Presages of things which perhaps will never happen which is one of the greatest Follies imaginable for either the Evil will come or it will not if it will 'tis sure no such desirable Guest that we should go on to meet it we shall feel it time enough when it comes we need not anticipate our Sense of it but if it will not come what extream Madness is it for a Man to torment himself with that which will never be to create to himself Engines of Tortures and by such chimerical Afflictions make himself as miserable as the most real ones could do therefore let us rest our selves upon that admirable Aphorism of our Saviour's  sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof  A querilous repining Humour is one of the most pernicious Habits in∣cident to Mankind but yet as deform∣ed People are most often in Love with themselves so this crooked Piece of our Temper is of all others the most indul∣gent to it self it will nourish it self with Chimeras suborn a thousand ima∣ginary Distresses and is impatient of any Diversion loves to converse only with it self Men cherish this Disease of their Mind and improve their Torment roll and chew the bitter Pill in their Mouths and by devoting all Thoughts to the Sub∣ject  of their Grief keep up an uninter∣rupted Sense of it as if they had the same Tyranny for themselves which  Caligula  had for others and lov'd to feel them∣selves die This Word Calamity hath an ill Reputation in the World the very Name is more grievous than the thing it self what need any Man complain if he can turn that into a Happiness which o∣thers count a Misery a wise Man is ne∣ver surprised in the midst of Plenty he prepares for Poverty as a prudent Prince does for War in the Depth of Peace our Condition is good enough if we make the best on't and our Felicity is in our own Power Every Man should stand upon his Guard against Fortune and take heed to himself when she speaks him fairest A brave Man looks upon himself as a Citi∣zen a Soldier of the World in despite of Accidents and Oppositions he maintains his Station and is more ambitious of be∣ing reputed Good than Happy  Mutius  lost his Right Hand with more Honour than he could have preserved it he was a greater Conqueror without it than he could have been with it for with the very Stump of it he overcame two Kings  Tar∣quin  and  Porsenna Rutilia  follow'd  Cotta  into Banishment she staid and she return'd with him too and soon after she lost him  without so much as shedding a Tear a great Instance of her Courage in his Banishment and of her Prudence in his Death  Many Men have longer Intermissi∣ons from Afflictions than others yet none are totally exempt from them and that Man who hath lived to the ordinary Ex∣tent of the Age of Man will find his Crosses and Sufferings have outweighed the treasure of his Comforts in this Life The poor Man reckons it his Affliction that he wants Wealth and the rich Man is not without his Afflicti∣on either in the Loss of it or for fear of losing it  Men in Prosperity cannot suppose a Change in their Estates a healthful Man can hardly think of dying the Reason is that our present Condition falls under our present Sense and takes up our whole Consideration and things that are not yet are only present by Contemplation which does not so strongly affect the Mind because it hath not the like Strength of Impres∣sion upon the Mind as that which is present and sensible whereas an Ap∣prehension of a disadvantageous Change of our Condition admirably fills a Man with such a Temper of Spirit as be∣comes  his changed Condition But a Man in Prospetity that never puts him∣self under the sad Thoughts of a Change of his present Happiness if such a Change befalls him he is at his Wits end he is surprised and over∣whelmed with it being taken before he is prepar'd It is certain it is a very great Improvidence for a Man to be learning those Virtues when the pre∣sent Necessity calls for the Use of them it's like a Thief who is to learn to read when he is to pray his Clergy  Affliction doth not so much endan∣ger a good Man to lose his Innocence as Wealth and Honour do let any Man observe either in himself or others we are all equally the worse for Pro∣sperity and it is a far greater Diffi∣culty to manage a prosperous Fortune than a low and afflicted Condition and therefore those are securest from Affliction that use their Prosperity with Equality of Mind because they keep a Check upon their Corruptions and so stand in less need of this Physick for my Part I have quite forgot that ever I was prosperous and my ill For∣tune doth now the less trouble me and I can well and truly say with  Seneca    Stet quicunque volet potens  Auloe culmine lubrico  Me dulcis saturet quies  Obscuro positus loco  Leni perfruar otio  Illi mors gravis incubat  Qui notus nimis omnibus  Ignotus moritur sibi  Let him that will ascend the tott'ring Seat  Of courtly Grandeur and become as great  As are his mounting Wishes as for me  Let sweet Repose and Rest my Portion be  Give me some mean obscure Recess a Sphear  Out of the Road of Business or of Fear  Of falling lower where nothing may annoy  Or hinder my Retirement to enjoy  Death is a meer Surprise a very Snare  To him that makes his Life its greatest Care  To be a publick Pageant known to all  But unacquainted with himself doth fall  When  Job  was scraping his Sores up∣on the Dunghill he said  Lord when I was in Prosperity I heard thee but now in my Affliction I see thee  which shews nothing gives a more intimate Knowledge of God than to be sur∣rounded with Tribulation the Soul in  Prosperity grows proud deaf and care∣less so that she must smart in the Sen∣ses to be made sensible We are not to be wrought upon but when afflicted and in Misery  Jonas  in the Whale's Belly the Prodigal in the Pigsty the Sick in hi Feaver the Lascivious in his Sweat∣ingtub then they recollect themselves but when in Sports and Pastimes say∣ling in a Sea of Plenty and Delights all our Senses are shut up and no Pas∣sage open Solid Virtue like a Rose amidst Thorns seldom springs forth but in the Soil of Crosses Afflictions and Austerities Those Men are truly virtuous who take as it were with the same Relish the Gall of Misfortunes and the Honey of Prosperity No stormy Seasons hinder their Journey and that which distracts the soft and effeminate is to them Matter of Repose and Joy all Things that pass under the Name of Adversity are not so but to the wicked who make ill use of them in prising the Creature more than the Cre∣ator The Delay our blessed Saviour made in sending Succour to his Disci∣ples endanger'd by a Storm at Sea suf∣ficiently hints unto us the Pleasure God takes to see the Just row against the Stream tug and wrestle with all the  Force they can against the Storms and Afflictions of this World And there∣fore it is well observed that God laid open  Job  to all the Assaults of Satan but with this Reserve that he touch'd not his Life and this not in regard that Death would have eclipsed the Glo∣ry of that great Champion but because he would not be depriv'd of such a Com∣batant to whose Conflict God with his blessed Angels were intent with much Satisfaction and so would not lose the Pleasure of seeing that stout Skirmish fought to the last betwixt him and his Enemy and something to this Purpose St  Gregory Nyssen  declares upon God's proceeding with the  Israelites  in com∣manding them to set up a brazen Ser∣pent at the Sight of which those who should be bitten by those venomous Crea∣tures might immediately find their Cure and asking the Reason why God did not take a shorter Course by destroying all those Serpents which had given an end to the Plague he at last satisfies him∣self with this Reason that whilst the  Hebrews  beheld the sovereign Medica∣ment in casting up their Eyes to Heaven they might thereby have Oc∣casion to consider from whence they re∣ceived their Deliverance which other∣wise  that gross ungrateful People would soon have forgot so that to draw them to pay what they ow'd to his Goodness he was feign to lengthen out their Af∣flictions  Some Men are tired with whatever they have enjoyed in this World and ex∣pect no greater Satisfaction should they live a thousand Years every Pleasure appears but the same in different Forms and they all agree in leaving us afflicted with the same or greater Pain they found us in We walk here on Earth in an inchanted Castle of Shadows and Mock∣eries our whole Life is full of Vanity and Mistake every Man's Fortune is but a Repetition of  Ixion  's we court Clouds instead of Divinities and our most charming Fruitions consist in Emptiness  Resignation and Tranquility are the golden Mean and he that steps over this Line on one side or the other falls into the same Vanity which he bemoans or ridicules in the rest of Mortals I have perused many Books and convers'd with more Men yet none of them can inform me what I am my self for in this Life we are faign to peep into the World thro' the close Windows of our Senses which are so darkned with the  Dust our Passions raise besides the na∣tural Dulness of our Compositions that we are faign to use the Opticks of our Philosophy to help our Sight Yet after all we are still purblind and so are like to be during this mortal Life  Many great Princes have exchanged the toilsome Glory and royal Fatigues of Empire for the sweet Tranquility and Ease of a Country Farm and the whol∣some Exercises of Agriculture Thus  Dioclesian  quitted his Throne for the sake of a private Life and those Hands which had been accustomed to weild a Scepter became at last volunta∣rily familiar with the Spade the Plough and the Harrow So Grand  Cyrus  Mo∣narch of the  Persians  used to boast of the Gardens planted and sowed with his own Hands so may  Louis le Grand  well boast that he hath exceeded all his Predecessors nay even the Poets them∣selves in their best Descriptions in the Gardens and Waterworks he hath made at  Marly Versailles  and  Triannon  'Tis certain the  Fabii  the  Lentuli  the  Ci∣ceros  and  Pisoes  derived their Names from those kind of Vegetables which they signify and which their Fathers took delight in planting Was not  Abraham  a Herdsman and  Moses  the Prophet fa∣miliar  with God and  David  the Prince of Poets and the most illustrious He∣roes amongst the  Greeks  and  Romans  and other Nations were Keepers of Sheep Goats and Oxen and the  Ara∣bians  are so at this Day with the  Tar∣tars  and other Nations of the East  We are all subject to various Changes and Vicissitudes in this mortal State our Lives are alternatively chequered with Good and Evil Virtue and Vice have their Turns in the Series of most Mens Actions Prosperity and Adversity in the Course of our Lives and no Man can with Truth boast the contrary for we are all born to be Adventurers which happen in the Pellmell of humane Con∣versation  It is impossible to express to the Life the Pleasure that a Man feels in Solitude when free and undisturbed he can for many Hours behold the Motions of the Moon and Stars which raise pious Thoughts and Contemplations within his Breast his ravisht Soul is ready to break Prison with Joy when 'tis inspir'd with certain Demonstrations of Eter∣nity after which a Man is nauseated with the narrow Principles of ignorant Men and hates to profane his Reason with the vain Discourse of selfconceit∣ed  Fools and Ideots a Man is then cloy'd with Life and wishes to die amidst such charming Speculations  The Cast of an Eye many times disco∣vers the secret Sentiments of the Heart so does a shrug of the Shoulders a pout of the Lip or any other artificial Ge∣sture they are all significant and expres∣sive of what Affections and Thoughts we harbour within There are some se∣cret Characters in every Man's Face which speak the Nature of the Person we read the hidden Qualities of Men at the first Dash some Men have the very Signature of Virtue in their Faces and hence are lasting Friendships often con∣tracted  I have spent the Spring and Summer of my Life in Vanity Error and Igno∣rance 'tis time I should provide for the Winter of my Age a stock of solid Wis∣dom and Virtue  It is as natural for the vulgar to inveigh against generous Souls as 'tis for Dogs to bark at the Moon and yet that Planet is not moved at the Snarles of inviduous Animals so Souls truly no∣ble contemn the Censures of the inferi∣or Part of Men  God is pleas'd so to dispense his tem∣poral Blessings that he which hath least  hath enough not only to oblige his Ac∣quiescence but his Thankfulness tho' every Man hath not all he wishes yet he hath that which is more valuable than that he complains to want We must keep our Desires at home and not suf∣fer them to ramble at things without our Reach God hath placed none of us in so barren a Soil in so forlorn a State but there is something perhaps in it which may afford us Comfort But if in a sullen Humour we will not cultivate our own Field because we have per∣haps more mind to our Neighbour's we may thank our selves if we starve the despising of what God hath given us is but a cold Invitation to farther Bounty this complaining Humour is a Sickness of the Mind a perpetual Craving of the Appetite without any Possibility of Satisfaction and is the same in the Heart which the  Caninus apetitus  is in the Sto∣mach The Generality of Mankind be∣ing commonly made unhappy not by any thing without them but by those restless Impatiences that are within them And if  Israel  the Lott of God's own In∣heritance that People whom he had singled out from all the Nations of the World could forfeit God's Favour by their Unthankfulness sure none of us  can suppose we have any surer Entail to it As God loves a cheerful Giver so he loves a cheerful Receiver and we should soon leave off murmuring if we did but seriously consider that God owes us nothing and that whatever we receive is an Alms and not a Tribute  Diogenes  being asked what Wine drank the most pleasant answered  that which is drunk at another's Cost  and we can never miss of this Circumstance to re∣commend our good Things to us for be they little or much they come  gratis  It is the Character of an ill Nature to write Injuries in Marble and Bene∣fits in Dust and however some may acquit themselves of this Imputation as to Men yet none can do so in Relati∣on to God and tho' he neither will nor can do Injury yet we receive every cross Accident with great Resentment whilst his real Benefits are not at all observed 'Tis true some Men's Impatiences have risen so high as to cast away Life be∣cause it was not cloathed with all the Circumstances they wished and tho' in an angry Fit many Men have with  Jonas  wished to die yet ten to one should Death then come they would be as willing to resist it as was the Man in the  Apologue  who wearied with his  Burthen of Sticks flung it down and call'd for Death but when he came found no other Occasion for him but to be helpt up again with his Bundle 'Tis certain our Repinings proceed not from any Defect of God's Bounty but from the malignant Temper within us and as it is an easier thing to satisfie the Cravings of a hungry Appetite than to cure the nauseous Recoilings of a surfeited Sto∣mach so certainly the Discontents of the poor are more easier allay'd than those of the rich the Indigence of the one hath contracted his Desires into a narrow Compass but the other who hath his Desires stretched and extend∣ed is capable of no Satisfaction Alas our Body with all its Enjoyments is but the lowest Instance of God's Boun∣ty 'tis but a decent Case for that ine∣stimable Jewel within it the Soul like the Ark is the thing for which this whole Tabernacle was fram'd The more intellectual Powers wherewith it is indued have exercised the Curiosity and rais'd the Admiration of the great Con∣templators of Nature in all Ages and tho' the simplest Man knows he has the Faculties of Imagination Apprehensi∣on Memory and Reflection yet the learnedst cannot affirm where they are  seated or by what Means they operate And considering whereof we are made our Preservation is no less a Work of Omnipotence than our first framing nay perhaps 'tis rather a greater for we have now the Principles of Decay within us which tend to Dissolution we want the Supplies of several things without us the Failing whereof returns us again to our Dust The Air which refreshes us may at another time starve us the Meat that nourishes us may choak us nay there is no Creature so inconsider∣able which does not at some times serve us and which may not at any time if God permit ruin us and if the di∣vine Providence did not draw out the better Properties of these Creatures for our Use and restrain the worser for our Security we should quickly return to our Dust And if the ebbing and flowing of the Sea put the Philosopher into such an Extasie that he flung him∣self into it because he could not com∣prehend the Cause of it in what perpe∣tual Raptures of Admiration may we be who have every Minute within us and about us more and greater Won∣ders in our Favour when we deserve the Divine Power should rather exert it self in our Destruction  Aristippus  being bemoan'd for the Loss of a Farm reply'd with some sharpness upon his Condoler  You have but one Field and I have three left why should I not rather grieve for you  intimating That a Man is not so much to Estimate what he hath lost as what he hath left and we may easi∣ly be convinced that even in our worse Estate our Enjoyments are more than our Sufferings and God's Acts of Grace do outnumber those of his Severity to us  There is no Man that can with Rea∣son affirm himself to be the most un∣happy Man there being innumerable Di∣stresses of others which he knows not of Many Sorrows may lie at the Heart of him that carries a smiling Face and many a Man has been an Object of Envy to those who look only on the Outside who yet to those that know his private Griefs appears more worthy of Compas∣sion  Solon  seeing his Friend much op∣pressed with Grief carried him to the Top of a Tower that overlook'd the City of  Athens  and shewing him all the Buildings said to him  Consider how many Sorrows have do and shall in fu∣ture Ages inhabit under all those Roofs and do not vex thy self with those Incon∣veniencies which are common to Morta∣lity  as if they were only yours  It was the saying of  Socrates That if there were a common Bank made of all Men's Troubles most Men would chuse rather to take those they brought than to ven∣ture upon a new Dividend but think best to sit down with their own  He is an ill Member of a Community who in Publick Assessments will shuffle off all Payments and he is no better who in this common Tax which God hath laid upon our Nature is not content to bear his share A sick Fortune produces wholsome Counsels and we reap this Fruit by adverse Fortune that it brings us at last to Wisdom whereas prospe∣rous Fortune like a strong Gale upon a strong Current carries a Man in a trice out of the sight of Quiet and if it be not well regulated it is so far from easing us that it proves an Oppression to us and a busie fortunate Man in the World calls many his Friends that were at most but his Guests and Men flock to him as they do a Fountain in hot Weather both to exhaust and trouble him  Of WOMEN  T  HERE is much to be said in the Praise and Dispraise of Women as we are Rid∣dles to our selves so that Sex is in a much higher de∣gree Mysterious for Women have Ways by themselves unknown to Men their Windings and Turnings are as intricate as those of Serpents and if  Daedalus  were now alive tho' once the Glory of Labyrinthmakers he would be trou∣bled to trace Women in all their secret wild unknown Maeanders and yet it is clear that Womens Inclinations are not only oftentimes better but their Re∣solutions greater than Mens and it is observ'd that as they are generally more virtuous than Men so when they deviate to Vice they are more hardned in it  The great Actions in which they have born a part speak the Excellencies of their Nature  Judith  in Sacred Writ is remembred with great Glory and  Lu∣cretia  in the  Roman  History by her Re∣solution hath raised her self an eternal  Monument neither must that Noble Vir∣gin  Clelia  be forgot who being given in Hostage to King  Porsenna  at the Siege of  Rome  she escaped her Guards by Night and mounting a Horse she found in the way she swam over the  Tyber  in∣to  Rome  whereupon and upon what  Mutius  had a little before done and said  Porsenna  as if terrified by the stupen∣dious Resolution of the  Romans  con∣sented to a Peace  And tho' some out of Wantonness of Wit and Extravagancy of Paradoxes have called the Abilities of Women in question yet those Abilities best appear∣ing in Matters of Religion and Govern∣ment we are in neither of these with∣out Examples of able Women The last Age gave us so great a Queen for Go∣vernment as scarce any former King did equal and this Age such a QueenDowager to our late King that if  Plu∣tarch  were again in being to write Lives by Parallels he would not find for her Majesty a Parallel amongst Women since no Age hath seen her Equal for Beauty Piety Virtue Generosity and other most Eminent Abilities and Princely En∣dowments  The World indeed which is no just Judge will scarce allow Women to be Wise and because they are generally commended enough for other Qualities the World therefore delights to lessen on one Side what it is forced to allow on the other For we usually find in Women a Delicacy of Wit not common to Men neither are Men's Actions com∣monly attended with so much Graceful∣ness as Womens and Ladies are more skilful than Men in what they do whether it be the Advantage of pleasing be more Natural to them or that finding their great Strength to lie there they make it more their Study from their Child∣hood And where Women have sub∣mitted themselves to as good Education as Men their Sex hath not prejudiced them from being great Examples to o∣thers and this Sex hath always been esteem'd and found by the  English  wor∣thy of Empire and when it hath been enthron'd it hath bestow'd great Feli∣city upon the Nation neither hath it given Place to the other Sex for illustri∣ous Qualities and the highest Virtues  In the  Venetian  Story we find certain Matrons of that City were sent in Qua∣lity as Ambassadresses to an Emperor with whom that State had occasion to  treat And in the  Eastern  Parts of the World it's usual for Women to be Am∣bassadresses and in Affairs of Religion Women have ever had a great Hand tho' sometimes on the Left as well as the Right sometimes their abundant Wealth sometimes their Personal Affe∣ctions to Churchmen and sometimes their indiscreet Zeal many times the Voices of great Men both in Civil and Ecclesiastical Assemblies have been in the Power and Disposition of Women And hence it is that in the old Epistles of some Popes we find as many Letters of those Popes to the Emperors Wives Mothers and Sisters as to the Emperors themselves  It would be a kind of unpardonable Envy to conceal some other Excellen∣cies of Women and the Advantages they have of us in many Respects Some  He∣brew  Doctors from the different Names of  Adam  and  Eve  draw Arguments to prove the Dignity and Perfection of the Female Sex in that  Adam  signifies Earth but  Eve  expresses Life And they affirm That every Name which God impos'd on any thing describes its Nature and Quality as a Picture represents the Ori∣ginal and therefore by how much Life is to be esteemed more than Earth by  so much more excellent in the Opinion of these  Rabins  is Woman than Man They endeavour to strengthen this Opi∣nion by shewing that God having made Man and then survey'd the System of his Works found nothing more excel∣lently and divinely fram'd than Woman and therefore in her rested and commen∣ced the Sabbath as if he could not make the Idea of another Creature more per∣fect than her or as if he did not esteem the Universe it self compleat without the last and most accomplish'd of his Works And as the End is always first in the Intention and last in Execution Woman therefore being the last Work of the Creation it is thereby evident that she was the chief Design and Aim God Almighty had in building this im∣mense Fabrick which he furnish'd and adorn'd with infinite Riches and De∣lights and then introduced  Eve  as into her Native proper Place there to reign as absolute Queen over all his Works And besides the particular Place of her Creation does much exalt her in that she was formed in Paradice amongst the Angels whereas  Adam  was made in the common Waste amongst the Brutes But the most prevailing Argument is from the stupendious Beauty of that Sex  which like finer sorts of Clouds in Sum∣mer seem to ingross the Splendor of the Sun and to reflect his Beams on the World How matchless is indeed a Wo∣man's Form What dazzling Majesty en∣virons her from Hand to Foot Can you gaze on her lovely Countenance without Astonishment or fix your Eyes upon her without an Extasie Indeed so admirable is the Figure Voice and Mein of a beautiful Woman that he is wilfully Blind who does not see what∣ever Beauties the whole World is capa∣ble of are concentred in that Sex Yet after all this they have their dark Side too like the rest of mixed Beings They are the Frontier Passes of the World a∣bove and of that below the Gates of Life and Death the very Avenues to Heaven or Hell according as they are used like Fire they will warm and re∣fresh a Man if he keeps at a due di∣stance but if he approach too near they scorch and blister him or like the other Element of Water they are very good and serviceable whilst kept within their Bounds but let them once break down the Banks of Modesty they'll threaten all with Ruin In a word It is neither safe to Vex them in the least or Humour them too much the excess  of Fondness as well as the defect of natural Love may equally undo us Prudent Generosity is the only Method of making our selves happy in the En∣joyment of them The frequent and familiar Converse Women are allow'd with Men within the Bounds of Mo∣desty both in  England  and  France  is a great Advantage to them and cer∣tainly the  Italians  and  Spaniards  in their so great strictness to this Sex do much Err for besides the Injustice they act in depriving them of that Liberty which God and Nature allows them it is im∣possible they should ever become more Virtuous by being confin'd to the Melan∣cholly of a Cloister which must neces∣sarily indulge and minister loose Thoughts when if they converst in the World they might improve themselves by Know∣ledge and the Diversions they would receive from the Company of others which would keep them from thinking of Ill so frequently  The present  Jews  of this Age and  Turks  have an odd Opinion of Women believing they are of an inferior Crea∣tion to Man and therefore they exclude them the first from their Synagogues the other from their Mosques which is not only Partial but Profane for the  Image of the Creator shines as clearly if not more in the one as in the other and I believe there are as many Female Angels in Heaven as Males though in Heaven there be many Mansions to which may be added that there went better and more refined Atoms to the Creation of Woman than there did of Man  'Tis true it was a weak Part in  Eve  to yield to the Seducements of the Ser∣pent but it was a weaker Thing in  Adam  to be tempted by  Eve  who was the weaker Vessel The Ancient Philoso∣phers had a better Opinion of that Sex they ascribed all Sciences to the Muses all Sweetness and Morality to the Graces and Prophetick Inspirations to the Si∣bylls and we find in all Authors high Examples of the Virtues of Women And if they did but consider what an Ascendant they have upon Men and that tho' they were the Source of all our Miseries yet we still adore them they would be something more complacent for it is certainly a sign of good Nature to be amorous of Women and he is look'd upon as a Monster or degene∣rate Person who feels no Warmths of Passions for that lovely Sex Women were sent into the World on purpose  as many think to blow up those gentle Flames which sublimate our grosser Mould and make us more refined The Love of Women is riveted in our Na∣ture and our Blood must first grow Cold before this Flame can be extinguished nay many times it is more fervent tho' of a short Duration in our latest Hours than in our Prime As when the Oil which feeds a Lamp is almost spent the startled Flame begins to rouze it self and burn afresh as if it would feign subsist a little longer and then it crackles and flashes with greater Noise and Lustre than before but presently expires so does this Amorous Fire when we are nearest our Dissolution begin to trou∣ble us most and makes our Souls blaze with Fevers of Desire and Grief know∣ing its Period is near I know some Women are as Shadows the more you follow them the faster they fly from you and they are of that odd Humour that to feed their Pride they will starve those Natural Passions which are owing from them to Men I confess Coyness be∣comes some Beauties if handsomely acted and a Frown from some Faces penetrates more than the soft Glances of a mincing Smile but if this Coy∣ness or those Frowns savour of Pride  they are odious if not ridiculous for it is a true Rule where this kind of Pride inhabits Honour sits not long Porter at the Gate  There are indeed some Beauties so strong that no Batteries can do any good upon them there are others that are tenable a good while but will incline to Parley at last and that Fort which begins to Parley is half won For my own Part I think of Women what  Phi∣lip  of  Macedon  thought of Cities There is none so Inexpugnable but an Ass laden with Gold may enter into it and as the  Spaniards  say Presents may rend Rocks Pearls and golden Bullets may do much upon the most impregnable Beauty that is And yet I knew an  English  Lord that sent a little Dog to a Lady he esteem'd much with a rich Collar of Diamonds she took the Dog but re∣turn'd the Collar but what effect it wrought after I cannot say 'Tis a powerful Sex they were too strong for the first the strongest and the wisest Man that ever was and yet for all their Strength in Point of Value the  Ita∣lian  says I will not say truly That a Man of Straw is worth a Woman of Gold In fine the best Advice I can give in this Case is When Women are  perverse retire handsomely there be∣ing as much Honour to be got in a hand∣some Retreat as in a hot Pursuit and by this Retreat you will get a greater Victory than you think of for you will Overcome your self which is the grea∣test Conquest that can be made  Those do great wrong to Ladies that esteem them unable to govern a State since History tells us That the Female Sex is not only worthy to bear the Scepter but that Ladies have pre∣served and enlarged the Kingdoms of  Spain England Denmark  and  Swe∣den  who never flourished so much as under the two  Elizabeths Margaret  and  Christina  Never King of  England  was better obey'd than Queen  Elizabeth  the Commanders freely acknowledg'd their Victories proceeded as much from the happy Genius of their Queen as from their own Valour And  Elizabeth  of  France  Wife to  Philip  IV would have reestablished the Affairs of  Spain  if the Impertinency of a Favourite had not held her at a distance from the Councils of the King her Husband They are not all sufficiently qualified to Rule neither are Men There are but few Women indeed because the Malice or Envy of Men keeps them off from  shewing their Abilities and making their Prudence and Generosity admired and if there were as many Women as Princes upon the Throne we should often find Female Accomplishments superior to ours there being many Ladies worthy to Govern and would be many more if they were instructed and brought up to great Affairs from their younger Years  On the Knowledge of God and a∣gainst Atheism  W  ITH whatsoever other Knowledge a Man may be endued he is but ignorant who does not know God the Duty he owes Him and the way to praise Him who can make him happy or miserable for ever Tho' a Man could know all that Nature or Art requires could attain to a Maste∣ry in all Languages and sound the Depths of all Arts and Sciences could discover the Interests of all States the Intrigues of all Courts the Reasons of all civil Laws and Constitutions and give an Account of the History of all Ages and yet should want the Know∣ledge of God All this would be but an impertinent Vanity and a glittering kind of Ignorance Such a Man would be undone with all his Knowledge and be like the Philosopher who gazing upon the Stars fell into the Ditch For true  Wisdom regards our own Interest and he is not a wise Man who does not take Care of his own Concerns  Nothing can more effectually under∣mine the Foundation of our Happiness than to banish the Belief of a God out of the World for if there were no God Man would be in a worse Condition than Beasts who are only sensible of pre∣sent Pain and when it is upon them they bear it as they can not being ap∣prehensive of Evils at a Distance nor tormented with the Prospect of what may befal them hereafter but Man is liable to these Evils and many others which are so much the greater because they are aggravated by the sharp Re∣flections of our own Thoughts and if there be no God we are wholly with∣out Comfort and without any other Re∣medy than what Time will give But if we believe there is a God that takes Care of us this must be a mighty Com∣fort to us both under our present Af∣fliction and the Apprehension of Evils at a Distance for in that Case we are se∣cure that either God by his Providence will prevent the Evils we fear or will support us under them when they come or will make them the Occasion of a greater good to us by turning them  either to our Advantage in this World or the Encrease of our Happiness in the next  Atheism hath struck on a sudden into such a Reputation that it scorns any lon∣ger to sculk but shews it self more Pub∣lickly than most Men dare do the con∣trary nothing passes for Wit that hath not its Stamp and with it there is no Metal of so base Alloy but will go cur∣rant every dull Man that can but stout∣ly disdain his Maker hath by it secured his Title to Ingenuity And yet it is im∣possible for any Man who sees only the smallest part of the Universe to doubt of a Free and Supream Being untill by the Sense of his Wickedness it becomes his Interest there should be none for certainly there never was any Man who said there was no God but he wished it first  'Twas good Counsel given to the  A∣thenians  to be very careful  Philip  of  Macedon  was dead before they exprest their Joy at his Death least they might find him alive to revenge their hasty Tri∣umph and so let the Atheists be sure there is no God before they presume thus to defie him least they find him at last as∣sert his Being in their Destruction  The great Mystery of Atheism is that Men are wedded to their Lusts and are resolved upon a wicked Course and so it becomes their Interest to wish there were no God and to believe so if they can so that nothing but the Power of vicious Inclinations sways Mens Minds towards Atheism and when Mens Judgments are once byass'd they do not believe according to the Evidence of Things but according to their Humour and Interest for when Men live as if there were no God it becomes expe∣dient for them that there should be none and then they endeavour to persuade themselves so and are glad to find Ar∣guments to fortifie themselves in that Persuasion  That there have been many false Gods devised is rather an Argument that there is a true One than that there is none There would be no Counterfeits but for the sake of something that's real For tho' all Pretenders seem to be what they really are not yet they pretend to be something that really is There would be no Brass Money if there were not good and lawful Money  Bristol  Stones would not pretend to be Diamonds if there never had been any Diamonds Those two great Counterfeits  Lambert  Simuel  and  Perkin Warbeck  had never been set up in  Henry  VII's Time if there had not once been a real  Plantagenet  and Duke of  York  So the Idols of the Heathens tho' they were set up in Af∣front to the true God yet they rather prove there is One than the contrary  It is evident to common Sense that Man is not sufficient of himself to his own Happiness he is liable to many Miseries which he can neither prevent nor redress He is full of Wants which he cannot supply and of Infirmities which he cannot remove and obnoxious to Dangers against which he cannot pro∣vide Consider a Man without God's Protection and he is sure of nothing he enjoys and uncertain of every thing he hopes for He Grieves for what he can∣not help Desires what he cannot obtain Courts Happiness which flies from him the farther he pursues it His Hopes and Expectations are bigger than his En∣joyments his Fears and Jealousies more troublesome than the Evils themselves So that the Atheist deprives himself of all Comfort that the Apprehensions of a God can give a Man and yet is liable to all the Trouble and Disgust of those Apprehensions  Of RELIGION  M  OST People take up their Religion for a Fashion and receive it according to the Country where they are born and are therefore of that Religion and the Reason why we are  Christians  rather than  Jews Turks  or  Heathens  is because Christian Religion had the Fortune to come first in our Way and bespeak us at our Entrance into the World The Christian Religion may make  Archymedes  's Challenge Give it but where it may set its Foot allow but a sober Advertence to its Proposals and it will move the whole World It comes with most convincing Arguments but these must first obtain Attention before they can force Assent They will most infallibly weigh down the Scales if you try and examine their weight  But it's to be fear'd we are so stupid and unconcern'd that all the persuasive Rhetorick of the Gospel will make no Impression upon us all the Avenues of our Reason are so blocked up that they will find no way of approaching We are like the  Indian  Serpents  Philostratus  mentions Proof against all Charms but such as with their glittering Splendor assault our Eyes Nothing moves us but what courts our Senses and what is not gross enough to be seen we think too nice to be consider'd The Form and Name of Christianity Men find rea∣dy to their Hands and it costs them no Labour to call themselves Christians as they do  French  or  English  only be∣cause they were born within such a Territory and have taken up their Re∣ligion as part of their Fate the Temper of their Climate the Entail of their Ancestors the Profession of it descends to them by way of Inheritance and like young careless Heirs they are never at the Charge to Survey it to inform them∣selves of the Revenues of it what Bur∣then it lies under or what Advantages it promises  It is to be fear'd that of those vast Mul∣titudes that have entred the Baptismal  Vows most of them weigh it as little when they should perform it as they did when they made it and have no other Notion of Baptism but as a Cu∣stom of the Place or a Time of Feast∣ing and consider no farther Significan∣cy in those Spiritual Bonds than they did in their Swadling Cloaths and can give no better account why they took on them Christ's Livery than why they wear such Garments as the common Fashion of the Country prescribes them But where Men are so Ignorant it must necessarily infer their Parent's Negli∣gence either in not infusing or their own stubborn Perverseness in resisting Instruction But it is more probable to conclude the former since if Children were early instructed Knowledge would insensibly insinuate it self before their Years had arm'd them with Obstinacy enough to make Head against it And when by the Parent's Remissness the proper Seedtime is lost the Soil grows stiff and untractable the Labour of Learning averts their Childhood and the Shame of it their Manhood and they grow old in their Ignorance and are ready to leave the World before they come to know any thing of that  which is to succeed it This is a com∣mon and despicable Case which loudly accuses their Parents who thus wretch∣edly hazard their Children's greatest Concernment And as it was a Fault in their Parents to let their Children want those necessary Infusions 'tis sure∣ly so in themselves to let their riper Years continue in that Ignorance ha∣ving scarce ever thought of their Reli∣gion since they cou'd their Lesson to avoid Correction And then 'tis no wonder if they pass in the same Forget∣fulness with other the Occurrences of that slippery Age But if to some their Memory hath been so faithful as to re∣tain those early Impressions which were made in it yet alas it avails little for a Man's Remembrance of his Creed may tell him there is a God and that he is Almighty but if his Reason be so much asleep as not to infer from thence the Necessity of Reverencing and Obey∣ing him he may repeat the Creed eve∣ry Day and yet be an Atheist  The Difficulty of removing what is imprinted in us by Education is very hard that which Men take in by Edu∣cation being next to that which is Na∣tural and most Men owe the Principles  of their Religion to their Education or Climate wherein they were Born being bred up either to confirm those Principles their Parents instilled into them or by a general Consent proceed in the Religion of their Country there being a Geography of Religions as well as Lands and every Climate is not on∣ly distinguish'd by their Laws and Li∣mits but circumscribed by their Do∣ctrines not considering whether true or false but only according to their Interest And if we consider the Lives of most Men of all Conditions we shall find the Honours and Pleasures of the World which we renounced in Bap∣tism are the very Gods which share the World amongst us  Tho' we have seen Overturnings of States and Kingdoms and great Chan∣ges yet the true Church that adores that God that was ever ador'd subsists without Interruption and that Religion which hath always been opposed still subsists It hath many a Time been al∣most extinguished yet God hath al∣ways been pleas'd to raise and recover it by Wonders of his Goodness and Power and what is also very obser∣vable is That it hath never submitted  to yield or bow to the Will of Ty∣rants Let us but take a serious View of the Apostles chosen by  Jesus Christ  Those Persons that were Ignorant and Unlearned of a suddain were found sufficiently able to put to Silence the wisest Philosophers and Courageous enough to oppose the greatest Kings or Tyrants that resisted the Christian Re∣ligion which they Taught and Preach'd If we see a Miracle say some Men we would be Converted they think there is no more in Conversion but to believe there is a God when the De∣vil does that and trembles but true Conversion consists in Humbling our selves before the Saviour of the World whom we have so often Povoked and who might justly every Minute destroy us to confess we can do nothing without him and that we have deser∣ved nothing but his Displeasure It consists in acknowledging that there is a great Enmity betwixt God and us and without a Mediator we could have had no Access nor Favour  I know very well that good Men may and often do blemish the Repu∣tation of their Piety by overacting some Things in Religion by an un∣grateful  Austerity and Sourness which Religion does not require a substan∣tial discreet and unaffected Piety makes no great Noise nor Shew but expresses it self in a constant serious Devotion accompanied with good Works and Kindness which makes a Man pleasing both to God and his Neighbour Reli∣gion makes Men obedient to Govern∣ment and conformable to Laws it makes Men Peaceable to each other it heals the Natures of Men and sweetens their Spirits it corrects their Passions and mortifies all those Lusts which are the Causes of Enmity and Divisions If Men would live as Religion requires they should do the World would be a quiet Habitation And the true Rea∣son why the Societies of Men are so full of Tumult and Disorder is Be∣cause there is so little true Religion a∣mongst them so that if it were not for some small Remainders of Piety and Virtue which are yet scatter'd amongst Mankind humane Society would in a short Time disband and run into Con∣fusion the Earth would grow wild and become a great Forest and Men would turn Beasts of Prey one towards the other So that Religion hath so great  an Influence upon the Felicity of Man that it ought to be upheld out of Re∣gard to their Temporal Peace and Pro∣sperity as well as to their Eternal Religion does qualify all Sorts of Men and makes them in Publick Affairs the more Serviceable Governors apter to Rule with Conscience and Inferiors for Conscience Sake the willinger to Obey And it is a great Truth That all Du∣ties are by so much the better perform'd by how much the Men are more Reli∣gious from whose Abilities the same proceed and if Magistrates who are employ'd about the Publick Admini∣stration of Justice follow it only as a Trade for Gain'sSake the Formality of Justice will then only serve to smo∣ther Right and that which was neces∣sarily ordain'd for the common Good will be the Cause of common Mise∣ry  Religion has a Superiority above all other Things and is as necessary to our living Happy in this World as it is to our being Saved in the next with∣out it a Man is an abandon'd Creature one of the worst Beasts Nature hath produced and fit only for the Society of Wolves and Bears and therefore in  all Ages it hath been the Foundation of Government  nd therefore as no∣thing is better for being Soure it would be hard Religion should be so which is the best of Things and is so Cheerful and so far from being al∣ways at odds with good Humour that it is inseparably united to it and no∣thing of Unpleasantness belongs to it A Virtue stuck with Bristles is too rough it must be adorned with some Flowers or else it will be unwillingly entertained so that even where it may be fit to Strike do it gently and where one takes Care to do it he would wound others more and hurt himself less by soft Strokes than by being harsh and violent  Most People keep to that Religion which is grown up with them think∣ing that the best and the Reason of staying in it upon that Ground is somewhat stronger for Women than will be allow'd for Men who are bound to search the Truth  Tho' Kings be Gods on Earth yet they are Subjects of Heaven and ac∣countable to God Religion in a King strengthens his Authority it procures Veneration and gains a Reputation  and in all Publick Affairs so much Reputation is really so much Power and even in Men of low Degree Re∣ligion will command some Reverence and Respect But in Persons of emi∣nent Place and Dignity it casts a Lu∣stre upon them and by a strong Re∣flection doubles the Beams of Majesty as the clearness of the Eye disposes for a quicker Sight so the clearness of the Mind disposes us to more perfect Acts of Religion Few Things are well learnt but by easy Precepts those well infused will make them Natural and we are never sure of retaining what is valuable till by continual Ha∣bit we have made it a Piece of us  We must not think the Rewards of Heaven like ripe Fruit upon a full laden Bough should stoop down to us to be taken by every idle and wanton Hand That Heaven should be prosti∣tuted to the lazy Desires and ordinary Endeavours of Slothful Men God will not so much disparage eternal Life and Happiness as to bestow it upon those who have so low an Opinion of it as not to think it worth taking Pains for We must use our best En∣deavours doing what we can and  then we may expect God's gracious Assistance But when Men expect Re∣ligion should cost them no Pains and that Happiness should drop into their Laps without any Labour on their Part and that God should snatch them up into Heaven when they Die as he did the good Thief they will at last find themselves much mistaken in their Measures 'Tis troublesome at first I confess for a Man to begin a new Life but when he begins to habi∣tuate himself to a Religious and Vir∣tuous Life the Trouble will soon go off and unspeakable Pleasure succeed in its Place It was an excellent Rule which  Pythagoras  gave to his Schol∣lars  Optimum vitae genus eligito nam consuetudo faciet jucundissimum Re∣solve always to do what is most rea∣sonable and Custom will soon make it Easie  And those who upon Pretence of the Difficulties of Religion aban∣don themselves to a wicked Course of Life may easily be convinced tho' perhaps when 'tis too late that they took more Pains to make themselves Miserable than would have been to bring them to Happiness  The Difference betwixt an Atheist and an Enthusiast is this The Atheist thinks nothing Unlawful as believing no God to judge him An Enthusiast thinks every Thing that comes into his Head not only Lawful but the Inspi∣ration of God and as such is promp∣ted with a fiery Zeal to propagate it with the Hazard of his Life the over∣turning of Government and embroil∣ing the World And when a Man is once fully possess'd with this Spirit which works upon his Imagination his Reason is wholly clouded his Discourses are inconsistent he has nothing in his View but his present Impulse and as that alters he pursues the quite con∣trary with the same Vehemence not reflecting that it is opposite to his former Sentiments Now this is most certainly a great Excess of Pride which yet recommends it self to many well∣inclined and religiously disposed Peo∣ple under the Notion of Abstraction from the World of Humility and SelfDenial For what greater Exalta∣tion of ones self can be imagin'd and indeed Rebellion against God than to think my self exempted upon account of my own Holiness from those Insti∣tutions  which God has appointed and from that Authority which he has or∣dain'd amongst Men and by whose Hands he does dispence his Blessings to us What greater Delusion than to think that we can contrive a shorter and safer Way to Heaven than that which God hath commanded us Not to be contented with that Station wherein he hath placed us but to raise our selves above that Order by which he governs the World who as long as they administer Justice are to be revered as God's Vicegerents up∣on Earth to despise Dominion and speak Evil of Dignities which is a sign of Reprobation It is no less than assuming the Power of God to our selves to usurp his Throne and as far as in us lies to take the Govern∣ment of the World out of his Hands All this is the Effect of Enthusiasm All the Looseness and Wickedness of this Age is to have no Principles but guided wholly by our Humour and Fancy and most of the Heresies or Schisms which have divided the Church came from this Fountain  St  Augustin  tell us That the mighty Suc∣cess and strong Prosperity of the  Romans  was a Reward given them by God for their eminent Justice and other Virtues As to particular Persons the Providences of God are promiscuously given in this World so that we cannot certainly conclude God's Love or Hatred to any Person by any thing that befals him in this Life But God deals otherwise with Nations because Publick States and Communities as such can only be rewarded and punished in this World for in the next all Publick Societies will be dissolved and every Man shall give an Account of himself to God The great crying Sins of a Nation can∣not hope to escape Publick Judgments which God may defer for a Time to give People a longer space of Repentance but sooner or later they have Reason to expect his Vengeance God hath Lead∣en Feet but Iron Hands he is longere he punishes but strikes home at last and usually the longer Punishment is delay'd it is the heavier when it comes Experience in all Ages hath made this good We find through the History of the Old Testament the interchangeable Providences of God towards the Peo∣ple  of  Israel  always suited to their Manners They were constantly Pro∣sperous or Afflicted as Virtue and Piety flourished and declined amongst them And thus God deals with all others The  Roman  Empire whilst that People remained Virtuous was firm and strong as Iron but upon Dissolution of their Manners the Iron was soon mixed with miry Clay and the Feet upon which that Empire stood were soon broken  Of KINGS and PRINCES and the Education of a PRINCE  T  HERE are found admira∣ble Occurrences in the Lives of all Men but much more in Princes who moving in a higher Sphere their Acti∣ons are more conspicuous and worthy to be transmitted to Posterity as In∣structive to their Successors And tho' Prosperity is more agreeable to our Na∣ture yet Adversity is more Benefi∣cial when Princes make a right Im∣provement of it to shun those Rocks whereon some Princes have been split  It is very necessary to accustom a young Prince to divert himself amongst plea∣sant Men one cannot find a more sure and less painful Way to render him a most accomplisht Prince than having such Courtiers about him in his Youth but the Difficulty is to find such A Prince will not fail to learn insensibly  the Manners and Actions of those and whatsoever he gains that way becomes Natural to him Those that are near him should make use as much as is possible of that way to Instruct him it being absolutely necessary that those who have Wit and are wellbred Men should not only be receiv'd by the Prince but that Means be taken to find them out for commonly such Men are not overforward to shew themselves They know how to be Content with their own small Fortunes and besides such Men are so rarely met with that those who understand them need not fear to be troubled with too many of them for I do not remember in all my Time who have spent many Years in the World to have seen so few of them as at present  To make a Prince speak well it is necessary to mix a little Art and Study and a Prince ought to have something of both for to the compleating of a worthy honest Man there is nothing more necessary than wellSpeaking and wellDoing What Gracefulness so clear a Source gives to all our Actions How doth it beautifie our Words and Thoughts How amiable a Thing it is  to Speak well when Sincerity goes along with it  Young Princes are commonly more Active than Speculative and most ea∣sily carried away with the Pleasures of the World yet there are some who by Nature are serious enough and are capable to retire into themselves as King  Charles  the First and King  James  the Second It were to be wished that a young Prince be neither too Active nor too Serious the best Temper is to partake of both and be able to pass with Ease from the one to the other Some Attempts might be made to give a young Prince the Apprehension of certain Things with which Children are not to entertain themselves as surpassing their ordinary Capacity for tho' a Child understands not at first what is said to them yet it prepares him a∣gainst another time and they are as lit∣tle Essays of Reason which come not all at once It is necessary for him that would attain Virtues to begin gradually at the lowest Step to guard his Senses and set a watch upon the Avenues of his Passions for Man becomes neither perfectly Virtuous or Vitious all at once and  Jesus  the Son of  Syrach  hath said  He that contemns little Things shall fall by little and little  The smallest Occasion suffices to say something that pleases and it is of much Importance to form a Prince's Will agreeably for then he will take Pleasure to hearken to a Man that hath Judgment and Wit and will be desirous to be instructed by him And if Persons about a Prince have a Grace in their Words and Acti∣ons the Prince will retain the Manner how to behave and express himself This agreeable way of Talking is of great Consequence and the surest way to acquire it is to let such as have and practise it come into the Prince's Com∣pany Those Princes who are young and understand not all that's said to them want often that some Body put them in Mind and when Princes keep Com∣pany with such they take some Obser∣vations which they should never have of themselves and we our selves find if many Things had been discover'd to us in our Youth which we have since found by our own Experience and Re∣flections we had saved much Time and one Word to the Purpose then had made us comprehend a World of Things which we know not nor shall ever know whilst we live But we reflect not  on those Opportunities till we have lost them and we are not aware of them till it be too late All the World com∣mits Faults but the greatest are only perceived  Those who have the Education of young Princes should endeavour to make them Love or Hate that which deserves the one or the other that the Prince may have a good Taste or Discernment for this would make him understand what he should Learn and the Means to be excellent in it For if a Prince had be∣forehand a right Apprehension of Good and Evil the very Course of Things would instruct him and the Aversion to what is Evil whensoever he saw it would be sufficient to avoid it A young Prince cannot have too curious a Taste to discern betwixt true and false Plea∣sures and not to be deceiv'd in either The most agreeable way of instructing is to do that Well which we see others do Ill by which we make our Life more easie Besides those that are about a young Prince should endeavour that the Wit and Heart of the Prince should be disposed as they ought to be 'Tis true that Wit finds out the way to at∣tain Perfection but the Heart is neces∣sary to put in Practice what is judged  to be the  Best  and that which we call the having a good Taste or Discernment is oftenest found in a young Prince who is usually born with more than an ordinary Genius tho' a late Emi∣nent Philosopher holds That all Chil∣dren Naturally have near the same Ca∣pacity and that the chief Difference proceeds from the Care that is taken to inform Children But I think the first Advantage is rather to be ascribed to a happy Birth and that Art does af∣terwards perfect it and I have always believed we should not so much wish for any thing in a young Prince as Wit it being impossible not to have it if he be Educated in the Company of some People as to the learning by  ones  self it very seldom happens that the Mind without some extraordinary Help takes the right Course to do it 'Tis true indeed our late King  Charles  the Second was a very excellent and knowing Man and had a great Insight into Men and Manners tho' in his Youth by the Reason of our intestine Troubles and the Rebellion raised a∣gainst his Royal Father he was Taught very little yet he had an excellent Go∣vernor in his tender Years which was the Marquis of  Hartford  and after him  the Earl of  Newcastle  but when that Prince went Generalissimo into the  West  of  England  his Highness had the poor∣est and  weakest  Man for his Governor that I ever saw yet they who had In∣terest in the Prince and were near a∣bout him instructed him in so pleasant a Way that he was most agreeable in Conversation And when he came to the Throne if he had loved Business as well as he understood it he had been one of the greatest Princes of the last Age but he was wholly addicted to his Pleasures and ChamberPractice which much shortned his Days and yet he may be reckon'd amongst the most admir'd Princes of his Time who had form'd and instructed himself a∣mongst the bestbred Princes in  Eu∣rope  A young Prince should never be over burthen'd with a long Chain of Instru∣ctions his Tutor should rather chuse to speak few Things and let each Pre∣cept take its Effect and should give the Prince a Reason of all he tells him so that the Prince of his own Accord might insensibly make the Application to him∣self it being much better to enlighten his Understanding than to charge his Memory  And above all Things he should teach the Prince to be Free and Affable which Virtues make Princes to be belov'd and it is of great Consequence for a young Prince to have the Art of ma∣king himself be belov'd When Majesty and Civility are mix'd together it makes Men find with Pleasure that such Princes are their Masters The more Princes condescend the more ready are their Servants to submit especially if they be wellbred Persons who never presume too much The most Eminent Princes were wont to communicate freely and were very familiar  Caesar  was so with his own Soldiers which so charm'd them that when they fought for his Glory they found nothing difficult and were not apprehensive of Danger Heaven takes those Hearts into its Protection and in fighting Fifty Battels which  Cae∣sar  did without losing one he was always very Active and yet never re∣ceiv'd any Hurt Such Princes are al∣ways belov'd and tho' Fortune which is ever inconstant leaves their Side yet Glory and Honour never forsake them  Caesar  was of this Number He had nothing in him which savour'd not of Grandeur he was brave and full of  Civility he would hazard his own Per∣son to save the meanest of his Soldiers He lov'd all those that loved his Fortune he shar'd with them the Glory as he did the Danger he understood well how to make himself be Belov'd  Ʋt Ameris Ama  which is a sure way if it be perform'd handsomely the principal Secret consists in managing it so that the Persons whom one loves should be glad of it  There is nothing so much to be fear'd in a young Prince as giving him an ill Master for the best Natural Parts would be but of little use if Care be not taken to improve them One can never take any thing right without having learnt it and who can believe that either to do a Thing well or to do it better if one doth it well that Study can ever hinder it We see in all Exercises how much good Masters are necessary and it were very strange that the Body should be capable of Instruction and not the Mind for what likelyhood is there that Practice and good Masters are effectual to make a young Man skillful in riding the Great Horse and that to the making of an accomplish'd Person they should both be needless  The Body and the Mind are sel∣dom as one would wish but the De∣fects of the Body seem more difficult to be corrected for the Mind is na∣turally supple and may be redress'd if a right Course be taken and the Rea∣son why it falls out otherwise is when we learn to do a Thing of an ill Master one learns to do it ill and it is much more difficult to chuse good Masters for framing the Mind than for the Body for the Advantages of the Bo∣dy are much more remarkable than those of the Mind To be able and well∣bred to such a Degree as one would have a great Prince one cannot know too many Things if we have Skill to make a right Use of them and know how to Value them but to have read much or to have learnt a Number of different Opinions discovers nothing of Certainty for we know nothing well but what we see clearly and that which we can make others see presently and understand if they be clearsighted and we should mistrust all which we see as through a Cloud and which we cannot make plain to the Sight of another There are some Princes who would have been very gallant Men if Care had been taken at first to put them in a right way  and to have shew'd them what was to be done For a great Prince upon whom the Happiness of the Publick de∣pends by whose Example his People will fashion themselves as being the most noble Model no Care in the World should be neglected The Business is to make a young Prince Happy and that all who live under him may be so it being reasonable that those should a little share in the Happiness who are in Duty ob∣liged to Sacrifice themselves for prosecu∣ting of it and therefore this first Point of their Education is of much greater Im∣portance to them than to private Per∣sons For when Princes are no longer under the Conduct of Governors all that they do or say is approv'd or at least it is so in Appearance For no Person comes into their Presence but with a design to please them because altho' he loves them yet one easily inclines to love their Favour more and it were a great Imprudence for any Man to draw the Hatred of his Prince upon himself and to advise him as he would one of his particular Friends unless at first the Prince had signified his Pleasure to have it so However those Persons that are near about Princes that be young if they are not too much sway'd by Inte∣rest  may very securely tell them in an agreeable manner all which may con∣tribute to their Glory and Happiness 'Tis certain a very easie Thing to give them good Advice as to their Glory but it is not so to their Happiness which depends more upon the Tem∣per and whosoever will ascertain a Prince what will make him happy must know him perfectly well for most com∣monly we our selves know not what would be best for our own Happiness But when all is done it seems to me that with a very little Help it were no difficult Thing for a young Prince to be happy  Certainly that young Prince is in a fair way to it who sees himself one of the first amongst the Masters of the World and that Fortune hath nothing greater to give And therefore Princes should consider what Pleasure it is to do good that there is nothing more Noble and that this Delight was made only for Princes For the more Fa∣vours they bestow the more they are in Condition to grant provided their Gifts be with Choice and Esteem which supports their Grandeur and renders them more Powerful It is not Riches that are principally desir'd from Kings but  Employments and Trusts and that which makes Men desire high Com∣mands is not for Conveniency of Life for their Lives are by them made more troublesome but it is Hopes of making it appear that they have Merit in them and are useful to the Publick and when just Persons that have Worth and Fide∣lity are put into Employments they make themselves soon known and their Princes are well serv'd We have lately seen in  England  a sad Example of ta∣king false Measures herein the ill Choice of our late King's Ministers was his Ruin Besides what greater Slavery can there be than that Princes are chain'd to their Posts and cannot make themselves  less  all their Words and Actions are descant∣ed upon and made publick Discourse A Prince cannot with Dignity quit his Guards Fortune hath him in Custody a Train besets him whereever he goes and there is no making an Escape but still he that is the Master of many is the Servant of more  The great and honourable Fame of a King in this World depends more upon his wise Administration than upon his private Morals the Goodness of his Government depends chiefly upon those that advise him and execute under him it being an infallible Maxim  That he  is the worst at least the most unhappy King who hath the worst Councellors and Ministers under him  Princes should endeavour to couple Warlike and peaceable Virtues together to know at all times how to Rule their own State and protect their Subjects to honour the Good and chastise the Wicked to change the Pleasures of the Body into those of the Mind to seek their Content in the Acquisition of those Things which may raise them above o∣ther Persons But this Perfection is not easily met with at Court where every Thing stands in Opposition to good De∣signs Princes are born to govern and therefore they must govern well with∣out amusing themselves with Knowledge more curious than useful which would better become a Professor of Philoso∣phy than a Prince  There is no doubt but Sciences do adorn the Titles of Princes as Diadems do their Heads and Jewels their Crowns but the most necessary Philosophy for a Prince is to know how to do Justice to his People and to defend them from their Enemies and to understand what Persons are able to serve him well ne∣vertheless many Princes enter upon the Government before they have pass'd an  Apprentiship for it and take least Care of what concerns them most  Foreign Languages are most neces∣sary for a Prince and serve for a great Ornament to him the Princes Electors of  Germany  would admit no Man here∣tofore to the Imperial Dignity unless he was able to speak  Latin Italian Sclavonian  and  Dutch  and the Empe∣ror  Frederick  the Second could besides speak elegant  French Spanish  and  Tur∣kish  which was very rare in his time He was also skilful in the ancient vulgar  Greek  and indeed the Intercourse of Princes who live upon the Continent permits them not to neglect these Lan∣guages without running a great Incon∣veniency The  English  Genius for clear speaking and writing is always to the Point they look upon rambling Dis∣couses with Contempt and as Men of Reason they stand more upon Strength of Argument than all the Pomp of Rhe∣torick not so much concern'd to move the Hearer's Affections as to warm his Reason Perhaps no Nation is more Satyrical and quicker in Repar∣tees which argues Wit to express them∣selves significantly we have a most hap∣py Language compounded chiefly of  Saxon Latin  and  French  of which  Saxon  is the Stock the other two being ingrafted into it The  English  is so significant that it does almost equalize the  Greek  and does even exceed the  Latin  in a particular Grace of com∣pounding Words which is as great a Beauty as can be in Language In Point of Sweetness the  French  and the  Ita∣lian  run smoother but they want Sinews especially the last The  Spanish  is Ma∣jestical but boisterous the High  Dutch  Manly but very harsh whereas the  En∣glish  is both sweet and manly If we look upon the famous Men of our Nation which have been Learned or Soldiers we shall find many very famous as Venerable  Bede  Sir  Thomas Moor  Lord  Bacon Smith Spelman Camden Selden Daniel Drayton Ben Johnson Shake∣spear Beaumont Fletcher  Sir  Philip Sidney Cowley Oldham Dryden  and ma∣ny others But is impossible to learn Lan∣guages without travelling which em∣bellishes the Minds of those that use it prudently A young Prince that travels will understand Nations imitate what they have of good and avoid the rest he should heedfully regard the Laws and Fundamental Maxims of State the Inclinations of Sovereigns their Reve∣nues the Order of their Courts their  Alliances their Power and their Fa∣vourites that Prince who hath seen  Europe  with Judgement knows every thing that can carry him to glorious Acti∣ons and certainly a young Prince that travils profits more in two Years than if he had stay'd in his Study ten Years Travel teaches them to understand the Plenty of Countries the Force of Ri∣vers and which are the most eminent Places of Traffick and Commerce the Convenience of Bridges the distance of Places the Strength and Situation of Cities and Castles the Number of the People the Inclination of the Subjects the Humour of Princes the Sympathy and Antipathy of Nations and many other things which may instruct a General of an Army to fortifie Places to entrench to Camp an Army advan∣tagiously to draw up a Body of Men in Battle to lead an Army to fight and to shew themselves eminent Examples to their Followers Travel also gives a Prince Lessons of Temperance Mode∣sty and Patience and the Languages which are useful to all Men are most ne∣cessary to Princes and to those who would have any Command of Armies  Spanish  is the noblest of all Bastard Lan∣guages it not being a MotherTongue  but compounded of  Latin Gothick A∣rabick  and  Spanish  The  Romans Goths  and  Moors  having reign'd some Ages in that Country did introduce a Mix∣ture of all those Languages A Prince should also learn the Mathematicks which will teach him to besiege and fortifie Places These are the most needful Studies for a Prince and not to spend his time upon Logical Noti∣ons but to chuse such Studies as are proportionable to his Condition It is sufficient that a Prince be ready in sa∣cred and prophane History that he take a Delight in some Books and sometimes consult the dead who will say that which none of the living dare say to him he should read such Books as may teach him to know the Condi∣tion of his Friends and Enemies he should learn Principles of Generosity and Honour distinctly to know those that love the Publick Good and Inte∣rest and to favour them with such Of∣fices as they deserve and to punish them that do otherwise And tho' it be honourable for Kings to aggrandize their best Deserving Subjects yet a Prince ought not to diffuse his Graces too pro∣digally least the Servant should become the Master which in all Courts and at  all times hath proved very prejudicial The Planets would have little Regard to the Sun if they had no need of his Light nor a Servant of his Master if he could do him no good Princes ought therefore to be circumspect in Distribution of their Favours if they would not lose that Honour and Re∣spect which their Subjects give them A King gives an Account of his Acti∣ons to none but God he ought ne∣vertheless to act equitably and not to plunge brave Men into Despair than which nothing is more dangerous who having lost their Estates by their most faithful and long Services thinking they have nothing more to lose are capable to make the greatest report of their Wrongs 'tis true Kings may take the Benefits bestowed when they that received them become unworthy of them but before a King comes to that Extremi∣ty he should endeavour to reduce them to their Duty and having tried all fair Ways the Prince must be careful not faintly to execute his Resolution nor rashly to enter upon a great Action which in Prudence he must afterwards abandon A Prince should think seri∣ously of a Thing before he enters up∣on it but having begun he should car∣ry  it through for there is nothing more repugnant to Authority of Kings than to act by halfs nor any thing that en∣courages Subjects so much to Rebelli∣on as to see their Masters are afraid of them A Prince ought to spend some Time in reading especially History which will render him able and know∣ing and it is a good Guide and what concerns Life which it does antidate and makes the Reader contemporary with the Times past and by running up beyond his Nativity the Prince will be something the wiser for it and will have a Stock of Sense without much Trouble of his own and it is of great Use to perswade by Example that which we have a Mind to History is a kind of Experience and we may reap much by it besides there are some Histories written by so good Hands which tho' we know yet it is a Pleasure to read them as  Thucidides Polibius Caesar  's  Commentaries  with the Duke of  Ro∣han  and Sir  Clement Edmond  's Observa∣tions upon them and  Hugo Grotius de Jure Pacis Belli  and  Selden  's  Mare clausum  but to read over much and to be constantly poring upon Books brings neither Pleasure nor Profit Read∣ing too much overcharges Nature it  is Thought and Digestion that makes Reading profitable which being well managed gives a great Insight into all Things He that depends upon his own Experience hath but a few Mate∣rials to work upon and to take Mea∣sures wholly from Books without look∣ing into Men and Business is like tra∣velling in a Map where only Countries and Cities are well distinguish'd but Villages and private Houses are seldom or never marked  Young Princes after some Hours in their Study should bestow some others upon Sports because the Mind being taken up too long with Contemplation will disrelish Study if it be not refresh∣ed with some Recreations in which Hunting is one of the most agreeable to Princes and because Youth runs easi∣ly down the Hill towards Pleasures therefore Princes should sometimes play at Tennis tho' most commonly young Princes would rather endure the Pains of Hunting a whole Day than study∣ing but two Hours which they think a Labour which is really nothing but pure Delight and Studying would be a sensual Pleasure if the Mind were capable of any in those younger Years For those that have once tasted it can  never take themselves off again in such Manner that they become despicable and good for nothing else As for Ex∣ercises Hunting has always been the Recreation of Princes nor never dise∣steemed but by those that know not the Benefit of it It withdraws the great Men about the Prince from Idle∣ness which is the Mother of all Vi∣ces or from Gaming which is unsuit∣able to their Condition It makes Prin∣ces strong active and bold Almost all Princes love Hunting and apply them∣selves to it because it is a Representa∣tion of War a good Huntsman is or may easily be a good Soldier To sur∣prize the Wolf or the Fox a Man must use a certain Subtilty which teaches us to lay Ambushes for the Enemy To take a wild Boar one must know how to present the Boar Spear to Ad∣vantage just as one would do a Pike or a Halbert when two Bodies of Sol∣diers come to push of Pike To shoot a Deer or Hare running a Patridge or a Quale flying one must be as good a Marksman as the best Fusileer in the Army besides Hunting enures a Prince to endure Hunger Thirst Heat Cold Rain Snow and all the Incommodities of  the Air without which it is impossible to be a good Soldier  I confess Princes should endeavour to couple Moral and Martial Virtues to∣gether I know Liberality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince it being much better for him to be Profuse than Covetuous Prodigality having a resem∣blance of something more noble than Avarice and really it is less odious Nay those that gain by it make it pass for a Virtue but perhaps it is more pre∣judicial to Posterity and more dange∣rous than the other Extream For tho' a King should give away his whole King∣dom he would not satisfie all that ask No nor all that think they deserve much of him It is then more convenient to give with Reason and never to draw so near the Bottom but that the Prince may always have wherewith to gratifie Persons of Merit and above all the Prince should take special Care that his Liberalities be exercised without op∣pressing his People to avoid Murmu∣ring which is the ready way to pro∣duce Rebellion But there is little need at this Time of making Laws against giving too much Princes are not too free in this Age and there are not many that want an Overseer in  this kind especially in our  English  Court It is certain that Kings by the Eminency of their Places are highly obliged to Integrity because the least Blemish in them grows up to a monstrous Deformity They are the  Primum Mobile  upon which all other Orbs depend and  Assiadorus  says it were more credible that Nature should Err than for a Prince to frame a Commonwealth different from the Constitution of his own Life he being a Glass issuing forth Incentives to Imitation and where that is wanting the Government cannot long subsist Was not  Rome  Warlike under  Romulus  Religious under  Numa  Con∣tinent under  Fabricius  Dissolute under  Lucullus  and  Antony  Idolatrous under  Julian  Immerged in  Arianism  under  Valens  To shew that People are always moulded into the Temper of their Prince and where that is not the Government is short And we find in Holy Writ Judgment threatned to Princes who have been a Snare instead of a Sanctua∣ry to their Subjects And St  Augustin  calls them the worst of Homicides in destroying the Souls of their Subjects and therefore that King who under∣stands his Duty to God cannot be ig∣norant how many Obligations of Vir∣tue  are annexed to a Crown since the Lives of his Subjects are shaded under his Protection and since a King medi∣ates between God and his People it is as necessary that he should adhere first to God as he would have his People be faithful to him so that he must in the first Place consecrate himself next his Kingdom to the Service of his Creator and whoever does not this he overturns both Divine and Humane Laws Kings are not to be esteemed Happy for their Conquests but by using their Power in the Advancement of God's Honour and Service The Royal Dignity is not sufficiently great of it self to render him Happy that injoys it by the sole considering what he is for if a King be left alone without any Com∣pany to think of himself at Leisure he will find himself to be a Man full of Miseries and that feels them as well as other common Persons and therefore carefully to avoid this there never fail to be near the Persons of Kings a great many that continually watch to make Divertisements for Princes and supply their leisure Time with Pleasures and Pastimes that none of their Time may be vacant which is to say that Kings are encompassed round with Persons that  are very careful Kings should not be alone to think of themselves knowing very well that a King as he is he would be very Miserable if he should be left alone and indeed the chief thing that supports Men in great Employments is that they are perpetually hindred from Thinking of themselves for it is the Noise and Bustle that divert us and is most grateful Men have a secret Instinct that intices them to seek Divertisements which proceeds from the continual Sense of their Misery and they feel another secret Instinct that remains from the Greatness of their first Nature which makes them know that their Happiness consists only in Rest and these two con∣trary Instincts flatter them that the Sa∣tisfaction they expect will come by open∣ing the Door that will admit them to Rest which is usually sought by strug∣gling with some Opposition in vain And therefore  Cyneas  the Philosopher said well to  Pyrrhus  who promised he would enjoy his Pleasures with his Friends when he had conquered a good Part of the World But  Cyneas  told him he would do better to advance his own Happiness by injoying that Rest present∣ly than to seek it by so many Troubles but  Pyrrhus  could not be Happy either  before or after Conquering a great Part of the World and the sensual Life his Ministers advised him to was less able to content him than the Agitation of so great Wars and so many Voyages as he designed  'Tis certain Man hunts after Felici∣ty in all his Actions for all Men desire to be Happy and what ever different Means they use all tends to this End it is the same Desire in both that in∣clines one to go the War and the other not to go the Will doth never move one Step but with regard to this Object of Felicity It is the true and real Mo∣tive of all Men's Actions nay even of those that Hang themselves When Peo∣ple believe their Prince is Liberal Va∣liant and Prudent they will more rea∣dily obey his Will and receive his Com∣mands with Respect but to gain the Reputation of being a Prudent Prince he should be very careful that his Mini∣sters and Servants be Friends to the Publick Good that they be Affable Modest and Generous The Prince must shew a constant Resolution to maintain his People in their ancient Splendour That Adversity cast him not down nor Prosperity make him Insolent and to give a fairer Lustre to his Liberality  he should take Care that what he bestows do not arise out of the Oppression of any and being such without drawing his Sword or giving much to his Sub∣jects his Friends and Enemies too will esteem him Valiant Liberal and Pru∣dent and all of them fearing to offend him will pay him the Duties of Sub∣jects Friends and Neighbours and he need not doubt but God will dissipate his Enemies and all the mutinous ma∣licious Designs of his malicious Subjects and ambitious Neighbours  We must know that Kings are consi∣dered in a double Capacity that of Na∣ture and that of Policy the Politick Body never dies and is never defective of Authority or Direction the Acts of the Body Politick are not abated by the Natural Body's Access The Body Po∣litick is not disabled to govern by the Nonage of the Natural by the  lib Assis Placit  Justice  Thorp  's Judg∣ment was That the Gift of the King is not defeated by his Nonage And in the  Assis  Title  Droit Placit  in the Sixth Year of King  Edward  the Third a Writ of Right was brought by the King of a Manor as Heir to King  Ri∣chard  the Second the Exceptions of Nonage against the King was not ad∣mitted  for tho' the Natural Body dies the Politick never dies So in the th of Queen  Elizabeth  the Leases of the Dutchy of  Lancaster  made by  Edward  the Sixth were resolved by all the Judges to be good tho' made in the King's Minority and the Change of Religion made by  Edward  the Sixth in his Mino∣rity was good tho' he had not Age to discern what he did being then in the Hands of his Uncle the Protector and if Catholicks should pretend to make void the Change of Religion made in that King's Time because of his Mino∣rity they would be laughed at by all the World and their Pretence would be ridiculous  Of MAN  T  HE Transactions of this World are the most unplea∣sant Speculations that ever entertained my Mind the whole Offspring of Nature moveth as at first but only Man who was design'd Master of the whole runs a Course contrary to all Order and the whole Progeny of  Adam  is obnoxious to his Original Guilt We have innate Affections and Propensities to do Evil since our first Mother's Converse with the Serpent and the sad Effects of  A∣dam  's Fate are derived to all but yet no Evil is in us but the Cure is in our own Power no poisonous Herb sprouts out but in the same Field its Antidote is placed It is therefore a Wonder that Men who know they have rational Souls should only follow the Dictates of Sense and for one Hour of Pleasure here suf∣fer an Eternity of Torments hereafter for by embracing our Heady Appetites we have chang'd the whole Mass of our Nature and have set our selves a diame∣trical  Opposition to all that is called good so that all our Actions are impertinent and we level our Designs at a false End and we wander in those Paths which will lead us to the Gates of Destruction  The Enjoyment of what the World affords is that we only seek after The Devil began with these in his first Temp∣tation of  Eve  in Paradise and it seems he had not four thousand Years after found out three better Engines for his Turn than these for he used the very same in the Wilderness to our Saviour  the promised Seed of the Woman  that he had prevail'd with on  Eve  her self in Paradise so long before  Make these Stones bread  there's the Lust of the Flesh  He shews him all the Kingdoms of the World  there's the Lust of the Eyes  Cast thy self down from the Pin∣nacle the Angels are thy Guard to bear thee up in their Hands  there's the Pride of Life 'Tis true the Devil can do no more but tempt us his Power how∣ever great is limited tho' we cannot easily set out the Bounds of it he has his Chains of Restraint as well as Tor∣ment It seems an Invasion of God's Prerogative and a giving the Devil more than his Due to allow him a Power of immediate and impressive  Injection into our Minds without the Help of our own innate Corruptions for 'tis by these we hold the Candle to him and the Wedge too of the Temp∣tation whilst he drives it the Mud is still in the Bottom he does but stir it up by shaking it or drawing it forth by some outward Objects There is no easier Way to outreach a Man than to outend him If once the Devil can get a Man to shoot with him in his own Bow and make his Engines a Man's End the Match is lost as we use to say in the very making  Now if any Man will but seriously try he shall find it more possible to withhold his Affection from the Things of this World than enjoy the Satisfacti∣on of his Taste in it  Socrates  had more true Joy in safely looking on all the O∣lympick Games and thanking the Gods that they had made him not to need the many things they had made for o∣thers Pursuits than  Alcibiades  in his ha∣zardous obtaining them which made  Socrates  cry out  Quos diderunt dii qui∣bus non indigeo  'Tis worth our Obser∣vation to consider the Toil that such Men take who are in love with the Pleasures of this World to eternize if possible their earthly Happiness by a  Succession of Variety and to take off the Weariness of one Pleasure by a∣nother between the Oil and the Wine as  Seneca  speaks  Homines inter vinum oleum occupati  but all in vain for after those few evaporated Minutes of Pleasure the Body quietly fails the Mind and the Mind the Desire and the Desire the Satisfaction and all the Man There is indeed nothing more in all these Pleasures besides bare Imagination and Expectation which tho' they may draw out the Affections do never sa∣tisfie them nay do the more dissatis∣fie and disappoint them and Pleasure is but an Earnest laid down for Grief if not for Ruin  This Adventure hath no other Re∣turn and if this be a Man's End 'tis an End that quickly ends both it self and him Many have come to their End by it never any enjoy'd their End in it  Alexander  was a greater Conque∣ror in overcoming his own Desire of seeing  Darius  his Wife and Daughters than in subduing them  Victor Magis Darii uxorem non videndo quam Da∣rium vincendo  In the next Place we shall see some Men rake Riches together as Children  do Snow rowling it up with no little Pains and Hazards of their Health in∣to Heaps and then fashioning them in∣to Horses Giants and Castles and the next Shower washes them away and leaves nothing in the Place but Dirt It was well said of  Themistocles  that great General to a common Soldier  Thou who art not  Themistocles  take this Trash to thee  meaning the Jewels and the rich  Persian  Spoils after a Victory Wealth certainly is one of the greatest Bankrupts in the World and does not satisfie the Debt it promises for a Man may as soon fill a Quart Pot with Vir∣tue as a rational Mind with Wealth there must be a Proportion between the Ingredient and the Capacity We call that Well or Brain empty that hath not Water or Wit tho' the first be full of Air the other of Vapour they are still empty of what should fill them and so will the Heart of Man be tho' never so full of Wealth and much of it doth but let us see how much more of it we want The World is not so unequally dealt as we talk the Rich want a Stomach oftner than the Poor do Meat If the Poor Man's Hunger and Labour be more his Meat and Sleep are sweeter and what Hap∣pinesses  are these that are as well not received as enjoyed as well wanted as had the Will would certainly never be satisfy'd if it had all it desired but one is presently satisfy'd if he renounces it in complying with the Will we shall never be at quiet not complying with it we shall always be at rest  Solo∣mon  and  Job  have best known the Happiness and Misery of Man and have the best described it one of them the happiest and the other the most wretched of Men the one knew the Vanity of all Pleasure the other the Reality of all Evils by Experience  Pleasure instead of satisfying doth satiate but Riches doth neither For my own Part my Humour does not much depend upon these Things I have always fair and soul Weather with∣in my self good or ill Success in my Affairs does not much move me I sometimes set my self against ill For∣tune and the Glory of overcoming it makes me master it with Pleasure whereas at other Times I am very in∣different and as it were dissatisfy'd e∣ven with Prosperity looking upon Worldly Glory but as a Fancy If we fish for it we shall find it nothing an Apparition like the Night Mare in a  Dream you imagine it a Substance you grasp at it you awake and it is nothing Pleasure yet and Wealth will abide a Sense or two but this of Glory can neither be felt seen or understood be∣sides the Slipperiness of it should make us undervalue it Let us remember the Consul  Bibulus  in his triumphant Chariot by the Fall of a TileStone from a House made a Sacrifice before he could reach the Capitol to offer up the Bulls and Garlands he had prepared or in that prodigious Favourite  Sejanus  whom the same Day saw attended by the Se∣nate and torn in Pieces by the People nay we need not go so far back we need but think of the  De Wits  in  Holland  who govern'd absolutely that Common Wealth and were so torn in Pieces by the People in the Morning that there scarce remained ere Night so much as a Mammeck of Flesh It hath rai∣sed some but it hath ruin'd more and those whom it hath most raised it hath much ruin'd  Paucos beavit sed plures perdidit quos heavit perdidit  Certainly if there be any thing glorious in this World 'tis a Mind that contemns that Glory  Diogenes  had more of it by his Contempt than  Alexander  by his Com∣mand of it when he commanded him∣self to be made a God  Of GREATNESS of MIND  W  HEN  Leonidas  was to car∣ry his Men into the Streights of the  Thermo∣pyle  to put a Stop to  Xer∣xes  's huge Army  Come FellowSoldiers  says he  eat your Din∣ner here as if you were to sup in another World  and they answered his Resolu∣tion How plain was that Speech of  Cedilius  to his Men upon a desperate Action  Soldiers  says he  'tis necessa∣ry for us to go but not for us to return  This brief and pertinent Harangue had in it a glorious Mixture both of Bra∣very and Prudence  The Action of  Caesar  upon taking  Pompey  's Cabinet at the Battle of  Phar∣salia  was Noble It's probable that the Letters in it might have discover'd who were his Friends and who his Enemies and yet he burnt it without so much as opening it esteeming it the noblest Way of pardoning to keep himself ig∣norant  both of the Offender and of the Offence  It was also a brave Presence of Mind in  Alexander  who upon Advice in a Letter that his Physician  Philip  in∣tended to poison him took the Let∣ter of Advice in one Hand and the Cup in the other delivering  Philip  the Letter to read whilst he drank up the Poison Resolution is the inexpugnable Defence of humane Weakness and is u∣sually attended with wonderful Provi∣dence  Horatius Cocles  offer'd his single Body to the whole Army of his Enemies 'till the Bridge was broken down behind him and then leapt into the River with his Sword in his Hand and came off safe to his Party  When  Epicurus  was ready to expire with an extream Torment of the Stone  This  says he  is the last and blessed Day of my Life  It is never said of the  Fabii  that they were overcome but that they were slain nor of  Regulus  that he was vanquish'd by the  Carthaginians  but that he was taken and yet there is a great Difference in the same Acti∣on done by a brave Person and by a Stupid as the Death of  Cato  was e∣steemed  honourable but that of  Brutus  shameful  How wise and happy was  Saladine  the great Conqueror of  Asia  who triumph'd over himself and in his victorious Return caused a Shirt to be carry'd before him on the Point of a Spear with this Proclamation that after all his Glories he should carry nothing to the Grave but that poor Shirt So  Adrianus  a  Roman  Em∣peror to qualifie the excessive Joys of his high Fortune celebrated his own Funeral and caused his Coffin to be carry'd before him when he went a publick Calvacade through  Rome  which was a sacred Triumph and a Heroick Insult over himself and Death  When  Regulus  was unhappily taken Prisoner at the Siege of a Battle with the  Carthaginians  they sent him back to the Senate of  Rome  to propose a Peace and the Exchange of Prisoners but he was of a contrary Sentiment and disswaded the Senate from harkening to his Proposal chusing rather bravely to return to his Captivity there to be cru∣cify'd than to be instrumental to the least Dishonour or Disadvantage to his Country  Of CHILDREN  T  HE Making or Marring is in the first Age of  Children  for then their Minds by their Parent's Skill no less than their Bodies by the Midwife's Hand may with Ease be moulded into such a Fashion as will be durable in AfterAges The Seeds of Virtue should be so early Ingrafted into them that they should not know whe∣ther Nature or Precepts were the Teach∣ers of them Many Parents do endea∣vour unseasonably to sow Wisdom in them which does but corrupt their Na∣tures not yet ripe for such Instructions they should rather let them enjoy that Freedom which Nature in Pity hath be∣stow'd on them and not force them to endure the Punishment of human Cares before they have deserv'd them let harmless Wantonness be freely allow'd  them and let them rather fear than feel the Correction of their Parents To Colts and young Cattle we freely allow an uncontrolled Freedom least their first Strength which is then grow∣ing should be hindred and yet we are so blind in what we behold in other Creatures we either neglect or will not understand in our own Children who after they have fulfill'd the Folly of their first Years Age does by little and little change their Desires and the Roots of Virtue will spring up in them and therefore such as will call the raw Minds of Children to too hasty a Ripe∣ness of Studies are very Ignorant of the Strength which Nature bestow'd on that Age Some Children indeed have early Wits as  Papyrius  's Childhood that was judged worthy of the  Roman  Senate The Humours of Children are very va∣rious some seem to be made of a bet∣ter Mould than others There are often seen Presages of future Abilities in Chil∣dren as in  Cyrus  who first founded the  Persian  Monarchy who was bred up and believed to be a Shepherd's Child till after a more strict Inquiry he was found to be the Grandchild of  Astyages  and  Cato  in his Infancy was more than a Child but this is very uncertain and  they are often deceiv'd who by the Be∣haviour of Children will judge too ha∣stily of their future Disposition for it must be some great sign and firmly con∣stant above the Levity of that Age which must be brought as an effectual Argu∣ment to judge of the Inclination of their future and flexible Years Tho' some Children are more governable and ea∣sier gain'd by gentle Usage yet their Manners are generally according to their Education the neglect of Discipline and the force of Example makes the Difference and causes Children to suc∣ceed or miscarry but those who are naturally most inclin'd to Ill are in most Danger and since Education is the chief Reason of their first Principles great Care must be taken to set the Byass right at first and that Virtue may be early in∣still'd into their Minds which will make their Lives happy for the future and then Custom will make it easie to them And indeed Children should be treated with great Wariness they should hear and see nothing that should be dangerous in the Imitation and the Indiscretion of Parents is very often of ill Consequence in this Particular which puts me in mind of what  Montaign  says to this Purpose who being present whilst the Governante  was hearing his Daughter read and there being an obscene Word she for∣bad her the naming it whereupon the Father was very angry with the Gover∣nante and said  She had done his Daugh∣ter much hurt in taking Notice of that Word which she should have let pass without any Observation  Childhood is certainly the principal Time for Improvement whilst the Mind is at liberty the Memory strong Plea∣sures unknown to them and they are like white Paper where you may Write what you please and we should never design Children to any Profession before their Capacities are known and their Genius and Inclinations examin'd for otherwise their Nature may be crossed and to strive against the Stream is alto∣gether in vain and if Care were taken that the Inclinations of young Peo∣ple were suited to their Professions we should see them improve much faster than they do for Men must not endea∣vour to fly without Wings and to un∣dertake Business that is too hard for them The Passions of young Men often carry them with full Speed when they want the Bridle and not the Spur and like a Ship without a Pilot they often overset themselves being launched with∣out  Ballast and wanting a Compass to Steer by they are soon under Water And indeed Youth without good Breed∣ing is in a dangerous Condition and soon lost being subject to great Rash∣ness and therefore those that are Young should be very careful of their Carriage since we see oftentimes those that are very promising in their Youth flag at the last and fall short of Expectation  Young Men at their first Entrance into Man's Estate the Heat of Blood breeds in them a wonderful Change carries away their Mind with a Tide of inconsiderate Confidence and vain Se∣curity they know not how to be Pro∣vident for Aftertimes neither can they consider how obnoxious they are to the Ruins of Fortune  The Office of Childhood is to Learn and retain by a strong Memory the Deeds and Speeches of their Ancestors of Youth to invent and speak Things altogether new of middle Age to mo∣derate it self by Observation from both the former for then our Bodies and Minds are exceedingly changed from what they were heretofore and as we grow in Years our Pleasures and Incli∣nations are not the same even our Man∣ners and all our Desires are much dif∣ferent  and moulded as it were anew No Age of Man is more cunning than the middle Age in dissembling Friend∣ship and governing their Affections It can then wonder at it self that it could so improvidently go astray and endea∣vours to repair the Ruins of his younger Years and renews with much Vigour the Errors of the same Memory is e∣ver greatest in Children being then able to retain what they learn and still safely store it up in the Closets of their Memory but as Age increases it will decay and therefore their Minds ought to be fill'd with profitable History whilst they are young for Memory is like the Dew which in hot Countries falls up∣on the Leaves of Holly unless it be ga∣ther'd by break of Day it vanishes at Sun Rising Things of little Labour and no Judgement will easily be at∣tain'd by Children who are neither strong for Labour nor ripe for Judg∣ment  Publick Ministers when they have a Mind to prolong their Families in Ho∣nour should always breed at least one of their Children in their Office under them This the  French  do constantly practise which is disused in  England  to the great Prejudice of the Crown  where those great Places are most com∣monly sold and commonly ignorant Men put into those great Employments if they have but Mony enough believ∣ing great Places make great Men which it always does as to their Estates but very seldom as to their interior Qualifi∣cations which made King  James  the First say  That he had a Secretary that could not write and an ArchBishop who could not preach  The  Chineses  have that wholesome Piece of Policy that the Son is always of the Father's Trade and it is all the Learning he aims at which makes them admirable Artisans for besides the Dex∣trousness and Propensity of the Child being lineally descended from so many of the same Trade the Father's more careful to instruct him and to discover to him all the Mystery of it and this general Custom or Law keeps their Heads from running at random after Book Learning and other Vocations The extravagant Custom of  England  herein is not to be commended where all Men aspire to Book Learning when there is not a simpler Animal and a more superfluous Member of a State than meer Scholar  telluris inutile pondus  The  Goths  forbore to destroy the Li∣braries  of the  Greeks  and  Italians  be∣cause Books shou'd still keep them soft and simple to warlike Affairs It is re∣ported that  Grosthead  Bishop of  Lin∣coln  had a Brother a Husbandman who seeing his Brother come to that great Station came to him in Expecta∣tion of some great Preferment or some∣thing very considerable but the Bishop told him that if he wanted Mony to mend his Plow or Cart or to buy a new one of if he wanted Tackling for his Horses or any other Things belonging to his Husbandry he shou'd not want what was fitting but he wished him to aim no higher for Husbandman he found him and a Husbandman he would leave him and to shew the Force of Educa∣tion and that the learnedst Men are not always the wisest there goes a fa∣mous Story of  Thomas Aquinas  and Saint  Bonaventure  being both invited to Dinner by the  French  King on pur∣pose to observe their Humours being brought into the Room where the Ta∣ble was cover'd and made ready the first fell to eating of Bread as fast as he could and at last breaking out of a brown Stu∣dy he cry'd out  Concafum est contra Manichaeos  The other fell gazing up∣on the Queen and the King asking  him how he lik'd her  Oh Sir  says he  if an earthly Queen be so beautiful what shall we think of the Queen of Heaven  This latter was esteem'd the better Courtier But from hence we may infer That the learnedst Men are not always the civillest and best moral Men And there is too great a Number of them who lead a soft sedentary Life feeding only their own Fancies upon the Publick and therefore it were to be wished that the  English  had not so ge∣neral an itching after Book Learning  I well remember to have known a Person of Honour and great Quality in  England  to have had three Sons by the same Lady but of the most different Genius's and Contrariety of Humours that have been ever seen the eldest the most fantastical proudest and foolishest in all his Actions the Second the most learned sober and yet bigotted in De∣votion the Third the most dissolute and drunken that could be seen but yet very witty in Conversation inso∣much that there could not be found a more pregnant Instance to prove that humane Souls come not  extraduce  and by seminal Production from their Parents  Of LAW  I  T is the Effect of Law  Quod Homo Homini Deus non Lupus  That we do Protect and not Devour each other and therefore  Aristotle  well observes  Quod optimum animal Homo lege fruens sed pessimum animal Homo lege devians  Man is the best Creature with the Law but the worst without it The End and Aim for which Men enter into Society is not barely to Live which they may do dispersed but to live Happily answer∣able to the Dignity of Mankind which End they cannot accomplish without Submission to the Laws and living ac∣cording to the Prescriptions thereof Laws being the Instruments and Si∣news of all outward Blessings It is an  Englishman  's Happiness That as he is Born to Inherit his Lands so to Inhe∣rit the Laws which are our Birthright and the best Inheritance we have which cannot be taken from us  Religion and Justice are the two Sup∣porters of every Commonwealth they are the Pillars of all Government with∣out them the whole State Civil and Ec∣clesiastical will like a melted Vessel run into Confusion and Disorder The Law of a Nation is the Soul of a Nati∣on 'tis the Rudder by which the Vessel of the Commonwealth is steer'd 'tis the Yoke wherewith All are kept in Obedience and that CommonWealth where Men and not Laws govern will be quickly like the Field of the Sluggard all grown over with Thorns and Nettles and therefore there had need be Weeders that is good Magi∣strates to keep the Field of a CommonWealth from being overspread with Thorns and Nettles that is disorder∣ly lewd Persons and they had need be good Laws that must keep in such un∣ruly Beasts the Disturbers of the Peace To what Purpose do Laws enjoin Pu∣nishments if they are not put in Exe∣cution For Laws must not be like Cob∣webs to catch only small Flies and to be broken by great Ones it were bet∣ter not to make any for this makes eve∣ry particular Man's Offence the Sin of the Publick  quis non vetat peccare cum potest jubet  to omit the Punishment  of an Offence under our Charge is to commit it The due Observation of the Laws of God and the careful Ex∣ecution of the Laws of Men make a Na∣tion flourish They are indeed the ve∣ry Spirit and Sinews of every State for all Humane Laws have their Depen∣dance upon the Laws of God who is the Great LawGiver and the nearer our Copies draw to that Original the better they are and the more like to continue  In pessimâ republicâ leges plurimae  And therefore the Curse of the Prophet hath been expounded by the Multitude of penal Laws which are worse than Showers of Hail and Tempest upon the Cattle for they fall upon Men and where Religion and Laws are not preserved we can't pro∣perly call them CommonWealths but  magna latrocinia  great Confederacies of Thieves if Religion be not upheld if the Laws be not observed if Vice goes unpunished and Virtue unrewarded if a due Respect be not given to Magi∣strates who are the living Stamps of the supreme Authority all our Happi∣ness and Contentment in this Life and the next will be taken away and the whole Frame of Government will fall  to the Ground and dissolve The Ru∣lers of the Earth belong unto God and from hence we should learn our Duty of Honour Reverence and Loyalty They were the Sons of  Belial  that de∣spised  Saul  Without Governours or Go∣vernment one Man will be Bread for another and we should be as the Fi∣shes in the Sea the Great would de∣vour the Small It is no particular Con∣ceit but a great Truth that all Duties are by so much the better performed by how much the Men are more reli∣gious from whose Abilities the same proceed But if Magistrates who are employed about the Publick Admini∣stration of Justice follow it only as a Trade for Gains sake the Formalities of it will only then serve to smother Right and what was necessarily ordain∣ed for the common Good will thro' the Abuse of it be the Cause of com∣mon Misery The Laws without Exe∣cution is putting Arrows into a Quiver from whence they are not drawn out this is to make the Magistrate an im∣moveable Statue a  George  on HorseBack seeming always ready but never strikes The Law without Execution is a  Chimera  which only serves to fright  Justice and Fortune are painted blind to shew us what the one should do and what the other should not do for the one gives without Respect and the o∣ther is in no Respect to take for none should execute the Office of Justice but such whose Eyes are blind from respect∣ing Persons and whose Hands are clo∣sed from accepting Rewards The  Thebans  painted their Judges and Ma∣gistrates without Hands since when their Hands are over long 'tis to be feared their Feet will become Gouty their Tongue ty'd their Ears deafened and their Eyes dimmed It is a Shame and Reproach to us to see  Pagans  that have shewed greater Integrity and more Uncorruption and Affection to the Pu∣blick Good than we do  Civillians  say the Magistrate is the living Law and that his good Example should be a lively and perpetual Promulgation of that Law for Example prevails much more than Precept and reduces more under its Yoke tho' naked than the Law with all its Enforcements and the Reason is obvious for the Arms of Law only strike the Body but the Shafts of Example strike into the Soul and we see Men daily trust more to their Eyes than to their Ears more to  what they see than to what they hear  Facilius est errare Naturam quam Prin∣cipem dissimilem sui formare rempubli∣cam  We shall never see Princes frame an Age unlike themselves Under  Ro∣mulus Rome  was warlike under  Nu∣ma  religious under the  Fabritii  conti∣nent under the  Cato's  regular under the  Lucullus  's and  Antonies  intemperate and dissolute under  Julian  Idolatrous under  Valens Arrian  and the Example of King  Jeroboam  caus'd all the People to commit Idolatry whereas under the Reign of King  David Ezekias  and  Josias  Religion and Piety were seen to flourish For People generally are like Clay without Form in themselves but easily wrought by the Potter's Hand They behold most Affairs with the Eyes of their Magistrates and suffer them∣selves easily to be directed by their Ex∣amples and to dislike whatever they reject  An ancient Father hath said  He that is not a good Husband cannot be a good Magistrate  for he that rules not his Fa∣mily well cannot govern others which is a rational Deduction but he that is not an honest Man cannot be a good Magistrate for he that will make Ship∣wrack of his own Reputation will ne∣ver  take Care of the CommonWealth The Justice every Man owes to him∣self does oblige him first to regulate his own Affections and Passions and then he will be more capable to ren∣der Justice to others for both natural and divine Laws do propose our selves for a Rule and Measure of what we owe to our Neighbours Magistrates are to give good Examples to others owing it them∣selves for ordering their own Lives and they owe to it the Publick for Imitation The just and good Man is a Rule and Measure of all others since being what all Men ought to be he shews what all Men ought to do Integrity is so necessary in a Magistrate that without it all other Qualities are but Instruments of particular Profit and Publick Loss All the  Grecian  CommonWealths fell to Ruin for want of this Gold breeds the Scurvy in some Mens Mouths and Ambition breeds Imposthumes in some Mens Hearts He must not look up∣on private Interest but the Publick and submit his particular Affairs to the Interest of the whole  Virtutis pretium est non posse pretio cepi  her Reward is that she cannot be allured by Reward  The Love of the Publick is the inseparable Quality of a Good Com∣monWealthsMan without which he is no more a Man but an Idol as  David  said of the Idols of the  Gen∣tiles That have Eyes and see not Ears and hear not  On OLD AGE  I  Hope it will not be thought unreasonable for an old Man who can scarce re∣member his Climacterical Year who spent his bloom∣ing Youth in the Service of the Crown under King  Charles  the First who in the Battle of  EdgeHill  fought the d of  October  receiv'd a dangerous Wound in his Head still visible as a Mark of Loyalty to his Soveraign and was soon after that Battle made a Cap∣tain of Horse and from thence by de∣grees advanc'd to be a General Offi∣cer of Horse and serv'd in that Quality during those Wars and was engag'd in several Battles with various Successes which ended with the Murther of one of the best of Kings accompany'd with such barbarous Circumstances as cannot be parallel'd in any History and fitter to be bury'd in Oblivion than remem∣bred I have thereupon thought it not improper to shew that the Strength of my Mind is still in being which with God's  Blessing I hope to keep in Repair so long as my Body lasts and have there∣fore presum'd in this following Dis∣course to shew some Advantages of Old Age of which I am at present a living Testimony even in this Year  The Life of Man is usually divided into Childhood Youth Man's Estate and Old Age all which Degrees we bring into that narrow Compass whilst our Life consumes insensibly Infancy is only a State of Hope and most com∣monly supported by the indulgent Ten∣derness of Parents and Nurses Youth if well Educated will soon blossom and after yield Fruit Man's Estate like a Flame well kindled and supply'd will burn long but Old Age does usually soon pass away and if we do not watch we lose our Opportunities if we do not make haste we are left behind our best Hours fly from us the worst are to come the purest Part of our Life runs first and leaves only the Dregs at the Bottom unless we take great Care and then our Strength and Desires will fall off together and our Years will sit easie upon us when we're thus satisfy'd and compos'd it smooths our Passage  to the other World and makes us slide into the Grave with a more gentle and insensible Motion Indeed if we could observe the State of our Infancy when we came first into the World with the Progress of our Growth and the Be∣ginning of our Reason it would certainly be a pleasant Retrospection but divine Providence hath hid this from our Sight At our Birth neither our Limbs nor Understanding were born at their full Growth but we encrease by Degrees and being Infants in our Bodies we are not Men in our Souls The first ten Years we may call an Animal Life the Powers of Reason are then feeble in us and we do but sleep that Time away but afterwards the Advances of Age are very gradual but yet this Gradation is so slow that we cannot take much No∣tice of it nor see it with our Eyes and so we think all goes well since we are not thrown so suddenly out of our Youth into our Manhood and from that into Old Age which would be much more sensible to us and concerns us more But we walk gently up Hill from our Youth to our middle State and as gently down the Hill from our Man∣hood into Old Age without perceiv∣ing  the Change we have made 'till we come at the Bottom However we must needs be troubled when we con∣sider the greatest Part of Life is no bet∣ter than a slow Consumption and that at last we must fall into a State of Weak∣ness and be unacceptable both to o∣thers and to our selves But we sel∣dom think of this because we seem to be the same Men in the Morning as we were the Night before Now he that would have his Health hold out to the last and grow old with Advantage must be regular in his Youth and not live too fast We must husband our Constituti∣on and not throw it away 'till we have done living for our Vices destroy our Lives as well as our Fortunes Intem∣perance antidates our Infirmities and makes us die much sooner than we should and tho' we have the World be∣fore us we do not play the good Hus∣band early enough for 'tis too late to spare at the Bottom when all is drawn out to the Lees 'Tis true we old Men cannot but be something con∣cerned to think that we grow less and less every Day doing the same things over again and that we live only to nurse up our Decays which is trou∣blesome  to us especially since there is nothing in this World to make us in love with it or fond of it none yet were ever fully pleas'd with it for tho' it seems a  Juno  in the Pursuit 'tis but a Cloud in our Embraces and there∣fore those who are sorry to see their Voyage fixed are overfond of their native Country and hang about Life a little too meanly Indeed when our Senses droop and all the Faculties of our Souls and Bodies decay apace it is then high time to bid adieu to the active Life and not only to abandon the Vanities of this fading World but the very Remembrance and Thoughts of them Our Minds begin then to be nauseated with the Ideas of our past Folly which we falsly call'd Pleasure and that Retrospect is unpleasant when we re∣flect upon a Life to be repented of It is but Reason when we approach near the Grave when all our Senses put us daily in Mind of our Mortality that we should begin to recollect our selves and think whereabouts we are that we may not be surpriz'd and die less than our selves It should be our Care be∣fore we grow old to live well and then we may be sure to die well It is the  Duty of Life to prepare our selves for Death there is not one Hour we live that does not mind us of our Mortality Time runs on the Period is certain tho' it lyes in the Dark our Term is set and none of us know how near it is and therefore we should not won∣der to have that befall us to Day which might have happened to us any Minute since we were born This Con∣sideration should make us live as if e∣very Minute were our last But we fear Death only because we know not where we shall go and we never begin to reform 'till our old Age after ha∣ving spent our former Years in all Sorts of Vanity which is better late than never but 'tis a miserable Case not to know the Value of a Treasure 'till we are going to lose it To begin our Frugality when we are ready to turn Bankrupts We should therefore begin early to do that which will al∣ways please and young Men should carefully avoid throwing away their Time as if they came into the World for no other End but to eat and sleep or else to spend their Days in Wan∣tonness and Folly and to make Vice  their Business Thus we see in gene∣ral that Age grows worse upon the Pro∣gress and hath no Relief to expect but the Grave yet in some Health Vigour and Sense hold out to the last Many of the ancient Philosophers and  Romans  were Examples of this Truth  Tully  who wrote excellently well  de Senectute  was a lively Example hereof being past Sixty when he wrote his  Philippicks  in which his Rheto∣rick is more correct and moving than in his younger Orations The Poe∣tick Fire which is usually soonest ex∣tinct in Men I have found by Expe∣rience in my self hath lasted much beyond that Period of which I could give modern Proof but I will leave that to my Son only this I can with Truth affirm that the Poems I have made since my Age of Seventy have more of Force and Spirit than those I had written some Years before but this is a particular Grace of God it being very unusual in the Generality and ve∣ry hard for Men to seem young when they're old and much more strange to be so for tho' at ones Death  Fuimus  may make a good Motto yet in Life 'tis stark naught  None can imagine how green and vigorous some Mens Minds are in Old Age having a perpetual Conflict with their Bodies who were illmatch'd unless to shew that an active Spirit may be lodged in a decay'd Body It is certainly a particular Happiness to preserve the Force of the Mind in the Decay of the Body to live to that Age that neither cares for any thing nor stands in need of any thing that tho' it can much longer yet it will not still do the same Things over again which it ought not to do Age ha∣ving put an End to his Desires cer∣tainly there can be no gentler End than thus to melt away in a kind of Dissolution  Where Fire meets with Opposition and Matter to work upon it is furi∣ous and rages but when it finds no Fuel as in Old Age it goes out quick∣ly for want of Nourishment nor is the Body the settled Habitation of the Soul but a temporary Lodging which we must leave whenever the Master of the House pleases 'Tis true every Man hath naturally a Love for his own Body as poor People love even their own beggarly Cottages They are  old Acquaintances and loath to part yet old Men tho' they may some∣what indulge their Bodies yet they make not themselves Slaves to them nor care any more what becomes of their Carkasses when dead than a Man does for the shaving of his Beard under the Hand of a Barber How∣ever Age it self is not without its Pleasures if we knew rightly how to use them the best Morsel being still reserved for the last or almost it is equivalent to the enjoying of Plea∣sures not to stand in need of them Time indeed goes faster with old Men than young because they rec∣kon most upon it There is hardly any Man so old but he may hope for one Day more yet and the longest Life is but a Multiplication of Days nay Hours and Moments for the End of our Lives is set and the first Breath we draw is but the first Step to our last the Course of all Things in this World being only a long Connection of Providential Appointments and tho' there be great Variety in our Lives yet all tend to the same Is∣sue Death old Men find most easie because it is comply'd with without  strugling for by dying of old Age a Man does no more than go to Bed when he is weary it being childish to go out of the World as we came into it groan∣ing and crying For these and many other Reasons I cannot agree with them that seem to impute much Inconveni∣ence to long Life and that length of Days does much rather impair than im∣prove us for if we follow the Course of Nature and of Reason old Age is a mighty Blessing were it only in re∣gard that it gives Time leave to vent and boil away the Unquietness and Turbulency that follow our Pas∣sions in our younger Years and weans us gently from carnal Affections and at last to drop with Ease and Willing∣ness like ripe Fruit from the Tree for when before the Season Fruit is pull'd off with violent Hands or shaken down by rude and boisterous Winds it hath an indigested raw taste of the Wood and hath an unpleasant Eagerness in its Juice that makes it unfit for Use till length of time hath mellowed it so Souls that go out of their Bodies with Affection to those Objects they leave behind which usually is as long as they can relish them do retain still as some  think even to their Separation a By∣ass and Languishing toward them Be∣sides we must consider that old Age is not always a Burthen and Incum∣brance there are several peculiar Pri∣vileges annexed to this part of Life which will relieve us under the Decays of the Body for the Imperfections of old Age are not so unavoidable as grey Hairs The quiet Composure of an old Man's Mind keeps him from wearing out so fast it props up his Strength and makes him live cheer∣fully to the last Moment for easie Thoughts are excellent Opiates which will not only mitigate old Men's Di∣stemper but make them almost to despise their Misery Thus most Men take Care to live long but few take Care to live well which is in every Man's Power to do but in no Man's Power to do the former  We consume our Lives in providing the very Instruments of Life so that we do not properly live but we are about to live and we only propound to begin to live at our old Age to which very few People arrive  There are other very remarkable Advantages of old Age for those  who have had the longest Time to im∣prove themselves must needs be the wisest Men such have seen greater Va∣riety of Events have had more Oppor∣tunities of observing Humours and In∣terests Their Judgments are more ex∣act they know more things and those better than young Men bringing their Thoughts to a second Test for trying what they took upon Trust in their Youth Old Men are usually free from violent Passions matters of Moment are better consider'd by them whereas younger Persons are apt to judge amiss their Prospect being too short and certainly Age is the time in which the Mind is most discerning and furnisht with the best Materials for Wisdom Those who have been longest in publick Employments whose Performances have been more than ordi∣nary who have done most Service for their King and Country deserve cer∣tainly a more particular Respect and should be considered with more Re∣gards and should have the fairest Ac∣knowledgments and treated with the best Civility like parting Friends that are ready to take leave of the World but alas this seldom happens for old  Services are usually forgotten especi∣ally in an Age where young Men see Visions and old Men Dream their former Actions and repeated good Ser∣vices being no more taken notice of than if they had never been tho' even Decency and GoodNature should at least make them be respected for them  Thus the State of Mortals in this Life is very changeable if we are in∣vited to cast Anchor awhile in some calm serene Season if we are permit∣ted to Careen and Recruit our Wea∣therbeaten Spirits enjoying some short interval of Rest and Ease the Indul∣gence soon expires and we are forced to hoist Sail with double Diligence least we suffer a Wreck for we fly at Random in a Sea of perpetual Hazards and Difficulties and yet the shortness of Life is the common Complaint of most People who make it short either by doing ill doing nothing or doing Things besides their Business so that this large extent of Life will not per∣haps amount to the Minority of Man so that it may be a long Being perhaps a short Life for it is not the Num∣ber of Years that makes Death easie to  us but the Temper of the Mind he that would live a little longer this Day would be as loth to Die a thousand Years hence Go we must at last no matter how soon 'Tis the Work of the Al∣mighty to make us live long but 'tis own Business to make a short Life suf∣ficient Life is to be measur'd by our Actions not by Time A Man may die old at Thirty and young at Eighty the one lives after Death the other pe∣rished before he died And therefore that Noble General  Similis  who lived to a great Age and retired from Busi∣ness to his Devotion Seven Years before his Death would have only this Epi∣taph in Substance engrav'd upon his Tombstone  Here lies  Similis  of a ve∣ry great Age and yet lived only Seven Years  Old Age is the Effect of Providence How long I shall live is only in God's Power but it's in my Power how well How great a shame is it then to be lay∣ing new Foundations of Life at our last Gasp for an old Man with one Foot in the Grave to go to School again While we are young we may learn be∣cause our Minds are then tractable and our Bodies fit for Labour but  when old Age comes on we are com∣monly seiz'd with Sloath and afflicted with Diseases and at last we leave the World as Ignorant as we came into it only we die worse than we were born which is our own Fault I wish with all my Soul that I had thought better and sooner of my End but I must now make the more haste and being in good Health I must Spur on like those that set out late upon a Journey It is better to learn late than not at all altho' it be only to instruct me how I may leave the Stage of this World with a perfect Resignation with a true Sense of the Sins of my forepassed Life with a true Fear of God and a sure Trust in his Mercy and thus I shall sink with Ease into my Grave and tho' I die old I shall rise young in the other World for that State is an eternal Spring ever flourishing and shall gently pass from one Extream to another  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for and Sold by  Jonas Brown  at the  Black Swan  without  TempleBar  ELeven Sermons
