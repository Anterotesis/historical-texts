 THE  MOURNING BRIDE  A TRAGEDY  THE  MOURNING BRIDE  A TRAGEDY As it is ACTED AT THE Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  BY His Majesty's Servants  Written by Mr  CONGREVE  Neque enim lex aequior ulla  Qu√†m necis artifices arte perire sua  Ovid de Arte Am  The THIRD EDITION  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  And Sold by  R Wellington G Strahan  and  B Lintott    TO Her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS  MADAM  THAT high Station which by Your Birth You hold above the People exacts from every one as a Duty whatever Honours they are capable of paying to Your Royal Highness But that more exalted Place to which Your Virtues have rais'd You above  the rest of Princes makes the Tribute of our Admiration and Praise rather a Choice more immediately preventing that Duty  The Publick Gratitude is ever founded on a Publick Benefit and what is universally Bless'd is always an universal Blessing Thus from Your self we derive the Offerings which we bring and that Incense which arises to Your Name only returns to its Original and but naturally requires the Parent of its Being  From hence it is that this Poem constituted on a Moral whose End is to recommend and to encourage Virtue of consequence has recourse to Your Royal Highness's Patronage aspiring to cast it self beneath Your Feet and declining Approbation 'till You shall condescend to own it and vouchsafe to shine upon it as on a Creature of Your Influence  'Tis from the Example of Princes that Virtue becomes a Fashion in the People for even they who are averse to Instruction will yet be fond of Imitation  But there are Multitudes who never can have Means nor Opportunities of so near an Access as to partake of the Benefit of such Examples And to these Tragedy which distinguishes it self from the Vulgar Poetry by the Dignity of its Characters may be of Use and Information For they who are at that distance from Original Greatness as to be depriv'd of the Happiness of Contemplating the Perfections and real Excellencies of Your Royal Highnes's Person in Your Court may yet behold some small Sketches and Imagings of the Virtues of Your Mind abstracted and represented in the Theatre  Thus Poets are instructed and instruct not alone by Precepts which persuade but also by Examples which illustrate Thus is Delight interwoven with Instruction when not only Virtue is prescrib'd but also represented  But if we are delighted with the Liveliness of a feign'd Representation of Great and Good Persons and their Actions how must  we be charm'd with beholding the Persons themselves If one or two excelling Qualities barely touch'd in the single Action and small Compass of a Play can warm an Audience with a Concern and Regard even for the seeming Success and Prosperity of the Actor with what Zeal must the Hearts of all be fill'd for the continued and encreasing Happiness of those who are the true and living Instances of Elevated and Persisting Virtue Even the Vicious themselves must have a secret Veneration for those peculiar Graces and Endowments which are daily so eminently conspicuous in Your Royal Highness and though repining feel a Pleasure which in spite of Envy they perforce approve  If in this Piece humbly offer'd to Your Royal Highness there shall appear the Resemblance of any one of those many Excellencies which You so promiscuously possess to be drawn so as to merit Your least Approbation it has the End and Accomplishment of its Design And however imperfect  it may be in the Whole through the Inexperience or Incapacity of the Author yet if there is so much as to convince Your Royal Highness that a Play may be with Industry so dispos'd in spight of the licentious Practice of the Modern Theatre as to become sometimes an innocent and not unprofitable Entertainment it will abundantly gratifie the Ambition and recompence the Endeavours of  Your Royal Highness's  Most Obedient and most humbly Devoted Servant William Congreve  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  Betterton  THE Time has been when Plays were not so plenty  And a less Number New would well content ye  New Plays did then like Almanacks appear  And One was thought sufficient for a Year  Tho' they are more like Almanacks of late  For in one Year I think they're out of Date  Nor were they without Reason join'd together  For just as one prognosticates the Weather  How plentiful the Crop or scarce the Grain  What Peals of Thunder and what Show'rs of Rain  So t'other can foretel by certain Rules  What Crops of Coxcombs or what Floods of Fools  In such like Prophecies were Poets skill'd  Which now they find in their own Tribe fulfill'd  The Dearth of Wit they did so long presage  Is fall'n on us and almost starves the Stage  Were you not griev'd as often as you saw  Poor Actors thresh such empty Sheafs of Straw  Toiling and lab'ring at their Lungs Expence  To start a Jest or force a little Sense  Hard Fate for us still harder in th' Event  Our Authors Sin but we alone Repent  Still they proceed and at our Charge write worse  'Twere some Amends if they could reimburse  But there's the Devil tho' their Cause is lost  There's no recovering Damages or Cost  Good Wits forgive this Liberty we take  Since Custom gives the Losers leave to speak  But if provok'd your dreadful Wrath remains  Take your Revenge upon the coming Scenes  For that damn'd Poet's spar'd who Damns a Brother  As one Thief 'scapes that Executes another  Thus far alone does to the Wits relate  But from the rest we hope a better Fate  To please and move has been our Poet's Theme  Art may direct but Nature is his Aim  And Nature miss'd in vain he boasts his Art  For only Nature can affect the Heart  Then freely judge the Scenes that shall ensue  But as with Freedom judge with Candour too  He wou'd not lose thro' Prejudice his Cause  Nor wou'd obtain precariously Applause  Impartial Censure he requests from all  Prepar'd by just Decrees to stand or fall  Personae Dramatis  MAnuel  the King of  Granada  Mr  Verbruggen  Gonsalez  his Favourite  Mr

in Mourning  Leonora  waiting in Mourning  After the Musick  Almeria  rises from her Chair and comes forward  Alm  Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast  To soften Rocks or bend a knotted Oak  I've read that things inanimate have mov'd  And as with living Souls have been inform'd  By Magick Numbers and persuasive Sound  What then am I Am I more senseless grown  Than Trees or Flint O force of constant Woe  'Tis not in Harmony to calm my Griefs  Anselmo  sleeps and is at Peace last Night  The silent Tomb receiv'd the good old King  He and his Sorrows now are safely lodg'd  Within its cold but hospitable Bosom  Why am not I at Peace  Leon  For Heaven's sake dear Madam moderate  Your Griefs there is no Cause  Alm  PeaceNo Cause yes there is Eternal Cause  And Misery Eternal will succeed  Thou canst not tellthou hast indeed no Cause  Leo  Believe me Madam I lament  Anselmo  And always did compassionate his Fortune  Have often wept to see how cruelly  Your Father kept in Chains his FellowKing  And oft at Night when all have been retir'd  Have stoln from Bed and to his Prison crept  Where while his Goaler slept I thro' the Grate  Have softly whisper'd and enquir'd his Health  Sent in my Sighs and Pray'rs for his Deliv'rance  For Sighs and Pray'rs were all that I could offer  Alm  Indeed thou hast a soft and gentle Nature  That thus couldst melt to see a Stranger's Wrongs  O  Leonora  hadst thou known  Anselmo  How would thy Heart have bled to see his Suff'rings  Thou hadst no Cause but general Compassion  Leo  My Love of you my Royal Mistress gave me Cause  My Love of you begot my Grief for him  For I had heard that when the Chance of War  Had bless'd  Anselmo  's Arms with Victory  And the rich Spoil of all the Field and you  The Glory of the whole were made the Prey  Of his Success that then in spite of Hate  Revenge and that Hereditary Feud  Entail'd between  Valentia  's and  Granada  's Kings  He did endear himself to your Affection  By all the worthy and indulgent Ways  His most industrious Goodness cou'd invent  Proposing by a Match between  Alphonso  His Son the brave  Valentia  Prince and you  To end the long Dissention and unite  The jarring Crowns  Alm  O  Alphonso Alphonso  thou art too  At Peace Father and Son are now no more  Then why am I O when shall I have Rest  Why do I live to say you are no more  Why are all these things thus  Is there necessity I must be miserable  Is it of moment to the Peace of Heav'n  That I should be afflicted thusIf not  Why is it thus contriv'd Why are all things laid  By some unseen Hand so as of consequence  They must to me bring Curses Grief of Heart  The last Distress of Life and sure Despair  Leo  Alas you search too far and think too deeply  Alm  Why was I carried to  Anselmo  's Court  Or when there why was I us'd so tenderly  Why did he not use me like an Enemy  For so my Father would have us'd his Child  O  Alphonso Alphonso  Devouring Seas have wash'd thee from my sight  But there's no time shall rase thee from my Memory  No I will live to be thy Monument  The cruel Ocean would deprive thee of a Tomb  But in my Heart thou art interr'd there there  Thy dear Resemblance is for ever fix'd  My Love my Lord my Husband still though lost  Leo  Husband O Heav'ns  Alm  What have I said  My Grief has hurry'd me beyond all Thought  I would have kept that secret though I know  Thy Love and Faith to me deserve all Confidence  But 'tis the Wretches Comfort still to have  Some small Reserve of near and inward Woe  Some unsuspected Hoard of darling Grief  Which they unseen may wail and weep and mourn  And Gluttonlike alone devour  Leo  Indeed I knew not this  Alm  O no thou know'st not halfthou know'st nothing  If thou didst  If I should tell thee wouldst thou pity me  Tell me I know thou wou'dst thou art compassionate  Leo  Witness these Tears  Alm  I thank theeindeed I do  I thank thee that thou'lt pity thy sad Mistress  For 'tis the poor Prerogative of Greatness  To be wretched and unpitied  But I did promise I would tell theeWhat  My Griefs Thou do'st already know 'em  And when I said thou didst know nothing  It was because thou didst not know  Alphonso  For to have known my Loss thou must have known  His Worth his Truth and tenderness of Love  Leo  The Memory of that brave Prince stands fair  In all Report  And I have heard imperfectly his Loss  But fearful to renew your Troubles past  I never did presume to ask the Story  Alm  If for my swelling Heart I can I'll tell thee  I was a welcome Captive in  Valentia  Ev'n on the Day when  Manuel  my Father  Led on his conqu'ring Troops high as the Gates  Of King  Anselmo  's Palace which in Rage  And Heat of War and dire Revenge he fir'd  Whilst the good King to shun approaching Flames  Started amidst his Foes and made Captivity his Refuge  Would I had perish'd in those Flames  But 'twas not so decreed  Alphonso  who foresaw my Father's Cruelty  Had born the Queen and me on board a Ship  Ready to sail and when this News was brought  We put to Sea but being betray'd by some  Who knew our Flight we closely were pursu'd  And almost taken when a sudden Storm  Drove us and those that follow'd on the Coast  Of  Africk  There our Vessel struck the Shoar  And bulging 'gainst a Rock was dash'd in pieces  But Heaven spared me for yet more Affliction  Conducting them who follow'd us to shun  The Shoal and save me floating on the Waves  While the good Queen and my  Alphonso  perish'd  Leo  Alas were you then wedded to  Alphonso  Alm  That Day that fatal Day our Hands were join'd  For when my Lord beheld the Ship pursuing  And saw her Rate so far exceeding ours  He came to me and begg'd me by my Love  I would consent the Priest might make us one  That whether Death or Victory ensu'd  I might be his beyond the Power of future Fate  The Queen too did assist his SuitI granted  And in one Day was wedded and a Widow  Leo  Indeed 'twas mournful  Alm  'Twas that  For which I mourn and will for ever mourn  Nor will I change these black and dismal Robes  Or ever dry these swol'n and watry Eyes  Or ever taste Content or Peace of Heart  While I have Life or Memory of my  Alphonso  Leo  Look down good Heav'n with Pity on her Sorrows  And grant that Time may bring her some Relief  Alm  O no Time gives Encrease to my Afflictions  The circling Hours that gather all the Woes  Which are diffus'd thro' the revolving Year  Come heavyladen with the oppressing Weight  To me with me successively they leave  The Sighs the Tears the Groans the restless Cares  And all the Damps of Grief that did retard their Flight  They shake their downy Wings and scatter all  The dire collected Dews on my poor Head  Then flie with Joy and Swiftness from me  Leo  Hark  The distant Shouts proclaim your Father's Triumph  Shouts at a distance  O cease for Heaven's sake asswage a little  This Torrent of your Grief for much I fear  It will incense him thus to see you drown'd  In Tears when Joy appears in ev'ry other Face  Alm  And Joy he brings to ev'ry other Heart  But double double weight of Woe to mine  For with Him  Garcia  comes  Garcia  to whom  I must be sacrific'd and all the Faith  And Vows I gave my De  Alphonso  basely  Violated  No it shall never be for I will die first  Die Ten thousand DeathsLook down look down  Kneels  Alphonso  hear the Sacred Vow I make  Leave for a Moment to behold Eternal Bliss  And bend thy glorious Eyes to Earth and me  And thou  Anselmo  if yet thou art arriv'd  Thro' all Impediments of purging Fire  To that bright Heav'n where my  Alphonso  reigns  Behold thou also and attend my Vow  If ever I do yield or give Consent  By any Action Word or Thought to Wed  Another Lord may then just Heav'n show'r down  Unheard of Curses on me greater far  If such there be in angry Heav'n's Vengeance  Than any I have yet endur'dAnd now  Rising  Methinks my Heart has some Relief Having  Discharg'd this Debt incumbent on my Love  Yet one thing more I would engage from thee  Leo  My Heart my Life and Will are only yours  Alm  I thank thee 'Tis but this anon when all  Are busied in the general Joy that thou  Wilt privately with me  Steal forth and visit good  Anselmo  's Tomb  Leo  Alas I fear some fatal Resolution  Alm  No on my Life my Faith I mean no Violence  I feel I'm more at large  Since I have made this Vow  Perhaps I would repeat it there more solemnly  'Tis that or some such melancholy Thought  Upon my Word no more  Leo  I will attend you  Enter  Alonzo  Alon  The Lord  Gonsalez  comes to tell your Highness  Of the King's approach  Alm  Conduct him in  Exit  Alon  That's his Pretence I know his Errand is  To fill my Ears with  Garcia  's valiant Deeds  And with his artful Tongue to gild and magnifie  His Son's Exploits  But I am arm'd with Ice around my Heart  Not to be warm'd with Words nor idle Eloquence  Enter  Gonsalez  Bowing very humbly  Gons  Be ev'ry Day of your long Life like this  The Sun bright Conquest and your brighter Eyes  Have all conspir'd to blaze promiscuous Light  And bless this Day with most unequal Lustre  Your Royal Father my Victorious Lord  Loaden with Spoils and everliving Laurel  Is entring now in Martial Pomp the Palace  Five hundred Mules precede his solemn March  Which groan beneath the Weight of  Moorish  Wealth  Chariots of War adorn'd with glittering Gems  Succeed and next a hundred neighing Steeds  White as the fleecy Rain on  Alpine  Hills  That bound and foam and champ the Golden Bit  As they disdain'd the Victory they grace  Prisoners of War in shining Fetters follow  And Captains of the Noblest Blood of  Africk  Sweat by his Chariot Wheel and lick and grind  With gnashing Teeth the Dust his Triumphs raise  The swarming Populace spread every Wall  And cling as if with Claws they did enforce  Their Hold thro' clifted Stones stretching and staring  As if they were all of Eyes and every Limb  Would feed his Faculty of Admiration  While you alone retire and shun this Sight  This Sight which is indeed not seen tho' twice  The Multitude should gaze  In Absence of your Eyes  Alm  My Lord my Eyes ungratefully behold  The gilded Trophics of exterior Honours  Nor will my Ears be charm'd with sounding Words  Or pompous Phrase the Pageantry of Souls  But that my Father is return'd in Safety  I bend to Heav'n with Thanks and humble Praise  Gons  Excellent Princess  But 'tis a Task unfit for my weak Age  With dying Words to offer at your Praise  Garcia  my Son your Beauty's lowest Slave  Has better done  In proving with his Sword upon your Foes  The Force and Influence of your matchless Charms  Alm  I doubt not of the worth of  Garcia  's Deeds  Which had been brave tho' I had ne'er been born  Leo  Madam the King  Flourish  Alm  My Women I wou'd meet him  Attendants to  Almeria  enter in Mourning  Symphony of Warlike Musick Enter the King attended by  Garcia  and several Officers Files of Prisoners in Chains and Guards who are ranged in Order round the Stage  Almeria  meets the King and kneels afterwards  Gonsalez  kneels and kisses the King's Hand while  Garcia  does the same to the Princess  King  Almeria  riseMy best  Gonsalez  rise  What Tears my good old Friend  Gons  But Tears of Joy To see you thus has fill'd  My Eyes with more Delight than they can hold  King  By Heav'n thou lov'st me and I'm pleas'd thou dost  Take it for Thanks Old Man that I rejoice  To see thee weep on this OccasionBut some  Here are who seem to mourn at our Success  How is it  Almeria  that you meet our Eyes  Upon this solemn Day in these sad Weeds  You and yours are all in opposition  To my Brightness like Daughters of Affliction  Alm  Forgive me Sir if I offend  The Year which I have vow'd to pay to Heav'n  In Mourning and strict Life for my Deliverance  From Death and Wreck of the tempestuousSea  Wants yet to be expired  King  Your Zeal to Heav'n is great so is your Debt  Yet something too is due to me who gave  That Life which Heav'n preserv'd A Day bestow'd  In Filial Duty had atton'd and giv'n  A Dispensation to your VowNo more  'Twas weak and wilfuland a Woman's Error  Yetupon thought it doubly wounds my Sight  To see that Sable worn upon the Day  Succeeding that in which our deadliest Foe  Hated  Anselmo  was interr'dBy Heav'n  It looks as thou didst mourn for him Just as  Thy senseless Vow appear'd to bear its Date  Not from that Hour wherein thou wert preserv'd  But that wherein the curs'd  Alphonso  perish'd  Ha what thou dost not weep to think of that  Gons  Have Patience Royal Sir the Princess weeps  To have offended you If Fate decreed  One pointed Hour should be  Alphonso  's Loss  And her Deliverance is she to blame  King  I tell thee she's to blame not to have feasted  When my first Foe was laid in Earth such Enmity  Such Detestation bears my Blood to his  My Daughter should have revell'd at his Death  She should have made these Palace Walis to shake  And all this high and ample Roof to ring  With her Rejoicings What to mourn and weep  Then then to weep and pray and grieve By Heav'n  There's not a Slave a shackled Slave of mine  But should have smil'd that Hour through all his Care  And shook his Chains in Transport and rude Harmony  Gons  What she has done was in excess of Goodness  Betray'd by too much Piety to seem  As if she had offended  King  To seem is to commit at this Conjuncture  I wonot have the seeming of a Sorrow seen  To DayRetire divest your self with speed  Of that offensive Black on me be all  The Violation of your Vow  You stand excused that I command it  Gar kneeling  Your Pardon Sir if I presume so far  As to remind you of your gracious Promise  King  Rise  Garcia  I forgot Yet stay  Almeria  Alm  O my boding HeartWhat is your Pleasure Sir  King  Draw near and give your Hand and  Garcia  yours  Receive this Lord as one whom I have found  Worthy to be your Husband and my Son  Gar  Thus let me kneel to takeO not to take  But to devote and yield my self for ever  The Slave and Creature of my Royal Mistress  Gons  O let me prostrate pay my worthless Thanks  For this high Honour  King  No more my Promise long since pass'd thy Loyalty  And  Garcia  's welltry'd Valour all oblige me  This Day we Triumph but to Morrow's Sun  Shall shine on  Garcia  's Nuptials  Alm  Oh  Faints  Gar  Alas she faints help to support her  Gons  She recovers  King  A Bridal Qualm soon off How is't  Almeria  Alm  A sudden Chilness seizes on my Spirits  Your Leave Sir to retire  King  Garcia  Conduct her  Garcia  leads  Almeria  to the Door and returns  This idle Vow hangs on her Woman's Fears  I'll have a Priest shall Preach her from her Faith  And make it Sin not to renounce that Vow  Which I'd have broken  Trumpets  Enter  Alonzo  Offic  The beauteous Captive  Zara  is arriv'd  And with a Train as if she still were Wife  To  Albucacim  and the  Moor  had conquer'd  King  It is our Will she should be so attended  Bear hence these Prisoners  Garcia  which is he  Of whose mute Valour you relate such Wonders  Prisoners led off  Gar  Osmyn  who led the  Moorish  Horse he does  Great Sir at her Request attend on  Zara  King  He is your Prisoner as you please dispose him  Gar  I would oblige him but he shuns my Kindness  And with a haughty Mien and stern Civility  Humbly declines all Offers If he speak  'Tis scarce above a Word as he were born  Alone to do and did disdain to talk  At least to talk where he must not command  King  Such Sullenness and in a Man so brave  Must have some other Cause than his Captivity  Did  Zara  then request he might attend her  Gar  My Lord she did  King  That join'd with his Behaviour  Begets a Doubt I'd have 'em watch'd perhaps  Her Chains hang heavier on him than his own  Flourish and Enter  Zara  and  Osmyn  bound conducted by  Perez  and a Guard and attended by  Selim  and several Mutes and Eunuchs in a Train  King  What Welcome and what Honours beauteous  Zara  A King and Conqueror can give are yours  A Conqueror indeed where you are won  Who with such Lustre strike admiring Eyes  That had our Pomp been with your Presence grac'd  Th' expecting Crowd had been deceiv'd and seen  Their Monarch enter not Triumphant but  In Triumph led your Beauty's Slave  Zara  If I on any Terms could condescend  To like Captivity or think those Honours  Which Conquerors in Courtesie bestow  Of equal Value with unborrow'd Rule  And Native Right to Arbitrary Sway  I might be pleas'd when I behold this Train  With usual Homage wait But when I feel  These Bonds I look with Loathing on my self  And scorn vile Slavery tho' doubly hid  Beneath MockPraises and dissembled State  King  Those Bonds 'Twas my Command you should be free  How durst you  Perez  disobey me  Perez  Great Sir  Your Order was she should not wait your Triumph  But at some distance follow thus attended  King  'Tis false 'twas more I bad she should be free  If not in Words I bad it by my Eyes  Her Eyes did more than bidFree her and hers  With speedyet staymy Hands alone can make  Fit Restitution hereThus I release you  And by releasing you enslave my self  Zara  Favours conferr'd tho' when unsought deserve  Acknowledgment from Noble Minds Such Thanks  As one hating to be oblig'd  Yet hating more Ingratitude can pay  I offer  King  Born to Excel and to Command  As by transcendent Beauty to attract  All Eyes so by Preheminence of Soul  To rule all Hearts  Garcia  what's he who with contracted Brow  Beholding  Osmyn  as they unbind him  And sullen Port glooms downward with his Eyes  At once regardless of his Chains or Liberty  Gar  That Sir is  Osmyn  King  He answers well the Character you gave him  Whence comes it Valiant  Osmyn  that a Man  So great in Arms as thou art said to be  So ill can brook Captivity  The common Chance of War  Osm  Because Captivity has robb'd me of a just Revenge  King  I understand not that  Osm  I would not have you  Zara  That Gallant  Moor  in Battel lost a Friend  Whom more than Life he lov'd and the Regret  Of not revenging on his Foes that Loss  Has caus'd this Melancholy and Despair  King  She does excuse him 'tis as I suspected  To  Gons  Gons  That Friend may be her self show no Resentment  Of his Arrogance yet she looks concern'd  King  I'll have Enquiry made his Friend may be  A Prisoner His Name  Zara  Heli  King  Garcia  be it your Care to make that search  It shall be mine to pay Devotion here  At this Fair Shrine to lay my Laurels down  And raise Love's Altar on the Spoils of War  Conquest and Triumph now are mine no more  Nor will I Victory in Camps adore  For ling'ring there in long suspence she stands  Shifting the Prize in unresolving Hands  Unus'd to wait I broke through her Delay  Fix'd her by Force and snatch'd the doubtful Day  But late I find that War is but her Sport  In Love the Goddess keeps her awful Court  Fickle in Fields unsteadily she flies  But Rules with settled Sway in  Zara  's Eyes  Ex Omnes  The End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  Representing the Isle of a Temple  Enter  Garcia Heli  and  Perez  Gar  THIS Way we're told  Osmyn  was seen to walk  Chusing this lonely Mansion of the Dead  To mourn brave  Heli  thy mistaken Fate  Hel  Let Heav'n with Thunder to the Centre strike me  If to arise in very Deed from Death  And to revisit with my long clos'd Eyes  This living Light could to my Soul or Sense  Afford a Thought or Glimpse of Joy  In least Proportion to the vast Delight  I feel to hear of  Osmyn  's Name to hear  That  Osmyn  lives and I again shall see him  Gar  Unparallell'd Fidelity  I've heard with Admiration of your Friendship  And could with equal Joy and Envy view  The Transports of your Meeting  Perez  Yonder my Lord behold the Noble  Moor  Hel  Where where  Gar  I see him not  Perez  I saw him when I spoke thwarting my View  And striding with distemper'd Haste his Eyes  Seem'd Flame and flash'd upon me with a Glance  Then forward shot their Fires which he pursu'd  As to some Object frightful yet not fear'd  Gar  Let's haste to follow him and know the Cause  Hel  My Lord let me entreat you to forbear  Leave me alone to find and cure the Cause  I know his Melancholy and such Starts  Are usual to his Temper It might raise him  To act some Violence upon himself  So to be caught in an unguarded Hour  And when his Soul gives all her Passions way  Secure and loose in friendly Solitude  I know his Noble Heart would burst with Shame  To be surpriz'd by Strangers in its Frailty  Gar  Go gen'rous  Heli  and relieve your Friend  Far be it from me officiously to pry  Or press upon the Privacies of others  Hel  Y'are truly Noble  Exit  Gar  Perez  the King expects from our Return  To have his Jealousie confirm'd or clear'd  Of that appearing Love which  Zara  bears  To  Osmyn  but some other Opportunity  Must make that plain  Perez  To me 'twas long since plain  And ev'ry Look of his and hers confess it  Gar  If so Unhappiness attends their Love  And I cou'd pity 'em I hear some coming  The Friends perhaps are met let us avoid 'em  Exeunt  Enter  Almeria  and  Leonora  Alm  It was a fancy'd Noise for all is hush'd  Leo  It bore the Accent of a Human Voice  Alm  It was thy Fear or else some transient Wind  Whistling thro' Hollows of the vaulted Isle  We'll listen  Leo  Hark  Alm  No all is hush'd and still as Death'Tis dreadful  How rev'rend is the Face of this tall Pile  Whose ancient Pillars rear their Marble Heads  To bear aloft its arch'd and pond'rous Roof  By its own Weight made stedfast and immoveable  Looking Tranquility It strikes an Awe  And Terror on my aking Sight the Tombs  And Monumental Caves of Death look Cold  And shoot a Chilness to my trembling Heart  Give me thy Hand and speak to me nay speak  And let me hear thy Voice  My own affrights me with its Eccho's  Leo  Let us return the Horror of this Place  And Silence will encrease your Melancholy  Alm  It may my Fears but cannot add to that  No I will on shew me  Anselmo  's Tomb  Lead me o'er Bones and Skulls and mould'ring Earth  Of Human Bodies for I'll mix with them  Or wind me in the Shroud of some pale Coarse  Yet green in Earth rather than be the Bride  Of  Garcia  's more detested Bed That Thought  Exerts my Spirits and my present Fears  Are lost in dread of greater Ill Shew me  Lead me for I am bolder grown Lead me  Where I may kneel and pay my Vows again  To him to Heav'n and my  Alphonso  's Soul  Leo  I go but Heav'n can tell with what Regret  Exeunt  The Scene opening discovers a Place of Tombs One Monument fronting the View greater than the rest  Enter  Heli  Heli  I wander thro' this Maze of Monuments  Yet cannot find himHark sure 'tis the Voice  Of one complainingThere it soundsI'll follow it  Exit  Reenter  Almeria  and  Leonora  Leo  Behold the Sacred Vault within whose Womb  The poor Remains of good  Anselmo  rest  Yet fresh and unconsum'd by Time or Worms  What do I see O Heav'n either my Eyes  Are false or still the Marble Door remains  Unclos'd the Iron Grates that lead to Death  Beneath are still wide stretch'd upon their Hinge  And staring on us with unfolded Leaves  Alm  Sure 'tis the friendly Yawn of Death for me  And that dumb Mouth significant in Show  Invites me to the Bed where I alone  Shall rest shews me the Grave where Nature weary'd  And long oppres'd with Woes and bending Cares  May lay the Burden down and sink in Slumbers  Of Eternal Peace Death grim Death will fold  Me in his leaden Arms and press me close  To his cold clayie Breast My Father then  Will cease his Tyranny and  Garcia  too  Will fly my pale Deformity with loathing  My Soul enlarg'd from its vile Bonds will mount  And range the Starry Orbs and Milky Ways  Of that refulgent World where I shall swim  In liquid Light and float on Seas of Bliss  To my  Alphonso  's Soul O Joy too great  O Extasie of Thought Help me  Anselmo  Help me  Alphonso  take me reach thy Hand  To thee to thee I call to thee  Alphonso  O  Alphonso    Osmyn  ascending from the Tomb  Osm  Who calls that wretched Thing that was  Alphonso  Alm  Angels and all the Host of Heaven support me  Osm  Whence is that Voice whose Shrilness from the Grave  And growing to his dead Father's Shrowd roots up  Alphonso  Alm  Mercy and Providence O speak to it  Speak to it quickly quickly speak to me  Comfort me help me hold me hide me hide me  Leonora  in thy Bosom from the Light  And from my Eyes  Osm  Amazement and Illusion Rivet me  To Earth and nail me where I stand ye Powers  Coming forward  That motionless I may be still

Interest superior  Osm  You do not come to mock my Miseries  Zara  I do  Osm  I could at this time spare your Mirth  Zara  I know thou cou'dst but I'm not often pleas'd  And will indulge it now What Miseries  Who would not be thus happily confin'd  To be the Care of weeping Majesty  To have contending Queens at dead of Night  Forsake their Down to wake with wat'ry Eyes  And watch like Tapers o'er

repent  The base Injustice thou hast done my Love  Yes thou shalt know spite of thy past Distress  And all those Ills which thou so long hast mourn'd  Heav'n has no Rage like Love to Hatred turn'd  Nor Hell a Fury like a Woman scorn'd  Exeunt Omnes  The End of the Third Act  ACT IV SCENE I  A Room of State  Enter  Zara  and  Selim  Zara  THOU hast already rack'd me with thy Stay  Therefore require me not to ask thee twice  Reply at once to all What is concluded  Selim  Your Accusation highly has incens'd  The King and were alone enough to urge  The Fate of  Osmyn  but to that fresh News  Is since arriv'd of more revolted Troops  'Tis certain  Heli  too is fled and with him  Which breeds Amazement and Distraction some  Who bore high Offices of Weight and Trust  Both in the State and Army This confirms  The King in full Belief of all you told him  Concerning  Osmyn  's corresponding with  The Heads of those who first began the Mutiny  Wherefore a Warrant for his Death is sign'd  And Order given for Publick Execution  Zara  Ha haste thee fly prevent his Fate and mine  Find out the King tell him I have of Weight  More than his Crown t'impart e'er  Osmyn  die  Selim  It needs not for the King will strait be here  And as to your Revenge not his own Int'rest  Pretend to Sacrifice the Life of  Osmyn  Zara  What shall I say Invent contrive advise  Somewhat to blind the King and save his Life  In whom I live Spite of my Rage and Pride  I am a Woman and a Lover still  O 'tis more Grief but to suppose his Death  Than still to meet the Rigour of his Scorn  From my Despair my Anger had its Source  When he is dead I must despair for ever  For ever that's Despairit was Distrust  Before Distrust will ever be in Love  And Anger in Distrust both shortliv'd Pains  But in Despair and everduring Death  No Term no Bound but Infinite of Woe  O Torment but to think what then to bear  Not to be bornDevise the Means to shun it  Quick or by Heav'n this Dagger drinks thy Blood  Selim  My Life is yours nor wish I to preserve it  But to serve you I have already thought  Zara  Forgive my Rage I know thy Love and Truth  But say what's to be done or when or how  Shall I prevent or stop th' approaching Danger  Selim  You must still seem most resolute and fix'd  On  Osmyn  's Death too quick a Change of Mercy  Might breed Suspicion of the Cause Advise  That Execution may be done in private  Zara  On what Pretence  Selim  Your own Request's enough  However for a Colour tell him you  Have Cause to fear his Guards may be corrupted  And some of them bought off to  Osmyn  's Int'rest  Who at the Place of Execution will  Attempt to force his way for an Escape  The State of things will countenance all Suspicions  Then offer to the King to have him strangl'd  In secret by your Mutes and get an Order  That none but Mutes may have Admittance to him  I can no more the King is here Obtain  This Grantand I'll acquaint you with the rest  Enter King  Gonsalez Garcia Perez  King  Bear to the Dungeon those Rebellious Slaves  Th'ignoble Currs that yelp to fill the Cry  And spend their Mouths in barking Tyranny  But for their Leaders  Sancho  and  Ramirez  Let'em be led away to present Death  Perez  see it perform'd  Gons  Might I presume  Their Execution better were deferr'd  'Till  Osmyn  die Mean time we may learn more  Of this Conspiracy  King  Then be it so  Stay Soldier they shall suffer with the  Moor  Are none return'd of those who follow'd  Heli  Gons  None Sir Some Papers have been since discover'd  In  Roderigo  's House who fled with him  Which seem to intimate as if  Alphonso  Still alive were arming in  Valentia  Which wears indeed this Colour of a Truth  They who are fled have that Way bent their Course  Of the same Nature divers Notes have been  Dispers'd t'amuze the People whereupon  Some ready of Belief have rais'd this Rumour  That being sav'd upon the Coast of  Africk  He there disclos'd himself to  Albucacim  And by a secret Compact made with him  Open'd the way to this Invasion  While he himself returning to  Valentia  In private undertook to raise this Tumult  Zara  Ha hear'st thou that Is  Osmyn  then  Alphonso  O Heav'n a thousand things occur  To my Remembrance now that make it plain  O certain Death for him as sure Despair  For me if it be knownIf not what Hope  Have I Yet 'twere the lowest Baseness now  To yield him upNo I will still conceal him  And try the Force of yet more Obligations  Gons  'Tis not impossible Yet it may be  That some Impostor has usurp'd his Name  Your beauteous Captive  Zara  can inform  If such a one so 'scaping was receiv'd  At any time in  Albucacim  's Court  King  Pardon fair Excellence this long Neglect  An unforeseen unwelcome Hour of Business  Has thrust between us and our while of Love  But wearing now apace with ebbing Sand  Will quickly waste and give again the Day  Zara  You're too secure The Danger is more imminent  Than your high Courage suffers you to see  While  Osmyn  lives you are not safe  King  His Doom  Is pass'd if you revoke it not he dies  Zara  'Tis well By what I heard upon your Entrance  I find I can unfold what yet concerns  You more One that did call himself  Alphonso  Was cast upon my Coast as is reported  And oft had private Conference with the King  To what Effect I knew not then But that  Alphonso  privately departed just  About the time our Arms embark'd for  Spain  What I know more is That a tripple League  Of strictest Friendship was profess'd between  Alphonso Heli  and the Traitor  Osmyn  King  Publick Report is ratify'd in this  Zara  And  Osmyn  's Death requir'd of strong necessity  King  Give Order strait that all the Pris'ners die  We will our self behold the Execution  Zara  Forbear a Moment somewhat more I  ave  Worthy your private Ear and this your Ministe  King  Let all else 'void the Room  Garcia  give Order  For doubling all our Guards command that our  Militia are in Arms We will anon  Ride forth and view the Order of our Troops  Exeunt  Garcia Perez  and Attendants  Zara  I am your Captive and you've us'd me nobly  And in return of that tho' otherwise  Your Enemy I have discover'd  Osmyn  His private Practice and Conspiracy  Against your State And fully to discharge  My self of what I've undertaken now  I think it fit to tell you that your Guards  Are tainted some among 'em have resolv'd  To rescue  Osmyn  at the Place of Death  King  Is Treason then so near us as our Guards  Zara  Most certain tho' my Knowledge is not yet  So ripe to point at the particular Men  King  What's to be done  Zara  That too I will advise  I have remaining in my Train some Mutes  A Present once from the  Sultana  Queen  In the  Grand Signior  's Court These from their Infancy  Are practis'd in the Trade of Death and shall  As there the Custom is in private strangle  Osmyn  Gons  My Lord the Queen advises well  King  What Off'ring or what Recompence remains  In me that can be worthy of so great Services  To cast beneath your Feet the Crown you've sav'd  Though on the Head that wears it were too little  Zara  Of that hereafter but mean time 'tis fit  You order none may have Admittance to  The Pris'ner but such Messengers as I  Shall send  King  Who waits there  Enter  Perez  On your Life take heed  That only  Zara  's Mutes or such who bring  Her Warrant have Admittance to the  Moor  Zara  They and no other not the Princess self  Perez  Your Majesty shall be obey'd  King  Retire  Ex  Perez  Gons  That Interdiction so particular  Pronounc'd with Vehemence against the Princess  Should have more Meaning than appears barefac'd  The King is blin  d by his Love and heeds  It not Your Majesty sure might have spared  That last Restraint you hardly can suspect  The Princess is Confederate with the  Moor  Zara  I've heard her Charity did once extend  So far to visit him at his Request  Gons  Ha  King  How she visit  Osmyn  What my Daughter  Selim  Madam take heed or you have ruin'd all  Zara  And after did sollicite you on his  Behalf  King  Never You have been misinform'd  Zara  Indeed Then 'twas a Whisper spread by some  Who wish'd it so a common Art in Courts  I will retire and instantly prepare  Instruction for my Ministers of Death  Exeunt  Zara  and  Selim  Gons  There's somewhat yet of Mystery in this  Her Words and Actions are obscure and double  Sometimes concur and sometimes disagree  I like it not  King  What dost thou think  Gonsalez  Are we not much indebted to this Fair one  Gons  I am a little slow of Credit Sir  In the Sincerity of Womens Actions  Methinks this Lady's Hatred to the  Moor  Disquiets her too much which makes it seem  As if she'd rather that she did not hate him  I wish her Mutes are meant to be employ'd  As she pretendsI doubt it nowYour Guards  Corrupted how by whom who told her so  I'th' Evening  Osmyn  was to die at Midnight  She begg'd the Royal Signet to release him  I'th' Morning he must die again e'er Noon  Her Mutes alone must Strangle him or he'll  Escape This put together suits not well  King  Yet that there's Truth in what she has discover'd  Is manifest from every Circumstance  This Tumult and the Lords who fled with  Heli  Are Confirmationthat  Alphonso  lives  Agrees expresly too with her Report  Gons  I grant it Sir and doubt not but in Rage  Of Jealousie she has discover'd what  She now repents It may be I'm deceiv'd  But why that needless Caution of the Princess  What if she had seen  Osmyn  though 'twere strange  But if she had what was't to her unless  She fear'd her stronger Charms might cause the  Moor  's  Affection to revolt  King  I thank thee Friend  There's Reason in thy Doubt and I am warn'd  But think'st thou that my Daughter saw this  Moor  Gons  If  Osmyn  be as  Zara  has related  Alphonso  's Friend 'tis not impossible  But she might wish on his Account to see him  King  Say'st thou by Heav'n thou hast arouz'd a Thought  That like a sudden Earthquake shakes my Frame  Confusion then my Daughter's an Accomplice  And plots in private with this hellish  Moor  Gons  That were too hard a Thoughtbut see she comes  'Twere not amiss to question her a little  And try howe'er if I've divin'd aright  If what I fear be true she'll be concern'd  For  Osmyn  's Death as he's  Alphonso  's Friend  Urge that to try if she'll sollicite for him  Enter  Almeria  and  Leonora  King  Your coming has prevented me  Almeria  I had determin'd to have sent for you  Let your Attendant be dismiss'd I have  Exit  Leonora  To talk with you Come near why dost thou shake  What mean those swollen and

Cause  And look thou answer me with Truth for know  I am not unacquainted with thy Falshood  Why art thou mute base and degenerate Maid  Gons  Dear Madam speak or you'll incense the King  Alm  What is't to speak or wherefore should I speak  What mean these Tears but Grief unutterable  King  Yes Guilt they are the dumb Confessions of  Thy guilty Mind and say thou wert Confed'rate  With damn'd Conspirators to take my Life  O impious Parricide now canst thou speak  Alm  O Earth behold I kneel upon thy Bosom  And bend my flowing Eyes to stream upon  Thy Face imploring thee that thou wilt

Gons  O my Son from the blind Dotage  Of a Father's Fondness these Ills arose  For thee I've been ambitious base and bloody  For thee I've plung'd into this Sea of Sin  Stemming the Tide with one weak Hand and bearing  With the other the Crown to wreath thy Brow  Whose Weight has sunk me e'er I reach'd the Shoar  Gar  Fatal Ambition Hark the Foe is enter'd  Shout  The Shrilness of that Shout speaks 'em at hand  We have no time to search into the Cause  Of this surprizing and most fatal Error  What's to be done The King's Death known will strike  The few remaining Soldiers with Despair  And make 'em yield to Mercy of the Conqueror  Alon  My Lord I've thought how to conceal the Body  Require me not to tell the Means 'till done  Lest you forbid what then you may approve  Goes in  Shout  Gons  They shout again Whate'er he means to do  'Twere fit the Soldiers were amus'd mean time  With Hopes and fed with Expectation of  The King's immediate Presence at their Head  Gar  Were it a Truth I fear 'tis now too late  But I'll omit no Care nor Haste and try  Or to repel their Force or bravely die  Exit  Gons  What hast thou done  Alonzo  Alon  Such a Deed  As but an Hour ago I'd not have done  Tho' for the Crown of Universal Empire  But what are Kings reduc'd to common Clay  Or who  wound the DeadI've from the Body  Sever'd the Head and in a Corner of  The Room dispos'd it muffled in the Mute's  Attire leaving alone to View the bloody  And undistinguishable Trunk  Which may be still mistaken by the Guards  For  Osmyn  if in seeking for the King  They chance to find it  Gons  'Twas an Act of Horror  And of a piece with this Day's dire Misdeeds  But 'tis not yet the time to ponder or  Repent Haste thee  Alonzo  hence with speed  To aid my Son I'll follow with the last  Reserve to reinforce his Arms At least  I shall make good and shelter his Retreat  Exeunt  Enter  Zara  follow'd by  Selim  and two Mutes bearing the Bowls  Zara  Silence and Solitude are ev'ry where  Thro' all the Gloomy Ways and Iron Doors  That hither lead nor Human Face nor Voice  Is seen or heard A dreadful Din was wont  To grate the Sense when enter'd here from Groans  And Howls of Slaves condemn'd from Clink of Chains  And Crash of rusty Bars and creeking Hinges  And ever and anon the Sight was dash'd  With frightful Faces and the meagre Looks  Of grim and gastly Executioners  Yet more this Stilness terrifies my Soul  Than did that Scene of complicated Horrors  It may be that the Cause and Purpose of  My Errand being chang'd from Life to Death  Has also wrought this chilling Change of Temper  Or does my Heart bode more what can it more  Than Death  Let 'em set down the Bowls and warn  Alphonso  That I am hereso You return and find  Mutes going in  The King tell him what he requir'd I've done  And wait his coming to approve the Deed  Exit  Selim  What have you seen Ha wherefore stare you thus  The Mutes return and look affrighted  With haggar'd Eyes why are your Arms across  Your heavy and desponding Heads hung down  Why is't you more than speak in these sad Signs  Give me more ample Knowledge of this Mourning  They go to the Scene which opens and shews the Body  Ha prostrate bloody headless Ostart Eyes  Split Heart burst ev'ry Vein at this dire Object  At once dissolve and flow meet Blood with Blood  Dash your encount'ring Streams with mutual Violence  'Till Surges roll and foaming Billows rise  And curl their Crimson Heads to kiss the Clouds  Rain rain ye Stars spout from your burning Orbs  Precipitated Fires and pour in Sheets  The blazing Torrent on the Tyrant's Head  Scorch and consume the curs'd perfidious King  Enter  Selim  Selim  I've sought in vain the King is no where to  Be found  Zara  Get thee to Hell and seek him there  Stabs him  His Hellish Rage had wanted Means to act  But for thy fatal and pernicious Counsel  Selim  You thought it better thenbut I'm rewarded  The Mute you sent by some Mischance was seen  And forc'd to yield your Letter with his Life  I found the dead and bloody Body stripp'd  My Tongue faulters and my Voice fails  Drink not the Poisonfor  Alphonso  is  Dies  Zara  As thou art nowAnd I shall quickly be  'Tis not that he is dead for 'twas decreed  We both should die Nor is't that I survive  I have a Remedy for that But Oh  He dy'd unknowing in my Heart  He knew I lov'd but knew not to what height  Nor that I meant to fall before his Eyes  A Martyr and a Victim to my Vows  Insensible of this last Proof he's gone  Yet Fate alone can rob his Mortal Part  Of Sense His Soul still sees and knows each Purpose  And fix'd Event of my persisting Faith  Then wherefore do I pausegive me the Bowl  A Mute kneels and gives one of the Bowls  Hover a Moment yet thou gentle Spirit  Soul of my Love and I will wait thy Flight  This to our mutual Bliss when join'd above  Drinks  O friendly Draught already in my Heart  Cold cold my Veins are Icicles and Frost  I'll creep into his Bosom lay me there  Cover us closeor I shall chill his Breast  And fright him from my ArmsSee see he slides  Still further from me look he hides his Face  I cannot feel itquite beyond my reach  O now he's gone and all is dark  Dies  The Mutes kneel and mourn over her  Enter  Almeria  and  Leonora  Alm  O let me seek him in this horrid Cell  For in the Tomb or Prison I alone  Must hope to find him  Leo  Heav'ns what dismal Scene  Of Death is this The Eunuch  Selim  slain  Alm  Shew me for I am come in search of Death  But want a Guide for Tears have dimn'd my Sight  Leo  Alas a little farther and behold  Zara  all pale and dead two frightful Men  Who seem the Murderers kneel weeping by  Feeling Remorse too late for what they've done  But O forbearlift up your Eyes no more  But haste away fly from this Fatal Place  Where Miseries are multiply'd return  And look not on for there's a Dagger that  Will stab the Sight and make your Eyes rain Blood  Alm  O I foresee that Object in my Mind  Is it at last then so is he then dead  What dead at last quite quite for ever dead  There there I see him there he lies the Blood  Yet bubbling from his WoundsO more than Savage  Had they or Hearts or Eyes that did this Deed  Could Eyes endure to guide such cruel Hands  Are not my Eyes guilty alike with theirs  That thus can gaze and yet not turn to Stone  I do not weep The Springs of Tears are dry'd  And of a sudden I am calm as if  All things were well and yet my Husband's murder'd  Yes yes I know to mourn I'll Sluce this Heart  The Source of Woe and let the Torrent loose  Those Men have left to weep and look on me  I hope they murder all on whom they look  Behold me well your bloody Hands have err'd  And wrongfully have put to Death those Innocents  I am the Sacrifice design'd to bleed  And come prepar'd to yield my Throatthey shake  Their Heads in sign of Grief and Innocence  They point at the Bowl on the Ground  And point what mean they Ha a Cup O well  I understand what Medicine has been here  O noble Thirst and yet too greedy to  Drink allO for another Draught of Death  They point at the other Cup  Ha point again 'tis there and full I hope  O thanks the liberal Hand that fill'd thee thus  I'll drink my glad Acknowledgment  Leo  O hold  For Mercy's sake upon my Kneesforbear  Alm  With Thee the kneeling World should beg in vain  Seest thou not there who prostrate lyes  And pleads against thee who shall then prevail  Yet I will take a cold and parting Leave  From his pale Lips I'll kiss him e'er I drink  Lest the rank Juice should blister on my Mouth  And stain the Colour of my last Adieu  Horror a headless Trunk nor Lips nor Face  Coming nearer the Body starts and lets fall the Cup  But spouting Veins and mangled Flesh O O  Enter  Alphonso Heli Perez  with  Garcia  Prisoner Guards and Attendants  Alph  Away stand off where is she let me fly  Save her from Death and snatch her to my Heart  Alm  Oh  Alph  Forbear my Arms alone shall hold her up  Warm her to Life and wake her into Gladness  O let me talk to thy reviving Sense  The Words of Joy and Peace warm thy cold Beauties  With the newflushing Ardour of my Cheek  Into thy Lips pour the soft trickling Balm  Of Cordial Sighs and reinspire thy Bosom  With the Breath of Love Shine awake  Almeria  Give a new Birth to thy longshaded Eyes  Then double on the Day reflected Light  Alm  Where am I Heav'n what does this Dream intend  Alph  O may'st thou never dream of less Delight  Nor ever wake to less substantial Joys  Alm  Giv'n me again from Death O all ye Pow'rs  Confirm this Miracle can I believe  My Sight against my Sight and shall I trust  That Sense which in one Instant shews him dead  And living Yes I will I've been abus'd  With Apparitions and affrighting Fantoms  This is my Lord my Life my only Husband  I have him now and we no more will part  My Father too shall have Compassion  Alph  O my Heart's Comfort 'tis not giv'n to this  Frail Life to be entirely bless'd Even now  In this extreamest Joy my Soul can taste  Yet am I dash'd to think that thou must weep  Thy Father fell where he design'd my Death  Gonsalez  and  Alonzo  both of Wounds  Expiring have with their last Breath confess'd  The just Decrees of Heav'n in turning on  Themselves their own most bloody Purposes  Nay I must grant 'tis fit you shou'd be thus  She weeps  Let 'em remove the Body from her Sight  Illfated  Zara  Ha a Cup alas  Thy Error then is plain but I were Flint  Not to o'erflow in Tribute to thy Memory  She shall be Royally Interr'd O  Garcia  Whose Virtue has renounc'd thy Father's Crimes  Seest thou how just the Hand of Heav'n has been  Let us that thro' our Innocence survive  Still in the Paths of Honour persevere  And not from past or present Ills despair  For Blessings ever wait on virtuous Deeds  And tho' a late a sure Reward succeeds  Exeunt Omnes  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs  Bracegirdle  THE Tragedy thus done I am you know  No more a Princess but  in statu quo  And now as unconcern'd this Mourning wear  As if indeed a Widow or an Heir  I've leisure now to mark your sev'ral Faces  And know each Critick by his sour Grimaces  To poison Plays I see some where they sit  Scatter'd like Ratsbane up and down the Pit  While others watch like ParishSearchers hir'd  To tell of what Disease the Play expir'd  O with what Joy they run to spread the News  Of a damn'd Poet and departed Muse  But if he 'scape with what Regret they're seiz'd  And how they're disappointed if they're pleas'd  Criticks to Plays for the same end resort  That Surgeons wait on Trials in a Court  For Innocence condemn'd they've no Respect  Provided they've a Body to dissect  As  Sussex  Men that dwell upon the Shoar  Look out when Storms arise and Billows roar  Devoutly praying with uplifted Hands  That some wellladen Ship may strike the Sands  To whose Rich Cargo they may make Pretence  And fatten on the Spoils of Providence  So Criticks throng to see a New Play split  And thrive and prosper on the Wrecks of Wit  Small Hope our Poet from these Prospects draws  And therefore to the Fair commends his Cause  Your tender Hearts to Mercy are inclin'd  With whom he hopes this Play will Favour find  Which was an Off'ring to the Sex design'd  FINIS
