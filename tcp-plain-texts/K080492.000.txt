Imperium Pelagi Saevumque Tridentem  Sed mihi sorte datum  VIRG  LONDON  Printed for T WARNER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  M DCC XXIX  BRITANNIA  A POEM  _AS on the Seabeat Shore BRITANNIA sat  Of her degenerate Sons the faded Fame  Deep in her anxious Heart revolving sad  Bare was her throbbing Bosom to the Gale  That hoarse and hollow from the bleak Surge blew  Loose flow'd her Tresses Rent her Azure Robe  Hung o'er the Deep from her Majestick Brow  She tore the Laurel and she tore the Bay  Nor ceas'd the copious Grief to bathe her Cheek  Nor ceas'd her Sobs to murmur to the Main  Peace  discontented nigh departing stretch'd  Her Dovelike Wings And  War  tho' greatly rous'd  Yet mourn'd his fetter'd Hands While thus the  Queen  Of Nations  spoke and what she said the  Muse  Recorded faithful in unbidden Verse  EVEN not you Sail that from the Skymixt Wave  Dawns on the Sight and wafts the ROYAL YOUTH  A Fraight of future Glory to my Shore  Even not the flattering View of golden Days  And rising Periods yet of bright Renown  Beneath the PARENTS and their endless Line  Thro' late revolving Time can sooth my Rage  While unchastis'd the insulting  Spaniard  dares  Infest the trading Flood full of vain War  Despise my  Navies  and my  Merchants  seize  As trusting to false Peace they fearless roam  The World of Waters wild made by the Toil  And liberal Blood of glorious Ages mine  Nor bursts my sleeping Thunder on their Head  Whence this unwonted Patience This weak Doubt  This tame Beseeching of rejected Peace  This meek Forbearance This unnative Fear  To generous  Britons  never known before  And sail'd my  Fleets  for this on  Indian  Tides  To float unactive with the veering Winds  The Mockery of War While foul Disease  And Sloth distemper'd swept off burning Crowds  For Action ardent and amid the Deep  Inglorious sunk Them in a watry Grave  There now they lie beneath the rowling Flood  Far from their Friends and Country unaveng'd  And back the weeping  WarShip  comes again  Dispirited and thin her Sons asham'd  Thus idly to review their native Shore  With not one Glory sparkling in their Eye  One Triumph on their Tongue A Passenger  The violated  Merchant  comes along  That farsought Wealth for which the noxious Gale  He drew and sweat beneath Equator Suns  By lawless Force detain'd a Force that soon  Would melt away and every Spoil resign  Were once the  British Lyon  heard to roar  Whence is it that the proud  Iberian  thus  In their own wellasserted Element  Dares rouze to Wrath the  Masters of the Main    Who told him that the big incumbent  War  Would not ere this have rowl'd his trembling Ports  In smoaky Ruin And his guilty Stores  Won by the Ravage of a butcher'd World  Yet unatton'd sunk in the swallowing Deep  Or led the glittering Prize into the  Thames    THERE was a Time Oh let my languid Sons  Resume their Spirit at the rouzing Thought  When all the Pride of  Spain  in one dread Fleet  Swell'd o'er the labring Surge like a whole Heaven  Of Clouds wideroll'd before the boundless Breeze  Gaily the splendid  Armament  along  Exultant plow'd reflecting a red Gleam  As sunk the Sun o'er all the flaming Vast  Tall gorgeous and elate drunk with the Dream  Of easy Conquest while their bloated War  Stretch'd out from Sky to Sky the gather'd Force  Of Ages held in its capacious Womb  But soon regardless of the cumbrous Pomp  My dauntless  Britons  came a gloomy Few  With Tempest black the goodly Scene deform'd  And laid their Glory waste The Bolts of Fate  Resistless thunder'd thro' their yielding Sides  Fierce o'er their Beauty blaz'd the lurid Flame  And seiz'd in horrid Grasp or shatter'd wide  Amid the mighty Waters deep they sunk  Then too from every Promontory chill  Rank Fen and Cavern where the wild Wave works  I swept confederate Winds and swell'd a Storm  Round the glad Isle snatch'd by the vengeful Blast  The scatter'd Remnants drove on the blind Shelve  And pointed Rock that marks the indented Shore  Relentless dash'd where loud the  Northern Main  Howls thro' the fractur'd  Caledonian  Isles  SUCH were the Dawnings of my liquid Reign  But since how vast it grew how absolute  Even in those troubled Times when dreadful  Blake  Aw'd angry Nations with the  British Name    Let every humbled State let  Europe  say  Sustain'd and ballanc'd by my  Naval Arm  Ah what must these immortal Spirits think  Of your poor Shifts These for their Country's Good  Who fac'd the blackest Danger knew no Fear  No mean Submission but commanded Peace  Ah how with Indignation must they burn  If ought but Joy can touch aetherial Breasts  With Shame With Grief To see their feeble Sons  Shrink from that Empire o'er the conquer'd Seas  For which their Wisdom plann'd their Councils glow'd  And their Veins bled thro' many a toiling Age  OH first of human Blessings and Supreme  Fair PEACE how lovely how delightful thou  By whose wide Tie the kindred Sons of Men  Like Brothers live in Amity combin'd  And unsuspicious Faith while honest  Toil  Gives every Joy and to those Joys a Right  Which idle barbarous  Rapine  but usurps  Pure is thy Reign when unaccurs'd by Blood  Nought save the Sweetness of indulgent Showers  Trickling distils into the vernant Glebe  Instead of mangled Carcasses sadseen  When the blythe Sheaves lie scatter'd o'er the Field  When only shining Shares the crooked Knife  And Hooks imprint the vegetable Wound  When the Land blushes with the Rose alone  The falling Fruitage and the bleeding Vine  Oh PEACE thou Source and Soul of social Life  Beneath whose calm inspiring Influence  Science  his Views inlarges  Art  refines  And swelling  Commerce  opens all her Ports  Blest be the  Man divine  who gives us Thee  Who bids the Trumpet hush his horrid Clang  Nor blow the giddy Nations into Rage  Who sheaths the murdrous Blade the deadly Gun  Into the wellpil'd Armoury returns  And every Vigour from the Work of Death  To grateful Industry converting makes  The City flourish and the Country smile  Unviolated Him the Virgin sings  And Him the smiling Mother to her Train  Of Him the Shepherd in the peaceful Dale  Chaunts and the Treasures of his Labour sure  The Husbandman of Him as at the Plow  Or Team He toils With Him the Sailor sooths  Beneath the trembling Moon the Midnight Wave  And the full City warm from Street to Street  And Shop to Shop responsive rings of Him  Nor joys one Land alone his Praise extends  Far as the Sun rolls the diffusive Day  Far as the Breeze can bear the Gifts of Peace  Till all the happy Nations catch the Song  WHAT would not PEACE the  Patriot  bear for Thee  What painful Patience What incessant Care  What mixt Anxiety What sleepless Toil  Even from the rash Protected what Reproach  For He thy Value knows thy Friendship He  To human Nature but the better thou  The richer of Delight sometimes the more  Inevitable WAR when ruffian Force  Awakes the Fury of an injur'd State  Then the good easy Man whom Reason rules  Who while unhurt knew nor Offence nor Harm  Rouz'd by bold Insult and injurious Rage  With sharp and sudden Check th' astonish'd Sons  Of Violence confounds firm as his Cause  His bolder Heart in awful Justice clad  His Eyes effulging a peculiar Fire  And as he charges thro' the prostrate War  His keen Arm teaches faithless Men no more  To dare the sacred Vengeance of the Just  AND what my thoughtless  Sons  should fire you more  Than when your wellearn'd Empire of the Deep  The least beginning Injury receives  What better Cause can call your Lightning forth  Your Thunder wake Your dearest Life demand  What better Cause than when your Country sees  The sly Destruction at her Vitals aim'd  For Oh it much imports you 'tis your All  To keep your  Trade  intire intire the Force  And Honour of your  Fleets  o'er that to watch  Even with a Hand severe and jealous Eye  In Intercourse be gentle generous just  By Wisdom polish'd and of Manners fair  But on the Sea be terrible untam'd  Inconquerable still let none escape  Who shall but aim to touch your Glory there  Is there the Man into the Lyon's Den  Who dares intrude to snatch his Young away  And is a  Briton  seiz'd and seiz'd beneath  The slumbring Terrors of a  British Fleet    Then ardent rise Oh great in Vengeance rise  O'erturn the Proud teach Rapine to restore  And as you ride sublimely round the World  Make every Vessel stoop make every State  At once their Welfare and their Duty know  This is your Glory this your Wisdom this  The native Power for which you were design'd  By  Fate  when  Fate  design'd the firmest State  That e'er was seated on the subject Sea  A State alone where LIBERTY should live  In these late Times this Evening of Mankind  When  Carthage    Rome  and  Athens  are no more  The World almost in slavish Sloth dissolv'd  For this these Rocks around your Coast were thrown  For this your Oaks peculiar harden'd shoot  Strong into sturdy Growth for this your Hearts  Swell with a sullen Courage growing still  As Danger grows and Strength and Toil for this  Are liberal pour'd o'er all the fervent Land  Then cherish this this unexpensive Power  Undangerous to the  Publick  ever prompt  By lavish  Nature  thrust into your Hand  And unencumber'd with the Bulk immense  Of Conquest whence huge Empires rose and fell  Selfcrush'd extend your Reign from Shore to Shore  Wheree'er the Wind your high Behests can blow  And fix it deep on this eternal Base  For should the sliding Fabrick once give Way  And on the Brink of Fate begin to nod  Soon blacken'd quite and past Recovery broke  It gathers  Ruin  as it rowls along  Steeprushing down to that devouring Gulph  Where many a mighty Empire buried lies  And should the big redundant Flood of  Trade    In which ten thousand thousand  Labours  join  Their several Currents 'till the boundless Tide  Rolls in a radiant Torrent o'er the Land  Fruitful of Wealth Magnificence and Joy  Of every glittering Harvest richer far  Than what  Hesperian  Gardens bore of old  Should this bright Stream the least inflected point  Its Course another Way o'er other Lands  The  various Treasure  would resistless pour  Ne'er to be won again its antient Tract  Left a vile Channel desolate and dead  With all around a miserable Waste  Not  Egypt  were her better Heaven the  Nile  Turn'd in the Pride of Flow when o'er his Rocks  And roaring Cataracts beyond the Reach  Of dizzy Vision pil'd in one wide Flash  An  Ethiopian  Deluge foams amain  Whence wond'ring  Fable  trac'd him from the Sky  Even not that Prime of Earth where Harvests croud  On untill'd Harvests all the teeming Year  If of the fat o'erflowing Culture robb'd  Were then a more uncomfortable Wild  Steril and void than of her Trade depriv'd  Britons  your boasted Isle Her Princes sunk  Her highbuilt Honour moulder'd to the Dust  Unnerv'd her Force her Spirit vanish'd quite  With rapid Wing her Riches fled away  Her unfrequented Ports alone the Sign  Of what she was her Merchants scatter'd wide  Her hollow Shops shut up and in her Streets  Her Fields Woods Markets Villages and Roads  The chearful Voice of  Labour  heard no more  OH let not then waste  Luxury  impair  That manly Soul of Toil which strings your Nerves  And your own proper Happiness creates  Oh let not the soft penetrating Plague  Creep on the freeborn Mind And working there  With the sharp Tooth of many a newform'd Want  Endless and idle all eat out the Heart  Of LIBERTY the high Conception blast  The noble Sentiment th' impatient Scorn  Of base Subjection and the swelling Wish  For general Good erazing from the Mind  While nought save narrow  Selfishness  succeeds  And low Design the gloomy Passions all  Let loose and reigning in the rankled Breast  Induc'd at last by scarceperceiv'd Degrees  Sapping the very Frame of Government  And Life a total  Dissolution  comes  Sloth Ignorance Dejection Flattery Fear  Oppression raging o'er the Waste He makes  The human Being almost quite extinct  And the whole State in broad  Corruption  sinks  Oh shun that Gulph That gaping Ruin shun  And countless Ages roll it far away  From you ye Heavenbelov'd May LIBERTY  The Light of Life the Sun of human kind  Whence  Heroes    Bards  and  Patriots  borrow Flame  Even where the keen depressive  North  descends  Still spread exalt and actuate your Powers  While slavish  Southern  Climates beam in vain  And may a  publick Spirit  from the THRONE  Where every  Virtue  sits go copious forth  Wide o'er the Land the  finer Arts  inspire  Make thoughtful  Science  raise his pensive Head  Blow the fresh  Bay  bid  Industry  rejoice  And the rough  Sons  of lowest  Labour  smile  As when profuse of Spring the loosen'd  West  Lifts up the pining Year and luscious breathes  Youth Life and Love and Beauty o'er the World  BUT haste We from these melancholly Shores  Nor to deaf Winds and Waves our fruitless Plaint  Pour out the Country claims our active Aid  That  let Us rome and where we find a Spark  Of  publick Virtue  blow it into Flame  The THRONE be chief our Care th' aetherial Streams  Of Wisdom Justice and Benevolence  That issue thence refreshing all the Land  Joyous to swell and o'er the lovely Round  Of ROYAL BEAUTY which about it glows  To hover fond prophetick of those Days  That FREDERICK dawn delightful in thy Eye  And now my  Sons  the  Sons of Freedom  meet  In awful Senate thither let us fly  Burn in the  Patriot  's Thought flow from his Tongue  In fearless Truth myself transform'd  preside    And shed the Spirit of BRITANNIA round  THIS said her fleeting Form and airy Train  Sunk in the Gale and nought but ragged Rocks  Rush'd on the broken Eye and nought was heard  But the rough Cadence of the dashing Wave  FINIS
