AT THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    THE LIFE OF  MARK AKENSIDE  MARK AKENSIDE an eminent poet and physician was born at Newcastle upon Tyne the th Nov He was second son of Mark Akenside a substantial butcher of that town his mother's name was Mary Lumsden At the freeschool of Newcastle young Akenside received the first part of his education he was next committed to the care of Mr Wilson a dissenting clergyman who kept a private academy at Newcastle  About the eighteenth year of his age our Author was sent to the university of Edinburgh in the view of qualifying himself for the duties of a Presbyterian pastor his parents and relations in general being of the Presbyterian sect Mr Akenside received some assistance from the funds which the English Dissenters employ in educating young men of no opulent fortunes but his views as to the ministry altering he bent his studies towards physick and honestly repaid to his benefactors the money they had advanced for him which being contributed for a different purpose than promoting the study of physick he thought it dishonourable to retain Whether in relinquishing his design of being a Dissenting clergyman he also ceased to be a Dissenter is not certainly known  Akenside's genius and taste for poetry displayed themselves early when at Newcastle school and during his continuance at Mr Wilson's academy His Pleasures of Imagination with several other poems  said were first written by him at Morpeth while upon a visit to his relations and before he went to the university of Edinburgh where he also distinguished himself by his poetical compositions His Ode on the Winter Solstice which is dated was certainly composed at that place  After three years study at Edinburgh Mr Akenside went to Leyden where on th May he took his degree of Doctor in Physick Same year appeared his Pleasures of Imagination a poem which procured him some emolument and much reputation This poem was followed by An Epistle to Curio an acrimonious attack on the political conduct of William Pulteney Earl of Bath whom he stigmatizes under the name of Curio as the betrayer of his country also published in the Akenside dissatisfied with this performance altered it exceedingly he converted the Epistle into an Ode and reduced it to less than half the number of lines of which it originally consisted In the he published his first Collection of Odes ten in number In came out his Ode to the Earl of Huntingdon and in he attempted to rouse the national spirit by An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England Few of his remaining  poems were published separately excepting the Ode to Thomas Edwards Esq which though written in was not printed till the year The rest of Dr Akenside's poems which appeared in his lifetime were given at least for the most part in the sixth volume of Dodsley's Collection  Soon after his return from Leyden he commenced physician at Northampton where Dr Stonehouse then practised with reputation and success Whilst here he carried on an amicable debate with Dr Doddridge concerning the opinions of the ancient philosophers with regard to a future state of rewards and punishments in which Dr Akenside supported the firm belief of Cicero in particular in this great article of natural religion Not meeting with sufficient encouragement at Northampton or being ambitious of a larger field in which to display his talents he removed to Hampstead where he resided upwards of two years and then finally fixed himself in London  At London he was well known as a poet but had still to force his way as a physician At first he had but little practice and would probably have been reduced to difficulties had not Mr Dyson his intimate friend generously allowed him  l  a year which enabled him to make a proper appearance in the world In time the Doctor acquired considerable reputation and practice and arrived at most of the honours incident to his profession he became a Fellow of the Royal  Society a Physician to St Thomas's Hospital was admitted by mandamus to the degree of Doctor in Physick in the university of Cambridge and elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London and upon the settlement of the Queen's household was appointed one of the Physicians to her Majesty He perhaps might have still rose to a greater elevation of character had not his studies ended with his life by a putrid fever d June in the th year of his age He was buried in the parish of St James's Westminster  Dr Akenside was much devoted to the study of ancient literature and was a great admirer of Plato Cicero and the best philosophers of antiquity His knowledge and taste in this respect are conspicuous in his poems and in the Notes and Illustrations which he hath annexed to them That he had a sincere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is apparent from numberless passages in his writings His high veneration for the Supreme Being his noble sentiments of the wisdom and benevolence of the Divine Providence and his zeal for the cause of virtue are conspicuous in all his poems His regard to the Christian revelation and his solicitude to have it preserved in its native purity are displayed in the Ode to the Bishop of Winchester His attachment to the cause of civil and religious liberty is a distinguished feature in the character of his poetical writings  he embraces every occasion of displaying his ardour concerning this subject and two of his Odes those to the Earl of Huntingdon and the Bishop of Winchester are directly consecrated to it  Dr Akenside is to be considered as a didactick and lyrick poet His chief work The Pleasures of Imagination was received with great applause and raised the Author's reputation high in the poetical world Pope on looking into the manuscript before publication is reported to have said  "That the Author was no everyday writer"  Mr Cooper in his Letters concerning Taste speaks of Akenside in the following strain of commendation  "For my part I am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius as this kingdom ever produced Shakespeare alone excepted By poetical genius I do not mean the mere talent of making verses but that glorious enthusiasm of soul that fine phrensy in which the poet's  eye rowling glances from heaven to earth from earth to heaven  as Shakespeare feelingly describes it This alone is poetry aught else is a mechanical art of putting syllables harmonicusly together The gentleman I mean is Dr Akenside the worthy Author of The Pleasures of Imagination the most beautiful didactick poem that ever adorned the English language"  On the other hand the late Mr Gray in a letter to Mr Wharton of Old Park near Durham dated Peterhouse th April  Mason's to edit of Gray p says  "You desire to know it seems what character the poem of your young friend Dr Akenside bears here I wonder that you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all and the rest the wiser part wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them that is Dick's and the Rainbow coffeehouses Your readier way would be to ask the ladies who keep the bars in those two theatres of criticism However to shew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen I will tell you though I have rather turned it over than read it Pleasures of Imagination but no matter no more have they that it seems to me above the middling and now and then for a little while rises even to the best particularly in description It is often obscure and even unintelligible and too much infected with the Hutchinson jargon In short its great fault is that it was published at least nine years too early And so methinks in a few words  a la mode du Temple  I have very prettily dispatched what perhaps may for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself"  "As these observations were hastily delivered in a private letter before the poem had been maturely examined we may be allowed say the writers of The Biographia to think them too severe and to  steer a middle course between Mr Gray and Mr Cooper The obscurity of The Pleasures of Imagination when read with attention will chiefly be found in the allegory of the second book which we freely confess we could never understand It might likewise have been better if the peculiar language of Hutchinson or rather of Shaftesbury had sometimes been omitted Nevertheless we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem exhibiting many bright displays of genius and fancy and holding out sublime views of Nature Providence and morality We concur with Mr Gray in thinking it was published too early the Author himself became afterwards of the same sentiment he was convinced that the poem was defective in some respects and redundant in others"  "That it wanted revision and correction"  says Mr Dyson his editor  "he was sufficiently sensible but so quick was the demand for several successive republications that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would he thought have had the appearance at least of abusing the favour of the publick he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to  give them to the publick complete and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands that despairing of ever being able to execute if sufficiently to his own satisfction he abandoned the purpose of correcting and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan"  Dr Akenside did not live to finish the whole of his plan that part of it which is carried into execution occurs next in this edition and the reader may judge of the Doctor's intentions by having recourse to the General Argument prefixed to the poem He designed at first to compromise the whole of his subject according to a new plan in four books but he afterwards changed his purpose and determined to distribute The Pleasures of Imagination into a greater number of books How far his scheme would have carried him if he had lived to complete it is uncertain for at his death he had only finished the first and second books a considerable part of the third and the introduction to the fourth The first book of the improved work bears a nearer resemblance to the first book of the former editions than any of the rest do to each other there are nevertheless in this book a great number of corrections and alterations and several considerable additions Dr Akenside has introduced a tribute of respect and affection to his friend Mr Dyson he has referred  The Pleasures of Imagination to two sources only Greatness and Beauty and not to three as he had heretofore done his delineation of beautiful objects is much enlarged and upon the whole the first book seems to have received no small degree of improvement The second book is very different from the second book of the preceeding editions the difference indeed is so great that they cannot be compared together The Author enters into a display of Truth and its three classes matter of Fact experimental or scientifical Truth and universal Truth He treats likewise of Virtue as existing in the Divine Mind of human virtue of Vice and its origin of Ridicule and of the Passions What he hath said upon the subject of ridicule is greatly and advantageously reduced from what it was in the former copies The enumeration of the different sources of ridicule is left out and consequently somelines which had given offence to Dr Warburton The allegorical Vision which heretofore constituted a principal part of the second book is likewise omitted The poetical character of the second book as it now stands is that it is correct moral and noble The third book is an episode in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief character and the design of it seems to be to shew the great influence of poetry in enforcing the cause of Liberty This part is entirely new and if it had been finished would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem It is greatly to be regretted  that Dr Akenside did not live to complete his design nevertheless we should have been sorry to have had the original poem entirely superseded Whatever may be its faults there is in it a certain brightness and brilliancy of imagination and a certain degree of enthusiasm which the Doctor did not seem to have possessed in equal vigour in the latter part of his life Years and an application to scientifick studies appear in some measure to have turned his mind from sound to things from fancy to the understanding  Dr Johnson in his life of Akenside says of this poem  "It has undoubtedly a just claim to very particular notice as an example of great felicity of genius and uncommon amplitude of acquisitions of a young mind stored with images and much exercised in combining and comparing them"  Of the altered work he adds  "He seems to have somewhat contracted his diffusion but I know not whether he has gained in closeness what he has lost in splendour"  "To The Pleasures of Imagination"  continue the authors of The Biographia  "succeed two books of Odes the first containing eighteen the second fifteen odes It was Dr Akenside's intention if he had lived to have made each book consist of twenty odes Those which had been formerly published are greatly altered and improved The Doctor's odes are not equal to the beautiful productions of  Mr Gray nor perhaps to those of one or two living writers but still there is in them a noble vein of poetry united with manly sense and applied to excellent purposes This encomium cannot be extended to the whole of the odes without exception Dr Akenside does not always preserve the dignity of the lyrick Muse he is defective in the pathetick even upon a subject which peculiarly required it and where it might have been most expected the death of his mistress we mean his Ode to the Evening Star However his Hymn to Cheerfulness and his Odes on leaving Holland on Lyrick Poetry to the Earl of Huntingdon and on Recovering from a sit of Sickness justly entitle him to a place among the principal Lyrick writers of this country"  "Of his Odes"  says Dr Johnson  "nothing favourable can be saidTo examine such compositions singly cannot be required they have doubtless brighter and darker parts but when they are once found to be generally dull all further labour may be spared for to what use can the work be criticised that will not be read"  In this diversity of opinions the reader will determine for himself  Dr Akenside's principal medical performance was His Dissertatio de Dysenteria published in which has been commended as an elegant specimen of Latinity it was twice translated into English He also wrote Observations on the Origin and Use of  the Lymphatick Vessels in Animals An Account of a Blow on the Heart and its Effects Oratio Anniversaria ex Instituto Harveii in Theatro Collegii Regalis Modicorum Londinensis habita Anno Observations on Cancers Of the Use of Ipecacuanha in Asthmas A Method of treating White Swellings of the Joints Besides these he read at the College some Practical Observations made at St Thomas's Hospital on the putrid Erysipelas which he intended forthe second volume of The Medical Transactions This paper he carried home with a design to correct it but it was not returned at the time of his death Being appointed Cronian Lecturer he chose for his subject  "The History of the Revival of Learning"  and read three lectures on it before the College but from which he soon desisted it was supposed in disgust some one of the College having objected that he had chosen a subject foreign to the institution Most of the above pieces were published in The Philosophical and Medical Transactions  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE EDITION  THIS volume contains a complete collection of the poems of the late Dr Akenside either reprinted from the original editions or faithfully published from copies which had been prepared by himself for publication  That the principal poem should appear in so disadvantageous a state may require some explanation The first publication of it was at a very early part of the Author's life that it wanted revision and correction he was sufficiently sensible but so quick was the demand for several successive republications that in any of the intervals to have completed the whole of his corrections was utterly impossible and yet to have gone on from time to time in making farther improvements in every new edition would he thought have had the appearance at least of abusing the favour of the publick he chose therefore to continue for some time reprinting it without alteration and to forbear publishing any corrections or improvements until he should be able at once to give them to the publick complete and with this view he went on for several years to review and correct his poem at leisure till at length he found the task grow so much upon his hands that despairing of ever being able to execute it sufficiently to his own satisfaction he abandoned the  purpose of correcting and resolved to write the poem over anew upon a somewhat different and an enlarged plan and in the execution of this design he had made a considerable progress What reason there may be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it will best appear from the perusal of the plan itself as stated in the General Argument and of the parts which he had executed and which are here published for the person  The Right Hon Jeremiah Dyson by whom this Advertisement was written  to whom he intrusted the disposal of his papers would have thought himself wanting as well to the service of the publick as to the fame of his friend if he had not produced as much of the work as appeared to have been prepared for publication In this light he considered the entire first and second books of which a few copies had been printed for the use only of the Author and certain friends also a very considerable part of the third book which had been transcribed in order to its being printed in the same manner and to these is added the introduction to a subsequent book which in the manuscript is called the fourth and which appears to have been composed at the time when the Author intended to comprise the whole in four books but which as he had afterwards determined to distribute the poem into more books might perhaps more properly be called the last book And this is all that is executed of  the new work which although it appeared to the editor too valuable even in its imperfect state to be withholden from the publick yet he conceives takes in by much too small a part of the original poem to supply its place and to supersede the republication of it for which reason both the poems are inserted in this Collection  Of Odes the Author had designed to make up two books consisting of twenty odes each including the several odes which he had before published at different times  The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the sixth volume of Dodsley's Miscellanies with a few corrections and the addition of some Notes To the Inscriptions taken from the same volume three new Inscriptions are added the last of which is the only instance wherein a liberty has been taken of inserting any thing in this Collection which did not appear to have been intended by the Author for publication  In the present edition a few pieces are added which are known to be genuine and which certainly are no discredit to  heir Author  among whose papers no copy of this was found but it is printed from a copy which he had many years since given to the editor  THE DESIGN  THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodly sense and the faculties of moral perception they have been called by a very general name  "The Powers of Imagination"  Like the external senses they relate to matter and motion and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite Pleasures with which we are acquainted it has naturally happened that men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recal the delightful perceptions which they afford independent of the objects which originally produced them This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts some of which as painting and sculpture directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature others as musick and poetry bring them back to remembrance by signs universally established and understood  But these arts as they grew more correct and deliberate were of course led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry which making use of language a  the instrument by which it imitates is consequently become an unlimited representative of every speci  and mode of being yet as their intention was only to express the objects of Imagination and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class they of cours  retain their original character and all the differen  Pleasures which they excite are termed in general Pleasures of Imagination  The Design of the following Poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptation of the term so that whatever our Imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry painting musick or any of the elegant arts might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained  In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the Imagination from our other faculties and in the next place to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant and which are by nature adapted to it as light is to the eyes or truth to the understanding These properties Mr Addison had reduced to the three general classes of Greatness Novelty and Beauty and into these we may analyze every object however complex which properly speaking is delightful to the imagination But such an object may also include many other sources of Pleasure and its beauty or novelty or grandeur will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence Besides which the imitative arts especially poetry owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses or truths discovered  to the understanding or illustrations of contrivance and final causes or above all the rest with circumstances proper to awaken and engage the passions it was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify th  se different species of Pleasure especially that from the passions which as it is supreme in the noblest work of human genius so being in some particulars not a little surprising gave an opportunity to enliven the didactick turn of the poem by introducing an allegory to account for the appearance  After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration or naturally warm and interest the mind a Pleasure of a very different nature that which arises from Ridicule came next to be considered As this is the foundation of the comick manner in all the arts and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is derived Here too a change of style became necessary such a one as might yet be consistent if possible with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running eithe  into the gigantick expressions of the mock heroick  the familiar and poetical raillery of professed satire  neither of which would have been proper here  The materials of all imitation being thus laid open  nothing now remained but to illustrate some particular  Pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another or from the nature of imitation itself Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds which is the foundation of metaphor and wit As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early association of our ideas and as this habit of associating is the source of many Pleasures and pains in life and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts it is therefore mentioned here and its effects described then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts and of the secondary Pleasure as it is called arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature after which the work concludes with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of Imagination and on their natural and moral usefulness in life  Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with propriety by the Author He had two models that ancient and simple one of the first Grecian poets as it is refined by Virgil in the Georgicks and the familiar epistolary way of Horace This latter has several advantages it admits of a greater variety of style it more readily engages the generality of readers as partaking more of the air of conversation and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and  more concise expression Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the publick taste is in a great measure formed to it alone Yet after all the subject before us tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm seemed rather to demand a more open pathetick and figured style This too appeared more natural as the Author's aim was not so much to give formal precepts or enter into the way of direct argumentation as by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature to enlarge and harmonize the Imagination and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion morals and civil life It is on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the Author of Nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste thus recommending them in common to our natural propensity for admiring what is beautiful and lovely The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiment  which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite direct to the subject but since they bear an obvious re+lation to it the authority of Virgil the faultless mo+del of didactick poetry will best support him in th  particular for the sentiments themselves he make  no apology  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  EPICT  apud Arrian  II  BOOK I  The Argument  THE subjet proposed difficulty of treating it poetically The ideas of the Divine Mind the origin of every quality pleasing to the Imagination The natural variety of constitution in the minds of men with its final cause The idea of a fine Imagination and the state of the mind in the enjoyment of those Pleasures which it affords All the primary Pleasures of the Imagination  from the perception of greatness or wonderfulness or beauty in objects The Pleasure from greatness with its final cause Pleasure from novelty or wondefulness with its final cause Pleasure from beauty with its final cause The connexion of beauty with truth and good applied to the conduct of life Invitation to the study of moral philosophy The different degrees of beauty in different species of objects colour shape natural concretes vegetables animals the mind  The sublime the fair the wonderful of the mind The connexion of the Imagination and the moral faculty Conclusion  WITH what attractive charms this goodly frame  Of Nature touches the consenting hearts  Of mortal men and what the pleasing stores  Which beauteous imitation thence derives  To deck the poet's or the painter's toil  My Verse unfolds Attend ye gentle Pow'rs  Of Musical delight and while I sing  Your gifts your honours dance around my strain  Thou smiling queen of ev'ry tuneful breast  Indulgent Fancy from the fruitful banks  Of Avon whence thy rosy  ingers cull  Fresh flow'rs and dews to sprinkle on the turf  Where Shakespeare lies be present and with thee  Let Fiction come upon her vagrant wings  Wafting ten thousand colours thro' the air  Which by the glances of her magick eye  She blends and shifts at will thro countless forms  Her wild creation Goddess of the Lyre  Which rules the accents of the moving sphere  Wilt thou eternal Harmony descend  And join this festive train for with thee comes  The guide the guardian of their lovely sports  Majestick Truth and where Truth deigns to come  Her sister Liberty will not be far  Be present all ye Genii who conduct  The wand'ring footsteps of the youthful bard  New to your springs and shades who touch his ear  With finer sounds who heighten to his eye  The bloom of Nature and before him turn  The gayest happiest attitude of things  Oft' have the laws of each poetick strain  The critick verse employ'd yet still unsung  Lay this prime subject tho' importing most  A Poet's name for fruitless is th' attempt  By dull obedience and by creeping toil  Obscure to conquer the severe ascent  Of high Parnassus Nature's kindling breath  Must fire the chosen genius Nature's hand  Must string his nerves and imp his eagle wings  Impatient of the painful steep to soar  High as the summit there to breathe at large  Ethereal air with bards and sages old  Immortal sons of praise These flatt'ring scenes  To this neglected labour court my song  Yet not unconscious what a doubtful task  To paint the finest features of the mind  And to most subtle and mysterious things  Give colour strength and motion But the love  Of Nature and the Muses bids explore  Thro' secret paths erewhile untrod by man  The fair poetick region to detect  Untasted springs to drink inspiring draughts  And shade my temples with unfading flow'rs  Cull'd from the laureate vale's profound recess  Where never poet gain'd a wreath before  From Heav'n my strains begin from Heav'n descends  The flame of genius to the human breast  And love and beauty and poetick joy  And inspiration Ere the radiant sun  Sprang from the east or 'mid the vault of night  The moon suspended her serener lamp  Ere mountains woods or streams adorn'd the globe  Or Wisdom taught the sons of men her lore  Then liv'd th' Almighty One then deepretir'd  In his unsathom'd essence view'd the forms  The forms eternal of created things  The radiant sun the moon's nocturnal lamp  The mountains woods and streams therowling globe  And Wisdom's mien celestial From the first  Of days on them his love divine he fix'd  His admiration till in time complete  What he admir'd and lov'd his vital smile  Unfolded into being Hence the breath  Of life informing each organick frame  Hence the green earth and wild resounding waves  Hence light and shade alternate warmth and cold  And clear autumnal skies and vernal show'rs  And all the fair variety of things  But not alike to ev'ry mortal eye  Is this great scene unveil'd for since the claims  Of social life to diff'rent labours urge  The active pow'rs of man with wise intent  The hand of Nature on peculiar minds  Imprints a diff'rent bias and to each  Decrees its province in the common toil  To some she taught the fabrick of the sphere  The changeful moon the circuit of the stars  The golden zones of heav'n to some she gave  To weigh the moment of eternal things  Of time and space and Fate's unbroken chain  And will's quick impulse others by the hand  She led o'er vales and mountains to explore  What healing virtue swells the tender veins  Of herbs and flow'rs or what the beams of morn  Draw forth distilling from the clifted rind  In balmy tears But some to higher hopes  Were destin'd some within a finer mould  She wrought and temper'd with a purer flame  To these the Sire Omnipotent unfolds  The world's harmonious volume there to read  The transcript of himself On ev'ry part  They trace the bright impressions of his hand  In earth or air the meadow's purple stores  The moon's mild radiance or the virgin's form  Blooming with rosy smiles they see portray'd  That uncreated beauty which delights  The mind supreme they also feel her charms  Enamour'd they partake th' eternal joy  For as old Memnon's image long renown'd  By fabling Nilus to the quiv'ring touch  Of Titan's ray with each repulsive string  Consenting founded thro' the warbling air  Unbidden strains ev'n so did Nature's hand  To certain species of external things  Attune the finer organs of the mind  So the glad impulse of congenial pow'rs  Or of sweet sound or fair proportion'd form  The grace of motion or the bloom of light  Thrills thro' Imagination's tender frame  From nerve to nerve all naked and alive  They catch the spreading rays till now the soul  At length discloses ev'ry tuneful spring  To that harmonious movement from without  Responsive Then the inexpressive strain  Diffuses its enchantment Fancy dreams  Of sacred fountains and Elysian groves  And vales of bliss the intellectual pow'r  Bends from his awful throne a wond'ring ear  And smiles the passions gently sooth'd away  Sink to divine repose and love and joy  Alone are waking love and joy serene  As airs that fan the summer O attend  Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch  Whose candid bosom the refining love  Of Nature warms O listen to my Song  And I will guide thee to her fav'rite walks  And teach thy solitude her voice to hear  And point her loveliest features to thy view  Know then whate'er of Nature's pregnant stores  Whate'er of mimick Art's reflected forms  With love and admiration thus inflame  The pow'rs of fancy her delighted sons  To three illustrious orders have referr'd  Three sister Graces whom the painter's hand  The poet's tongue confesses the Sublime  The Wonderful the Fair I see them dawn  I see the radiant visions where they rise  More lovely than when Lucifer displays  His beaming foreheed thro' the gates of morn  To lead the train of Phoebus and the spring  Say why was man so eminently rais'd  ℣  Say why was man  c In apologizing for the frequent negligences of the sublimest authors of Greece  "  godlike geniuses"  says Longinus  "were well assured that Nature had not intended man for a lowspirited or ignoble being but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe as before a multitude assembled at some heroick solemnity that we might be spectators of all her magnificence and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension whence it comes to pass that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human Imagination which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us Let any man cast his eye thro the whole circle of our existence and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects he will soon acknowledge for what enjoyments and pursuits we were destined Thus by the very propensity of Nature we are led to admire not little springs or shallow rivulets however clear and delicious but the Nile the Rhine the Danube and much more than all the ocean"  c  Dionys Longin de Sublim  sect xxiv  Amid the vast creation why ordain'd  Thro' life and death to dart his piercing eye  With thoughts beyond the limit of

deeds  To chase each partial purpose from his breast  And thro' the mists of passion and of sense  And thro' the tossing tide of chance and pain  To hold his course unfault'ring while the voice  Of Truth and Virtue up the steep ascent  Of Nature calls him to his high reward  Th' applauding smile of Heav'n else wherefore burns  In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope  That breathes from day to day sublimer things  And mocks possession wherefore darts the mind  With such resistless ardour to embrace  Majestick forms impatient to be free  Spurning the gross control of wilful might  Proud of the strong contention of her toils  Proud to be daring Who but rather turns  To heav'n's broad fire his unconstrained view  Than to the glimm'ring of a waxen flame  Who that from Alpine heights his lab'ring eye  Shoots round the wide horizon to survey  Nilus or Ganges rowling his bright wave  Thro' mountains plains thro' empires black with shade  And continents of sand will turn his gaze  To mark the windings of a scanty rill  That murmurs at his feet The highborn soul  Disdains to rest her heav'naspiring wing  Beneath its native quarry Tir'd of earth  And this diurnal scene she springs aloft  Thro' fields of air pursues the flying storm  Rides on the volly'd lightning thro' the heav'ns  Or yok'd with whirlwinds and the northern blast  Sweeps the long track of day Then high she soars  The blue profound and hov'ring round the Sun  Beholds him pouring the redundant stream  Of light beholds his unrelenting sway  Bend the reluctant planets to absolve  The fated rounds of time thence far effus'd  She darts her swiftness up the long career  Of devious comets thro' its burning signs  Exulting measures the perennial wheel  Of Nature and looks back on all the stars  Whose blended light as with a milky zone  Invests the orient Now amaz'd she views  The empyreal waste where happy spirits hold  ℣  The empyreal waste  c  "Ne se peutil point qu'il y a un grand espace au dela de la region des etoiles Que se soit le ciel empyree ou non toujours cet espace immense qui environne toute cette region pourra etre rempli de bonheur et de gloire Il pourra etre concu comme l'ocean ou se rendent les fleuves de toutes les creatures bienheureuses quand elles seront venues a leur perfection dans le systeme des etoiles"  Leibnitz dans la Theodicee  part I sect  Beyond this concave heav'n their calm abode  And fields of radiance whose unfading light  ℣  whose unfading light  c It was a notion of the great Mr Huygens that there may be fixed stars at such a distance from our solar system as that their light should not have had time to reach us even from the creation of the world to this day  Has travell'd the profound six thousand years  Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things  Ev'n on the barriers of the world untir'd  She meditates th' eternal depth below  Till half recoiling down the headlong steep  She plunges soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd up  In that immense of being There her hopes  Rest at the fated goal for from the birth  Of mortal man the Sovran Maker said  That not in humble nor in brief delight  Not in the fading echoes of renown  Pow'rs purple robes nor Pleasure's flow'ry lap  The soul should find enjoyment but from these  Turning disdainful to an equal good  Thro' all th' ascent of things enlarge her view  Till ev'ry bound at length should disappear  And infinite perfection close the scene  Call now to mind what high capacious pow'rs  Lie folded up in man how far beyond  The praise of mortals may th' eternal growth  Of Nature to perfection half divine  Expand the blooming soul what pity then  Should sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earth  Her tender blossom choke the streams of life  And blast her spring Far otherwise design'd  Almighty Wisdom Nature's happy cares  Th' obedient heart far otherwise incline  Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown  Strikes the quick sense and wakes each active pow'r  To brisker measures witness the neglect  Of all familiar prospects tho' beheld  ℣  the neglectOf all familiar prospects  c It is here said that in consequence of the love of novelty objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind lose that  +sect by repeated attention to them but the instance of  is opposed to this observation for there objects at first distasteful are in time rendered entirely agreeable by repeated attention  The difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider that when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by frequently recurring the mind is wholly passive and the perception involuntary but habit on the other hand generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it so that the pleasure arises here not from the object but from the mind's conscious determination of its own activity and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination  It will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all in this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways  The pleasure from habit may be merely negative The object at first gave uneasiness this uneasiness gradually wears off as the object grows familiar and the mind finding it at last entirely removed reckons its situation really pleasureable compared with what it had experienced before  The dislike conceived of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion in which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward the other extreme of fondness and attachment  Or lasly though the object itself should always continue disagreeable yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it by which means the disagreeable impression which it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated  With transport once the fond attentive gaze  Of young Astonishment the sober zeal  Of Age commenting on prodigious things  For such the bounteous providence of Heav'n  In ev'ry breast implanting this desire  ℣  this desireOf objects new and sstrange  c These two ideas are often confounded though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty being never excited by common or wellknown appearances But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause the acquisition of knowledge and enlargement of our views of Nature on this account it is natural to treat of them together  Of objects new and strange to urge us on  With unremitted labour to pursue  Those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul  In Truth's exhaustless bosom What need words  To paint its pow'r For this the daring youth  Breaks from his weeping mother's anxious arms  In foreign climes to rove the pensive sage  Heedless of sleep or midnight's harmful damp  Hangs o'er the sickly taper and untir'd  The virgin follows with enchanted step  The mazes of some wild and wondrous tale  From morn to eve unmindful of her form  Unmindful of the happy dress that stole  The wishes of the youth when ev'ry maid  With envy pin'd Hence finally by night  The village matron round the blazing hearth  Suspends the infant audience with her tales  Breathing astonishment of witching rhymes  And evil spirits of the deathbed call  Of him who robb'd the widow and devour'd  The orphan's portion of unquiet souls  Ris'n from the grave to ease the heavy guilt  Of deeds in life conceal'd of shapes that walk  At dead of night and clank their chains and wave  The torch of hell around the murd'rer's bed  At ev'ry solemn pause the crowd recoil  Gazing each other speechless and congeal'd  With shiv'ring sighs till eager for th' event  Around the beldame all erect they hang  Each trembling heart with grateful terrours quell'd  But lo disclos'd in all her smiling pomp  Where Beauty onward moving claims the verse  Her charms inspire the freely flowing verse  In thy immortal praise O form divine  Smooths her mellifluent stream Thee Beauty thee  The regal dome and thy enliv'ning ray  The mossy roofs adore thou better sun  For ever beamest on th' enchanted heart  Love and harmonious wonder and delight  Poetick Brightest progeny of Heav'n  How shall I trace thy features where select  The roseate hues to emulate thy bloom  Haste then my Song thro' Nature's wide expanse  Haste then and gather all her comeliest wealth  Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains  Whate'er the waters or the liquid air  To deck thy lovely labour Wilt thou fly  With laughing Autumn to th'Atlantick isles  And range with him th' Hesperian field and see  Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove  The branches shoot with gold where'er his step  Marks the glad soil the tender clusters grow  With purple ripeness and invest each hill  As with the blushes of an ev'ning sky  Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume  Where gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shades  The smooth Peneus from his glassy flood  Reflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene  Fair Tempe haunt belov'd of sylvan pow'rs  Of Nymphs and Fauns where in the Golden Age  They play'd in secret on the shady brink  With ancient Pan while round their choral steps  Young Hours and genial gales with constant hand  Shower'd blossoms odours shower'd ambrosial dews  And spring's Elysian bloom Her flow'ry store  To thee nor Tempe shall refuse nor watch  Of winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruits  From thy free spoil O bear then unreprov'd  Thy smiling treasures to the green recess  Where young Dione stays with sweetest airs  Entice her forth to lend her angel form  For Beauty's honour'd image Hither turn  Thy graceful footsteps hither gentle Maid  Incline thy polish'd forehead let thy eyes  Effuse the mildness of their azure dawn  And may the fanning breezes waft aside  Thy radiant locks disclosing as it bends  With airy softness from the marble neck  The cheek fairblooming and the rosy lip  Where winning Smiles and Pleasures sweet as Love  With sanctity and wisdom temp'ring blend  Their soft allurement then the pleasing force  Of Nature and her kind parental care  Worthier I'd sing then all th' enamour'd youth  With each admiring virgin to my lyre  Should throng attentive while I point on high  Where Beauty's living image like the Morn  That wakes in Zephyr's arms the blushing May  Moves onward or as Venus when she stood  Effulgent on the pearly car and smil'd  Fresh from the deep and conscious of her form  To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells  And each cerulean sister of the flood  With loud acclaim attend her o'er the waves  To seck th' Idalian bow'r Ye smiling band  Of Youths and Virgins who thro' all the maze  Of young desire with rival steps pursue  This charm of beauty if the pleasing toil  Can yield a moment's respite hither turn  Your favourable ear and trust my words  I do not mean to wake the gloomy form  Of Superstition dress'd in Wisdom's garb  To damp your tender hopes I do not mean  To bid the jealous Thund'rer fire the heav'ns  Or shapes insernal rend the groaning earth  To fright you from your joys my cheerful Song  With better omens calls you to the field  Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chase  And warm like you Then tell me for ye know  Does Beauty ever deign to dwell where health  And active use are strangers is her charm  Confest in aught whose most peculiar ends  Are lame and fruitless or did Nature mean  This pleasing call the herald of a lie  To hide the shame of discord and disease  And catch with fair hypocrisy the heart  Of idle Faith O no with better cares  Th' indulgent mother conscious how infirm  Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill  By this illustrious image in each kind  Still most illustrious where the object holds  Its native pow'rs most perfect she by this  Illumes the headstrong impulse of Desire  And sanctifies his choice The gen'rous glebe  Whose bosom smiles with verdure the clear track  Of streams delicious to the thirsty soul  The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense  And ev'ry charm of animated things  Are only pledges of a state sincere  Th' integrity and order of their frame  When all is well within and ev'ry end  Accomplish'd Thus was Beauty sent from Heav'n  The lovely ministress of Truth and Good  In this dark world for Truth and Good are one  ℣  Truth and Good are oneAnd Beauty dweils in them  c  "Do you imagine"  says Socrates to Aristippus  "that what is good is not beautiful have you not observed that these appearances always coincide Virtue for instance in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also In the characters of men we always join the two denominations together  This the Athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words    The beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that economy of parts which constitutes them good and in every circumstance of life the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed"  Xenoph Memorab Socrat  lib iii cap  This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy See  The Characteristicks  vol ii p and and vol iii p  And another ingenious author has particularly shewn that it holds in the general laws of Nature in the works of art and the conduct of the sciences  Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue  Treat i sect  As to the connexion between beauty and truth there are two opinions concerning it Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in Nature in consequence of which  "all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions and deformity in the contrary"  And this necessity being supposed the  ame with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth  But others there are who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing that indeed it was a benevolent provision in Nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once and without having to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects but that it is not impossible in a physical sense that two beings of equal capacities for truth should perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the same proportions And upon this supposition by that truth which is always connected with beauty nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend Polycietus for instance a famous ancient sculptor from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of proportions which was the rule of all succeeding artists Suppose a statue modelled according to this a man of mere natural taste upon looking at it without entering into its proportions confesses and admires its beauty whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head the neck or the hand and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workmanship to be just and true  And Beauty dwells in them and they in her  With like participation wherefore then  O Sons of Earth would ye dissolve the tie  O wherefore with a rash impetuous aim  Seek ye those flow'ry joys with which the hand  Of lavish Fancy paints each flatt'ring scene  Where Beauty seems to dwell nor once inquire  Where is the sanction of eternal truth  Or where the seal of undeceitful good  To save your search from folly Wanting these  Lo Beauty withers in your void embrace  And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toy  Did fancy mock your vows Nor let the gleam  Of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts  Be chill'd or clouded at this awful task  To learn the lore of undeceitful good  And truth eternal Tho' the pois'nous charms  Of baleful superstition guide the feet  Of servile numbers thro' a dreary way  To their abode thro' deserts thorns and mire  And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn  To muse at last amid the ghostly gloom  Of graves and hoary vaults and cloister'd cells  To walk with spectres thro' the midnight shade  And to the screaming owl's accursed song  Attune the dreadful workings of his heart  Yet be not ye dismay'd a gentler star  Your lovely search illumines From the grove  Where Wisdom talk'd with her Athenian sons  Could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath  Of Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay  Then should my pow'rful Verse at once dispel  Those monkish horrours then in light divine  Disclose th' Elysian prospect where the steps  Of those whom Nature charms thro' blooming walks  Thro' fragrant mountains and poetick streams  Amid the train of sages heroes bards  Led by their winged Genius and the choir  Of laurell'd Science and harmonious Art  Proceed exulting to th' eternal shrine  Where Truth conspic'ous with her sister twins  The undivided partners of her sway  With Good and Beauty reigns O let not us  Lull'd by luxurious Pleasure's languid strain  Or crouching to the frowns of bigot Rage  O let us not a moment pause to join  That godlike band and if the gracious pow'r  Who first awaken'd my untutor'd song  Will to my invocation breathe anew  The tuneful spirit then thro' all our paths  Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre  Be wanting whether on the rosy mead  When summer smiles to warn the melting heart  Of Luxury's allurement whether firm  Against the torrent and the stubborn hill  To urge bold Virtue's unremitted nerve  And wake the strong divinity of soul  That conquers Chance and Fate or whether struck  For sounds of triumph to proclaim her toils  Upon the lofty summit round her brow  To twine the wreath of incorruptive praise  To trace her hallow'd light thro' future worlds  And bless Heav'n's image in the heart of man  Thus with a faithful aim have we presum'd  Advent'rous to delineate Nature's form  Whether in vast majestick pomp array'd  Or drest for pleasing wonder or serene  In Beauty's rosy smile It now remains  Thro' various Being's fair proportion'd scale  To trace the rising lustre of her charms  From their first twilight shining forth at length  To full meridian splendour Of degree  The least and lowliest in th' effusive warmth  Of colours mingling with a random blaze  Doth Beauty dwell then higher in the line  And variation of determin'd shape  Where Truth's eternal measures mark the bound  Of circle cube or sphere the third ascent  Unites this vary'd symmetry of parts  With colour's bland allurement as the pearl  Shines in the concave of its azure bed  And painted shells indent their speckled wreath  Then more attractive rise the blooming forms  Thro' which the breath of Nature has infus'd  Her genial pow'r to draw with pregnant veins  Nutricious moisture from the bounteous earth  In fruit and seed prolisick thus the flow'rs  Their purple honours with the spring resume  And such the stately tree which autumn bends  With blushing treasures But more lovely still  Is Nature's charm where to the full consent  Of complicated members to the bloom  Of colour and the vital change of growth  Life's holy flame and piercing sense are giv'n  And active motion speaks the temper'd soul  So moves the bird of Juno so the steed  With rival ardour beats the dusty plain  And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy  Salute their fellows Thus doth Beauty dwell  There most conspic'ous ev'n in outward shape  Where dawns the high expression of a mind  By steps conducting our enraptur'd search  To that Eternal Origin whose pow'r  Thro' all th' unbounded symmetry of things  Like rays effulging from the parent sun  This endless mixture of her charms diffus'd  Mind mind alone bear witness Earth and Heav'nl  The living fountains in itself contains  Of beauteous and sublime here hand in hand  Sit paramount the Graces here enthron'd  Celestical Venus with divinest airs  Invites the soul to never fading joy  Look then abroad thro' Nature to the range  Of planets suns and adamantine spheres  Wheeling unshaken thro' the void immense  And speak O Man does this capacious scene  With half that kindling majesty dilate  Thy strong conception as when Brutus rose  ℣  As when Brutus rose  c Cicero himself describes this fact  "Caesare interfectostatim cruentum alte extollens M Brutus pugionem Ciceronem nominatim exclamavit atque ei recuperatam libertatem est gratulatus"  Cic Philipp  ii  Refulgent from the stroke of Caesar's fate  Amid the crowd of patriots and his arm  Aloft extending like eternal Jove  When guilt brings down the thunder call'd aloud  On Tully's name and shook his crimson steel  And bad the father of his country Hail  For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust  And Rome again is free Is aught so fair  In all the dewy landscapes of the spring  In the bright eye of Hesper or the Morn  In Nature's fairest forms is aught so fair  As virtuous friendship as the candid blush  Of him who strives with Fortune to be just  The graceful tear that streams for others' woes  Or the mild majesty of private life

elemental round behold the seeds  Of being and the energy of life  Kindling the mass with ever active flame  Then to the secrets of the working Mind  Attentive turn from dim oblivion call  Her fleet ideal band and bid them go  Break thro' time's barrier and o'ertake the hour  That saw the heav'ns created then declare  If aught were found in those external scenes  To move thy wonder now For what are all  The forms which brute unconscious matter wears  Greatness of bulk or symmetry of parts  Not reaching to the heart soon feeble grows  The superficial impulse dull their charms  And satiate soon and pall the languid eye  Not so the moral species nor the powers  Of genius and design th' ambitious Mind  There sees herself by these congenial forms  Touch'd and awaken'd with intenser act  She bends each nerve and meditates wellpleas'd  Her features in the mirror for of all  The inhabitants of earth to man alone  Creative Wisdom gave to lift his eye  To truth's eternal measures thence to frame  The sacred laws of action and of will  Discerning justice from unequal deeds  And temperance from folly But beyond  This energy of truth whose dictates bind  Assenting reason the benignant

Long they groan'd  Beneath the furies of rapacious Force  Oft' as the gloomy North with iron swarms  Tempest'ous pouring from her frozen caves  Blasted the Italian shore and swept the works  Of Liberty and Wisdom down the gulf  Of alldevouring Night As long immur'd  In noontide darkness by the glimm'ring lamp  Each Muse and each fair Science pin'd away  The sordid hours while foul Barbarian hands  Their mysteries prosan'd unstrung the lyre  And chain'd the soaring pinion down to earth  At last the Muses rose and spurn'd their bonds  ℣  At last the Muses rose  c About the age of Hugh Capet founder of the third race of French kings the poets of Provence were in high reputation a sort of strolling bards or rhapodists who went about the courts of princes and noblemen entertaining them at festivals with musick and poetry They attempted both the epick ode and satire and abounded in a wild and fantastick vein of fable partly allegorical and partly founded on traditionary legends of the Saracen wars These were the rudiments of Italian poetry But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times such as Bolardo Bernardo Tasso Ariosto  c  And wildly warbling scatter'd as they flew  Their blooming wreaths from fair Valclusa's bow'rs  ℣  Valclusa  The famous retreat of Francisco Petrarcha the father of Italian poetry and his mistress Laura a lady of Avignon  To Arno's myrtle border and the shore  ℣  Arno  The river which runs by Florence the birthplace of Dante and Boccacio  Of soft Parthenope But still the rage  ℣  Parthenope  Or Naples the birthplace of Sannazaro The great Torquato Tasso was born at Sorrento in the kingdom of Naples  Ibidthe rageOf dire Ambition  c This relates to the cruel wars among the republicks of Italy and abominable politicks of its little princes about the fifteenth century These at last in conjunction with the Papal power entirely extinguished the spirit of liberty in that country and established that abuse of the fine arts which has been since propagated over all Europe  Of dire Ambition and gigantick Pow'r  From publick aims and from the busy walk  Of civil commerce drove the bolder train  Of penetrating Science to the cells  Where studious Ease consumes the silent hour  In shadowy searches and unfruitful care  Thus from their guardians torn the tender arts  ℣  Thus from their guardians torn the tender arts  c Nor were they only losers by the separation for philosophy itself to use the words of a noble philosopher  "being thus severed by the sprightly arts and sciences must consequently grow dronish insipid pedantick useless and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world"  Insomuch that  "a gentleman"  says another excellent writer  "cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of Antiquity and their recreation after the hurry of publick affairs"  From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of Imagination and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in England within these few years It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the Revolution when Locke stood at the head of one party and Dryden of the other But the general spirit of liberty which has ever since been growing naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion gave them with the people by applying them to subjects of importance to society Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their embellishments in order even to gain audience with the publick  Of mimick fancy and harmonious joy  To priestly domination and the lust  Of lawless courts their amiable toil  For three inglorious ages have resign'd  In vain reluctant and Torquato's tongue  Was tun'd for slavish Paeans at the throne  Of tinsel Pomp and Raphael's magick hand  Effus'd its fair creation to enchant  The fond adoring herd in Latian  anes  To blind belief while on their prostrate necks  The sable tyrant plants his heel secure  But now behold the radiant era dawns  When Freedom's ample fabrick fix'd at length  For endless years on Albion's happy shore  In full proportion once more shall extend  To all the kindred pow'rs of social bliss  A common mansion a parental roof  There shall the Virtues there shall Wisdom's train  Their longlost friends rejoining as of old  Embrace the smiling family of Arts  The Muses and the Graces Then no more  Shall Vice distracting their delicious gifts  To aims abhorr'd with high distaste and scorn  Turn from their charms the philosophick eye  The patriot bosom then no more the paths  Of publick care or intellectual toil  Alone by footsteps haughty and severe  In gloomy state be trod th' harmonious Muse  And her persuasive sisters then shall plant  Their shelt'ring laurels o'er the bleak ascent  And scatter flow'rs along the rugged way  Arm'd with the lyre already have we dar'd  To pierce divine Philosophy's retreats  And teach the Muse her lore already strove  Their long divided honours to unite  While temp'ring this deep argument we sang  Of Truth and Beauty Now the same glad task  Impends now urging our ambitious toil  We hasten to recount the various springs  Of adventitious Pleasure which adjoin  Their grateful influence to the prime effect  Of objects grand or beauteous and enlarge  The complicated joy The sweets of sense  Do they not oft' with kind accession flow  To raise harmonious Fancy's native charm  So while we taste the fragrance of the rose  Glows not her blush the fairer while we view  Amid the noontide walk a limpid rill  Gush thro' the trickling herbage to the thirst  Of summer yielding the delicious draught  Of cool refreshment o'er the mossy brink  Shines not the surface clearer and the waves  With sweeter musick murmur as they flow  Nor this alone The various lot of life  Oft' from external circumstance assumes  A moment's disposition to rejoice  In those delights which at a diff'rent hour  Would pass unheeded Fair the face of spring  When rural songs and odours wake the Morn  To ev'ry eye but how much more to his  Round whom the bed of sickness long diffus'd  Its melancholy gloom how doubly fair  When first with freshborn vigour he inhales  The balmy breeze and feels the blessed sun  Warm at his bosom from the springs of life  Chasing oppressive damps and languid pain  Or shall I mention where celestial Truth  Her awful light discloses to bestow  A more majestick pomp on Beauty's frame  For man loves knowledge and the beams of truth  More welcome touch his understanding's eye  Than all the blandishments of sound his ear  Than all of taste his tongue Nor ever yet  The melting rainbow's vernaltinctur'd hues  To me have shone so pleasing as when first  The hand of Science pointed out the path  In which the sunbeams gleaming from the west  Fall on the wat'ry cloud whose darksome veil  Involves the orient and that trickling show'r  Piercing thro' ev'ry crystalline convex  Of clust'ring dewdrops to their flight oppos'd  Recoil at length where concave all behind  Th' internal surface of each glassy orb  Repels their forward passage into air  That thence direct they seek the radiant goal  From which their course began and as they strike  In diff'rent lines the gazer's obvious eye  Assume a diff'rent lustre thro' the brede  Of colours changing from the splendid rose  To the pale violet's dejected hue  Or shall we touch that kind access of joy  That springs to each fair object while we trace  Thro' all its fabrick Wisdom's artful aim  Disposing ev'ry part and gaining still  By means proportion'd her benignant end  Speak ye the pure delight whose favour'd steps  The lamp of Science thro' the jealous maze  Of Nature guides when haply you reveal  Her secret honours whether in the sky  The beauteous laws of light the central pow'rs  That wheel the pensile planets round the year  Whether in wonders of the rowling deep  Or the rich fruits of allsustaining earth  Or fineadjusted springs of life and sense  Ye scan the counsels of their Author's hand  What when to raise the meditated scene  The flame of passion thro' the struggling soul  Deepkindled shows across that sudden blaze  The object of its rapture vast of size  With fiercer colours and a night of shade  What like a storm from their capacious bed  The sounding seas o'erwhelming when the might  Of these eruptions working from the depth  Of man's strong apprehension shakes his frame  Ev'n to the base from ev'ry naked sense  Of pain or pleasure dissipating all  Opinion's feeble cov'rings and the veil  Spun from the cobweb fashion of the times  To hide the feeling heart then Nature speaks  Her genuine language and the words of men  Big with the very motion of their souls  Declare with what accumulated force  Th' impetuous nerve of passion urges on  The native weight and energy of things  Ye  more her honours where nor beauty claims  Nor shews of good the thirsty sense allure  From passion's pow'r alone our nature holds  ℣  From passion's pow'r alone  c This very mysterious kind of Pleasure which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful has been taken notice of by several authors Lucretius resolves it into selflove  "Suave mari magno"  c  lib ii  As if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety The ingenious author of the  Reflections Critiques sur la Poesie et sur la Peinture  accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and inattentive state and this joined with the moral approbation of its own temper which attends these emotions when natural and just is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epick deserved a very particular consideration in this poem  Essential Pleasure Passion's fierce illapse  Rouses the mind's whole fabrick with supplies  Of daily impulse keeps th' elastick pow'rs  Intensely poiz'd and polishes anew  By that collision all the fine machine  Else rust would rise and foulness by degrees  Incumb'ring choke at last what Heav'n design'd  For ceaseless motion and a round of toil  But say does ev'ry passion thus to man  Administer delight That name indeed  Becomes the rosy breath of Love becomes  The radiant smiles of Joy th' applauding hand  Of Admiration but the bitter show'r  That Sorrow sheds upon a brother's grave  But the dumb palsy of nocturnal Fear  Or those consuming fires that gnaw the heart  Of panting Indignation find we there  To move delightThen listen while my tongue  Th' unalter'd will of Heav'n with faithful awe  Reveals what old Harmodius wont to teach  My early age Harmodius who had

it with all the  capacious understanding and ennobled it with  magnificence of his divine imagination He has one passage  full and clear on this head that I am persuaded the reader  be pleased to see it here tho' somewhat long Addressing  self to such as are not satisfied concerning divine Provide    "The being who presides over the whole"  says he  "  posed and complicated all things for the

brought into existence that the allcomprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy existing as it does not for your sake but the cause and reason of your existence which as in the symmetry of every artificial work must of necessity con  with the general design of the artist and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless since

individual in the general system vice might be depressed and subdued and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible in this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being the internal constitution of every mind where should be its station in the universal fabrick and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence"  He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution  "as well for those who by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated into the divine virtue are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness as of those who by the most flagitious arts have risen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power and whom you therefore look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole"  Plato de Leg  x  This theory has been delivered of late especially abroad in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions whereas Plato appears very careful to preserve it and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers  "The gracious ways of Providence to learn  "Receive my sayings with a

essential idea  "so that it yet remain as it was at first perfect in beauty and will never stand  need of any correction or improvement"  There can be no room for a caution here to understand the

representations of the fancy producing false opinions concerning good and evil Inquiry into ridicule The general sources of ridicule in the minds and characters of men enumerated Final cause of the sense of ridicule The resemblance of certain aspects of inanimate things to the sensations and properties of the mind The operations of the mind in the production of the works of Imagination described The secondary Pleasure from imitation The benevolent order of the world illustrated in the arbitrary connexion of these Pleasures with the objects which excite them The nature and conduct of taste Concluding with an account of the natural and moral advantages resulting from a sensible and wellformed Imagination  WHAT wonder therefore since th' endearing ties  Of passion link the universal kind  Of man so close what wonder if to search  This common nature thro' the various change  Of sex and age and fortune and the frame  Of each peculiar draw the busy mind  With unresisted charms The spacious west  And all the teeming regions of the south  Hold not a quarry to the curious flight  Of knowledge half so tempting or so fair  As man to man nor only where the smiles  Of love invite nor only where th' applause  Of cordial honour turns th' attentive eye  On Virtue's graceful deeds for since the course  Of things external acts in diff'rent ways  On human apprehensions as the hand  Of Nature temper'd to a diff'rent frame  Peculiar minds so haply where the pow'rs  ℣  where the pow'rsOf fancy  c The influence of the Imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the Imagination directs almost all the passions and mixes with almost everycircumstance of action or pleasure Let any man even of the coldest head and soberest industry analyze the idea of what he calls his Interest he will find that it consists chiefly of certain degrees of decency beauty and order variously combined into one system the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labour hazard and selfdenial It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of Nature and the general good otherwise the Imagination by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the moral order of things  If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune it may be answered that though no man is born ambitious or a miser yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind which shall render his Imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill and entertain passions of a particular turn Some men for instance by the original frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of Nature and it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the Imagination that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroick virtue in the moral while those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colours and forms and sounds never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestick life And this is sufficient to account for the objection  Among the ancient philosophers though we have several hints concerning this influence of the Imagination upon morals among the remains of the Socratick school yet the Stoicks were the first who paid it a due attention Zeno their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the Imagination offers to the mind  Diog Laert  l vii  The Meditations of M Aurelius and The Discourses of Epictetus are full of the same sentiment insomuch that the latter makes the  or  "right management of the fancies"  the only thing for which we are accountable to Providence and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantick  Arrian  l i c and l ii c  See also  The Characteristicks  vol I from p to  where this stoical doctrine is embellished with all the elegance and graces of Plato  Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge  The images of things but paint in all  Their genuine hues the features which they wore

drawn by Fancy lovely or deform'd  Thus her report can never there be true  Where Fancy cheats the intellectual eye  With glaring colours and distorted lines  Is there a man who at the sound of death  Sees ghastly shapes of terrour conjur'd up  And black before him nought but deathbed groans  And fearful pray'rs and plunging from the brink  Of light and being down the gloomy air  An unknown depth Alas in such a mind  If no bright forms of excellence attend  The image of his country nor the pomp  Of sacred senates nor the guardian voice  Of Justice on her throne nor aught that wakes  The conscious bosom with a patriot's flame  Will not Opinion tell him that to die  Or stand the hazard is a greater ill  Than to betray his country and in act  Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live

Distends her sallying nerves and chokes her tongue  What were it but to count each crystal drop  Which Morning's dewy fingers on the blooms  Of May distil Suffice it to have said  ℣  Suffice it to have said  c By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other and examining the ridiculous in other objects we may obtain a general de    tion of it equally applicable to every species The most important circumstance of this de  ition is laid down in the lines referred to but others more minute we shall subjoin here Aristotle's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false  says he    "The ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain and not destructive to its subject"  Poet  c  For allowing it to be true as it is not that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous so that the definition does not distinguish the thing designed Nay farther even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terrour banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement and yet not feel the ridiculous because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others cannot endure to apply the name because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling and this difference among other causes has brought a good deal of confusion into this question  "That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate belonging always to the same order or class of being implying sentiment or design and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart"  To prove the several parts of this definition  "The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed"  is ridiculous for instance pompous pretensions of wisdom joined with ignorance or folly in the Socrates of Aristophanes and the ostentations of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the Thraso of Terence  "The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable"  is also ridiculous for instance the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and publick functions of his station  "The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate"  in the last mentioned instance they both exist in the objects in the instances from Aristophanes and Terence one of them is objective and real the other only  ounded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character  "The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being"  A coxcomb in fine clothes bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendour and expense of his dress A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is both in fact and in his own apprehension of a very different species  "Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design"  A column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation  And lastly  "the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart"  such as terrour pity or indignation for in that case as was observed above the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous  Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances  Where'er the pow'r of Ridicule displays  Her quaintey'd visage some incongr'ous form  Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd  Strikes on the quick observer whether Pomp  Or Praise or Beauty mix their partial claim  Where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds  Where foul Deformity are wont to dwell  Or whether these with violation loth'd  Invade resplendent Pomp's imperious mien  The charms of Beauty or the boast of Praise  Ask we for what fair end th'Almighty Sire  ℣  Ask we for what fair end  c Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the Supreme Being for bestowing it one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause Ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood It is not in abstract propositions or theorems but in actions and passions good and evil beauty and deformity that we find materials for it and all these terms are relative implying approbation or blame To ask them whether ridicule be a test of truth is in other words to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous a question that does not deserve a serious answer for it is most evident that as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of the publick it is our business if the matter be of importance to society to drag out those latent circumstances and by setting them in full view to convince the world how ridiculous the claim is and thus a double advantage is gained for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and errour of its authors And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule  But it is said the practice is dangerous and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence I answer the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us but the sense of ridicule always judges right The Socrates of Aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawntrue but it is not the character of Socrates the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom What then did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character and thus rendered the sat  doubly ridiculous in his turn No but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people And so has the reasoning of Spinoza made many Atheists he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true And if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine  In mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt  These grateful stings of laughter from disgust  Educing pleasure Wherefore but to aid  The tardy steps of Reason and at once  By this prompt impulse urge us to depress  The giddy aims of Folly Tho' the light  Of truth slow dawning on th' inquiring mind  At length unfolds thro' many a subtle tie  How these uncouth disorders end at last  In publick evil yet benignant Heav'n  Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears  To thousands conscious what a scanty pause  From labours and from care the wider lot  Of humble life affords for studious thought  To scan the maze of Nature therefore  amp'd  The glaring scenes with characters of scorn  As broad as obvious to the passing clown  As to the letter'd sage's curious eye  Such are the various aspects of the mind  Some heav'nly genius whose unclouded thoughts  Attain that secret harmony which blends  Th' ethereal spirit with its mould of clay  O teach me to reveal the grateful charm  That searchless Nature o'er the sense of man  Diffuses to behold in lifeless things  The inexpressive semblance of himself  ℣  The inexpressive semblance  c This similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetick diction  Of thought and passion mark the sable woods  That shade sublime yon' mountain's nodding

nymph amid her subject train  Moves all obsequious Whence is this effect  This kindred pow'r of such discordant things  Or flows their semblance from that mystick tone  To which the newborn mind's harmonious pow'rs  At first were strung or rather from the links  Which artful Custom twines around her frame  For when the diff'rent images of things  By Chance combin'd have struck th' attentive

men on this head one so little to be suspected to partiality in the case that he reckons it among those  avours for which he was especially thankful to the gods that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station Speaking of the beauty of universal Nature he observes that  "there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive"  when once we consider its connexion with that general order He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities and then adds  "that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal orderwill dscern many amiable things not credible to every mind but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with Nature and her works"  M Ant  iii  I lies o'er the meadow not a cloud imbibes  The setting sun's effulgence not a strain  From all the tenants of the warbling shade  Ascends but whence his bosom can partake  Fresh pleasure unreprov'd nor thence partakes  Fresh pleasure only for th' attentive mind  By this harmonious action on her pow'rs  Becomes herself harmonious wont so oft'  In outward things to meditate the charm  Of sacred order soon she seeks at home  To find a kindred order to exert  Within herself this elegance of love  This fair inspir'd delight her temper'd pow'rs  Refine at length and ev'ry passion wears  A chaster milder more attractive mien  But if to ampler prospects if to gaze  On Nature's form where negligent of all  These lesser graces she assumes the port  Of that Eternal Majesty that weigh'd  The world's foundations if to these the mind  Exalts her daring eye then mightier far  Will be the change and nobler Would the forms  Of servile custom cramp her gen'rous pow'rs  Would sordid policies the barb'rous growth  Of Ignorance and Rapine bow her down  To tame pursuits to indolence and fear  Lo she appeals to Nature to the winds  And rowling waves the sun's unweary'd course  The elements and seasons All declare  For what th' Eternal Maker has ordain'd  The pow'rs of man we feel within ourselves  His energy divine he tells the heart  He meant he made us to behold and love  What he beholds and loves the gen'ral orb  Of life and being to be great like him  Beneficent and active Thus the men  Whom Nature's works can charm with God himself  Hold converse grow familiar day by day  With his conceptions act upon his plan  And form to his the relish of their souls  END OF BOOK THIRD  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  The General Argument  THE Pleasures of the Imagination proceed either from natural objects as from a flourishing grove a clear and murmuring fountain a calm sea by moonlight or from works of art such as a noble edifice a musical tune a  a picture a poem In treating of th  se Pleasures we must begin with the former class they being original to the other and nothing more being necessary in order to explain them than a view of our natural inclination toward greatness and beauty and of those appearances in the world around us to which that inclination is adapted This is the subject of the first book of the following poem  But the Pleasures which we receive from the elegant arts from musick sculpture painting and poetry are much more various and complicated In them besides greatness and beauty or forms proper to the Imagination we find interwoven frequent representations of truth of virtue and vice of circumstances proper to move us with laughter or to encite in us pity fear and the other passions Th  se moral and intellectual objects are described in the second book to which the third properly belongs as an episode though too large to have been included in it  With the abovementioned causes of Pleasure which are universal in the course of human life and appertain to  our higher faculties many others do generally concur more limited in their operation or of an inferiour origin such are the novelty of objects the association of ideas affections of the bodily senses influences of education national habits and the like To illustrate these and from the whole to determine the character of a perfect taste is the argument of the fourth book  Hitherto the Pleasures of the Imagination belong to the human species in general but there are certain particular men whose Imagination is endowed with powers and susceptible of Pleasures which the generality of mankind never participate these are the men of genius destined by Nature to excel in one or other of the arts already mentioned It is proposed therefore in the last place to delineate that genius which in some degree appears common to them all yet with a more peculiar consideration of poetry inasmuch as poetry is the most extensive of those arts the most philosophical and the most useful  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  BOOK I  MDCCLVII  The Argument  THE subject proposed Dedication The ideas of the Supreme Being the exemplar  of all things The variety of constitution in the minds of men with its final cause The general character of a fine Imagination All the immediate Pleasures of the human Imagination proceed either from greatness or beauty in external objects The Pleasure from greatness with its final cause The natural connexion of beauty with truth  Truth is here taken not in a logical but in a mixed and popular sense or for what has been called the truth of things denoting as well their natural and regular condition as a proper estimate or judgment concerning them  and good The different orders of beauty in different objects The infinite and allcomprehending form of beauty which belongs to the Divine Mind The partial and artificial forms of beauty which belong to inferiour intellectual beings The origin and general conduct of beauty in man The subordination of local beauties to the beauty of the universe Conclusion  WITH what enchantment Nature's goodly scene  Attracts the sense of mortals how the mind  or its own eye doth objects nobler still  Prepare how men by various lessons learn  To judge of Beauty's praise what raptures fill  The breast with Fancy's native arts endow'd  And what true culture guides it to renown  My Verse unfolds Ye gods or godlike Pow'rs  Ye Guardians of the sacred task

daughter of eternal Love  Whate'er thy name or Muse or Grace ador'd  By Grecian prophets to the sons of Heav'n  Known while with deep amazement thou dost there  The perfect counsels read th' ideas old  Of thine Omniscient Father known on earth  By the still horrour and the blissful tear  With which thou seizest on the soul of man  Thou chief Poetick Spirit from the banks  Of Avon whence thy holy singers cull  Fresh flow'rs and dews to sprinkle on the turf  Where Shakespeare lies be present and with thee  Let Fiction come on her aerial wings  Wasting ten thousand colours which in sport  By the light glances of her magick eye  She blends and shifts at will thro' countless forms  Her wild creation Goddess of the Lyre  Whose awful tones control the moving sphere  Wilt thou eternal Harmony

Genii who conduct  Of youthful bards the lonely wand'ring step  New to your springs and shades who touch their ear  With finer sounds and heighten to their eye  The pomp of Nature and before them place  The fairest loftiest countenance of things  Nor thou my Dyson to the lay refuse  Thy wonted partial audience What tho' first  In years unseason'd haply ere the sports  Of childhood yet were o'er the advent rous lay  With many splendid prospects many charms  Allur'd my heart nor conscious whence they sprung  Nor heedful of their end yet serious Truth  Her empire o'er the calm sequester'd theme  Asserted soon while Falsehood's evil brood  Vice and deceitful Pleasure she at once  Excluded and my fancy's careless toil  Drew to the better cause Maturer aid  Thy friendship added in the paths of life  The busy paths my unaccustom'd feet  Preserving nor to truth's recess divine  Thro' this wide argument's unbeaten space  Withholding surer guidance while by turns  We trac'd the sages old or while the queen  Of Sciences whom manners and the mind  Acknowledge to my true companion's voice  Not unattentive o'er the wintry lamp  Inclin'd her sceptre favouring Now the Fates  Have other tasks impos'd To thee my Friend  The ministry of freedom and the faith  Of popular decrees in early youth  Not vainly they committed Me they sent  To wait on pain and silent arts to urge  Inglorious not ignoble if my cares  To such as languish on a grievous bed  Ease and the sweet forgetfulness of ill  Conciliate nor delightless if the Muse  Her shades to visit and to taste her springs  If some distinguish'd hours the bounteous Muse  Impart and grant what she and she alone  Can grant to mortals that my hand those wreaths  Of fame and honest favour which the bless'd  Wear in Elysium and which never felt  The breath of Envy or malignant tongues  That these my hand for thee and for myself  May gather Meanwhile O my faithful Friend  O early chosen ever found the same  And trusted and belov'd once more the verse  Long destin'd always obvious to thine ear  Attend indulgent so in latest years  When Time thy head with honours shall have cloth'd  Sacred to even Virtue may thy mind  Amid the calm review of seasons past  Fair offices of friendship or kind peace  Or publick zeal may then thy mind wellpleas'd  Recall these happy studies of our prime  From Heav'n my strains begin from Heav'n descends  The flame of genius to the chosen breast  And beauty with poetick wonder join'd  And inspiration Ere the rising sun  Shone o'er the deep or 'mid the vault of night  The moon her silver lamp suspended ere  The vales with springs were water'd or with groves  Of oak or pine the ancient hills were crown'd  Then the Great Spirit whom his works adore  Within his own deep essence view'd the forms  The forms eternal of created things  The radiant sun the moon's nocturnal lamp  The mountains and the streams the ample stores  Of earth of heav'n of Nature From the first  On that full scene his love divine he fix'd  His admiration till in time complete  What he admir'd and lov'd his vital pow'r  Unfolded into being Hence the breath  Of life informing each organick frame  Hence the green earth and wild resounding waves  Hence light and shade alternate warmth and cold  And bright autumnal skies and vernal show'rs  And all the fair variety of things  But not alike to ev'ry mortal eye  Is this great scene unveil'd for while the claims  Of social life to diff'rent labours urge  The active pow'rs of man with wisest care  Hath Nature on the multitude of minds  Impress'd a various bias and to each  Decreed its province in the common toil  To some she taught the fabrick of the sphere  The changeful moon the circuit of the stars  The golden zones of heav'n to some she gave  To search the story of eternal thought  Of space and time of Fate's unbroken chain  And will's quick movement others by the hand  She led o'er vales and mountains to explore  What healing virtue dwells in ev'ry vein  Of herbs or trees But some to nobler hopes  Were destin'd some within a finer mould  She wrought and temper'd with a purer flame  To these the Sire Omnipotent unfolds  In fuller aspects and with fairer lights  This picture of the world Thro' ev'ry part  They trace the lofty sketches of his hand  In earth or air the meadow's flow'ry store  The moon's mild radiance or the virgin's mien  Dress'd in attractive smiles they see portray'd  As far as mortal eyes the portrait scan  Those lineaments of beauty which delight  The mind supreme they also feel their force  Enamour'd they partake th' eternal joy  For as old Memnon's image long renown'd  Thro' fabling Egypt at the genial touch  Of morning from its inmost frame sent forth  Spontaneous musick so doth Nature's hand  To certain attributes which matter claims  Adapt the finer organs of the mind  So the glad impulse of those kindred pow'rs  Of form of colour's cheerful pomp of sound  Melodious or of motion aptly sped  Detains th' enliven'd sense till soon the soul  Feels the deep concord and assents thro' all  Her functions Then the charm by Fate prepar'd  Diffuseth its enchantment Fancy dreams  Rapt into high discourse with prophets old  And wand'ring thro' Elysium Fancy dreams  Of sacred fountains of o'ershadowing groves  Whose walks with godlike harmony resound  Fountains which Homer visits happy groves  Where Milton dwells The intellectual pow'r  On the mind's throne suspends his graver cares  And smiles the passions to divine repose  Persuaded yield and love and joy alone  Are waking love and joy such as await  An angel's meditation O attend  Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch  Whom Nature's aspect Nature's simple garb  Can thus command O listen to my Song  And I will guide thee to her blissful walks  And teach thy solitude her voice to hear  And point her gracious features to thy view  Know then whate'er of the world's ancient store  Whate'er of mimick art's reflected scenes  With love and admiration thus inspire  Attentive Fancy her delighted sons  In two illustrious orders comprehend  Selftaught From him whose rustick toil the lark  Cheers warbling to the bard whose daring thoughts  Range the full orb of being still the form  Which Fancy worships or sublime or fair  Her votaries proclaim I see them dawn  I see the radiant visions where they rise  More lovely than when Lucifer displays  His glitt'ring forehead thro' the gates of morn  To lead the train of Phoebus and the spring  Say why was man so eminently rais'd  Amid the vast creation why empower'd  Thro' life and death to dart his watchful eye  With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame  But that th' Omnipotent might send him forth  In sight of angels and immortal minds  As on an ample theatre to join  In contest with his equals who shall best  The task achieve the course of noble toils  By wisdom and by mercy preordain'd  Might send him forth the sovran good to learn  To chase each meaner purpose from his breast  And thro' the mists of passion and of sense  And thro' the pelting storms of chance and pain  To hold straight on with constant heart and eye  Still fix'd upon his everlasting palm  Th' approving smile of Heav'n Else wherefore burns  In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope  That seeks from day to day sublimer ends  Happy tho' restless why departs the soul  Wide from the track and journey of her times  To grasp the good she knows not in the field  Of things which may be in the spacious field  Of science potent arts or dreadful arms  To raise up scenes in which her own desires  Contented may repose when things which are  Pull on her temper like a twice told tale  Her temper still demanding to be free  Spurning the rude control of wilful Might  Proud of her dangers brav'd her griefs endur'd  Her strength severely prov'd To these high aims  Which reason and affection prompt in man  Not adverse nor unapt hath Nature fram'd  His bold Imagination for amid  The various forms which this full world presents  Like rivala to his choice what human breast  E'er doubts before the transient and minute  To prize the vast the stable the sublime  Who that from heights aerial sends his eye  Around a wild horizon and surveys  Indus or Ganges rolling his broad wave  Thro' mountains plains thro' spacious cities old  And regions dark with woods will turn away  To mark the path of some penurious rill  Which murm'reth at his feet Where does the Soul  Consent her soaring fancy to restrain  Which bears her up as on an eagle's wings  Destin'd for highest heav'n or which of Fate's  Tremend'ous barriers shall confine her flight  To any humbler quarry The rich earth  Cannot detain her nor the ambient air  With all its changes For a while with joy  She hovers o'er the sun and views the small  Attendant orbs beneath his sacred beam  Emerging from the deep like cluster'd isles  Whose rocky shores to the glad sailor's eye  Reflect the gleams of morning for a while  With pride she sees his firm paternal sway  Bend the reluctant planets to move each  Round its perpetual year but soon she quits  That prospect meditating lostier views  She darts advent'rous up the long career  Of comets thro' the constellations holds  Her course and now looks back on all the stars  Whose blended flames as with a milky stream  Part the blue region Empyrean tracks  Where happy souls beyond this concave heav'n  Abide she then explores whence purer light  For countless ages travels thro' th' abyss  Nor hath in sight of mortals yet arriv'd  Upon the wide creation's utmost shore  At length she stands and the dread space beyond  Contemplates half recoiling nathless down  The gloomy void astonish'd yet unquell'd  She plungeth down th' unfathomable gulf  Where God alone hath being there her hopes  Rest at the fated goal for from the birth  Of humankind the Sovran Maker said  That not in humble nor in brief delight  Not in the fleeting echoes of Renown  Pow'rs purple robes nor Pleasure's flow'ry lap  The soul should find contentment but from these  Turning disdainful to an equal good  Thro' Nature's op'ning walks enlarge her aim  Till ev'ry bound at length should disappear  And infinite perfection fill the scene  But lo where Beauty dress'd in gentler pomp  With comely steps advancing claims the verse  Her charms inspire O Beauty source of praise  Of honour ev'n to mute and lifeless things  O thou that kindlest in each human heart  Love and the wish of poets when their tongue  Would teach to other bosoms what so charms  Their own O child of Nature and the Soul  In happiest hour brought forth the doubtful garb  Of words of earthly language all too mean  Too lowly I account in which to clothe  Thy form divine for thee the mind alone  Beholds nor half thy brightness can reveal  Thro' those dim organs whose corporeal touch  O'ershadoweth thy pure essence Yet my Muse  If Fortune call thee to the task wait thou  Thy favourable seasons then while fear  And doubt are absent thro' wide Nature's bounds  Expatiate with glad step and chuse at will  Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains  Whate'er the waters or the liquid air  To manifest unblemish'd Beauty's praise  And o'er the breasts of mortals to extend  Her gracious empire Wilt thou to the isles  Atlantick to the rich Hesperian clime  Fly in the train of Autumn and look on  And learn from him while as he roves around  Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove  The branches bloom with gold where'er his foot  Imprints the soil the ripening clusters swell  Turning aside their foliage and come forth  In purple lights till ev'ry hillock glows  As with the blushes of an ev'ning sky  Or wilt thou that Thessalian landscape trace  Where slow Peneus his clear glassy tide  Draws smooth along between the winding cliffs  Of Ossa and the pathless woods unshorn  That wave o'er huge Olympus Down the stream  Look how the mountains with their double range  Embrace the vale of Tempe from each side  Ascending steep to heav'n a rocky mound  Cover'd with ivy and the laurel boughs  That crown'd young Phoebus for the Python slain  Fair Tempe on whose primrose banks the morn  Awoke most fragrant and the noon repos'd  In pomp of lights and shadows most sublime  Whose lawns whose glades ere human footsteps yet  Had trac'd an entrance were the hallow'd haunt  Of sylvan pow'rs immortal where they sat  Oft' in the Golden Age the Nymphs and Fauns  Beneath some arbour branching o'er the flood  And leaning round hung on th' instructive lips  Of hoary Pan or o'er some open dale  Danc'd in light measures to his sev'nfold pipe  While Zephyr's wanton hand along their path  Flung show'rs of painted blossoms fertile dews  And one perpetual spring But if our task  More lofty rites demand with all good vows  Then let us hasten to the rural haunt  Where young Melissa dwells nor thou refuse  The voice which calls thee from thy lov'd retreat  But hither gentle Maid thy sootsteps turn  Here to thy own unquestionable theme  O fair O graceful bend thy polish'd brow  Assenting and the gladness of thy eyes  Impart to me like morning's wished light  Seen thro' the vernal air By yonder stream  Where beech and elm along the bord'ring mead  Send forth wild melody from ev'ry bough  Together let us wander where the hills  Cover'd with fleeces to the lowing vale  Reply where tidings of content and peace  Each echo brings Lo how the western fun  O'er fields and floods o'er ev'ry living soul  Diffuseth glad repose There while I speak  Of Beauty's honours thou Melissa thou  Shalt hearken not unconscious while I tell  How first from heav'n she came how after all  The works of life the elemental scenes  The hours the seasons she had oft' explor'd  At length her fav'rite mansion and her throne  She fix'd in woman's form what pleasing ties  To virtue bind her what effectual aid  They lend each other's pow'r and how divine  Their union should some unambitious maid  To all th' enchantment of th' Idalian queen  Add sanctity and wisdom While my tongue  Prolongs the tale Melissa thou may'st feign  To wonder whence my rapture is inspir'd  But soon the smile which dawns upon thy lip  Shall tell it and the tend'rer bloom o'er all  That soft cheek springing to the marble neck  Which bends aside in vain revealing more  What it would thus keep silent and in vain  The sense of praise dissembling Then my song  Great Nature's winning arts which thus inform  With joy and love the ragged bread of man  Should sound in numbers worthy of such a theme  While all whose souls have ever felt the force  Of those enchanting p  ons to my lyre  Should throng attentive and receive once more  Their influence unobscur'd by any cloud  Of vulgar care and purer than the hand  Of Fortune can bestow nor to confirm  Their sway should awful Contemplation scorn  To join his dictate  to the genuine strain  Of Pleasure's tongue nor yet  ould Pleasure's ear  Be much averse Ye chiefly gentle band  Of Youths and Virgins who thro' many a wish  And many a fond pursuit as in some scene  Of magick bright and fleeting are allur'd  By various beauty if the pleasing toil  Can yield a moment's respite hither turn  Your favourable ear and trust my words  I do not mean on bless'd Religion's seat  Presenting Superstition's gloomy form  To dash your soothing hopes I do not mean  To bid the jealous Thund'rer fire the heav'ns  Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth  And scare you from your joys My cheerful song  With happier omens calls you to the field  Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chase  And warm like you Then tell me for ye know  Doth Beauty ever deign to dwell where use  And aptitude are strangers is her praise  Confes'd in aught whose most peculiar ends  Are lame and fruitless or did Nature mean  This pleasing call the herald of a lie  To hide the shame of discord and disease  And win each fond admirer into s  ares  Foil'd bassled No with better providence  The gen'ral Mother conscious how infirm  Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill  Thus to the choice of credulous desire  Doth objects the completest of their tribe  Distinguish and commend Yon' flow'ry bank  Cloth'd in the soft magnificence of spring  Will not the flocks approve it will they ask  The reedy fen for pasture That clear rill  Which trickleth murm'ring from the mossy rock  Yields it less wholesome bev'rage to the worn  And thirsty trav'ller than the standing pool  With muddy weeds o'ergrown Yon' ragged vine  Whose lean and sullen clusters mourn the rage  Of Eurus will the winepress or the bowl  Report of her as of the swelling grape  Which glitters thro' the tendrils like a gem  When first it meets the sun Or what are all  The various charms to life and sense adjoin'd  Are they not pledges of a state entire  Where native order reigns with ev'ry part  In health and ev'ry function well perform'd  Thus then at first was Beauty sent from heav'n  The lovely ministress of Truth and Good  In this dark world for Truth and Good are one  And Beauty dwells in them and they in her  With like participation Wherefore then  O Sons of Earth would ye dissolve the tie  O wherefore with a rash and greedy aim  Seek ye to rove thro' ev'ry flatt'ring scene  Which Beauty seems to deck nor once inquire  Where is the suffrage of eternal Truth  Or where the seal of undeceitful good  To save your search from folly Wanting these  Lo Beauty withers in your void embrace  And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toy  Did fancy mock your vows Nor yet let hope  That kindliest inmate of the youthful breast  Be hence appall'd be turn'd to coward sloth  Sitting in silence with dejected eyes  Incurious and with folded hands far less  Let scorn of wild fantastick folly's dreams  Or hatred of the bigot's savage pride  Persuade you e'er that Beauty or the love  Which waits on Beauty may not brook to hear  The sacred lore of undeceitful good  And truth eternal From the vulgar crowd  Tho' Superstition tyranness abhorr'd  The rev'rence due to this majestick pair  With threats and execration still demands  Tho' the tame wretch who asks of her the way  To their celestial dwelling she constrains  To quench or set at nought the lamp of God  Within his frame thro' many a cheerless wild  Tho' forth she leads him credulous and dark  And aw'd with dubious notion tho' at length  Haply she plunge him into cloister'd cells  And mansions unrelenting as the grave  But void of quiet there to watch the hours  Of midnight there amid the screaming owl's  Dire song with spectres or with guilty shades  To talk of pangs and everlasting wo  Yet be not ye dismay'd a gentler star  Presides o'er your adventure From the bow'r  Where Wisdom sat with her Athenian sons  Could but my happy hand intwine a wreath  Of Plato's olive with the Mantuan bay  Then for what need of cruel fear to you  To you whom godlike love can well command  Then should my pow'rful voice at once dispel  Those monkish horrours should in words divine  Relate how favour'd minds like you inspir'd  And taught their inspiration to conduct  By ruling Heav'n's decree thro' various walks  And prospects various but delightful all  Move onward while now myrtle groves appear  Now arms and radiant trophies now the rods  Of empire with the curule throne or now  The domes of Contemplation and the Muse  Led by that hope sublime whose cloudless eye  Thro' the fair toils and ornaments of earth  Discerns the nobler life reserv'd for heav'n  eat'd alike they worship round the shrine  Where Truth conspic'ous with her sistertwins  The undivided partners of her sway  With Good and Beauty reigns O let not us  By Pleasure's lying blandishments detain'd  Or crouching to the frowns of bigot Rage  O let not us one moment pause to join  That chosen band and if the gracious Pow'r  Who first awaken'd my untutor'd song  Will to my invocation grant anew  The tuneful spirit then thro' all our paths  Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre  Be wanting whether on the rosy mead  When summer smiles to warn the melting heart  Of Luxury's allurement whether firm  Against the torrent and the stubborn hill  To urge free Virtue's steps and to her side  Summon that strong divinity of soul  Which conquers Chance and Fate or on the height  The goal assign'd her haply to proclaim  Her triumph on her brow to place the crown  Of uncorrupted praise thro' future worlds  To follow her interminated way  And bless Heav'n's image in the heart of man  Such is the worth of Beauty such her pow'r  So blameless so rever'd It now remains  In just gradation thro' the various ranks  Of being to contemplate how her gifts  Rise in due measure watchful to attend  The steps of rising Nature Last and least  In colours mingling with a random blaze  Doth Beauty dwell then higher in the forms  Of simplest easiest measure in the bounds  Of circle cube or sphere the third ascent  To symmetry adds colour thus the pearl  Shines in the concave of its purple bed  And painted shells along some winding shore  Catch with indented folds the glancing sun  Next as we rise appear the blooming tribes  Which clothe the fragrant earth which draw from her  Their own nutrition which are born and die  Yet in their seed immortal such the flow'rs  With which young Maia pays the village maids  That hail her natal morn and such the groves  Which blithe Pomona rears on Vaga's bank  To seed the bowl of Ariconian swains  Who quaff beneath her branches Nobler still  Is Beauty's name where to the full consent  Of members and of features to the pride  Of colour and the vital change of growth  Life's holy flame with piercing sense is giv'n  While active motion speaks the temper'd soul  So moves the bird of Juno so the steed  With rival swiftness heats the dusty plain  And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy  Salute their fellows What sublimer pomp  Adorns the seat where Virtue dwells on earth  And Truth's eternal daylight shines around  What palm belongs to man's imperial front  And woman pow'rful with becoming smiles  Chief of terrestrial natures need we now  Strive to inculcate Thus hath Beauty there  Her most conspic'ous praise to Matter lent  Where most conspic'ous thro' that shadowy  Breaks forth the bright expression of a mind  By steps directing our enraptur'd search  To him the first of minds the chief the sole  From whom thro' this wide complicated world  Did all her various lineaments begin  To whom alone consenting and entire  At once their mutual influence all display  He God most high bear witness Earth and Heav'n  The living fountains in himself contains  Of beauteous and sublime With him inthron'd  Ere days or years trod their ethereal way  In his supreme intelligence inthron'd  The queen of Love holds her unclouded state  Urania Thee O Father this extent  Of matter thee the sluggish earth and track  Of seas the heav'ns and heav'nly splendours feel  Pervading quick'ning moving From the depth  Of thy great essence forth didst thou conduct  Eternal Form and there where Chaos reign'd  Gav'st her dominion to erect her seat  And sanctify the mansion All her works  Wellpleas'd thou didst behold the gloomy fires  Of storm or earthquake and the purest light  Of summer soft Campania's newborn rose  And the slow weed which pines on Russian hills  Comely alike to thy full vision stand  To thy surrounding vision which unites  All essences and pow'rs of the great world  In one sole order fair alike they stand  As features well consenting and alike  Requir'd by Nature ere she could attain  Her just resemblance to the perfect shape  Of universal Beauty which with thee  Dwelt from the first Thou also Ancient Mind  Whom love and free beneficence await  In all thy doings to inferiour minds  Thy offspring and to man thy youngest son  Refusing no convenient gift nor good  Their eyes didst open in this earth yon' heav'n  Those starry worlds the countenance divine  Of Beauty to behold but not to them  Didst thou her awful magnitude reveal  Such as before thine own unbounded sight  She stands for never shall created soul  Conceive that object nor to all their kinds  The same in shape or features didst thou frame  Her image Measuring well their diff'rent spheres  Of sense and action thy paternal hand  Hath for each race prepar'd a diff'rent test  Of Beauty own'd and reverenc'd as their guide  Most apt most faithful Thence inform'd they scan  The objects that surround them and select  Since the great whole disclaims their scanty view  Each for himself selects peculiar parts  Of Nature what the standard fix'd by Heav'n  Within his breast approves acquiring thus  A partial beauty which becomes his lot  A beauty which his eye may comprehend  His hand may copy leaving O Supreme  O thou whom none hath utter'd leaving all  To thee that infinite consummate form  Which the great pow'rs the gods around thy throne  And nearest to thy counsels know with thee  For ever to have been but who she is  Or what her likeness know not Man surveys  A narrower scene where by the mix'd effect  Of things corporeal on his passive mind  He judgeth what is fair Corporeal things  The mind of man impel with various pow'rs  And various features to his eye disclose  The pow'rs which move his sense with instant joy  The features which attract his heart to love  He marks combines reposits Other pow'rs  And features of the selfsame thing unless  The beauteous form the creature of his mind  Request their close alliance he o'erlooks  Forgotten or with selfbeguiling zeal  Whene'er his passions mingle in the work  Half alters half disowns The tribes of men  Thus from their diff'rent functions and the shapes  Familiar to their eye with art obtain  Unconscious of their purpose yet with art  Obtain the Beauty fitting man to love  Whose proud desires from Nature's homely toil  Oft' turn away fastidious asking still  His mind's high aid to purify the form  From matter's gross communion to secure  For ever from the meddling hand of Change  Or rude Decay her features and to add  Whatever ornaments may suit her mien  Whate'er he finds them scatter'd thro' the paths  Of Nature or of Fortune then he seats  Th' accomplish'd image deep within his breast  Reviews it and accounts it good and fair  Thus the one Beauty of the world entire  The universal Venus far beyond  The keenest effort of created eyes  And their most wide horizon dwells inthron'd  In ancient silence at her footstool stands  An altar burning with eternal fire  Unsully'd unconsum'd Here ev'ry hour  Here ev'ry moment in their turns arrive  Her offspring an innumerable band  Of sisters comely all but diff'ring far  In age in stature and expressive mien  More than bright Helen from her newborn babe  To this maternal shrine in turns they come  Each with her sacred lamp that from the source  Of living flame which here immortal slows  Their portions of its lustre they may draw  For days or months or years for ages some  As their great parent's discipline requires  Then to their sev'ral mansions they depart  In stars in planets thro' the unknown shores  Of yon' ethereal ocean Who can tell  Ev'n on the surface of this rowling earth  How many make abode The fields the groves  The winding rivers and the azure main  Are render'd solemn by their frequent feet  Their rites sublime There each her destin'd home  Informs with that pure radiance from the skies  Brought down and shines thro'out her little sphere  Exulting Straight as travellers by night  Turn toward a distant flame so some fit eye  Among the various tenants of the scene  Discerns the heav'nborn phantom seated there  And owns her charms hence the wide universe  Thro' all the seasons of revolving worlds  Bears witness with its people gods and men  To Beauty's blissful pow'r and with the voice  Of grateful admiration still resounds  That voice to which is Beauty's frame divine  As is the cunning of the master's hand  To the sweet accent of the welltun'd lyre  Genius of ancient Greece whose faithful steps  Have led us to these awful solitudes  Of Nature and of Science Nurse rever'd  Of gen'rous counsels and heroick deeds  O let some portion of thy matchless praise  Dwell in my breast and teach me to adorn  This unattempted theme Nor be my thoughts  Presumpt'ous counted if amid the calm  Which Hesper sheds along the vernal heav'n  If I from vulgar Superstition's walk  Impatient steal and from th' unseemly rites  Of splendid Adulation to attend  With hymns thy presence in the sylvan shade  By their malignant footsteps unprofan'd  Come O renowned Pow'r thy glowing mien  Such and so elevated all thy form  As when the great barbarick lord again  And yet again diminish'd hid his face  Among the herd of satraps and of kings  And at the lightning of thy lifted spear  Crouch'd like a slave Bring all thy martial spoils  Thy palms thy laurels thy triumphal songs  Thy smiling band of arts thy godlike sires  Of civil wisdom thy unconquer'd youth  After some glorious day rejoicing round  Their newerected trophy Guide my feet  Thro' fair Lyceum's walk the olive shades  Of academus and the sacred vale  Haunted by steps divine where once beneath  That everliving platane's ample boughs  Ilissus by Socratick sounds detain'd  On his neglected urn attentive lay  While Boreas ling'ring on the neighb'ring steep  With beauteous Orithyia his lovetale  In silent awe suspended there let me  With blameless hand from thy unenvious fields  Transplant some living blossoms to adorn  My native clime while far beyond the meed  Of Fancy's toil aspiring I unlock  The springs of ancient wisdom while I add  What cannot be disjoin'd from Beauty's praise  Thy name and native dress thy works belov'd  And honour'd while to my compatriot youth  I point the great example of thy sons  And tune to Attick themes the British lyre  END OF BOOK FIRST  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  BOOK II  The Argument  INTRODUCTION to this more difficult part of the subject Of truth and its three classes matter of fact experimental or scientifical truth cont  distinguished from opinion and universal truth which last is either metaphysical or geometrical either purely intellectual or perfectly a  acted On the power of discerning truth depends that of acting with the view of an end a circumstance essential to virtue Of virtue considered in the Divine Mind as a perpetual and universal beneficence Of human virtue considered as a sysem of particular sentiments and actions suitable to the design of Providence and the condition of man to whom it constitutes the chief good and the first beauty Of vice and its origin Of ridicule its general nature and final cause  Of the passions particularly of those which relate to evil natural or moral and which are generally accounted painful though not always unattended with Pleasure  THUS far of Beauty and the pleasing forms  Which man's untutor'd fancy from the scenes  Imperfect of this everchanging world  Creates and views enamour'd Now my song  Severer themes demand mysterious truth  And virtue sovran good the spells the trains  The progeny of Errour the dread sway  Of Passion and whatever hidden stores  From her own lofty deeds and from herself  The mind acquires Severer argument  Not less attractive nor deserving less  A constant ear for what are all the forms  Educ'd by fancy from corporeal things  Greatness or pomp or symmetry of parts  Not tending to the heart soon seeble grows  As the blunt arrow 'gainst the knotty trunk  Their impulse on the sense while the pall'd eye  Expects in vain its tribute asks in vain  Where are the ornaments it once admir'd  Not so the moral species nor the pow'rs  Of passion and of thought Th' ambitious mind  With objects boundless as her own desires  Can there converse by these unfading forms  Touch'd and awaken'd still with eager act  She bends each nerve and meditates wellpleas'd  Her gifts her godlike fortune Such the seenes  Now op'ning round us may the destin'd Verse  Maintain its equal tenour tho' in tracks  Obscure and ard'ous may the Source of Light  Allpresent allsufficient guide our steps  Thro' ev'ry maze and whom in childish years  From the loud throng the beaten paths of wealth  And pow'r thou didst apart send forth to speak  In tuneful words concerning highest things  Him still do thou O Father at those hours  Of pensive freedom when the human soul  Shuts out the rumour of the world him still  Touch thou with secret lessons call thou back  Each erring thought and let the yielding strains  From his full bosom like a welcome rill  Spontaneous from its healthy fountain flow  But from what name what favourable sign  What heav'nly auspice rather shall I date  My perilous excursion than from truth  That nearest inmate of the human soul  Estrang'd from whom the countenance divine  Of man dissigur'd and dishonour'd sinks  Among inferiour things for to the brutes  Perception and the transient boons of sense  Hath Fate imparted but to man alone  Of sublunary beings was it giv'n  Each fleeting impulse on the sensual pow'rs  At leisure to review with equal eye  To sean the passion of the stricken nerve  Or the vague object striking to conduct  From sense the portal turbulent and loud  Into the mind's wide palace one by one  The frequent pressing fluctuating forms  And question and compare them Thus he learns  Their birth and fortunes how ally'd they haunt  The avenues of sense what laws direct  Their union and what various discords rise  Or fix'd or casual which when his clear thought  Retains and when his faithful words express  That living image of th' external scene  As in a polish'd mirror held to view  Is truth where'er it varies from the shape  And hue of its exemplar in that part  Dim errour lurks Moreover from without  When oft' the same society of forms  In the same order have approach'd his mind  He deigns no more their steps with curious heed  To trace no more their features or their garb  He now examines but of them and their  Condition as with some diviner's tongue  Affirms what Heav'n in ev'ry distant place  Thro' ev'ry future season will decree  This too is truth where'er his prudent lips  Wait till experience diligent and flow  Has authoris'd their sentence this is truth  A second higher kind the parent this  Of Science or the losty pow'r herself  Science herself on whom the wants and cares  Of social life depend the substitute  Of God's own wisdom in this toilsome world  The providence of man Yet ost' in vain  To earn her aid with fix'd and anxious eye  He looks on Nature's and on Fortune's course  Too much in vain his duller visual ray  The stillness and the persevering acts  Of Nature oft' elude and Fortune oft'  With step fantastick from her wonted walk  Turns into mazes dim his sight is foil'd  And the crude sentence of his falt'ring tongue  Is but Opinion's verdict half believ'd  And prone to change Here thou who feelst thine ear  Congenial to my lyre's profounder tone  Pause and be watchful Hitherto the stores  Which feed thy mind and exercise her pow'rs  Partake the relish of their native soil  Their parent earth but know a nobler dow'r  Her sire at birth decreed her purer gifts  From his own treasure forms which never deign'd  In eyes or ears to dwell within the sense  Of earthly organs but sublime were plac'd  In his essential reason leading there  That vast ideal host which all his works  Thro' endless ages never will reveal  Thus then endow'd the feeble creature man  The slave of hunger and the prey of Death  Even now even here in earth's dim prison bound  The language of intelligence divine  Attains repeating oft' concerning one  And many past and present parts and whole  Those sovran dictates which in farthest heav'n  Where no orb rowls Eternity's fix'd ear  Hears from coeval truth when Chance nor Change  Nature's loud progeny nor Nature's self  Dares intermeddle or approach her throne  Ere long o'er this corporeal world he learns  T' extend her sway while calling from the deep  From earth and air their multitudes untold  Of figures and of motions round his walk  For each wide family some single birth  He sets in view th' impartial type of all  Its brethren suff'ring it to claim beyond  Their common heritage no private gift  No proper fortune Then whate'er his eye  In this discerns his bold unerring tongue  Pronounceth of the kindred without bound  Without condition Such the rise of forms  Sequester'd far from sense and ev'ry spot  Peculiar in the realms of space or time  Such is the throne which man for Truth amid  The paths of mutability hath built  Secure unshaken still and whence he views  In matter's mould'ring structures the pure forms  Of triangle or circle cube or cone  Impassive all whose attributes nor Force  Nor Fate can alter there he first conceives  True being and an intellectual world  The same this hour and ever thence he deems  Of his own lot above the painted shapes  That fleeting move o'er this terrestrial scene  Looks up beyond the adamantine gates  Of death expatiates as his birthright claims  Inheritance in all the works of God  Prepares for endless time his plan of life  And counts the universe itself his home  Whence also but from truth the light of minds  Is human fortune gladden'd with the rays  Of virtue with the moral colours thrown  On ev'ry walk of this our social scene  Adorning for the eye of gods and men  The passions actions habitudes of life  And rend'ring earth like heav'n a sacred place  Where Love and Praise may take delight to dwell  Let none with heedless tongue from Truth disjoin  The reign of Virtue Ere the dayspring flow'd  Like sisters link'd in Concord's golden chain  They stood before the great Eternal Mind  Their common parent and by him were both  Sent forth among his creatures hand in hand  Inseparably join'd nor e'er did Truth  Find an apt ear to listen to her lore  Which knew not Virtue's voice nor save where Truth's  Majestick words are heard and understood  Doth Virtue deign t' inhabit Go inquire  Of Nature not among Tartarean rocks  Whither the hungry vulture with its prey  Returns not where the lion's sullen roar  At noon resounds along the lonely banks  Of ancient Tigris but her gentler scenes  The dovecote and the shepherd's fold at morn  Consult or by the meadow's fragrant hedge  In springtime when the woodlands first are green  Attend the linnet singing to his mate  Couch'd o'er their tender young To this fond care  Thou dost not Virtue's honourable name  Attribute wherefore save that not one gleam  Of truth did e'er discover to themselves  Their little hearts or teach them by th' effects  Of that parental love the love itself  To judge and measure its officious deeds  But man whose eyelids Truth has fill'd with day  Discerns how skilfully to bounteous ends  His wise affections move with free accord  Adopts their guidance yields himself secure  To Nature's prudent impulse and converts  Instinct to duty and to sacred law  Hence right and fit on earth while thus to man  Th' Almighty Legislator hath explain'd  The springs of action fix'd within his breast  Hath giv'n him pow'r to slacken or restrain  Their effort and hath shewn him how they join  Their partial movements with the masterwheel  Of the great world and serve that sacred end  Which he th' Unerring Reason keeps in view  For if a mortal tongue may speak of him  And his dread ways ev'n as his boundless eye  Connecting ev'ry form and ev'ry change  Beholds the perfect beauty so his will  Thro' ev'ry hour producing good to all  The family of creatures is itself  The perfect virtue Let the grateful swain  Remember this as oft' with joy and praise  He looks upon the falling dews which clothe  His lawns with verdure and the tender seed  Nourish within his surrows when between  Dead seas and burning skies where long unmov'd  The bark had languish'd now a rustling gale  Lifts o'er the fickle waves the dancing prow  Let the glad pilot bursting out in thanks  Remember this lest blind o'erweening pride  Pollute their off'rings lest their selfish heart  Say to the heav'nly Ruler "At our call  "Relents thy pow'r by us thy arm is mov'd"  Fools who of God as of each other deem  Who his invariable acts deduce  From sudden counsels transient as their own  No  farther of his bounty than th' event  Which haply meets their loud and eager pray'r  Acknowledge nor beyond the drop minute  Which haply they have tasted heed the source  That flows for all the fountain of his love  Which from the summit where he sits inthron'd  Pours health and joy un  ailing streams thro'out  The spacious region flourishing in view  The goodly work of his eternal day  His own fair universe on which alone  His counsels  ix and whence alone his will  Assumes her strong direction Such is now  His sovran purpose such it was before  All multitude of years for his right arm  Was never idle his bestowing love  Knew no beginning was not as a change  Of mood that woke at last and started up  After a deep and solitary sloth  Of boundless ages no he now is good  He ever was The feet of hoary Time  Thro' their eternal course have travell'd o'er  No speechless lifeless desert but thro' scenes  Cheerful with bounty still among a pomp  Of worlds for gladness round the Maker's throne  Loud shouting or in many dialects  Of hope and filial trust imploring thence  The fortunes of their people where so fix'd  Were all the dates of being so dispos'd  To ev'ry living soul of ev'ry kind  The field of motion and the hour of rest  That each the gen'ral happiness might serve  And by the discipline of laws divine  Convinc'd of folly or chastiz'd from guilt  Each might at length be happy What remains  Shall be like what is pass'd but fairer still  And still increasing in the godlike gifts  Of life and truth The same paternal hand  From the mute shellfish gasping on the shore  To men to angels to celestial minds  Will ever lead the generations on  Thro' higher scenes of being while supply'd  From day to day by his enliv'ning breath  Inferiour orders in succession rise  To fill the void below As flame ascends  As vapours to the earth in show'rs return  As the pois'd ocean tow'rd th' attracting moon  Swells and the ever list'ning planets charm'd  By the sun's call their onward pace incline  So all things which have life aspire to God  Exhaustless fount of intellectual day  Centre of souls Nor doth the mast'ring voice  Of Nature cease within to prompt aright  Their steps nor is the care of Heav'n withheld  From sending to the toil external aid  That in their stations all may persevere  To climb th' ascent of being and approach  For ever nearer to the life divine  But this eternal fabrick was not rais'd  For man's inspection Tho' to some be giv'n  To catch a transient visionary glimpse  Of that majestick scene which boundless pow'r  Prepares for perfect goodness yet in vain  Would human life her faculties expand  T' imbosom such an object nor could e'er  Virtue or praise have touch'd the hearts of men  Had not the Sovran Guide thro' ev'ry stage  Of this their various journey pointed out  New hopes new toils which to their humble sphere  Of sight and strength might such importance hold  As doth the wide creation to his own  Hence all the little charities of life  With all their duties hence that fav'rite palm  Of human will when duty is suffic'd  And still the lib'ral soul in ampler deeds  Would manifest herself that sacred sign  Of her rever'd affinity to him  Whose bounties are his own to whom none said  "Create the wisest fullest fairest world  "And make its offspring happy" who intent  Some likeness of himself among his works  To view hath pour'd into the human breast  A ray of knowledge and of love which guides  Earth's feeble race to act their Maker's part  Selfjudging selfoblig'd while from before  That godlike function the gigantick pow'r  Necessity tho' wont to curb the force  Of Chaos and the savage elements  Retires abash'd as from a scene too high  For her brute tyranny and with her bears  Her scorn'd followers Terrour and base Awe  Who blinds herself and that illsuited pair  Obedience link'd with Hatred Then the soul  Arises in her strength and looking round  Her busy sphere whatever work she views  Whatever counsel bearing any trace  Of her Creator's likeness whether apt  To aid her fellows or preserve herself  In her superiour functions unimpair'd  Thither she turns exulting that she claims  As her peculiar good on that thro' all  The fickle seasons of the day she looks  With rev'rence still to that as to a sence  Against affliction and the darts of pain  Her drooping hopes repair and once oppos'd  To that all other pleasure other wealth  Vile as the dross upon the molten gold  Appears and loathsome as the briny sea  To him who languishes with thirst and sighs  For some known fountain pure For what can strive  With virtue which of Nature's regions vast  Can in so many forms produce to sight  Such pow'rful beauty beauty which the eye  Of Hatred cannot look upon secure  Which Envy's self contemplates and is turn'd  Ere long to tenderness to infant smiles  Or tears of humblest love Is aught so fair  In all the dewy landscapes of the spring  The summer's noontide groves the purple eve  At harvesthome or in the frosty moon  Glitt'ring on some smooth sea is aught so fair  As virtuous friendship as the honour'd roof  Whither from highest heav'n immortal Love  His torch ethereal and his golden bow  Propitious brings and there a temple holds  To whose unspotted service gladly vow'd  The social band of parent brother child  With smiles and sweet discourse and gentle deeds  Adore his pow'r What gift of richest clime  E'er drew such eager eyes or prompted such  Deep wishes as the zeal that snatcheth back  From Slander's pois'nous tooth a foe's renown  Or crosseth danger in his lion walk  A rival's life to rescue as the young  Athenian warriour sitting down in bonds  That his great father's body might not want  A peaceful humble tomb the Roman wife  Teaching her lord how harmless was the wound  Of death how impotent the tyrant's rage  Who nothing more could threaten to afflict  Their faithful love Or is there in th' abyss  Is there among the adamantine spheres  Wheeling unshaken thro' the boundless void  Aught that with half such majesty can fill  The human bosom as when Brutus rose  Refulgent from the stroke of Caesar's sate  Amid the crowd of patriots and his arm  Aloft extending like eternal Jove  When guilt brings down the thunder call'd aloud  On Tully's name and shook the crimson sword  Of justice in his rapt astonish'd eye  And bad the father of his country Hail  For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust  And Rome again is free Thus thro' the paths  Of human life in various pomp array'd  Walks the wise daughter of the Judge of Heav'n  Fair Virtue from her Father's throne supreme  Sent down to utter laws such as on earth  Most apt he knew most pow'rful to promote  The weal of all his works the gracious end  Of his dread empire And tho' haply man's  Obscurer sight so far beyond himself  And the brief labours of his little home  Extends not yet by the bright presence won  Of this divine instructress to her sway  Pleas'd he assents nor heeds the distant goal  To which her voice conducts him Thus hath God  Still looking tow'rd his own high purpose fix'd  The virtues of his creatures thus he rules  The parent's fondness and the patriot's zeal  Thus the warm sense of honour and of shame  The vows of gratitude the faith of love  And all the comely intercourse of praise  The joy of human life the earthly heav'n  How far unlike them must the lot of guilt  Be found or what terrestrial wo can match  The selfconvicted bosom which hath wrought  The bane of others or enslav'd itself  With shackles vile Not poison nor sharp fire  Nor the worst pangs that ever monkish hate  Suggested or despotick Rage impos'd  Were at that season an unwish'd exchange  When the soul loathes herself when flying thence  To crowds on ev'ry brow she sees portray'd  Fell demons Hate or Scorn which drive her back  To solitude her Judge's voice divine  To hear in secret haply sounding thro'  The troubled dreams of midnight and still still  Demanding for his violated laws  Fit recompense or charging her own tongue  To speak th' award of justice on herself  For well she knows what faithful hints within  Were whisper'd to beware the lying forms  Which turn'd her footsteps from the safer way  What cautions to suspect their painted dress  And look with steady eyelid on their smiles  Their frowns their tears In vain the dazzling hues  Of Fancy and Opinion's eager voice  Too much prevail'd for mortals tread the path  In which Opinion says they follow good  Or fly from evil and Opinion gives  Report of good or evil as the scene  Was drawn by Fancy pleasing or deform'd  Thus her report can never there be true  Where Fancy cheats the intellectual eye  With glaring colours and distorted lines  Is there a man to whom the name of death  Brings terrour's ghastly pageants conjur'd up  Before him deathbed groans and dismal vows  And the frail soul plung'd headlong from the brink  Of life and daylight down the gloomy air  An unknown depth to gulfs of tort'ring sire  Unvisited by mercy then what hand  Can snatch this dreamer from the fatal toils  Which Fancy' and Opinion thus conspire  To twine around his heart or who shall hush  Their clamour when they tell him that to die  To risk those horrours is a direr curse  Than basest life can bring Tho' Love with pray'rs  Most tender with Affliction's sacred tears  Beseech his aid tho' Gratitude and Faith  Condemn each step which loiters yet let none  Make answer for him that if any frown  Of danger thwart his path he will not stay  Content and be a wretch to be secure  Here vice begins then at the gate of life  Ere the young multitude to diverse roads  Part like fond pilgrims on a journey unknown  Sits Fancy deep enchantress and to each  With kind maternal looks presents her bowl  A potent bev'rage Heedless they comply  Till the whole soul from that mysterious draught  Is ting'd and ev'ry transient thought imbibes  Of gladness or disgust desire or fear  One homebred colour which not all the lights  Of science e'er shall change not all the storms  Of adverse fortune wash away nor yet  The robe of purest virtue quite conceal  Thence on they pass where meeting frequent shapes  Of good and evil cunning phantoms apt  To fire or freeze the breast with them they join  In dang'rous parley list'ning oft' and oft'  Gazing with reckless passion while its garb  The spectre heightens and its pompous tale  Repeats with some new circumstance to suit  That early tincture of the hearer's soul  And should the guardian Reason but for one  Short moment yield to this illusive scene  His ear and eye th' intoxicating charm  Involves him till no longer he discerns  Or only guides to err Then revel forth  A furious band that spurn him from the throne  And all is uproar hence Ambition climbs  With sliding feet and hands impure to grasp  Those solemn toys which glitter in his view  On Fortune's rugged steep hence pale Revenge  Unsheaths her murd'rous dagger Rapine hence  And envious Lust by venal Fraud upborne  Surmount the rev'rend barrier of the laws  Which kept them from their prey hence all the crimes  That e'er defil'd the earth and all the plagues  That follow them for vengeance in the guise  Of honour safety pleasure ease or pomp  Stole first into the fond believing mind  Yet not by Fancy's witchcraft on the brain  Are always the tumult'ous passions driv'n  To guilty deeds nor Reason bound in chains  That Vice alone may lord it oft' adorn'd  With motley pageants Folly mounts his throne  And plays her idiot anticks like a queen  A thousand garbs she wears a thousand ways  She whirls her giddy empireLo thus far  With hold adventure to the Mantuan lyre  I sing for contemplation link'd with love  A pensive theme now haply should my song  Unbend that serious count'nance and learn  Thalia's tripping gait her shrillton'd voice  Her wiles familiar whether scorn she darts  In wanton ambush from her lip or eye  Or whether with a sad disguise of care  O'ermantling her gay brow she acts in sport  The deeds of Folly and from all sides round  Calls forth impetuous Laughter's gay rebuke  Her province But thro' ev'ry comick scene  To lead my Muse with her light pencil arm'd  Thro' ev'ry swift occasion which the hand  Of Laughter points at when the mirthful sting  Distends her lab'ring sides and chokes her tongue  Were endless as to sound each grating note  With which the rooks and chatt'ring daws and grave  Unwieldy inmates of the village pond  The changing seasons of the sky proclaim  Sun cloud or show'r Suffice it to have said  Where'r the pow'r of Ridicule displays  Her quaintey'd visage some incongr'ous form  Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd  Strikes on her quick perception whether Pomp  Or Praise or Beauty be dragg'd in and shown  Where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds  Where foul Deformity is wont to dwell  Or whether these with shrewd and wayward spite  Invade resplendent Pomp's imperious mien  The charms of Beauty or the boast of Praise  Ask we for what fair end th' Almighty Sire  In mortal bosoms stirs this gay contempt  These grateful pangs of laughter from disgust  Educing pleasure Wherefore but to aid  The tardy steps of Reason and at once  By this prompt impulse urge us to depress  Wild Folly's aims for tho' the sober light  Of Truth slow dawning on the watchful mind  At length unfolds thro' many a subtle tie  How these uncouth disorders end at last  In publick evil yet benignant Heav'n  Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears  To thousands conscious what a scanty pause  From labour and from care the wider lot  Of humble life affords for studious thought  To scan the maze of Nature therefore stamp'd  These glaring scenes with characters of scorn  As broad as obvious to the passing clown  As to the letter'd sage's curious eye  But other evils o'er the steps of man  Thro' all his walks impend against whose might  The slender darts of laughter nought avail  A trivial warfare Some like cruel guards  On Nature's evermoving throne attend  With mischief arm'd for him whoe'er shall thwart  The path of her inexorable wheels  While she pursues the work that must be done  Thro' ocean earth and air hence frequent forms  Of wo the merchant with his wealthy bark  Bury'd by dashing waves the traveller  Pierc'd by the pointed lightning in his haste  And the poor husbandman with folded arms  Surveying his lost labours and a heap  Of blasted chaff the product of the field  Whence he expected bread But worse than these  I deem far worse that other race of ills  Which humankind rear up among themselves  That horrid off  pring which misgovern'd Will  B  s to fantastick Errour Vices Crimes  Furies that curse the earth and make the blows  The heaviest blows of Nature's innocent hand  Seem sport which are indeed but as the care  Of a wise parent who solicits good  To all her house tho' haply at the price  Of tears and froward wailing and reproach  From some unthinking child whom not the less  Its mother destines to be happy still  These sources then of pain this double lot  Of evil in th' inheritance of man  Requir'd for his protection no slight force  No careless watch and therefore was his breast  Fenc'd round with passions quick to be alarm'd  Or stubborn to oppose with fear more swift  Than beacons catching flame from hill to hill  Where armies land with anger uncontroll'd  As the young lion bounding on his prey  With sorrow that locks up the struggling heart  And shame that overcasts the drooping eye  As with a cloud of lightning These the part  Perform of eager monitors and goad  The soul more sharply than with points of steel  Her enemies to shun or to resist  And as those passions that converse with good  Are good themselves as hope and love and joy  Among the fairest and the sweetest boons  Of life we rightly count so these which guard  Against invading evil still excite  Some pain some tumult these within the mind  Too oft' admitted or too long retain'd  Shock their frail  eat and by their uncurb'd rage  To savages more fell than Libya breeds  Transform themselves till human thought becomes  A gloomy ruin haunt of shapes unbless'd  Of selftormenting fiends Horrour Despair  Hatred and wicked Envy foes to all  The works of Nature and the gifts of Heav'n  But when thro' blameless paths to righteous ends  Those keener passions urge th' awaken'd soul  I would not as ungracious violence  Their sway describe nor from their free career  The fellowship of Pleasure quite exclude  For what can render to the selfapprov'd  Their temper void of comfort tho' in pain  Who knows not with what majesty divine  The forms of Truth and Justice to the mind  Appear ennobling oft' the sharpest wo  With triumph and rejoicing Who that bears  A human bosom hath not often felt  How dear are all those ties which bind our race  In gentleness together and how sweet  Their force let Fortune's wayward hand the while  Be kind or cruel Ask the faithful youth  Why the cold urn of her whom long he lov'd  So often fills his arms so often draws  His lonely footsteps silent and unseen  To pay the mournful tribute of his tears  Oh he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds  Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego  Those sacred hours when stealing from the noise  Of care and envy sweet remembrance sooths  With virtue's kindest looks his aking breast  And turns his tears to rapture Ask the crowd  Which flies impatient from the village walk  To climb the neighb'ring cliffs when far below  The savage winds have hurl'd upon the coast  Some helpless bark while holy Pity melts  The gen'ral eye or Terrour's icy hand  Smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair  While ev'ry mother closer to her breast  Catcheth her child and pointing where the waves  Foam thro' the shatter'd vessel shrieks aloud  As one poor wretch who spreads his piteous arms  For succour swallow'd by the roaring surge  As now another dash'd against the rock  Drops lifeless down O deemest thou indeed  No pleasing influence here by Nature giv'n  To mutual terrour and Compassion's tears  No tender charm mysterious which attracts  O'er all that edge of pain the social pow'rs  To this their proper action and their end  Ask thy own heart when at the midnight hour  Slow thro' that pensive gloom thy pausing eye  Led by the glimm'ring taper moves around  The rev'rend volumes of the dead the songs  Of Grecian hards and records writ by Fame  For Grecian heroes where the Sovran Pow'r  Of heav'n and earth surveys th' immortal page  Ev'n as a father meditating all  The praises of his son and bids the rest  Of mankind there the fairest model learn  Of their own nature and the noblest deeds  Which yet the world hath seen if then thy soul  Join in the lot of those diviner men  Say when the prospect darkens on thy view  When sunk by many a wound heroick states  Mourn in the dust and tremble at the frown  Of hard Ambition when the gen'rous band  Of youths who fought for freedom and their fires  Lie side by side in death when brutal Force  Usurps the throne of Justice turns the pomp  Of guardian pow'r the majesty of rule  The sword the laurel and the purple robe  To poor dishonest pageants to adorn  A robber's walk and glitter in the eyes  Of such as bow the knee when beauteous works  Rewards of virtue sculptur'd forms which deck'd  With more than human grace the warriour's arch  Or patriot's tomb now victims to appease  Tyrannick Envy strew the common path  With awful ruins when the Muses' haunt  The marble Porch where Wisdom wont to talk  With Socrates or Tully hears no more  Save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks  Or f  ale Supe  tion's midnight pray'r  When ruthless Havock from the hand of Time  Tears the destroying sithe with surer stroke  To mow the monuments of glory down  Till Desolation o'er the grassgrown street  Expands her raven wings and from the gate  Where senates once the weal of nations plann'd  Hisseth the gliding snake thro' hoary weeds  That clasp the mould'ring column thus when all  The widely mournful scene is fix'd within  Thy throbbing bosom when the patriot's tear  Starts from thine eye and thy extended arm  In fancy hurls the thunderbolt of Jove  To fire the impious wreath on Philip's brow  Or dash Octavius from the trophy'd car  Say doth thy secret soul repine to taste  The big distress or wouldst thou then exchange  Those heartennobling sorrows for the lot  Of him who sits amid the gaudy herd  Of silent flatt'rers bending to his nod  And o'er them like a giant casts his eye  And says within himself "I am a king  "And wherefore should the clam'rous voice of Wo  "Intrude upon mine ear" The dregs corrupt  Of barb'rous ages that Circean draught  Of servitude and folly have not yet  Bless'd be th' Eternal Ruler of the world  Yet have not so dishonour'd so deform'd  The native judgment of the human soul  Nor so effac'd the image of her Sire  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  BOOK III  MDCCLXX  WHAT tongue then may explain the various fate  Which reigns o'er earth or who to mortal eyes  Illustrate this perplexing labyrinth  Of joy and wo thro' which the feet of man  Are doom'd to wander That Eternal Mind  From passions wants and envy far estrang'd  Who built the spacious universe and deck'd  Each part so richly with whate'er pertains  To life to health to pleasure why bad he  The viper Evil creeping in pollute  The goodly scene and with insidious rage  While the poor inmate looks around and smiles  Dart her fell sting with poision to his soul  Hard is the question and from ancient days  Hath still oppress'd with care the sage's thought  Hath drawn forth accents from the poet's lyre  Too sad too deeply plaintive nor did e'er  Those chiefs of humankind from whom the light  Of heav'nly truth first gleam'd on barb'rous lands  Forget this dreadful secret when they told  What wondrous things had to their favour'd eyes  And ears on cloudy mountain been reveal'd  Or in deep cave by nymph or pow'r divine  Portentous oft' and wild yet one I know  Could I the speech of lawgivers assume  One old and splendid tale I would record  With which the Muse of Solon in sweet strains  Adorn'd this theme profound and render'd all  Its darkness all its terrours bright as noon  Or gentle as the golden star of eve  Who knows not Solon last and wisest far  Of those whom Greece triumphant in the height  Of glory styl'd her Fathers him whose voice  Thro' Athens hush'd the storm of civil wrath  Taught envious Want and cruel Wealth to join  In friendship and with sweet compalsion tam'd  Minerva's eager people to his laws  Which their own goddess in his breast inspir'd  'Twas now the time when his heroick task  Seem'd but perform'd in vain when sooth'd by years  Of satt'ring service the fond multitude  Hung with their sudden counsels on the breath  Of great Pisistratus that chief renown'd  Whom Hermes and th' Idalian queen had train'd  Ev'n from his birth to ev'ry pow'rful art  Of pleasing and persuading from whose lips  Flow'd eloquence which like the vows of love  Could steal away suspicion from the hearts  Of all who listen'd Thus from day to day  He won the gen'ral suff'rage and beheld  Each rival overshadow'd and depress'd  Beneath his ampler state yet oft' complain'd  As one less kindly treated who had hop'd  To merit favour but submits perforce  To find another's services preferr'd  Nor yet relaxeth aught of faith or zeal  Then tales were scatter'd of his envious foes  Of snares that watch'd his fame of daggers aim'd  Against his life At last with trembling limbs  His hair diffus'd and wild his garments loose  And stain'd with blood from selfinflicted wounds  He burst into the publick place as there  There only were his refuge and declar'd  In broken words with sighs of deep regret  The mortal danger he had scarce repell'd  Fir'd with his tragick tale th' indignant crowd  To guard his steps forthwith a menial band  Array'd beneath his eye for deeds of war  Decree O still too lib'ral of their trust  And oft' betray'd by overgrateful love  The gen'rous people Now behold him fenc'd  By mercenary weapons like a king  Forth issuing from the city gate at eve  To seek his rural mansion and with pomp  Crowding the publick road The swain stops short  And sighs th' officious townsmen stand at gaze  And shrinking give the sullen pageant room  Yet not the less obsequious was his brow  Nor less profuse of courteous words his tongue  Of gracious gifts his hand the while by stealth  Like a small torrent fed with ev'ning show'rs  His train increas'd till at that satal time  Just as the publick eye with doubt and shame  Startled began to question what it saw  Swift as the sound of earthquakes rush'd a voice  Thro' Athens that Pisistratus had fill'd  The rocky citadel with hostile arms  Had barr'd the steep ascent and sat within  Amid his hirelings meditating death  To all whose stubborn necks his yoke resus'd  Where then was Solon After ten long years  Of absence full of haste from foreign shores  The sage the lawgiver had now arriv'd  Arriv'd alas to see that Athens that  Fair temple rais'd by him and sacred call'd  To Liberty and Concord now profan'd  By savage hate or sunk into a den  Of slaves who crouch beneath the master's scourge  And deprecate his wrath and court his chains  Yet did not the wise patriot's grief impede  His virt'ous will nor was his heart inclin'd  One moment with such womanlike distress  To view the transient storms of civil war  As thence to yield his country and her hopes  To alldevouring bondage His bright helm  Ev'n while the traitor's impious act is told  He buckles on his hoary head he girds  With mail his stooping breast the shield the spear  He snatcheth and with swift indignant strides  Wh  assembled people seeks proclaims aloud  It was no time for counsel in their spears  Lay all their prudence now the tyrant yet  Was not so firmly seated on his throne  But that one shock of their united force  Would dash him from the summit of his pride  Headlong and grov'lling in the dust What else  Can reassert the lost Athenian name  So cheaply to the laughter of the world  Betray'd by guile beneath an infant's faith  So mock'd and scorn'd Away then Freedom now  And Safety dwell not but with fame in arms  Myself will shew you where their mansion lies  And thro' the walks of danger or of death  Conduct you to them While he spake thro' all  Their crowded ranks his quick sagacious eye  He darted where no cheerful voice was heard  Of social daring no stretch'd arm was seen  Hast'ning their common task but pale mistrust  Wrinkled each brow theyshook their heads and down  Their slack hands hung cold sighs and whisper'd doubts  From breath to breath stole round The sage meantime  Look'd speechless on while his big bosom heav'd  Struggling with shame and sorrow till at last  A tear broke forth and "O immortal Shades  "O Theseus" he exclaim'd "O Codrus where  "Where are ye now behold for what ye toil'd  "Thro' life behold for whom ye chose to die"  No more he added but with lonely steps  Weary and slow his silver beard depress'd  And his stern eyes bent heedless on the ground  Back to his silent dwelling he repair'd  There o'er the gate his armour as a man  Whom from the service of the war his chief  Dismisseth after no inglorious toil  He fix'd in gen'ral view one wishful look  He sent unconscious tow'rd the publick place  At parting then beneath his quiet roof  Without a word without a sigh retir'd  Scarce had the morrow's sun his golden rays  From sweet Hymettus darted o'er the fanes  Of Cecrops to the Salaminian shores  When lo on Solon's threshold met the feet  Of four Athenians by the same sad care  Conducted all than whom the state beheld  None nobler First came Megacles the son  Of great Alemeon whom the Lydian king  The mild unhappy Croesus in his days  Of glory had with costly gifts adorn'd  Fair vessels splendid garments tinctur'd webs  And heaps of treasur'd gold beyond the lot  Of many sovrans thus requiting well  That hospitable favour which erewhile  Alemeon to his messengers had shewn  Whom he with off'rings worthy of the god  Sent from his throne in Sardis to revere  Apollo's Delphick shrine With Megacles  Approach'd his son whom Agarista bore  The virtuous child of Clisthenes whose hand  Of Grecian sceptres the most ancient far  In Sicyon sway'd but greater fame he drew  From arms controll'd by justice from the love  Of the wise Muses and the unenvy'd wreath  Which gla  Olympia gave for thither once  His warlike steeds the hero led and there  Contended thro' the tumult of the course  With skilful wheels Then victor at the goal  Amid th' applauses of assembled Greece  High on his car he stood and wav'd his arm  Silence ensu'd when straight the herald's voice  Was heard inviting ev'ry Grecian youth  Whom Clisthenes content might call his son  To visit ere twice thirty days were pass'd  The towers of Sicyon There the chief decreed  Within the circuit of the following year  To join at Hymen's altar hand in hand  With his fair daughter him among the guests  Whom worthiest he should deem Forthwith from all  The bounds of Greece th' ambitious wooers came  From rich Hesperia from th' Illyrian shore  Where Epidamnus over Adria's surge  Looks on the setting sun from those brave tribes  Chaonian or Molossian whom the race  Of great Achilles governs glorying still  In Troy o'erthrown from rough Aetolia nurse  Of men who first among the Greeks threw off  The yoke of kings to commerce and to arms  Devoted from Thessalia's fertile meads  Where flows Peneus near the lofty walls  Of Cranon old from strong Eretria queen  Of all Euboean cities who sublime  On the steep margin of Euripus views  Across the tide the Marathonian plain  Not yet the haunt of glory Athens too  Minerva's care among her graceful sons  Found equal lovers for the princely maid  Nor was proud Argos wanting nor the domes  Of sacred Elis nor th'Arcadian groves  That overshade Alpheus echoing oft'  Some shepherd's song But thro' th' illustrious band  Was none who might with Megacles compare  In all the honours of unblemish'd youth  His was the beauteous bride and now their son  Young Clisthenes betimes at Solon's gate  Stood anxious leaning forward on the arm  Of his great sire with earnest eyes that ask'd  When the slow hinge would turn with restless feet  And cheeks now pale now glowing for his heart  Throbb'd full of bursting passions anger grief  With scorn imbitter'd by the gen'rous boy  Scarce understood but which like noble seeds  Are destin'd for his country and himself  In riper years to bring forth fruits divine  Of liberty and glory Next appear'd  Two brave companions whom one mother bore  To diff'rent lords but whom the better ties  Of firm esteem and friendship render'd more  Than brothers first Miltiades who drew  From godlike Aeacus his ancient line  That Aeacus whose unimpeach'd renown  For sanctity and justice won the lyre  Of elder bards to celebrate him thron'd  In Hades o'er the dead where his decrees  The guilty soul within the burning gates  Of Tartarus compel or send the good  T' inhabit with eternal health and peace  The vallies of Elysium From a stem  So sacred ne'er could worthier scion spring  Than this Miltiades whose aid ere long  The chiefs of Thrace already on their ways  Sent by th' inspir'd foreknowing maid who sits  Upon the Delphick tripod shall implore  To wield their sceptre and the rural wealth  Of fruitful Chersonesus to protect  With arms and laws but nothing careful now  Save for his injur'd country here he stands  In deep solicitude with Cimon join'd  Unconscious both what widely diff'rent lots  Await them taught by Nature as they are  To know one common good one common ill  For Cimon not his valour not his birth  Deriv'd from Codrus not a thousand gifts  Dealt round him with a wise benignant hand  No not th' Olympick olive by himself  From his own brow transferr'd to sooth the mind  Of this Pisistratus can long preserve  From the sell envy of the tyrant's sons  And their assassin dagger But if death  Obscure upon his gentle steps attend  Yet Fate an ample recompense prepares  In his victorious son that other great  Miltiades who o'er the very throne  Of glory shall with Time's assiduous hand  In adamantine characters engrave  The name of Athens and by Freedom arm'd  'Gainst the gigantick pride of Asia's king  Shall all th' achievements of the heroes old  Surmount of Hercules of all who sail'd  From Thessaly with Jason all who fought  For empire or for fame at Thebes or Troy  Such were the patriots who within the porch  Of Solon had assembled but the gate  Now opens and across the ample floor  Straight they proceed into an open space  Bright with the beams of morn a verdant spot  Where stands a rural altar pil'd with sods  Cut from the grassy turf and girt with wreaths  Of branching palm Here Solon's self they found  Clad in a robe of purple pure and deck'd  With leaves of olive on his rev'rend brow  He bow'd before the altar and o'er cakes  Of barley from two earthen vessels pour'd  Of honey and of milk a plenteous stream  Calling meantime the Muses to accept  His simple off'ring by no victim ting'd  With blood nor sully'd by destroying fire  But such as for himself Apollo claims  In his own Delos where his fav'rite haunt  Is thence the altar of the Pious nam'd  Unseen the guests drew near and silent view'd  That worship till the hero priest his eye  Turn'd tow'rd a seat on which prepar'd there lay  A branch of laurel then his friends confess'd  Before him stood Backward his step he drew  As loth that care or tumult should approach  Those early rites divine but soon their looks  So anxious and their hands held forth with such  Desponding gesture bring him on perforce  To speak to their affliction "Are ye come"  He cry'd "to mourn with me this common shame  "Or ask ye some new effort which may break  "Our fetters Know then of the publick cause  "Not for yon' traitor's cunning or his might  "Do I despair nor could I wish from Jove  "Aught dearer than at this late hour of life  "As once by laws so now by strenuous arms  "From impious violation to assert  "The rights our fathers left us But alas  "What arms or who shall wield them Ye beheld  "Th' Athenian people Many bitter days  "Must pass and many wounds from cruel Pride  "Be felt ere yet their partial hearts find room  "For just resentment or their hands endure  "To smite this tyrant brood so near to all  "Their hopes so oft' admir'd so long belov'd  "That time will come however Be it yours  "To watch its fair approach and urge it on  "With honest prudence me it ill beseems  "Again to supplicate th unwilling crowd  "To rescue from a vile deceiver's hold  "That envy'd pow'r which once with eager ze  l  "They offer'd to myself nor can I plunge  "In counsels deep and various nor prepare  "For distant wars thus falt'ring as I tread  "On life's last verge ere long to join the shades  "Of Minos and Lycurgus But behold  "What care employs me now My vows I pay  "To the sweet Muses teachers of my youth  "And solace of my age If right I deem  "Of the still voice that whispers at my heart  "Th' immortal Sisters have not quite withdrawn  "Their old harmonious influence Let your tongues  "With sacred silence favour what I speak  "And haply shall my faithful lips be taught  "T' unfold celestial counsels which may arm  "As with impenetrable steel your breasts  "For the long strife before you and repel  "The darts of adverse Fate" He said and snatch'd  The laurel bough and sat in silence down  Fix'd wrapp'd in solemn musing full before  The sun who now from all his radiant orb  Drove the grey clouds and pour'd his genial light  Upon the breast of Solon Solon rais'd  Aloft the leasy rod and thus began  "Ye beauteous offspring of Olympian Jove  "And Memory divine Pierian Maids  "Hear me propitious In the morn of life  "When hope shone bright and all the prospect smil'd  "To your sequester'd mansion oft' my steps  "Were turn'd O Muses and within your gate  "My off'rings paid Ye taught me then with strains  "Of flowing harmony to soften War's  "Dire voice or in fair colours that might charm  "The publick eye to clothe the form austere  "Of civil counsel Now my feeble age  "Neglected and supplanted of the hope  "On which it lean'd yet sinks not but to you  "To your mild wisdom flies refuge belov'd  "Of solitude and silence Ye can teach  "The visions of my bed whate'er the gods  "In the rude ages of the world inspir'd  "Or the first herdes acted ye can make  "The morning light more gladsome to my sense  "Than ever it appear'd to active youth  "Pursuing careless pleasure ye can give  "To this long leisure these unheeded hours  "A labour as sublime as when the sons  "Of Athens throng'd and speechless round me stood  "To hear pronounc'd for all their future deeds  "The bounds of right and wrong Celestial Pow'rs  "I feel that ye are near me and behold  "To meet your energy divine I bring  "A high and sacred theme not less than those  "Which to th' eternal custody of Fame  "Your lips intrusted when of old ye deign'd  "With Orpheus or with Homer to frequent  "The groves of Hemus or the Chian shore  "Ye know harmonious Maids for what of all  "My various life was e'er from you estrang'd  "Oft' hath my solitary song to you  "Reveal'd that duteous pride which turn'd my steps  "To willing exile earnest to withdraw  "From envy and the disappointed thirst  "Of lucre lest the bold familiar strife  "Which in the eye of Athens they upheld  "Against her legislator should impair  "With trivial doubt the rev'rence of his laws  "To Egypt therefore thro' th' Aegean isles  "My course I steer'd and by the banks of Nile  "Dwelt in Canopus thence the hallow'd domes  "Of Sais and the rites to Isis paid  "I sought and in her temple's silent courts  "Thro' many changing moons attentive heard  "The venerable Sonchis while his tongue  "At morn or midnight the deep story told  "Of her who represents whate'er has been  "Or is or shall be whose mysterious veil  "No mortal hand hath ever yet remov'd  "By him exhorted southward to the walls  "Of On I pass'd the city of the Sun  "The ever youthful god 't was there amid  "His priests and sages who the livelong night  "Watch the dread movements of the starry sphere  "Or who in wondrous fables half disclose  "The secrets of the elements it was there  "That great Psenophis taught my raptur'd ears  "The same of old Atlantis of her chiefs  "And her pure laws the first which earth obey'd  "Deep in my bosom sunk the noble tale  "And often while I listen'd did my mind  "Foretel with what delight her own free lyre  "Should some time for an Attick audience raise  "Anew that losty scene and from their tombs  "Call forth those ancient demigods to speak  "Of justice and the hidden providence  "That walks among mankind But yet meantime  "The mystick pomp of Ammon's gloomy sons  "Became less pleasing with contempt I gaz'd  "On that tame garb and those unvarying paths  "To which the double yoke of king and priest  "Had cramp'd the sullen race At last with hymns  "Invoking our own Pallas and the gods  "Of cheerful Greece a glad farewell I gave  "To Egypt and before the southern wind  "Spread my full fails What climes I then survey'd  "What fortunes I encounter'd in the realm  "Of Croesus or upon the Cyprian shore  "The Muse who prompts my bosom doth not now  "Consent that I reveal But when at length  "Ten times the sun returning from the south  "Hadstrow'dwith flow'rs the verdant earth and fill'd  "The groves with musick pleas'd I then beheld  "The term of those long errours drawing nigh  "Nor yet I said will I sit down within  "The walls of Athens till my seet have trod  "The Cretan soil have pierc'd those rev'rend haunts  "Whence Law and civil Concord issu'd forth  "As from their ancient home and still to Greece  "Their wisest loftiest discipline proclaim  "Straight where Amnisus mart of wealthy ships  "Appears beneath sam'd Gnossus and her tow'rs  "Like the fair handmaid of a stately queen  "I check'd my prow and thence with eager steps  "The city' of Minos enter'd O ye Gods  "Who taught the leaders of the simpler time  "By written words to curb the untow'rd will  "Of mortals how within that gen'rous isle  "Have ye the triumphs of your pow'r display'd  "Munificent Those splendid merchants lords  "Of traffick and the sea with what delight  "I saw them at their publick meal like sons  "Of the same household join the plainer sort  "Whose wealth was only freedom whence to those  "Vile envy and to those fantastick pride  "Alike was strange but noble concord still  "Cherish'd the strength untam'd the rustick faith  "Of their first fathers Then the growing race  "How pleasing to behold them in their schools  "Their sports their labours ever plac'd within  "O shade of Minos thy controlling eye  "Here was a docile band in tuneful tones  "Thy laws pronouncing or with lofty hymns  "Praising the bounteous gods or to preserve  "Their country's heroes from oblivious night  "Resounding what the Muse inspir'd of old  "There on the verge of manhood others met  "In heavy armour thro' the heats of noon  "To march the rugged mountain's height to climb  "With measur'd swiftness from the hardbent bow  "To send resistless arrows to their mark  "Or for the fame of prowess to contend  "Now wrestling now with fists and staves oppos'd  "Now with the biting falchion and the fence  "Of brazen shields while still the warbling flute

religious footsteps he had taught  "Their sires t' approach the wild Dictean cave  "Where Jove was born the ever verdant meads  "Of Ida and the spacious grotto where  "His active youth he pass'd and where his throne  "Yet stands mysterious whither Minos came  "Each ninth returning year the king of gods  "And mortals there in secret to consult  "On justice and the tables of his law  "T' inscribe

summon'd all the genial country round  "By sacrifice and pomp to bring to mind  "That first great spousal while th' enamour'd youths  "And virgins with the priest before the shrine  "Observe the same pure ritual and invoke  "The same glad omens There among the crowd  "Of strangers from those naval cities drawn  "Which deck like gems the island's northern shore  "A merchant of Aegina I descry'd  "My ancient host but forward as I sprung  "To meet him he with dark dejected brow  "Stopp'd half averse and "O Athenian guest"  "He said "art thou in Crete these joyful rites  "Partaking Know thy laws are blotted out  "Thy Country kneels before a tyrant's throne"  "He added names of men with hostile deeds  "Disastrous which obscure and indistinct  "I heard for while he spake my heart grew cold  "And my eyes dim the altars and their train  "No more were present to me how I far'd  "Or whither turn'd I know not nor recall  "Aught of those moments other than the sense  "Of one who struggles in oppressive sleep  "And from the toils of some distressful dream  "To break away with palpitating heart  "Weak limbs and temples bath'd in deathlike dew  "Makes many a painful effort When at last  "The sun and Nature's face again appear'd  "Not far I found me where the publick path  "Winding thro' cypress groves and swelling meads  "From Gnossus to the cave of Jove ascends  "Heedless I follow'd on till soon the skirts  "Of Ida rose before me and the vault  "Wideop'ning pierc'd the mountain's rocky side  "Ent'ring within the threshold on the ground  "I slung me sad faint overworn with toil  * *

o'er the scene some rustick tow'r  Founded by Norman or by Saxon hands  O ye Northumbrian Shades which overlook  The rocky pavement and the mossy falls  Of solitary Wensbeck's limpid stream  How gladly I recall your wellknown seats  Belov'd of old and that delightful time  When all alone for many a summer's day  I wander'd thro' your calm recesses led  In silence by some pow'rful hand unseen  Nor will I e'er forget you nor shall e'er  The graver tasks of manhood or th' advice  Of vulgar wisdom move me to disclaim  Those studies which possess'd me in the dawn  Of life and fix'd the colour of my mind  For ev'ry future year whence even now  From sleep I rescue the clear hours of morn  And while the world around lies overwhelm'd  In idle darkness am alive to thoughts  Of honourable fame of truth divine  Or moral and of minds to virtue won  By the sweet magick of harmonious verse  The themes which now expect us For thus far  On gen'ral habits and on arts which grow  Spontaneous in the minds of all mankind  Hath dwelt our argument and how selftaught  Tho' seldom conscious of their own employ  In Nature's or in Fortune's changeful scene  Men learn to judge of beauty and acquire  Those forms set up as idols in the soul  For love and zealous praise Yet indistinct  In vulgar bosoms and unnotic'd lie  These pleasing stores unless the casual force  Of things external prompt the heedless mind  To recognize her wealth But some there are  Conscious of Nature and the rule which man  O'er Nature holds some who within themselves  Retiring from the trivial scenes of chance  And momentary passion can at will  Call up these fair exemplars of the mind  Review their features scan the secret laws  Which bind them to each other and display  By forms or sounds or colours to the sense  Of all the world their latent charms display  Ev'n as in Nature's frame if such a word  If such a word so bold may from the lips  Of man proceed as in this outward frame  Of things the Great Artificer portrays  His own immense idea Various names  Th  se among mortals bear as various signs  They use and by peculiar organs speak  To human sense There are who by the flight  Of air thro' tubes with moving stops distinct  Or by extended chords in measure taught  To vibrate can assemble pow'rful sounds  Expressing ev'ry temper of the mind  From ev'ry cause and charming all the soul  With passion void of care others meantime  The rugged mass of metal wood or stone  Patiently taming or with easier hand  Describing lines and with more ample scope  Uniting colours can to gen'ral sight  Produce those permanent and perfect forms  Those characters of heroes and of gods  Which from the crude materials of the world  Their own high minds created But the chief  Are poets eloquent men who dwell on earth  To clothe whate'er the soul admires or loves  With language and with numbers hence to these  A field is open'd wide as Nature's sphere  Nay wider various as the sudden acts  Of human wit and vast as the demands  Of human will The bard nor length nor depth  Nor place nor form controls To eyes to ears  To ev'ry organ of the copious mind  He offereth all its treasures Him the hours  The seasons him obey and changeful Time  Sees him at will keep measure with his flight  At will outstrip it To enhance his toil  He summoneth from th' uttermost extent  Of things which God hath taught him ev'ry form  Auxiliar ev'ry pow'r and all beside  Excludes imperious His prevailing hand  Gives to corporeal essence life and sense  And ev'ry stately function of the soul  The soul itself to him obsequious lies  Like matter's passive heap and as he wills  To reason and affection he assigns  Their just alliances their just degrees  Whence his peculiar honours whence the race  Of men who people his delightful world  Men genuine and according to themselves  Transcend as far th' uncertain sons of earth  As earth itself to his delightful world  The palm of spotless beauty doth resign  *
