 THE CITIZEN  A FARCE  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL in Covent Garden  By ARTHUR MURPHY  Esq  Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit  HOR  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY in Ludgate Street  MDCCLXIII  Price ONE SHILLING  Lincoln'sinn  th  Jan    THE Author's compliments to Miss EL∣LIOT and he desires to inscribe to her the following scenes She need not be alarmed at a dedication the propriety of which will strike every reader who remembers that Miss ELLIOT and the CITIZEN made their first appearance on the stage together and that her uncommon talents gave the piece the best and most effectual protection Elegance of figure a voice of plea∣sing variety a strong expression of humour not impaired but rendered exquisite by delicacy these were circumstances that secured the farce at first and have since brought it into favour No author ever met with a better patronage and though the CITIZEN like other  things of this kind  has many faults yet it has this peculiar merit that it produced in the character of MA∣RIA a genuine comic genius The CITIZEN claims another praise When all the little arts of theatrical malice were conspiring against her it recommended Miss ELLIOT to the notice of Mr BEARD and obtained for her that generous treat∣ment which  that manager  seems determined to extend to real merit The Author therefore de∣sires Miss ELLIOT'S acceptance of this farce for the defects of which he makes no apology be∣cause should the most severe judge in this kind resolve to arm himself with criticisms let him but look at the acting of MARIA  and he will forget them all

Phil  It only draws a man in to lend money  Old Phil  Ay ay  G Phil  There was your neighbour's son Dick Worthy who was always cramming his head with Greek and Latin at school he wanted to borrow of me the other day but I was too cunning  Old Phil  Ay ayLet him draw bills of exchange in Greek and Latin and see where he will get a pound sterling for them  G Phil  So I told himI went to him to his garret in the Minories and there I found him in all his misery and a fine scene it wasThere was his wife in a corner of the room at a washingtub up to the elbows in suds a solitary porkstake was dangling by a bit of packthread before a melancholy fire himself seated at a threelegg'd table writing a pamphlet against the German war a child upon his left knee his rightleg employ'd in rocking a cradle with a bratling in itAnd so there was business enough for them allHis wife rubbing away  mimicks a washerwoman  and he writing on  The King of Prussia shall have no more subsidies Saxony shall
