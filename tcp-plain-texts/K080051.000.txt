 THE SPIRIT of  MASONRY  in  MORAL  and  ELUCIDATORY LECTURES  by W  M  HUTCHINSON MASTER of the Barnardcastle Lodge of CONCORD  LONDON  Printed for J WILKIE  N  o    in St Paul's Churchyard and W GOLDSMITH  N  o    PaternosterRow  MDCCLXXV  THE SANCTION  WHEREAS brother William Hutchinson has compiled a book intitled "The Spirit of Ma∣sonry" and has requested our sanc∣tion for the publication thereof we having perused the said book and finding it will be of use to this society do recommend the same  PETRE G M  ROWLAND HOLT D G M  THOMAS NOEL S G W  JOHN HATCH J G W  ROWLAND BERKLEY G T  JAMES HESELTINE G S  TO THE ANTIENT AND HONOUR∣ABLE SOCIETY  of  FREE AND AC∣CEPTED MASONS  BRETHREN  THE following LECTURES were composed for the use of the LODGE over which I presided for several succes∣sive years Since that time I have added explanatory notes to support my propo∣sitions or exemplify the principles of the work  With the utmost humility and diffi∣dence I give these LECTURES to the public they may indeed serve to detect the wretched artifices used by wicked men to impose upon the world and if I succeed so far with YOU as to excite the due exercise of those moral works which our PROFESSION enjoins I shall have my reward  From the nature of our SOCIETY and its LAWS it is difficult to write on the subject of MASONRYWe are not  allowed that explicit language any other topic would admit ofMy diction will appear technical and abstruse to all but MASONS and with the CRITIC I am exposed to every degree of severity with∣out his candour will admit the MORAL INTENTION of the WORK in exte∣nuation of those imperfections our mysti∣cal expression throws upon the following pages  As SUPREME of this SOCIETY the Right Honourable the LORD PETRE in the first place and after him MR HOLT and the OFFICERS OF THE GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND command my most humble acknowledgments and gra∣titude for the candour and condescen∣tion with which this little work was re∣ceived under their precedency  MY LORD PETRE  DEDICATIONS my Lord were originally devised by authors as supplications for protection of their labours under the illustrious character to which they were ad∣dressed  It is

heads to arrange my observations on the nature of this Society  On my initiation I was struck with the ceremonials and immediately appre∣hended there was more conveyed by them than appeared to the vulgar eye as I attended to the matter I was con∣vinced my first impressions were just and by my researches to discover their implications I presume I have acquired some degree of knowledge touching the  Origin of Masonry the reasons of its several institutions the meaning of its various symbols and their import toge∣ther with the progress of the profession  It is known to the world but more particularly to my Brethren that there are three degrees of MASONSAP∣PRENTICES CRAFTSMEN and MAS∣TERSthe initiation to and several advancements from the order of AP∣PRENTICES will necessarily lead my observations to three distinct channels  How the several mysteries are revealed to MASONS they alone knowso stead∣fastly have the FRATERNITY pre∣served their Faith for many ages that this remains a secret to the world in defiance of the corruptions and vices of Mankind  In order to comprehend our PRO∣FESSION we must look back into the remotest antiquity and from thence col∣lect the several parts which have been united in the forming of our Orderin the first place we must give our atten∣tion  to the Creation of Man and the state of our first Parent in the Garden of Eden  Genesisch i ver  And God said let us make man in our image after our likeness  Ver  So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him  Ver  And God saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good  Ch ver  And the Lord God formed the man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul  It is not to be doubted when Adam came from out the hand of his Creator the Image of God from whom he im∣mediately proceeded that he was per∣fect in Symetry and Beauty that he was made in the highest degree of excel∣lence human nature was capable of on earthcalculated for Regions of Felicity and Paradise where sin or sorrow had not known existencemade in such per∣fection of body and mind that he could endure the presence of God and was capable of conversing with the Almighty  face to face  Genesis ch ii ver Ch iii ver  so much was he superior to the chosen ones of IsraelHe was endowed with understanding suitable to his station as one whom the Almighty deigned to visit and his heart was pos∣sessed of all the VIRTUES unpolluted endowments of an heavenly temper his hours were full of wisdom exulta∣tion and transportthe Book of Nature was revealed to his comprehension and all her mysteries were open to his un∣derstandinghe knew whence and what he wasEven this was but a minute degree of his capacity for astonishing as it may appear to us yet it is an uncontrovertable truth that he had a competent knowledge of the mighty the tremendous CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSEhe saw him with his natural eyes he heard his voice he un∣derstood his laws and was present to his Majesty  To this fountain of human perfection and wisdom we must necessarily look  back for all the science and learning which blessed the earliest ages of the worldcalculated for such exalted feli∣city and elevated enjoyments placed in regions of peace where Angels ministred and the Divinity walked abroad was the parent of mankind  But alas he fellhis disobedience forfeited all that glory and felicityand horrible to recount even in the midst of this exalted state SATAN prevailed  If we presume to estimate the change which befel ADAM on his expulsion from Paradise by the deformity that took place on the face of the world we should be apt to believe the exile though not distorted in body was yet darkened in understandinginstead of confidence and steady faith that distrust and jealousy would take place and disbelief confound even testimony that argument would be deprived of definition and wander by excentric propositions that confusion would usurp the throne of wisdom and folly of judgment thorns and thistles grow up in the place of those excellent  flowers of science which flourished in Eden and darkness cloud the day of his capacity  It is not possible for me to determine from any evidence given to us in what degree disobedience and sin immediately contracted the understanding of ADAM but we are certain that great and dread∣ful effects very early took place on Adam's posterityWe may conclude memory was retained by our first parent in all its energya terrible portion of the punish∣ment his disobedience had incurred re∣storing to him perfect images and neverdying estimates of what he had lost and thereby increasing the bitterness of what he had purchased Through the endow∣ments of memory ADAM would neces∣sarily teach to his family the sciences which he had comprehended in Eden and the knowledge he had gained of NATURE and her GODIt will fol∣low that some of them would retain those lessons of wisdom and faithfully transmit them to posterityNo doubt the family of Cain who bore the seal  of the curse on his forehead was given up to ignorance  Genesis cha iv ver  And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord  Tradition would deliver down the doc∣trines of our first parents with the utmost truth and certainty whilst the Antidelu∣vians enjoyed that longivity of which the books of Moses give evidencebut when men came to multiply exceedingly upon the face of the earth and were dispersed to the distant regions of the globe then the inestimable lessons of KNOWLEDGE and TRUTH taught by the first men fell into confusion and corruption and were retained pure and in perfection but by few those few to our great consolation have handed them down to after ages they also retained the UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE uncor∣rupted with the confusion of the plains of Shinar and preserved it to posterity  Thus we must necessarily look back to OUR FIRST PARENT as the original Professor of the WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD to whom the Religion and  mysteries of NATURE were first reveal∣ed and from whom all the WISDOM of the world was in the beginning derived  In those times when the present Rules and maxims of our profession of FREE MASONRY had their beginning the minds of men were possessed of Allego∣ries Emblems and mystic devices in which peculiar sciences manners insti∣tutions and doctrines in many nations were wrapt upthis was an invention of the earliest ages the priests in Egypt se∣creted the mysteries of their religion from the vulgar by symbols and hieroglyphics comprehensible alone to those of their own order The priests of Rome and Greece practised other subtleties by which the art of divination was enveiled and their oracles were intelligible only to their brethren who expounded them to the people  These examples were WISELY adopted for the purposes of concealing the myste∣ries of MASONRYlike the Cybil's leaves the secrets of the brotherhood would appear to the world as indistinct  and scattered fragments whilst they con∣vey to MASONS an uniform and wellconnected system  In the forming of this society which is at once RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL great regard has been given to the first knowledge of the GOD OF NATURE and that acceptable service wherewith he is well pleased  This was the first stage on which our originals thought it expedient to place the foundation of MASONRYthey had experienced that from religion all civil ties and obligations were compacted and that thence proceeded all the bonds which could unite mankind in social in∣tercoursehence it was that they laid the corner stone of the EDIFICE on the bosom of religion  Religions  all descending from the skies  To wretched man the goddess in her left  Holds out this world and in her right the next  Religion  the sole voucher man is man  Supporter sole of man above himself  Ev'n in this night of frailty change and death  She gives the soul a soul that acts a  God  Religion Providence an after state  Here  is firm footing here is solid rock  This can support us all is sea besides  Sinks under us bestorms and then devours  His hand the good man fastens on the skies  And bids earth roll nor feels her idle whirl  Young's Night Thoughts  In the earliest ages after the deluge in those nations made known to us the service of the true God was clouded with imagery and defiled by idolatryMen who had not been taught the doctrines of truth by those who retained the wis∣dom of the Antideluvians but were left to the operations of their own judg∣ments perceived that there was some great cause of nature's uniformity and wonderful progressions of her works suitable to their ignorance they repre∣sented the Author of those works by such objects as struck their observation for their powerful effects on the face of the worldfrom whence the SUN AND  MOON became the symbols of the Deity  The posterity of  Ham  forsook the doctrines of their predecessor for the Deity whose adoration he taught they soon substituted the symbol and for the original worshipped the  Sun  which was regarded in the first ages after the deluge as the  Type  or  Emblem  of the  Divinity  The descendants of  Chus  called  Cuthites  were those Emigrants who carried their rites religions and customs into various quarters of the globe they were the first apostates from the  Truth  yet great in worldly wisdomthey were joined in their expeditions by other nations especially by the collateral branches of their family the  Mizraim Caphtorim  and the sons of  Canaan  these were all of the line of  Ham  who was held by his posteritie in the highest venerationthey called him  Amon  and hav∣in process of time raised him to a Divinity they worshipped him as the  Sun  and from this wor∣ship they were stiled  Amonians  The Deitie which they worshipped was the  Sun  but they soon conferred his titles upon some of their ancestors whence arose a mixed worship They particularly deified the great Patriarch who was the head of their line and worshipped him as the  Fountain of Light  ma∣king the  Sun  only an emblem of his influence and power  Bryant's Analysis of ancient Mythology  MOSES was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians he was initiated in all the knowledge of the WISEMEN of that nation by whom the learning of anti∣quity had been retained and held sacred wrapped up from the eye of the wicked and vulgar in symbols and hieroglyphics and communicated to men of their own order only with care secrecy and cir∣cumspectionThis secrecy is not in any wise to be wondered at when we con∣sider the persecution which would have followed a faith unacceptable to the igno∣rance of the nations who were enveloped in superstition and bigotry and more particularly as these sages were in pos∣session of that valuable knowledge of the powers of nature of the qualities of matter and properties of things so dan∣gerous to be communicated to wicked and ignorant men from whose malevo∣lence the most horrid offences might be derived of which we may judge by the extraordinary and astonishing perform∣ances even of those impious and un∣enlightened men who contended with  MOSES in the miracles he performed under the immediate impression and in∣fluence of the Deity  Exodus ch vii ver Ch viii ver  MOSES divested the worship of the Deity of its cloak of mysteries and images and taught the Jews the know∣ledge of the God of the Universe un∣polluted with the errors of the nations of the earth and uncorrupted with the devices and ludicrous ceremonies insti∣tuted by the people of the East from whom he derived his first comprehension and knowledge of the Divinity  The Author of  the Dissertation on the an∣tient Pagan Mysteries  defending Dr Warbur∣ton's positions against Dr Leland writes thus  that to the  Pagan Divinity  there was not only an open and public worship but also a secret worship paid to them to which none were ad∣mitted but those who had been selected by pre∣paratory ceremonies called  Initiation  This secret worship was termed the  Mysteries  Of these there were two sorts the  greater  and the  lesser  according to the Bishop of Glou∣cester  the lesser taught by certain secret rites and shews the  Origin  of  Society  and the doc∣trine of a  future State  they were  preparatory  to the  greater  and might be safely communicated to all the  initiated  without exception  The  Arcana of the greater Mysteries  were the doctrine of the  Unity  and the detection of the errors of the vulgar  Polytheism  these were not communicated to all the aspirants without ex∣ception but only to a small and  select number  who  were judged capable of the  secret  The initiated were obliged by the most  solemn engagements  to commence a life of strictest piety and virtue it was proper therefore to give them all the encouragement and assistance necessary for this purpose Now in the Pagan world there was a powerful temptation to vice and debauchery the profligate examples of their Gods Ego homuncio hoc non facerem was the absolving formula whenever any one was resolved to give a loose to his passions This evil the  Mysteries  remedied by striking at the root of it therefore such of the  initiated  as were judged capable were made acquainted with the whole delusion The  Mystagogue  taught them that Jupiter Mercury Bacchus Venus Mars and the whole rabble of licentious Dei∣ties were only dead mortals subject in life to the same passions and infirmities with them∣selves but having been on other accounts benefactors to mankind grateful posteritie had deified them and with their virtues had in∣discreetly canonized their vices  The fabulous  Gods  being thus rooted the  Supreme Cause of all things  naturally took their place Him they were taught to consider as the  Creator  of the universe who pervaded all things by his virtue and governed all by his providence But here it must be observed that the discovery of this  Supreme Cause  was so made as to be consistent with the notion of local tutelary deities beings superior to men and inferior to God and by him set over the several parts of his creation This was an opinion universally holden by antiquity and  never brought into question by any Theist What the  Arcana  of the  Mysteries  overthrew was the vulgar  Polytheism  the worship of dead men  It was natural for these politicians to keep this a secret in the  Mysteries  for in their opi∣nion not only the extinction but even the gra∣dation of their false gods would have too much disconcerted and embroiled the established system of vulgar  Polytheism  From hence we may be led to determine that to Moses the secret of the  Egyptian Mythology  was divulged by his preceptors and the know∣ledge of the  only God  revealed to him divested of all the  symbols and devices  which engaged the  vulgar  The second stage of FREE MASONRY is grounded on this periodthe TEM∣PLE AT JERUSALEM owns the pro∣bation of the CRAFTSMEN  Moses was also possessed of knowledge superior to that of his Egyptian teachers through the revelations and inspirations of the Deityhe had acquired the com∣prehension of and was instructed to de∣cipher all the hieroglyphical characters  used by that people in their recordsit was no doubt a part of the original know∣ledge to express by characters to the eye the thoughts and sentiments of the mind but this was obscured and debased in after ages by symbols and hieroglyphics yet by the immediate dispensation of hea∣ven Moses attained the knowledge of those original characters by which he was enabled to reveal to his people and preserve to posterity the COMMAND∣MENTS OF GOD delivered to him on  the mount by inscribing them on tables of stone  Exodus ch xxxi ver  And he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of com∣muning with him upon Mount Sinai two ta∣bles of testimony tables of stone  written  with the finger of God  Ch xxxiv ver  And the Lord said unto Moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and I will  write upon these tables  the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest  Ver  And the Lord said unto Moses  write thou these words  for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel  It is natural to conceive that the Is∣raelites would be instructed in this act by which the will of the Deity was commu∣nicatedthey would be led to write the doctrines of their leader and his expo∣sitions of the law that they should be preserved to their childrenand if we give credit to the observations and con∣jectures of learned travellers the written mountains remain monuments of the pe∣regrinating Hebrews to this day  But to return to the progressions of our professionIt is not to be presumed that we are a set of men professing re∣ligious principles contrary to the revela∣tions and doctrines of the SON OF GOD reverencing a Deity by the denomina∣tion of the GOD OF NATURE and denying that mediation which is graci∣ously offered to all true believersThe members of OUR SOCIETY at this day in the third stage of masonry confess themselves to be CHRISTIANS  the veil of the temple is rentthe builder is smittenand we are raised from the tomb of transgression  I humbly presume it is not to be un∣derstood that the name of MASON in this society denotes that the origin or rise of such society was solely from buil∣ders architects or mechanicsat the times in which MOSES ordained the set∣ting up of the sanctuary  Exodus ch xxxi ver  See I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah  Ver  And I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workman∣ship  Ver  To devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass  Ver  And in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship  Ver  And in the hearts of all that are wisehearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded thee  Ver  The tabernacle of the congregation c  Ch xxxvi ver  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab and every wisehearted man in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the Lord had commanded  Ver  And Moses called Bezaleel and Aho∣liab and every wisehearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the Work to do it  and when  SOLOMON was about to build the TEMPLE at Jerusalem they selected from out the people those men who were enlightened with the true faith and be∣ing full of wisdom and religious fervor were found proper to conduct these  works of pietyIt was on those occa∣sions that our predecessors appeared to the world as architects and were formed into a body under salutary rules for the government of those who were employed in these great works since which period builders have adopted the name of ma∣sons as an honourary distinction and title to their professionI am induced to be∣lieve the name of MASON has its deri∣vation from a language in which it im∣plies some strong indication or distinction of the nature of the society and that it has not its relation to architectsThe French word MASON signifies a Family or particular race of peopleit seems as if the name was compounded of  QUERO SALVUM and the title of MASONRY no more than a corruption of  SUM IN MEDIO COELI or  SIGNA COELESTIA Job xxxviii which conjecture is strengthened by our symbols  The titles of masons and masonry most pro∣bably were derived from the greek language as the greek idiom is adopted by them and is  shewn in many instances in the course of this workthe Druids when they committed any thing to wri∣ting used the greek alphabetand I am bold to assert the most perfect remains of the Druids rites and ceremonies are preserved in the ceremo∣nials of masons that are to be found existing among mankindMy brethren may be able to trace them with greater exactness than I am at liberty to explain to the publicThe original names of masons and masonry may probably be derived from or corrupted of  res arcana mysteries and  sacris initiatus mystathose initiated to sacred mysteries  I am inclined to determine that the appellation of MASON implies a member of a RELIGIOUS SECT and a professed devotee of the Deity  WHO IS SEATED IN THE CENTRE OF HEAVEN  To prove these several propositions in MASONRY to be true and to demon∣strate to MASONS the importance of their order shall be the subject of the following lectures  The principles of MORALITY are rigorously enjoined us CHARITY  AND BROTHERLY LOVE are our in∣indispensable duty How they are pre∣scribed to us and their practice enforced will also be treated of in the following pages  My original design in these lectures was not only to explain to my brethren the nature of their profession but also to testify to the world that our MYSTE∣RIES are important and to take away the reproach which hath fallen upon this society by the vices ignorance or irre∣gularities of some profligate men who have been found among MASONS Should the errors of a few stain and render ignominious a whole society or bring infamy and contempt on a body of men there is no association on earth either civil or religious which might not be affected  LECTURE II  On the  Rites Ceremonies  and  Institu∣tions  of the  Antients  THERE is no doubt that our cere∣monies and mysteries were derived from the rites ceremonies and institu∣tions of the antients and some of them from the remotest ages Our morality is deduced from the maxims of the Grecian philosophers and perfected by the chris∣tian revelation  The institutors of this society had their eyes on the progression of religion and they symbolized it as well in the first stage as in the advancement of ma∣sonsThe knowledge of the God of  Nature forms the first estate of our pro∣fession the worship of the Deity under the jewish law is described in the se∣cond stage of masonry and the christian dispensation is distinguished in the last and highest order  It is extremely difficult with any de∣gree of certainty to trace the exact origin of our symbols or from whence our ce∣remonies or mysteries were particularly derivedI shall point out some antient institutions from whence they may have been deduced  The ASSIDEANS a sect among the Jews divided into  the merci∣ful and  the just the fathers and predecessors of the PHARISEES and ESSENESthey preferred their tradi∣tions before the written word and set up for a sanctity and purity that exceeded the law they at last fell into the error of the Sadduces in denying the resur∣rection and the faith of rewards and pu∣nishments after this life  The ESSENES  The etymologies of the names Essaei or Esseni i e  Essenes  are divers that which I prefer is from the Syriac  Asa signi∣fying  to heal or cure diseases for though they gave themselves chiefly to the study of the Bible yet with all they studied physic  Concerning the beginning of this sect from whom or when it began it is hard to deter∣mine Some make them as antient as the Re∣chabites and the Rechabites to have differed only in the addition of some rules and ordi∣nances from the Kenites mentioned Judg i and thus by consequence the Essenes were as antient as the Israelites departure out of Egypt for Jethro Moses's fatherin law as appears by the text was a Kenite but neither of these seemeth probable for the Kenites are not men∣tioned in scripture as a distinct order or sect of people but as a distinct family kindred or na∣tion Numb xxiv Secondly the Rechabites did not build houses but dwelt in tents nei∣ther did they deal in husbandry they sowed no seed nor planted vineyards nor had any Jer lv The  Essenes  on the contrary dwelt not in tents but in houses and they employed themselves especially in husbandry One of the  Hebrew doctors saith that the  Essenes  were Na∣zarites but that cannot be because the law enjoined the Nazarites when the time of the consecration was on to present themselves at the door of the tabernacle or temple Numb vi Now the  Essenes  had no access to the temple when therefore or from what author this sect took its beginning is uncertain The first that I find mentioned by the name of an  Essene  Josephus l xiii c was one Judas who lived in the time of Aristobulus the son of Jannes Hyrcanus before our Saviour's birth about one hundred years however this sect was of greater antiquity for all three pharisees Sadduces and  Essenes  were in Jonathan's time the brother of Judas Maccabeus who was fifty years before Aristobulus Certain it is that this sect continued until the days of our Saviour and after Philo and Josephus speak of them as liv∣ing in their times What might be the reason then that there is no mention of them in the New Testament I answer first the number of them seemeth not to have been great in Philo and Josephus's time about four thousand which being dispersed in many cities made the faction weak and happily in Jerusalem when our Sa∣viour lived they were either few or none Se∣condly  if we observe histories we shall find them peaceable and quiet not opposing any and therefore not so liable to reproof as the Pharisees and Sadduces who opposed each other and both joined against Christ Thirdly why might they not as well be passed over in silence in the New Testament especially con∣taining themselves quietly without contradiction of others as the Rechabites in the Old Testa∣ment of whom there is mention only once and that obliquely although their order continued about three hundred years before this testimony was given of them by the prophet Jeremy for between John with whom Jonadab was coeta∣nean and Zedekia chronologers observe the distance of many years Lastly though the name of  Essenes  be not found in scripture yet we shall find in St Paul's Epistles many things reproved which were taught in the school of the  Essenes  of this nature was that advice given to Timothy Tim v Drink no longer water but use a little wineAgain Tim iv Forbidding to marry and com∣manding to abstain from meat is a doctrine of devilsbut especially Coloss d in many pas∣sages the apostle seemeth directly to point at them Let no man condemn you in meat and  drink v Let no man bear rule over you by humbleness of mind and worshipping of angels v  why are ye sub∣ject to ordinances v The apostle useth the word  which was applied by the  Essenes  to denote their  ordinances aphorisms or constitutions  In the verse following he gives an instance of some particulars Touch not taste not handle not ver Now the junior company of  Essenes  might not touch their se∣niors and in their diet their taste was limited to bread salt water and hyssop and these ordinances they undertook  saith Philo for the love of  wisdom  but the apostle concludeth ver that these things had only  a shew of wisdom And whereas Philo termeth the religion of the  Essenes  by the name of  which word signifieth religious worship the apostle termeth in the same verse  voluntary religion or will worship yea where he termeth their doctrine  a kind of philosophy received from their forefathers by tradition St Paul biddeth them beware of philosophy ver  Godwyn's Moses and Aaron  were of very remote antiquity and it hath been argued by divines that they were as antient as the  departure of the ISRAELITES out of EGYPT They might take their rise from that dispersion of their nation which  happened after their being carried captive into Babylon The principal character of this sect was that they chose retire∣ment  were sober were industrious had all things in common paid the highest regard to the moral precepts of the law but neglected the ceremonial any further  than what regarded bodily cleanliness the observation of the sabbath and ma∣king an annual present to THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM They never asso∣ciated with women nor admitted them into their retreats By the most SACRED OATHS though they were in general averse to swearing or to requiring an oath they bound all whom they INI∣TIATED among them to the observance of piety justice fidelity and modesty to conceal the secrets of the fraternity preserve the books of their instructors and with great care commemorate the names of the angels They held that GOD was surrounded by spiritual beings who were MEDIATORS with him and and therefore to be reverenced Second that the soul is defiled by the body and that all bodily pleasures hurt the soul which they believed to be immortal though they denied the resurrection of the body as it would return the soul to sin Third that there was a great MYSTERY in numbers particularly in the number SEVEN they therefore at∣tributed a natural holiness to the seventh or SABBATH DAY which they ob∣served  more strictly than the other Jews They spent their time mostly in contem∣plation and abstained from every gratifi∣cation of the senses The ESSENES in∣troduced their maxims into the CHRIS∣TIAN CHURCH and it is alledged by the learned that St PAUL in his epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians particu∣larly censures the tenets of this sect  Of these ESSENES there were two sorts some were THEORICKS giv∣ing themselves wholly to speculation others PRACTICKS laborious and painful in the daily exercise of those arts or manufactories in which they were most skilful Of the latter Philo treateth in his book intituled Quod omnis vir probus of the former in the book following intituled De vita contemplativa  Godwyn's Moses and Aaron  The ESSENES were denied access to the TEMPLE  The PRACTICKS and THEORICKS both agreed in their aphorisms or ordi∣nances  but in certain circumstances they differed  The PRACTICKS dwelt in the cities the THEORICKS shunned the cities and dwelt in gardens and solitary villages  The PRACTICKS spent the day in manuel crafts keeping of sheep looking to bees tilling of ground c they were artificers The THEORICKS spent the day in meditation and prayer whence they were from a kind of excellency by Philo termed supplicants  The PRACTICKS had every day their dinner and supper allowed them the THEORICKS only their supper  The PRACTICKS had for their com∣mons every one his dish of watergruel and bread the THEORICKS only bread and salt if any were of a more delicate palate than other to him it was permitted to eat hyssop their drink for both was common water  Some are of opinion that these THEO∣RICKS were CHRISTIAN MONKS but the contrary appeareth for these reasons  In the whole book of Philo con∣cerning the Theoricks there is no men∣tion either of Christ or Christians of the Evangelists or Apostles  The THEORICKS in that book of Philo's are not any new sect of late be∣ginning as the christians at that time were as is clearly evinced by Philo's own words in calling the doctrine of the ESSENES  a philosophy derived unto them by tradition from their forefathers  In Grecian antiquity we find a festival celebrated in honour of CAERES  It was the most celebrated and mysterious solemnity of any in Greece whence it is often called by way of eminence the  Mysteries  and so superstitiously careful were they to conceal the  sacred rites  that if any person divulged any of them he was thought to have called down  some divine judgment upon his head and it was accounted unsafe to abide in the same house with him wherefore he was apprehended as a public offender and suffered death Such also was the secrecy of these  rites  that if any per∣son who was not lawfully initiated did but out of ignorance or mistake chance to be pre∣sent at the mysterious rites he was put to death The neglect of initiation was looked upon as a crime of a very heinous nature insomuch that it was one part of the accusation for which  Socrates  was condemned to death Persons convicted of witchcraft or any other heinous crime or had committed murder though in∣voluntary were debarred from these mysteries In later times certain institutions were made called the lesser mysteries and were used as preparative to the greater for no persons were initiated in the greater unless they had purified  at the lesser The persons who were to be ad∣mitted to the greater mysteries made their sa∣crifice a year after purification the secret rites of which some few excepted to which only priests were conscious were frankly revealed to themThe manner of  initiation  was thus the candidates being crowned with myrtle had ad∣mittance by night into a place called    i e  the  mystical temple  which was an edifice so vast and capacious that the most am∣ple theatre did scarce exceed it At their en∣trance they purified themselves by washing their hands in holy water and at the same time were admonished to present themselves with minds pure and undefiled without which the external cleanness of the body would by no means be accepted After this the  holy mysteries  were read to them out of a book called  which word is derived from  a stone be∣cause the book was nothing else but two stones fitly cemented together Then the priest that initiated them called  proposed cer∣tain questions to which they returned answers in  a set form  as may be seen in Meursius's Trea∣tise on this festival This done strange and  amazing objects presented themselves sometimes the place they were in seemed to shake round them sometimes appeared bright and resplen∣dent with light and radiant fire and then again covered with black darkness and horrorsome∣times thunder and lightning sometimes frightful noises and bellowings sometimes terrible appa∣ritions astonished the trembling spectators The  garments  in which they were  initiated  were ac∣counted  sacred  and of no less efficacy to avert evils than charms and incantations  The chief person that attended at the initia∣tion was called  i e  a revealer of holy things  The hierophantes had three assis∣tants the first of which was called from his office  i e  torchbearer  the second was called  or  the cryer  the third mini∣stred at the altar and was for that reason named    Hierophantes  is said to have been a  type  of the  great Creator of all things  "  of the  Sun  "  of  Mercury  "And  of the  Moon  "  at  Eleusis a town of Attica where the Athenians with great pomp and many ceremonies attended the mystic rites Historians tell us that these rites were a MYSTICAL representation of what the mythologists taught of that goddess and were of so sacred a nature that no less than death was the penalty of discovery  There was another great festival cele∣brated by the Greeks at PLATAEA in honour of JUPITER ELEUTHERIUS  the assembly was composed of delegates from almost all the cities of GREECE and the rites which were instituted in honour of JUPITER as the guardian of  LIBERTY were performed with the ut∣most magnificence and solemn pomp  In BALSARA and along the banks of JORDAN a sect of christians are known who call themselves CHRIS∣TIANS OF ST JOHN but as they pro∣fess no knowledge of the union of the third person in the TRINITY I am in∣duced to believe no part of our profession was derived from them Their ceremo∣nies and mysteries are founded on tradi∣tions and they permit no canonical book to be received amongst them  In the institution of the orders of KNIGHTHOOD the eyes of the foun∣ders were fixed on various religious ce∣remonies being the general mode of antient timesKnights of the Bath had their hair cut and beards shaven were shut up in the chapel alone all the night preceding their initiation there to spend the solemn hours in fasting meditation and prayer they offered their sword at the altar as devotees to the will of hea∣ven and assumed a motto expressive of  their vow "Tres in Uno" meaning the unity of the three theological virtues Various orders of Knights wear a cross on their cloaks the order of Christ in Livonia instituted in wore this ensign and were denominated brothers of the swordThe order of the Holy Ghost wear a golden cross  An antient writing which is preserved amongst masons with great respect re∣quires my attention in this place as it discovers to us what the antient masons regarded as the foundation of our pro∣fession  See the Appendix  This writing is said to have come from the hand of King Henry the Sixth who began his reign in it is in the form of an inquisition for the discovery of the nature of masonry  From this antient record we are told  that the mystery of masonry is a knowledge of nature and its opera∣tions  Appendix  "That this science arose in the East"  Ezekiel ch xliii ver  And behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the East and his voice was like the noise of many waters and the earth shined with his glory  Ch xxiv ver  The East gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the glory of the God of Israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut  Ver  It is for the Prince The Prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord  From the East it is well known learn∣ing first extended itself into the western world and advanced into EuropeThe East was an expression used by the an∣tients to imply Christin this sense we find  used in the prophets  That the Phoenicians first introduced this science  It is the opinion of many great antiquaries that the Druids were established in Britain before they gained any footing in Gaulto quote the authorities for this would render my work too prolix  In order to shew how early the maxims and principles of the eastern nations might be commu∣nicated to this land I must mention some obser∣vations of learned men  Arthur Agard Deputy Chamberlain of the Exchequer vide Bibl Cotton Faustina E V speaking of the admeasurement of lands in this country says  Our nation having their origin from the Trojans brought from thence the same order as was observed in that country our lands were measured by hides the etymo∣logy whereof is derived from Dido's act men∣tioned in Virgil the word hyda not being to be found in any other language but ours  It is the opinion of the learned Dr Stukely  that there is no doubt our first British ancestors were of the progeny of Abraham in the Arabian line by Hagar and by Keturah the Ishmaelites and Medianites who came hither with the Tyrian  Hercules to seek for tin  After naming many evidences and authorities to support this assertion he adds  and these matters mutually prove one another both that they came hither by sea from the coast of Phoenicia and that they brought the arts mentioned with them from the East  Admitting that there is merely a probability in these opinions it will follow that from thence the Druids would at once derive their theological principles and their religious ritesthe sacred groves the unhewn altars the stone pillars the consecrated circles emblematical of eternity were adopted from the manners of the Hebrews and the eastern nations  Appendix  That Pythagoras journey'd into Egypt and Syria and brought with him these mysteries into Greece  Appendix  It is known to all the learned that Pythagoras travelled into Egypt and was initiated there into several different  orders of priests who in those days kept all their learning secret from the vulgar He made every geometrical theorem a secret and admitted only such to the knowledge of them as had first under∣gone a fiveyears silenceHe is supposed to be the inventor of the th proposition of Euclid  The th proposition of Euclid which is at∣tributed to Pythagoras is contained in the first book and is as follows  THEOREM  In any rightangled triangle the square which is described upon the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares described upon the sides which contain the right angle  The DEMONSTRATION  In geometrical solutions and demonstrations of quantities this proposition is of excellent use and the example is held by us as a memorial of Pythagoras  for which in the joy of his heart it is said he sacrificed an hecatomb He knew the true system of the world revived by Copernicus  The record appendix also says that PYTHAGORAS framed a great Lodge at Crotona in Greecia Magna and made  many MASONS some of whom jour∣ney'd to France and there made MA∣SONS from whence in process of time the art passed into EnglandFrom whence it is to be understood that the pupils of this philosopher who had been initiated by him in the Crotonian school in the sciences and the study of nature which he had acquired in his travels dispersed themselves and taught the doc∣trines of their preceptor  From hence it would seem that our Druids received their origin in Gaul but antiquaries of late years have been of opinion that they origi∣nated in Britain  The same record appendix says that MASONS teach mankind the arts of agriculture architecture astronomy geo∣metry numbers music poesy chymistry government and religion  I will next observe how far this part of of the record correspondends with what PYTHAGORAS taught  The Pythagoric tetracties were a point a line a surface and a solidHis philo∣sophical system is that in which the SUN is supposed to rest in the center of our system of planets and in which the earth is carried round him annually being the same with the Copernican  It seems as if this system was pro∣fessed by MASONS in contradistinction to those who held the Mosaic system  Among the Jews were a set of men who were called MASORITES in Godwyn's Moses and Aaron this account is given of them  that their name was derived from  masar signify∣ing tradere to deliver and masor a tradition delivered from hand to hand to posterity without writing as the Pythagorians and Druids were wont to do  PYTHAGORAS lived at Samos in the reign of Tarquin the last king of the Romans in the year of Rome two hundred and twenty or according to  Livy in the reign of Servius Tullius in the year of the world three thousand four hundred and seventytwoFrom his extraordinary desire of knowledge he travelled in order to enrich his mind with the learning of the several countries through which he passedHe was the first that took the name of philosopher that is a lover of wisdom which im∣plied that he did not ascribe the pos∣session of WISDOM to himself but only the desire of possessing it  In Godwyn's Moses and Aaron treating of the  Essenes  we have the following comparisons between their principles and the maxims of  Pytha∣goras    Their  dogmata  their  ordinances  or  con∣stitutions  did symbolize in many things with Pythagoras's therefore my purpose is first to name  Pythagoras  's and then to proceed with the  Essenes  They follow thus  The  Pythagorians  professed a communion of goods so did the  Essenes  they had one com∣mon purse or stocknone richer none poorer than other Out of this common treasury every one supplied his own wants without leave and administred to the necessity of others only they might not relieve any of their kindred  without leave from the overseers They did not buy or sell among themselves but each sup∣plied the other's want by a kind commutative bartering yea liberty was granted to take one from another what they wanted without ex∣change They performed offices of service mu∣tually one to another for mastership and ser∣vice cannot stand with communion of goods When they travelled besides weapons for de∣fence they took nothing with them for in whatsoever city or village they came they re∣paired to the fraternity of the  Essenes  and were there entertained as members of the same And if we do attentively read Josephus we may ob∣serve that the  Essenes  of every city joined them∣selves into one common fraternity or college Every college had two sorts of officers trea∣surers who looked to the common stock pro∣vided their diet appointed each his task and other public necessaries others who entertained their strangers    The  Pythagorians  shunned pleasures so did the  Essenes  To this belonged their avoid∣ing of oil which if any touched unawares they wiped it off presently    The  Pythagorians  garments were white so were the  Essenes  white alsomodest not costly when once they put on a suit they never changed it till it was worn out or torn    The  Pythagorians  forbade  oaths  so did the  Essenes  They thought him a noted liar who could not be believed without an oath    The  Pythagorians  had their elders in sin∣gular respect so had the  Essenes  the body or whole company of the  Essenes  were distinguished in four ranks or orders according to their se∣niority and happily if any of the superior ranks had touched any of the inferior he thought himself polluted as if he had touched an heathen    The  Pythagorians  drank water so did the  Essenes  water only wholly abstaining from wine    The  Pythagorians  used inanimate sacri∣fices so did the  Essenes  they sent gifts to the  temple  and did not sacrifice but preferred the use of their holy water thereto for which rea∣son the other Jews sorbade them all access unto the  temple    The  Pythagorians  ascribed all things to fate or destiny so did the  Essenes  In this  aphorism all three jewish sects differed each from otherthe  Pharisees  ascribed some things to fate and other things to man's free will the  Essenes  ascribed all to fatethe  Sadduces  wholly denied fate and ascribed all things to mans free will    The  Pythagorians  the first five years were not permitted to speak in the school but were initiated per quinque male silentium and not until then suffered to come into the presence of or sight of Pythagoras To this may be referred the  Essenes  silence at table straightly observed so that decem simul sedentibus nemo loquiter invitis novemDrusius renders it that ten of them sitting together none of them spake without leave obtained of the nine When any did speak it was not their custom to interrupt him with words but by nods of the head or beckenings or holding their fin∣ger or shaking their heads and other suchlike dumb signs and gestures to signify their doubtings disliking or approving the matter in hand And to the time of silence among the  Pythagorians  that it must be five years may be referred the initiation of the  Essenes  for amongst them none were presently admitted into their  society without full trial and four years pro∣bationThe first year they received  dolo  ellum  a spade  Perezoina  a pair of breeches used in bathing and  vestem albam  a white garment which the sect affected At this time they had their commons allowed them but without not in the common dining hall The second year they admitted them to the participation of  holy matters  and instructed them in the use of them Two years after they admitted them in full manner making them of their corporation after they had received  an oath  truly to observe all the  rules and orders of the Essenes  If any brake his oath one hundred of them being as∣sembled together expelled him upon which expulsion commonly followed death within a short time for none having once entered this order might receive alms or any meat from other and themselves would feed such a one only with distasteful herbs which wasted his body and brought it very low Sometimes they would readmit such a one being brought near unto death but commonly they suffered him to die in that manner    The  Essenes  worshipped towards the  Sun  rising    The  Essenes  bound themselves in their oath to preserve the name of angels" the phrase implying a kind of worshipping of them    They were above all others strict in the observation of the  sabbath  dayon it they would dress no meat kindle no fire remove no vessels out of their place no nor ease nature yea they observed every seventh week a solemn pentecost seven pentecosts every year  From the great similitude in the principles of the  Pythagorians  and  Essenes  it seems as if they were derived from one origin varying in some few particulars suitable to the constitutions of the people and most probably they first sprang from Egyptian tenets and maxims  His maxims  of morality were admirable for he was for having the study of philosophy solely tend to elevate man to a resemblance of  the DeityHe believed that God is a soul diffused through all nature and that from him human souls are derived that  they are immortal and that men need only take pains to purge themselves of their vices in order to be united to the  DeityHe made unity the principle of all things and believed that between God and man there are various orders  of spiritual beings who are the ministers of the supreme willHe condemned all images of the Deity and would have him worshipped with as few ceremonies as possibleHis disciples brought all their goods into a common stockcontemned the pleasures of senseabstained from swearingeat nothing that had life and believed in the doctrine of a me∣tempsychosis or transmigration of souls  Some eminent writers deny that Py∣thagoras taught that souls passed into  brute animals Reuchlin in particular denies this doctrine and maintains that the metempsychosis of Pythagoras im∣plied nothing more than a similitude of manners and desires formerly existing in some person deceased and now re∣viving in another alive  PYTHAGORAS is said to have bor∣rowed the notion of metempsychosis from the Egyptians others say from the an∣tient Brachmans  LECTURE III  On the  Rites Ceremonies  and  Institu∣tions  of the  Antients  THE disciples of PYTHAGORAS were divided into two classes the first were SIMPLE HEARERS and the LAST such as were allowed to propose their difficulties and learn the reasons of all that was taughtThe figurative manner in which he gave his instructions was borrowed from the Hebrews Egyp∣tians and other orientals  If we examine how MORALITY or moral philosophy is defined we shall find that it is a conformity to those un∣alterable obligations which result from  the nature of our existence and the ne∣cessary relations of life whether to God as our creator or to man as our fellowcreatureor it is the doctrine of virtue in order to attain the greatest happiness  PYTHAGORAS shewed the way to SOCRATES though his examples were very imperfect as he deduced his rules of morality from observations of nature a degree of knowledge which he had ac∣quired in his communion with the priests of EgyptThe chief aim of Pythagoras's moral doctrine was to purge the mind from the impurities of the body and from the clouds of the imaginationHis morality seems to have had more purity and piety in it than the other systems but less exactness his maxims being only a bare explication of divine worship of natural honesty of modesty integrity publicspiritedness and other common offices of life  SOCRATES improved the lessons of PYTHAGORAS and reduced his maxims into sixed principles  PLATO refined the doctrine of both these philosophers and carried each virtue to its utmost height and accomplishment mixing his ideas of the universal prin∣ciple of philosophy through the whole design  The antient masonic record appendix also says that masons know the way of gaining an understanding of ABRAC On this word all commentators which I have yet read on the subject of MA∣SONRY have confessed themselves at a loss  ABRAC or ABRACAR was a name which BASILIDES a religious of the second century gave to GOD who he said was the author of three hundred and sixtyfive  The author of this superstition is said to have lived in the time of Adrian and that it had its name after ABRASAN or ABRAXAS the denomination which Ba∣silides gave to the DeityHe called him the SUPREME GOD and ascribed to  him seven subordinate powers or angels who presided over the heavens and also according to the number of the days in the year he held that three hundred and sixtyfive virtues powers or intel∣ligences existed as the emanations of God the value or numerical distinc∣tions of the letters in the word accord∣ing to the antient Greek numerals made Α    Β    Ρ    Α    Χ    Α    Σ      Amongst antiquaries ABRAXAS is an antique gem or stone with the word abraxas engraven on itThere are a great many kinds of them of various figures and sizes mostly as old as the third centuryPersons professing the re∣ligious principles of Basilides wore this gem with great veneration as an amulet from whose virtues and the protection of the Deity to whom it was conse∣crated and with whose name it was in∣scribed the wearer derived health pro∣sperity and safety  The annexed plate is from a drawing taken in the British Museum of a gem  deposited there is near twice the size of the original which is engraved on a beril stone of the form of an egg The head is in camio the reverse in taglio The head is supposed to represent the image of the Creator under the denomination of Jupiter Ammon  Jupiter Ammon  a name given to the  supreme Deity  and who was worshipped under the symbol of the  Sun  He was painted with  horns  because with the astronomers the sign  Aries  in the zodiac is the beginning of the year when the sun enters into the house of Aries he commences his annual course Heat in the Hebrew tongue  Hammah  in the prophet Isaiah Hammamin is given as a name of such images The error of depicting him with horns grew from the doubtful signification of the Hebrew word which at once expresses  heat  splendour or brightness and also  horns  The  sun  was also worshipped by the house of  Judah  under the name of  Tamuz  for Tamuz saith Hierom was  Adonis  and  Adonis  is gene∣rally interpreted the  sun  from the Hebrew word  Adon  signifying dominus the same as  Baal  or  Moloch  formerly did the  lord or prince of the planets  The month which we call June was by the Hebrews called Tamuz and the en∣trance of the sun into the sign Cancer was in the Jews astronomy termed  Tekupha Tamuz  the  revolution of Tamuz About the time of our Saviour the Jews held it unlawful to pronounce that essential name of God  Jehovah  and instead thereof read  Adonai  to prevent the heathen blaspheming that holy name by the adoption of the name of  Jove  c to the idolsCon∣cerning  Adonis  whom some antient authors call  Osiris  there are two things remarkable  the death or loss of Adonis and  the finding of him again as there was great lamentation at his loss so was there great joy at his finding By the death or loss of  Adonis  we are to understand the departure of the  sun  by his finding again the return of that luminary Now he seemeth to depart twice in the year first when he is in the tropic of Cancer in the farthest degree northward and secondly when he is in the tropic of Capri∣corn in the furthest degree southward Hence we may note that the Egyptians celebrated their  Adonia  in the month of November when the sun began to be farthest southward and the house of  Judah  theirs in the month of June when the sun was farthest northward yet both were for the same reasons Some authors say  that this lamentation was performed over an image in the night season and when they had sufficiently lamented a candle was brought into the room which ceremony might  mystically  de∣note the return of the  sun  then the  priest  with a soft voice muttered this form of words  Trust ye in God for out of pains salvation is come unto us  Godwyn's Moses and Aaron  the sun and moon  on the reverse the OSIRIS AND ISIS of the Egyptians and were used hierogra∣phically to represent the omnipotence omnipresence and eternity of God  The star  Our next inquiry is what idol was meant by  Chiun  and  Remphau  otherwise in antient co∣pies called Repham By Chiun we are to un∣derstand  Hercules  who in the Egyptian lan∣guage was called  Chon  By Repham we are to understand the same  Hercules  for Rephaim in holy tongue signifieth  gyant  By Hercules we may understand the planet of the  sun  There are etymologists that derive  Hercules  's name from the Hebrew  Hiercol  illuminavit omnia the Greek etymology    aeris gloria  holds correspondency with the Hebrew and both signify that universal light which floweth from the  sun  as water from a fountain Por∣phyry interpreteth  Hercules's twelve labours  so often mentioned by the poets to be nothing else but the  twelve signs of the zodiac  through which the sun passes yearly But some may question whether the name of  Hercules  was ever known to the Jews It is probable it  was for  Hercules was God of the Tyrians  from whom the Jews learned much idolatry as be∣ing their near neighbours It is apparent that in the time of the  Maccabees  the name was com∣monly known unto them for  Jason  the high priest sent three hundred drachmes of silver to the sacrifice of  Hercules  Mac iv The  star of Remphau  is thought to be the  star  which was painted in the forehead of  Molech  neither was it unusual for the heathen to paint their idols with such symbolica additamenta  Godwyn's Moses and Aaron  The Egyptian  Apis  was to bear such mark  seems to be used as a point only but is an emblem of PRUDENCE the third emanation of the Basilidian di∣vine  personThe scorpion  I own myself doubtful of the implication of these hieroglyphics I am inclined to believe the whole of them implied the tenets of the Egyptian philosophythat the  scorpion  represents  Egypt  being her ruling sign in the zodiac and that the  serpent  represents a religious tenet The learned Mr Bryant proves to us that it was adopted amongst the antients as the most sacred and salutary  symbol  and rendered a chief object of adoration in so much that the worship of the  serpent  prevailed so that many places as well as people received their names from thence  in hiero∣glyphics represented malice and wicked subtlety and the serpent  The corruptions flowing from the  Egyp∣tian philosophy  when adapted to  christianity  were these They held that the God of the Jews was the  Demiurgus  that to overthrow and sub∣vert the power and dominion of this  Demiurgus Jesus  one of the  celestial Aeons  was sent by the  supreme Being  to enter into the body of the man  Christ  in the shape of a  dove  that  Christ  by his miracles and sufferings subverted the kingdom of the  Demiurgus  but when he came to suffer the  Aeon Jesus  carried along with him the soul of  Christ  and left behind upon the cross only his body and animal spirit that the  serpent  who deceived  Eve  ought to be ho∣noured for endeavouring to rescue man from their slavery to the  Demiurgus  Key to the New Testament  an heretic  the implication whereof seems to be that heresy the subtleties and vices of infi∣dels and the devotees of satan were subdued by the knowledge of the true Godthe description I own myself at a loss how to decipher the characters are imperfect or ill copied  I have obtained two constructions of the in∣scription on the Abrax The one is  The earth shall praise thee  purporting the date of the sculptureThis date can have no relation to the christian aera Basilides existed in the earliest age of christianity and the ensignae with which the gem is engraven have relation most evidently  to the Egyptian philosophy which renders it probable this antique owes its creation to very remote ages The other construction without noticing the numerals is  Terra declarat lau∣dem magnificientiamque tuam  Both these gentlemen say the characters are very rude and imperfect  As to the numerals computing the date from the deluge it will relate to that remarkable aera of David's conquest of Jerusalem and settling the empire and royal seat there The descendants of Ham would probably take their date from the de∣parture of Noah's sons from the ark  The MOON with divines is an hieroglyphic of the CHRISTIAN CHURCH who compared I C to the SUN and the CHURCH to the MOON as receiving all its beauty and splendour from him  In church history ABRAX is noted as a mystical term expressing the su∣preme God under whom the Basilidians supposed three hundred and sixtyfive dependant Deitiesit was the principle of the gnostic hierarchy whence sprang their multitudes of thaeonsFrom A∣BRAXAS proceeded their PRIMOGAE∣NIAL  MIND from the primogaenial mind the LOGOS or wordfrom the logos the PHRONAESIS or prudence from phronaesis SOPHIA and DYNA∣MIS or wisdom and strength from these two proceeded PRINCIPALITIES POWERS AND ANGELS and from these other angels of the number of three hundred and sixtyfive who were supposed to have the government of so many celestial orbs committed to their careThe GNOSTICS  Of the gentiles who were converted to christianity the most dangerous and pernici∣ous kind were those who were infected with the  Egyptian philosophy  a system as it was then taught entirely chimerical and absurd The christians of this sort assumed to themselves the name of  Gnostics  a word of Greek extraction implying in it a knowledge of things much su∣perior to that of other men This word doth not occur in the New Testament but the  Ni∣colaitans  made mention of in the apocalypse of St John seem to have been of the  gnostic sect  and most of the errors maintained by  Cerinthus  and opposed in the gospel of St John may be derived from the same source When we say the gentile converts were chiefly liable to the  gnostic infection we must not be understood to exclude those of the jewish race many of whom were tainted with it but they seem to have derived it from the  Essenes  The main∣tainers of the Egyptian philosophy held that the  Supreme Being  the infinitely perfect and happy was not the creator of the universe nor the alone independent Being for according to them matter too was eternal The  Supreme Being  who resides in the immensity of space which they call  Pteroma  or fullness produced from himself say they other immortal and spiritual natures stiled by them  Aeons  who filled the residence of the Deity with beings similar to themselves Of these beings some were placed in the higher regions others in the lower Those in the lower regions were nighest to the place of matter which originally was an inert and formless mass till one of them without any commission from the Deity and merely to shew his own dexterity reduced it into form and order and enlivened some parts of it with animal spirit The being who at∣chieved  all this they called the  Demiurgus  the  operator artificer  or  workman  but such was the perverseness of matter that when brought into form it was the source of all evil The  Supreme Being  therefore never intended to have given it a form but as that had been now done he in order to prevent mischief as much as possible added to the animal spirit of many of the enlivened parts  rational powers  The parts to whom rational powers were thus given were the  original parents  of the  human race  the other animated parts were the  brute creation  Unluckily however the interposition of the Supreme Being was in vain for the  Demiurgus  grew so aspiring that he seduced men from their allegiance to the  Supreme Being  and di∣verted all their devotion to himself  Key to the New Testament  were a sect of  christians having particular tenets of faith they assumed their name to express that new knowledge and extraordinary light to which they made pretensions the word gnostic implying an enlightened person  The gnostic hierarchy here pointed out represents to us the degrees of ethe∣rial persons or emanations of the Deity This leads me to consider the hierarchy of the christian church in its greatest an∣tiquity which in the most remote times as a society consisted of several orders of men viz RULERS BELIEVERS and CATECHUMENS the rulers were bi∣shops priests and deacons the believers  were perfect christians and the catechu∣mens imperfect  Catechumens were candidates for bap∣tismThey were admitted to the state of catechumen by the imposition of hands and the sign of the crossTheir intro∣duction to baptism was thus singular Some days before their admission they went veiled and it was customary to touch their ears saying BE OPENED and also to anoint their eyes with clay both ceremonies being in imitation of our Saviour's practice and intended to sha∣dow out to the candidates their igno∣rance and blindness before their initiation They continued in the state of catechu∣men until they proved their proficiency in the catechistic exercises when they were advanced to the second state as believers  As the DRUIDS  Tacitus saith  among the Britains there is to be seen in their ceremonies and superstitious  persuasions an apparent conformity with the Gauls  Both nations had their  Druidae  as both  Caesar  and  Tacitus  evidence of whom  Caesar  thus recordeth "The  Druidae  are present at all divine service they are the overseers of public and private sacrifices and the interpreters of religious rites and ceremonies They are the preceptors of youth who pay them the highest honour and esteem They determine all con∣troversies both public and private In the cases of heinous offences murder or manslaughter they judge of the matter and give rewards or decree penalties and punishments They determine disputes touching inheritance and boundaries of lands If either private per∣son or body politic obey not their decree they debar them from religious ceremonies as ex∣communicate which is esteemed by this people as a grievous punishment Whoever are under this interdict are esteemed wicked and impious persons and are avoided by all men as fearing contagion from them they have no benefit of the law and are incapacitated from holding any public office Of the  Druidae  there is a chief who hath the greatest authority amongst  them at his death the most excellent person amongst them is elected as his successor but upon any contest the voice of the  Druidae  is re∣quiredsometimes the contest is determined by armsThey at a certain season of the year hold a solemn session within a consecrated place in the Marches of the Carmites near Charhes in France hither resort as unto the term from all parts all persons having controversies or suits at law and the decree and judgment there delivered is religiously obeyed Their learning and profession is thought to have been first devised in Britain and so from thence translated into France and in these days they that desire more competent learning therein go thither for instruction The  Druids  are free from tributes and service in war and like these immunities are they also exempt from all state impositions Many excited by such re∣wards resort to them to be instructed It is reported they learn by heart many verses They continue under this discipline for certain years it being unlawful to commit any of their doctrines to  writing  Other matters which they trust to writing is written in the Greek  alphabet  This order they have established I presume for two reasons because they would not have their doctrines divulged nor their pupils by trusting to their books neglect the exercise of the me∣mory This one point they are principally anxious to inculcate to their scholars that man's soul is immortal and after death that it passeth from one man to another They presume by this doctrine men will contemn the fear of death and be stedfast in the exercise of virtue Moreover concerning the stars and their mo∣tions the greatness of heaven and earth the nature of things the power and might of the Eternal Divinity they give many precepts to their pupils  From Pliny we learn  The  Druidae  for so they call their diviners wisemen and priests esteem nothing in the world more sacred than misleto and the tree which produces it if it be an  oak  The priests choose  groves of oak  for their divine service they solemnize no sacri∣fice nor celebrate any sacred ceremonies with the branches and leaves of  oak  from whence they may seem to claim the name of  Dryidae  in Greek Whatsoever they find growing to that  tree besides its own proper produce they es∣teem it as a gift sent from heaven and a sure sign that the Deity whom they serve hath cho∣sen that peculiar tree No wonder that misleto is so revered for it is scarce and difficult to be found but when they do discover it they ga∣ther it very devoutly and with many ceremo∣nies To that end they observe that the moon be just six days old for on that day their months and new years commence and also their several ages which have their revolutions every thirty years They call the misleto  allheal  for they have an opinion that it is an universal remedy against all diseases When they are about to gather it after they have duly prepared their sacrifices and festivals under the tree they bring thither two young bullocks milkwhite whose horns are then and not before bound up this done the priest arrayed in a surplice or white vesture climbeth the tree and with a golden bill cutteth off the misleto which those beneath receive in a white cloth they then stay the beasts for sacrifice pronouncing many orisons and prayers "  that it would please God to bless these his gifts to their good on whom he had be∣stowed them  "  were a set of re∣ligious peculiar to GAUL AND BRI∣TAIN  it may not be improper to cast our eyes on the ceremonies they used their antiquity and peculiar station ren∣der it probable some of their rites and  institutions might be retained in forming the ceremonies of our societyIn so mo∣dern an aera as one thousand one hundred and forty they were reduced to a re∣gular  body of religious in France and built a college in the city of Orleans They were heretofore one of the two  estates of France to whom were com∣mitted the care of providing sacrifices of prescribing laws for worship and deciding  controversies concerning rights and pro∣perties  In the greatest antiquity in antient Gaul and Britain they were elected out of the best families and were held both from the honours of their birth and office in the greatest veneration Their study was astrology geometry natural history politics and geography they had the ad∣ministration of all sacred things were the interpreters of religion and the judges of all matters indifferentlyThey had a chief or archdruid in every country They had the tutorage of youth and taught them many verses which they caused them to learn by heart without the assistance of writing in which man∣ner they instructed them in the mysteries of their religion the sciences and poli∣ticsAt the conclusion of each year they held a general festival and assembly in which they paid their adoration and offered gifts to the GOD OF NATURE bringing with them misleto and branches of oaks in mystic verses supplicating for approaching spring and the renewing  year At their sacrifices  I cannot quit the subject of the Druids wor∣ship without taking notice of the charge made against them by  Solinus  and  Dio Cassius  that they offered human victims or men's flesh in their sacrifices  If we examine this charge with candour we will not impute to them so great an offence against the God of Nature and Humanity as appears at first fight they were judges of all matters civil and religious they were the execu∣tors of the law as being the ministers of God to them was committed the administration of justice I shall admit that they used human sacrifices but those sacrificed were criminals were offenders against society obnoxious to the world for their sins and adjudged to be deserving of death for their heinous wickedness The great attribute of God to which they paid the most religious defe∣rence was justiceto the God of Justice they offered up those offenders who had sinned against his lawspunishments by death were of very early date and such punishments have never been esteemed a stigma on the states in which they were usedSuch executions by the Druids were at once designed as punishments and examples the utmost solemnity and the most hallowed rites preceded and prepared this tremendous exhibition  to impress on the minds of the spectators the deepest religious reverence and the utmost horror of the sufferings and detestation of the crimes for which they suffered were endeavoured to be instilled into the hearts of those who were present at this execution by the doctrine of the Druids The criminals were shut up in an effigy of wicker work of a gigantic size in whose chambers of tribulation they suffered an ignominious death by burningThis effigy represented the  Tyrian Her∣cules  whose name of Remphan in the Hebrew tongue implies a  giant  With him came the Phoenicians to this land from whom the Amo∣nian rites and Hebrew customs were taught to the Druids Under his name worship was also paid to the God of Nature symbolized by the  sun  In honour and commemoration of him the crimi∣nals were committed to his effigy as being deli∣vered up to the God of Justice  and in their religious offices they wore white ap∣parel and the victims were two white  bullsThey opened a sessions once a year in a certain consecrated place in which all causes were tried and de∣termined They worshipped one su∣preme God immense and infinite but would not confine their worship to temples built with human hands pro∣fessing the universe was the temple of the Deity esteeming any other incon∣sistent with his attributesTheir whole  law and religion were taught in verse Some Druids spent twenty years in learn∣ing to repeat those sacred and scientific distichs which it was forbidden to com∣mit to writing by which means they were withheld from the vulgar Such was the aversion and enmity entertained by the Romans against the Druids that as Suctonius says their rites were pro∣hibited by Augustus and totally abo∣lished by Claudius Caesar  Many probable conjectures have been made that the Phoenicians  When we speak of the  Phoenicians  we must distinguish the times with accuracy These people possessed originally a large extent of countries comprised under the name of the land of  Canaan  They lost the greatest part of it by the conquests of the Israelites under  Joshua  The lands which fell in division to the tribe of Asher extended to  Sydon  that city notwithstanding was not subdued If the con∣quests of Joshua took from the  Phoenicians  a great part of their dominion they were well paid by the consequences of that event In ef∣fect the greatest part of the antient inhabitants  of Palestine seeing themselves threatened with entire destruction had recourse to flight to save themselves Sidon offered them an Asylum By this irruption of the Hebrew people the Sidonians were enabled to send colonies where ever they thought proper  Sidon  lent them ships and made good use of these new inhabi∣tants to extend their trade and form settle∣ments From hence that great number of co∣lonies which went then from  Phoenicia  to spread themselves in all the country of  Africa  and  Europe  We may date this event about the year of the world two thousand five hundred and fiftythree and one thousand four hundred and fiftyone years before Christ  Spain was not the only country beyond the pillars of Hercules which the  Phoenicians  pene∣trated Being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean they extended themselves to the  left of the Straits of Cadiz as far as the right  Stabo  assures that these people had gone over a part of the western coast of  Africa  a little time after the war of Troy  We might perhaps determine their passage into England by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furnishes us with they are persuaded that all the  tin  that was consumed in the known world came from the  isles of Cassitorides  and there is no doubt that these isles were the  Sorlingues  and a part of  Cornwall  We see by the books of  Moses  that in his time  tin  was known in  Palestine Homer  teaches us also that they made use of this metal in the  heroic ages  It should follow then that the  Phoenicians  had traded in  England  in very remote antiquity  De Goguer on the Origin of Arts and Sciences  visited this  land in very early agesIt has been at∣tempted to be proved from the similarity of the habit worn and staff carried by the western BritonsThis staff was used by the Druids and has the name of Diogenes' staff In a description given by Mr Selden of some statues of Druids which were dug up at Wichtelberg in Germany it is particularly mentioned  The Phoenicians most probably intro∣duced to those teachers the laws and customs known amongst the antient He∣brews and specified in the Levitical in∣stitutionsThe altars or temples of the Druids and also their obelisks or monu∣ments of memorable events of which many remains are to be seen at this day bear the greatest similarity to those men∣tioned in the Old Testament Gen xxviii  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep  and said Surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not  Ver  And he was afraid and said How dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven  Ver  And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it  Ver  And this stone which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house  Exodus xx  And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast pol∣luted it  Exodus xxiv  And Mo∣ses wrote all the words of the Lord and rose up early in the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel  Ver  And he sent young men of the children of Is∣rael which offered burntofferings and sacrificed peaceofferings of oxen unto the Lord  Deuteronomy xxvii  And it shall be on the day when ye  shall pass over Jordan unto the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones  Ver  Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan that ye shall set up these stones which I command you this day in Mount Ebal  Ver  And there thou shalt build an altar unto the Lord thy God an altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them  Ver  Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones and thou shalt offer burntoffer∣ings thereon unto the Lord thy God  It was usual to give those places the name of the house of the Lord Chro xxii  This is the house of the Lord God and this is the altar of the burntoffering for Israel  This is said of the altar erected by David where afterwards the brazen altar stood in Solomon's temple  The oak  Diodorus Siculus  termeth the Gaulish priests  which betokeneth the  oak  Bryant  in his Analysis speaking of those who held the  Amonian  rites says  In respect to the names which this people in process of time conferred either upon the deities they wor∣shipped or upon the cities which they founded we shall find them either made up of the names of those personages or else of the titles with which they were in process of time honoured  He proceeds to class those and reduce them to radicals as he terms them and inter alias gives the monofyllable    Sar    Under the word  Sar  says he we are taught that as  oaks  were stiled  Saronides  so likewise were the antient  Druids  by whom the  oak  was held sacred This is the title which was given to the  priests of Gaul  as we are informed by  Diodorus Siculus  and as a proof how far the  Amonian  religion was extended and how little we know of drui∣dical worship either in respect to its  essence  or its  origin  Bryant's Analysis of Antient Mythology  Maximus Tyrius says  the Celts or Gauls worshipped  Jupiter  whose symbol or sign is the highest  oak  The Saxons called their sages  from the  Druids  was held sacred by the Druids under whose branches they as∣sembled  and held their solemn rites The oak and groves of oak were also held in great veneration by the Hebrews and other antient nations as appears  by Deuteronomy xii Judges vi Kings xviii Kings xxi Chron xv Deuteron vii and xvi Exod xxxiv Judges iii  Deuteronomy xii  Ye shall utterly de∣stroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their Gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree And ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place  Judges vi  The flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and he brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it  Kings xviii  And the prophets of the groves four hundred  Kings xxi  For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for Baal and made a grove as did Ahab King of Israel and wor∣shipped all the host of heaven and served them  Ver  And he set a graven image of the grove which he had made c  Chron xv  He removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove  Ver  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel  Deuteronomy vii  Ye shall all destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire  Cha xvi ver  Thou shalt not plant the grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God  Exodus xxxiv  But ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves  Judges iii  And the children of Israel c served Baalim and the groves  Isaiah i  They shall be ashamed of  the oaks which they have desired  The French Magi held the  or oak in great veneration  Plin Nat Hist  the Celtae revered the oak as a type or emblem of Jupiter  Maximus Tyrius  I have been thus particular on this sub∣ject as it encourages a conjecture that the Druids gained their principles and maxims from the Phoenicians as appears from those capital similarities before re∣marked  In the plain of Tormore in the isle of Arran are the remains of four circles By the number of the circles and by their sequestered  situation this seems to have been sacred ground These circles were formed for religious pur∣poses  Boetius  relates that  Mainus  son of  Fergus I  a restorer and cultivator of  religion  after the  Egyptian manner  as he calls it insti∣tuted several new and solemn ceremonies and caused great stones to be placed in form of a circle the largest was situated towards the south and served as an altar for the sacrifices to the immortal gods Boetius lib pa Boetius is right in part of his account the ob∣ject of the worship was the  sun  and what con∣firms this is the situation of the altar pointed towards that luminary in his meridian glory  Pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides  and thence it may be con∣ceived  they also received from them the doctrines of Moses and the original prin∣ciples of wisdom and truth as delivered down from the earliest ages  The oak hierogliphically represents strength virtue and constancy and some∣times longevityunder these symbolic characters it might be revered by the Druids and the misletoe which they held in the utmost veneration has excel∣lent medicinal qualities which in those days of ignorance might form the chief  of their materia medica being a remedy for epilepsies and all nervous disorders to which the Britons in those ages might be peculiarly subject from the woodiness of the country the noxious respiration proceeding from large forests the moi∣sture of the air from extensive unculti∣vated lands and the maritime situation of this country  From all these religious institutions rites customs and ceremonies which bear in many degrees a striking similarity to those of this society we may naturally conjecture that the founders of our pre∣sent maxims had in view the most an∣tient race of christians as well as the first professors of the worship of the God of Nature Our antient record which I have mentioned brings us positive evi∣dence of the Pythagorian doctrine and Basilidian principles making the founda∣tion of our religious and moral rules The following lectures will elucidate these assertions and will enable us I hope with no small degree of certainty to prove our original principles  LECTURE IV  The  Nature  of the  Lodge  I Now take upon me to prove my first proposition and to shew that the first state of a MASON is representative of the first stage of the worship of the true God  The LODGE when revealed to an entering mason discovers to him A RE∣PRESENTATION OF THE WORLD  The proportion of the measures of the  ta∣bernacle  proved it to be an imitation of the system of the  world  for that third part thereof which was within the four pillars to which the priests were not admitted is as at were an hea∣ven peculiar to  God  but the space of the twenty  cubits is as it were  sea and land  on which men live and so this part is peculiar to the priests only  When Moses distinguished the tabernacle into three parts and allowed two of them to the priests as a place accessible and common he denoted the  land and the sea  for these are accessible to all But when he set apart the third division for  God  it was because  heaven  is inaccessible to men And when he ordered  twelve loaves  to be set on the table he denoted the  year  as distinguished into so many months And when he made the  candlestick  of seventy parts he secretly intimated the decani or se∣venty divisions of the planets And as to the seven lamps upon the candlesticks they referred to the course of the  planets  of which that is the number And for the veils which were composed of  four things  they declared the  four elements  For the fine linen was proper to signify the  earth  because the flax grows out of the earth The purple signified the  sea  because that colour is dyed by the blood of a sea shell fish The blue is fit to signify the  air  and the scarlet will naturally be an indication of  fire  Now the vestment of the high priest being made of linen signified the  earth  the blue denoted the  sky  being like lightning in its pomegranates and in the noise of the bells resembling thunder And for the ephod it shewed that God had made the universe of  four elements  and as for the gold interwoven I suppose it related to the splendour by which all things are enlightened He also appointed the breastplate to be placed in the middle of the ephod to resemble the  earth  and the girdle which encompassed the high priest round signified the  ocean  Each of the sardonyxes declares to us the  sun and the moon  those I mean that were in the nature of buttons on the high priest's shoulders And for the twelve stones whether we understand by them the  months  or whether we understand the like number of the  signs of that circle  which the Greeks call the  zodiac  we shall not be mistaken in their meaning And for the mitre which was of a blue colour it seems to me to mean  heaven  for how otherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it That it was also il∣lustrated  with a crown and that of gold also is because of that splendour with which God is pleased  Josephus Antiq Jud cha  In another place Josephus says the candlestick was emblematical of the  seven days of creation and rest  The tabernacle set up by the Israelites in the desert may nevertheless give some ideas of the manner in which at that time the  Egyptian temples  were constructed I believe really that there must have been some relation between the taste which reigned in these  edifices  and the  ta∣bernacle  The  tabernacle  though only a vast tent had a great relation with architecture We ought to look upon it as a representation of the  temples and palaces of the East  Let us recollect what we have said before of the form of government of the Hebrews The Supreme being was equally their  God and King  The tabernacle was erected with a view to answer to that double title The Israelites went there sometimes to adore the Almighty and some∣times  to receive the orders of their sovereign present in a sensible manner in the presence of his people I think then we ought to look upon the tabernacle as a work which  God  would have that the structure should have relation with the edifices destined in the East whether for the worship of the  Gods  or the habitation of  Kings  The whole construction of the taber∣nacle presented moreover the model of an edi∣fice regular and distributed with much skill All the dimensions and proportions appeared to have beeen observed with care and perfectly well adapted  DE GOGUET  in which from the wonders of nature we are led to contemplate her great ori∣ginal and worship him for his mighty works and we are thereby also moved  to exercise those moral and social virtues which become mankind as the servants of the great architect of the world in whose image we were formed in the be∣ginning  The CREATOR designing to bless man's estate on earth hath opened the hand of his divine benevolence with good gifts he hath spread over the world  the illumined canopy of heaventhe covering of the tabernacle and the veil of the temple at Jerusalem were repre∣sentations of the celestial hemisphere and were "of blue of crimson and purple" and such is the covering of the lodge  Chron iii  And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon  See also Josephus  As an emblem of God's power his goodness omnipresence and eternity the lodge is adorned with the image of  the SUN  Besides what is already noted touching the  Amonian  rights and the worship of the  sun  the doctrine of the Magians was "the  Original Intelligence  who is the first principle of all things discovers himself to the mind and un∣derstanding only but he hath placed the  sun  as his image in the visible universe and the beams of that bright luminary are but a faint copy of the glory that shines in the higher heavens  It appears to the man studying nature that the  sun  is the most probable place in the universe for the  throne  of the  Deity  from whence are diffused throughout creation light and heat a subtle  essence  inexhausting and selfsubsisting convey∣ing or in themselves being the  operative spirits  which conduct the  works of God  through all the  field of nature  Psalm civ  Bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my God thou art very great thou art cloathed with honour and majesty  Ver  Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment  Ver  Who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind  Ver Who maketh his angels spirits and  his "ministers a flaming fire"  which he ordained to arise from the East and open the day thereby calling forth the people of the earth to  their worship and exercise in the walks of virtue  The great author of all hath given the MOON to govern the night a fit season for solemn meditation When the la∣bours of the day are ended and man's mind is abstracted from the cares of life then it is for our souls recreation to walk forth with contemplative mind to read the great works of the Almighty in the starry firmament and in the innu∣merable worlds which are governed by his will and thence to meditate on his omnipotence  O majestic  night  Nature's great ancestor day's elder born  And fated to survive the transient sun  By mortals and immortals seen with awe  A starry crown thy raven brow adorns  An azure zone thy waist clouds in heav'n's loom  Wrought thro' varieties of shape and shade  In ample folds of drapery divine  Thy flowing mantle form and heav'n throughout  Voluminously pour thy pompous train  Thy gloomy grandeurs nature's most august  Inspiring aspect claim a grateful verse  And like a fable curtain starr'd with gold  Drawn o'er my labours past shall close the scene  Young's Night Thoughts  Our thoughts returning  from this glorious scene towards our∣selves we discern the diminutiveness of man and by a natural inference confess the benevolence of that God who re∣gardeth us such minute atoms in the midst of his mighty works whose UNI∣VERSAL LOVE is thus divinely ex∣pressed  that not a sparrow shall fall without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered  When the world was under the hands of her great architect she remained dark and without form but the divine fiat was no sooner pronounced than behold there was light  Silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace  Said then th' omnisic word your discord end  Nor stay'd but on the wings of cherubim  Uplifted in paternal glory rode  Far into  Chaos  and the world unborn  For  Chaos  heard his voice him all his train  Follow'd in bright procession to behold  Creation  and the wonders of his might  Then stay'd the servid wheels and in his hand  He took the golden compasses prepar'd  In God's eternal store to circumscribe  This universe and all created things  One foot he center'd and the other turn'd  Round thro' the vast profundity obscure  And said thus far extend thus far thy bounds  This be thy just circumference  O world  Let there be  Light  said God and forthwith light  Ethereal first of things quintessence pure  Sprung from the deep and from her native east  To journey thro' the aery gloom began  Spher'd in a radiant cloud for yet the  Sun  Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle  Sojourn'd the while  Thus was the first day ev'n and morn  Nor past uncelebrated nor unsung  By the caelestial quires when orient  Light  Exhaling first from darkness they beheld  Birthday of heaven and earth with joy and shout  The hollow universal orb they fill'd  And touch'd their golden harps and hymning prais'd  God and his works  Creator  him they sung  Milton's Par Lost  creation was delivered  from darkness and the sun shot forth in∣stantaneous rays over the face of the earthHe gave that great constellation to the espousal of nature and vegetation sprang from the embrace the moon yielded her influence to the waters and attraction begat the tides  Remembering the wonders in the be∣ginning we claiming the auspicious coun∣tenance of heaven on our virtuous deeds assume the figures of the SUN and MOON as emblematical of the great LIGHT OF TRUTH discoverd to the first men and thereby implying that as true masons we stand redeemed from darkness and are become the sons of LIGHT acknowledging in our profes∣sion our adoration of him who gave LIGHT unto his works Let us then by our practice and conduct in life shew that we carry our emblems worthily and as the children of LIGHT that we have turned our backs on works of DARKNESS OBSCENITY and DRUN∣KENNESS HATRED and MALICE SATAN and his DOMINIONS prefer∣ring CHARITY BENEVOLENCE JUS∣TICE TEMPERANCE CHASTITY and BROTHERLY LOVE as the ac∣ceptable service on which the GREAT MASTER OF ALL from his beatitude looks down with approbation  The same divine hand pouring forth bounteous gifts which hath blessed us with the sight of his glorious works in the heavens hath also spread the earth with a beauteous carpet he hath wrought it in various colours fruits and flowers pastures and meads golden furrows of corn and shady dells mountains skirted by nodding forests and valleys flowing with milk and honeyhe hath wrought it "as it were in mosaic work" giving a pleasing variety to the eye of man he hath poured upon us his gifts in abundance not only the necessaries of life but also  wine to gladden the heart of man and oil to give him a chearful countenance  and that he might still add beauty to the scene of life wherein he hath placed us his highlyfavoured creatures he hath skirted and bordered the earth with the ocean for the wise Creator having made man in his own image not meaning in the likeness of his person but spiritually by breathing into his nostrils the breath of life and inspi∣ring him with that resemblance of the di∣vinity  AN INTELLECTUAL SPIRIT He skirted the land with the ocean not only for that salubrity which should be derived from its agitation but also that to the genius of man a communication should be opened to all the quarters of the earth and that by mutual inter∣course men might unite in mutual good works and all become as members of one society These subjects are repre∣sented in the flooring of the lodge  The universe is the TEMPLE of the Deity whom we serveWISDOM STRENGTH and BEAUTY are about his throne as the pillars of his works for his wisdom is infinite his strength is in omnipotence and beauty stands forth through all his creation in symmetry and order he hath stretched forth the hea∣vens as a canopy and the earth he hath planted as his footstoolhe crowns his temples with the stars as with a diadem and in his hand he extendeth the power and the glorythe SUN and MOON are messengers of his will and all his law is CONCORD The pillars supporting  the lodge are representative of these di∣vine powers  A LODGE where perfect masons are assembled represents these works of the Deity  We place the spiritual lodge in the vale of JEHOSOPHAT implying thereby that the principles of masonry are derived from the knowledge of God and are established in the JUDGMENT OF THE LORD the literal translation of the word JEHOSOPHAT from the Hebrew tongue being no other than those express wordsThe highest hills  At length to beautify those holy hills the places of the idolatrous worship they beset them with trees and hence came the consecration of groves and woods from which their idols many times were namedAt last some choice and select trees began to be consecrated Those French Magi termed  Dryadae  worshipped the oak in Greek termed  and thence had their names The Etrurians worshipped an holmtreeand amongst the Celtae a tall oak was the idol or image of  Jupiter  Among the Israelites the idolatry began un∣der the Judges Othniel and Ehud Judg iii and at the last it became so common in Israel that they had peculiar priests whom they termed prophets of the grove Kings xviii and idols of the grove that is peculiar idols unto whom their groves were consecrated Kings xxi Chron xv  Godwyn's Moses and Aaron  and lowest  vallies were from the earliest times es∣teemed sacred and it was supposed the spirit of God was peculiarly diffusive in those places  Ezekiel xliii  Upon the top of the mountain the whole li∣mit thereof round about shall be most holy  It is said in the Old Testament that the spirit of God buried Moses in a valley in the land of Moab implying that from divine influence he was in∣terred in such hallowed retirementOn Elijah's translation the sons of the pro∣phets said to Elisha  behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master least peradventure the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into  some valley  Hence was derived the "veneration paid to such places in the earliest ages and hence the sacred groves of the Easterns and DruidsThey chose those situations for their public worship conceiving that the presence of the Deity would hallow them they set up their altars there and shadowed them with groves that there as it was with Adam they might  hear the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden  In the corruption and ignorance of after ages these hallowed places were pol∣luted with idolatry  The vulgar losing sight of the emblematical signification which was not readily understood but by poets and philosophers took up with the plain figures as real divinities Stones erected as monuments of the dead became the place where posterity paid their venerations to the memory of the deceasedThis increased into a peculiarity and at length became an object of worship  Lord Kames's Sketches of Man  the unenlightened mind mistook the type for the origi∣nal and could not discern the light from darkness the sacred groves and hills  became objects of enthusiastic bigotry and superstitionthe devotees bowed down to the oaken log and the graven image of the sun as being divineSome preserved themselves from the corruptions of the times and we find those sages and select men to whom were committed and who retained the light of understanding and truth unpolluted with the sins of the world under the denomination of magi among the Persians wisemen south∣sayers and astrologers among the Cal∣deans philosophers among the Greeks and Romans bramins among the In∣dians druids and bards among the Bri∣tons and with the chosen people of God SOLOMON shone forth in the fulness of human wisdom  The MASTER of each lodge should found his government in CONCORD AND UNIVERSAL LOVE for as the Great Architect moves the systems with his finger and touches the spheres with harmony so that the morning stars to∣gether sing the songs of gratitude and the floods clap their hands amidst the invariable beauties of ORDER so should  we rejoicing be of one accord and of one law in unanimity in charity and in affection moving by one unchanging system and actuated by one principle in rectitude of manners  A MASON sitting the member of a lodge claiming these emblems as the testimonies of his order ought at that instant to transfer his thoughts to the august scene which is there initiated and remember that he then appears professing himself A MEMBER OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF THE UNIVERSE to obey the laws of the MIGHTY MAS∣TER OF ALL in whose presence he seeks to be approved  The antient record which I have before quoted expresses that the first masons received their KNOWLEDGE from God by which means they are endowed with the due understanding of what is pleasing to him and the only true method of pro∣pagating their doctrines  The few who remained uncorrupted with the sins of nations and who served  the ONLY AND TRUE GOD despised the fables and follies of idolaters others who were emerging from the ignorance and blindness in which they had been overwhelmed contemplated on the won∣ders displayed in the face of nature and traced the Divinity through the walks of his power and his mighty deedsCON∣TEMPLATION at first went forth ad∣miring but yet without comprehension from whence all things had their ex∣istence Contemplation returned glow∣ing with conviction that one great ORI∣GINAL of infinite power of infinite intelligence and of benevolence without bounds was the master of allThey be∣held him in his works they read his Ma∣jesty in the heavens and discovered his miracles in the deep every plant that painted the face of nature and every thing having the breath of life described his presence and his powerSuch men were afterwards made known to the en∣lightened and were united with them in the perfection of TRUTH  Thus as our noble author says through a long maze of errors man arrived at true reli∣gion  acknowledging but one Being supreme in power intelligence and benevolence who created all other beings to whom all other be∣ings are subjected and who directs every event to answer the best purposes  Lord Kames's Sketches of Man    As the servants of ONE GOD our predecessors professed the temple wherein the Deity approved to be served was not of the work of men's hands In this the Druids copied after themthe universe they confessed was filled with his pre∣sence and he was not hidden from the most distant quarters of creation they looked upwards to the heavens as his throne and wheresoever under the sun they worshipped they regarded them∣selves as being in the dwellingplace of the Divinity from whose eye nothing was concealedThe antients not only refrained from building temples but held it utterly unlawful so to do because they thought no temple spacious enough for the SUN the great symbol of the Deity "Mundus universus est templum solis" was their maxim they thought it pro∣fane  to set limits to the infinity of the Deity when in later ages they built temples they left them open to the hea∣vens and unroofed  The TRUE BELIEVERS in order to withdraw and distinguish themselves from the rest of mankind especially the idola∣ters with whom they were surrounded adopted emblems and mystic devices to∣gether with certain distinguishing princi∣ples whereby they should be known to each other and also certify that they were servants of that GOD in whose hands all creation existed By these means they also protected themselves from perse∣cution and their FAITH from the ridi∣cule of the incredulous vulgarTo this end when they rehearsed the principles of their profession they pronounced  that they were worshipers in that TEMPLE whose bounds were from the distant quarters of the universe whose height was no otherwise limited than by the heavens and whose depth was founded on that axis on which the revolutions of the starry zodiac were performed  The Egyptians were the first people known to us who in the early ages of the world after the flood advanced to any high degree of knowledge in AS∣TRONOMY ARTS AND SCIENCES these were the means of discovering to them the existence of the Divinity and they worshipped the author of those sub∣lime works which they contemplated but through national prejudices soon began to represent the attributes of the Deity in symbols and as the visible ope∣rations of his omnipotence were chiefly expressed in the powers of the sun and moon whose influence they perceived through all the field of nature they depicted the Deity by those heavenly bodies and at length under the names of OSIRIS and ISIS adored the GOD OF NATURE  Dr Owen divides the whole of idolatrous worship into  Sabaism  and  Hellenism  the  former  consists in the worship of the  Sun Moon  and  Stars  and the host of heaven which only is to my pre∣sent purpose which it is probable a few ages  after the flood had its beginning Dr Prideaux says  the true religion which Noah taught his poste∣rity was that which Abraham practised the worshiping of one God the supreme governor of all things through a  Mediator  Men could not determine what essence contained this power of  mediation  no clear revelation being then made  of the Mediator whom God appointed  be∣cause as yet he had not been  manifested  in the world they look upon them to address him by mediators of their own chusing and their no∣tion of the  Sun Moon and Stars  being that they were  Habitations of Intelligencies  which animated the orbs in the same manner as the soul animates the body of man and were causes of their motion and that these intelligencies  were of a middle sort between God and them  they thought these the properest things to be  Mediators  between God and them and there∣fore the planets being the nearest of all the hea∣venly bodies and generally looked on to have the greatest influence on this world they made choice of them in the first place as their Gods' mediators who were to mediate with the Su∣preme God for them and to procure from him mercies and favours which they prayed for  Herodotus  says that  Osiris  and  Isis  were two great deities of the  Egyptians  and almost the whole mythology of that antient people is included in what their priests sabled of them  Plutarch  con∣ceives that by  Osiris  the  Sun  is to be understood and this  Macrobius  confirms adding that  Osiris  in the Egyptian language signifies  manyeyed  and  Isis  the antient or the  Moon Osiris  according to  Banier  is the same as  Misraim  the son of  Cham  who peopled Egypt some time after the deluge And  Dr Cumberland  Bishop of Peterborough says  Misraim  the son of  Cham  grand child of  Noah  was the first king of  Egypt  and founder of their monarchy and that  Osiris  was an appro∣priated  title  signifying the  prince  and  Isis  is  Ishah  his wife  Diodorus Siculus  who has trans∣mitted down to us with great care the most an∣tient traditions of the  Egyptians  asserts this prince is the same with  Menes  the first king of  Egypt  Perhaps at his apotheosis his name was changed to that of  Isiris  according to some historians As the images of  Osiris  were very resplendent to re∣present the beams of light from the  Sun  so in their hymns of praise they celebrate him as rest∣ing in  the bosom of the Sun  From the authority of  Banier  and other histo∣rians we learn that the gods of the  Egyptians  were adopted by the  Phoenicians  that their  theo∣logy  was propagated  by the Phoenicians  into the  East  and in the  West  and some traces of them are sound in almost every  island of the Mediter∣ranean  In Syria we find the same  theology  the  sun  un∣der the name of  Adonis  and the moon of  Ashtaroth  The festival of  Adonis  is mentioned in Baruch chap vii  The priests of the city sat in their temples uncovered and shaven and mourn∣ing as at a feast for the  dead  The prophet complains that Solomon went after  Ashtaroth  and after Melcom the abomination of the Ammonites  The Chaldeans and Babylonians paid adoration to  Fire  and held the  Sabaism  worshipThe Per∣sians worshipped the  Sun and Fire  St Cyril writing on the  Pythagorian principles  says  We see plainly that  Pythagoras  maintained that there was  but one God  the original and cause of all things who enlightens every thing animates every thing and from whom every thing proceeds who has given being to all things and is the source of all motion  Pythagoras  thus defines the  Divinity    God  is neither the object of sense nor subject to pas∣sion  but invisible purely intelligible and su∣premely intelligent In his body he is like the light and in his soul he resembles Truth He is the universal spirit that pervades and diffuses itself over all nature All beings receive their life from him There is but one  only God  who is not as some are apt to imagine seated above the world beyond the orb of the universe but being all in himself he sees all the beings that inhabit his immensity He is the sole principle the light of heaven the father of all he pro∣duces every thing he orders and disposes every thing he is the reason the life and the mo∣tion of all beings  Plutarch  says  Osiris  is neither the  Sun  nor the  Water  nor the  Earth  nor the  Heaven  but whatever there is in nature well disposed well regulated good and perfect all that is  the image of Osiris  Seneca  the stoie says  'Tis of very little con∣sequence by what name you call  the first nature  and the  divine reason  that presides over the uni∣verse and fills all the parts of ithe is still the same  God  He is called  Jupiter Strator  not as historians say because he stopped the flying armies of the Romans but because he is the constant support of all beingsThey call him  Fate  because he is the first cause on which all others depend We stoies sometimes call him  Father Bacchus  because he is the universal life that animates nature  Hercules  because his power is invincible  Mercury  because he is the eternal reason order and wisdom You may give him as many names as you please provided you allow  but one sole principle  every where present    As we derived many of our mysteries and moral principles from the doctrines of PYTHAGORAS who had acquired  his learning in Egypt and others from the Phoenicians who had received the Egyptian theology in an early age it is  not to be wondered that we should adopt Egyptian symbols to represent or express the attributes of the Divinity  The Pythagorian system of philosophy also points out to us a reason for the figure of the SUN being introduced into the lodge as being the centre of the pla∣netary system which he taught as well as the emblem of the Deity which he served This grand  was a symbol expressing the first and greatest principle of his doctrinesThis was also  a representation of the  Abrax  which go∣verned the stellary world and our diurnal revolutions  In the books of Hermes Irismegistus who was an Egyptian and said to be contemporary with Abraham's grandfa∣ther is this remarkable passage speak∣ing of the Deity he says  But if thou wilt see him consider and understand the sun consider the course of the moon consider the order of the stars    Oh thou unspeakable unutterable to be praised with silence  From hence we are naturally led to perceive the origin of the Egyptian sym∣bolization and the reason for their adopting those objects as expressive of the might majesty and omnipresence of the Deity  The learned Dr Stukeley speaking of Stone∣henge says he took his dimensions of this monu∣ment by the Hebrew Phoenician or Egyptian cubit being twenty inches and threefourths of an inch English measure He dates this erection from the time of Cambyse's invasion of Egypt be∣fore the time of building the second temple at Jeru∣salem at an aera when the Phoenician trade was at its height and he presumes that when the priests fled from Egypt under the cruelties com∣mitted by that invader they dispersed themselves to distant parts of the world and introduced their learning arts and religion among the druids in Britain    Posterity to record the wise doctrines and religious principles of the first pro∣fessors of the true worship have adopted these descriptions of the lodge in which they assemble and maintain those reli∣gious  tenets which nature dictates grati∣tude to him under whom we exist and working in the acceptable service of him who rejoiceth in the upright man  As such it is to be a FREE MASON as such is A LODGE OF MASONS as such are the principles of this so∣cietyas these were the original institu∣tions of our BROTHERHOOD let the ignorant laugh on and the wicked ones scoffAnd that these are true solu∣tions of our EMBLEMS I am convinced myself and with humble deference to the rest of my brethren offer them for their attention  LECTURE V  The  Furniture  of the  Lodge  IT is with pleasure I pursue the duty I have imposed upon myself to give solutions of the MYSTERIES in MA∣SONRY which to minds inattentive to the real import of the objects in their view might remain undiscovered and the pro∣fessor of masonry might pass on without receiving a just sense of those dignities which he hath assumed  I have defined what is intended to be represented by a LODGE and its origin and nature it is now my duty to disco∣ver to you the import of the FURNI∣TURE OF A LODGE  As SOLOMON at JERUSALEM car∣ried into the Jewish temple all the vessels and instruments requisite for the service of JEHOVAH according to the law of his people so we MASONS as workers in moral duties and as servants of the GREAT ARCHITECT of the world have placed in our view those emblems which should constantly remind us of what we are and what is required of us  The third emanation of ABRAX in the Gnostic hierarchy was PHRONAE∣SIS the emblem of PRUDENCE which is the first and most exalted object that de∣mands our attention in the lodge it is placed in the centre ever to be present to the eye of the mason that his heart may be attentive to her dictates and stedfast in her laws for PRUDENCE is the rule of all VIRTUES pru∣dence is the path which leads to every degree of propriety prudence is the channel where selfapprobation slows for ever she leads us forth to worthy ac∣tions and as a BLAZING STAR en∣lightneth  us through the dreary and darksome paths of this life  VIRTUE by moralists is defined to be  that stedfast purpose and firm will of doing those things which nature hath dictated to us as the best and most sa∣lutarya habit of the soul by which mankind are inclined to do the things which are upright and good and to avoid those that are evil  In short virtue is moral honesty and good prin∣ciples  Of the VIRTUES of which PRU∣DENCE is the rule three are called Car∣dinal Virtues of which most properly a Mason should be possessed FORTI∣TUDE TEMPERANCE and JUSTICE for without these the name of MASON is an empty title and but a painted bubble  That FORTITUDE must be the cha∣racteristic of a mason I need not argue by which in the midst of pressing evils he is enabled always to do that which  is agreeable to the dictates of right rea∣son  TEMPERANCE also must be one of his principles being a moderating or re∣straining of our affections and passions especially in SOBRIETY AND CHAS∣TITYWe regard TEMPERANCE under the various definitions of moralists as constituting honesty decency and bash∣fulness and in its potential parts insti∣tuting meekness clemency and modesty  We profess JUSTICE as dictating to us to do right to all and to yield to every man what belongeth to him  The CARDINAL VIRTUES Pru∣dence Fortitude Temperance and Jus∣tice hold in their train the inferior powers of Peace Concord Quietness Liberty Safety Honor Felicity Piety and Cha∣rity with many others which were a∣dored by the antients in those ages when they confounded mythology with the worship of the DivinityWithin the starry girdle of PRUDENCE all the vir∣tues are enfolded  We may apply this EMBLEM to a still more religious importit may be said to represent the STAR which led the wise men to BETHLEHEM pro∣claiming to mankind the nativity of THE SON OF GOD and here conduct∣ing our spiritual progress to the author of REDEMPTION  As the steps of man are trod in the va∣rious and uncertain incidents of life as our days are chequered with a strange contrariety of events and our passage through this existence though sometimes attended with prosperous circumstances is often beset by a multitude of evils hence is the LODGE furnished with MOSAIC WORK to remind us of the precariousness of our state on earth today our feet tread in prosperity to∣morrow we totter on the uneven paths of WEAKNESS TEMPTATION and ADVERSITYWhilst this emblem is before us we are instructed to boast of nothingto have compassion and give aid to those who are in adversity to walk uprightly and with humilityfor  such is this existence that there is no station in which pride can be stably foundedall men in birth and in the grave are on the levelWhilst we tread on this MOSAIC WORK let our ideas return to the original which it copies and let every mason act as the dictates of reason prompt him TO LIVE IN BRO∣THERLY LOVE  As more immediate guides for a FREE MASON the lodge is furnished with un∣erring rules whereby he shall form his conductTHE BOOK of his law is laid before him that he may not say through ignorance he erredwhatever the great ARCHITECT of the world hath dictated to mankind as the mode in which he would be served and the path in which he is to tread to obtain his approbation whatever precepts he hath administred and with whatever laws he hath inspired the sages of old the same are faithfully comprized in THE BOOK OF THE LAW of MASONRY That book which is never closed in any lodge reveals the duties which the great MASTER of all exacts from us open to every eye  comprehensible to every mind then who shall say among us that he knoweth not the acceptable service  But as the frailty of human nature wageth war with truth and man's infir∣mities struggle with his virtues to aid the conduct of every mason the master holdeth the COMPASS limiting the dis∣tance progress and circumference of the work he dictateth the manners he giveth the direction of the design and delineateth each portion and part of the labour assigning to each his province and his order And such is his master∣ship that each part when asunder seem∣eth irregular and without form yet when put together like the building of the TEMPLE at JERUSALEM is connected and framed in true symmetry beauty and order  The moral implication of which is that the MASTER in his lodge fits dictating those salutary laws for the regulation thereof as his prudence directs assigning to each brother his proper province limiting the rashness of some and cir∣cumscribing  the imprudence of others restraining all licentiousness and drunken∣ness discord and malice envy and re∣proach and promoting brotherly love morality charity benevolence cordiality and innocent mirth that the assembly of the brethren may be with order har∣mony and love  To try the works of every mason the SQUARE is presented as the probation of his lifeproving whether his manners are regular and uniform for masons should be of one principle and one rank without the distinctions of pride and pageantry intimating that from high to low the minds of masons should be inclined to good works above which no man stands exalted by his fortune  But superior to all the LODGE is furnished with three LUMINARIES  The particular attention paid by the antients to the  Element of Fire  is in no wise to be won∣dered at when we consider that when ever the Deity deigned to reveal himself to the human sen∣es it was under this element  Exodus iii  And the angel of the Lord ap∣peared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed  Ver  God  called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses  Chap xiii  And the  Lord  went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of  fire  to give them light to go by day and night  Chap xix  There were thunders and  light∣nings  and a thick cloud upon the mount  Ver  And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the LORD descended upon it in  fire  Chap xviv  And the sight of the  glory  of the Lord was like devouring  fire  on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel  Chap xxix  And there I will meet with the children of Israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by  my glory  Numb ix  That thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pil∣lar  of fire  by night  Deuteronomy v  The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of  the fire  Ver  For ye were afraid by reason of the  fire  and went not up into the mount  Ver  These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the  fire  Ver  For the mountain did burn with  fire  Ver  And we have heard his voice out of the midst of the  fire  Ver  For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living  God  speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived  To these may be added the shachina in the temple  It would from a kind of parity in circumstances naturally follow that men would look up to the  Sun  as the  throne  of the  Divinity  from whence his ministring spirits dispensed his will to the dis∣tant quarters of the universe  Fire  became the general emblem of the Divinity in the  eastern na∣tions  was in great esteem with the  Chaldeans  and  Persians  The  Persians  used consecrated  fire  as the  emblem  of the  Supreme Being  to whom they would not build temples or confine the Divinity to space The  etherial fire  was preserved in the temple of the Jews and in the tabernacle with great reverence The druid priests in their wor∣ship looked towards the  Sun  they retained many of the Ammonian ritesthey are said to have made mystical processions round their  consecrated fires  sunwise before they proceeded to sacrifice    as the golden candlestick in the taber∣nacle of Moses was at once emblematical of the spirit of God whereby his chosen people were enlightned and prophetical of the churches or otherwise as Jose∣phus says representative of the planets and the powerful works of God so our  three LIGHTS shew to us the three great stages of masonry the knowledge and worship of the God of nature in the purity of Eden the service under the Mosaic law when divested of idolatry and the christian revelation or otherwise our lights are typical of the holy Trinity  Such is the furnitures of the lodge such are the principles dictated to us as masons let us rejoice in the exercise of those excellencies which should set us above the rank of other men and prove that we are brought out of darkness into lightAnd let us shew our good works unto the world that thro' our LIGHT so shining unto men they may glorify the GREAT MASTER OF THE UNI∣VERSE and therefore  do JUSTICE love MERCYand WALK HUM∣BLY with their GOD  Mus Brit  Tab  W  m  Hutchinson del  LECTURE VI  The  Apparel  and  Jewels  of  Masons  MASONS as one of their first prin∣ciples profess INNOCENCE they put on white apparel as an emblem of that character which bespeaks purity of soul guiltlessness and being harmless  We have the following passage in the Biographia Ecclesiastica  The antients were also wont to put a white garment on the person baptized to denote his having put off the lusts of the flesh and his being cleansed from his former sins and that he had obliged himself to maintain a life of unspotted innocency Accordingly the baptized are both  by the apostle and the Greek fathers frequently stiled  the EN∣LIGHTNED because they professed to be the children of light and en∣gaged themselves never to return again to the works of darkness  Isaiah ix  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined  This white garment used to be delivered to them with this solemn charge 'Receive the white and undefiled garment and pro∣duce it without spot before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ that you may obtain eternal life Amen'They were wont to wear these white garments for the space of a week after they were bap∣tized and then put them off and laid them up in the church that they might be kept as a witness against them if they should violate the baptismal covenant  Whilst the apron with which we are cloathed indicates a disposition of INNO∣CENCE and belies not the wearer's heart let the ignorant deride and scoff  on superior to the ridicule and malice of the wicked we will enfold ourselves in the garb of our own virtue and safe in selfapproving conscience stand un∣moved amidst the persecutions of adver∣sity  The raiment which truly implies the innocence of the heart is a badge more honourable than ever was devised by kingsthe Roman Eagle with all the orders of knighthood are inferiorthey may be prostituted by the caprice of princes but innocence is innate and cannot be adopted  To be a true Mason is to possess this principle or the apparel which he wears is an infamy to the apostate and only shews him forth to shame and contempt  That innocence should be the professed principle of a Mason occasions no asto∣nishment when we consider that the dis∣covery of the Deity leads us to the know∣ledge of those maxims wherewith he may be well pleased The very idea of a GOD is succeeded with the belief that  he can approve of nothing that is evil and when first our predecessors professed themselves servants of the architect of the world as an indispensible duty they professed innocency and put on white raiment as a type and characteristic of their conviction and of their being de∣voted to his willThe DRUIDS were apparelled in white at the time of their sacrifices and solemn officesThe Egyp∣tian priests of OSIRIS wore snowwhite cottonWe do not find that the priests of other nations noted for antiquity were singular in this except that in the service of CERES under whom was symbolized the gift of Providence in the fruits of the earththe Grecian priests put on white  Every degree of sin strikes the rational mind of man with some feelings of selfcondemnationUnder such conviction who could call upon or claim the pre∣sence of a Divinity whose demonstra∣tion is good worksHence are men naturally led to conceive that such Divi∣nity will only accept of works of righte∣ousnessStanding forth for the approba∣tion  of heaven the servants of the first revealed God bound themselves to max∣ims of purity and virtueand as MA∣SONS we regard the principles of those who were the first worshippers of the true God imitate their apparel and as∣sume the badge of INNOCENCE  OUR JEWELS or ornaments imply that we try our affections by justice and our actions by truth as the square tries the workmankship of the mechanicthat we regard our mortal state whether it is dig∣nified by titles or not whether it be opu∣lent or indigent as being of one nature in the beginning and of one rank in its close In sensations passions and plea∣sures in infirmities maladies and wants all mankind are on a parallelNATURE hath given us no superiorities'tis WIS∣DOM and VIRTUE that constitute supe∣riorityFrom such maxims we make estimates of our brother when his cala∣mities call for our council or our aid the works of CHARITY are from sym∣pathetic feelings and BENEVOLENCE acts upon the levelThe emblem of  these sentiments is another of the jewels of our society  To walk uprightly before heaven and before men neither inclining to the right or to the left is the duty of a Mason neither becoming an Enthusiast or a per∣secutor in religion nor bending towards innovation or infidelityIn civil govern∣ment firm in our allegiance yet stedfast in our laws liberties and constitution In private life yielding up every selfish propensity inclining neither to avarice or injustice to malice or revenge to envy or contempt with mankind but as the builder raises his column by the plane and perpendicular so should the Mason carry himself towards the world  To rule our affections by justice and our actions by truth is to wear a JEWEL which would ornament the bosom of the highest potentate on earth human na∣ture has her impulses from desires which are often too inordinate love blinds with prejudices and resentment burns with feverscontempt renders us incre∣dulous and covetousness deprives us of  every generous or humane feelingTo steer the bark of life upon the seas of pas∣sions without quitting the course of recti∣tude is one of the highest excellencies to which human nature can be brought aided with all the powers of philosophy and religion  Yet merely to act with justice and truth is not all that man should at∣tempt for even that excellence would be selfishnessthat duty is not relative but merely properit is only touching our own character and doing nothing for our neighbour for justice is an in∣dispensible duty in each individualwe were not born for ourselves alone only to shape our course through life in the tracks of tranquillity and solely to study that which should afford peace to the conscience at homebut men were made as mutual aids to each other no one among us be he ever so opulent can subsist without the assistance of his fellowcreatures Nature's wants are nume∣rous and our hands are filled with very little of the warfare of necessity our nakedness must be cloathed our hunger  satisfied our maladies visitedWhere shall the proud man toil for sustenance if he stands unaided by his neighbour When we look through the varied scene of life we see our fellowcreatures at∣tacked with innumerable calamities and were we without compassion we should exist without one of the finest feelings of the human heartTo love and to ap∣prove are movements in the soul of man which yield him pleasure but to pity gives him heavenly sensations and to relieve is divineCHARITY thus has her existenceher rise is from the con∣sciousness of our similarity in nature the level on which mortality was created in the beginningits progress is in sympa∣thetic feelings from the affections of the heart breathing love towards our brother coupled with the touch of original estima∣tion in our minds which proves all our species to be brethren of one existenceIts conclusion is from comparison producing judgment we weigh the necessities of our suffering fellowcreatures by our na∣tural equality by compassion our sym∣pathy and our own abilities and dispense our gifts from affectionPity and pain are sisters by sympathy  To be an upright man is to add still greater lustre to the Mason's character to do justice and to have charity are ex∣cellent steps in human life but to act uprightly gives a superlative degree of excellencefor in that station we shall become examples in religious in civil and in moral conduct It is not enough that we are neither enthusiasts nor perse∣cutors in religion neither bending to∣wards innovation or infidelity not to be in the passive only but we should appear in the active character we should be zea∣lous practisers observers of and stedfast members in religious dutiesIn civil matters we should not only submit to but execute the laws of our country obey all their ordinances and perform all their precepts be faithful to the consti∣tution of the realm and loyal to our king true soldiers in the defence of our liberty and of his crown and dignity In morality it requires of us not only that we should not err by injuring be∣traying or deceiving but that we should do good in every capacity in that sta∣tion  of life wherein kind Providence has placed us  By such meets let the MASON be proved and testify that his emblematical jewels are ensigns only of the inward man thence he will stand approved be∣fore heaven and before men purchasing honour to his PROFESSION and feli∣city to the PROFESSOR  LECTURE VII  The  Temple  at  Jerusalem  THE first worshipers of the God of nature in the nations of the east represented the Deity by the figures of the SUN AND MOON from the in∣fluence of those heavenly bodies on the earth professing that the universe was the temple in which the Divinity was at all times and in all places present  They adopted these with other symbols as a cautious mode of preserving or ex∣plaining divine knowledgebut we per∣ceive the danger arising from thence to religion for the eye of the ignorant the bigot and enthusiast cast up towards  these objects without the light of un∣derstanding introduced the worship of images and at length the idols of OSIRIS and ISIS became the Gods of the Egyp∣tians without conveying to their devo∣tees the least idea of their great archetype Other nations who had expressed the at∣tributes of the Deity by outward objects or who had introduced pictures into the sacred places as ornaments or rather to assist the memory claim devout attention and warm the affections ran into the same error and idols multiplied upon the face of the earth  Amongst the antients the worshipers of idols throughout the world had at last entirely lost the remembrance of the original of whose attributes their images were at first merely symbols and the second darkness in religion was more tremendous than the first as it was strengthned by prepossession custom bi∣gotry and superstition  Moses had acquired the knowledge of the Egyptians and derived the doctrines of truth from the righteous ones of the  nations of the east he being also touched by divine influence and thence truly comprehending the light from out the darkness taught the people of Israel the worship of the true God without the enigmas and pollutions of the idolatrous nations which surrounded them  This was the second aera of the worship of the God of natureand at this pe∣riod the second stage of masonry arises  The Ruler of the Jews perceiving how prone the minds of ignorant men were to be led aside by shew and ceremony and that the eye being caught by pomp and solemn rites perverted the opinion and led the heart astray and being con∣vinced that the magnificent festivals pro∣cessions sacrifices and ceremonials of the idolatrous nations impressed the minds of mankind with a wild degree of reve∣rence and enthusiastic devotion thought it expedient for the service of the God of Israel to institute holy offices though in an humbler and less oftentatious mode well judging that the service and adoration of the Deity which was only cloathed in  simplicity of manners and humble prayer must be established in the judgment and conviction of the heart of man with which ignorance was ever waging war  In succeeding ages SOLOMON built A TEMPLE for the service of God and ordained its rights and ceremonies to be performed with a splendour equal to the most extravagant pomp of the idolaters  As this TEMPLE  Ezekiel xliv  The east gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut  Ver  It is for the prince the prince shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord  Ver  Then brought he me by the way of the north gate before the house  received the se∣cond race of the servants of the true God and as the true CRAFTSMEN were here proved in their work I will crave your attention to the circumstances which are to be gathered from holy writ and from historians touching this structure as an illustration of those secrets in ma∣sonry which may appear to my bre∣thren  dark or insignificant unless they are proved from thence  In the first book of Kings we are told that  HIRAM King of Tyre sent his servants unto SOLOMON and SO∣LOMON sent to HIRAM saying Behold I intend to build an house unto the name of the Lord my GodAnd SOLOMON raised a levy out of all Israel and the levy was thirty thousand menAnd he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in Lebanon and two months at home and Adoniram was over the levyAnd SOLOMON had threescore and ten thousand that bare burthens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountainsbesides the chief of SOLOMON'S officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people which wrought in the work And the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the houseAnd SOLOMON's builders and HIRAM's builders did hew them  and the stonesquarers or GIBILITES In the fourth year was the founda∣tion of the house laid and in the eleventh year was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it And King SOLOMON sent and fetched HIRAM out of Tyre He was a wi∣dow's son of the tribe of Napthali and his father was a man of Tyre a worker in brassHe cast two pillars of brass with two chapiters which were of lilywork and he set up the pillars in the porch of the TempleAnd he set up the right pillar and he called the name thereof JACHIN and he set up the left pillar and called it BOAZ  In the second book of Chronicles we read that  he set three hundred and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burthens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a workAnd SOLOMON sent to HI∣RAM King of Tyre to send him a man cunning to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in purple in crimson and in blue and skilful in  engravingsAnd Hiram sent unto him a cunning man endowed with the un∣derstanding of Hiram his fatherAnd he made the veil of the temple of blue purple crimson and fine linenAnd he made before the house two pillars and called the name of that on the right hand JACHIN and that on the left BOAZ  The raising  pillars and obelisks  was a custom of the eastern nations and of  Egypt  in particular the use of which we are told was to  record  the  extent of dominion  and the  tributes of nations  sub∣ject to the Egyptian empire c or in  comme∣moration of memorable eventsDiodorus  tells us that  Sosostris  signalized his reign by the erection of two obelisks which were cut with a design to acquaint postertity of the extent of his power and the number of nations he had conquered Augustus according to the report of  Pliny  tran∣sported one of these obelisks to Rome and placed it in the Campus Martius  Pliny  says the Egyptians were the first devisers of such monu∣ments and that  Mestres  king of Heliopolis erected the first  Marsham  and others attribute the in∣vention to  Jesostris  The obelisk of  Shannesses  exceeded all that had preceded it  Constantine  and  Constans  his son caused it to be moved to Rome where it remains the noblest piece of Egyp∣tian  antiquity existing in the world  Solomon  had pursued this custom in erecting his pillars in the porch of the Temple which he designed should be a memorial to the Jews as they entered the holy place to warm their minds with confidence and faith by this record of the promises made by the Lord unto his father David and which were re∣peated unto him in a vision in which the voice of God proclaimed Kings ix  I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever    When this splendid structure was fi∣nish'd  SOLOMON stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of ISRAEL and spread forth his hands and said O LORD GOD of Israel there is no God like thee in the heaven and in the earthO LORD MY GOD hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before theeO LORD GOD turn not away the face of thine anointed  In the conduct of this great work we must admire the sagacity of this pious architecthe discerned the necessity there was to assign to portions of his people  the particular labour they were to pur∣sue he gave them particular signs and secret tokens  These were meant for the better conduct of the work and were totally abstracted from those other principles which were the foundation of our professionthey were manual proofs of the part each was stationed to performthe light which had possess'd the soul and which was the first principle was in no wise to be distinguished by such signs and tokens or revealed expressed or  communicated  thereby  by which each rank should be distinguished in order that the whole might proceed with propriety and without confusionhe selected those of most enlightened minds and comprehen∣sive understandings religious men piously zealous in good works as masters to su∣perintend the workmen men skilful in geometry and proportions who had been initiated and proved in the mystical learn∣ing of the antient sages those he made overseers of the workthe whole was conducted with that degree of holy reve∣rence that even the noise of a tool or in∣strument was not permitted to disturb the sacred silence on MORIALI sancti∣fied by the presence of the Almighty and  by his miraculous worksWas it not rea∣sonable then to conceive under this exalted degree of pious attention that no part of this structure was to be formed but by men of pure hands and holy minds who had professed themselves devoted to the service of the true God and had enrolled themselves under the banner of true reli∣gion and virtueAs the sons of Aaron alone were admitted to the holy offices and to the sacrificial rites so none but devotees were admitted to this labour On this stage we see those Religious who had received the truth and the light of understanding as possessed by the first men embodied as artificers and enga∣ged in this holy work as architects This together with the construction of the tabernacle under Moses are the first in∣stances of our predecessors being exhibited to the world as builders for altho' it is not to be doubted the sages amongst the Hebrews Egyptians Persians Chaldeans Greeks Romans Bramins Druids and Bards understood geometry and the rules of proportion and numbers yet we have no evidence of their being the actual exe∣cutors of any plan in architecture and  yet without question they were the pro∣jectors and superintendants of such works in every age and nation  Without such regulations as Solomon had devised for the government of his servants without such artificers and a superior wisdom overruling the whole we should be at a loss to account for the beginning carrying on and finishing that great work in the space of seven years and six months when the two succeeding temples though much infe∣rior employed so much more time and when we have good authority to believe that the temple of Diana at Ephesus a structure not comparable to the temple at Jerusalem was two hundred and twenty years in building  The building being conducted by a set of Religious makes it natural to conceive that from devotion and pious fervor as well as emulation those employed had unceasing motives to prompt their dili∣gence and preserve harmony and order as their labour was probationary and led to an advancement to superior privileges  higher points of knowledge and at the last to that honourable preeminence of a MASTER of the holy work  SOLOMON himself was an extraordi∣nary personage and his wisdom and mag∣nificence had gained him the wonder and attention of the neighbouring nations but this splendid structure the wonder of the earth thus raised by the pious hands of men labouring in the worship and ser∣vice of the God of Israel would of con∣sequence extend his fame and attract the admiration of the more distant parts of the worldhis name and his artificers would become the wonder of mankind and his works their example and emula∣tion from thence the MASONS of SOLOMON would be dispersed into dif∣ferent states to superintend the works of other princes and there would convert insidels initiate brethren in their myste∣ries and extend their order over the dis∣tant quarters of the known world  We find that the like distinction was retained on rebuilding the temple in the reign of Cyrus and that the work was  performed by the religious of the Is∣raelites and not by ordinary mechanics for they refused to admit the Samaritans to a share of the work although they petitioned it under the denomination of servants of the same Godbut they were rejected as unworthy of the works of piety and unacceptable to the God of Israel for though they professed them∣selves to be servants of the true God they polluted their worship by idols  JOSEPHUS in his History of the An∣tiquities of the Jews speaking of SOLO∣MON's going about to erect the Temple at JERUSALEM gives copies of the epistles which passed between SOLOMON and HIRAM of Tyre on that matter and which he says remained in his days pre∣served in their books and amongst the Tyrians also  Eusebius preparat Evanget ix has these letters though greatly disguised by Eupole∣meus from whom Eusebius had his copies  which epistles are as fol∣low  SOLOMON to KING HIRAM  Know thou that my father would have built a temple to God but was hindred by wars and continual expedi∣tions for he did not leave off to over∣throw his enemies till he made them all subject to tributeBut I give thanks to God for the peace I at pre∣sent enjoy and on that account I am at leisure and design to build an house to God for God foretold to my father that such an house should be built by meWherefore I desire thee to send some of thy subjects with mine to Mount Lebanon to cut down timber for the Sidonians are more skilful than our people in cutting of woodas for wages for the hewers of wood I will pay whatsoever price thou shall deter∣mine  HIRAM to KING SOLOMON  There is reason to bless God that he hath committed thy father's govern∣ment to thee who art a wise man and endowed with all virtuesAs for my∣self  I rejoice at the condition thou art in and will be subservient to thee in all thou requirestfor when by my servants I have cut down many and large trees of Cedar and Cypress wood I will send them to sea and will order my subjects to make floats of them and to sail to what place soever of thy country thou shalt desire and leave them there after which thy ser∣vants may carry them to Jerusalem but do thou take care to procure corn for this timber which we stand in need of because we inhabit an island  JOSEPHUS speaking of the progress of the building says  Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre whose name was Hiram by birth of the tribe of Naphthali on the mother's sideThis man was skilful in all sorts of works but his chief skill lay in working in gold in silver and brass the one of the pillars which he set at the entrance of the porch at the right hand he called JACHIN and the other at the left hand he called BOAZ  SOLOMON was wise in all the learn∣ing  of the antients he was possessed of all the mystical knowledge of the eastern nations and to perfect the same was enlightened by the immediate gift of hea∣venIt was also the mode and manners of the times in which the temple of Je∣rusalem was erected to use emblemati∣cal and symbolic ornaments in the public edifices a fashion derived from the hie∣roglyphic monuments of the Egyptians and the mysterious mode in which their sages concealed their wisdom and learn∣ing from the vulgar eye and communi∣cated science to those of their own order only  The pillars erected at the porch of the temple were not only ornamental but also carried with them an emblematical import in their names BOAZ being in its literal translation IN THEE IS STRENGTH and JACHIN IT SHALL BE ESTABLISHED which by a very natural transposition may be put thus O LORD THOU ART MIGHTY AND THY POWER IS ESTABLISHED FROM EVERLASTING TO EVER∣LASTINGOr otherwise they might  imply as BOAZ was the father of DA∣VID THE HOUSE OF DAVID SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOR EVER I am justified in this latter appli∣cation by the express words of NA∣THAN the prophet unto DAVID in∣spired by the vision of the Lord  Sam vii  And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom  Ver  He shall build an house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever  Ver  And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee THY THRONE SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOR EVER  In commemoration of this great PRO∣MISE to the faithful we ornament the entrance into our LODGES with these EMBLEMATICAL PILLARS from our knowledge of the completion of that sacred sentence accomplished in the com∣ing of our REDEEMER  LECTURE VIII  On  Geometry  IT is now incumbent upon me to de∣monstrate to you the great signification of the letter G wherewith lodges and the medals of masons are ornamented  To apply its signification to the name of GOD only is depriving it of part of its MASONIC import although I have already shewn that the symbols used in lodges are expressive of the Divinity's be∣ing the great object of Masonry as archi∣tect of the world  This significant letter denotes GEO∣METRY which to artificers is the sci∣ence  by which all their labours are calcu∣lated and formed and to Masons con∣tains the determination definition and proof of the order beauty and wonder∣ful wisdom of the power of God in his creation  GEOMETRY is said originally to have signified nothing more than the art of measuring the earth or any distances or dimensions within it but at present it denotes the science of magnitude in general comprehending the doctrine and relations of whatsoever is susceptible of augmentation or diminution So to geometry may be referred the construc∣tion not only of lines superficies and solids but also of time velocity num∣bers weight and many other matters  This is a science which is said to have its rise or at least its present rules from the Egyptians who by nature were un∣der a necessity of using it to remedy the confusion which generally happened in their lands by the overflowing of the Nile which carried away yearly all  boundaries and effaced all limits of their possessions Thus this science which con∣sisted only in its first steps of the means of measuring lands that every person might have his property restored to him was called geometry or the art of measuring land and it is probable that the draughts and schemes the Egyptians were annually compelled to make helped them to dis∣cover many excellent properties of those figures and which speculation continu∣ally occasioned to be improved  From Egypt GEOMETRY passed into Greece where it continued to receive new improvements in the hands of THALES PYTHAGORAS ARCHI∣MEDES EUCLID and others the ele∣ments of geometry which were written by Euclid testify to us the great perfec∣tion to which this science was brought by the antients though much inferior to modern geometry The bounds of which by the invention of fluxions and the discovery of an infinite order of curves are greatly enlarged  The usefulness of geometry extends to almost every art and scienceby the help of it astronomers turn their obser∣vations to advantage regulate the dura∣tion of times seasons years cycles and epochas and measure the distance mo∣tions and magnitude of the heavenly bodies It is by this science that geo∣graphers determine the figure and mag∣nitude of the whole earth and delineate the extent and bearings of kingdoms provinces oceans harbours and every place upon the globe It is adapted to artificers in every branch and from thence as I said before architects derive their measures justnesses and proportions  This naturally leads me to conjecture why the SQUARE is had by masons as one of the LIGHTS of MASONRY and part of the furniture of the LODGE To explain my ideas on that matter I will only repeat to you the words of a celebrated author treating of the rise and progress of sciencesHe says  We find nothing in antient authors to di∣rect  us to the exact order in which the fundamental principles of measuring surfaces were discovered They pro∣bably began with those surfaces which terminated by right lines and amongst these with the most simpleIt is hard indeed to determine which of those surfaces which are terminated by a small number of right lines are the most simpleIf we were to judge by the number of sides the triangle has indisputably the advantageyet I am inclined to think that the square was the figure which first engaged the at∣tention of geometriciansIt was not till some time after this that they began to examine equilateral triangles which are the most regular of all trian∣gular figuresIt is to be presumed that they understood that rectilinear figure first to which they afterwards compared the areas of other polygons as they discovered themIt was by that means the square became the com∣mon measure of all surfacesfor of all ages and amongst all nations of which we have any knowledge the square has always been that in planimetry  which the unit is in arithmetic for though in measuring rectilinear figures we are obliged to resolve them into triangles yet the areas of these figures are always given in the square  Thence I am led to determine that the square was the first and original figure in geometry and as such was introduced to our lodges  The square was the figure under which the Israelites formed their encampments in the wilderness and under which they fortified or defended the holy tabernacle sanctified with the immediate presence of the Divinity  As I before declared it to be my opi∣nion that this society was never formed for or of a set of working architects or masons but as a religious social and charitable establishment and never were embodied or exhibited to the world as builders save only under Moses and at the Temple at Jerusalem where with holy hands they executed those works of piety as the patriarchs erected altars to the ho∣nor of the Divinity for their sacrifices and  religious offices  Genesis iv viii xxii xxviii xxxiii xxxi  Exodus xx xxvii xxx  Joshua xxii  so I am persuaded that the adoption of geometry by masons or any emblem of that science implies no more than a reverence for such device of the mind of man as should demon∣strate the wisdom of the Almighty in his works whereby the powers of Abrax are defined and the system of the starry re∣volutions in the heavens determined  If we should look upon the earth with its produce the ocean with its tides the coming and passing of day the starry arch of heaven the seasons and their changes the life and death of man as being merely accidents in the hand of nature we must shut up all the powers of judgment and yield our∣selves to the darkest folly and igno∣ranceThe august scene of the planetary system the day and night the seasons in their successions the animal frame the vegetation of plants all afford us subject  for astonishment the greater too mighty but for the hand of a Deity whose works they arethe least too miraculous but for the wisdom of their God  Then how much ought we to esteem that science through whose powers it is given to man to discover the order of the heavenly bodies their revolutions and their stations thereby resolving the opera∣tions of the Deity to an unerring system proving the mightiness of his works and the wisdom of his decrees  It is no wonder then that the first insti∣tutors of this society who had their eye on the revelation of the Deity from the ear∣liest ages of the world unto the days of its perfection under the ministry of the Son of God that they should hold that science hallowed amongst them whereby such lights were obtained by man in the discovery of the great wisdom of the Creator in the beginning  LECTURE IX  The  Master Mason's Order  AS I at first proposed to investigate the three progressive orders of Masons Apprentices Craftsmen and Masters by a definition and description of the several circumstances which attended the wor∣shipers of the true Godso have I in the former lectures shewn that by order in the Apprentices is implied the first know∣ledge of the God of nature in the earliest ages of manUnder the Craftsmen I have shewn the Mosaic legation and the Jewish Temple at Jerusalem together with the light which men received for the discovery of the divine Wisdom by  geometrical solutionsI now proceed to the third stage the most sacred and solemn order of Masons the MASTER MASON'S ORDER  Under the Jewish law the service of God became clouded and obscured by ceremonies and rites which had daily crept in upon it through imitation of the neighbouring heathenWhen the mo∣rals of the Jewish nation were corrupted civil jurisdiction reeled upon its throne innovations sapped the religious rule and anarchy succeededNo sooner was this compact loosened than the strength of the Jews was dissolved and the heathen triumphed in Jerusalem  The gracious Divinity perceiving the ruin which was overwhelming mankind in his benevolence was moved to redeem usHe saw that the revelation which he had deigned to make of his divinity might majesty and wisdom to the Jewish tribes was not sufficient to preserve them in their duty he weighed the frailty of mankind in the balance which his justice  suspended and to their deficiencies he bestowed his mercyThe Egyptians had abused their learning and wisdomthe Jews had polluted God's ordinances and lawsand Sin had made her dominion in the strong places of the earth  Piety which had planned the Temple at Jerusalem was expungedthe reve∣rence and adoration due to the Divinity was buried in the filth and rubbish of the worldpersecution had dispersed the few who retained their obedience and the name of the true God was almost to∣tally lost and forgotten among men Religion sat mourning in Israel in sackcloth and ashes and Morality was scat∣tered as it were by the four winds of the air  In this situation it might well be said  That the guide to heaven was lost and the master of the works of righteous∣ness was smitten  The nations had given themselves up to the grossest idola∣try Solomon had fallen and the service of the true God was effaced from the  memory of those who had yielded them∣selves to the dominion of sin  In order that mankind might be pre∣served from this deplorable estate of dark∣ness and destruction and AS THE OLD LAW WAS DEAD AND BECOME ROTTENESS a new doctrine and new precepts were wanting to give the key to salvation in the language of which we might touch the ear of an offended Deity and bring forth hope for eternity TRUE RELIGION was fled  Those who sought her through the wisdom of the antients were not able to raise her she eluded the grasp and their polluted hands were stretched forth in vain for her restoration  Those who sought her by the old law were frustrated for  Death had stepped between and Corruption defiled the embrace  Sin had beset her steps and the vices of the world had overwhelmed her  The great Father of all commiserating the miseries of the world sent his only Son who was INNOCENCE itself to  teach the doctrine of salvationby whom man was raised from the death of sin unto the life of righteousnessfrom the tomb of corruption unto the cham∣bers of hopefrom the darkness of des∣pair to the celestial beams of faithand not only working for us this redemption but making with us the covenant of re∣generation whence we are become the children of the Divinity and inheritors of the realms of Heaven  We MASONS describing the deplora∣ble estate of religion under the Jewish law speak in figures  Her tomb was in the rubbish and filth cast forth of the temple and ACACIA wove its branches over her monument  being the Greek word for innocence or being free from sin implying that the sins and corruptions of the old law and devotees of the Jewish altar had hid religion from those who sought her and she was only to be found where INNOCENCE sur∣vived and under the banner of the di∣vine Lamband as to ourselves pro∣fessing that we were to be distinguished  by our ACACY or as true ACACIANS in our religious faith and tenets  AcaciaAKAKIA in antiquity a roll or bag represented on the medals of the Greek and Roman Emperors some think it is only an hand∣kerchief which they used as a signal others take it for a volume or roll of memorandums or peti∣tions and others will have it to be a purple bag filled with earth to remind the prince of his mor∣tality Acacians Acaciani in church history the name of a sect of religious and professed chris∣tians some of whom maintained that the Son was only of a like not the same substance with the Father and others that he was not only of a distinct but also of a dissimilar substance Acacy in Johnson's Dictionary  Gr in∣nocence or being free from sin    The acquisition of the doctrine of re∣demption is expressed in the typical cha∣racter of HURAMEN  inveni and by the applications of that name with masons it is implied that we have dis∣covered the knowledge of God and of his salvation and have been redeemed  from the death of sin and the sepulchre of pollution and unrighteousness  The mason advancing to this state of ma∣sonry pronounces his own sentence as confessional of the imperfection of the second stage of his pro∣fession and as probationary of the exalted de∣gree to which he aspires in this Greek distich  Struo tumulum  I prepare my se∣pulchre I make my grave in the pollutions of the earth I am under the shadow of death  This distich has been vulgarly corrupted among us and an expression takes its place scarcely simi∣lar in sound and entirely inconsistent with ma∣sonry and unmeaning in itself    Thus the MASTER MASON re∣presents a man under the christian doc∣trine saved from the grave of iniquity and raised to the faith of salvation  As the great testimonial that we are risen from the state of corruption we bear the emblem of the HOLY TRINITY as the insignia of our vows and of the origin of the Master's orderThis em∣blem  is given by geometricians as a de∣monstration of the Trinity in Unity  On receiving this ensign the mason professeth himself in a short distich in the Greek language which from the rules of our order I am forbid to com∣mit to writing the literal meaning of which is  VEHEMENTER CUPIO VITAM  ardently I wish for life meaning the everlasting life of redemp∣tion and regeneration an avowal which carries with it the most religious import and must proceed from a pure faith The ceremonies attending this stage of  our profession are solemn and tremen∣dous during which a sacred awe is dif∣fused over the mind the soul is struck with reverence and all the spiritual fa∣culties are called forth to worship and adoration  This our order is a positive contra∣distinction to the Judaic blindness and in∣fidelity and testifies our faith concerning the resurrection of the body  The divine construction put upon this emblem of the Master's Order which he declares is the principle by which he is raised from darkness so it is also the emblem of moral duties professed by the mason and which in former ages were most religiously performed These also are principles immediately resulting from the christian doctrine  The MASTER MASON imposes a duty on himself full of moral virtue and christian charity by enforcing that bro∣therly love which every man should ex∣tend to his neighbour  FIRST That when the calamities of our brother call for our aid we should not withdraw the hand that might sustain him from sinking but that we should render him those services which not in∣cumb'ring or injuring our families or for∣tunes charity and religion may dictate for the saving of our fellowcreature  SECOND From which purpose indo∣lence should not persuade the foot to halt or wrath turn our steps out of the way but forgetting injuries and selfish feelings and rememb'ring that man was born for the aid of his generation and not for his own enjoyments only but to do that which is good we should be swift to have mercy to save to strengthen and execute benevolence  THIRD As the good things of this life are partially dispensed and some are opulent whilst others are in distress such principles also enjoin a mason be he ever so poor to testify his goodwill to∣wards his brotherRiches alone do not allow the means of doing good VIR∣TUE  AND BENEVOLENCE are not confined to the walks of opulencethe rich man from his many talents is re∣quired to make extensive works under the principles of virtue and yet poverty is no excuse for an omission of that exer∣cise for as the cry of innocence ascendeth up to heaven as the voice of babes and sucklings reach the throne of God and as the breathings of a contrite heart are heard in the regions of dominion so a mason's prayers devoted to the welfare of his brother are required of him  FOURTH The fourth principle is never to injure the confidence of your brother by revealing his secrets for per∣haps that were to rob him of the guard which protects his property or lifeThe tongue of a mason should be void of of∣fence and without guilespeaking truth with discretion and keeping itself within the rule of judgmentmaintaining a heart void of uncharitableness locking up secrets and communing in charity and love  FIFTH Of charity So much is re∣quired of a mason in his gifts as dis∣cretion shall limitcharity begins at home but like a fruitful olive tree planted by the side of a fountain whose boughs overshoot the wall so is cha∣rity it spreads its arms abroad from the strength and opulence of its station and lendeth its shade for the repose and re∣lief of those who are gathered under its branchesCharity when given with imprudence is no longer a virtue but when flowing from abundance it is glo∣rious as the beams of morning in whose beauty thousands rejoice When dona∣tions extorted by pity are detrimental to a man's family they become sacrifices to superstition and like incense to idols are disapproved by heaven  As Moses was commanded to pull his shoes from off his feet on Mount Horeb because the ground whereon he trod was sanctified by the presence of the Divinity so the mason who would prepare himself for this third stage of masonry should advance in the naked paths of truth  be divested of every degree of arrogance and come as a true ACACIAN with steps of innocence humility and virtue to challenge the ensigns of an order whose institutions arise on the most so∣lemn and sacred principles of religion  LECTURE X  The  Secrecy  of  Masons  IN this age when every thing serious is received with laughter every thing religious treated with contempt and whatever is moral spurned from the doors of the polite no wonder if my intentions to prove this society of reli∣gious as well as civil institution is ridi∣culed and despised  It is not to be doubted many assem∣blies of MASONS were held before the christian aera the first stage of masonry took its rise in the earliest times was ori∣ginated in the mind of ADAM descended  pure through the antedeluvian ages was afterwards taught by HAM and from him amidst the corruptions of mankind flowed unpolluted and unstained with idolatry to these our times by the channel of some few of the SONS OF TRUTH who remained uncontaminated with the sins of nations saving to us pure and spotless principles together with the original sym∣bolsThese antients enlightned with original truth were dispersed through many statesthey were called to join the Jewish nation and many of them be∣came united with that people The WISEHEARTED were employed in the con∣struction of the tabernacle of Moses they were embodied at the building of the temple at Jerusalem and might from thence emigrate into distant countries where they would superintend other re∣ligious works The ceremonies now known to masons prove that the testi∣monials and insignia of the Masters' or∣der in the present state of masonry were devised within the ages of christianity and I am confident there are not any re∣cords in being in any nation or in any language which can shew them to be  pertinent to any other system or give them greater antiquity  In this country under the Druids the first principles of our profession most assu∣redly were taught and exercised how soon the second stage and its ceremonials were promulged after the building of the tem∣ple at Jerusalem we have no degree of evidence As to the third and most sa∣cred order no doubt it was adopted up∣on the conversion of those who attended the DRUIDICAL WORSHIP who had professed the adoration of the ONE SU∣PREME BEING and who readily would receive the doctrines of a MEDIATOR a system in religion which had led the sages of old into innumerable errors and at last confounded them with idolatry  Under our present profession of ma∣sonry we alledge our morality was ori∣ginally deduced from the school of Py∣thagoras and that the Basilidian system of religion furnished us with some tenets principles and hieroglyphics but these together with the Egyptian symbols and Judaic monuments are collected only as  a successional series of circumstances which the devotees of the Deity in dif∣ferent and distant ages of the world had professed and are all resolved into the present system of masonry which is made perfect in the doctrine of christianity from these united members gaining alone that evidence of antiquity which shews that we are descendants of the first wor∣shippers of the Deity  That there were builders of cities towers temples and fortifications from the earliest ages is indisputablebut that the artificers were formed into bo∣dies ruled by their own proper laws and knowing mysteries and secrets which were kept from the world I am greatly doubtfulfor so plain easy and intel∣ligible is the mechanic art of building that it is comprehensible to any capacity and needed not to be wrapped up in mystic rules neither was there any oc∣casion for the artificers to go about as conjurers professing a science unrevealed to the world  Man would be taught building by the animals daily under his observation the fox the rabbit and many other crea∣tures form themselves caves the beaver is an architect in wood and builds hovels and sheds the birds at a season for their increase prepare their nests for the pro∣tection of their young the bee labours in constructing cities and storehouses the ants are cloistered in their little mount perforated with labyrinths where their provender and progeny are securedAll these would instruct men in building so that whilst our race were reaping the first rudiments of knowledge from the book of nature after the darkness which had overwhelmed them in their disobe∣dience this could remain no secret  Besides if we should be resolved into the successors of mechanics and as such should take our grand progress from the building of the temple at Jerusalem we shall find that HIRAM who was sent from Tyre to assist in that structure had not his excellence in architecture only but in molten work and also in dying  as is said in Chronicles  He was skilful to work in silver and gold in brass in iron in stone and in timber in pur∣ple in blue in fine linen and in crim∣son also to grave all manner of gra∣ving  He was the subject of a state wherein the worship of idols was estab∣lishedThis kind of religion gave en∣couragement to and greatly advanced the fine arts as it employed statuaries sculptors painters and those who made graven imagesSolomon ornamented his temple with cherubins and palm trees fruits and flowers from whence I do not doubt Hiram's knowledge was in the bu∣siness of a statuary and painter that he made graven images of stone and wood and molten images in metalsIn Kings it is said only  that Hiram was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass  As to Solomon's part in this great struc∣ture he being inclined to this mighty work of piety through the ordinances of heaven and the promises made to his fa∣ther David was the executor of that plan which was revealed to him from a∣bovehe called forth the sages and reli∣gious  men amongst his people to perform the workhe classed them according to their rank in their religious profession as the priests of the temple were stationed in the solemn rites and ceremonies instituted thereThis distinction was maintained in most religious societies but especially with the primitive christiansThe cho∣sen ones of Solomon as a pious and holy duty conducted the workIf we regard them as architects by profession by reason of this duty so we may Abel Noah Abraham Jacob Moses and David by reason of the building of their altars which were no other than works of piety and devotionFrom those circumstances I am bold to say that if we trace the antiquity of masonry on the operative principles and derive such principles from the building of Solomon's Temple we may as well claim all the professions which Hiram excelled inbut I will leave this speculation for more material subjects  Some masters of design have brought their works to a singular justness sym∣metry and order in Egypt and Greece in Italy and many other European states  but they like proficients in painting and music had their excellence from a degree of genius and taste peculiar to themselves It was a singular gift and they needed not mysteries to keep it secret for as men's geniuses are as various as their fea∣tures so was this excellence in architec∣ture as free from usurpation as if it had been wrapped up in the most profound magic  I am persuaded there was no occasion to form such secret rules for the compact of operative masonsSolomon for the conduct of such a multitude wisely pre∣served the order of the religious and the mysteries of their initiation for the rule of his people employed in the templeAs∣suredly the secrets revealed to us were for other uses than what relate to labouring up masses of stone and our society as it now stands is an association on religious and charitable principles which princi∣ples were instituted and arose upon the knowledge of God and in the christian revelation  Soon after the time that christianity became the established religion of this country the professors of it employed themselves in founding religious houses and in the building of places of public worshipOn any reform of religion it is observable the first professors are inclina∣ble to enthusiasmSuch was the case in this land on the advancement of the christian doctrinea fervor for endow∣ments infatuated the minds of the con∣vertedcertain days were assigned for the purpose of attending to religious works and edifices called hallywarkdays on which no man of what pro∣fession rank or estate soever was ex∣empt from attending that dutyBesides there were a set of men called halywerkfolk  De Hermitorio Finchalensis Ranulphus Dei gratia Dunelmensis Episcopus omnibus hominibus suis Francis et Anglis de haly werc folc salutem c  Many other grants are in my possession of this kind Ralph Flamberd was consecrated Bishop of Durham in  to whom were assigned certain  lands which they held by the service of repairing defending or building churches and sepulchres for which pious labours they were exempt from all feodal and military services these men being stonecutters and builders might also be of our profession and most probably they were selected from thence the two being in no wise incompatible with each otherThe county of Durham  Hist Dunelm apud Wartoni Aug Sax  entertained a parti∣cular set of those halywerkfolk who were guards of the patrimony and holy sepulchre of St CuthbertThese men come the nearest to a similitude of Solo∣mon's masons and to the title of FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS of any degree of architects I have gained any knowledge of but whether their initia∣tion was attended with any peculiar cere∣monies or by what laws they were regu∣lated I have not been able to discover and must lament that in the church re∣cords of Durham or in any public office there there are not the least remains of evidence touching these people and the con∣stitution  of their society It was a matter to be coveted by me lecturing on this subject as most probably such constitution or evidence would have confirmed every hypothesis I have raised on the definition of our emblems and mysteries  The emblems used by these people very much resembled those of our society several tokens of which have been found of late years in pulling down old ruins It is much to be wished that those noble∣men c in whose possession antient ab∣beys stand would on all occasions of pul∣ling down or repairing give instructions to their workmen to preserve with care any antique marks characters or em∣blems they may findThere are some double walls or hollow pillars in which such things were depositedFew men will be at the expence of digging to the foundations of such buildings where valuable marks and curious inscriptions would be found on the foundation or what was called the anglestone which formed a perfect cubeThis was a very antient custom the unbelieving Jews ac∣cused our Saviour of having stolen the  mystic words the TETRAGRAMMA∣TON or URIM AND THUMMIM from the foundation of the temple at Jerusalem which they said he carried concealed about him whereby he was enabled to work his miracles  Soon after the progress of christianity in this land all Europe was inflamed with the cry and madness of an enthusiastic monk who prompted the zealots in re∣ligion to the holy war in which for the purpose of recovering the holy city and Judea out of the hands of infidels armed legions of saints devotees and enthu∣siasts in tens of thousands poured forth from every state of Europe to waste their blood and treasure in a purpose as barren and unprofitable as impolitic  It was deemed necessary that those who took up the ensign of the cross in this enterprize should form themselves into such societies as might secure them from spies and treacheries and that each might know his companion and brother labourer as well in the dark as by day As it was with Jeptha's army  at the passes of Jordan so also was it requisite in these expeditions that certain signs signals watchwords or passwords should be known amongst them for the armies consisted of various nations and various languagesWe are told in the book of Judges  that the Gileadites took the passes of Jordan before the Ephraimites and it was so that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of Gilead said unto him Art thou an Ephraimite If he said nay then said they unto him say now Shib∣boleth and he said Sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right Then they took them and slew them at the passage of Jordan  The application which is made of the word  Sib∣boleth  amongst masons is as a testimony of their re∣taining their  original vow  uninfringed and their first saith with the brotherhood uncorrupted And to render their words and phrases more abstruse and obscure they selected such as by acceptation in the scriptures or otherwise might puzzle the ignorant by a double implicationThus  Sibboleth  should we  have adopted the Elusimian mysteries would an∣swer as an avowal of our profession the same im∣plying  Ears of Corn  but it has its etymology or derivation from the following compounds in the Greek tongue as it is adopted by masons viz  Colo and  Lapis so  Sibbolithon  Colo Lapidem  implies that they re∣tain and keep inviolate their obligations as the  Juramentum per Jovem L  pid  m  the most obliga∣tory oath held amongst the heathen  The name Lapis or as others write Lapideus was given to Jupiter by the Romans who conceived that Juramentum per Jovem Lapidem an oath by Jupiter Lapis was the most obligatory oath and it is derived either from the stone which was presented to Saturn by his wise Ops who said that it was Jupiter in which sense Eusebius says that Lapis reigned in Crete or from lipide silice the flint stone which in making bargains the swearer held in his hand and said 'If knowingly I deceive so let Diespiter saving the city and the capital cast me away from all that's good as I cast away this stone' Where∣upon he threw the stone away  Pantheon  No project or device could answer the purposes of the crusadors better than those of masonrythe maxims and ceremonials attending the Master's order had been  previously established and were materi∣ally necessary on that expedition for as the Mahomedans were also worshippers of the Deity and as the enterprizers were seeking a country where the masons were in the time of Solomon called into an association and where some remains would certainly be found of the mysteries and wisdom of the antients and of our prede∣cessors Such degrees of masonry as ex∣tended only to the acknowledgment of their being servants of the God of nature would not have distinguished them from those they had to encounter had they not assumed the symbols of the christian faith  All the learning of Europe in those times as in the ages of antiquity was possessed by the religiousthey had ac∣quired the wisdom of the antients and the original knowledge which was in the beginning and now is THE TRUTH many of them had been initiated into the mysteries of masonrythey were the projectors of this enterprize and as Solo∣mon in the building of the temple intro∣duced orders and regulations for the con∣duct  of the work which his wisdom had been enriched with from the learning of the sages of antiquity so that no confu∣sion should happen during its progress and so that the rank and office of each fellowlabourer might be distinguished and ascertained beyond the possibility of de∣ceit in like manner the priests projecting the crusades being possessed of the mys∣teries of masonry the knowledge of the antients and of the universal language which survived the confusion of Shinar revived the orders and regulations of So∣lomon and initiated the legions therein who followed them to the Holy Land hence that secrecy which attended the crusaders  Amongst other evidence which autho∣rizes me in the conjecture that masons went to the holy wars is the doctrine of that order of masons called the HIGHER ORDER I am induced to believe that order was of Scottish extraction separate nations might be distinguished by some separate order as they were by singular ensigns but be that as it may it fully proves to me that masons were crusaders  As my intention in this lecture was not only to speculate on the antient se∣crecy amongst masons but also to treat of the secrecy of masons in this age I must therefore turn my thoughts to the importance secresy is now of amongst us when there are no holy structures to erect no holy wars to wage and nothing but charity and brotherly love to cherish a∣mong masons  This institution which was first founded in the mysteries of religion as I have be∣fore rehearsed to you is now maintained by us on the principles of lending mutual aid and consolation to each otherHow should we be able to discern the brethren of this family but through such tokens as should point them out from other men Language is now provincial and the dia∣lects of different nations would not be comprehensible to men ignorant and un∣lettered Hence it became necessary to use an expression which should be cog∣nizable by people of all nationsSo it is with masonsthey are possessed of that universal expression and of such remains  of the original language that they can communicate their history their wants and prayers to every brother mason throughout the globefrom whence it is certain that multitudes of lives have been saved in foreign countries when shipwreck and misery had overwhelmed them when robbers had pillaged when sickness want and misery had brought them even to the brink of the grave the discovery of masonry has saved them the discovery of being a brother hath staid the savage hand of the conqueror lifted in the field of battle to cut off the captive hath withheld the sword im∣brued in carnage and slaughter and sub∣dued the insolence of triumph to pay homage to the craft  The importance of secrecy with us is such that we may not be deceived in the dispensing of our charitiesthat we may not be betrayed in the tenderness of our benevolence and others usurp the portion which is prepared for those of our own family  To betray the watchword which should keep the enemy from the walls of our citadel so as to open our strong∣holds to robbers and deceivers is as great a moral crime as to shew the common thief the weaknesses and secret places of our neighbour's dwellinghouses that he may pillage their goodsNay it is still greater for it is like aiding the sacrile∣gious robber to ransack the holy places and steal the sacred vessels devoted to the most solemn rites of religionIt is snatching from the divine hand of cha∣rity the balm which she holds forth to heal the distresses of her children the cor∣dial cup of consolation which she offers to the lip of calamity and the sustenance her fainting infants should receive from the bosom of her celestial love  As this then is the importance of ma∣sons secrecy wherefore should the world wonder that the most profligate tongue which ever had expression hath not re∣vealed it The sport is too criminal to afford delight even to the wickedest of mankind for it must be wantonness only  which could induce any man to divulge it as no profit could arise therefrom nor selfish view be gratifiedIt was men∣tioned by divine lips as a crime not in nature  What man is there of you whom if his son ask for bread will give him a stone or if he ask a fish will give him a serpent  Then can there be a man so iniquitous among ma∣sons as to guide the thief to steal from his sick brother the medicine which should restore his health the balsam which should close his wounds the cloathing which should shield his trembling limbs from the severity of the winter the drink which should moisten his fainting lip the bread which should save his soul alive  Such is the importance of our secrecy were there no other ties upon our af∣fections or consciences than merely the sense of the injury we should do to the poor and the wretched by a transgression of this rule I am persuaded it would be sufficient to lock up the tongue of every man who professeth himself to be a MA∣SON  LECTURE XI  Of  Charity  AS one of the principal characteristics of a Mason in this lecture I will treat of CHARITY  I do not mean to make strictures on that modern error of indiscriminately dispensing alms to all suppliants without regard to their real wants or real merits whereby the hypocrite and knave often eat the bread which virtue in distress ought to be relieved byThis is a mis∣taken character of charity in which she is too often abusedThough the boun∣ties of benevolence and compassion are given with a righteous wish yet they should be ruled by discretion  The antients used to depict the virtue CHARITY in the character of a goddess seated in a chair of ivory with a golden tire upon her head set with precious stonesher vesture like the light of heaven represented universal benevo∣lence her throne was unpolluted and unspotted by passions and prejudices and the gems of her fillet represented the inestimable blessings which flowed variously from her bounty  They also represented the charities otherwise called the graces under three personagesone of these was painted with her back towards us and her face forward as proceeding from us and the other two with their faces towards us to denote that for one benefit done we should receive double thanksthey were painted naked to intimate that good of∣fices should be done without dissembling and hypocrisythey were represented young to signify that the remembrance of benefits should never wax oldand also laughing to tell us that we should do good to others with chearfulness and  alacrityThey were represented linked together arm in arm to instruct us that one kindness should prompt another so that the knot and bond of love should be indissolubleThe poets tell us that they used to wash themselves in the fountain Acidalius because benefits gifts and goodturns ought to be sincere and pure and not base sordid and counterfeit  CHARITY in the works of moralists is defined to be the love of our brethren or a kind of brotherly affection one to∣wards anotherThe rule and standard that this habit is to be examined and re∣gulated by among christians is the love we bear to ourselves or that the Me∣diator bore towards usthat is it must be unfeigned constant and out of no other design than their happiness  Such are the general sentiments which the antients entertained of this virtue and what the modern moralists and chris∣tians define it to be at this day  In what character CHARITY should be received among masons is now my  purpose to define as it stands limited to our own society  The principles which alone should attend a candidate for initiation to our society are pathe∣tically represented in the following psalm  PSALM XV    Lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall abide in thy holy hill    He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart    He that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour    In whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the Lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not    He that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent He that doeth these things shall never be moved  As being so limited we are not through that channel subject to be imposed on by false pretences and are certain of the proper and merited administration of it It is hence to be hoped that it exists with us without dissembling or hypocrisy and lives in sincerity and truththat be∣nefits  received impress a lively degree of gratitude and affection on the minds of masons as their bounties should be be∣stowed with chearfulness and unac∣quainted with the frozen singer of reluc∣tancethe benevolence of our society should be so mutual and brotherly that each ought to endeavour to render good offices as readily as he would receive them  The misplacing of a benefit is worse than the not receiving of it for the one is another man's fault but the other is mine The error of the giver does oft times excuse the ingrati∣tude of the receiver for a favour ill placed is rather a profusion than a benefit It is the most shameful of losses an inconsiderate bounty I will chuse a man of integrity sincere conside∣rate grateful temperate wellnatured neither covetous nor sordid and when I have obliged such a man though not worth a groat in the world I have gained my end If we give only to receive we lose the fairest objects for our charity the absent the sick the captive and the needy  Seneca of Benefits  The rule is we are to give as we would re∣ceive chearfully quickly and without hesita∣tion  for there is no grace in a benefit that sticks to the fingers A benefit should be made acceptable by all possible means even to the end that the receiver who is never to forget it may bear it in his mind with satisfaction  The same  It is not the value of the present but the be∣nevolence of the mind that we are to consider that which is given with pride and ostentation is rather an ambition than a bounty  The same  In order to exercise this virtue both in the character of masons and in com∣mon life with propriety and agreeable to such principles we should forget every obligation but affection for otherwise it were to confound charity with duty The feelings of the heart ought to direct the hand of CHARITYTo this pur∣pose we should be divested of every idea of superiority and estimate ourselves as being of the same rank and race of men in this disposition of mind we may be susceptible of those sentiments which CHARITY delighteth in to feel the woes and miseries of others with a ge∣nuine and true sympathy of soulCOM∣PASSION  is of heavenly birthit is one of the first characteristics of huma∣nityPeculiar to our race it distin∣guishes us from the rest of creation  Corinth chap xiii  Ver Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal  And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all know∣ledge and though I have all saith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing  And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing  Charity suffereth long and is kind cha∣rity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up  Doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil  Rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth  Beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things  Charity never faileth but whether there  be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away  For we know in part and we prophesy in part  But when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away  "When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things  For now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known  And now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity  He whose bosom is locked up against compassion is a Barbarianhis manners must be brutalhis mind gloomy and moroseand his passions as savage as the beasts of the forest  What kind of man is he who full of opulence and in whose hand abundance overflows can look on virtue in distress and merit in misery without pityWho could behold without tears the desolate and forlorn estate of a WIDOW who in  early life having been brought up in the bosom of a tender mother without knowing care and without tasting of necessity was not befitted for adversity whose soul was pure as innocence and full of honorwhose mind had been brightned by erudition under an indul∣gent fatherwhose youth untutored in the school of sorrows had been flattered with the prospect of days of prosperity and plentyone who at length by the cruel adversity of winds and seas with her dying husband is wrecked in total de∣struction and beggary driven by ill for∣tune from peace and plenty and from the bed of ease changes her lot to the dank dunghill for the relief of her wea∣riness and paingrown meagre with necessity and sick with woeat her bosom hanging her famished infant draining off the dregs of parental life for sustenance bestowed from maternal loveyielding existence to support the babeHardhearted covetousness and proud titles can ye behold such an ob∣ject dry eyedCan avarice grasp the mite which should sustain such virtue Can high life lift its supercilious brow  above such scenes in human life above such miseries sustained by a fellowcrea∣tureIf perchance the voice of the un∣fortunate and wretched widow is heard in complainings when wearying PATI∣ENCE and relaxing RESIGNATION breathes a sigh whilst modesty forbids her supplication is not the groan the sigh more pathetic to your ear you rich ones than all the flattering petitions of a cringing knave who touches your vanity and tickles your follies extorting from your very weaknesses the prostituted por∣tion of CHARITYPerhaps the fatal hour's at hand when consolation is re∣quired to close the last moments of this unfortunate one's lifecan the man ab∣sorbed in pleasure roll his chariot wheels beyond the scene of sorrow without com∣passion and without pity see the last con∣vulsion and the deadly gaze which paint misery upon the features of an expiring saintIf angels weep in heaven they weep for suchif they can know con∣tempt they feel it for the wealthy who bestow not of their superfluities and snatch not from their vices what would gladden souls sunk in the woes of worldly  adversityThe eyes of cherubims view with delight the exercise of such benevo∣lence as forms the character of the good Samaritansaints touch their golden lyres to hymn HUMANITY's fair history in realms of bliss and approbation shines upon the countenance divine of OMNI∣PRESENCE when a man is found in the exercise of virtue  What should that human wretch be called who with premeditated cruelty and avarice devises mischief whilst he is conscious of his neighbour's honesty whilst he sees him industriously day by day labouring with sweaty brow and weary limbs toiling with chearfulness for breadon whose exerted labour an af∣fectionate and virtuous wife and healthy children crowding his narrow hearth with naked feet depend for sustenance whilst he perceives him with integrity more than human taking scrupulously his own and wronging no man for his hunger or his wantswhilst he sees him with fatigued sinews lengthen out the toil of industry from morn to night with unremitting ardor singing to elude re∣pining  and smoothing his anxieties and pain with hope that he shall reward his weariness by the overflowings of his wife's chearful heart and with the smiles of his feeding infantsWhat must he be who knows such a man and by his craft or avarice extorts unjust demands and brings him into beggaryWhat must he be who sees such a man deprived by fire or water of all his substance the habitation of his infants lost and nothing left but nakedness and tearsand seeing this af∣fords the sufferer no reliefSurely in nature few such wretches do exist but if such be it is not vain presumption to proclaim that like accursed Cain they are distinguished as the outcast of God's mercies and are left on earth to live a life of punishment  The objects of true CHARITY are MERIT and VIRTUE in distressper∣sons who are incapable of extricating themselves from misfortunes which have overtaken them in old ageindustrious men from inevitable accidents and acts of Providence rushed into ruinwidows left survivors of their husbands by whose  labours they subsistedorphans in tender years left naked to the world  What the claims of such on the hand of charity when you compare them to the miscreants who infest the doors of every dwelling with their importunities wretches wandering from their homes shewing their distortions and their sores to prompt compassion with which illgotten gains in concert with thieves and vagabonds they revel away the hours of night which conceals their iniquities and vices  CHARITY when misapplied loses her titles and instead of being adorned with the dress of virtue assumes the insignifi∣cance the bells and feathers of folly  LECTURE XII  On  Brotherly Love  I Shall treat of BROTHERLY LOVE in this lecture in that light which solely appertains to masons  The necessity there is for the exertion of brotherly regard among masons in the lodge is obvious to every one PEACE REGULARITY and DECORUM are indispensible duties hereall the sire of resentment and remembrance of in∣juries should be forgotten and that cordiality ought to be warm among us which brings with it chearfulness and re∣joicingthe true worshipers of the Deity men who held just notions of the princi∣ples of nature in the times of barbarous  ignorance durst not publicly practise the one or promulgate the otherbut happy is our estate in this lettered age and this land of liberty we profess our sentiments with freedom and without fear we exer∣cise our religious principles under a full toleration and as social beings we assemble in the lodge to enjoy the pleasures of friendship and the breathings of true benevolence without alloy  After the business of the lodge is dis∣patched we are met together to open out the chearfulness of our hearts with∣out guile for here are no talebearers censors or revilers among usour lodge is sacred to SILENCEhence we may say figuratively  it is situate in the se∣cret places where the cock holdeth not his watch where the voice of rail∣ing reacheth not where brawling as the intemperate wrath of women can∣not be heard  Without suspicion of being betrayed in our words or ensnared in the openness of our dealings our mirth here is un∣disguised is governed by PRUDENCE  tempered with LOVE and cloathed in CHARITYthus it standeth void of offenceno malicious mind warps inno∣cent expressions to wicked constructions or interprets unmeaning jests into sar∣casms or satyres but as every sentiment flows full of benevolence so every ear here is attuned to the strain in harmo∣nious concord and tastes the pleasures of festivity so pure that they bear our re∣flections in the morning without remorse  Peace regularity and decorum which I said were indispensible duties here are not the offspring of controul or the issue of authority but a voluntary service which every man brings to the lodge  There are seasons indeed in which authority is properly exercisedman is frailthe most prudent may sometimes deviateit was a maxim of the antient philosophers that "to err was human" therefore in the lodge there ought to be a constant governor who should restrain the improprieties which may creep in among us by any brother coming here after an intemperance in liquor  Another degree of brotherly love which should prevail here is to hear the peti∣tions of every member of this society with tenderness and attentionWhere there is at any time a brother of our commu∣nity sick or in distress the case of his ca∣lamities should come here represented by a brother who will neither deceive us nor hold back any part of his merits and the lodge must testify all due regard by receiving the petition patiently and giving relief according to the deserts  The most material part of that bro∣therly love which should subsist among us masons is that of speaking well of each other to the worldmore especially it is expected of every member of this fraternity that he should not traduce his brotherCalumny and slander are detestable crimes against societyNo∣thing can be viler than to traduce a man behind his back it is like the villainy of an assassin who has not virtue enough to give his adversary the means of selfdefence but lurking in darkness stabs  him whilst he is unarmed and unsuspi∣cious of an enemy  Of this crime the muchadmired poet Shakespear has given a just description  "The man who steals my purse steals trash  "'Twas mine 'tis his and may be slave to thousands  "But he who pilfers from me my good name  "Robs me of that which not enriches him  "But makes me poor indeed"  Calumny has this direful consequence that it carries with it not a momentary effect only but endures for time un∣countedThe wickedness of the world is such that it is greedy of scandal and when once the voice of defamation hath uttered its poison like a pestilence it smites and contaminatesit spreads jea∣lousies in families division and wrath among friends urges fathers against chil∣dren and brother against brotherWhen once the pernicious tale gets birth it cannot be recalled and thence the sin∣ner's penitence is not capable of expia∣tion for the evil consequences may lay dormant in the womb of futurity and become an intail of sorrow on the third and fourth generation of him that is in∣jured  What malice and mischief what infernal disposition must actuate the mind which is capable of defaming the inno∣centthere is no crime of which such a wretch might not be the perpetrator against such a villain there is no armour for defencehe assaults the naked and unsuspicious and like the contagion of some horrid disease he smiteth whilst the victim sleepsJustice is disarmed against such a sinner as concealment is his safe∣guard and only the eye of heaven disco∣vers his iniquity  It is not only expected of masons that they should with a conscientious soul rerefrain from evilspeaking but also that they should speak well of each other  To give a man his just and due cha∣racter is so easy a duty that it is not possible for a benevolent mind to avoid it it is a degree of common justice which honesty itself prompts one toIt is not enough that we refrain from slander but it is required of masons that they should speak graciously and with affection with∣holding nothing that can be uttered to a  brother's praise or good name with truth What a pleasure doth it give the heart feeling benevolent dispositions to give praises where dueThere is a selfish joy in good speaking as selfapprobation suc∣ceeds itBesides the breast of such a man feels enlarged whilst he utters the praise due to his neighbour and he ex∣periences all the finest sensations of love whilst he moves others to the same object of his regard  The neutral disposition frigid and re∣served neither speaks good nor evil but the man tasting brotherly love is warm to commendIt is an easy and cheap means of bestowing good gifts and working good worksfor by a just praise to industry you recommend the industrious man to those to whom he might never be known and thereby en∣large his credit and his tradeBy a just commendation of merit you may open the paths of advancement through those whose power might never have been peti∣tionedBy a proper praise of genius and art you may rouse the attention of those patrons to whom the greatest deservings  might have remained a secret It is a degree of justice which every man has a right to from his brother that his vir∣tues be not concealed  To shroud the imperfections of our friend and cloak his infirmities is chris∣tianlike and charitable consequently be∣sitting a masoneven the truth should not be told at all times for where we cannot approve we should pity in silence What pleasure or profit can there arise by exposing the secrets of a brother To exhort him is virtuousto revile him is inhuman and to set him out as an object of ridicule is infernal  From hence we must necessarily deter∣mine that the duty of a good man leads to work the works of benevolence and his heart is touched with joy whilst he acts within her precepts  Let us therefore be stedfast and im∣moveable in our ordinances that we be proved to have A TONGUE OF GOOD REPORT  LECTURE XIII  On the  Occupations  of  Masons  IN my former lectures I have declared it to be my opinion that MASONS in the present state of MASONRY were never a body of architectsBy the book of constitutions published by authority we see no grand communication held in form till of very late date neither is there any evidence therein to contradict the propositions I have laid downThe succession therein described is by no means to be accepted and understood in a literal sense but as a pedigree or chrono∣logical table of the servants of the Deity working in the duties of righteousness  I ground my judgment of the nature of our profession on our ceremonials and am convinced they have not their rela∣tion to building and architecture but are emblematical and imply moral spi∣ritual and religious tenetsIt appears to me selfevident that the situation of the lodge and its several parts are copied after the tabernacle and temple and are representative of the universe implying that the universe is the temple in which the Deity is every where present our mode of teaching the principles of our profession is derived from the Druids our maxims of morality from Pytha∣goras our chief emblems originally from Egypt to Basilides we owe the science of Abrax and the characters of those emanations of the Deity which we have adopted and which are so necessary for the maintenance of a moral societyI am induced to believe that our present ceremonies were more generally taught and more candidates were initiated there∣in on the opening of the crusades than in any other aera or on any other known occasion  The English historians agree that in the reign of Henry the Second and in the year at an interview between the Kings of England and France at∣tended by the prelates and nobility of both nations the Archbishop of Tyre pronounced such a melancholy account of S  ladine's success in the Holy Land and the miseries of the christians in that country that the audience was greatly affected with the relation and the two kings agreed to convert their whole at∣tention to the relief of those adventurers They received the cross from the hands of the archbishop resolving to go there in person and their example was fol∣lowed by Philip Count of Flanders and a great number of the prelates and nobi∣lity there presentA PLENARY IN∣DULGENCE was published in the pope's name for all that would make a fair confession of their sins and engage in the crusade the different nations assumed crosses of a different colour and RULES AND ORDERS were established for pre∣venting RIOT LUXURY AND DIS∣ORDER on the enterprize  These were the principal rules made for the regulation of the crusadersWe may conjecture these religious campaigns being over that men initiated in the mysteries of masonry and engaged and inrolled under those rules and orders which were established for the conduct of the nations in the holy war would form themselves into lodges and keep up their social meetings when returned home in commemoration of their adventures and mutual good offices in Palestine and for the propagation of that knowledge into which they had been initiated  As a further argument that builders and architects were not the original mem∣bers of our society the MASONS of the city of London obtained their incorpora∣tion and charter in the reign of King Henry the Fifth in or about the year they taking on themselves the name of FREE MASONSBy their charter they are governed by a master and two wardens with twentyfive as∣sistantsOf this incorporated body sixtyfive are of the livery of London  It has never been pretended that the society of FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS have in any manner been con∣nected or much less have united them∣selves with the incorporated body of ma∣sons enchartered but on the contrary have kept themselves totally apart  It has been alledged that in the reign of King Henry the Sixth an obsolete law was enacted setting forth  that by the yearly congregations and confederacies made by masons in their general assem∣blies the good course and effects of the statute of labourers were openly vio∣lated and broken and making the fu∣ture holding of their chapters and con∣gregations felony  It is impossible that this statute should relate to any other persons than the in∣corporated body of working masons who under an exclusive charter by se∣cret combinations raised the prices of their labour and prevented craftsmen of their fraternity not members of the charter from exercising their trade within the  limits of London which might occasion a grievance worthy of parliamentary re∣dressbut in what manner the statutes of labourers could be affected by the asso∣ciations of this fraternity of ours is not in my power to comprehend Our re∣cords give us no evidence of any such convocations at the time mentioned  By the charter of MASONS they as∣sumed the title of FREE MASONS be∣ing intitled to the franchises of the city of London  Why the title of FREE is annexed to our society or that of ACCEPTED I hope I may be allowed to conjecture was derived from the crusadesThere the volunteers entering into that service must be FREEMEN born free and not vil∣lains or under any vassallage for it was not until long after the crusades that vassallage and feudal services together with the slavish tenures were taken a∣way  They were intitled to the stile of AC∣CEPTED under that PLENARY IN∣DULGENCE  which the pope published for all that would confess their sins and inlist in the enterprize of the holy war whereby they were accepted and received into the bosom of the father of the church Some authors have presumed to tell us that it was the original design of the christian powers in their enterprize in the Holy Land to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem but I cannot discover any good authority for this assertionIn mo∣dern masonry it is given as a principle why our dedication of lodges is made to ST JOHN that the masons who engaged to conquer the Holy Land chose that saint for their patron I should be sorry to appropriate the Balsarian sect of chris∣tians of St John as an explanation of this principle ST JOHN obtains our dedication as being the proclaimer of that salvation which was at hand by the coming of Christ and we as a set of re∣ligious assembling in the true faith com∣memorate the proclamations of the Bap∣tistIn the name of ST JOHN THE EVANGELIST we acknowledge the testimonies which he gives and the di∣vine  which he makes manifest  But to return to the subject of the cru∣saders  It is probable that the same enthusiastic spirit which engaged men to enter into the crusades at the vast expence and ha∣zard which history describes also led them into as enormous a folly in the building of religious housesduring the reign of Henry the Second when the English first engaged in the holy war there were not less than one hundred and eleven abbeys nunneries and religious houses founded in this kingdomdu∣ring the reign of Richard the First eigh∣teenand during the reign of Henry the Third forty which shews the reli∣gious infatuation which had totally over∣run the minds of the people in those reignsThe Ecclesiastics in imitation of the works of Solomon might become the masters of those works and superin∣tend and conduct the labours of the in∣ferior sect of halywarkfolk that by acceptable hands such pious works might be conducted and from whence the ig∣norant and profane might be rejected like the Samaritansthese might assume  the honorary title of MASONS which from vulgar acceptation would naturally confound them with ordinary mechanics  In the AnglaNorman Antiquities it is said of FREE MASONS that they were an association of religious who en∣gaged in the founding and erecting of churches and religious houses in Palestine I have already mentioned the religious sect who were really architects and buil∣ders of churches the halywarkfolk with no small degree of respect they were a body of men subsisting before the crusadesthey were maintained by the church under which they held lands for the service of erecting and repairing churches and for the guarding of the sepulchres of saintsIt is not improbable that when the rage of holy works and holy wars and the desire of Palestine fired the minds of all Europe but a body of those people might embark in the enter∣prize and be transported thither to build churches for the better planting or pro∣pagating the christian doctrine or to guard and maintain the holy sepulchre I would be ready at all times to admit  these emigrants might possess some rules and ceremonies for initiation peculiar to themselves so far as the bearers of bur∣thens were admitted under Solomon in the building at Jerusalem and that they might retain their singular maxims and principles in secrecyand it may also be admitted that in honor of that gradation of masonry and of their profession they should claim the greatest antiquity from Solomon's temple at leastthey might even be more than a collateral branch of the FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS as I have before admitted and be ini∣tiated in the mysteries of masonry their occupation being in no wise incompatible with our profession and they might be known and distinguished by the title of OPERATIVE MASONS as the Essenes were divided into theoricks and practicks but from the writings of the author of the AnglaNorman Antiquities I am con∣vinced he was not a FREE AND ACCEP∣TED MASON himself and as the secrecy of that society had attracted the attention of many who as their curiosity was exer∣cised raised conjectures on the name of masons to discover their origin and prin∣ciples  or to reconcile their own opinions from whence nothing was more likely to strike the attention of an historian than this body of men the halywarkfolk rambling in Palestine were to his purpose  Were we claimants only of the title of mechanics we might have chose as an∣tient and a more honorable branch of the arts or scienceswe might have substi∣tuted geometry to a more worthy duty and have honored our Maker in some profession more expressive of our sense of his power and dignity  Our ORIGIN in this country is thought to be from the PHOENICI∣ANS who came here with the Tyrian Hercules and introduced the doctrines of HAM and the AMONIAN rites together with the HEBREW CUS∣TOMS and afterwards the emigrants from the Holy Land who taught us the rules instituted by SOLOMON at the temple of Jerusalem and finally the propagators of the christian doctrine who brought with them the principles of the  Master's Order and taught the con∣verted those sacred mysteries which are typical of the christian faith and pro∣fessional of the hope of the resurrection of the body and the life of regeneration Yet I fear few among us are equal to the cha∣racter we have assumed Our LODGES are not now appropriated to WORSHIP and RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES we meet as A SOCIAL SOCIETY inclined to acts of benevolence and suffer the more sacred offices to rest unperformed Whether this neglect is to our honor I presume not to remonstrate in our PRESENT STATE professing ourselves FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS We are totally severed from architects and are become a set of men working in the duties of CHARITY GOOD OF∣FICES and BROTHERLY LOVE christians in religionsons of liberty and loyal subjects we have adopted rules orders emblems and symbols which enjoin us to live a life of moralitywe have furnished our lodges with those striking objects which should at once in∣timate to us the mightiness and wisdom  of God the instability of the affairs of man and the various vicissitudes in hu∣man life and have set before our eyes preceptors of moral works and to strengthen our faith we have enlightned our lodge with the emblem of the Trinity  It is well known to us that there is scarce a state in Europe in which our fraternity have not formed a bodyThe wisdom of the antients would pass abroad into many regions and those who had assisted in the pious labours at Jerusalem would like Pythagoras teach the sciences and mysteries which they professed and communicate the system to which they had been initiatedreligious men would retain the doctrines and mysteries with reverence and with caution reveal them to those they thought worthy to receive hence the original knowledge would pass into many countriesbut there is no accounting for this universality of the so∣ciety upon the principles of architecture and operative masonrythe rage of churchbuilding had not contaminated all Europe as it did England neither is there any probable means to be deduced from  architecture and the practice of builders to account why in every tongue and in every kingdom the ceremonials of being made a mason should be the sameIf the honor of architecture was all that was to be regarded in the society various would be the devices by which the mem∣bers in each nation would profess it As architecture according to its present orders had its progress from Egypt and Greece some nations would have bor∣rowed symbols and ensigns peculiar to those people or we should have had in our ceremonies or in our workings some devices which might have distinguished to us the beauties orders ornaments proportions or symmetries of some or all of the rules modes or orders of archi∣tecture either from the plains of Shinar from Egypt Jerusalem Tadmore or Greece or have retained some geome∣trical problems on which the general principles of proportion in architecture were grounded or demonstratedbut instead of that it is well known to us that there is nothing of that kind reveal∣ed On the contrary our mysteries are totally abstracted from the rules of me∣chanics  they are relative to religion and morality and are conducive to pious works they are unfurnished with any type symbol of character but what ap∣pertains to demonstrate the servants and devotees of the great    There is not an instance of the Euro∣pean states uniting in any one enterprize save the holy war and from thence we most rationally must conceive the pre∣sent number of masons dispersed over the face of Europe was principally derived The Amonian rites are almost totally dis∣tinguished religious zeal has imbrued the sword in carnage and Europe has groaned under persecutions the Romans extirpated the Druids christians have glutted their cruel hands with slaughter bigotry and enthusiasm in every age have reigned in bloodshedBy the crusades the number of our society would be greatly augmented the occasion itself would revive the rules of masonry they being so well adapted to that purpose and also professional of the christian faith from whence sprang the spirit of the en∣terprizeAfter these pursuits subsided  bodies of men would be found in every country from whence the levies were called and what would preserve the so∣ciety in every state even during the per∣secutions of zealots the Master Mason's Order under its present principles is adapted to every sect of christians It originated from the earliest aera of chris∣tianity in honor to or in confession of the religion and faith of christians before the poison of sectaries was diffused over the church  To the antient rules deduced from So∣lomon other laws rules and ordinances were added upon the enterprizes of the crusaders for the prevention of riot luxury and disorder and for the main∣taining that necessary subordination which the command of such armies re∣quired Many of these rules we retain in the conduct and government of our lodge which can in no wise be deduced from any other original  LECTURE XIV  A  Corollary  I Shall now conclude these Lectures with collecting into one view the propositions and maxims which have en∣gaged my attention throughout the whole work thereby to give a clear idea of the mysteries of masonry the progression and spirit of its institution origin and pre∣sent state  I may have seemed prolix and have filled my arguments or representations with repetitions but where that seeming impropriety takes place it was necessary to urge a position which contended with some accepted error prepossession or vulgar prejudice  From the antient rites and ceremonies which I have laid before you it will be easy for you to trace the origins of our own and to discover the foundations on which our society was erected It is evi∣dent they had their progress in the postdeluvian world from Ham I am under a necessity sometimes to use terms of art or expressions which to others may not carry distinct and clear images but to my brethren breathe an energy which flows from the united force of technical terms symbols and hieroglyphics When I speak of masons under the denomina∣tion of a society I mean masons as embo∣died in lodges according to the present manners in which such lodges are held Our antiquity is in our principles max∣ims language learning and religion these we derive from Eden from the pa∣triarchs and from the sages of the east all which are made perfect under the christian dispensation The light and doctrines which we possess are derived from the beginning of time and have descended through this long succession of ages uncorrupted but our modes and manners are deduced from the different  aeras of paradise the building of the temple at Jerusalem and the christian revelation  I have explained to you that the struc∣ture of the LODGE is a pattern of the universe and that the first entry of a mason represents the first worship of the true GodWe have retained the Egyp∣tian symbols of the SUN AND MOON as the emblems of God's power eter∣nity omnipresence and benevolence and thereby we signify that we are the chil∣dren of light and that the first founda∣tion of our profession is the knowledge and adoration of the Almighty  who seateth himself in the centre of the heavenswe derive from the Druids many of the Amonian rites and I am bold to say that we retain more of the ceremonials and doctrines of the Druids than is to be found in the whole world besides and have saved from oblivion many of their religious rites in our initia∣tion to the first degree of masonry which otherwise would have slept in eternity These we seem to have mixed and tem∣pered with the principles of the Essenes  who are a sect as antient as the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt The philosophy of the Egyptians and the manners principles and customs of the Hebrews were introduced to this land by the Phoenicians and make a part of our profession so far as they are adapted to the worship of NATURE'S GREAT AU∣THOR unpolluted by idolatry  We hold our grand festival on the day of ST JOHN which is Midsummerday in which we celebrate that season when the sun is in its greatest altitude and in the midst of its prolisic powers the great type of the omnipotence of the Deity  The famous lawyer Lord Cook in his Treatise on Littleton's Institutes says  Prudent antiquity did for more solem∣nity and better memory and observa∣tion of that which is to be done ex∣press substances under ceremonies  I have pointed out to you that the FURNITURES of the LODGE are em∣blems excitive of morality and good go∣vernmentPRUDENCE shines in the  centre or if you would apply this object to more sacred principles it represents the blazing star which conducted the wise men to Bethlehem and proclaimed the presence of the SON OF GOD It is here placed in your view that you may remember to work out the works of salvation which is at handand that you may pass on in acts of strict propriety with greater alacrity the TASSALATA or MOSAICWORK intimates to you the chequered diversity and uncertainty of human affairs that you may not set your hearts on the things of this world but lay up your treasures where the rust cannot deface their polish and lustre nei∣ther can the moth despoil the garment for the wedding feast  To protect and support us under the infirmities of nature and lead us to the paths of propriety the BOOK OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE is in the lodgethe MASTER circumscribes you as with the sweep of the COMPASS and the SQUARE is your trial whereby you shall prove the rectitude and uniformity of your manners  In my next Lecture I demonstrated to you that to be a worthy servant in the temple of God you must be cloathed with INNOCENCE that your service may stand in approbation and you may be accepted in heavenOur jewels are emblems of that good working in a moral mind which adorns the life of man FAITH CHARITY AND UPRIGHT∣NESS  In the succeeding Lecture I have led you to a discernment of the second race of the servants of God under the MO∣SAIC LAW the truth being stripped of the errors of idolatryThis stage is a∣dapted to the second gradation of ma∣sonry  I have argued for the propriety of our adopting GEOMETRY in this society as being a science from whence the mighty powers of God are revealed and demon∣strated to mankind  Afterwards I attended to the estate of the worshippers of the Deity under the  corruptions of the house of Israel and under the rottenness of the old lawIn this assembly of christians it is in no wise requisite to attempt an argument on the necessity which there was upon earth for a Mediator and Saviour for manin the rubbish superstitions ceremonials and filth of the Jewish temple the true wor∣ship of God was buried and confounded and INNOCENCE became only the or∣naments of its monumentThen it was that the Divinity looking down with an eye of commiseration on the deplorable state of man in his mercy and love sent us a Preceptor and Mediator who should teach to us the doctrine of regeneration and raise us from the sepulchre of sin to which the human race had resigned them∣selveshe gave to us the precepts of that acceptable service wherewith his Father should be well pleased he made the sacrifice of expiation and becoming the firstfruits of them that slept mani∣fested to mankind the resurrection of the body and the life everlastingIn the MASTER'S ORDER this whole doctrine is symbolized and the christian conduct is by types presented to us  We MASONS have adopted three par∣ticular characteristics SECRECY CHA∣RITY AND BROTHERLY LOVE I have explained my sense of these three great duties and of what especial import they are of to MASONS or to men who have separated themselves from the rest of mankind and professed they are ser∣vants of HIM WHO RULETH IN THE MIDST OF HEAVEN  Lastly I have attempted to examine into the origin of our society and in many instances wand'ring without evi∣dence I have been left to probability in conjecture onlyIt doth not now seem material to us what our originals and predecessors were if we occupy ourselves in the true SPIRIT OF MASONRY in that divine spirit which inspired the patriarchs when they erected altars unto the Lord if we are true servants to our king faithful and true to our chartered liberties christians in profession and in practice and to each other and mankind in general affectionate and upright  Whether MASONS were originally builders or religious it matters not to us in this agecomparing these works with the righteousness to which I have exhorted you the honor of the antiquity would be swallowed up in the virtues of practice and in the splendor of that LIGHT OF ACCEPTATION which at once proclaims to the world that we are servants of the true God who saves our souls alive  If our ceremonies mean not the matter which I have expressed if they imply not the moral and religious principles which I have endeavoured to unveil I ask you MASONS what they do imply import or indicate  Can we presume so many learned and noble personages would for many suc∣cessive ages have been steady members of this fraternity if the mysteries were unimportant and the ceremonies unin∣telligibleIt cannot be take away their SPIRIT and they become ridi∣culous  Hath it been for ages a maxim of foolish sport to induce men to a silly snare in which the guide having been entrapped into ridicule longs to laugh at another for revengeIt is too ridicu∣lous to be presumedBesides if it was only so the snare might be formed and ornamented with simple things and there was no need to introduce sacred matters into the deviceThis renders the con∣jecture so absurd that it will bear no fur∣ther animadversions  We MASONS profess that we are pilgrims in progression from the EAST  The Almighty planted a garden in the EAST wherein he placed the perfection of human nature the first man full of innocence and divine knowledge and full of honor even bearing the image of God  Learning had its first progression from the EAST after the flood the Egyptians were the first devisers of the zodiac and the first discerners of the wisdom of the great ARCHITECT OF THE WORLD  in the revolutions of the heavens they were the first projectors of the science of GEOMETRY  In regard to the doctrine of our Sa∣viour and the christian revelation it pro∣ceeded from the EAST  The star which proclaimed the birth of the Son of God appeared in the EAST  The EAST was an expression used by the prophets to denote the Redeemer  From thence it may well be conceived that we should profess our progress to be from thence if we profess by being MA∣SONS that we are a society of the ser∣vants of that Divinity whose abode is with the Father coeternal in the centre of the heavens  But if we profess no such matter then why should not we have alledged our progress to have been from the north and the regions of chaos and darkness  But I will now my brethren forbear all further argument and close the la∣bours of my year with a sincere exhorta∣tion that you will continue to act in this society as upright and religious men that you will exert yourselves in the pro∣motion of its honorand let the wicked and ignorant revile never so maliciously be strenuous in your duties as MASONS and as BRETHRENexercise your be∣nevolence with openness of heart and your charity with cordiality and not as hypocriteswith attention endeavour to arrive at the utmost knowledge of your PROFESSION the end of which I pre∣sume to proclaim to you is to work out THE WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS  THE END  APPENDIX  A  LETTER  from the learned Mr  JOHN LOCKE  to the Right Hon  THOMAS  Earl of  PEMBROKE  with an old  MANUSCRIPT  on the Subject of  FREEMASONRY  MY LORD  th  May    I Have at length by the help of Mr Collins procured a copy of that M S in the Bodleian library which you were so curious to see and in obedience to your Lordship's commands I herewith send it to you Most of the notes an∣nexed to it are what I made yesterday for the reading of my lady Masham who is become so fond of masonry as to say that she now more than ever wishes her∣self a man that she might be capable of admission into the fraternity  The M S of which this is a copy ap∣pears to be about years old yet as your Lordship will observe by the title it is itself a copy of one yet more ancient by about years for the original is said to have been the handwriting of  K Henry VI Where that prince had it is at present an uncertainty but it seems to me to be an examination taken per∣haps before the king of some one of the brotherhood of masons among whom he entered himself as it is said when he came out of his minority and thence∣forth put a stop to a persecution that had been raised against them But I must not detain your Lordship longer by my pre∣face from the thing itself  I know not what effect the sight of this old  The paper alluded to by Mr Locke is the immediately following one  paper may have upon your Lord∣ship but for my own part I cannot deny that it has so much raised my curiosity as to induce me to enter myself into the fraternity which I am determined to do if I may be admitted the next time I go to London and that will be shortly  I am  My LORD  Your  LORDSHIP'S  most obedient And most humble

Henry VIII at the dissolution of mo∣nasteries to search for and save such books and records as were valuable among them He was a man of great labour and industry  HIS HIGHNESSE meaning the said king Henry VIII Our kings had not then the title of majesty  What mote ytt be That is what may this mystery of masonry be The answer imports that it consists in natural mathematical and mechanical knowledge Some part of which as appears by what follows the masons pretend to have taught the rest of mankind and some part they still conceal  Fyrste menne yn the este c It should seem by this that masons be∣lieve there were men in the east before Adam who is called "the ffyrste manne of the weste" and that arts and sciences began in the east Some authors of great note for learning have been of the same opinion and it is certain that Europe and Africa which in respect to Asia may be called western countries were wild and savage long after arts and politeness of manners were in great perfection in China and the Indies  The Venetians c In the times of monkish ignorance it is no wonder that the Phenicians should be mistaken for the Venetians Or perhaps if the people  were not taken one for the other simili∣tude of sound might deceive the clerk who first took down the examination The Phenicians were the greatest voyagers among the ancients and were in Europe thought to be the inventors of letters which perhaps they brought from the east with other arts  Peter Gower This must be ano∣ther mistake of the writer I was puz∣zled at first to guess who Peter Gower should be the name being perfectly English or how a Greek should come by such a name But as soon as I thought of Pythagoras I could scarce forbear smi∣ling to find that philosopher had under∣gone a metempsycosis he never dreamt of We need only consider the French pronunciation of his name Pythagore that is Petagore to conceive how easily such a mistake might be made by an un∣learned clerk That Pythagoras travelled for knowledge into Egypt c is known to all the learned and that he was initi∣ated into several different orders of priests who in those days kept all their learning secret from the vulgar is as well known  Pythagoras also made every geometrical theorem a secret and admitted only such to the knowledge of them as had first undergone a five years silence He is supposed to be the inventor of the th proposition of the first book of Euclid for which in the joy of his heart it is said he sacrificed a hecatomb He also knew the true system of the world lately revived by Copernicus and was certainly a most wonderful man See his life by DION HAL  GRECIA MAGNA a part of Italy formerly so called in which the Greeks had settled a large colony  Wyseacre This word at present signifies simpleton but formerly had a quite contrary meaning Weisager in the old Saxon is philosopher wiseman or wizard and having been frequently used ironically at length came to have a direct meaning in the ironical sense Thus Duns Scotus a man famed for the subtilty and acuteness of his under∣standing has by the same method of  irony given a general name to modern dunces  Groton Groton is the name of a place in England The place here meant is Crotona a city of Grecia Magna which in the time of Pythagoras was very populous  Fyrste made The word MADE I suppose has a particular meaning among the masons perhaps it signifies initiated  Maconnes haueth communyca∣tedde c This paragraph hath some∣thing remarkable in it It contains a justification of the secrecy so much boasted of by masons and so much blamed by others asserting that they have in all ages discovered such things as might be useful and that they conceal such only as would be hurtful either to the world or themselves What these secrets are we see afterwards  The artes agricultura c It seems a bold pretence this of the masons  that they have taught mankind all these arts They have their own authority for it and I know not how we shall dis∣prove them But what appears most odd is that they reckon religion among the arts  Arte of ffyndinge neue artes The art of inventing arts must certainly be a most useful art My lord Bacon's No∣vum Organum is an attempt towards somewhat of the same kind But I much doubt that if ever the masons had it they have now lost it since so few new arts have been lately invented and so many are wanted The idea I have of such an art is that it must be something proper to be applied in all the sciences generally as algebra is in numbers by the help of which new rules of arithmetic are and may be found  Preise It seems the masons have great regard to the reputation as well as the profit of their order since they make it one reason for not divulging an art in common that it may do honour to the possessors of it I think in this particular  they shew too much regard for their own society and too little for the rest of mankind  Arte of keepyng secrettes What kind of an art this is I can by no means imagine But certainly such an art the masons must have For though as some people suppose they should have no se∣cret at all even that must be a secret which being discovered would expose them to the highest ridicule and there∣fore it requires the utmost caution to conceal it  Arte of chaunges I know not what this means unless it be the trans∣mutation of metals  Facultye of Abrac Here I am utterly in the dark  Universelle longage of maconnes An universal language has been much desired by the learned of many ages It is a thing rather to be wished than hoped for But it seems the masons pretend to have such a thing among them If it be  true I guess it must be something like the language of the Pantomimes among the ancient Romans who are said to be able by signs only to express and deliver any oration intelligibly to men of all na∣tions and languages A man who has all these arts and advantages is certainly in a condition to be envied But we are told that this is not the case with all masons for though these arts are among them and all have a right and an oppor∣tunity to know them yet some want ca∣pacity and others industry to acquire them However of all their arts and secrets that which I most desire to know is "The skylle of becommynge gude and parfyghte" and I wish it were commu∣nicated to all mankind since there is nothing more true than the beautiful sen∣tence contained in the last answer "That the better men are the more they love one another" Virtue having in itself something so amiable as to charm the hearts of all that behold it  A GLOSSARY  To explain
