 EVERYBODY'S Business IS NOBODY'S Business  EVERYBODY'S Business IS NOBODY'S Business OR Private Abuses Publick Grievances EXEMPLIFIED In the Pride Insolence and Exorbitant Wages of our WOMENSERVANTS FOOTMEN  c  WITH A PROPOSAL for amendment of the same as also for clearing the Streets of those Vermin call'd SHOECLEANERS and substituting in their stead many Thousands of Industrious Poor now ready to starve With divers other Hints of great Use to the Publick  Humbly submitted to the Consideration of our Legislature and the careful perusal of all Masters and Mistresses of Families  By ANDREW MORETON  Esq  LONDON Sold by T WARNER at the  Black Boy  in  PaterNosterRow  A DODD without  TempleBar  and E NUTT at the  RoyalExchange  Price Six Pence  EVERYBODY'S Business IS NOBODY'S Business  _THIS is a Proverb so common in Everybody's Mouth that I wonder Nobody has yet thought it worth while to draw proper Inferences from it and expose those little Abuses which tho' they seem trifling and as it were scarce worth Consideration yet by Insensible Degrees they may become of injurious Consequence to the Publick like some Diseases whose first Symptoms are only trifling Disorders yet by Continuance and Progression their last Periods terminate in the Destruction of the whole Humane Fabrick  In Contradiction therefore to this general Rule and out of sincere Love and Wellmeaning to the Publick give me leave to enumerate  the Abuses insensibly crept in among us and the Inconveniences daily arising from the Insolence and Intrigues of our Servant Wenches who by their caballing together have made their Party so considerable that Everybody cries out against 'em and yet to verify the Proverb Nobody has thought of or at least proposed a Remedy altho' such an Undertaking mean as it seems to be I hope will one Day be thought worthy the Consideration of our King Lords and Commons  Women Servants are now so scarce that from and Shillings a Year their Wages are increased of late to and Pounds  per Annum  and upwards insomuch that an ordinary Tradesman cannot well keep one but his Wife who might be useful in his Shop or Business must do the Drudgery of Houshold Affairs and all this because our Servant Wenches are so puff'd up with Pride now a Days that they never think they go fine enough It is a hard Matter to know the Mistress from the Maid by their Dress nay very often the Maid shall be much the finer of the two Our Woollen Manufacture suffers much by this for now nothing but Silks and Sattins will go down with our Kitchen Wenches and it is to support this intollerable Pride that they have insensibly raised their Wages to such a Heighth as was never known in any Age or Nation but this  Let us trace this from the beginning and suppose a Person has a Servant Maid sent him out of the Country at Shillings or Pounds a Year The Girl has scarce been a Week nay a Day in her Service but a Committee of Servant Wenches are appointed to examine her who advise her to raise her Wages or give warning to encourage her to which the HerbWoman or ChandlerWoman or some other old Intelligencer provides her a Place of or Pounds a Year this sets Madam cockahoop and she thinks of nothing now but Vails and high Wages and so gives warning from Place to Place 'till she has got her Wages up to the tiptop  Her Neat's Leathern Shoes are now transform'd into lac'd Shoes with high Heels her Yarn Stockings are turn'd into fine Worsted ones with silk Clocks and her high Wooden Pattens are kickt away for Leathern Clogs she must have a Hoop too as well as her Mistress and her poor scanty LinseyWoolsey Petticoat is changed into a good Silk one or Yards wide at the least Not to carry the Description farther in short plain Country  Joan  is now turn'd into a fine  London  Madam can drink Tea take Snuff and carry her self as high as the best  If she is tollerably handsome and has any share of Cunning the Apprentice or her Master's Son is entic'd away and ruin'd  by her Thus many good Families are impoverished and disgrac'd by these Pert Sluts who taking the Advantage of a Young Man's Simplicity and unruly Desires draw many heedless Youths nay some of good Estates into their Snares and of this we have but too many Instances  Some more artful shall conceal their Condition and palm themselves on Young Fellows for Gentlewomen and great Fortunes How many Families have been ruin'd by these Ladies When the Father or Master of the Family preferring the flirting Airs of a young wanton prinkt up Strumpet to the artless sincerity of a plain grave and good Wife has given his Desires aloose and destroy'd Soul Body Family and Estate But they are very favourable if they wheedle Nobody into Matrimony but only make a Present of a small live Creature no bigger than a Bastard to some of the Family no matter who gets it when a Child is born it must be kept  Our Sessions Papers of late are crowded with Instances of Servant Maids robbing their Places this can be only attributed to their devilish Pride for their whole Enquiry now a Days is how little they shall do how much they shall have  But all this while they make so little reserve that if they fall sick the Parish must  keep 'em if they are out of Place they must prostitute their Bodies or starve so that from chopping and changing they generally proceed to whoring and thieving and this is the Reason why our Streets swarm with Strumpets  Thus many of 'em rove from Place to Place from BawdyHouse to Service and from Service to BawdyHouse again ever unsettled and never easy nothing being more common than to find these Creatures one Week in a good Family and the next in a Brothel This Amphibious Life makes 'em fit for neither for if the Bawd uses them ill away they trip to Service and if their Mistress gives 'em a wry Word whip they're at a BawdyHouse again so that in Effect they neither make good Whores or good Servants  Those who are not thus slippery in the Tail are light of Finger and of these the most pernicious are those who beggar you Inchmeal If a Maid is a downright Thief she strips you at once and you know your Loss but your retail Pilferers waste you insensibly and tho' you hardly miss it yet your Substance shall decay to such a degree that you must have a very good Bottom indeed not to feel the ill Effects of such Moths in your Family  Tea Sugar Wine  c  or any such trifling Commodities are reckoned no Thefts if they do not directly take your Pewter from your Shelf or your Linnen from your Drawers they are very Honest What harm is there say they in cribbing a little Matter for a Junket or a merry Bout or so Nay there are those that when they are sent to Market for one Joint of Meat shall take up two on their Master's Account and leave one by the Way for some of these Maids are very charitable and can make a shift to maintain a small Family with what they can Purloin from their Masters and Mistresses  If you send 'em with ready Money they turn Factors and take  d  or  d  in the Shilling Brokeridge And here let me take Notice of one very heinous Abuse not to say petty Felony which is practiced in most of the great Families about Town and that is when the Tradesmen gives the Housekeeper or other commanding Servant a Penny or two Pence in the Shilling or so much in the Pound for every Thing they send in which from thence is called Poundage  This in my Opinion is the greatest of Villanies and ought to incur some Punishment yet nothing is more common and our topping Tradesmen who seem otherwise to stand mightily on their Credit make this but a Matter of Course and Custom  If I don't says one another will for the Servant is sure to pick a Hole in the Persons Coat who shall not pay Contribution Thus this wicked Practice is carried on and wink'd at while receiving of stolen Goods and confederating with Felons which is not a jot worse is so openly cry'd out against and so severely punish'd  And yet if a Master or Mistress enquire after any Thing missing they must be sure to place their Words in due Form or Madam huffs and flings about at a strange Rate What would you make a Thief of her Who would live with such mistrustful Folks Thus you are obliged to hold your Tongue and sit down quietly by your loss for fear of offending your Maid forsooth  Again if your Maid shall maintain one two or more Persons from your Table whether they are her poor Relations Country Folk or Servants out of Place or whether they are Shoecleaners Charewomen Porters or any other of her menial Servants who do her Ladyships Drudgery and go of her Errands you must not grumble or complain at your Expence or ask What is become of such a Thing or such a Thing altho' it might never so reasonably be supposed that it was altogether impossible to have so much expended in your Family but hold your Tongue  for Peace sake or Madam will say You grudge her Victuals and expose you to the last Degree all over the Neighbourhood  Thus have they a Salve for every Sore cheat you to your Face and insult you into the Bargain nor can you help your self without exposing yourself or putting yourself into a Passion  Another great Abuse crept in among us is the giving of Vails to Servants this was intended originally as an Incouragement to willing and handy Servants but by Custom and Corruption it is now grown to be a Thorn in our Sides and like other good Things abused does more hurt than good for now they make it a Perquisite a material Part of their Wages nor must their Master give a Supper but the Maid expects the Guests should pay for it nay sometimes through the Nose Thus have they spirited People up to this unnecessary and burthensome Piece of Generosity unknown to our ForeFathers who only gave Gifts to Servants at  Christmass  tide which Custom is yet kept up into the Bargain insomuch that a Maid shall have Pounds  per Annum  in a Gentleman's or Merchant's Family And if her Master is a Man of a free Spirit and receives much Company she very often doubles her Wages by her Vails thus having Meat Drink Washing and Lodging for her Labour  she throws her whole Income upon her Back and by this Means looks more like the Mistress of the Family than the ServantWench  And now we have mention'd washing I would ask some good Housewifely Gentlewomen If ServantMaids wearing printed Linnens Cottons and other Things of that Nature which require frequent washing do not by enhauncing the Article of Soap add more to Housekeeping than the Generality of People would imagine And yet these Wenches cry out against great Washes when their own unnecessary Dabs are very often the Occasion  But the greatest Abuse of all is that these Creatures are become their own Lawgivers nay I think they are ours too tho' Nobody would imagine that such a Set of Slatterns should bamboozle a whole Nation But it is neither better or worse they hire themselves to you by their own Rule  That is a Month's Wages or a Month's Warning if they don't like you they will go away the next Day help yourself how you can if you don't like them you must give them a Month's Wages to get rid of them  This Custom of Warning as practis'd by our MaidServants is now become a great Inconvenience to Masters and Mistresses You  must carry your Dish very upright or Miss forsooth gives you Warning and you are either left destitute or to seek for a Servant So that generally speaking you are seldom or never fix'd but always at the Mercy of every new Servant to divulge your FamilyAffairs to inspect your private Life and treasure up the Sayings of yourself and Friends A very great Confinement and much complain'd of in most Families  Thus have these Wenches by their continual Plotting and Cabals united themselves into a formidable Body and got the WhipHand of their Betters they make their own Terms with us and two Servants now will scarce undertake the Work which one might perform with Ease yet notwithstanding they have rais'd their Wages to a most exorbitant Pitch and I doubt not if there be not a Stop put to their Career but they will bring Wages up to twenty Pounds  per Annum  in time for they are much about half Way already  'Tis by these Means they run away with a great Part of our Money which might be better employ'd in Trade and what is worse by their insolent Behaviour their Pride in Dress and their exorbitant Wages they give Birth to the following Inconveniences  First  They set an ill Example to our Children our Apprentices our CovenantServants and other Dependants by their saucy and  insolent Behaviour their pert and sometimes abusive Answers their daring Defiance of Correction and many other Insolencies which Youth are but too apt to imitate    dly  By their Extravagance in Dress they put our Wives and Daughters upon yet greater Excesses because they will as indeed they ought go finer than the Maid Thus the Maid striving to outdo the Mistress the Tradesman's Wife to outdo the Gentleman's Wife the Gentleman's Wife emulating the Lady and the Ladies one another it seems as if the whole Business of the female Sex were nothing but Excess of Pride and Extravagance in Dress    dly  The great Height to which WomenServants have brought their Wages makes a Mutiny among the MenServants and puts them upon raising their Wages too So that in a little Time our Servants will become our Partners nay probably run away with the better Part of our Profits and so make Servants of us  vice versa  And yet with all these Inconveniences we cannot possibly do without these Creatures let us therefore cease to talk of the Abuses arising from 'em and begin to think of redressing 'em I do not set up for a Lawgiver so shall lay down no certain Rules humbly submitting in all things to the Wisdom of our Legislature Therefore what I offer shall be under Correction  and upon Conjecture my utmost Ambition being but to give some Hint to remedy this growing Evil and leave the Prosecution to abler Heads  And first it would be necessary to settle and limit their Wages from forty and fifty Shillings to four and five Pounds  per Annum  that is to say according to their Merits and Capacities For Example a young unexperienc'd Servant to have  s per Annum  'till she qualifies herself for a larger Sum a Servant who can do all HousholdWork or as the good Women term it can take her Work and leave her Work should have four Pounds  per Annum  and those who have liv'd seven Years in one Service should ever after demand five Pounds  per Annum  for I would very fain have some particular Encouragements and Privileges given to such Servants who should continue long in a Place it would incite a Desire to please and cause an Emulation very beneficial to the Publick  I have heard of an ancient Charity in the Parish of St  Clement'sDanes  where a Sum of Money or Estate is left out of the Interest or Income of which such MaidServants who have liv'd in that Parish seven Years in one Service if they please to demand it receive a Reward of ten Pounds a Piece  This is a noble Benefaction and shews the publick Spirit of the Donor but Everybody's  Business is Nobody's for I have not heard that such Reward has been paid to any Servant of late Years a thousand pities that a Gift of that Nature should sink in Oblivion and not be kept up as an Example to incite all Parishes to do the like  The  Romans  had a Law call'd  Jus Trium Liberorum  by which every Man who had been Father of three Children had particular Honours and Privileges This incited the Youth to quit a dissolute single Life and become Fathers of Families to the Support and Glory of the Empire  In Imitation of this most excellent Law I would have such Servants who should continue many Years in one Service meet with singular Esteem and Reward  The Apparel of our WomenServants should be next regulated that we may know the Mistress from the Maid I remember I was once put very much to the Blush being at a Friend's House and by him requir'd to salute the Ladies I kiss'd the ChamberJade in to the bargain for she was as well dress'd as the best But I was soon undeceiv'd by a general Titter that gave me the utmost Confusion nor can I believe myself the only Person who has made such a Mistake  Things of this Nature would be avoided if our ServantMaids were to wear Liveries as our Footmen do or if they were oblig'd to  go in a Dress suitable to their Station What should ail them but a Jacket and Petticoat of good Yardwide Stuff or Callimanco might keep 'em decent and Warm  Our Charity Children are distinguish'd by their Dress why then may not our Women Servants Why may they not be made frugal  per  force and not put all on their Backs but save something against a rainy Day I am therefore entirely against any Servants wearing of Silks Laces and other superfluous Finery it sets them above themselves and makes their Mistresses contemptible in their Eyes I am handsomer than my Mistress says a young prink'd up Baggage what pity 'tis I should be her Servant I go as well dress'd or better than she This makes the Girl take the first Offer to be made a Whore and there is a good Servant spoil'd whereas were her Dress but suitable to her Condition it would teach her Humility and put her in Mind of her Duty  Besides the fear of spoiling their Cloaths makes them afraid of HousholdWork so that in a little Time we shall have none but Chambermaids and NurseryMaids and of this let me give one Instance My Family is composed of my self and Sister a Man and a Maid and being without a Servant a young Wench came to hire her self as a Servant the Man was gone out and my Sister above  Stairs so I open'd the Door my self and this Person presented herself to my View dress'd compleatly and more like a Visitor than a ServantMaid she not knowing me ask'd for my Sister Pray Madam said I be pleas'd to walk into the Parlour and she shall wait on you presently Accordingly I handed Madam in who took it very cordially After some Apology I left her alone for a Minute or two while I stupid Wretch runs up to my Sister and told her there was a Gentlewoman below come to visit her Dear Brother said she don't leave her alone go down and entertain her while I dress my self Accordingly down I went and talk'd of indifferent Affairs with Madam mean while my Sister dress'd herself all over again not being willing to be seen in an Undress At last she came down dress'd as clean as her Visitor but how great was my Surprize when I found my fine Lady a common ServantWench  My Sister understanding what she was began to ask what Wages she expected She modestly asked but eight Pounds a Year The next Question was what Work she could do to deserve such Wages To this she answer'd That she could clean a House or dress a common FamilyDinner But cannot you wash reply'd my Sister or get up Linnen She answer'd in the Negative  and said She would undertake neither nor would she go into any Family that did not put out their Linnen to wash and hire a Charewoman to scour She desir'd to see the House and after having carefully survey'd it said The Work was too hard for her nor could she undertake it This put my Sister beyond all Patience and me into the greatest Admiration Young Woman said she you have made a Mistake I want a HouseMaid and you are a ChamberMaid No Madam reply'd she I am not NeedleWoman enough for that And yet you ask Pounds a Year reply'd my Sister Yes Madam said she nor shall I bate a Farthing Then get you gone for a lazy impudent Baggage said I you want to be a Boarder and not a Servant Have you a Fortune or Estate that you dress at that Rate No Sir said she but I hope I may wear what I work for without Offence What you work for Interrupted my Sister why you don't seem willing to undertake any You will not wash or scour you cannot dress a Dinner for Company you are no NeedleWoman and our little House of two Rooms on a Floor is too much for you For God's sake what can you do Madam reply'd she pertly I know my Business and don't fear a Service there are more Places than Parish Churches if you wash at Home you should have a LaundryMaid  if you give Entertainments you must have a CookMaid if you have any NeedleWork you should have a ChamberMaid and such a House as this is enough for a HouseMaid in all Conscience  I was pleas'd at the Wit and astonish'd at the Impudence of the Girl and so dismiss'd her with Thanks for her Instructions assuring her that when I kept four Maids she should be HouseMaid if she pleas'd Were a Servant to do my Business with chearfulness I should not grudge at five or six Pounds  per Annum  Nor would I be so unchristian as to put more upon any one than they can bear but to pray and pay too is the Devil and it is very hard that I must keep four Servants or none  In great Families indeed where many Servants are requir'd these Distinctions of ChamberMaid HouseMaid CookMaid LaundryMaid NurseryMaid  c  are requisite to the End that each may take her particular Business and many Hands may make the Work light But for a private Gentleman of a small Fortune to be oblig'd to keep so many Idle Jades when one might do the Business is intollerable and matter of great Grievance  I cannot close this Discourse without a gentle Admonition and Reproof to some of my own Sex I mean those Gentlemen who  give themselves unnecessary Airs and cannot go to see a Friend but they must kiss and slop the Maid and all this is done with an Air of Gallantry forsooth and must not be resented Nay some Gentlemen are so silly that they shall carry on an underhand Affair with their Friend's ServantMaid to their own Disgrace and the Ruin of many a young Creature Nothing is more base and ungenerous yet nothing more common and withal so little taken Notice of  D me Jack  says one Friend to another  this Maid of yours is a pretty Girl you do so and so to her by Gd  This makes the ServantMaid Pert Vain and Impudent and spoils many a good Servant  What Gentleman will descend to this low Way of Intrigue when he shall consider that he has a FootBoy or an Apprentice for his Rival and that he is seldom or never admitted but when they have been his Tasters And the Fool of Fortune tho' he comes at the latter End of the Feast yet pays the whole Reckoning and so indeed would I have all such silly Cullies serv'd  If I must have an Intrigue let it be with a Woman that shall not shame me I would never go into the Kitchen when the ParlourDoor was open We are forbidden at  Highgate  to kiss the Maid when we may kiss the Mistress Why then will Gentlemen descend  so low by too much familiarity with these Creatures to bring themselves into Contempt  I have been at Places where the Maid has been so dizzied with these idle Compliments that she has mistook one Thing for another and not regarded her Mistress in the least but put on all the flirting Airs imaginable But this Behaviour is no where so much complain'd of as in Taverns CoffeeHouses and Places of publick Resort where there are handsome BarKeepers  c  These Creatures being puff'd up with the fulsome flattery of a set of FleshFlies that are continually buzzing about 'em carry themselves with the utmost Insolence imaginable insomuch that you must speak to them with a great deal of Deference or you are sure to be affronted I was at a CoffeeHouse t'other Day where one of these Ladies kept the Bar and had bespoke a Dish of RiceTea but Madam was so taken up with her Sparks that she had quite forgot it I spoke for it again and with some Temper but was answer'd after a most taunting Manner not without a toss of the Head a Contraction of the Nostrils and other Impertinencies too many to enumerate Seeing my self thus publickly insulted by such an Animal I could not chuse but shew my Resentment Woman said I sternly I want a Dish of RiceTea and not what your  Vanity and Impudence may imagine therefore treat me as a Gentleman and a Customer and serve me with what I call for and keep your impertinent Repartees and impudent Behaviour for the Coxcombs that swarm round your Bar and make you so vain of your blown Carcass And indeed I believe the Insolence of this Creature will ruin her Master at last by driving away Men of Sobriety and Business and making the Place a Den of Vagabonds and RakeHells  Gentlemen therefore ought to be very circumspect in their Behaviour and not undervalue themselves to ServantWenches who are but too apt to treat a Gentleman Ill when ever he puts himself into their Power  Let me now beg pardon for this Digression and return to my Subject by proposing some practicable Methods for regulating of Servants which whether they are followed or not yet if they afford Matter of Improvement and Speculation it will answer the Heighth of my Expectation and I will be the first who shall approve of whatever Improvements are made from this small Beginning  The first Abuse I would have reform'd is that Servants should be restrain'd from throwing themselves out of Place on every idle Vagary This might be remedied were all Contracts between Master and Servant to be  made before a Justice of the Peace or other proper Officer and a Memorandum thereof taken in Writing Nor should such Servant leave his or her Place for Men and Maids might come under the same Regulation 'till the Time agreed on be expir'd unless such Servant be misus'd or deny'd Necessaries or show some other reasonable Cause for their Discharge In that Case the Master or Mistress should be reprimanded or fin'd But if Servants misbehave themselves or leave their Places not being regularly discharg'd they ought to be amerc'd or punish'd But all those idle ridiculous Customs and Laws of their own making such as a Month's Wages or a Month's Warning and such like should be intirely set aside and abolish'd  When a Servant has serv'd the limited Time duly and faithfully they should be intitul'd to a Certificate as is practiced at present in the WoolCombing Trade Nor should any Person hire a Servant without a Certificate or other proper Security A Servant without a Certificate should be deem'd a Vagrant And a Master or Mistress ought to assign very good Reasons when they object against giving a Servant his or her Certificate  And tho' to avoid Prolixity I have not mention'd Footmen particularly in the foregoing Discourse Yet the Complaints alledg'd against the Maids are as well Masculine as  Feminine and very applicable to our Gentlemen's Gentlemen I would therefore have them under the very same Regulations and as they are Fellow Servants would not make Fish of one and Flesh of the other since daily Experience teaches us that  Never a Barrel the Better Herring  The next great Abuse among us is that under the Notion of cleaning our Shoes above Ten Thousand Wicked Idle Pilfering Vagrants are permitted to patrol about our City and Suburbs These are call'd the  BlackGuard  who Black your Honour's Shoes and incorporate themselves under the Title of the  Worshipful Company of Jappanners  Were this all there were no hurt in it and the whole might terminate in a Jest But the mischief Ends not here they corrupt our Youth especially our MenServants Oaths and Impudence are their only Flowers of Rhetorick Gaming and Thieving are the principal Parts of their Profession but japanning the Pretence For Example a Gentleman keeps a Servant who among other Things is to clean his Masters Shoes but our Gentlemen's Servants are above it now aDays and your Man's Man performs the Office for which  piece of Service you pay double and treble especially if you keep a Table For you are well off if the Jappanner has no more than his own Diet from your Table  I have often observ'd these Rascals sneaking from Gentlemen's Doors with Wallets or Hats full of good Victuals which they either carry to their Trulls or sell for a Trifle By this Means our Butcher's our Baker's our Poulterer's and Cheesemonger's Bills are monstrously exaggerated Not to mention Candles just lighted which sell for five Pence a Pound many other Perquisites best known to themselves and the pilfering Villains their Confederates  Add to this that their continual Gaming sets Servants upon their Wits to supply this Extravagance tho' at the same Time the Master's Pocket pays for it and the Time which should be spent in a Gentleman's Service is loiter'd away among these Rakehells Insomuch that half our Messages are inefectual the Time intended being often expir'd before the Message is deliver'd  How many and frequent Robberies are committed by these Jappanners And to how many more are they Confederates SilverSpoons Spurs and other small Pieces of Plate are every Day missing and very often sound upon these sort of Gentlemen Yet are they permitted to the shame of all our good  Laws and the Scandal of our most excellent Government to lurk about our Streets to debauch our Servants and Apprentices to support an infinite Number of scandalous shameless Trulls yet more wicked then themselves For not a jack among 'em but must have his Gill  By whom such Indecencies are daily acted even in our open Streets as are very offensive to the Eyes and Ears of all sober Persons and even abominable in a Christian Country  In any Riot or other Disturbance these Sparks are always the foremost for most among 'em can turn their Hands to picking of Pockets to run away with Goods from a Fire or other publick Confusion to snatch any Thing from a Woman or Child to strip a House when the Door is open or any other Branch of a Thief's Profession  In short it is a Nursery for Thieves and Villains modest Women are every Day insulted by them and their Strumpets and such Children as run about the Streets or such Servants as go on Errands do but too frequently bring home some Scraps of their beastly profane Wit insomuch that the Conversation of our lower Rank of People runs only upon Bawdy and Blasphemy notwithstanding our Societies for Reformation and our Laws in force against Profaness For this lazy Life gets them many Proselites their  Numbers daily increasing by runaway Apprentices and FootBoys insomuch that it is a very hard Matter for a Gentleman to get him a Servant or for a Tradesman to find an Apprentice  Innumerable other Mischiefs accrue and others will spring up from this Race of Catterpillars who must be swept from out our Streets or we shall be overrun with all manner of Wickedness  But the Subject is so low that it becomes disagreeable even to my self give me leave therefore to propose a Way to clear the Streets of these Vermin and to substitute as many honest industrious Persons in their stead who are now starving for want of Bread while these execrable Villains live though in Rags and Nastiness yet in Plenty and Luxury  I therefore humbly propose that these Vagabonds be put immediately under the Command and Inspection of such TaskMasters as the Government shall appoint and that they be employ'd punish'd and rewarded according to their Capacities and Demerits that is to say the industrious and docible to Woolcombing and other Parts of the Woollen Manufacture where Hands are wanted as also to Husbandry and other Parts of Agriculture  For it is evident that there are scarce Hands enow in the Country to carry on either of these Affairs Now these Vagabonds might not only by this Means be kept out of Harm's Way but be render'd serviceable to the Nation Nor is there any need of transporting 'em beyond Seas for if any are refractory they should be sent to our Stannaries and other Mines to our CoalWorks and other Places where hard Labour is requir'd And here I must offer one Thing never yet thought of or proposed by any and that is the keeping in due Repair the Navigation of the River  Thames  so useful to our Trade in general And yet of late Years such vast Hills of Sand are gathered together in several Parts of the River as are very prejudicial to its Navigation One of which is near  LondonBridge  another near  WhiteHall  and another near  Battersea  These two last in particular are of very great Hindrance to the Navigation And indeed the Removal of them ought to be a National Concern which I humbly propose may be thus effected  The rebellious Part of these Vagabonds as also other Thieves and Offenders should be form'd in Bodies under the Command of proper Officers and under the Guard and Awe of our Soldiery These should every Day  at low Water carry away these SandHills and remove every other Obstruction to the Navigation of this most excellent and useful River  It may be objected that the BallastMen might do this and that as fast as the Hills are taken away they would gather together again or that the Watermen might do it To the first I answer that the BallastMen instead of taking from these Hills make Holes in other Places of the River which is the Reason so many young Persons are drown'd when swiming or bathing in the River Besides it is a Work for many Hands and of long Continuance so that BallastMen do more harm than good The second Objection is as silly as if I should never wash my self because I shall be dirty again and I think needs no other Answer And as to the third Objection the Watermen are not so publick spirited they live only from Hand to Mouth tho' not one of 'em but finds the Inconvenience of these Hills every Day being obliged to go a great Way round about for fear of running a ground Insomuch that in a few Years the Navigation of that Part of the River will be intirely obstructed Nevertheless every one of these GentlemenWatermen hopes it will last his Time and so they all cry the Devil take the hindmost but yet I judge it highly necessary  that this should be made a National Concern like  Dagenham  Breach and that these Hills be remov'd by some Means or other  And now I have mention'd Watermen give me leave to complain of the Insolencies and Exactions they daily commit on the River  Thames  and in particular this one Instance which cries aloud for Justice  A young Lady of Distinction in Company with her Brother a little Youth took a Pair of Oars at or near the Temple on  May  Day last and order'd the Men to carry them to  PepperAlleyStairs  One of the Fellows according to their usual Impertinence ask'd the Lady where she was going She answer'd near St  Olace  's Church Upon which he said she had better go through Bridge The Lady reply'd she had never gone through Bridge in her Life nor would she venture for an Hundred Guineas so commanded him once more to land her at  PepperAlleyStairs  Notwithstanding which in spight of her Fears Threats and Commands nay in spight of the Persuasion of his Fellow he forc'd her through  London  Bridge which frighten'd her beyond Expression and to mend the matter he oblig'd her to pay  are and mobb'd her into the Bargain  To resent which Abuse Application was made to the Hall the Fellow summon'd and the Lady order'd to attend which she did waiting there all the Morning and appointed to call again in the Afternoon She came accordingly but they told her the Fellow had been there and was gone so they appointed another  Friday  She attended again but to the same Purpose Nor have they yet produc'd the Man but tir'd out the Lady who has spent above ten Shillings in Coachhire been abus'd and baffled into the Bargain  It is pity therefore that there are not Commissioners for Watermen as there are for HackneyCoachmen or that Justices of the Peace might not inflict bodily Penalties on Watermen thus offending But while Watermen are Watermen's Judges I shall laugh at those who carry their Complaints to the Hall  The usual Plea in behalf of abusive Watermen is that they are drunk ignorant or poor but will that satisfy the Party aggreiv'd or defer the Offender from reoffending Whereas were the Offenders sent to the House of Correction and there punish'd or sentenc'd to work at the SandHills aforemention'd for a Time suitable to the Nature of their Crimes the Terror of such Punishments might make them fearful of offending to the great Quiet of the Subject  Now it will be ask'd How shall we have our Shoes clean'd or how are these industrious Poor to be maintain'd To this I answer that the Places of these Vagabonds may be very well supply'd by great Numbers of ancient Persons poor Widows and others who have not enough from their respective Parishes to maintain 'em These poor People I would have authoriz'd and station'd by the Justices of the Peace or other Magistrates Each of these should have a particular Walk or Stand and no other Shoecleaner should come into that Walk unless the Person misbehave and be remov'd Nor should any Person clean Shoes in the Streets but these authoriz'd Shoecleaners who should have some Mark of Distinction and be under the immediate Government of the Justices of the Peace  Thus would many Thousands of poor People be provided for without burthening their Parishes Some of these may earn a Shilling or two in a Day and none less then six Pence or thereabouts And least the old Jappanners should appear again in the shape of LinkBoys and so knock down Gentlemen in Drink and lead others out of the Way into dark remote Places where they either put out their Lights and rob 'em themselves or run away and leave 'em  to be pillag'd by others or perform any other Part of the thieving Function I would have no Person carry a Link for Hire but some of these industrious Poor and these not without some Ticket or Badge to let People know who they trust Thus would the Streets be clear'd Night and Day of these Vermin Nor would Oaths Skirmishes Blasphemy obscene Talk or other wicked Examples be so publick and frequent All gaming at Orange and GingerbreadBarrows should be abolish'd as also all Penny and half Penny Lotteries Thimbles and Balls  c  so frequent in  Moorfields LincolnsInnFields  c where Idle Fellows resort to play with Children and Apprentices and tempt them to steal their Parents or Masters Money  There is one admirable Custom in the City of  London  which I could wish were imitated in the City and Liberties of  Westminster  and Bills of Mortality which is no Porter can carry a Burthen or Letter in the City unless he be a TicketPorter Whereas out of the Freedompart of  London  any Person may take a Knot and turn Porter 'till he be intrusted with something of Value and then you never hear of him more This is very common and ought to be amended I would therefore have all Porters under some such Regulation as Coachmen Chairmen Carmen  c  a Man may then know whom he intrusts and not run the Risque of losing his Goods  c  Nay I would not have a Person carry a Basket in the Markets who is not subject to some such Regulation for very many Persons oftentimes lose their Dinner in sending their Meat home by Persons they know nothing of  Thus would all our Poor be station'd and a Man or Woman able to perform any of these Offices must either comply or be term'd an idle Vagrant and so sent to a Place where they shall be forc'd to work By this means Industry will be encourag'd Idleness punish'd and we shall be fam'd as well as happy for our Tranquility and Decorum  FINIS
