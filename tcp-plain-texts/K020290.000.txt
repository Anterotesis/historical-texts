 THE CRITIC OR  A Tragedy Rehearsed  A  Dramatic Piece  in three ACTS  as it is performed at the  THEATRE ROYAL in DRURY LANE  BY Richard Brinsley Sheridan Esq  r  LONDON Printed for T Becket Adelphi Strand MDCCLXXXI  TO Mrs GREVILLE  MADAM  IN requesting your permission to address the following pages to you which as they aim themselves to be critical require every protection and allowance that approving taste or friendly prejudice can give them I yet ventured to mention no other motive than the gratification of private friendship and esteem Had I suggested a hope that your implied approbation would give a sanction to their defects your particular reserve and dislike to the reputation of critical taste as well as of poetical talent would have made you refuse the protection of your name to such a purpose However I am not so ungrateful as now to attempt to combat this disposition in you I shall not here presume to argue that the present state of poetry claims and expects every assistance that taste and example can afford it nor endeavour to prove that a fastidious concealment of the most elegant productions of judgment and fancy is an ill return for the possession of those  endowmentsContinue to deceive yourself in the idea that you are known only to be eminently admired and regarded for the valuable qualities that attach private friendships and the graceful talents that adorn conversation Enough of what you have written has stolen into full public notice to answer my purpose and you will perhaps be the only person conversant in elegant literature who shall read this address and not perceive that by publishing your particular approbation of the following drama I have a more interested object than to boast the true respect and regard with which  I have the honour to be  MADAM  Your very sincere And obedient humble servant R B SHERIDAN  PROLOGUE  By the Honorable RICHARD FITZPATRICK  THE Sister Muses whom these realms obey  Who o'er the Drama hold divided sway  Sometimes by evil counsellors 'tis said  Like earthborn potentates have been misled  In those gay days of wickedness and wit  When Villiers criticiz'd what Dryden writ  The Tragick Queen to please a tasteless crow'd  Had learn'd to bellow rant and roar so loud  That frighten'd Nature her best friend before  The blust'ring beldam's company forswore  Her comic Sister who had wit 'tis true  With all her merits had her failings too  And would sometimes in mirthful moments use  A style too flippant for a wellbred Muse  Then female modesty abash'd began  To seek the friendly refuge of the fan  Awhile behind that slight entrenchment stood  'Till driv'n from thence she left the stage for good  In our more pious and far chaster times  These sure no longer are the Muse's crimes  But some complain that former faults to shun  The reformation to extremes has run  The frantick hero's wild delirium past  Now insipidity succeeds bombast  So slow Melpomene's cold numbers creep  Here dullness seems her drowsy court to keep  And we are scarce awake whilst you are fast asleep  Thalia once so ill behav'd and rude  Reform'd is now become an arrant prude  Retailing nightly to the yawning pit  The purest morals undefil'd by wit  Our Author offers in these motley scenes  A slight remonstrance to the Drama's queens  Nor let the goddesses be over nice  Free spoken subjects give the best advice  Although not quite a novice in his trade  His cause to night requires no common aid  To this a friendly just and pow'rful court  I come Ambassador to beg support  Can he undaunted brave the critick's rage  In civil broils with brother bards engage  Hold forth their errors to the publick eye  Nay more e'en Newspapers themselves defy  Say must his single arm encounter all  By numbers vanquish'd e'en the brave may fall  And though no leader should success distrust  Whose troops are willing and whose cause is just  To bid such hosts of angry foes defiance  His chief dependance must be YOUR ALLIANCE  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Dangle Mr DODD  Sneer Mr PALMER  Sir Fretful Plagiary Mr PARSONS  Signor Pasticcio Ritornello Mr DELPINI  Interpreter Mr BADDELEY  Under Prompter

ARMY  Pshaw  To the first Ldash D of the Adash Y    Genuine Extract of a Letter from ST KITT's    COXHEATH INTELLIGENCE    It is now confidently asserted that SIR CHARLES HARDY  PshawNothing but about the fleet and the nationand I hate all politics but theatrical politicsWhere's the MORNING CHRONICLE  Mrs DANGLE  Yes that's your gazette  DANGLE  So here we have it  "  Theatrical intelligence extraordinary  "  We hear there is a new tragedy in rehearsal at DruryLane Theatre call'd the SPANISH ARMADA said to be written by Mr PUFF a gentleman well known in the theatrical world if we may allow ourselves to give credit to the report of the performers who truth to say are in general but indifferent judges this piece abounds with the most striking and received beauties of modern composition  So I am very glad my friend PUFF's tragedy is in such forwardnessMrs Dangle my dear you will be very glad to hear that PUFF's tragedy  Mrs DANGLE  Lord Mr Dangle why will you plague me about such nonsenseNow the plays are begun I shall have no peaceIsn't it sufficient to make yourself ridiculous by your passion for the theatre without continually teazing me to join you Why can't you ride your hobbyhorse without desiring to place me on a pillion behind you Mr Dangle  DANGLE  Nay my dear I was only going to read  Mrs DANGLE  No no you never will read any thing that's worth listening toyou hate to hear about your country there are letters every day with Roman signatures demonstrating the certainty of an invasion and proving that the nation is utterly undoneBut you never will read any thing to entertain one  DANGLE  What has a woman to do with politics Mrs Dangle  Mrs DANGLE  And what have you to do with the theatre Mr Dangle Why should you affect the character of a Critic I have no patience with you haven't you made yourself the jest of all your acquaintance by your interference in matters where you have no business Are not you call'd a theatrical Quidnunc and a mock Maecenas to secondhand authors  DANGLE  True my power with the Managers is pretty notorious but is it no credit to have applications from all quarters for my interestFrom lords to recommend fidlers from ladies to get  boxes from authors to get answers and from actors to get engagements  Mrs DANGLE  Yes truly you have contrived to get a share in all the plague and trouble of theatrical property without the profit or even the credit of the abuse that attends it  DANGLE  I am sure Mrs Dangle you are no loser by it however you have all the advantages of it mightn't you last winter have had the reading of the new Pantomime a fortnight previous to its performance And doesn't Mr Fosbrook let you take places for a play before it is advertis'd and set you down for a Box for every new piece through the season And didn't my friend Mr Smatter dedicate his last Farce to you at my particular request Mrs Dangle  Mrs DANGLE  Yes but wasn't the Farce damn'd Mr Dangle And to be sure it is extremely pleasant to have one's house made the motley rendezvous of all the lackeys of literatureThe very high change of trading authors and jobbing criticsYes my drawingroom is an absolute registeroffice for candidate actors and poets without characterthen to be continually alarmed with Misses and Ma'ams piping histeric changes on  JULIETS and DORINDAS POLLYS and OPHELIAS and the very furniture trembling at the probationary starts and unprovok'd rants of wouldbe RICHARDS and HAMLETSAnd what is worse than all now that the Manager has monopoliz'd the OperaHouse haven't we the Signors and Signioras calling here sliding their smooth semibreves and gargling glib divisions in their outlandish throatswith foreign emissaries and French spies for ought I know disguised like fidlers and figure dancers  DANGLE  Mercy Mrs Dangle  Mrs DANGLE  And to employ yourself so idly at such an alarming crisis as this toowhen if you had the least spirit you would have been at the head of one of the Westminster associationsor trailing a volunteer pike in the Artillery GroundBut youo'my conscience I believe if the French were landed tomorrow your first enquiry would be whether they had brought a theatrical troop with them  DANGLE  Mrs Dangle it does not signifyI say the stage is "the Mirror of Nature" and the actors are "the Abstract and brief Chronicles of the Time"and pray what can a man of sense  study betterBesides you will not easily persuade me that there is no credit or importance in being at the head of a band of critics who take upon them to decide for the whole town whose opinion and patronage all writers solicit and whose recommendation no manager dares refuse  Mrs DANGLE  RidiculousBoth managers and authors of the least merit laugh at your pretensionsThe PUBLIC is their CRITICwithout whose fair approbation they know no play can rest on the stage and with whose applause they welcome such attacks as yours and laugh at the malice of them where they can't at the wit  DANGLE  Very well Madamvery well  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Sneer Sir to wait on you  DANGLE  O shew Mr Sneer up    Exit  Servant  Plague on't now we must appear loving and affectionate or Sneer will hitch us into a story  Mrs DANGLE  With all my heart you can't be more ridiculous than you are  DANGLE  Your are enough to provoke  Enter  Mr SNEER  Hah my dear Sneer I am vastly glad to see you My dear here's Mr Sneer  Mrs DANGLE  Good morning to you Sir  DANGLE  Mrs Dangle and I have been diverting ourselves with the papersPray Sneer won't you go to Drurylane theatre the first night of Puff's tragedy  SNEER  Yes but I suppose one shan't be able to get in for on the first night of a new piece they always fill the house with orders to support it But here Dangle I have brought you two pieces one of which you must exert yourself to make the Managers accept I can tell you that for 'tis written by a person of consequence  DANGLE  So now my plagues are beginning  SNEER  Aye I am glad of it for now you'll be happy Why my dear Dangle it is a pleasure  to see how you enjoy your volunteer fatigue and your solicited solicitations  DANGLE  It's a great troubleyet egad its pleasant tooWhy sometimes of a morning I have a dozen people call on me at breakfast time whose faces I never saw before nor ever desire to see again  SNEER  That must be very pleasant indeed  DANGLE  And not a week but I receive fifty letters and not a line in them about any business of my own  SNEER  An amusing correspondence  DANGLE reading  "Bursts into tears and exit" What is this a tragedy  SNEER  No that's a genteel comedy not a translationonly  taken from the French  it is written in a stile which they have lately tried to run down the true sentimental and nothing ridiculous in it from the beginning to the end  Mrs DANGLE  Well if they had kept to that I should not have been such an enemy to the stage there was some edification to be got from those pieces Mr Sneer  SNEER  I am quite of your opinion Mrs Dangle the theatre in proper hands might certainly be made the school of morality but now I am sorry to say it people seem to go there principally for their entertainment  Mrs DANGLE  It would have been more to the credit of the Managers to have kept it in the other line  SNEER  Undoubtedly Madam and hereafter perhaps to have had it recorded that in the midst of a luxurious and dissipated age they preserv'd  two  houses in the capital where the conversation was always moral at least if not entertaining  DANGLE  Now egad I think the worst alteration is in the nicety of the audienceNo double entendre no smart inuendo admitted even Vanburgh and Congreve oblig'd to undergo a bungling reformation  SNEER  Yes and our prudery in this respect is just on a par with the artificial bashfulness of a courtezan who encreases the blush upon her cheek in an exact proportion to the diminution of her modesty  DANGLE  Sneer can't even give the Public a good wordBut what have we hereThis seems a very odd  SNEER  O that's a comedy on a very new plan replete with wit and mirth yet of a most serious moral You see it is call'd "THE REFORMED HOUSEBREAKER" where by the mere force of humour HOUSEBREAKING is put into so ridiculous a light that if the piece has its proper run I have no doubt but that bolts and bars will be entirely useless by the end of the season  DANGLE  Egad this is new indeed  SNEER  Yes it is written by a particular friend of mine who has discovered that the follies and foibles of society are subjects unworthy the notice of the Comic Muse who should be taught to stoop only at the greater vices and blacker crimes of humanitygibbeting capital offences in five acts and pillorying petty larcenies in twoIn short  his idea is to dramatize the penal laws and make the Stage a court of ease to the Old Bailey  DANGLE  It is truly moral  Enter SERVANT  Sir Fretful Plagiary Sir  DANGLE  Beg him to walk up    Exit  Servant  Now Mrs Dangle Sir Fretful Plagiary is an author to your own taste  Mrs DANGLE  I confess he is a favourite of mine because every body else abuses him  SNEER  Very much to the credit of your charity Madam if not of your judgment  DANGLE  But egad he allows no merit to any author but himself that's the truth on'ttho' he's my friend  SNEER  NeverHe is as envious as an old maid verging on the desperation of sixandthirty and then the insiduous humility with which he seduces you to give a free opinion on any of his  works can be exceeded only by the petulant arrogance with which he is sure to reject your observations  DANGLE  Very true egadtho' he's my friend  SNEER  Then his affected contempt of all newspaper strictures tho' at the same time he is the sorest man alive and shrinks like scorch'd parchment from the fiery ordeal of true criticism yet is he so covetous of popularity that he had rather be abused than not mentioned at all  DANGLE  There's no denying ittho' he is my friend  SNEER  You have read the tragedy he has just finished haven't you  DANGLE  O yes he sent it to me yesterday  SNEER  Well and you think it execrable don't you  DANGLE  Why between ourselves egad I must owntho' he's my friendthat it is one of the most  He's here  Aside  finished and most admirable perform  Sir Fretful  without    Mr Sneer with him did you say  Enter  Sir FRETFUL  Ah my dear friendEgad we were just speaking of your TragedyAdmirable Sir Fretful admirable  SNEER  You never did any thing beyond it Sir Fretful never in your life  Sir FRETFUL  You make me extremely happyfor without a compliment my dear Sneer there isn't a man in the world whose judgment I value as I do yoursAnd Mr Dangle's  Mrs DANGLE  They are only laughing at you Sir Fretful for it was but just now that  DANGLE  Mrs DangleAh Sir Fretful you know Mrs DangleMy friend Sneer was rallying just nowHe knows how she admires you and  Sir FRETFUL  O LordI am sure Mr Sneer has more taste and sincerity than toA damn'd doublefaced fellow  DANGLE  Yes yesSneer will jestbut a better humour'd  Sir FRETFUL  O I know  DANGLE  He has a ready turn for ridiculehis wit costs him nothing  Sir FRETFUL  No egador I should wonder how he came by it  Aside  Mrs DANGLE  Because his jest is always at the expence of his friend  DANGLE  But Sir Fretful have you sent your play to the managers yetor can I be of any service to you  Sir FRETFUL  No No I thank you I believe the piece had sufficient recommendation with itI thank you tho'I sent it to the manager of COVENTGARDEN THEATRE this morning  SNEER  I should have thought now that it might have been cast as the actors call it better at DRURYLANE  Sir FRETFUL  O lud nonever send a play there while I liveharkee    Whispers  Sneer  SNEER  Writes himself  I know he does  Sir FRETFUL  I say nothingI take away from no man's meritam hurt at no man's good fortuneI say nothingBut this I will saythrough all my knowledge of life I have observ'dthat there is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human heart as envy  SNEER  I believe you have reason for what you say indeed  Sir FRETFUL  BesidesI can tell you it is not always so safe to leave a play in the hands of those who write themselves  SNEER  What they may steal from them hey my dear Plagiary  Sir FRETFUL  Stealto besure they may and egad serve your best thoughts as gypsies do stolen children disfigure them to make 'em pass for their own  SNEER  But your present work is a sacrifice to Melpomene and HE you know never  Sir FRETFUL  That's no securityA dext'rous plagiarist may do any thingWhy Sir for ought I know he might take out some of the best things in my tragedy and put them into his own comedy  SNEER  That might be done I dare be sworn  Sir FRETFUL  And then if such a person gives you the least hint or assistance he is devilish apt to take the merit of the whole  DANGLE  If it succeeds  Sir FRETFUL  Ayebut with regard to this piece I think I can hit that gentleman for I can safely swear he never read it  SNEER  I'll tell you how you may hurt him more  Sir FRETFUL  How  SNEER  Swear he wrote it  Sir FRETFUL  Plague on't now Sneer I shall take it illI believe you want to take away my character as an author  SNEER  Then I am sure you ought to be very much oblig'd to me  Sir FRETFUL  HeySir  DANGLE  O you know he never means what he says  Sir FRTEFUL  Sincerely thenyou do like the piece  SNEER  Wonderfully  Sir FRETFUL  But come now there must be something that you think might be mended heyMr Dangle has nothing struck you  DANGLE  Why faith it is but an ungracious thing for the most part to  Sir FRETFUL  With most authors it is just so indeed they are in general strangely tenaciousBut for  my part I am never so well pleased as when a judicious critic points out any defect to me for what is the purpose of shewing a work to a friend if you don't mean to profit by his opinion  SNEER  Very trueWhy then tho' I seriously admire the piece upon the whole yet there is one small objection which if you'll give me leave I'll mention  Sir FRETFUL  SIR you can't oblige me more  SNEER  I think it wants incident  Sir FRETFUL  Good Godyou surprize mewants incident  SNEER  Yes I own I think the incidents are too few  Sir FRETFUL  Good GodBelieve me Mr Sneer there is no person for whose judgment I have a more implicit deferenceBut I protest to you Mr Sneer I am only apprehensive that the incidents are too crowdedMy dear Dangle how does it strike you  DANGLE  Really I can't agree with my friend SneerI  think the plot quite sufficient and the four first acts by many degrees the best I ever read or saw in my life If I might venture to suggest any thing it is that the interest rather falls off in the fifth  Sir FRETFUL  Rises I believe you mean Sir  DANGLE  No I don't upon my word  Sir FRETFUL  Yes yes you do upon my soulit certainly don't fall off I assure youNo no it don't fall off  DANGLE  Now Mrs Dangle didn't you say it struck you in the same light  Mrs DANGLE  No indeed I did notI did not see a fault in any part of the play from the beginning to the end  Sir FRETFUL  Upon my soul the women are the best judges after all  Mrs DANGLE  Or if I made any objection I am sure it was to nothing in the piece but that I was afraid it was on the whole a little too long  Sir FRETFUL  Pray Madam do you speak as to duration of  time or do you mean that the story is tediously spun out  Mrs DANGLE  O Lud noI speak only with reference to the usual length of acting plays  Sir FRETFUL  Then I am very happyvery happy indeedbecause the play is a short play a remarkably short playI should not venture to differ with a lady on a point of taste but on these occasions the watch you know is the critic  Mrs DANGLE  Then I suppose it must have been Mr Dangle's drawling manner of reading it to me  Sir FRETFUL  O if Mr Dangle read it that's quite another affairBut I assure you Mrs Dangle the first evening you can spare me three hours and an half I'll undertake to read you the whole from beginning to end with the Prologue and Epilogue and allow time for the music between the acts  Mrs DANGLE  I hope to see it on the stage next  DANGLE  Well Sir Fretful I wish you may be able to  get rid as easily of the newspaper criticisms as you do of ours  Sir FRETFUL  The NEWSPAPERSSir they are the most villainouslicentiousabominableinfernalNot that I ever read themNoI make it a rule never to look into a newspaper  DANGLE  You are quite rightfor it certainly must hurt an author of delicate feelings to see the liberties they take  Sir FRETFUL  Noquite the contrarytheir abuse is in fact the best panegyricI like it of all thingsAn author's reputation is only in danger from their support  Mr SNEER  Why that's trueand that attack now on you the other day  Sir FRETFUL  What where  DANGLE  Aye you mean in a paper of Thursday it was compleatly illnatur'd to be sure  Sir FRETFUL  O so much the betterHa ha haI wou'dn't have it otherwise  DANGLE  Certainly it is only to be laugh'd at for  Sir FRETFUL  You don't happen to recollect what the fellow said do you  SNEER  Pray DangleSir Fretful seems a little anxious  Sir FRETFUL  O lud noanxiousnot Inot the least IBut one may as well hear you know  DANGLE  Sneer do  you  recollectMake out something  Aside  SNEER  I will    to Dangle    Yes yes I remember perfectly  Sir FRETFUL  Well and pray nowNot that it signifieswhat might the gentleman say  SNEER  Why he roundly asserts that you have not the slightest invention or original genius whatever tho' you are the greatest traducer of all other authors living  Sir FRETFUL  Ha ha havery good  SNEER  That as to COMEDY you have not one idea of your own he believes even in your common placebookwhere stray jokes and pilfered witticisms are kept with as much method as the ledger of the LOSTandSTOLENOFFICE  Sir FRETFUL  Ha ha havery pleasant  SNEER  Nay that you are so unlucky as not to have the skill even to  steal  with tasteBut that you gleen from the refuse of obscure volumes where more judicious plagiarists have been before you so that the body of your work is a composition of dregs and sedimentslike a bad tavern's worst wine  Sir FRETFUL  Ha ha  SNEER  In your more serious efforts he says your bombast would be less intolerable if the thoughts were ever suited to the expression but the homeliness of the sentiment stares thro' the fantastic encumbrance of it's fine language like a clown in one of the new uniforms  Sir FRETFUL  Ha ha  SNEER  That your occasional tropes and flowers suit the general coarseness of your stile as tambour sprigs would a ground of linseywolfey while your imitations of Shakespeare resemble the mimicry of Falstaff's Page and are about as near the standard of the original  Sir FRETFUL  Ha  SNEER  In short that even the finest passages you steal are of no service to you for the poverty of your own language prevents their assimilating so that they lie on the surface like lumps of marl on a barren moor encumbering what it is not in their power to fertilize  Sir FRETFUL  after great agitation  Now another person would be vex'd at this  SNEER  Oh but I wou'dn't have told you only to divert you  Sir FRETFUL  I know itI  am  divertedHa ha hanot the least inventionHa ha ha very goodvery good  SNEER  Yesno genius Ha ha ha  DANGLE  A severe rogue Ha ha ha But you are quite right Sir Fretful never to read such nonsense  Sir FRETFUL  To be surefor if there is any thing to one's praise it is a foolish vanity to be gratified at it and if it is abusewhy one is always sure to hear of it from one damn'd good natur'd friend or another  Enter SERVANT  Sir there is an Italian gentleman with a French Interpreter and three young ladies and a dozen musicians who say they are sent by LADY RONDEAU and MRS FUGE  DANGLE  Gadso they come by appointment Dear Mrs Dangle do let them know I'll see them directly  Mrs DANGLE  You know Mr Dangle I shan't understand a word they say  DANGLE  But you hear there's an interpreter  Mrs DANGLE  Well I'll try to endure their complaisance till you come  Exit  SERVANT  And Mr PUFF Sir has sent word that the last rehearsal is to be this morning and that he'll call on you presently  DANGLE  That's trueI shall certainly be at home    Exit  Servant  Now Sir Fretful if you have a mind to have justice done you in the way of answerEgad Mr PUFF's your man  Sir FRETFUL  Pshaw Sir why should I wish to have it answered when I tell you I am pleased at it  DANGLE  True I had forgot thatBut I hope you are not fretted at what Mr Sneer  Sir FRETFUL  Zounds no Mr Dangle don't I tell you these things never fret me in the least  DANGLE  Nay I only thought  Sir FRETFUL  And let me tell you Mr Dangle 'tis  damn'd affronting in you to suppose that I am hurt when I tell you I am not  SNEER  But why so warm Sir Fretful  Sir FRETFUL  Gadslife Mr Sneer you are as absurd as Dangle how often must I repeat it to you that nothing can vex me but your supposing it possible for me to mind the damn'd nonsense you have been repeating to meand let me tell you if you continue to believe this you must mean to insult me gentlemenand then your disrespect will affect me no more than the newspaper criticismsand I shall treat itwith exactly the same calm indifference and philosophic contemptand so your servant  Exit  SNEER  Ha ha ha Poor Sir Fretful Now will he go and vent his philosophy in anonymous abuse of all modern critics and authorsBut Dangle you must get you friend PUFF to take me to the rehearsal of his tragedy  DANGLE  I'll answer for't he'll thank you for desiring it But come and help me to judge of this musical family they are recommended by people of consequence I assure you  SNEER  I am at your disposal the whole morningbut I thought you had been a decided critic in musick as well as in literature  DANGLE  So I ambut I have a bad earEfaith Sneer tho' I am afraid we were a little too severe on Sir Fretfultho' he is my friend  SNEER  Why 'tis certain that unnecessarily to mortify the vanity of any writer is a cruelty which mere dulness never can deserve but where a base and personal malignity usurps the place of literary emulation the aggressor deserves neither quarter nor pity  DANGLE  That's ture egadtho' he's my friend  SCENE II  A Drawing Room Harpsichord c Italian Family French Interpreter Mrs Dangle and Servants discovered

whom I have long panted for the honour of knowinga gentleman whose critical talents and transcendant judgment  SNEER  Dear Sir  DANGLE  Nay don't be modest Sneer my friend PUFF only talks to you in the stile of his profession  SNEER  His profession  PUFF  Yes Sir I make no secret of the trade I followamong friends and brother authors Dangle knows I love to be frank on the subject and to advertise myself  vivâ voce  I am Sir a Practitioner in Panegyric or to speak more plainlya Professor of the Art of Puffing at your serviceor any body else's  SNEER  Sir you are very obligingI believe Mr Puff I have often admired your talents in the daily prints  PUFF  Yes Sir I flatter myself I do as much business in that way as any six of the fraternity in townDevilish hard work all the summerFriend Dangle never work'd harderBut harkeethe Winter Managers were a little sore I believe  DANGLE  NoI believe they took it all in good part  PUFF  AyeThen that must have been affectation in them for egad there were some of the attacks which there was no laughing at  SNEER  Aye the humourous onesBut I should think Mr Puff that Authors would in general be able to do this sort of work for themselves  PUFF  Why yesbut in a clumsy wayBesides we look on that as an encroachment and so take the opposite sideI dare say now you conceive half the very civil paragraphs and advertisements you see to be written by the parties concerned or their friendsNo such thingNine out of ten manufactured by me in the way of business  SNEER  Indeed  PUFF  Even the Auctioneers nowthe Auctioneers I say tho' the rogues have lately got some credit for their languagenot an article of the merit their'stake them out of their Pulpits and they are as dull as CataloguesNo Sir'twas I first enrich'd their style'twas I first taught them to crowd their advertisements with panegyrical superlatives each epithet rising above the otherlike the Bidders in their own Auctionrooms From ME they learn'd to enlay their phraseology with variegated chips of exotic metaphor by ME too their inventive faculties  were called forthYes Sir by ME they were instructed to clothe ideal walls with gratuitous fruitsto insinuate obsequious rivulets into visionary grovesto teach courteous shrubs to nod their approbation of the grateful soil or on emergencies to raise upstart oaks where there never had been an acorn to create a delightful vicinage without the assistance of a neighbour or fix the temple of Hygeia in the fens of Lincolnshire  DANGLE  I am sure you have done them infinite service for now when a gentleman is ruined he parts with his house with some credit  SNEER  Service if they had any gratitude they would erect a statue to him they would figure him as a presiding Mercury the god of traffic and fiction with a hammer in his hand instead of a caduceusBut pray Mr Puff what first put you on exercising your talents in this way  PUFF  Egad sirsheer necessitythe proper parent of an art so nearly allied to invention you must know Mr Sneer that from the first time I tried my hand at an advertisement my success was such that for sometime after I led a most extraordinary life indeed  SNEER  How pray  PUFF  Sir I supported myself two years entirely by my misfortunes  SNEER  By your misfortunes  PUFF  Yes Sir assisted by long sickness and other occasional disorders and a very comfortable living I had of it  SNEER  From sickness and misfortunesYou practised as a Doctor and an Attorney at once  PUFF  No egad both maladies and miseries were my own  SNEER  Heywhat the plague  DANGLE  'Tis true efaith  PUFF  HarkeeBy advertisements"To the charitable and humane" and "to those whom Providence hath blessed with affluence"  SNEER  OhI understand you  PUFF  And in truth I deserved what I got for I suppose never man went thro' such a series of calamities in the same space of timeSir I was five times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state of affluence by a train of unavoidable misfortunes then Sir tho' a very industrious tradesman I was twice burnt out and lost my little all both timesI lived upon those fires a monthI soon after was confined by a most excruciating disorder and lost the use of my limbsThat told very well for I had the case strongly attested and went about to collect the subscriptions myself  DANGLE  Egad I believe that was when you first called on me  PUFF  In November lastO noI was at that time a close prisoner in the Marshalsea for a debt benevolently contracted to serve a friendI was afterwards twice tapped for a dropsy which declined into a very profitable consumptionI was then reduced toO nothen I became a widow with six helpless childrenafter having had eleven husbands pressed and being left every time eight months  gone with child and without money to get me into an hospital  SNEER  And you bore all with patience I make no doubt  PUFF  Why yestho' I made some occasional attempts at felo de se but as I did not find those  rash actions  answer I left off killing myself very soonWell Sirat last what with bankruptcies fires gouts dropsies imprisonments and other valuable calamities having got together a pretty handsome sum I determined to quit a business which had always gone rather against my conscience and in a more liberal way still to indulge my talents for fiction and embellishment thro' my favourite channels of diurnal communicationand so Sir you have my history  SNEER  Most obligingly communicative indeed and your confession if published might certainly serve the cause of true charity by rescuing the most useful channels of appeal to benevolence from the cant of impositionBut surely Mr PUFF there is no great  mystery  in your present profession  PUFF  Mystery Sir I will take upon me to say the matter was never scientifically treated nor reduced to rule before  SNEER  Reduced to rule  PUFF  O lud Sir you are very ignorant I am afraidYes SirPUFFING is of various sortsthe principal are The PUFF DIRECTthe PUFF PRELIMINARYthe PUFF COLLATERALthe PUFF COLLUSIVE and the PUFF OBLIQUE or PUFF by IMPLICATIONThese all assume as circumstances require the various forms of LETTER TO THE EDITOROCCASIONAL ANECDOTEIMPARTIAL CRITIQUEOBSERVATION from CORRESPONDENTor ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE PARTY  SNEER  The puff direct I can conceive  PUFF  O yes that's simple enoughfor instanceA new Comedy or Farce is to be produced at one of the Theatres though by the bye they don't bring out half what they ought to do The author suppose Mr Smatter or Mr Dapperor any particular friend of minevery well  the day before it is to be performed I write an account of the manner in which it was receivedI have the plot from the authorand only addCharacters strongly drawnhighly colouredhand of a masterfund of genuine humourmine of inventionneat dialogueattic salt Then for the performanceMr DODD was astonishingly great in the character of SIR HARRY That universal and judicious actor Mr PALMER perhaps never appeared to more advantage than in the COLONELbut it is not in the power of language to do justice to Mr KINGIndeed he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most brilliant and judicious audience As to the sceneryThe miraculous power of Mr DE LOUTHER BOURG's pencil are universally acknowledgedIn short we are at a loss which to admire mostthe unrivalled genius of the author the great attention and liberality of the managersthe wonderful abilities of the painter or the incredible exertions of all the performers  SNEER  That's pretty well indeed Sir  PUFF  O coolquite coolto what I sometimes do  SNEER  And do you think there are any who are influenced by this  PUFF  O lud yes Sirthe number of those who go thro' the fatigue of judging for themselves is very small indeed  SNEER  Well Sirthe PUFF PRELIMINARY  PUFF  O that Sir does well in the form of a  Caution  In a matter of gallantry nowSir FLIMSY GOSSIMER wishes to be well with LADY FANNY FETEHe applies to meI open trenches for him with a paragraph in the Morning PostIt is recommended to the beautiful and accomplished Lady F four stars F dash E to be on her guard against that dangerous character Sir F dash G who however pleasing and insinuating his manners may be is certainly not remarkable for the  constancy of his attachments  in ItalicsHere you see Sir FLIMSY GOSSIMER is introduced to the particular notice of Lady FANNYwho perhaps never thought of him beforeshe finds herself publickly cautioned to avoid him which naturally makes her desirous of seeing himthe observation of their acquaintance causes a  pretty kind of mutual embarrassment this produces a sort of sympathy of interestwhich if Sir Flimsy is unable to improve effectually he at least gains the credit of having their names mentioned together by a particular set and in a particular waywhich nine times out of ten is the full accomplishment of modern gallantry  DANGLE  Egad Sneer you will be quite an adept in the business  PUFF  Now Sir the PUFF COLLATERAL is much used as an appendage to advertisements and may take the form of anecdoteYesterday as the celebrated GEORGE BONMOT was sauntering down St James'sstreet he met the lively Lady MARY MYRTLE coming out of the Park'Good God LADY MARY I'm surprised to meet you in a white jacketfor I expected never to have seen you but in a fulltrimmed unifor and a lighthorseman's cap'"Heavens GEORGE where could you have learned that"'Why replied the wit I just saw a print of you in a new publication called The CAMP MAGAZINE which by the bye is a devilish clever thingand is sold at No on the right hand of the way two doors from the  printingoffice the corner of Ivylane Paternosterrow price only one shilling'  SNEER  Very ingenious indeed  PUFF  But the PUFF COLLUSIVE is the newest of any for it acts in the disguise of determined hostilityIt is much used by bold booksellers and enterprising poetsAn indignant correspondent observesthat the new poem called BEELZEBUB's COTILLION or PROSERPINE's FETE CHAMPETRE is one of the most unjustifiable performances he ever read The severity with which certain characters are handled is quite shocking And as there are many descriptions in it too warmly coloured for female delicacy the shameful avidity with which this piece is bought by all people of fashion is a reproach on the taste of the times and a disgrace to the delicacy of the ageHere you see the two strongest inducements are held forthFirst that nobody ought to read itand secondly that every body buys it on the strength of which the publisher boldly prints the tenth edition before the had sold ten of the first and then establishes it by threatening himself with the pillory or absolutely indicting himseif for SCAN MAG  DANGLE  Ha ha ha'gad I know it is so▪  PUFF  As to the PUFF OBLIQUE or PUFF BY IMPLICATION it is too various and extensive to be illustrated by an instanceit attracts in titles and presumes in patents it lurks in the  limitation  of a subscription and invites in the assurance of croud and incommodation at public places it delights to draw forth concealed merit with a most disinterested assiduity and sometimes wears a countenance of smiling censure and tender reproachIt has a wonderful memory for Parliamentary Debates and will often give the whole speech of a favoured member with the most flattering accuracy But above all it is a great dealer in reports and suppositionsIt has the earliest intelligence of intended preferments that will reflect  honor  on the  patrons  and embryo promotions of modest gentlemenwho know nothing of the matter themselves It can hint a ribband for implied services in the air of a common report and with the carelesness of a casual paragraph suggest officers into commandsto which they have no pretension but their wishes This Sir is the last principal class in the ART of PUFFINGAn art which I hope you will  now agree with me is of the highest dignityyielding a tablature of benevolence and public spirit befriending equally trade gallantry criticism and politicsthe applause of genius the register of charity the triumph of heroism the self defence of contractors the fame of oratorsand the gazette of ministers  SNEER  Sir I am compleatly a convert both to the importance and ingenuity of your profession and now Sir there is but one thing which can possibly encrease my respect for you and that is your permitting me to be present this morning at the rehearsal of your new trage  PUFF  Hush for heaven's sake  My  tragedyEgad Dangle I take this very illyou know how apprehensive I am of being known to be the author  DANGLE  'Efaith I would not have toldbut it's in the papers and your name at lengthin the Morning Chronicle  PUFF  Ah those damn'd editors never can keep a secretWell Mr Sneerno doubt you will do me great honourI shall be infinitely happyhighly flattered  DANGLE  I believe it must be near the timeshall we go together  FUFF  No It will not be yet this hour for they are always late at that theatre besides I must meet you there for I have some little matters here to send to the papers and a few paragraphs to scribble before I go    Looking at memorandums  Here is 'a CONSCIENTIOUS BAKER on the Subject of the Army Bread' and 'a DETESTER OF VISIBLE BRICKWORK in favor of the new invented Stucco' both in the style of JUNIUS and promised for tomorrowThe Thames navigation too is at a standMISOMUD or ANTISHOAL must go to work again directly Here too are some political memorandums I see ayeTo take PAUL JONES and get the INDIAMEN out of the SHANNONreinforce BYRONcompel the DUTCH tosoI must do that in the evening papers or reserve it for the Morning Herald for I know that I have undertaken tomorrow besides to establish the unanimity of the fleet in the Public Advertiser and to shoot CHARLES Fox in the Morning PostSo egad I ha'n't a moment to lose  DANGLE  Wellwe'll meet in the Green Room  Exeunt severally  END OF ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  The THEATRE  Enter  DANGLE PUFF and SNEER  as before the Curtain  PUFF  NO no Sir what Shakespeare says of ACTORS may be better applied to the purpose of PLAYS  they  ought to be 'the abstract and brief Chronicles of the times' Therefore when history and particularly the history of our own country furnishes any thing like a case in point to the time in which an author writes if he knows his own interest he will take advantage of it so Sir I call my tragedy The SPANISH ARMADA and have laid the scene before TILBURY FORT  SNEER  A most happy thought certainly  DANGLE  Egad it wasI told you soBut pray now I dont understand how you have contrived to introduce any love into it  PUFF  LoveOh nothing so easy for it is a received point among poets that where history gives you a good heroic outline for a play you may fill up with a little love at your own discretion in doing which nine times out of ten you only make up a deficiency in the private history of the timesNow I rather think I have done this with some success  SNEER  No scandal about Queen ELIZABETH I hope  PUFF  O Lud no noI only suppose the Governor of Tilbury Fort's daughter to be in love with the son of the Spanish Admiral  SNEER  Oh is that all  DANGLE  Excellent EfaithI see it at onceBut won't this appear rather improbable  PUFF  To be sure it willbut what the plague a play is not to shew occurrences that happen every day but things just so strange that tho' they never  did  they  might  happen  SNEER  Certainly nothing is unnatural that is not physically impossible  PUFF  Very trueand for that matter DON FEROLO WISKERANDOSfor that's the lover's name might have been over here in the train of the Spanish Ambassador or TILBURINA for that is the lady's name might have been in love with him from having heard his character or seen his picture or from knowing that he was the last man in the world she ought to be in love withor for any other good female reasonHowever Sir the fact is that tho' she is but a Knight's daughter egad she is in love like any Princess  DANGLE  Poor young lady I feel for her already for I can conceive how great the conflict must be between her passion and her duty her love for her country and her love for DON FEROLO WISKERANDOS  PUFF  O amazingher poor susceptible heart is swayed to and fro by contending passions like  Enter  UNDER PROMPTER  UNDER PROMPTER  Sir the scene is set and every thing is ready to begin if you please  PUFF  'Egad then we'll lose no time  UNDER PROMPTER  Tho' I believe Sir you will find it very short for all the performers have profited by the kind permission you granted them  PUFF  Hey what  UNDER PROMPTER  You know Sir you gave them leave to cut out or omit whatever they found heavy or unnecessary to the plot and I must own they have taken very liberal advantage of your indulgence  PUFF  Well wellThey are in general very good judges and I know I am luxuriantNow Mr HOPKINS as soon as you please  UNDER PROMPTER  to the Musick  Gentlemen will you play a few bars of something just to  PUFF  Aye that's rightfor as we have the scenes and dresses egad we'll go to't as if it was the first night's performancebut you need not mind stopping between the acts  Exit Under Prompter  Orchestra play Then the Bell rings  Soh stand clear gentlemenNow you know there will be a cry of downdownhats off silenceThen up curtainand let us see what our painters have done for us  SCENE II  The Curtain rises and discovers  TILBURY FORT  Two Centinels asleep  DANGLE  Tilbury Fortvery fine indeed  PUFF  Now what do you think I open with  SNEER  Faith I can't guess  PUFF  A clockHark  clock strikes  I open with a clock striking to beget an aweful attention  in the audienceit also marks the time which is four o'clock in the morning and saves a description of the rising fun and a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere  DANGLE  But pray are the centinels to be asleep  PUFF  Fast as watchmen  SNEER  Isn't that odd tho' at such an alarming crisis  PUFF  To be sure it isbut smaller things must give way to a striking scene at the opening that's a ruleAnd the case is that two great men are coming to this very spot to begin the piece now it is not to be supposed they would open their lips if these fellows were watching them so egad I must either have sent them off their posts or set them asleep  SNEER  O that accounts for itBut tell us who are these coming  PUFF  These are theySIR WALTER RALEIGH and SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTONYou'll know Sir  CHRISTOPHER by his turning out his toesfamous you know for his dancing I like to preserve all the little traits of characterNow attend  Enter  Sir WALTER RALEIGH  and  Sir CHRISTOPHER HATTON  SIR CHRISTOPHER  True gallant Raleigh  DANGLE  What they had been talking before  PUFF  O yes all the way as they came alongI beg pardon gentlemen    to the Actors    but these are particular friends of mine whose remarks may be of great service to usDon't mind interrupting them whenever any thing strikes you  To Sneer and Dangle  SIR CHRISTOPHER  True gallant Raleigh  But O thou champion of thy country's fame  There  is  a question which I yet must ask  A question which I never ask'd before  What mean these mighty armaments  This general muster and this throng of chiefs  SNEER  Pray Mr Puff how came Sir Christopher Hatton never to ask that question before  PUFF  What before the Play began how the plague could he  DANGLE  That's true efaith  PUFF  But you will hear what he thinks of the matter  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Alas my noble friend when I behold  Yon tented plains in martial symmetry  Array'dWhen I count o'er yon glittering lines  Of crested warriors where the proud steeds neigh  And valorbreathing trumpet's shrill appeal  Responsive vibrate on my listning ear  When virgin majesty herself I view  Like her protecting Pallas veil'd in steel  With graceful confidence exhort to arms  When briefly all I hear or see bears stamp  Of martial vigilance and stern defence  I cannot but surmiseForgive my friend  If the conjecture's rashI cannot but  SurmiseThen state some danger apprehends  SNEER  A very cautious conjecture that  PUFF  Yes that's his character not to give an opinion but on secure groundsnow then  SIR WALTER  O most accomplished Christopher  PUFF  He calls him by his christian name to shew that they are on the most familiar terms  SIR WALTER  O most accomplish'd Christopher I find  Thy staunch sagacity still tracks the future  In the fresh print of the o'ertaken past  PUFF  Figurative  SIR WALTER  Thy fears are just  SIR CHRISTOPHER  But where whence when and what  The danger isMethinks I fain would learn  SIR WALTER  You know my friend scarce two revolving suns  And three revolving moons have closed their course  Since haughty PHILIP in despight of peace  With hostile hand hath struck at ENGLAND's trade  SIR CHRISTOPHER  I know it well  SIR WALTER  PHILIP you know is proud IBERIA's king  SIR CHRISTOPHER  He is  SIR WALTER  His subjects in base bigotry  And Catholic oppression heldwhile we  You know the protestant persuasion hold  SIR CHRISTOPHER  We do  SIR WALTER  You know besidehis boasted armament  The fam'd Armadaby the Pope baptized  With purpose to invade these realms  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Is sailed  Our last advices so report  SIR WALTER  While the Iberian Admiral's chief hope  His darling son  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Ferolo Wiskerandos hight  SIR WALTER  The sameby chance a pris'ner hath been ta'en  And in this fort of Tilbury  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Is now  Confin'd'tis true and oft from you tall turrets top  I've mark'd the youthful Spaniard's haughty mien  Unconquer'd tho' in chains  SIR WALTER  You also know  DANGLE  Mr Puff as he  knows  all this why does Sir Walter go on telling him  PUFF  But the audience are not supposed to know any thing of the matter are they  SNEER  True but I think you manage ill for there certainly appears no reason why Sir Walter should be so communicative  PUFF  For egad now that is one of the most ungrateful observations I ever heardfor the less inducement he has to tell all th  s the more I think you ought to be oblig'd to him for I am sure you'd know nothing of the matter without it  DANGLE  That's very true upon my word  PUFF  But you will find he was  not  going on  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Enough enough'tis plainand I no more  Am in amazement lost  PUFF  Here now you see Sir Christopher did not in fact ask any one question for his own information  SNEER  No indeedhis has been a most disinterested curiosity  DANGLE  Really I find we are very much oblig'd to them both  PUFF  To be sure you are Now then for the Commander in Chief the EARL OF LEICESTER who you know was no favourite but of the Queen'sWe left off"in amazement lost"  SIR CHRISTOPHER  Am in amazement lost  But see where noble Leicester comes supreme  In honours and command  SIR WALTER  And yet methinks  At such a time so perilous so fear'd  That staff might well become an abler grasp  SIR CHRISTOPHER  And so by heav'n think I but soft he's here  PUFF  Aye they envy him  SNEER  But who are these with him  PUFF  O very valiant knights one is the Governor of the fort the other the master of the horseAnd now I think you shall hear some better language I was obliged to be plain and intelligible in the first scene because there was so much matter of fact in it but now efaith you have trope figure and metaphor as plenty as nounsubstantives  Enter Earl of  LEICESTER  the Governor and others  LEICESTER  How's this my friends is't thus your new fledg'd zeal  And plumed valor moulds in roostedsloth  Why dimly glimmers that heroic flame  Whose red'ning blaze by patriot spirit fed  Should be the beacon of a kindling realm  Can the quick current of a patriot heart  Thus stagnate in a cold and weedy converse  Or freeze in tideless inactivity  No rather let the fountain of your valor  Spring thro' each stream of enterprize  Each petty channel of conducive daring  Till the full torrent of your foaming wrath  O'erwhelm the flats of sunk hostility  PUFF  There it isfollow'd up  SIR WALTER  No more the fresh'ning breath of thy rebuke  Hath fill'd the swelling canvass of our souls  And thus tho' fate should cut the cable of  All take hands  Our topmost hopes in friendship's closing line  We'll grapple with despair and if we fall  We'll fall in Glory's wake  EARL OF LEICESTER  There spoke Old England's genius  Then are we all resolv'd  ALL  We areall resolv'd  EARL OF LEICESTER  To conqueror be free  ALL  To conquer or be free  EARL OF LEICESTER  All  ALL  All  DANGLE  Nem con  egad  PUFF  O yes where they  do  agree on the stage their unanimity is wonderful  EARL OF LEICESTER  Then let's embraceand now  SNEER  What the plague is he going to pray  PUFF  Yes hushin great emergencies there is nothing like a prayer  EARL OF LEICESTER  O mighty Mars  DANGLE  But why should he pray to  Mars  PUFF  Hush  EARL OF LEICESTER  If in thy homage bred  Each point of discipline I've still observ'd  Nor but by due promotion and the right  Of service to the rank of MajorGeneral  Have ris'n assist thy votary now  GOVERNOR  Yet do not risehear me  MASTER OF HORSE  And me  KNIGHT  And me  SIR WALTER  And me  SIR CHRISTOPHER  And me  PUFF  Now pray all together  ALL  Behold thy votaries submissive beg  That thou will deign to grant them all they ask  Assist them to accomplish all their ends  And sanctify whatever means they use  To gain them  SNEER  A very orthodox quintetto  PUFF  Vastly well gentlemenIs that well managed or not Have you such a prayer as that on the stage  SNEER  Not exactly  Earl of Leicester to Puff  But Sir you hav'nt settled how we are to get off here  PUFF  You could not go off kneeling could you  Sir Walter to Puff  O no Sir impossible  PUFF  It would have a good effect efaith if you could exeunt prayingYes and would vary the established mode of springing off with a glance at the pit  SNEER  O never mind so as you get them off I'll answer for it the audience wont care how  PUFF  Well then repeat the last line standing and go off the old way  ALL  And sanctify whatever means we use to gain them  Exeunt  DANGLE  Bravo a fine exit  SNEER  Well really Mr Puff  PUFF  Stay a moment  The  CENTINELS  get up  st CENTINEL  All this shall to Lord Burleigh's ear  d CENTINEL  'Tis meet it should  Exeunt Centinels  DANGLE  Heywhy I thought those fellows had been asleep  PUFF  Only a pretence there's the art of it they were spies of Lord Burleigh's  SNEER  But isn't it odd they were never taken notice of not even by the commander in chief  PUFF  O lud Sir if people who want to listen or overhear were not always conniv'd at in a Tragedy there would be no carrying on any plot in the world  DANGLE  That's certain  PUFF  But take care my dear Dangle the morning gun is going to fire  Cannon fires  DANGLE  Well that will have a fine effect  PUFF  I think so and helps to realize the scene  Cannon twice  What the plague  three  morning gunsthere never is but oneaye this is always the  away at the Theatregive these fellows a good thing and they never know when to have done with it You have no more cannon to fire  PROMPTER  from within  No Sir  PUFF  Now then for soft musick  SNEER  Pray what's that for  PUFF  It shews that TILBURINA is coming nothing introduces you a heroine like soft musickHere she comes  DANGLE  And her confidant I suppose  PUFF  To be sure here they areinconsolable to the minuet in Ariadne  Soft musick  Enter  TILBURINA  and  CONFIDANT  TILBURINA  Now has the whispering breath of gentle morn  Bad Nature's voice and Nature's beauty rise  While orient Phoebus with unborrow'd hues  Cloaths the wak'd loveliness which all night slept  In heav'nly drapery Darkness is fled  Now flowers unfold their beauties to the sun  And blushing kiss the beam he sends to wake them  The strip'd carnation and the guarded rose  The vulgar wall flow'r and smart gillyflower  The polyanthus meanthe dapper daizy  Sweet William and sweet marjorumand all  The tribe of single and of double pinks  Now too the feather'd warblers tune their notes  Around and charm the listning groveThe lark  The linnet chafinch bullfinch goldfinch greenfinch  But O to me no joy can they afford  Nor rose nor wall flow'r nor smart gillyflower  Nor polyanthus mean nor dapper daizy  Nor William sweet nor marjoramnor lark  Linnet nor all the finches of the grove  PUFF  Your white handkerchief madam  TILBURINA  I thought Sir I wasn't to use that'till 'heart rending woe'  PUFF  O yes madamat 'the finches of the grove' if you please  TILBURINA  Nor lark  Linnet nor all the finches of the grove  Weeps  PUFF  Vastly well madam  DANGLE  Vastly well indeed  TILBURINA  For O too

merryment  DANGLE  That's certain  CONFIDANT  But see where your stern father comes  It is not meet that he should find you thus  PUFF  Hey what the plaguewhat a cut is herewhy what is become of the description of her first meeting with Don Wiskerandos his gallant behaviour in the sea fight and the simile of the canary bird  TILBURINA  Indeed Sir you'll find they will not be miss'd  PUFF  Very wellVery well  TILBURINA  The cue ma'am if you please  CONFIDANT  It is not meet that he should find you thus  TILBURINA  Thou counsel'st right but 'tis no easy task  For barefaced grief to wear a mask of joy  Enter  GOVERNOR  How's thisin tearsO Tilburina shame  Is this a time for maudling tenderness  And Cupid's baby woeshast thou not heard  That haughty Spain's Popeconsecrated fleet  Advances to our shores while England's fate  Like a clipp'd guinca trembles in the scale  TILBURINA  Then is the crisis of  my  fate at hand  I see the fleets approachI see  PUFF  Now pray gentlemen mindThis is one of the most useful figures we tragedy writers have by which a hero or heroine in consideration of their being often obliged to overlook things that  are  on the stage is allow'd to hear and see a number of things that are not  SNEER  Yesa kind of poetical secondsight  PUFF  Yesnow then madam  TILBURINA  I see their decks  Are clear'dI see the signal made  The line is form'da cable's length asunder  I see the frigates station'd in the rear  And now I hear the thunder of the guns  I hear the victors shoutsI also hear  The vanquish'd groanand now 'tis smokeand now  I see the loose sails shiver in the wind  I seeI seewhat soon you'll see  GOVERNOR  Hold daughter peace this love hath turn'd thy brain  The Spanish fleet thou  canst  not seebecause  It is not yet in sight  DANGLE  Egad tho' the governor seems to make no allowance for this poetical figure you talk of  PUFF  No a plain matteroffact manthat's his character  TILBURINA  But will you then refuse his offer  GOVERNOR  I mustI willI canI oughtI do  TILBURINA  Think what a noble price  GOVERNOR  No moreyou urge in vain  TILBURINA  His liberty is all he asks  SNEER  All  who  asks Mr Puff Who is  PUFF  Egad Sir I can't tellHere has been such cutting and slashing I don't know where they have got to myself  TILBURINA  Indeed Sir you will find it will connect very well  And your reward secure  PUFF  Oif they had'nt been so devilish free with their cutting here you would have found that Don Wiskerandos has been tampering for his liberty and has persuaded Tilburina to make this proposal to her fatherand now pray observe the conciseness with which the argument is conducted Egad the  pro con  goes as smart a hits in a fencing match It is indeed a sort of smallsword logic which we have borrowed from the French  TILBURINA  A retreat in Spain  GOVERNOR  Outlawry here  TILBURINA  Your daughter's prayer  GOVERNOR  Your father's oath  TILBURINA  My lover  GOVERNOR  My country  TILBURINA

think a hundred times that she is on the point of coming in  SNEER  Hang it I think its a pity to keep  her  in the green room all the night  PUFF  O no that always has a fine effectit keeps up expectation  DANGLE  But are we not to have a battle  PUFF  Yes yes you will have a battle at last but egad it's not to be by landbut by seaand that is the only quite new thing in the piece  DANGLE

UNDER PLOT  SNEER  What the plague have you another plot  PUFF  O lord yesever while you live have two plots to your tragedyThe grand point in managing them is only to let your under plot have as little connexion with your main plot as possible I flatter myself nothing can be more distinct than mine for as in my chief plot the  characters are all great peopleI have laid my under plot in low lifeand as the former is to end in deep distress I make the other end as happy as a farceNow Mr Hopkins as soon as you please  Enter  UNDER PROMPTER UNDER PROMPTER  Sir the carpenter says it is impossible you can go to the Park scene yet  PUFF  The Park scene NoI mean the description scene here in the wood  UNDER PROMPTER  Sir the performers have cut it out  PUFF  Cut it out  UNDER PROMPTER  Yes Sir  PUFF  What the whole account of Queen Elizabeth  UNDER PROMPTER  Yes Sir  PUFF  And the description of her horse and sidesaddle  UNDER PROMPTER  Yes Sir  PUFF  So so this is very fine indeed

bit to the crupper very well Sir we must go to the Park scene  UNDER PROMPTER  Sir there is the point the carpenters say that unless there is some business put in here before the drop they shan't have time to clear away the fort or sink Gravesend and the river  PUFF  So this is a pretty dilemma trulyGentlemen you must excuse me these fellows will never be ready unless I go and look after them myself  SNEER  O dear Sirthese little things will happen  PUFF  To cut out this scenebut I'll print itegad I'll print it every word  Exeunt  END OF ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  Before the Curtain  Enter

With half the spirit he has broke them all  If 'tis your worship's pleasure bid him enter  CONSTABLE  I fly the herald of your will  Exit Constable  PUFF  Quick Sir  SNEER  But Mr Puff I think not only the Justice but the clown seems to talk in as high a style as the first hero among them  PUFF  Heaven forbid they should not in a free countrySir I am not for making slavish distinctions and giving all the fine language to the upper sort of people  DANGLE  That's very noble in you indeed  Enter  JUSTICE's LADY  PUFF  Now pray mark this scene  LADY  Forgive this interruption good my love  But as I just now past a pris'ner youth  Whom rude hands hither lead strange bodings seiz'd  My fluttering heart and to myself I said  An if our TOM had liv'd he'd surely been  This stripling's height

To find a fatherwhere he least expects  Exeunt  PUFF  What do you think of that  DANGLE  One of the finest discoveryscenes I ever saw Why this underplot would have made a tragedy itself  SNEER  Aye or a comedy either  PUFF  And keeps quite clear you see of the other  Enter  SCENEMEN  taking away the Seats  PUFF  The scene remains does it  SCENEMAN  Yes Sir  PUFF  You are to leave one chair you knowBut it is always awkward in a tragedy to have you  fellows coming in in your playhouse liveries to remove thingsI wish that could be managed betterSo now for my mysterious yeoman  Enter  A BEEFEATER  BEEFEATER  Perdition catch my soul but  I  do love thee  SNEER  Haven't I heard that line before  PUFF  No I fancy notWhere pray  DANGLE  Yes I think there is something like it in Othello  PUFF  Gad now you put me in mind on't I believe there isbut that's of no consequenceall that can be said is that two people happened to hit on the same thoughtAnd Shakespeare made use of it first that's all  SNEER  Very true  PUFF  Now Sir your soliloquybut speak more to the pit if you pleasethe soliloquy always to the pitthat's a rule  BEEFEATER  Tho' hopeless love finds comfort in despair  It never can endure a rival's bliss  But softI am observ'd  Exit Beefeater  DANGLE  That's a very short soliloquy  PUFF  Yesbut it would have been a great deal longer if he had not been observed  SNEER  A most sentimental Beefeater that Mr Puff  PUFF  HearkeI would not have you be too sure that he  is  a Beefeater  SNEER  What a hero in disguise  PUFF  No matterI only give you a hintBut now

thingthat a Minister in his situation  with the whole affairs of the nation on his head should have time to talkbut hush or you'll put him out  SNEER  Put him out how the plague can that be if he's not going to say any thing  PUFF  There's a reasonwhy his part is to  think  and how the plague do you imagine he can  think  if you keep talking  DANGLE  That's very true upon my word  Burleigh comes forward shakes his head and exit  SNEER  He is very perfect indeedNow pray what did he mean by that  PUFF  You don't take it  SNEER  No I don't upon my soul  PUFF  Why by that shake of the head he gave you to understand that even tho' they had more justice in their cause and wisdom in their measuresyet if there was not a greater spirit shown on the part of the peoplethe country would at last fall a sacrifice to the hostile ambition of the Spanish monarchy  SNEER  The devildid he mean all that by shaking his head  PUFF  Every word of itIf he shook his head as I taught him  DANGLE  Ah there
