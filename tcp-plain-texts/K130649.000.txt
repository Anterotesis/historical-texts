GEORGE EWING at the  Angel  and  Bible  and WILLIAM SMITH at the  Hercules  Booksellers in  Damestreet  M DCC XXXIII Price One Shilling  AN ESSAY on  MAN  EPISTLE I Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to the Universe  Of  Man  in the  Abstract  We can judge only with regard to our  own System  being ignorant of the  Relations  of Systems and Things  VERSE  c Man is not therefore to be deem'd  Imperfect  but a Being suited to his Place and Rank in the Creation agreeable to the  General Order  of Things and conformable to  Ends  and  Relations  to Him unknown    c It is partly upon this  Ignorance  of future Events and partly upon the  Hope  of a Future State that all his Happiness in the Present depends    c His  Pride  in aiming at more  Knowledge  and pretending to more  Perfection  the Cause of his Error and Misery    The  Impiety  of putting himself in the Place of  God  and judging of the Fitness or Unfitness Perfection or Imperfection Justice or Injustice of His Dispensations    The  Absurdity  of conceiting himself the  Final Cause  of the Creation or expecting that Perfection in the  Moral  World which is not in the  Natural  to    The  Unreasonableness  of his Complaints against Providence while on the one Hand he demands the Perfections of the  Angels  on the other the bodily Qualifications of the  Brutes  That the Gift of  Reason alone  countervails all the latter and that to possess any of the  Sensitive Faculties  in a higher Degree would render him miserable    That throughout the whole visible World an Universal  Order  and  Gradation  in these is observ'd which causes a  Subordination  of Creature to Creature and of all Creatures to Man The Gradations of  Sense Instinct Thought Reflection Reason  to    How much  farther  this Order and Subordination of living Creatures may extend above and below us    Were any  Part  of this broken not that Part only but the  Whole  connected  Creation  must be destroyed The Extravagance Madness and Pride of such a Desire    c Consequently the absolute Submission due to Providence both as to our  Present  and  Future  State    c  AWAKE my LAELIUS leave all meaner things  To low Ambition and the Pride of Kings  Let us since Life can little more supply  Than just to look about us and to die  Expatiate free o'er all this  Scene of Man    A mighty Maze but not without a Plan  A Wild where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot  Or Garden tempting with forbidden fruit  Together let us beat this ample Field  Try what the open what the covert yield  The latent Tracts the giddy Heights explore  Of all who blindly creep or sightless soar  Eye Nature's Walk shoot Folly as it flies  And catch the Manners living as they rise  Laugh where we  must  be candid where we  can    But vindicate the Ways of  God  to Man  Say first of  God  above or  Man  below  What can we  reason  but from what we  know    Of Man what see we but his Station here  From which to reason or to which refer  Thro' Worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known  'Tis ours to trace him only in our own  He who thro' vast Immensity can pierce  See Worlds on Worlds compose one Universe  Observe how System into System runs  What other Planets and what other Suns  What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry Star  May tell why Heav'n made all things as they are  But of this Frame the Bearings and the Ties  The strong Connections nice Dependencies  Gradations just has thy pervading Soul  Look'd thro' or can a Part contain the Whole  Is the great Chain that draws all to agree  And drawn supports upheld by God or thee  Presumptuous Man the Reason would'st thou find  Why form'd so weak so little and so blind  First if thou can'st the harder reason guess  Why form'd no weaker blinder and no less  Ask of thy Mother Earth why Oaks are made  Taller or stronger than the Weeds they shade  Or ask of yonder argent fields above  Why JOVE's Satellites are less than JOVE  Of Systems possible if 'tis confest  That Wisdom infinite must form the  Best    Where all must  full  or not  coherent  be  And all that rises rise in due degree  Then in the Scale of Life and Sense 'tis plain  There must be  some where  such a Rank as  Man    And all the Question wrangle e'er so long  Is only this if God has  plac'd him wrong    Respecting  Man  whatever wrong we call  May must be right as relative to  All  In human works tho' labour'd on with pain  A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain  In God's one single can  its End  produce  Yet serves to second too some  other Use  So Man who here seems principal alone  Perhaps acts second to some Sphere unknown  Touches some Wheel or verges to some Gole  'Tis but a Part we see and not a Whole  When the proud Steed shall know why Man restrains  His fiery course or drives him o'er the plains  When the dull Ox why now he breaks the clod  Now wears a Garland an Aegyptian God  Then shall Man's Pride and Dulness comprehend  His Action's Passion's Being's Use and End  Why doing suff'ring check'd impell'd and why  This Hour a Slave the next a Deity  Then say not Man's imperfect Heav'n in Fault  Say rather Man's as perfect as he ought  His being measur'd to his State and Place  His time a Moment and a Point his Space  Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate  All but the page prescrib'd their  present state    From Brutes what Men from Men what Spirits know  Or who could suffer Being here below  The Lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day  Had he thy  Reason  woul'd he skip and play  Pleas'd to the last he crops the flow'ry Food  And licks the Hand just rais'd to shed his blood  Oh blindness to the future kindly giv'n  That each may fill the Circle mark'd by Heav'n  Who sees with equal eye as God of All  A Hero perish or a Sparrow fall  Atoms or Systems into ruin hurl'd  And now a Bubble burst and now a World  Hope humbly then with trembling pinions soar  Wait the great Teacher Death and God adore  What bliss above he gives not thee to know  But gives that  Hope  to be thy blessing now  Hope  springs eternal in the human breast  Man never  is  but always  to be  blest  The soul uneasy and confin'd at home  Rests and expatiates in a life to come  Lo the poor INDIAN whose untutor'd Mind  Sees God in clouds or hears him in the Wind  His soul proud Science never taught to stray  Far as the Solar walk or Milky way  Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n  Behind the cloudtopt hill an humbler Heav'n  Some safer world in depth of Woods embrac'd  Some happier island in the watry waste  Where Slaves once more their native land behold  No Fiends torment no Christians thirst for Gold  To  be  content's his natural desire  He asks no Angel's Wing or Seraph's Fire  But thinks admitted to that equal sky  His faithful Dog shall bear him company  Go wiser Thou and in thy scale of sense  Weigh thy  Opinion  against  Providence    Call Imperfection what thou fancy'st such  Say here HE gives too little there too much  Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust  Yet cry if Man's unhappy God's unjust  If Man alone engross not Heav'ns high Care  Alone made perfect here immortal there  Snatch from his hand the Balance and the Rod  Rejudge his Justice Be the GOD of GOD  In reas'ning  Pride  my Friend our error lies  All quit their sphere and rush into the Skies  Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes  Men would be Angels Angels would be Gods  Aspiring to be Gods if Angels fell  Aspiring to be Angels Men rebel  And who but wishes to invert the Laws  Of ORDER sins against th' Eternal Cause  Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine  Earth for whose use  Pride  answers "'Tis for mine  "For me kind Nature wakes her genial Power  "Suckles each herb and swells out ev'ry flow'r  "Annual for me the Grape the Rose renew  "The juice nectareous and the balmy dew  "For me the Mine a thousand treasures brings  "For me health gushes from a thousand Springs  "Seas roll to waft me suns to light me rise  "My Footstool Earth my Canopy the Skies"  But errs not Nature from this gracious end  From burning suns when livid deaths descend  When Earthquakes swallow or when tempests sweep  Towns to one grave a Nation to the deep  "No 'tis reply'd the first Almighty Cause  "Acts not by partial but by  gen'ral Laws    "Th' exceptions few some change since all began  "And what created perfect"Why then  Man    If the  great End  be human Happiness  And Nature deviates how can Man do less  As much that End a constant course requires  Of Show'rs and sunshine as of man's desires  As much eternal springs and cloudless skies  As men for ever temp'rate calm and wise  If Plagues or Earthquakes break not Heav'n's design  Why then a  Borgia  or a  Cataline    From Pride from Pride our very reas'ning springs  Account for moral as for nat'ral things  Why charge we Heav'n in those in these acquit  In both to reason right is to submit  Better for US perhaps it might appear  Were there all Harmony all Virtue here  That never Air or Ocean felt the wind  That never Passion discompos'd the mind  But ALL subsists by Elemental strife  And Passions are the Elements of Life  The gen'ral ORDER since the whole began  Is kept in  Nature  and is kept in  Man  What would this Man now upward will he soar  And little less than Angel would be more  Now looking downward just as griev'd appears  To want the strength of Bulls the Fur of Bears  Made for his use all Creatures if he call  Say what their use had he the pow'rs of all  Nature to these without profusion kind  The proper organs proper pow'rs assign'd  Each seeming want compensated of course  Here with degrees of Swiftness there of Force  All in exact proportion to the State  Nothing to add and nothing to abate  Each Beast each Insect happy in its own  Is Heav'n unkind to Man and Man alone  Shall he alone whom rational we call  Be pleas'd with nothing if not bless'd with all  The bliss of Man could Pride that blessing find  Is not to think or act  beyond  Mankind  No Pow'rs of Body or of Soul to share  But what his Nature and his State can bear  Why has not Man a microscopic sight  For this plain reason Man is not a Mite  Say what th' Advantage of so fine an eye  T' inspect a Mote not comprehend the Sky  Or Touch so tremblingly alive all o'er  To smart and agonize et ev'ry pore  Or quick Effluvia darting thro' the brain  To sink opprest with Aromatic pain  If Nature thunder'd in his opening ears  And stunn'd him with the music of the Spheres  How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still  The whisp'ring Zephyr and the purling Rill  Who finds not Providence allgood and wise  Alike in what it gives and what denies  Far as Creation's ample Range extends  The Scale of sensual mental pow'rs ascends  Mark how it mounts to Man's imperial race  From the green Myriads in the peopled Grass  What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme  The mole's dim curtain and the Lynx's beam  Of smell the headlong Lioness between  And Hound sagacious on the tainted green  Of hearing from the Life that fills the flood  To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood  The Spider's touch how exquisitely fine  Feels at each thread and lives along the line  In the nice Bee what sense so subtly true  From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew  How  Instinct  varies in the grov'ling Swine  Compar'd halfreas'ning Elephant with thine  'Twixt that and  Reason  what a nice Barrier  For ever sep'rate yet for ever near  Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd  What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide  And middle Natures how they long to join  Yet never pass th'insuperable Line  Without this just  Gradation  could they be  Subjected these to those or all to thee  The Pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone  Is not thy Reason all those pow'rs in one  See thro' this Air this Ocean and this Earth  All Matter quick and bursting into birth  Above how high progressive life may go  Around how wide how deep extend below  Vast Chain of Being which from God began  Nature's ethereal human Angel Man  Beast Bird Fish Insect what no Eye can see  No Glass can reach from Infinite to Thee  From Thee to NothingOn superior Pow'rs  Were we to press inferior might on ours  Or in the full Creation leave a Void  Where one step broken the great Scale's destroy'd  From Nature's Chain whatever Link you strike  Tenth or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike  And if each System in Gradation roll  Alike essential to th'amazing Whole  The least confusion but in one not all  That System only but the whole must fall  Let Earth unbalanc'd from her Orbit fly  Planets and Suns rush lawless thro' the Sky  Let ruling Angels from their Spheres be hurl'd  Being on Being wreck'd and World on World  Heav'n's whole Foundations to their Centre nod  And Nature tremble to the Throne of God  All this dread Order breakFor whom For thee  Vile WormO Madness Pride Impiety  What if the Foot ordain'd the dust to tread  Or Hand to toil aspir'd to be the Head  What if the Head the eye or ear repin'd  To serve mere Engines to the ruling Mind  Just as absurd for any Part to claim  To be another in this gen'ral Frame  Just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains  The great directing MIND of ALL ordains  All are but parts of one stupendous Whole  Whose Body  Nature  is and  God  the Soul  That chang'd thro' all and yet in all the same  Great in the Earth as in th' ethereal frame  Warms in the Sun refreshes in the Breeze  Glows in the Stars and blossoms in the Trees  Lives thro' all Life extends thro' all Extent  Spreads undivided operates unspent  Breathes in our soul informs our mortal part  As full as perfect in a hair as heart  As full as perfect in vile Man that mourns  As the rapt Seraphim that sings and burns  To Him no high no low no great no small  He fills he bounds connects and equals all  Cease then nor ORDER  Imperfection  name  Our proper bliss depends on what we blame  Know thy own  Point  This just this kind degree  Of blindness weakness Heav'n bestows on thee  Submitin this or any other Sphere  Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear  Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r  Or in the natal or the mortal hour  All Nature is but Art unknown to thee  All Chance Direction which thou canst not see  All Discord Harmony not understood  All partial Evil universal Good  And spight of Pride in erring Reason's spight  One truth is clear "Whatever Is is RIGHT"  The End of the First  EPISTLE  AN ESSAY on  MAN  EPISTLE II Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to himself as an Individual  The Business of Man not to pry into  God  but to study  Himself  His  Middle Nature  his  Powers  and  Frailties  and the Limits of his  Capacity V  to    His two Principles  SELFLOVE  and  REASON  both necessary  SelfLove  the  stronger  and why    their  End  the same    The  PASSIONS  and their  Use  to    The  PREDOMINANT PASSION  and its  Force  to    its  Necessity  in directing Men to different Purposes    its  Providential Use  in fixing our  PRINCIPLE  and ascertaining our  VIRTUE Virtue  and  Vice  join'd in our  Mixt Nature  the Limits near yet the Things  separate  and  evident  What is the Office of  Reason  c How odious  Vice  in itself and how we deceive ourselves into it    That however the  Ends  of  Providence  and  General Good  are answer'd in our  Passions  and  Imperfections  c How usefully these are distributed to all  Orders of Men  how useful they are to  Society  and to the  Individuals  In every  State  and in every  Age  of Life    to the end  KNOW then Thy self presume not God to scan  The only Science of Mankind is  Man  Plac'd on this Isthmus of a Middle State  A Being darkly wise and rudely great  With too much Knowledge for the Sceptick Side  With too much Weakness for a Stoic's Pride  He hangs between in doubt to act or rest  To deem himself a Part of God or Beast  In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer  Born but to die and reas'ning but to err  Alike in Ignorance his Reason such  Whether he thinks too little or too much  Chaos of Thought and Passion all confus'd  Still by himself abus'd or disabus'd  Created half to rise and half to fall  Great Lord of all things yet a Prey to all  Sole Judge of Truth in endless Error hurl'd  The Glory Jest and Riddle of the World  Go wondrous Creature mount where Science guides  Go measure Earth weigh Air and state the Tides  Instruct the Planets in what Orbs to run  Correct old Time and regulate the Sun  Go soar with  Plato  to th'empyreal Sphere  To the first Good first Perfect and first Fair  Or tread the mazy round his Follow'rs trod  And quitting Sense call  Imitating God    As Eastern Priests in giddy Circles run  And turn their Heads to imitate the  Sun  Go teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule  Then drop into Thyself and be a Fool  Superior Beings when of late they saw  A mortal Man unfold all Nature's Law  Admir'd such Wisdom in an earthly Shape  And show'd a  Newton  as we show an  Ape  Could he who taught each Planet where to roll  Describe or fix one Movement of the Soul  Who mark'd their Points to rise and to descend  Explain his own Beginning or his End  Alas what Wonder Man's superior Part  Uncheck'd may rise and climb from Art to Art  But when his own great Work is but begun  What Reason weaves by Passion is undone  Two Principles in human Nature reign  SelfLove  to urge and  Reason  to restrain  Nor this a good nor that a bad we call  Each works its end to move or govern all  And to their proper Operation still  Ascribe all Good to their improper Ill  SelfLove  the Spring of Motion acts the Soul  Reason  's comparing Balance rules the whole  Man but for that no  Action  could attend  And but for this were active to no  End  Fix'd like a Plant on his peculiar Spot  To draw nutrition propagate and rot  Or Meteorlike flame lawless through the Void  Destroying others by himself destroy'd  Most  Strength  the moving Principle requires  Active its Task it prompts impels inspires  Sedate and quiet the comparing lies  Form'd but to check delib'rate and advise  SelfLove still stronger as its Object's nigh  Reasons at distance and in prospect lye  That sees immediate Good by present Sense  Reason the future and the consequence  Thicker than Arguments Temptations throng  At best more  watchful  this but that more  strong  The Action of the stronger to suspend  Reason still  use  to Reason still  attend    Attention Habit and Experience gains  Each strengthens Reason and SelfLove restrains  Let subtile Schoolmen teach these Friends to fight  More studious to divide than to unite  And Grace and Virtue Sense and Reason split  With all the rash Dexterity of Wit  Wits just like Fools at War about a  Name    Have full as oft  no  Meaning or  the same  SelfLove and Reason to one End aspire  Pain their Aversion Pleasure their Desire  But greedy That its Object would devour  This taste the Honey and not wound the Flower  Pleasure or wrong or rightly understood  Our greatest Evil or our greatest Good  Modes of SelfLove the  Passions  we may call  'Tis real Good or seeming moves them all  But since not every Good we can  divide    And Reason bids us for  our own  provide  Passions tho'  selfish  if their Means be fair  List under  Reason  and deserve her Care  Those that  imparted  court a nobler Aim  Exalt their Kind and take some  Virtue  's Name  In lazy Apathy let Stoics boast  Their Virtue fix'd 'tis fix'd as in a Frost  Contracted all retiring to the Breast  But Strength of Mind is  Exercise  not  Rest    The rising Tempest puts in act the Soul  Parts it may ravish but preserves the whole  On Life's vast Ocean diversely we sail  Reason the Card but Passion is the Gale  Nor GOD alone in the still Calm we find  He mounts the Storm and  walks upon the Wind  Passions like Elements tho' born to fight  Yet mix'd and soften'd in His Work unite  These 'tis enough to  temper  and  employ    But what composes Man can Man  destroy  Suffice that Reason keep to Nature's Road  Subject compound them follow her and God  Love Hope and Joy fair Pleasure's smiling Train  Hate Fear and Grief the Family of Pain  These mix'd with Art and to due Bounds confin'd  Make and maintain the Balance of the Mind  The Lights and Shades whose well accorded Strife  Gives all the  Strength  and  Colour  of our Life  Pleasures are ever in our Hands or Eyes  And when in Act they cease in Prospect rise  Present to grasp and future still to find  The whole Employ of Body and of Mind  All  spread their Charms but charm not all  alike    On diff'rent Senses diff'rent Objects strike  Hence diff'rent Passions more or less inflame  As strong or weak the Organs of the Frame  And hence one  Master Passion  in the Breast  Like  Aaron  's Serpent swallows up the rest  As Man perhaps the moment of his Breath  Receives the lurking Principle of Death  The young Disease that must subdue at length  Grows with his growth and strengthens with his strength  So cast and mingled with his very Frame  The Mind's Disease its  ruling Passion  came  Each vital Humour which should feed the  whole    Soon flows to  this  in Body and in Soul  Whatever warms the Heart or fills the Head  As the Mind opens and its Functions spread  Imagination plies her dang'rous Art  And pours it all upon the peccant Part  Nature  its Mother  Habit  is its Nurse  Wit    Spirit    Faculties  but make it worse  Reason  itself but gives it Edge and Pow'r  As Heav'ns blest Beam turns Vinegar more sow'r  We wretched Subjects tho' to lawful Sway  In this weak  Queen  some Fav'rite still obey  Ah if she lend not Arms as well as Rules  What can she more than  tell us  we are Fools  Teach us to mourn our Nature not to mend  A sharp  Accuser  but a helpless  Friend    Or from a  Judge  turn  Pleader  to persuade  The Choice we make or justify it made  Proud of an easy Conquest all along  She but removes weak Passions for the strong  So when small Humours gather to a Gout  The Doctor fancies he has driv'n 'em out  Yes Nature's Road must ever be prefer'd  Reason is here no  Guide  but still a  Guard    'Tis her's to  rectify  not  overthrow    And treat this Passion more as Friend than Foe  Like varying Winds by  other  Passions tost  This  drives them constant to a certain Coast  Let Pow'r or Knowledge Gold or Glory please  Or oft more strong than all the Love of Ease  Thro' Life 'tis follow'd ev'n at Life's Expence  The Merchant's Toil the Sage's Indolence  The Monk's Humility the Hero's Pride  And all alike find Reason on their side  Th' Eternal Art educing Good from Ill  Grafts on this Passion our  best Principle    'Tis thus the Mercury of Man is fix'd  Strong grows the Virtue with his Nature mix'd  The Dross cements what else were too refin'd  And in one Int'rest  Body  acts with  Mind  As Fruits ungrateful to the Planter's Care  On  savage Stocks  inserted learn to bear  The surest Virtues thus from Passions shoot  Wild Nature's Vigour working at the Root  What Crops of Wit and Honesty appear  From Spleen from Obstinacy Hate or Fear  See Anger Zeal and Fortitude supply  Ev'n Av'rice Prudence Sloth Philosophy  Envy to which th' ignoble Mind's a Slave  Is Emulation in the Learn'd or Brave  Nor Virtue Male or Female can we name  But what or grows on  Pride  or grows on  Shame  Thus  Nature  gives us let it check our Pride  The Virtue nearest to our Vice ally'd  Reason  the Byass turns to Good from Ill  And  Nero  reigns a  Titus  if he will  The fiery Soul abhorr'd in  Cataline    In  Decius  charms in  Curtius  is divine  The same Ambition can destroy or save  And makes a Patriot as it makes a Knave  This  Light  and  Darkness  in our Chaos join'd  What shall divide The  God  within the  Mind  Tho' each by turns the other's bound invade  As in some wellwrought Picture Light and Shade  And oft so mix the Diff'rence is too nice  Where ends the Virtue or begins the Vice  Fools who from hence into the Notion fall  That  Vice  or  Virtue  there is none at all  If white and black blend soften and unite  A thousand ways is there no Black or White  Ask your  own Heart  and nothing is so plain  'Tis to  mistake  them costs the  Time  and  Pain  Vice is a Monster of so frightful mien  As to be hated needs but to be seen  But seen too  oft  familiar with her Face  We first endure then pity then embrace  A  Cheat  a  Whore  who starts not at the Name  In all the Inns of Court or  Drury Lane    But where the  Point of Vice  was ne'er agreed  Ask where's the  North  at  York  'tis on the  Tweed    In  Scotland  at the  Orcades  and there  At  Greenland    Zembla  or the Lord knows where  No Creature owns it in the first degree  But thinks his Neighbour further gone than he  Ev'n those who dwell beneath her very Zone  Or never feel the Rage or never own  What happier Natures shrink at with Affright  The hard Inhabitant contends is right  Virtuous and vicious ev'ry Man must be  Few in th' Extreme but all in the Degree  The Rogue and Fool by fits is fair and wise  And ev'n the best by fits what they despise  'Tis but by  Parts  we follow Good or Ill  For Vice or Virtue  Self  directs it still  Each individual seeks a sev'ral Goal  But  Heav'n  's great View is  One  and that the  Whole    That  counterworks each Folly and Caprice  That  disappoints th' Effect of ev'ry Vice  That  happy Frailties to all  Ranks  apply'd  Shame  to the Virgin to the Matron  Pride  Fear  to the Statesman  Rashness  to the Chief  To Kings  Presumption  and to Crowds  Belief  That  Virtue's Ends from  Vanity  can raise  Which seeks no Int'rest no Reward but Praise  And builds on  Wants  and on  Defects  of Mind  The  Joy  the  Peace  the  Glory  of Mankind  Heav'n forming each on other to depend  A Master or a Servant or a Friend  Bids each on other for Assistance call  Till one man's Weakness grows the Strength of all  Wants Frailties Passions closer still allye  The common Int'rest or endear the Tye  To  these  we owe true Friendship Love sincere  Each homefelt Joy that Life inherits here  Yet from the same we learn in its decline  Those Joys those Loves those Int'rests to resign  Taught half by Reason half by mere Decay  To welcome Death and calmly pass away  Whate'er the  Passion  Knowledge Fame or Pelf  Not one will change his Neighbour with himself  The Learn'd are happy Nature to explore  The Fool is happy that he knows no more  The Rich are happy in the Plenty given  The Poor contents him with the Care of Heaven  See the blind Beggar dance the Cripple sing  The Sot a Hero Lunatic a King  The starving Chymist in his golden Views  Supreamly blest the Poet in his Muse  See some strange  Comfort  ev'ry  State  attend  And Pride bestow'd on all a common Friend  See some fit  Passion  ev'ry  Age  supply  Hope  travels thro' nor quits us when we die  'Till then  Opinion  gilds with varying rays  Those painted Clouds that beautify our Days  Each want of Happiness by Hope supply'd  And each Vacuity of Sense by Pride  These build up all that Knowledge can destroy  In Folly's Cup still laughs the Bubble  Joy    One Prospect lost another still we gain  And not a Vanity is giv'n in vain  Even mean  SelfLove  becomes by Force divine  The Scale to measure others Wants by thine  See and confess one Comfort still must rise  Tis this tho'  Man's a Fool  yet GOD  is Wise  The End of

Pride and Impudence of Wealth  Let that great Truth be present Night and Day  But most be present if thou  preach  or  pray  View thy own World Behold the Chain of Love  Combining all below and all above  See lifeless Matter moving to one End  The single Atoms each to other tend  Attract attracted to the next in place  By Nature form'd its  Neighbour  to embrace  Behold it next with various Life

as to Man mistook the Matter quite  And just as short of Reason Man will fall  Who thinks  All  made for  One  not  One  for  All  Grant that the Pow'rful still the Weak controul  Be Man the  Wit  and  Tyrant  of the Whole  NATURE that Tyrant checks He only knows  And feels another Creature's Wants and Woes  Say will the Falcon stooping from above  Smit with her varying Plumage spare the Dove  Admires the Jay the Insect's gilded Wings  Or hears the Hawk when  Philomela  sings  Man cares for All To Birds he gives his Woods  To Beasts his Pastures and to Fish his Floods  For some his Int'rest

the Pain  The Creature had his Feast of Life before  Thou too must perish when thy Feast is o'er  To each unthinking Being Heav'n a Friend  Gives not the useless Knowledge of its End  To Man imparts

the Means proportion'd to their End  Say where full  Instinct  is th' unerring Guide  What  Pope  or  Council  can they need beside  Reason however able cool at best  Cares not for Service or but serves when prest  Stays till we call and then not often near  But honest Instinct comes a Volunteer  This too serves  always  Reason never  long    One  must  go right the other  may  go wrong  See

Each Sex desires alike till  two  or  one    Nor ends the Pleasure with the fierce Embrace  All love themselves a third time in their  Race  The Beast the Bird their common Charge attend  The Mothers

Things and of Man  Pride  then was not nor  Arts  that Pride to aid  Man walk'd with Beast joint Tenant of the Shade  The same his Table and the same his Bed  No Murder cloath'd him and no Murder fed  In the same Temple the resounding Wood  All Vocal Beings hymn'd their equal God  The Shrine with Gore unstain'd with Gold undrest  Unbrib'd unbloody stood the blameless Priest  Heav'n's Attribute was universal Care  And Man's Prerogative to rule but spare  Ah how unlike the Man of Times to come  Of half that live the Butcher and the Tomb  Who Foe to Nature hears the gen'ral Groan  Murders their

Nature  rising slow to  Art    To copy  Instinct  then was  Reason  's Part  Thus then to Man the Voice of Nature spake  Go from the  Creatures  thy Instructions take    Learn from the  Birds  what Food the Thickets yield    Learn from the  Beasts  the Physick of the Field    Thy Arts of Building from the  Bee  receive    Learn of the  Mole  to  plow  the  Worm  to weave    Learn of the little  Vide  Oppian Halient  lib  Nautilus  to sail    Spread the thin Oar and catch the driving Gale  Here too all  Forms  of  social Union  find    And hence let Reason late instruct Mankind    Here

Gods  adore  Great  Nature  spoke observant Men obey'd  Cities were built Societies were made  Here rose one little  State  Another near  Grew by like means and join'd thro'  Love  or  Fear  Did here

Allegiance  then  For Nature knew no  Right Divine  in  Men    No  Ill  could fear in  God  and understood  A  Sov'reign Being  but a  Sov'reign Good  True Faith true Policy united ran  That was but  Love  of  God  and this of  Man  Who first taught Souls enslav'd and Realms undone  Th' enormous Faith of  Many made for One    That proud Exception to all Nature's Laws  T' invert the World and counterwork its  Cause    Force first made  Conquest  and that Conquest  Law    'Till  Superstition  taught the Tyrant Awe  Then shar'd the Tyranny and lent it Aid  And Gods of Conqu'rors Slaves of Subjects made  She 'midst the Lightning's Blaze and Thunder's Sound  When rock'd the Mountains and when groan'd the Ground  She taught the Weak to bend the Proud to pray  To Pow'r unseen and mightier

Gods  Gods  partial changeful passionate unjust  Whose Attributes were Rage Revenge or Lust  Such as the Souls of  Cowards  might  conceive    And form'd  like Tyrants  Tyrants would  believe  Zeal then not Charity became the Guide  And  Hell  was built on  Spite  and  Heav'n  on  Pride  Then sacred seem'd th' ethereal Vault no more  Altars grew Marble then and reek'd with Gore  Then first the  Flamen  tasted living Food  Next his grim Idol smear'd with human Blood  With Heav'n's own Thunder shook the World below  And play'd the God an Engine on his Foe  So drives  SelfLove  thro' Just and thro' Unjust  To  One  Man's Pow'r Ambition Lucre Lust  The same SelfLove in  All  becomes the Cause  Of what restrains him Government and Laws  For what one likes if others like as well  What serves one Will when many Wills rebel  How shall he keep what sleeping or awake  A Weaker may surprise a stronger take  His  Safety  must his  Liberty  restrain  All  join to  guard  what  each  desires to  gain  Forc'd into Virtue thus by SelfDefence  Ev'n Kings learn'd Justice and Benevolence  SelfLove forsook the Path it first pursu'd  And found the  private  in the  publick  Good  'Twas then the studious Head or gen'rous Mind  Follow'r of God or Friend of Humankind  Poet or Patriot rose but to restore  The Faith and Moral  Nature  gave before  Relum'd her ancient Light not  kindled new    If not God's  Image  yet his  Shadow  drew  Taught Pow'r's due Use to  People  and to  Kings    Taught not to slack nor strain its tender strings  The  Less  and  Greater  set so justly true  That touching  one  must strike the  other  too  And jarring Int'rests of themselves create  Th' according Musick of a  wellmix'd State  Such is the WORLD's  great Harmony  that springs  From  Union    Order  full  Consent  of Things  Where Small and Great where Weak and Mighty made  To serve not suffer strengthen not invade  More  pow'rful  each as  needful  to the rest  And in Proportion as it

gen'rous Vine supported lives  The  Strength  he gains is from th'  Embrace  he gives  On their  own Axis  as the Planets run  Yet make at once their Circle round the  Sun    So two consistent Motions act the Soul  And one regards  Itself  and one the  Whole  Thus God and Nature link'd the gen'ral Frame  And bade  SelfLove  and  Social  be the same  The End of the Third  EPISTLE  AN ESSAY on  MAN  EPISTLE IV Of the Nature and State of Man with respect to Happiness  Happiness  ill defin'd by the Philosophers  VER  That it is the  End  of all Men and attainable by all    God governs by  general  not  particular  Laws Intends Happiness to be  equal  and to be so it must be  social  since all particular Happiness depends on general    As it is necessary for  Order  and the Peace and Welfare of  Society  that  External Goods  should be  unequal  Happiness is not made to consist in these    But notwithstanding that Inequality the Balance of Happiness among Mankind is kept even by Providence by the two Passions of  Hope  and  Fear  What the Happiness of Individuals is as far as is consistent with the Constitution of this World    That the  good Man  has here the Advantage    The Error of imputing to  Virtue  what are only the Calamities of  Nature  or of  Fortune  The Folly of expecting that God should alter his general Laws in favour of Particulars    That we are not Judges  who are good  but that whoever they are they must be  happiest  c That  external Goods  are not the proper Rewards often inconsistent with or destructive of  Virtue  But that even these can make no Man happy without Virtue Instanced in Riches    Honours    Birth    Greatness    Fame    Superior Talents    with Pictures of human Infelicity in Men possess'd of them all    c That  VIRTUR ONLY  constitutes a Happiness whose Object is  universal  and whose Prospect  eternal  The Perfection of which consists in a  Conformity  to the  Order  of  Providence  here and in a  Resignation  to it here and hereafter    Or in other Words in  Love  of  God  and  Charity  to  all Men  c to the End  O Happiness our Being's End and Aim  Good Pleasure Ease Content whate'er thy name  That Something still which prompts th'eternal sigh  For which we bear to live nor fear to die  Which still so near us yet beyond us lies  O'erlook'd seen double by the fooland wise  Plant of celestial seed if dropt below  Say in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow  Fairopening to some Court's propitious Shine  Or deep with diamonds in the flaming Mine  Twin'd with the Wreaths Parnassian Laurels yield  Or reap'd in Iron Harvests of the field  Where growswhere grows it notIf vain our toil  We ought to blame the Culture not the Soil  Fix'd to no spot is Happiness sincere  'Tis no where to be found or ev'ry where  'Tis never to be bought but always free  And fled from Monarchs  Laelius  dwells with thee  Ask of the Learn'd the Way the Learn'd are blind  This bids to serve and that to shun Mankind  Some place the bliss in Action some in Ease  Those call it Pleasure and Contentment these  Who thus define it say they more or less  Than this that Happiness is Happiness  One grants his Pleasure is but Rest from Pain  One doubts of All one owns ev'n Virtue vain  Take  Nature  's path and mad Opinions leave  All States can reach it and all Heads conceive  Obvious her Goods in no Extreme they dwell  There needs but thinking right and meaning well  And mourn our various Portions as we please  Equal is  common Sense  and  common Ease  Remember Man "the Universal Cause  "Acts not by partial but by gen'ral Laws"  And makes what Happiness we justly call  Subsist not in the Good of one but all  There's not a Blessing Individuals find  But some way leans and hearkens to the Kind  No Bandit fierce no Tyrant mad with Pride  No cavern'd Hermit rest selfsatisfy'd  Who most to shun or hate Mankind pretend  Seek an Admirer or wou'd fix a Friend  Abstract what others feel what others think  All Pleasures sicken and all Glories sink  Each has his Share and who wou'd more obtain  Shall find the Pleasure pays not half the Pain  ORDER is Heav'n's first Law and this confest  Some are and must be greater than the rest  More rich more wise but who infers from hence  That such are  happier  shocks all common Sense  Heav'n to Mankind impartial we confess  If all are equal in their Happiness  But mutual Wants this Happiness increase  All Nature's Diff'rence keeps all Nature's Peace  Condition Circumstance is not the thing  Bliss  is the same in Subject or in King  In who obtain Defence or who defend  In him who is or him who finds a Friend  Heav'n breathes thro' ev'ry Member of the whole  One common Blessing as one common Soul  But Fortune's Gifts if each alike possest  And each were equal must not all contest  If then to all Men Happiness was meant  God in Externals could not place Content  Fortune her Gifts may variously dispose  And these be call'd unhappy happy those  But Heav'n's just Balance equal will appear  While those are plac'd in Hope and these in Fear  Not present Good or Ill the Joy or Curse  But future Views of better or of worse  Oh Sons of Earth attempt ye still to rise  By Mountains pil'd on Mountains to the Skies  Heav'n still with Laughter the vain Toil surveys  And buries Madmen in the Heaps they raise  Know all the Good that Individuals find  Or God and Nature meant to meer Mankind  Reason's whole Pleasures all the Joys of Sense  Lie in three Words  Health    Peace  and  Competence  But Health consists with Temperance alone  And Peace fair Virtue Peace is all thy own  The Gifts of Fortune good or bad may gain  But these less taste them as they worse obtain  Say in Pursuit of Profit or Delight  Who risque the most that take wrong means or right  Of Vice or Virtue whether blest or curst  Which meets Contempt or which Compassion first  Count all th'Advantage prosp'rous Vice attains  'Tis but what Virtue flies from and disdains  And grant the bad what Happiness they wou'd  One they must want which is to pass for good  Oh blind to Truth and God's whole Scheme below  Who fancy Bliss to Vice to Virtue Woe  Who sees and follows that great Scheme the best  Best knows his Blessing and will most be blest  But Fools the  Good  alone unhappy call  For Ills or Accidents that chance to  All  See  Falkland  falls the virtuous and the just  See godlike  Turenne  prostrate on the Dust  See  Sidney  bleeds amid the martial Strife  Was this their  Virtue  or Contempt of Life  Say was it Virtue more tho' Heav'n ne'er gave  Lamented  Digby  sunk thee to

Or Chance escape and Man improves it all  We just as wisely might of Heav'n complain  That righteous  Abel  was destroy'd by  Cain    As that the virtuous Son is ill at Ease  When his lewd Father gave

Just agree  The Good must merit God's peculiar Care  But who but God can tell us who they are  One thinks on  Calvin  Heav'n's own Spirit fell  Another deems him Instrument of Hell  If  Calvin  feel Heav'n's Blessing or its Rod  This cries there is and that there is no God  What shocks one part will edify the rest  Nor with one System can they all be blest  Give each a System all must be at

Bread  That Vice may merit 'tis the Price of Toil  The Knave deserves it when he tills the Soil  The Knave deserves it when he tempts the Main  Where Madness fights for Tyrants or for Gain  The good

Virtue's Prize A better would you fix  And give Humility a Coach and Six  Justice a Conqu'ror's Sword or Truth a Gown  Or publick Spirit its great Cure a Crown  Rewards that either would to Virtue

Friend a wise Man and a Fool  You'll find if once the Monarch acts the Monk  Or Coblerlike the Parson will be drunk  Worth makes the Man and want of it the Fellow  The rest is all but Leather or Prunello  Stuck o'er with  Titles  and hung round with Strings  That thou may'st be by Kings or Whores of Kings  Thy boasted Blood a thousand Years or so  May from  Lucretia  to  Lucretia  flow  But

Family is young  Not own your Fathers have been Fools so long  What can enoble Sots or Slaves or Cowards  Alas not all the Blood of all the  Howards  Look next on  Greatness  say where Greatness lies  "Where but among the Heroes and the Wise"  Heroes are much the same the Point's agreed  From  Macedonia  's Madman to the  Swede    The whole strange Purpose of their Lives to find  Or make an Enemy of all Mankind  Not one looks backward onward still he goes  Yet ne'er looks forward further than his Nose  No less alike the Politick and Wise  All fly slow things with circumspective Eyes  Men in their loose unguarded Hours they take  Nor that themselves are wise but others weak  But grant that those can  conquer  these can  cheat    'Tis Phrase absurd to call a Villain  great  Who wickedly is wise or madly brave  Is but  the more  a Fool  the more  a Knave  Who noble ends by noble Means obtains  Or failing smiles in Exile or in Chains  Like good  Aurelius  let him reign or bleed  Like  Socrates  that Man is great indeed  What's Fame that fancy'd Life in others Breath  A thing beyond us ev'n before our Death  Just what you  hear  you have and what's unknown  The same my Lord if  Tully  's or your own  All that we feel of it begins and ends  In the small Circle of our Foes or Friends  To all beside as much an empty Shade  An  Eugene  living as a  Caesar  dead  Alike or when or where they shone or shine  Or on the  Rubicon  or on the  Rhine  A Wit's a  Feather  and a Chief a  Rod    An honest Man's the noblest Work of God  Fame but from Death a Villain's Name can save  As Justice tears his Body from the Grave  When what t' Oblivion better were resign'd  Is hung on high to poison half Mankind  All Fame is foreign but of true Desert  Plays round the Head but comes not to the Heart  One selfapproving Hour whole Years outweighs  Of stupid Starers and of loud Huzza's  And more true Joy  Marcellus  exil'd feels  Than  Caesar  with a Senate at his Heels  In  Parts

Without a Second or without a Judge  Truths would you teach or save a sinking Land  All fear none aid you and few understand  Painful Preheminence yourself to view  Above Life's Weakness and its Comforts too  Bring then these Blessings to a strict Account  Make fair Deductions see to what they mount  How much of other each is sure to cost  How each for other oft is wholly lost  How inconsistent greater Goods with these  How sometimes Life is risqu'd and always Ease  Think and if still the  Things  thy Envy call  Say would'st thou be the  Man  to whom they fall  To sigh for Ribbands if thou art so silly  Mark how they grace Lord  Umbra  or Sir  Billy  Is yellow Dirt the Passion of thy Life  Look but on  Gripus  or on  Gripus  ' Wife  If Parts allure thee think how  Bacon

what wretched Steps their Glory grows  From Dirt and Seaweed as proud  Venice  rose  In each how Guilt and Greatness equal ran  And all that rais'd the Hero sunk the Man  Now  Europe  's Lawrels on their Brows behold  But stain'd with Blood or ill exchang'd for Gold  Then see them broke with Toils or lost in Ease  Or infamous for plunder'd Provinces  Oh Wealth illfated which no Act of Fame  E'er

their pompous Shade  Alas not dazled with their Noontide Ray  Compute the Morn and Evening to the Day  The whole Amount of that enormous Fame  A Tale that blends their Glory with their Shame  Know then this Truth enough for Man to know  Virtue  alone is Happiness below  The only Point where human Bliss stands still  And tastes the Good without the Fall to Ill  Where only Merit constant Pay receives  Is bless'd in what it takes and what it gives  The Joy unequal'd if its End it gain  And if it lose attended with no Pain  Without Satiety tho' e'er so bless'd  And but more relish'd as the more distress'd  The broadest Mirth unfeeling Folly wears  Less pleasing far than Virtue's very Tears  Good from each Object from each Place acquir'd  For ever exercis'd yet never tir'd  Never elated while one Man's oppress'd  Never dejected while another's bless'd  And where no Wants no Wishes can remain  Since but to wish more Virtue is to gain  See the sole Bliss Heav'n could on  all  bestow  Which who but feels can taste but thinks can know  Yet poor with Fortune and with Learning blind  The Bad must miss the Good untaught will find  Slave to no Sect who takes no private Road  But looks thro'  Nature  up to  Nature  's GOD  Pursues that  Chain  which links th' immense Design  Joyns Heav'n and Earth and mortal and divine  Sees that no Being any Bliss can know  But touches some above

alone  Hope  leads from Gole to Gole  And opens still and opens on his Soul  'Till lengthen'd on to  Faith  and unconfin'd  It pours the Bliss that fills up all the Mind  He sees why Nature plants in Man alone  Hope of known Bliss and Faith in Bliss unknown  Nature whose Dictates to no other Kind  Are given in vain but what they seek they find  Wise is the Present she connects in this  His greatest  Virtue  with his greatest  Bliss    At once his own bright Prospect to be blest  And strongest Motive to assist the rest  SelfLove  thus push'd to Social to Divine  Gives thee to make thy
