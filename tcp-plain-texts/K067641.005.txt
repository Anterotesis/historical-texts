Budgell D D of St Thomas near Exeter by his first wife Mary the only daughter of Dr William Gulston bishop of Bristol whose sister Jane married dean Addison and was mother to the famous Mr Addison the secretary of state This family of Budgell is very old and has been settled and known in Devonshire above years  See Budgell's Letter to Cleomenes Appendix p    Eustace was born about the year and distinguished himself very soon at school from whence he was removed early to Christ's Church College in Oxford where he was entered a gentleman commoner He staid some years in that university and afterwards went to London where by his father's directions he was entered of the InnerTemple in order to be bred to the Bar for which his father had always intended him but instead of the Law he followed his own inclinations which carried him to the study of polite literature and to the company of the genteelest people in town This proved unlucky for the father by degrees grew uneasy at his son's not getting himself called to the Bar nor properly applying to the Law according to his r  te  ated directions and request and the son complained of the strictness and insufficiency of his father's allowance and constantly urged the necessity of his living like a gentleman and of his spending a great deal of money During this stay however at the Temple Mr Budgell made a strict intimacy and friendship with Mr Addison who was first cousin to his mother and this last gentleman being appointed in the year secretary to lord Wharton the lord lieutenant of Ireland he made an offer to his friend Eustace of going with him as one of the clerks in his office The proposal being advantageous and Mr Budgell being then on bad terms with his father and absolutely unqualified for the practice of the Law it was readily accepted Nevertheless for fear of his father's disapprobation of it he never communicated his design to him 'till the very night of his setting out for Ireland when he wrote him a letter to inform him at once of his resolution and journey This was in the beginning of April when he was about twenty five years of age He had by this time read the classics the most reputed  historians and all the best French English or Italian writers His apprehension was quick his imagination fine and his memory remarkably strong though his greatest commendations were a very genteel address a ready wit and an excellent elocution which shewed him to advantage wherever he went There was notwithstanding one principal defect in his disposition and this was an infinite vanity which gave him so insufferable a presumption as led him to think that nothing was too much for his capacity nor any preferment or favour beyond his deserts Mr Addison's fondness for him perhaps increased this disposition as he naturally introduced him into all the company he kept which at that time was the best and most ingenious in the two kingdoms In short they lived and lodged together and constantly followed the lord lieutenant into England at the same time  It was now that Mr Budgell commenced author and was partly concerned with Sir Richard Steele and Mr Addison in writing the Tatler The Spectators being set on foot in Mr Budgell had likewise a share in them as all the papers marked with an X may easily inform the reader and indeed the eighth volume was composed by Mr Addison and himself  See The Bee vol ii p  without the assistance of Sir Richard Steele The speculations of our author were generally liked and Mr Addison was frequently complimented upon the ingenuity of his kinsman About the same time he wrote an epilogue to the Distress'd Mother  'Till then it was usual to discontinue an epilogue after the sixth night But this was called for by the audience and continued for the whole run of this play Budgell did not scruple to sit in the pit and call for it himself  which had a greater run than any thing of that kind ever had before and has had this peculiar regard shewn to it since that now above thirty years afterwards it is generally spoke at the representation of that  play Several little epigrams and songs which have a good deal of wit in them were also written by Mr Budgell near this period of time all which together with the known affection of Mr Addison for him raised his character so much as to make him be very generally known and talked of  His father's death in threw into his hands all the estates of the family which were about l a year although they were left incumbered with some debts as his sather was a man of pride and spirit kept a coach and six and always lived beyond his income notwithstanding his spiritual preferments and the money he had received with his wives Dr Budgell had been twice married and by his first lady left five children living after him three of whom were sons Enstace our author Gilbert a Clergyman and William the fellow of New College in Oxford By his last wife who was Mrs Fortescue mother to the late master of the rolls and who survived him he had no issue Notwithstanding this access of fortune Mr Budgell in no wise altered his manner of living he was at small expence about his person stuck very close to business and gave general satisfaction in the discharge of his office  Upon the laying down of the Spectator the Guardian was set up and in this work our author had a hand along with Mr Addison and Sir Richard Steele In the preface it is said those papers marked with an asterisk are by Mr Budgell  In the year he published a very elegant translation of Theophrastus's Characters which Mr Addison in the Lover says  'is the best version extant of any ancient author in the English language'  It was dedicated to the lord Hallifax who was the greatest patron our author ever had and with whom he always lived in the greatest intimacy  Mr Budgell having regularly made his progress in the secretary of state's office in Ireland upon the arrival of his late Majesty in England was appointed under secretary to Mr Addison and chief secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland He was made likewise deputy clerk of the council in that kingdom and soon after chose member of the Irish parliament where he became a very good speaker The post of under secretary is reckoned worth l a year and that of deputy clerk to the council l a year Mr Budgell set out for Ireland the th of October officiated in his place in the privy council the th took possession of the secretary's office and was immediately admitted secretary to the Lords Justices In the same year at a public entertainment at the Inns of Court in Dublin he with many people of distinction was made an honorary bencher At his first entering upon the secretary's place after the removal of the tories on the accession of his late Majesty he lay under very great difficulties all the former clerks of his office refusing to serve all the books with the form of business being secreted and every thing thrown into the utmost confusion yet he surmounted these difficulties with very uncommon resolution assiduity and ability to his great honour and applause  Within a twelvemonth of his entering upon his employments the rebellion broke out and as for several years during all the absences of the lord lieutenant he had discharged the office of secretary of state and as no transport office at that time subsisted he was extraordinarily charged with the care of the embarkation and the providing of shipping which is generally the province of a fieldofficer for all the troops to be transported to Scotland However he went through this extensive and unusual complication of business with great exactness and ability and with very singular  disinterestedness for he took no extraordinary service money on this account nor any gratuity or fees for any of the commissions which passed through his office for the colonels and officers of militia then raising in Ireland The Lords Justices pressed him to draw up a warrant for a very handsome present on account of his great zeal and late extraordinary pains for he had often sat up whole nights in his office but he very genteely and firmly refused it  Mr Addison upon becoming principal secretary of state in England in procured the place of accomptant and comptroller general of the revenue in Ireland sor Mr Budgell which is worth l a year and might have had him for his under secretary but it was thought more expedient for his Majesty's service that Mr Budgell should continue where he was Our author held these several places until the year at which time the duke of Bolton was appointed lord lieutenant His grace carried one Mr Edward Webster over with him who had been an under clerk in the Treasury and made him a privy counsellor and his secretary This gentleman 'twas said insisted upon the quartering a friend on the under secretary which produced a misunderstanding between them for Mr Budgell positively declared he would never submit to any such condition whilst he executed the office and affected to treat Mr Webster himself his education abilities and family with the utmost contempt He was indiscreet enough prior to this to write a lampoon in which the lord lieutenant was not spared he would publish it so fond was he of this brat of his brain in opposition to Mr Addison's opinion who strongly persuaded him to suppress it as the publication Mr Addison said could neither serve h  s interest or reputation Hence many discontents arose between them 'till at length the lord lieutenant in support of his  secretary superseded Mr Budgell and very soon after got him removed from the place of accomptantgeneral However upon the first of these removals taking place and upon some hints being given by his private secretary captain Guy Dickens now our minister at Stockholm that it would not probably be safe for him to remain any longer in Ireland he immediately entrusted his papers and private concerns to the hands of his brother William then a clerk in his office and set out for England Soon after his arrival he published a pamphlet representing his case intituled A Letter to the Lord **** from Eustace Budgell  Esq  Accomptant General of Ireland and late Secretary to their Excellencies the Lords Justices of that Kingdom eleven hundred copies of which were sold off in one day so great was the curiosity of the public in that particular Afterwards too in the PostBoy of January he published an Advertisement to justify his character against a report that had been spread to his disadvantage and he did not scruple to declare in all companies that his life was attempted by his enemies or otherwise he should have attended his seat in the Irish Parliament His behaviour about this time made many of his friends judge he was become delirious his passions were certainly exceeding strong nor were his vanity and jealousy less Upon his coming to England he had lost no time in waiting upon Mr Addison who had resigned the seals and was retired into the country for the sake of his health but Mr Addison found it impossible to stem the tide of opposition which was every where running against his kinsman through the influence and power of the duke of Bolton He therefore disswaded him in the strongest manner from publishing his case but to no manner of purpose which made him tell a friend in great anxiety  'Mr Budgell was wiser than any man  he ever knew and yet he supposed the world would hardly believe he acted contrary to his advice'  Our author's great and noble friend the lord Hallifax was dead and my lord Orrery who held him in the highest esteem had it not in his power to procure him any redress However Mr Addison had got a promise from lord Sunderland that as soon as the present clamour was a little abated he would do something for him  Mr Budgell had held the considerable places of under secretary to the Lord Lieutenant and secretary to the Lords Justices for four years during which time he had never been absent four days from his office nor ten miles from Dublin His application was indefatigable and his natural spirits capable of carrying him through any difficulty He had lived always genteelly but frugally and had saved a large sum of money which he now engaged in the SouthSea scheme During his abode in Ireland he had collected materials for writing a History of that kingdom for which he had g  eat advantages by having an easy recourse to all the public offices but what is become of it and whether he ever finished it we are not certainly informed It is undoubtedly a considerable loss because there is no tolerable history of that nation and because we might have expected a satisfactory account from so pleasing a writer  He wrote a pamphlet after he came to England against the famous Peerage Bill which was very well received by the public but highly offended the earl of Sunderland It was exceedingly cried up by the opposition and produced some overtures of friendship at the time from Mr Robert Walpole to our author Mr Addison's death in the year put an end however to all his hopes of succeeding at court where he continued nevertheless to make several attempts but was constantly kept down by the weight of the duke of  Bolton In the September of that year he went into France through all the strong places in Flanders and Brabant and all the considerable towns in Holland and then went to Hanover from whence he returned with his Majesty's retinue the November following  But the fatal year of the SouthSea ruined our author entirely for he lost above l in it however he was very active on that occasion and made many speeches at the general courts of the SouthSea Company in MerchantTaylors Hall and one in particular which was afterwards printed both in French and English and run to a third edition And in he published a pamphlet with success called A Letter to a Friend in the Country occasioned by a Report that there is a Design still forming by the late Directors of the SouthSea Company their Agents and Associates to issue the Receipts of the d and th Subscriptions at l per Cent and to extort about Millions more from the miserable People of Great Britain with some Observations on the present State of Affairs both at Home and Abroad In the same year he published A Letter to Mr Law upon his Arrival in Great Britain which run through seven editions very soon Not long afterwards the duke of Portland whose fortune had been likewise destroyed by the SouthSea was appointed governor of Jamaica upon which he immediately told Mr Budgell he should go with him as his secretary and should always live in the same manner with himself and that he would contrive every method of making the employment profitable and agreeable to him but his grace did not know how obnoxious our author had rendered himself for within a few days after this offer's taking air he was acquainted in form by a secretary of state that if he thought of Mr Budgell the government would appoint another governor in his room  After being deprived of this last resource he tried to get into the next parliament at several places and spent near l in unsuccessful attempts which compleated his ruin And from this period he began to behave and live in a very different manner from what he had ever done before wrote libellous pamphlets against Sir Robert Walpole and the ministry and did many unjust things with respect to his relations being distracted in his own private fortune as indeed he was judged to be in his senses torturing his invention to find out ways of subsisting and eluding his illstars his pride at the same time working him up to the highest pitches of resentment and indignation against all courts and courtiers  His younger brother the fellow of NewCollege who had more weight with him than any body had been a clerk under him in Ireland and continued still in the office and who bad fair for rising in it died in the year and after that our author seemed to pay no regard to any person Mr William Budgell was a man of very good sense extremely steady in his conduct and an adept in all calculations and mathematical questions and had besides great goodnature and easiness of temper  Our author as I before observed perplexed his private affairs from this time as much as possible and engaged in numberless lawsuits which brought him into distresses that attended him to the end of his life  In Mr Budgell had a l given him by the late Sarah duchess dowager of Marlborough to whose husband the famous duke of Marlborough he was a relation by his mother's side with a view to his getting into parliament She knew he had a talent for speaking in public and that he was acquainted with business and would probably run any lengths against the ministry However this scheme failed for he could never get chosen  In the year and about that time he closed in with the writers against the administration and wrote many papers in the Craftsman He likewise published a pamphlet intitled A Letter to the Craftsman from E Budgell  Esq  occasioned by his late presenting an humble complaint against the right honourable Sir Robert Walpole with a Postscript This ran to a ninth edition Near the same time too he wrote a Letter to Cleomenes King of Sparta from E Budgell  Esq  being an Answer Paragraph by Paragraph to his Spartan Majesty's Royal Epistle published some time since in the Daily Courant with some Account of the Manners and Government of the Antient Greeks and Romans and Political Reflections thereon And not long after there came out A State of one of the Author's Cases before the House of Lords which is generally printed with the Letter to Cleomenes He likewise published on the same occasion a pamphlet which he calls Liberty and Property by E Budgell  Esq  wherein he complains of the seizure and loss of many valuable papers and particularly a collection of Letters from Mr Addison lord Hallifax Sir Richard Steele and other people which he designed to publish and soon after he printed a sequel or second part under the same title  The same year he also published his Poem upon his Majesty's Journey to Cambridge and Newmarket and dedicated it to the Queen Another of his performances is a poetical piece intitled A Letter to his Excellency Ulrick D'Ypres and C in Answer to his excellency's two Epistles in the DailyCourant with a Word or Two to Mr Osborn the Hyp Doctor and C These several performances were very well received by the public  In the year he began a weekly pamphlet in the nature of a Magazine though more judiciously composed called The Bee which he continued for about Numbers that bind into eight  Volumes Octavo but at last by quarrelling with his booksellers and filling his pamphlet with things entirely relating to himself he was obliged to drop it During the progress of this work Dr Tindall's death happened by whose will Mr Budgell had l left him and the world being surprised at such a gift immediately imputed it to his making the will himself This produced a paperwar between him and Mr Tindall the continuator of Rapin by which Mr Budgell's character considerably suffered and this occasioned his Bee's being turned into a meer vindication of himself  It is thought he had some hand in publishing Dr Tind  ll's Christianity as old as the Creation and he often talked of another additional volume on the same subject but never published it However he used to enquire very frequently after Dr Conybear's health who had been employed by her late majesty to answer the first and had been rewarded with the dean  ry of ChristChurch for his pains saying he hoped Mr Dean would live a little while longer that he might have the pleasure of making him a bishop for he intended very soon to publish the other volume of Tindall which would do the business Mr Budgell promised likewise a volume of several curious pieces of Tindall's that had been committed to his charge with the life of the doctor but never fulfilled his promise  Vide Bee Vol II page    During the publication of the Bee a smart pamphlet came out called A Short History of Prime Ministers which was generally believed to be written by our author and in the same year he published A Letter to the Merchants and Tradesmen of London and Bristol upon their late glorious behaviour against the Excise Law  After the extinction of the Bee our author became so involved with lawsuits and so incapable of living in the manner he wished and affected to  do that he was reduced to a very unhappy situation He got himself call'd to the bar and attended for some time in the courts of law but finding it was too late to begin that profession and too difficult for a man not regularly trained to it to get into business he soon quitted it And at last after being cast in several of his own suits and being distressed to the utmost he determined to make away with himself He had always thought very loosely of revelation and latterly became an avowed deist which added to his pride greatly disposed him to this resolution  Accordingly within a few days after the loss of his great cause and his estates being decreed for the satisfaction of his creditors in the year he took boat at SomersetStairs after filling his pockets with stones upon the beach ordered the waterman to shoot the bridge and whilst the boat was going under it threw himself overboard Several days before he had been visibly distracted in his mind and almost mad which makes such an action the less wonderful  He was never married but left one natural daughter behind him who afterwards took his name and was lately an actress at DruryLane  It has been said Mr Budgell was of opinion that when life becomes uneasy to support and is overwhelmed with clouds and sorrows that a man has a natural right to take it away as it is better not to live than live in pain The morning before he carried his notion of selfmurder into execution he endeavoured to persuade his daughter to accompany him which she very wisely refused His argument to induce her was life is not worth the holdingUpon Mr Budgell's beauroe was found a slip of paper in which were written these words  What Cato did and Addison approv'd  Alluding to Cato's destroying himself    Cannot be wrong  Mr Budgell had undoubtedly strong natural parts an excellent education and set out in life with every advantage that a man could wish being settled in very great and profitable employments at a very early age by Mr Addison But by excessive vanity and indiscretion proceeding from a false estimation of his own weight and consequence he overstretched himself and ruined his interest at court and by the succeeding loss of his fortune in the SouthSea was reduced too low to make any other head against his enemies The unjustifiable and dishonourable lawsuits he kept alive in the remaining part of his life seem to be intirely owing to the same disposition which could never submit to the living beneath what he had once done and from that principle he kept a chariot and house in London to the very last  His end was like that of many other people of spirit reduced to great streights for some of the greatest as well as some of the most infamous men have laid violent hands upon themselves As an author where he does not speak of himself and does not give a loose to his vanity he is a very agreeable and deserving writer not argumentative or deep but very ingenious and entertaining and his stile is peculiarly elegant so as to deserve being ranked in that respect with Addison's and is superior to most of the other English writers His Memoirs of the Orrery Family and the Boyle's is the most indifferent of his performances though the translations of Phalaris's Epistles in that work are done with great spirit and beauty  As to his brothers the second Gilbert was thought a man of deeper learning and better judgment when he was young than our author but was certainly inferior to him in his appearance in life and 'tis thought greatly inferior to him in every respect He was author of a pretty Copy of Verses in the VIIIth Vol of the Spectators Numb which begins thus  Conceal fond man conceal the mighty smart  Nor tell Corinna she has fir'd thy heart  And it is said that it was a repulse from a lady of great fortune with whom he was desperately in love whilst at Oxford and to whom he had addressed these lines that made him disregard himself ever after neglect his studies and fall into a habit of drinking Whatever was the occasion of this last vice it ruined him A lady had commended and desired to have a copy of his Verses once and he sent them with these lines on the first leaf  Lucretius hence thy maxim I abjure  Nought comes from nought nothing can nought procure  If to these lines your approbation's join'd  Something I'm sure from nothing has been coin'd  This gentleman died unmarried a little after his brother Eustace at Exeter having lived in a very disreputable manner for some time and having degenerated into such excessive indolence that he usually picked up some boy in the streets and carried him into the coffeehouse to read the newspapers to him He had taken deacon's orders some years before his death but had always been averse to that kind of life and therefore became it very ill and could never be prevailed upon to be a priest  The third brother William fellow of NewCollege in Oxford died as I mentioned before one of the clerks in the Irish secretary of state's office very young He had been deputy accomptant general both to his brother and his successor and likewise deputy to Mr Addison as keeper of the records in BirminghamTower Had he lived 'tis  probable he would have made a considerable figure being a man of sound sense and learning with great prudence and honour His cousin Dr Downes then bishop of LondonDerry was his zealous friend and Dr Lavington the present bishop of Exeter his fellowcollegian was his intimate correspondent Of the two sisters the eldest married captain Graves of Thanks near Saltash in Cornwall a seaofficer and died in leaving some children behind her and the other is still alive unmarried The father Dr Gilbert Budgell was esteemed a sensible man and has published a discourse upon Prayer and some Sermons  There is an Epigram of our author's which I don't remember to have seen published any where written upon the death of a very fine young lady  She was she is  What can there more be said  On Earth the first  In Heav'n the second Maid  See a Song of our author's in Stee'e's Miscellanies published in Page  There is an Epigram of his printed in the same book and in many collections Upon a Company of had Dancers to good Music  How ill the motion with the music suits  So fiddled Orpheusand so danc'd the Brutes    THOMAS TICKELL  Esq  THIS Gentleman well known to the world by the friendship and intimacy which subsisted between him and Mr Addison was the son of the revd Mr Richard Tickell who enjoy'd a considerable preferment in the North of England Our poet received his education at Queen'sCollege in Oxford of which he was a fellow  While he was at that university he wrote a beautiful copy of verses addressed to Mr Addison on his Opera of Rosamond These verses contained many elegant compliments to the author in which he compares his softness to Corelli and his strength to Virgil  Jacob    The Opera first Italian masters taught  Enrich'd with songs but innocent of thought  Britannia's learned theatre disdains  Melodious trifles and enervate strains  And blushes on her injur'd stage to see  Nonsense welltun'd with sweet stupidity  No charms are wanting to thy artful song  Soft as Corelli and as Virgil strong  These complimentary lines a few of which we have now quoted so effectually recommended him to Mr Addison that he held him in esteem ever  afterwards and when he himself was raised to the dignity of secretary of state he appointed Mr Tickell his undersecretary Mr Addison being obliged to resign on account of his illstate of health Mr Craggs who succeeded him continued Mr Tickell in his place which he held till that gentleman's death When Mr Addison was appointed secretary being a diffident man he consulted with his friends about disposing such places as were immediately dependent on him He communicated to Sir Richard Steele his design of preferring Mr Tickell to be his undersecretary which Sir Richard who considered him as a petulant man warmly opposed He observed that Mr Tickell was of a temper too enterprising to be governed and as he had no opinion of his honour he did not know what might be the consequence if by insinuation and flattery or by bolder means he ever had an opportunity of raising himself It holds pretty generally true that diffident people under the appearance of distrusting their own opinions are frequently positive and though they pursue their resolutions with trembling they never fail to pursue them Mr Addison had a little of this temper in him He could not be persuaded to set aside Mr Tickell nor even had secrecy enough to conceal from him Sir Richard's opinion This produced a great animosity between Sir Richard and Mr Tickell which subsisted during their lives  Mr Tickell in his life of Addison prefixed to his own edition of that great man's works throws out some unmannerly reflexions against Sir Richard who was at that time in Scotland as one of the commissioners on the sorfeited estates Upon Sir Richard's return to London he dedicates to Mr Congreve Addison's Comedy called the Drummer in which he takes occasion very smartly to re  ort upon Tickell and clears himself of the imputation laid to his charge namely that of valuing himself upon Mr Addison's papers in the Spectator  In June Mr Tickell was appointed secretary to the Lords Justices in Ireland a place says Mr Coxeter which he held till his death which happened in the year  It does not appear that Mr Tickell was in any respect ungrateful to Mr Addison to whom he owed his promotion on the other hand we find him take every opportunity to celebrate him which he always performs with so much zeal and earnestness that he seems to have retained the most lasting sense of his patron's favours His poem to the earl of Warwick on the death of Mr Addison is very pathetic He begins it thus  If dumb too long the drooping Muse hath stray'd  And left her debt to Addison unpaid  Blame not her silence Warwick but bemoan  And judge O judge my bosom by your own  What mourner ever felt poetic fires  Slow comes the verse that real woe inspires  Grief unaffected suits but ill with art  Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart  Mr Tickell's works are printed in the second volume of the Minor Poets and he is by far the most considerable writer amongst them He has a very happy talent in versification which much exceeds Addison's and is inferior to few of the English Poets Mr Dryden and Pope excepted The first poem in this collection is addressed to the supposed author of the Spectator  In the year Mr Tickell wrote a poem called The Prospect of Peace addressed to his excellency the lord privyseal which met with so favourable a reception from the public as to go thro' six editions The sentiments in this poem are natural and obvious but no way extraordinary It is an  assemblage of pretty notions poetically expressed but conducted with no kind of art and altogether without a plan The following exordium is one of the most shining parts of the poem  Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's stormy shore  The drum's harsh music and the cannon's roar  Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain  Where Tartar clans and grizly Cossacks reign  Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to Matrons cries  See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes  To death grey heads and smiling infants doom  Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb  O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command  The savage lord of an unpeopled land  Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws  From pure religion and impartial laws  To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings  And holds in equal scales the rival kings  Her gen'rous sons in choicest gifts abound  Alike in arms alike in arts renown'd  The Royal Progress This poem is mentioned in the Spectator in opposition to such performances as are generally written in a swelling stile and in which the bombast is mistaken for the sublime It is meant as a compliment to his late majesty on his arrival in his British dominions  An imitation of the Prophesy of Nereus Horace Book I Ode XVThis was written about the year and intended as a ridicule upon the enterprize of the earl of Marr which he prophesies will be crushed by the duke of Argyle  An Epistle from a Lady in England to a gentleman at Avignon Of this piece five editions were sold it is written in the manner of a Lady to a Gentleman whose

cannot receive a greater injury than to have his verses placed in contradistinction to Pope's Mr Melmoth in his Letters published under the name of Fitz Os  orne has produced some parallel passages little to the advantage of Mr Tickell who if he fell greatly short of the elegance and beauty of Pope has yet much exceeded Mr Congreve in what he has attempted of Homer  In the life of Addison some farther particulars concerning this translation are related and Sir Richard Steele in his dedication of the Drummer to Mr Congreve gives it as his opinion that Addison was himself the author  These translations published at the same time were certainly meant as rivals to one another We cannot convey a more adequate idea of this than in the words of Mr Pope in a Letter to James Craggs  Esq  dated July the th  'SIR  'They tell me the busy part of the nation are not more busy about Whig and Tory than these idle fellows of the feather about Mr Tickell's and my translation I like the Tories have the town in general that is the mob on my side but it is usual with the smaller part to make up in industry what they want in number and that is the case with the little senate of Cato However if our principles be well considered I must appear a brave Whig and Mr Tickell a rank Tory I translated Homer for the public in general he to gratify the inordinate desires of one man only We have it seems a

as we do with the Grand Monarch who has too many great qualities not to be respected though we know he watches any occasion to oppress us'  Thus we have endeavoured to exhibit an Idea of the writings of Mr Tickell a man of a very elegant genius As there appears no great invention in his works if he cannot be placed in the first rank of Poets yet from the beauty of his numbers and the real poetry which enriched his imagination he has at least an unexceptionable claim to the second  Mr WILLIAM HINCHLIFFE  WAS the son of a reputable tradesman of St Olave's in Southwark and was born there May was educated at a private grammar school with his intimate and ingenious friend Mr Henry Needler He made a considerable progress in classical learning and had a poetical genius He served an apprenticeship to Mr Arthur Bettesworth Bookseller in London and afterwards followed that business himself near thirty years under the Royal Exchange with reputation and credit having the esteem and friendship of many eminent merchants and gentlemen In he married Jane one of the daughters of Mr William Leigh an eminent citizen Mrs Hinchliffe was sister of William Leigh  Esq  one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the county of Surry and of the revd Thomas Leigh late rector of Heyford in Oxfordshire by whom he had two sons and three daughters of which only one son and one daughter are now living He died September and was buried in the parish church of St Margaret's Lothbury London  In he had the honour to present an Ode to King George I on his Arrival at Greenwich which is printed in a Collection of Poems Amorous Moral and Divine which he published in octavo and dedicated them to his friend Mr Needler  He published a History of the Rebellion of and dedicated it to the late Duke of Argyle  He made himself master of the French tongue by his own application and study and in published a Translation of Boulainviller's Life of Mahomet which is well esteemed and dedicated it to his intimate and worthy friend Mr William Duncombe  Esq  He was concerned with others in the publishing several other ingenious performances and has left behind him in manuscript a Translation of the nine first Books of Telemachus in blank Verse which cost him great labour but he did not live to finish the remainder  He is the author of a volume of poems in vo many of which are written with a true poetical spirit  The INVITATION  This piece is not in Mr Hinchliffe's works but is assuredly his      O come Lavinia lovely maid  Said Dion stretch'd at ease  Beneath the walnut's fragrant shade  A

the Law In this profession he seems not to have made any great figure By some means or other he conceived an aversion to Dr Swift for his abuse of whom the world taxed him with ingratitude Concanen had once enjoyed some degree of Swift's favour who was not always very happy in the choice of his companions He had an opportunity of reading some of the Dr's poems in MS which it is said he thought fit to appropriate and publish as his own  As affairs did not much prosper with him in Ireland he came over to London in company with another gentleman and both commenced writers These two friends entered into an extraordinary agreement As the subjects which then attracted the attention of mankind were of a political cast they were of opinion that no species of writing could so soon recommend them to public notice and in order to make their trade more profitable they resolved to espouse different interests one should oppose and the other defend the ministry They determined the side of the question each was to espouse by tossing up a halfpenny and it fell to the share of Mr Concanen to defend the ministry which  task he performed with as much ability as political writers generally discover  He was for some time concerned in the British and London Journals and a paper called The Speculatist These periodical pieces are long since buried in neglect and perhaps would have even sunk into oblivion had not Mr Pope by his satyrical writings given them a kind of disgraceful immortality In these Journals he published many scurrilities against Mr Pope and in a pamphlet called The Supplement to the Profound he used him with great virulence and little candour He not only imputed to him Mr Brome's verses for which he might indeed seem in some degree accountable having corrected what that gentleman did but those of the duke of Buckingham and others To this rare piece some body humorously perswaded him to take for his motto De profundis clamavi He afterwards wrote a paper called The Daily Courant wherein he shewed much spleen against lord Bolingbroke and some of his friends All these provocations excited Mr Pope to give him a place in his Dunciad In his second book l when he represents the dunces diving in the mud of the Thames for the prize he speaks thus of Concanen  True to the bottom see Concanen creep  A cold long winded native of the deep  If perseverance gain the diver's prize  Not everlasting Blackmore this denies  In the year Mr Concanen published a volume of poems in vo consisting chiefly of compositions of his own and some few of other gentlemen they are addressed to the lord Gage whom he endeavours artfully to flatter without  offending his modesty  'I shall begin this Address says he by declaring that the opinion I have of a great part of the following verses is the highest indication of the esteem in which I hold the noble character I present them to Several of them have authors whose names do honour to whatever patronage they receive As to my share of them since it is too late after what I have already delivered to give my opinion of them I'll say as much as can be said in their favour I'll affirm that they have one mark of merit which is your lordship's approbation and that they are indebted to fortune for two other great advantages a place in good company and an honourable protection'  The gentlemen who assisted Concanen in this collection were Dean Swift Mr Parnel Dr Delany Mr Brown Mr Ward and Mr Stirling In this collection there is a poem by Mr Concanen called A Match at Football in three Cantos written 'tis said in imitation of The Rape of the Lock This performance is far from being despicable the versification is generally smooth the design is not ill conceived and the characters not unnatural It perhaps would be read with more applause if The Rape of the Lock did not occur to the mind and by forcing a comparison destroy all the satisfaction in perusing it as the disproportion is so very considerable We shall quote a few lines from the beginning of the third canto by which it will appear that Concanen was not a bad rhimer  In days of yore a lovely country maid  Rang'd o'er these lands and thro' these forests stray'd  Modest her pleasures matchless was her frame  Peerless her face and Sally was her name  By no frail vows her young desires were bound  No shepherd yet the way to please her found  Thoughtless of love the beauteous nymph appear'd  Nor hop'd its transpor  s nor its torments fear'd  But careful fed her flocks and grac'd the plain  She lack'd no pleasure and she felt no pain  She view'd our motions when we toss'd the ball  And smil'd to see us take or ward a fall  Till once our leader chanc'd the nymph to spy  And drank in poison from her lovely eye  Now pensive grown he shunn'd the longlov'd plains  His darling pleasures and his favour'd swains  Sigh'd in her absence sigh'd when she was near  Now big with hope and now dismay'd with fear  At length with falt'ring tongue he press'd the dame  For some returns to his unpity'd flame  But she disdain'd his suit despis'd his care  His form unhandsome and his bristled hair  Forward she sprung and with an eager pace  The god pursu'd nor fainted in the race  Swi  t as the frighted hind the virgin flies  When the woods ecchoe to the hunters cries  Swi  t as the fleetest hound her flight she trac'd  When o'er the lawns the frighted hind is chac'd  The winds which sported with her flowing vest  Display'd new charms and heightened all the rest  Those charms display'd increas'd the gods desire  What cool'd her bosom set his breast on fire  With equal speed for diff  rent ends they move  Fear lent the virgin wings the shepherd love  Panting at length thus in her fright she pray'd  Be quick ye pow'rs and save a wretched maid  Protect my honour shelter me from shame  Beauty and life with pleasure I disclaim  Mr Concanen was also concerned with the late Mr Roome and a certain eminent senator in making The Jovial Crew an old Comedy into a Ballad Opera which was performed about the year and the profits were given entirely to Mr Concanen Soon after he was preferred to be attorneygeneral in Jamaica a post of considerable eminence and attended with a very large income In this island he spent the remaining part of his days and we are informed made a tolerable accession of fortune by marrying a planter's daughter who surviving him was left in the possession of several hundred pounds a year She came over to England after his death and married the honourable Mr Hamilton  RICHARD SAVAGE  Esq  THIS unhappy gentleman who led a course of life imbittered with the most severe calamities was not yet destitute of a friend to close his eyes It has been remarked of Cowley who likewise experienced many of the vicissitudes of fortune that he was happy in the acquaintance of the bishop of Rochester who performed the last offices which can be paid to a poet in the elegant Memorial he made of his Life Though Mr Savage was as much inferior to Cowley in genius as in the rectitude of his life yet in some respect he bears a resemblance to that great man None of the poets have been more honoured in the commemoration of their history than this gentleman The life of Mr Savage was written some years after his death by a gentleman who knew him intimately capable to distinguish between his follies and those good qualities which were often concealed from the bulk of mankind by the abjectness of his condition From this account  However slightly the author of Savage's life passes over the less amiable characteristics of that unhappy man yet we cannot but discover therein that vanity and ingratitude were the principal ingredients in poor Savage's composition nor was his veracity greatly to be depended on No wonder therefore if the goodnatur'd writer suffer'd his better understanding to be misled in some accounts relative to the poet we are now speaking ofAmong many we shall at present only take notice of the following which makes too conspicuous a figure to pass by entirely unnoticed In this life of Savage 'tis related that Mrs Oldfield was very fond of Mr Savage's conversation and allowed him an annuity during her life of lThese facts are equally illgroundedThere was no foundation for them That Savage's misfortunes pleaded for pity and had the desir'd effect on Mrs Oldfield's compassion is certainBut she so much disliked the man and disapproved his conduct that she never admitted him to her conversation nor suffer'd him to enter her house She indeed often relieved him with such donations as spoke her generous dispositionBut this was on the sollicitation of friends who frequently set his calamities before her in the most piteous light and from a principle of humanity she became not a little instrumental in saving his life  we have compiled that which we now present to the reader  In the year Anne countess of Macclesfield having lived for some time on very uneasy terms with her husband thought a public confession of adultery the most expeditious method of obtaining her liberty and therefore declared the child with which she then was big was begotten by the earl of Rivers This circumstance soon produced a separation which while the earl of Macclesfield was prosecuting the countess on the th of January was delivered of our author and the earl of Rivers by appearing to consider him as his own left no room to doubt of her declaration However strange it may appear the countess looked upon her son from his birth with a kind of resentment and abhorrence No sooner was her son born than she discovered a resolution of disowning him in a short time removed him from her sight and committed him to the care of a poor woman whom she directed to educate him as her own and enjoined her never to inform him of his true parents Instead of defending his tender years she took delight to see him struggling with misery and continued her persecution from the first hour of his life to the last with an implacable and restless cruelty His mother indeed could not affect others with the same barbarity and though she whose tender sollicitudes  should have supported him had launched him into the ocean of life yet was he not wholly abandoned The lady Mason mother to the countess undertook to transact with the nurse and superintend the education of the child She placed him at a grammar school near St Albans where he was called by the name of his nurse without the least intimation that he had a claim to any other While he was at this school his father the earl of Rivers was seized with a distemper which in a short time put an end to his life While the earl lay on h  s deathbed he thought it his duty to provide for him amongst his other natural children and therefore demanded a positive account of him His mother who could no longer refuse an answer determined at least to give such as should deprive him for ever of that happiness which competency affords and declared him dead which is perhaps the first instance of a falshood invented by a mother to deprive her son of a provision which was designed him by another The earl did not imagine that there could exist in nature a mother that would r  in her son without enriching herself and therefore bestowed upon another son six thousand pounds which he had before in his will bequeathed to Savage The same cruelty which incited her to inte  cept this provision intended him suggested another project worthy of such a disposition She endeavoured to rid herself from the danger of being at any time made known to him by sending him secretly to the American Plantations but in this contrivance her malice was defeated  Being still restless in the persecution of her son she f  med another scheme of burying him in poverty and obscurity and that the state of his life if not the place of his residence might keep him for ever at a distance from her she ordered him to be placed with a Sho  maker in Holbourn  that after the usual time of trial he might become his apprentice It is generally reported that this project was for some time successful and that Savage was employed at the awl longer than he was willing to confess but an unexpected discovery determined him to quit his occupation  About this time his nurse who had always treated him as her own son died and it was natural for him to take care of those effects which by her death were as he imagined become his own He therefore went to her house opened her boxes examined her papers and found some letters written to her by the lady Mason which informed him of his birth and the reasons for which it was concealed  He was now no longer satisfied with the employment which had been allotted him but thought he had a right to share the affluence of his mother and therefore without scruple applied to her as her son and made use of every art to awake her tenderness and attract her regard It was to no purpose that he frequently sollicited her to admit him to see her she avoided him with the utmost precaution and ordered him to be excluded from her house by whomsoever he might be introduced and what reason soever he might give for entering it  Savage was at this time so touched with the discovery of his real mother that it was his frequent practice to walk in the dark evenings for several hours before her door in hopes of seeing her by accident  But all his assiduity was without effect for he could neither soften her heart nor open her hand and while he was endeavouring to  o  se the affections of a mother he was reduced to the miseries of want In this situation he was obliged to find other means of support and became by necessity an author  His first attempt in that province was a poem against the bishop of Bangor whose controversy at that time engaged the attention of the nation and furnished the curious with a topic of dispute Of this performance Mr Savage was afterwards ashamed as it was the crude effort of a yet uncultivated genius He then attempted another kind of writing and while but yet eighteen offered a comedy to the stage built upon a Spanish plot which was refused by the players Upon this he gave it to Mr Bullock who at that time rented the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields of Mr Rich and with messieurs Keene Pack and others undertook the direction thereof Mr Bullock made some slight alterations and brought it upon the stage under the title of Woman's a Riddle but allowed the real author no part of the profit This occasioned a quarrel between Savage and Bullock but it ended without bloodshed though not without high words Bullock insisted he had a translation of the Spanish play from whence the plot was taken given him by the same lady who had bestowed it on SavageWhich was not improbable as that whimsical lady had given a copy to several others  Not discouraged however at this repulse he wrote two years after Love in a Veil another Comedy borrowed likewise from the Spanish but with little better success than before for though it was received and acted yet it appeared so late in the year that Savage obtained no other advantage from it than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steele and Mr Wilks by whom says the author of his Life he was pitied caressed and relieved Sir Richard Steele declared in his favour with that genuine benevolence which constituted his character promoted his interest with the utmost zeal and taking all opportunities of recommending him he asserted '  that the inhumanity of his mother had  given him a right to find every good man his father'  Nor was Mr Savage admitted into his acquaintance only but to his confidence and esteem Sir Richard intended to have established him in some settled scheme of life and to have contracted a kind of alliance with him by marrying him to a natural daughter on whom he intended to bestow a thousand pounds But Sir Richard conducted his affairs with so little oeconomy that he was seldom able to raise the sum which he had offered and the marriage was consequently delayed In the mean time he was officiously informed that Mr Savage had ridiculed him by which he was so much exasperated that he withdrew the allowance he had paid him and never afterwards admitted him to his house  He was now again abandoned to fortune without any other friend but Mr Wilks a man to whom calamity seldom complained without relief He naturally took an unfortunate wit into his protection and not only assisted him in any casual distresses but continued an equal and steady kindness to the time of his death By Mr Wilks's interposition Mr Savage once obtained of his mother fifty pounds and a promise of one hundred and fifty more but it was the fate of this unhappy man that few promises of any advantage to him were ever performed  Being thus obliged to depended upon Mr Wilks he was an assiduous frequenter of the theatres and in a short time the amusements of the stage took such a possession of his mind that he was never absent from a play in several years  In the year Mr Savage brought another piece on the stage He made choice of the subject of Sir Thomas Overbury If the circumstances in which he wrote it be considered it will afford at once an uncommon proof of strength of genius and an evenness of mind not to be ruffled During  a considerable part of the time in which he was employed upon this performance he was without lodging and often without food nor had he any other conveniencies for study than the fields or the street in which he used to walk and form his speeches and afterwards step into a shop beg for a few moments the use of pen and ink and write down what he had composed upon paper which he had picked up by accident  Mr Savage had been for some time distinguished by Aaron Hill  Esq  with very particular kindness and on this occasion it was natural to apply to him as an author of established reputation He therefore sent this Tragedy to him with a few verses in which he desired his correction Mr Hill who was a man of unbounded humanity and most accomplished politeness readily complied with his request and wrote the prologue and epilogue in which he touches the cirumstances of the author with great tenderness  Mr Savage at last brought his play upon the stage but not till the chief actors had quitted it and it was represented by what was then called the summercompany In this Tragedy Mr Savage himself performed the part of Sir Thomas Overbury with so little success that he always blotted out his name from the list of players when a copy of his Tragedy was to be shewn to any of his friends This play however procured him the notice and esteem of many persons of distinction for some rays of genius glimmered thro' all the mists which poverty and oppression had spread over it The whole profits of this performance acted printed and dedicated amounted to about l But the generosity of Mr Hill did not end here he promoted the subseription to his Miscellanies by a  very pathetic representation of the author's sufferings printed in the PlainDealer a periodical paper written by Mr Hill This generous effort in his favour soon produced him seventyguineas which were left for him at Button's by some who commiserated his misfortunes  Mr Hill not only promoted the subscription to the Miscellany but furnished likewise the greatest part of the poems of which it is composed and particularly the Happy Man which he published as a specimen To this Miscellany he wrote a preface in which he gives an account of his mother's cruelty in a very uncommon strain of humour which the success of his subscriptions probably inspired  Savage was now advancing in reputation and though frequently involved in very perplexing nec  ssities appeared however to be gaining on mankind when both his fame and his life were endangered by an event of which it is not yet determined whether it ought to be mentioned as a crime or a calamity As this is by far the most interesting circumstance in the life of this unfortunate man we shall relate the particulars minutely  On the th of November Mr Savage came from Richmond where he had retired that he might pursue his studies with less interruption with an intent to discharge a lodging which he had in Westminster and accidentally meeting two gentlemen of his acquaintance whose names were Marchant and Gregory he went in with them to a neighbouting CoffeeHouse and sat drinking till it was late He would willingly have gone to bed in the same house but there was not room for the whole company and therefore they agreed to ramble about the streets and divert themselves with  such amusements as should occur till morning In their walk they happened unluckily to discover light in Robinson's CoffeeHouse near CharingCross and went in Marchant with some rudeness demanded a room and was told that there was a good fire in the next parlour which the company were about to leave being then paying their reckoning Marchant not satisfied with this answer rushed into the room and was followed by his companions He then petulantly placed himself between the company and the fire and soon afterwards kicked down the table This produced a quarrel swords were drawn on both sides and one Mr James Sinclair was killed Savage having wounded likewise a maid that held him forced his way with Gregory out of the house but being intimidated and confus'd without resolution whether to fly or stay they were taken in a back court by one of the company and some soldiers whom he had called to his assistance  When the day of the trial came on the court was crowded in a very unusual manner and the public appeared to interest itself as in a cause of general concern The witnesses against Mr Savage and his friends were the woman who kept the house which was a house of illfame and her maid the men who were in the room with Mr Sinclair and a woman of the town who had been drinking with them and with whom one of them had been seen in bed  They swore in general that Marchant gave the provocation which Savage and Gregory drew their swords to justify that Savage drew first that he stabb'd Sinclair when he was not in a posture of defence or while Gregory commanded his sword that after he had given the thrust he turned pale  and would have retired but that the maid clung round him and one of the company endeavoured to detain him from whom he broke by cutting the maid on the head  Sinclair had declared several times before his death for he survived that night that he received his wound from Savage nor did Savage at his trial deny the fact but endeavoured partly to extenuate it by urging the suddenness of the whole action and the impossibility of any ill design or premeditated malice and partly to justify it by the necessity of selfdefence and the hazard of his own life if he had lost that opportunity of giving the thrust He observed that neither reason nor law obliged a man to wait for the blow which was threatened and which if he should suffer he might never be able to return that it was always allowable to prevent an assault and to preserve life by taking away that of the adversary by whom it was endangered  With regard to the violence with which he endeavoured his escape he declared it was not his design to fly from justice or decline a trial but to avoid the expences and severities of a prison and that he intended to appear at the bar without compulsion This defence which took up more than an hour was heard by the multitude that thro  ged the court with the most attentive and respectful silence Those who thought he ought not to be acquitted owned that applause could not be refused him and those who before pitied his misfortunes now reverenced his abilities  The witnesses who appeared against him were proved to be persons of such characters as did not entitle them to much credit a common strumpet a  woman by whom such wretches were entertained and a man by whom they were supported The character of Savage was by s  veral persons of distinction asserted to be that of a modest inoffensive man not inclined to broils or to insolence and who had to that time been only known by his misfortunes and his wit  Had his audience been his judges he had undoubtedly been acquitted but Mr Page who was then upon the bench treated him with the most brutal severity and in summing up the evidence endeavoured to exasperate the jury against him and misrepresent his defence This was a provocation and an insult which the prisoner could not bear and therefore Mr Savage resolutely asserted that his cause was not candidly explained and began to recapitulate what he had before said but the judge having ordered him to be silent which Savage treated with contempt he commanded that he should be taken by force from the bar The jury then heard the opinion of the judge that good characters were of no weight against positive evidence though they might turn the scale where it was doubtful and that though two men attack each other the death of either is only manslaughter but where one is the aggressor as in the case before them and in pursuance of his first attack kills the other the law supposes the action however sudden to be malicious The jury determined that Mr Savage and Mr Gregory were guilty of murder and Mr Marchant who had no sword only manslaughter  Mr Savage and Mr Gregory were conducted back to prison where they were more closely confined and loaded with irons of fifty pound weight Savage had now no hopes of life but from the king's mercy and can it be believed  that mercy his own mother endeavoured to intercept  When Savage as we have already observed was first made acquainted with the story of his birth he was so touched with tenderness for his mother that he earnestly sought an opportunity to see her  To prejudice the queen against him she made use of an incident which was omitted in the order of time that it might be mentioned together with the purpose it was made to serve  One evening while he was walking as was his custom in the street she inhabited he saw the door of her house by accident open he entered it and finding no persons in the passage to prevent him went up stairs to salute her She discovered him before he could enter her chamber alarmed the family with the most distressful outcries and when she had by her screams gathered them about her ordered them to drive out of the house that villain who had forced himself in upon her and endeavoured to murder her  This abominable falsehood his mother represented to the queen or communicated it to some who were base enough to relate it and so strongly prepossessed her majesty against this unhappy man that for a long while she rejected all petitions that were offered in his favour  Thus had Savage perished by the evidence of a bawd of a strumpet and of his mother had not justice and compassion procured him an advocate of a rank too great to be rejected unheard and of virtue too eminent to be heard without being  believed The story of his sufferings reached the ear of the countess of Hertford who engaged in his support with the tenderness and humanity peculiar to that amiable lady She demanded an audience of the queen and laid before her the whole series of his mother's cruelty exposed the improbability of her accusation of murder and pointed out all the circumstances of her unequall'd barbarity  The interposition of this lady was so successful that he was soon after admitted to bail and on the th of March pleaded the king's pardon  Lord Tyrconnel delivered a petition to his majesty in Savage's behalf And Mrs Oldfield sollicited Sir Robert Walpole on his account This jointinterest procured him his pardon    Mr Savage during his imprisonment his trial and the time in which he lay under sentence of death behaved with great fortitude and confirmed by his unshaken equality of mind the esteem of those who before admired him for his abilities Upon weighing all the circumstances relating to this unfortunate event it plainly appears that the greatest guilt could not be imputed to Savage His killing Sinclair was rather rash than totally dishonourable for though Marchant had been the aggressor who would not procure his friend from being overpowered by numbers  Some time after he had obtained his liberty he met in the street the woman of the town that had swore against him She informed him that she was in distress and with unparalleled assurance desired him to relieve her He instead of insulting her misery and taking pleasure in the calamity of one who had brought his life into danger reproved  her gently for her perjury and changing the only guinea he had divided it equally between her and himself  Compassion seems indeed to have been among the few good qualities possessed by Savage he never appeared inclined to take the advantage of weakness to attack the defenceless or to press upon the falling Whoever was distressed was certain at last of his good wishes But when his heart was not softened by the sight of misery he was obstinate in his resentment and did not quickly lose the remembrance of an injury He always harboured the sharpest resentment against judge Page and a short time before his death he gratified it in a satire upon that severe magistrate  When in conversation this unhappy subject was mentioned Savage appeared neither to consider himself as a murderer nor as a man wholly free from blood How much and how long he regretted it appeared in a poem published many years afterwards which the following lines will set in a very striking light  Is chance a guilt that my disast'rous heart  For mischief never meant must ever smart  Can selfdefence be sinAh plead no more  What tho' no purpos'd malice stain'd thee o'er  Had Heav'n befriended thy unhappy side  Thou had'st not been provok'd or thou had'st died  Far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all  On whom unsought imbroiling dangers fall  Still the pale dead revives and lives to me  To me through pity's eye condemn'd to see  Remembrance veils his rage but swells his fate  Griev'd I forgive and am grown cool too late  Young and unthoughtful then who knows one day  What rip'ning virtues might have made their way  He might perhaps his country's friend have prov'd  Been gen'rous happy candid and belov'd  He might have sav'd some worth now doom'd to fall  And I perchance in him have murder'd all  Savage had now obtained his liberty but was without any settled means of support and as he had lost all tenderness for his mother who had thirsted for his blood he resolved to lampoon her to extort that pension by satire which he knew she would never grant upon any principles of honour or humanity This expedient proved successful whether shame still survived though compassion was extinct or whether her relations had more delicacy than herself and imagined that some of the darts which satire might point at her would glance upon them Lord Tyrconnel whatever were his motives upon his promise to lay aside the design of exposing his mother received him into his family treated him as his equal and engaged to allow him a pension of l a year  This was the golden part of Mr Savage's life for some time he had no reason to complain of fortune his appearance was splendid his expences large and his acquaintance extensive  'He was courted says the author of his life by all who endeavoured to be thought men of genius and caressed by all that valued themselves upon a fine taste To admire Mr Savage was a proof of discernment and to be acquainted with him was a title to poetical reputation His presence was sufficient to make any place of entertainment popular  and his approbation and example constituted the fashion So powerful is genius when it is invested with the glitter of affluence Men willingly pay to fortune that regard which they owe to merit and are pleased when they have at once an opportunity of exercising their vanity and practising their duty This interval of prosperity furnished him with opportunities of enlarging his knowledge of human nature by contemplating life from its highest gradation to its lowest'  In this gay period of life when he was surrounded by the affluence of pleasure he published the Wanderer a Moral Poem of which the design is comprised in these lines  I fly all public care all venal strife  To try the  Still  compared with  Active Life  To prove by these the sons of men may owe  The fruits of bliss to bursting clouds of woe  That ev'n calamity by thought refin'd  Inspirits and adorns the thinking mind  And more distinctly in the following passage  By woe the soul to daring actions swells  By woe in plaintless patience it excells  From patience prudent clear experience springs  And traces knowledge through the course of things  Thence hope is form'd thence fortitude success  RenownWhate'er men covet or caress  This performance was always considered by Mr Savage as his masterpiece but Mr Pope when he asked his opinion of i  told him that he read it once over and was not displeased with it that it  gave him more pleasure at the second perusal and delighted him still more at the third From a poem so successfully written it might be reasonably expected that he should have gained considerable advantages but the case was otherwise he sold the copy only for ten guineas That he got so small a price for so finished a poem was not to be imputed either to the necessity of the writer or to the avarice of the bookseller He was a slave to his passions and being then in the pursuit of some trifling gratification for which he wanted a supply of money he sold his poem to the first bidder and perhaps for the first price which was proposed and probably would have been content with less if less had been offered It was addressed to the earl of Tyrconnel not only in the first lines but in a formal dedication filled with the highest strains of panegyric These praises in a short time he found himself inclined to retract being discarded by the man on whom he had bestowed them and whom he said he then discovered had not deserved them  Of this quarrel lord Tyrconnel and Mr Savage assigned very different reasons Lord Tyrconnel charged Savage with the most licentious behaviour introducing company into his house and practising with them the most irregular frolics and committing all the outrages of drunkenness Lord Tyrconnel farther alledged against Savage that the books of which he himself had made him a present were sold or pawned by him so that he had often the mortification to see them exposed to sale upon stalls  Savage it seems was so accustomed to live by expedients that affluence could not raise him above them He often went to the tavern and trusted the payment of his reckoning to the liberality of his company and frequently of company to whom he was very little known This conduct indeed seldom drew him into much inconvenience or his  versation and address were so pleasing that few thought the pleasure which they received from him dearly purchased by paying for his wine It was his peculiar happiness that he scarcely ever found a stranger whom he did not leave a friend but it must likewise be added that he had not often a friend long without obliging him to become an enemy  Mr Savage on the other hand declared that lord Tyrconnel quarrelled with him because he would not subtract from his own luxury and extravagance what he had promised to allow him and that his resentment was only a plea for the violation of his promise He asserted that he had done nothing which ought to exclude him from that subsistence which he thought not so much a favour as a debt since it was offered him upon conditions which he had never broken and that his only fault was that he could not be supported upon nothing  Savage's passions were strong among which his resentment was not the weakest and as gratitude was not his constant virtue we ought not too hastily to give credit to all his prejudice asserts against his once praised patron lord Tyrconnel  During his continuance with the lord Tyrconnel he wrote the Triumph of Health and Mirth on the recovery of the lady Tyrconnel from a languishing illness This poem is built upon a beautiful fiction Mirth overwhelmed with sickness for the death of a favourite takes a flight in quest of her sister Health whom she finds reclined upon the brow of a lofty mountain amidst the fragrance of a perpetual spring and the breezes of the morning sporting about her Being solicited by her sister Mirth she readily promises her assistance flies away in a cloud and impregnates the waters of Bath with new virtues by which the sickness of Belinda is relieved  While Mr Savage continued in high life he did not let slip any opportunity to examine whether the merit of the great is magnified or diminished by the medium through which it is contemplated and whether great men were selected for high stations or high stations made great men The result of his observations is not much to the advantage of those in power  But the golden aera of Savage's life was now at an end he was banished the table of lord Tyrconnel and turned again adrift upon the world While he was in prosperity he did not behave with a moderation likely to procure friends amongst his inferiors He took an opportunity in the sunshine of his fortune to revenge himself of those creatures who as they are the worshippers of power made court to him whom they had before contemptuously treated This assuming behaviour of Savage was not altogether unnatural He had been avoided and despised by those despicable sycophants who were proud of his acquaintance when raised to eminence In this case who would not spurn such mean Beings His degradation therefore from the condition which he had enjoyed with so much superiority was considered by many as an occasion of triumph Those who had courted him without success had an opportunity to return the contempt they had suffered  Mean time Savage was very diligent in exposing the faults of lord Tyrconnel over whom he obtained at least this advantage that he drove him first to the practice of outrage and violence for he was so much provoked by his wit and virulence that he came with a number of attendants to beat him at a coffeehouse but it happened that he had left the place a few minutes before Mr Savage went next day to repay his visit at his own house but was prevailed upon by his domestics to retire without insisting upon seeing him  He now thought himself again at full liberty to expose the cruelty of his mother and therefore about this time published THE BASTARD a Poem remarkable for the vivacity in the beginning where he makes a pompous enumeration of the imaginary advantages of base birth and the pathetic sentiments at the close where he recounts the real calamities which he suffered by the crime of his parents  The verses which have an immediate relation to those two circumstances we shall here insert  In gayer hours when high my fancy ran  The Muse exulting thus her lay began  Bless'd be the Bastard's birth thro' wond'rousways  He shines excentric like a comet's blaze  No sickly fruit of faint compliance he  He stamp'd in nature's mint with extasy  He lives to build not boast a gen'rous race  No tenth transmitter of a foolish face  His daring hope no fire's example bounds  His firstborn nights no prejudice confounds  He kindling from within requires no flame  He glories in a bastard's glowing name  Nature's unbounded son he stands alone  His heart unbiass'd and his mind his own  O mother yet no mother'Tis to you  My thanks for such distinguish'd claims are due  What had I lost if conjugally kind  By nature hating yet by vows confin'd  You had faint drawn me with a form alone  A lawful lump of life by force your own  I had been born your dull domestic heir  Load of your life and motive of your care  Perhaps been poorly rich and meanly great  The slave of pomp a cypher in the state  Lordly neglectful of a worth unknown  And slumb'ring in a seat by chance my own  After mentioning the death of Sinclair he goes on thus  Where shall my hope find restNo mother's care  Shielded my infant innocence with prayer  No father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd  Call'd forth my virtues and from vice restrain'd  This poem had extraordinary success great numbers were immediately dispersed and editions were multiplied with unusual rapidity  One circumstance attended the publication which Savage used to relate with great satisfaction His mother to whom the poem with due reverence was inscribed happened then to be at Bath where she could not conveniently retire from censure or conceal herself from observation and no sooner did the reputation of the poem begin to spread than she heard it repeated in all places of concourse nor could she enter the assemblyrooms or cross the walks without being saluted with some lines from the Bastard She therefore left Bath with the utmost haste to shelter herself in the crowds of London Thus Savage had the satisfaction of finding that tho' he could not reform he could yet punish his mother  Some time after Mr Savage took a resolution of applying to the queen that having once given him life she would enable him to support it and therefore published a short poem on her birth day to which he gave the odd title of VolunteerLaureat He had not at that time one friend to present his poem at court yet the Quee  notwithstanding this act of ceremony was  wanting in a few days after publication sent him a bank note of fiftypounds by lord North and Guildford and her permission to write annually on the same subject and that he should yearly receive the like present till something better should be done for him After this he was permitted to present one of his annual poems to her majesty and had the honour of kissing her hand  When the dispute between the bishop of London and the chancellor furnished for some time the chief topic of conversation Mr Savage who was an enemy to all claims of ecclesiastical power engaged with his usual zeal against the bishop In consequence of his aversion to the dominion of superstitious churchmen he wrote a poem called The Progress of a Divine in which he conducts a profligate priest thro' all the gradations of wickedness from a poor curacy in the country to the highest preferment in the church and after describing his behaviour in every station enumerates that this priest thus accomplished found at last a patron in the bishop of London  The clergy were universally provoked with this satire and Savage was censured in the weekly Miscellany with a severity he did not seem inclined to forget But a return of invective was not thought a sufficient punishment The court of King'sBench was moved against him and he was obliged to return an answer to a charge of obscenity It was urged in his defence that obscenity was only criminal when it was intended to promote the practice of vice but that Mr Savage had only introduced obscene ideas with a view of exposing them to detestation and of amending the age by shewing the deformity of wickedness This plea was admitted and Sir Philip York now lord Chancellor who then presided in that court dismissed the information  with encomiums upon the purity and excellence of Mr Savage's writings  He was still in his usual exigencies having no certain support but the pension allowed him from the Queen which was not sufficient to last him the fourth part of the year His conduct with regard to his pension was very particular No sooner had he changed the bill than he vanished from the sight of all his acquaintances and lay for some time out of the reach of his most intimate friends At length he appeared again pennyless as before but never informed any person where he had been nor was his retreat ever discovered This was his constant practice during the whole time he received his pension He regularly disappeared and returned He indeed affirmed that he retired to study and that the money supported him in solitude for many months but his friends declared that the short time in which it was spent sufficiently confuted his own account of his conduct  His perpetual indigence politeness and wit still raised him friends who were desirous to set him above want and therefore sollicited Sir Robert Walpole in his favour but though promises were given and Mr Savage trusted and was trusted yet these added but one mortification more to the many he had suffered His hopes of preferment from that statesman issued in a disappointment upon which he published a poem in the Gentleman's Magazine entitled The Poet's Dependance on a Statesman in which he complains of the severe usage he met with But to despair was no part of the character of Savage when one patronage failed he had recourse to another The Prince was now extremely popular and had very liberally rewarded the merit of some writers whom Mr Savage did not think superior to himself and therefore he resolved to address a poem to him  For this purpose he made choice of a subject which could regard only persons of the highest rank and greatest affluence and which was therefore proper for a poem intended to procure the patronage of a prince namely public spirit with regard to public works But having no friend upon whom he could prevail to present it to the Prince he had no other method of attracting his observation than by publishing frequent advertisements and therefore received no reward from his patron however generous upon other occasions His poverty still pressing he lodged as much by accident as he dined for he generally lived by chance eating only when he was invited to the tables of his acquaintance from which the meanness of his dress often excluded him when the politeness and variety of his conversation would have been thought a sufficient recompence for his entertainment Having no lodging he passed the night often in mean houses which are set open for any casual wanderers sometimes in cellars amongst the riot and filth of the meanest and most pro  igate of the rabble and sometimes when he was totally without money walked about the streets till he was weary and lay down in the summer upon a bulk and in the winter with his associates in poverty among the ashes of a glasshouse  In this manner were passed those days and nights which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated speculations On a bulk in a cellar or in a glasshouse among thieves and beggars was to be found the author of The Wanderer the man whose remarks in life might have assisted the statesman whose ideas of virtue might have enlightened the moralist whose eloquence might have influenced senates and whose delicacy might have polished courts His distresses however afflictive never dejected him In his lowest  sphere he wanted not spirit to assert the natural dignity of wit and was always ready to repress that insolence which superiority of fortune incited and to trample that reputation which rose upon any other basis than that of merit He never admitted any gross familiarity or submitted to be treated otherwise than as an equal  Once when he was without lodging meat or cloaths one of his friends a man indeed not remarkable for moderation in prosperity left a message that he desired to see him about nine in the morning Savage knew that his intention was to assist him but was very much disgusted that he should presume to prescribe the hour of his attendance and therefore rejected his kindness  The greatest hardships of poverty were to Savage not the want of lodging or of food but the neglect and contempt it drew upon him He complained that as his affairs grew desperate he found his reputation for capacity visibly decline that his opinion in questions of criticism was no longer regarded when his coat was out of fashion and that those who in the interval of his prosperity were always encouraging him to great undertakings by encomiums on his genius and assurances of success now received any mention of his designs with coldness and in short allowed him to be qualified for no other performance than volunteerlaureat Yet even this kind of contempt never depressed him for he always preserved a steady confidence in his own capacity and believed nothing above his reach which he should at any time earnestly endeavour to attain  This life unhappy as it may be already imagined was yet embittered in with new distresses The death of the Queen deprived him of all the prospects of preferment with which he had so long entertained his imagination But even against this calamity there was an expedient at  hand He had taken a resolution of writing a second tragedy upon the story of Sir Thomas Overbury in which he made a total alteration of the plan added new incidents and introduced new characters so that it was a new tragedy not a revival of the former With the profits of this scheme when finished he fed his imagination but proceeded slowly in it and probably only employed himself upon it when he could find no other amusement Upon the Queen's death it was expected of him that he should honour her memory with a funeral panegyric He was thought culpable for omitting it but on her birthday next year he gave a proof of the power of genius and judgment He knew that the track of elegy had been so long beaten that it was impossible to travel in it without treading the footsteps of those who had gone before him and therefore it was necessary that he might distinguish himself from the herd of encomists to find out some new walk of funeral panegyric  This difficult task he performed in such a manner that this poem may be justly ranked the best of his own and amongst the best pieces that the death of Princes has produced By transferring the mention of her death to her birthday he has formed a happy combination of topics which any other man would have thought it difficult to connect in one view but the relation between them appears natural and it may be justly said that what no other man could have thought on now s  ems scarcely possible for any man to miss In this poem when he takes occasion to mention the King he modestly gives him a hint to continue his pension which however he did not receive at the usual time and there was some reason to think that it would be discontinued He did not take those methods of retrieving his interest which were most likely to succeed for he went one day  to Sir Robert Walpole's levee and demanded the reason of the distinction that was made between him and the other pensioners of the Queen with a degree of roughness which perhaps determined him to withdraw what had only been delayed This last misfortune he bore not only with decency but cheerfulness nor was his gaiety clouded even by this disappointment though he was in a short time reduced to the lowest degree of distress and often wanted both lodging and food At this time he gave another instance of the insurmountable obstinacy of his spirit His cloaths were worn out and he received notice that at a coffeehouse some cloaths and linen were left for him The person who sent them did not we believe inform him to whom he was to be obliged that he might spare the perplexity of acknowledging the benefit but though the offer was so far generous it was made with some neglect of ceremonies which Mr Savage so much resented that he refused the present and declined to enter the house 'till the cloaths which were designed for him were taken away  His distress was now publicly known and his friends therefore thought it proper to concert some measures for his relief The scheme proposed was that he should retire into Wales and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year to be raised by subscription on which he was to live privately in a cheap place without aspiring any more to affluence or having any farther sollicitude for fame  This offer Mr Savage gladly accepted though with intentions very different from those of his friends for they proposed that he should continue an exile from London for ever and spend all the remaining part of his life at Swansea but he designed only to take the opportunity which their scheme offered him of retreating for a short time  that he might prepare his play for the stage and his other works for the press and then to return to London to exhibit his tragedy and live upon the profits of his own labour  After many sollicitations and delays a subscription was at last raised which did not amount to fifty pounds a year though twenty were paid by one gentleman He was however satisfied and willing to retire and was convinced that the allowance though scanty would be more than sufficient for him being now determined to commence a rigid oeconomist  Full of these salutary resolutions he quitted London in He was furnished with fifteen guineas and was told that they would be sufficient not only for the expence of his journey but for his support in Wales for some time and that there remained but little more of the first collection He promised a strict adherence to his maxims of parsimony and went away in the stage coach nor did his friends expect to hear from him 'till he informed them of his arrival at Swansea But when they least expected arrived a letter dated the th day after his departure in which he sent them word that he was yet upon the road and without money and that he therefore could not proceed without a remittance They then sent him the money that was in their hands with which he was enabled to reach Bristol from whence he was to go to Swansea by water At Bristol he found an embargo laid upon the shipping so that he could not immediately obtain a passage and being therefore obliged to stay there some time he with his usual felicity ingratiated himself with many of the principal inhabitants was invited to their houses distinguished at their public feasts and treated with a regard that gratified his vanity and therefore easily engaged his affection  After some stay at Bristol he retired to Swansea the place originally proposed for his residence where he lived about a year very much dissatisfied with the diminution of his salary for the greatest part of the contributors irritated by Mr Savage's letters which they imagined treated them co  temptuously withdrew their subscriptions At this place as in every other he contracted an acquaintance with those who were most distinguished in that country among whom he has celebrated Mr Powel and Mrs Jones by some verses inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine Here he compleated his tragedy of which two acts were wanting when he left London and was desirous of coming to town to bring it on the stage This design was very warmly opposed and he was advised by his chief benefactor who was no other than Mr Pope to put it in the hands of Mr Thomson and Mr Mallet that it might be fitted for the stage and to allow his friends to receive the profits out of which an annual pension should be paid him This proposal he rejected with the utmost contempt He was by no means convinced that the judgment of those to whom he was required to submit was superior to his own He was now determined as he expressed to be no longer kept in leadingstrings and had no elevated idea of his bounty who proposed to pension him out of the profits of his own labours He soon after this quitted Swansea and with an intent to return to London went to Bristol where a repetition of the kindness which he had formerly sound invited him to stay He was not only caressed and treated but had a collection made for him of about thirty pounds with which it bad been happy if he had immediately departed for London but he never considered that such proofs of kindness were not often to be expected and that this ardour of benevolence was in a great degree the effect of novelty  Another part of his misconduct was the practice of prolonging his visits to unseasonable hours and disconcerting all the families into which he was admitted This was an error in a place of commerce which all the charms of conversation could not compenfate for what trader would purchase such airy satisfaction with the loss of solid gain which must be the consequence of midhight merriment as those hours which were gained at night were generally lost in the morning Distress at last stole upon him by imperceptible degrees his conduct had aheady wearied some of those who were at first enamoured of his conversation but he still might have devolved to others whom he might have entertained with equal success had not the decay of his cloaths made it no longer consistent with decency to admit him to their tables or to associate with him in public places He now began to find every man from home at whose house he called and was therefore no longer able to procu  e the necessaries of life but wandered about the town slighted and neglected in quest of a dinner which he did not always obtain To compleat his mifery he was obliged to withdraw from the small number of friends from whom he had still reason to hope for favours His custom was to lie in bed the greatest part of the day and to go out in the dark with the utmost privacy and after having paid his visit return again before morning to his lodging which was in the garret of an obscure inn  Being thus excluded on one hand and confined on the other he suffered the utmost extremities of poverty and often fasted so long that he was seized with faintness and had lost his appetite not being able to bear the smell of meat 'till the action of his stomach was restored by a cordial  He continued to bear these severe pressures 'till the landlady of a coffeehouse to whom he owed about eight pounds compleated his wretchedness He was arrested by order of this woman and conducted to the house of a Sheriff's Officer where he remained some time at a great expence in hopes of finding bail This expence he was enabled to support by a present from Mr Nash of Bath who upon hearing of his late misfortune sent him five guineas No friends would contribute to release him from prison at the expence of eight pounds and therefore he was removed to Newgate He bore this misfortune with an unshaken fortitude and indeed the treatment he met with from Mr Dagg the keeper of the prison greatly softened the rigours of his confinement He was supported by him at his own table without any certainty of recompence had a room to himself to which he could at any time retire from all disturbance was allowed to stand at the door of the prison and sometimes taken out into the fields so that he suffered fewer hardships in the prison than he had been accustomed to undergo the greatest part of his life Virtue is undoubtedly most laudable in that state which makes it most difficult and therefore the humanity of the gaoler certainly deserves this public attestation  While Mr Savage was in prison he began and almost finished a satire which he entitled London and Bristol Delineated in order to be revenged of those who had had no more generosity for a man to whom they professed friendship than to suffer him to languish in a gaol for eight pounds He had now ceased from corresponding with any of his subscribers except Mr Pope who yetcontinued to remit him twenty pounds a year which he had promised and by whom he expected to be in a very short time enlarged because he had directed the keeper to enquire after the state of his debts  However he took care to enter his name according to the forms of the court that the creditors might be obliged to make him some allowance if he was continued a prisoner and when on that occasion he appeared in the Hall was treated with very unusual respect  But the resentment of the City was afterwards raised by some accounts that had been spread of the satire and he was informed that some of the Merchants intended to pay the allowance which the law required and to detain him a prisoner at their own expence This he treated as an empty menace and had he not been prevented by death he would have hastened the publication of the satire only to shew how much he was superior to their insults  When he had been six months in prison he received from Mr Pope in whose kindness he had the greatest confidence and on whose assistance he chiefly depended a letter that contained a charge of very atrocious ingratitude drawn up in such terms as sudden resentment dictated Mr Savage returned a very solemn protestation of his innocence but however appeared much disturbed at the accusation Some days afterwards he was seized with a pain in his back and side which as it was not violent was not suspected to be dangerous but growing daily more languid and dejected on the th of July he confined himself to his room and a fever seized his spirits The symptoms grew every day more formidable but his condition did not enable him to procure any assistance The last time the keeper saw him was on July when Savage seeing him at his bedside said with uncommon earnestness I have something to say to you sir but after a pause moved his hand in a melancholy manner and finding himself unable to recollect what he was going to communicate said 'tis gone The keeper soon after left him and  the next morning he died He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter at the expence of the keeper  Such were the life and death of this unfortunate poet a man equally distinguished by his virtues and vices and at once remarkable for his weaknesses and abilities He was of a middle stature of a thin habit of body a long visage coarse features and a melancholy aspect of a grave and manly deportment a solemn dignity of mien but which upon a nearer acquaintance softened into an engaging easiness of manners His walk was slow and his voice tremulous and mournful He was easily excited to smiles but very seldom provoked to laughter His judgment was eminently exact both with regard to writings and to men The knowledge of life was his chief attainment He was born rather to bear misfortunes greatly than to enjoy prosperity with moderation He discovered an amazing firmness of spirit in spurning those who presumed to dictate to him in the lowest circumstances of misery but we never can reconcile the idea of true greatness of mind with the perpetual inclination Savage discovered to live upon the bounty of his friends To struggle for independence appears much more landable as well as a higher instance of spirit than to be the pensioner of another  As Savage had seen so much of the world and was capable of so deep a penetration into nature it was strange he could not form some scheme of a livelihood more honourable than that of a poetical mendicaut his prosecuting any plan of life with disgence would have thrown more lustre on his character than all his works and have raised our ideas of the greatness of his splrit much beyond the conduct we have already seen If poverty is so great an evil as to expose a man to commit actions at which he afterwards blushes to avoid  this poverty should be the continual care of every man and he who lets slip every opportunity of doing so is more entitled to admiration than pity should he bear his sufferings nobly  Mr Savage's temper in consequence of the dominion of his passions was uncertain and capricious He was easily engaged and easily disgusted but he is accused of retaining his hatred more tenaciously than his benevolence He was compassionate bosh by nature and principle and always ready to perform offices of humanity but when he was provoked and very small offences were sufficient to provoke him he would prosecute his revenge with the utmost acrimony 'till his passion had subsided His friendship was therefore of little value for he was zealous in the support or vindication of those whom he loved yet it was always dangerous to trust him because he considered himself as discharged by the first quarrel from all ties of honour and gratitude He would even betray those secrets which in the warmth of confidence had been imparted to him His veracity was often questioned and not without reason When he loved any man he suppressed all his faults and when he had been offended by him concealed all his virtues But his characters were generally true so far as he proceeded though it cannot be denied but his partiality might have sometimes the effect of falshood  In the words of the celebrated writer of his life from whom as we observed in the beginning we have extracted the account here given we shall conclude this unfortunate person's Memoirs which were so various as to afford large scope for an able biographer and which by this gentleman have been represented with so great a mastery and force of penetration that the Life of Savage as written by him is an excellent model for this species of writing  'This relation says he will not be wholly without its use if those who languish under any part of his sufferings should be enabled to fortify their patience by reflecting that they feel only those afflictions from which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him or those who in confidence of superior capacities or attainments disregard the common maxims of life shall be reminded that nothing can supply the want of prudence and that negligence and irregularity long continued will make knowledge useless wit ridiculous and genius contemptible'  Dr THOMAS SHERIDAN  WAS born in the county of Cavan where his father kept a public house A gentleman who had a regard for his father and who observed the son gave early indications of genius above the common standard sent him to the college of Dublin and contributed towards the finishing his education there Our poet received very great encouragement upon his setting out in life and was esteemed a fortunate man The agreeable humour and the unreserved pleasantry of his temper introduced him to the acquaintance and established him in the esteem of the wits of that age He set up a school in Dublin which at one time was so considerable as to produce an income of a thousand pounds a year and possessed besides some good livings and bishops leases which are extremely lucrative  Mr Sheridan married the daughter of Mr Macpherson a Scots gentleman who served in the wars under King William and during the troubles of Ireland became possessed of a small estate of about l per annum called Quilca This little fortune devolved on Mrs Sheridan which enabled her husband to set up a school Dr Sheridan amongst his virtues could not number oeconomy on the contrary he was remarkable for profusion and extravagance which exposed him to such inconveniences that he was obliged to mortgage all he had His school daily declined and  by an act of indiscretion he was stript of the best living he then enjoyed On the birthday of his late Majesty the Dr having occasion to preach chose for his text the following words  Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  This procured him the name of a Jaeobite or a disaffected person a circumstance sufficient to ruin him in his ecclesiastical capacity His friends who were disposed to think favourably of him were for softning the epithet of Jacobite into Tory imputing his choice of that text rather to whim and humour than any settled projudice against his Majesty or the government but this unseasonable pleasantry was not so easily passed over and the Dr had frequent occasion to repent the choice of his text  Unhappy Sheridan he lived to want both money and friends He spent his money and time merrily among the gay and the great and was an example that there are too many who can relish a man's humour who have not so quick a sense of his misfortunes The following story should not have been told were it not true  In the midst of his misfortunes when the demands of his creditors obliged him to retirement he went to dean Swift and sollicited a lodging for a few days 'till by a proper composition he might be restored to his freedom The dean retired early to rest The Dr fatigued but not inclinable to go so soon to bed sent the servant to the dean desiring the key of the cellar that he might have a bottle of wine The dean in one of his odd humours returned for answer he promised to find him a lodging but not in wine and refused to send the key The Dr being thunderstruck at this unexpected incivility the tears burst from his eyes he quitted the  house and we believe never after repeared the visit  Dr Sheridan died in the year in the  th  year of his age The following epitaph for him was handed about  Beneath this marble stone here lies  Poor Tom more merry much than wife  Who only liv'd for two great ends  To spend his cash and lose his friends  His darling wife of him bereft  Is only griev'dthere's nothing left  When the account of his death was inserted in the papers it was done in the following particular terms  'September died the revd Dr Thomas Sheridan of Dublin He was a great linguist a most sincere friend a delightful companion and the best Schoolmaster in Europe He took the greatest care of the morals of the young gentlemen who had the happiness of being bred up under him and it was remarked that none of his scholars ever was an Atheist or a FreeThinker'  We cannot more successfully convey to the reader a true idea of Dr Sheridan than by the two following quotations from Lord Orrery in his life of Swift in which he occasionally mentions Swift's friend  'Swift was naturally fond of seeing his works in print and he was encouraged in this fondness by his friend Dr Sheridan who had the Cacoethes Scribendi to the greatest degree and was continually letting off squibs rockets and all sorts of little fireworks from the press by which means he offended many particular persons who although  they stood in awe of Swift held Shetidan at defiance The truth is the poor doctor by nature the most peacable inoffensive man alive was in a continual state of warfare with the Minor Poets and they revenged themselves or in the style of Mr Bays often gave him flash for flash and singed his feathers The affection between Theseus and Perithous was not greater than the affection between Swift and Sheridan But the friendship that cemented the two ancient heroes probably commenced upon motives very different from those which united the two modern divines'  'Dr Sheridan was a schoolmaster and in many instances perfectly well adapted for that station He was deeply vers'd in the Greek and Roman languages and in their customs and antiquities He had that kind of good nature which absence of mind indolence of body and carelessness of fortune produce And although not overstrict in his own conduct yet he took care of the morality of his scholars whom he sent to the university remarkably well founded in all kind of classical learning and not ill instructed in the social duties of life He was slovenly indigent and chearful He knew books much better than men And he knew the value of money least of all In this situation and with this disposition Swift fastened upon him as upon a prey with which he intended to regale himself whenever his appetite should prompt him Sheridan was therefore certainly within his reach and the only time he was permitted to go beyond the limits of his chain was to take possession of a living in the county of Corke which had been bestowed upon him by the then lord lieutenant of Ireland the present earl of Granville Sheridan in one fatal moment or by one fatal text effected his own ruin  You will find the story told by Swift himself in the fourth volume of his works page in a pamphlet intitled a Vindication of his Excessency John Lord Carteret from the charge of favouring none but Tories HighChurchmen and Jacobites So that here I need only tell you that this ilstarred goodnatur'd improvident man returned to Dublin unhinged from all favour at court and even banished

Millar  One of the volumes of Swift's Miscellanies consists almost entirely of Letters between the Dean and the Dr  The Revd Dr JONATHAN SWIFT  WHEN the life of a person whose wit and genius raised him to an eminence among writers of the first class is written by one of uncommon abilitiesOne possess'd of the power as Shakespear says  of looking quite thro' the deeds of men  we are furnished with one of the highest entertainments a man can enjoySuch an author also presents us with a true picture of human nature which affords us the most ample instructionHe discerns the passions which play about the heart and while he is astonished with the high efforts of genius is at the same time enabled to observe nature as it really is and how distant from perfection mankind are in this world even in the most refined state of humanity Such an intellectual feast they enjoy who peruse the life of this great author drawn by the masterly and impartial hand of lord Orrery We there discern the greatness and weakness of Dean Swift we discover the patriot the genius and the humourist the peevish master the ambitious statesman the implacable enemy and the warm friend His mixed qualities and imperfections are there candidly marked His errors and virtues are so strongly represente  that while we reflect upon his virtues we forget he had so many failings and when we consider his errors we are disposed to think he had fewer virtues With such candour and impartiality has lord Orrery drawn the portrait of Swift and as every biographer  ought to do has shewn us the man as he really was  Upon this account given by his lordship is the following chiefly built It shall be our business to take notice of the most remarkable passages of the life of Swift to omit no incidents that can be found concerning him and as our propos'd bounds will not suffer us to enlarge we shall endeavour to display with as much conciseness as possible those particulars which may be most entertaining to the reader  He was born in Dublin November the th and was carried into England soon after his birth by his nurse who being obliged to cross the sea and having a nurse's fondness for the child at her breast convey'd him a shipboard without the knowledge of his mother or relations and kept him with her at Whitehaven in Cumberland during her residence about threeyears in that place This extraordinary event made his return seem as if he had been transplanted to Ireland rather than that he owed his original existence to that soil But perhaps he tacitly hoped to inspire different nations with a contention for his birth at least in his angry moods when he was peevish and provoked at the ingratitude of Ireland he was frequently heard to say  'I am not of this vile country I am an Englishman'  Such an assertion tho' meant figuratively was often received literally and the report was still farther propagated by Mr Pope who in one of his letters has this expression  'Tho' one or two of our friends are gone since you saw your native country there remain a few'  But doctor Swift in his cooler hours never denied his country On the contrary he frequently mentioned and pointed out the house where he was born  The other suggestion concerning the illegitimacy of his birth is equally false Sir William Temple was employed as a minister abroad from the year  to the year first at Brussels and afterwards at the Hague as appears by his correspondence with the earl of Arlington and other ministers of state So that Dr Swift's mother who never crossed the sea except from England to Ireland was out of all possibility of a personal correspondence with Sir William Temple till some years after her son's birth Dr Swift's ancestors were persons of decent and reputable characters His grandfather was the Revd Mr Thomas Swift vicar of Goodridge near Ross in Herefordshire He enjoyed a paternal estate in that county which is still in possession of his greatgrandson Dean Swift  Esq  He died in the year leaving five sons Godwin Thomas Dryden Jonathan and Adam  Two of them only Godwin and Jonathan left sons Jonathan married Mrs Abigail Erick of Leicestershire by whom he had one daughter and a son The daughter was born in the first year of Mr Swift's marriage but he lived not to see the birth of his son who was born two months after his death and became afterwards the famous Dean of St Patrick's  The greatest part of Mr Jonathan Swift's income had depended upon agencies and other employments of that kind so that most of his fortune perished with him  Lord Orrery page  and the remainder being the only support that his widow could enjoy the care tuition and expence of her two children devolved upon her husband's elder brother Mr Godwin Swift who voluntarily became their guardian and supplied the loss which they had sustained in a father  The faculties of the mind appear and shine forth at different ages in different men The infancy of Dr Swift pass'd on without any marks of distinction At  six years old he was sent to school at Kilkenny and about eight years afterwards he was entered a student of TrinityCollege in Dublin He lived there in perfect regularity and under an entire obedience to the statutes but the moroseness of his temper rendered him very unacceptable to his companions so that he was little regarded and less beloved nor were the academical exercises agreeable to his genius He held logic and metaphysics in the utmost contempt and he scarce considered mathematics and natural philosophy unless to turn them into ridicule The studies which he followed were history and poetry In these he made a great progress but to all other branches of science he had given so very little application that when he appeared as a candidate for the degree of batchelor of arts he was set aside on account of insufficiency  'This says lord Orrery is a surprising incident in his life but it is undoubtedly true and even at last he obtained his admission Speciali Gratiâ A phrase which in that university carries with it the utmost marks of reproach It is a kind of dishonourable degree and the record of it notwithstanding Swift's present established character throughout the learned world must for ever remain against him in the academical register at Dublin'  The more early disappointments happen in life the deeper impression they make upon the heart Swift was full of indignation at the treatment he received in Dublin and therefore resolved to pursue his studies at Oxford However that he might be admitted Ad Eundem he was obliged to carry with him the testimonium of his degree The expression Speciali Gratiâ is so peculiar to the university of Dublin that when Mr Swift exhibited  his testimonium at Oxford the members of the English university concluded that the words Speciali Gratiâ must signity a degree conferred in reward of extraordinary diligence and learning It as natural to imagine that he did not try to undeceive them he was entered in HartHall now HartfordCollege where he resided till he took his degree of master of arts in the year  Dr Swift's uncle on whom he had placed his chief dependance dying in the Revolution year he was supported chiefly by the bounty of Sir William Temple to whose lady he was a distant relation Acts of generosity seldom meet with their just applause Sir William Temple's friendship was immediately construed to proceed from a consciousness that he was the real father of Mr Swift otherwise it was thought impossible he could be so uncommonly munificent to a young man so distantly related to his wife  'I am not quite certain says his noble Biographer that Swift himself did not acquiesce in the calumny perhaps like Alexander he thought the natural son of Jupiter would appear greater than the legitimate son of Philip'  As soon as Swift quitted the university he lived with Sir William Temple as his friend and domestic companion When he had been about two years in the family of his patron he contracted a very long and dangerous illness by eating an immoderate quantity of fruit To this surfeit he used to ascribe the giddiness in his head which with intermissions sometimes of a longer and sometimes of a shorter continuance pursued him till it seemed to compleat its conquest by rendering him the exact image of one of his own STRULDBRUGGS a miserable spectacle devoid of every appearance of human nature except the outward form  After Swift had sufficiently recovered to travel he went into Ireland to try the effects of his native air and he found so much benefit by the journey that pursuant to his own inclinations he soon returned into England and was again most affectionately received by Sir William Temple whose house was now at Sheen where he was often visited by King William Here Swift had frequent opportunities of conversing with that prince in some of which conversations the king offered to make him a captain of horse An offer which in his splenetic dispositions he always seemed sorry to have refused but at that time he had resolved within his own mind to take orders and during his whole life his resolutions like the decrees of fate were immoveable Thus determined he again went over to Ireland and immediately inlisted himself under the banner of the church He was recommended to lord Capel then LordDeputy who gave him the first vacancy a prebend of which the income was about a hundred pounds a year  Swift soon grew weary of a preferment which to a man of his ambition was far from being sufficiently considerable He resigned his prebend in favour of a friend and being sick of solitude he returned to Sheen were he lived domestically as usual till the death of Sir William Temple who besides a legacy in money left to him the care and trust of publishing his posthumous works  During Swift's residence with Sir William Temple he became intimately acquainted with a lady whom he has distinguished and often celebrated under the name of Stella The real name of this lady was Johnson She was the daughter of Sir William Temple's steward and the concealed but undoubted wife of doctor Swift Sir William Temple bequeathed her in his will l as an acknowledgment of her father's faithful services In the year she was married to doctor Swift by doctor Ashe then bishop of Clogher  The reader must observe there was a long interval between the commencement of his acquaintance with Stella and the time of making her his wife for which as it appears he was fond of her from the beginning of their intimacy no other cause can be assigned but that the same unaccountable humour which had so long detained him from marrying prevented him from acknowledging her after she was his wife  'Stella says lord Orrery was a most amiable woman both in mind and person She had an elevated understanding with all the delicacy and softness of her own sex Her voice however sweet in itself was still rendered more harmonious by what she said Her wit was poignant without severity Her manners were humane polite easy and unreservedWherever she came she attracted attention and esteem As virtue was her guide in morality sincerity was her guide in religion She was constant but not ostentatious in her devotions She was remarkably prudent in her conversation She had great skill in music and was perfectly well versed in all the lesser arts that employ a lady's leisure Her wit allowed her a fund of perpetual chearfulness within proper limits She exactly answered the description of Penelope in Homer  ' A woman loveliest of the lovely kind  ' In body perfect and compleat in mind'  Such was this amiable lady yet with all these advantages she could never prevail on Dr Swift to acknowledge her openly as his wife A great genius must tread in unbeaten paths and deviate from the common road of life otherwise a diamond of so much luster might have been publickly produced although it had been fixed within the collet of matrimony  But that which diminished the value of this inestimable jewel in Swift's eye was the servile state of her father  Ambition and pride the predominant principles which directed all the actions of Swift conquered reason and justice and the vanity of boasting such a wi  e was suppressed by the greater vanity of keeping free from a low alliance Dr Swift and Mrs Johnson continued the same oeconomy of life after marriage which they had pursued before it They lived in separate houses nothing appeared in their behaviour inconsistent in their decorum and beyond the limits of platonic love However unaccountable this renunciation of marriage rites might appear to the world it certainly arose not from any consciousness of a too near consanguinity between him and Mrs Johnson although the general voice of some was willing to make them both the natural children of Sir William Temple Dr Swift says lord Orrery was not of that opinion for the same false pride which induced him to deny the legitimate daughter of an obscure servant might have prompted him to own the natural daughter of Sir William Temple  The authors of the Monthly Review have justly remarked that this observation of his lordship's seems premature  'The same public rumour say they that made HER Sir William Temple's daughter made HIM also Sir William's son Therefore he Swift could never with decency have acknowledged Mrs Johnson as his wife while that rumour continued to retain any degree of credit and if there had been really no foundation for it surely it might have been no very hard task to obviate its force by producing the necessary proofs and circumstances of his birth Yet we do not find that ever this was done either by the Dean or his relations'    It is natural to imagine that a woman of Stella's delicacy must repine at such an extraordinary situation The outward honours she received are as frequently bestowed upon a mistress as a wife she  was absolutely virtuous and was yet obliged to submit to all the appearances of vice Inward anxiety affected by degrees the calmness of her mind and the strength of her body She died towards the end of January absolutely destroy'd by the peculiarity of her fate a fate which perhaps she could not have incurred by an alliances with any other person in the world  Upon the death of Sir William Temple Swift came to London and took the earliest opportunity of delivering a petition to King William under the claim of a promise made by his majesty to Sir William Temple that Mr Swift should have the first vacancy which might happen among the prebends of Westminster or Canterbury But this promise was either totally forgotten or the petition which Mr Swift presented was drowned amidst the clamour of more urgent addresses From this first disappointment may be dated that bitterness towards kings and courtiers which is to be found so universally dispersed throughout his works  After a long and fruitless attendance at Whitehall Swift reluctantly gave up all thoughts of a settlement in England Pride prevented him from remaining longer in a state of servility and contempt He complied therefore with an invitation from the earl of Berkley appointed one of the Lords Justices in Ireland to attend him as his chaplain and private secretaryLord Berkley landed near Waterford and Mr Swift acted as secretary during the whole journey to Dublin But another of lord Berkley's attendants whose name was Bush had by this time insinuated himself into the earl's favour and had whispered to his lordship that the post of secretary was not proper for a clergyman to whom only church preferments could be suitable or advantageous Lord Berkley listened perhaps too attentively to these insinuations and making some slight apology  to Mr Swift divested him of that office and bestowed it upon Mr Bush  Here again was another disappointment and a fresh object of indignation The treatment was thought injurious and Swift expressed his sensibility of it in a short but satyrical copy of verses intitled the Discovery However during the government of the Earls of Berkley and Galway who were jointly Lords Justices of Ireland two livings Laracor and Rathbeggan were given to Mr Swift The first of these rectories was worth about and the latter about l a year and they were the only church preferments which he enjoyed till he was appointed Dean of St Patrick's in the year  Lord Orrery gives the following instances of his humour and of his pride  As soon as he had taken possession of his two livings he went to reside at Laracor and gave public notice to his parishioners that he would read prayers on every Wednesday and Friday Upon the subsequent Wednesday the bell was rung and the rector attended in his desk when after having sat some time and finding the congregation to consist only of himself and his clerk Roger he began with great composure and gravity but with a turn peculiar to himself  "  Dearly beloved  Roger  the scripture moveth you and me in sundry places c  "  And then proceeded regularly thro' the whole service This trifling circumstance serves to shew that he could not resist a vein of humour whenever he had an opportunity of exerting it  The following is the instance of his pride While Swift was chaplain to lord Berkley his only sister by the consent and approbation of her uncle and relations was married to a man in trade whose fortune character and situation were esteemed by all her friends and suitable to her in every respect  But the marriage was intirely disagreeable to her brother It seemed to interrupt those ambitious views he had long since formed He grew outragious at the thoughts of being brotherin law to a tradesman He utterly refused all reconciliation with his sister nor would he even listen to the entreaties of his mother who came over to Ireland under the strongest hopes of pacifying his anger having in every other instance found him a dutiful and obedient son But his pride was not to be conquered and Mrs Swift finding her son inflexible hastened back to Leicester where she continued till her death  During his mother's life time he scarce ever failed to pay her an annual visit But his manner of travelling was as singular as any other of his actions He often went in a waggon but more frequently walked from Holyhead to Leicester London or any other part of England He generally chose to dine with waggoners ostlers and persons of that rank and he used to lye at night in houses where he found written over the door Lodgings for a Penny He delighted in scenes of low life The vulgar dialect was not only a fund of humour for him but seems to have been acceptable to his nature as appears from the many filthy ideas and indecent expressions found throughout his works  A strict residence in a country place was not in the least suitable to the restless temper of Swift He was perpetually making excursions not only to Dublin and other places in Ireland but likewise to London so rambling a disposition occasioned to him a considerable loss The rich deanery of Derry became vacant at this time and was intended for him by lord Berkley if Dr King then bishop of Derry and afterwards archbishop of Dublin had not interposed entreating with great earnestness that the deanery might be given to some grave and elderly divine rather than to so young a man  'because added the bishop the situation of Derry is in the midst of Presbyterians and I should be glad of a clergyman who might be of assistance to me I have no objection to Mr Swift I know him to be a sprightly ingenious young man but instead of residing I dare say he will be eternally flying backwards and forwards to London and therefore I entreat that he may be provided for in some other place'  Swift was accordingly set aside on account of youth and from the year to the change of the ministry in the year few circumstances of his life can be found sufficiently material to be inserted here From this last period 'till the death of Queen Anne we find him fighting on the side of the Tories and maintaining their cause in pamphlets poems and weekly papers In one of his letters to Mr Pope he has this expression  'I have conversed in some freedom with more ministers of state of all parties than usually happens to men of my level and I confess in their capacity as ministers I look upon them as a race of people whose acquaintance no man would court otherwise than on the score of vanity and ambition'  A man always appears of more consequence to himself than he is in reality to any other person Such perhaps was the case of Dr Swift He knew how useful he was to the administration in general and in one of his letters he mentions that the place of historiographer was intended for him but in this particular he flattered himself at least he remained without any preferment 'till the year when he was made dean of St Patrick's In point of power and revenue such a deanery might be esteemed no inconsiderable promotion but to an ambitious mind whose perpetual view was a settlement in England a dignity in any other country must appear only a  profitable and an honourable kind of banishment It is very probable that the temper of Swift might occasion his English friends to wish him promoted at a distance His spirit was ever untractable The motions of his genius were often irregular He assumed more of the air of a patron than of a friend He affected rather to dictate than advise He was elated with the appearance of enjoying ministerial confidence He enjoyed the shadow indeed but the substance was detained from him He was employed not entrusted and at the same time he imagined himself a subtle diver who dextrously shot down into the profoundest regions of politics he was suffered only to sound the shallows nearest the shore and was scarce admitted to descend below the froth at the top Swift was one of those strange kind of Tories who lord Bolingbroke in his letter to Sir William Wyndham calls the Whimsicals that is they were Tories attach'd to the Hanoverian succession This kind of Tory is so incongruous a creature that it is a wonder ever such a one existed Mrs Pilkington informs us that Swift had written A Defence of the last Ministers of Queen Anne from an intention of restoring the Pretender which Mr Pope advised him to destroy as not one word of it was true Bolingbroke by far the most accomplished man in that ministry for Oxford was in comparison of him a statesman of no compass certainly aimed at the restoration of the exiled family however he might disguise to some people his real intentions under the masque of being a Hanoverian Tory This serves to corroberate the observation which lord Orrery makes of Swift  'that he was employed not trusted c'  By reflexions of this sort says lord Orrery we may account for his disappointment of an English bishopric A disappointment which be imagined he owed to a joint application made against him  to the Queen by Dr Sharp archbishop of York and by a lady of the highest rank and character Archbishop Sharpe according to Swift's account had represented him to the Queen as a person who was no Christian the great lady had supported the assertion and the Queen upon such assurances had given away the bishopric contrary to her Majesty's intentions Swift kept himself indeed within some tolerable bounds when he spoke of the Queen but his indignation knew no limits when he mentioned the archbishop or the lady  Most people are fond of a settlement in their native country but Swift had not much reason to rejoice in the land where his lot had fallen for upon his arrival in Ireland to take possession of the deanery he found the violence of party raging in that kingdom to the highest degree The common people were taught to consider him as a Jacobite and they proceeded so far in their detestation as to throw stones and dirt at him as he passed thro' the streets The chapter of St Patrick's like the rest of the kingdom received him with great reluctance They opposed him in every point he proposed They avoided him as a pestilence and resisted him as an invader and an enemy to his country Such was his first reception as dean of St Patrick's Fewer talents and less firmness must have yielded to so outrageous an opposition He had seen enough of human nature to be convinced that the passions of low selfinterested minds ebb and flow continually They love they know not whom they hate they know not why They are captivated by words guided by names and governed by accidents But to shew the strange revolutions in this world Dr Swift who was now the detestation of the Irish rabble lived to be afterwards the most absolute monarch over them that ever governed men His first step was to reduce to reason and obedience his revd brethren  the chapter of St Patrick's in which he succeeded so perfectly and so speedily that in a short time after his arrival not one member in that body offered to contradict him even in trifles on the contrary they held him in the highest respect and veneration so that he sat in the ChapterHouse like Jupiter in the Synod of the Gods  In the beginning of the year Swift returned to England He found his great friends who sat in the seat of power much disunited among themselves He saw the Queen declining in her health and distressed in her situation while faction was exerting itself and gathering new strength every day He exerted the utmost of his skill to unite the ministers and to cement the apertures of the state but he found his pains fruitless his arguments unavailing and his endeavours like the stone of Sisyphus rolling back upon himself He retired to a friend's house in Berkshire where he remained 'till the Queen died So fatal an event terminated all his views in England and made him return as fast as possible to his deanery in Ireland oppressed with grief and discontent His hopes in England were now crushed for ever As Swift was well known to have been attached to the Queen's last ministry he met with several indignities from the populace and indeed was equally abused by persons of all ranks and denominations Such a treatment soured his temper confined his acquaintance and added bitterness to his stile  From the year 'till he appeared in the year a champion for Ireland against Wood's halfpence his spirit of politics and patriotism was kept almost closely confined within his own breast Idleness and trifles engrossed too many of his leisure hours fools and sycophants too much of his conversation His attendance upon the public service of the church was regular and uninterrupted  and indeed regularity was peculiar to all his actions even in the meerest trifles His hours of walking and reading never varied His motions were guided by his watch which was so constantly held in his hand or placed before him on the table that he seldom deviated many minutes in the revolution of his exercises and employments In the year he began to reassume in some degree the character of a political writer A small pamphlet in defence of the Irish Manufactures was his first essay in Ireland in that kind of writing and to that pamphlet he owed the turn of the popular tide in his favour It was entitled A Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture in Clothes and Furniture of Houses c utterly rejecting and renouncing every thing wearable that comes from England This proposal immediately raised a very violent flame The Printer was prosecuted and the prosecution had the same effect which generally attends those kind of measures It added fuel to flame But his greatest enemies must confess that the pamphlet is written in the stile of a man who had the good of his country nearest his heart who saw her errors and wished to correct them who felt her oppressions and wished to relieve them and who had a desire to rouze and awaken an indolent nation from a lethargic disposition that might prove fatal to her constitution This temporary opposition but increased the stream of his popularity He was now looked upon in a new light and was distinguished by the title of THE DEAN and so high a degree of popularity did he attain as to become an arbitrator in disputes of property amongst his neighbours nor did any man dare to appeal from his opinion or murmur at his decrees  But the popular effection which the dean had hitherto acquired may be said not to have been universal 'till the publication of the Drapier's  Letters which made all ranks and all professions unanimous in his applause The occasion of those letters was a scarcity of copper coin in Ireland to so great a degree that for some time past the chief manufacturers throughout the kingdom were obliged to pay their workmen in pieces of ti  or in other tokens of suppositious value Such a method was very disadvantageous to the lower parts of traffic and was in general an impediment to the commerce of the state To remedy this evil the late King granted a patent to one Wood to coin during the term of fourteen years farthings and halfpence in England for the use of Ireland to the value of a certain sum specified These halfpence and farthings were to be received by those persons who would voluntarily accept them But the patent was thought to be of such dangerous consequence to the public and of such exorbitant advantage to the patentee that the dean under the character of M B Drapier wrot  a Letter to the People warning them not to accept Wood's halfpence and farthings as current coin This first letter was succeeded by several others to the same purpose all which are inserted in his works  At the sound of the Drapier's trumpet a spirit arose among the people Persons of all ranks parties and denominations were convinced that the admission of Wood's copper must prove fatal to the commonwealth The Papist the Fanatic the Tory the Whig all listed themselves volunteers under the banner of the Drapier and were all equally zealous to serve the common cause Much heat and many fiery speeches against the administration were the consequence of this union nor had the flames been allayed notwithstanding threats and proclamations had not the coin been totally suppressed and Wood withdrawn his patent The name of Augustus was not bestowed upon  Octavius Caesar with more universal approbation than the name of the Drapier was bestowed upon the dean He had no sooner assumed his new cognomen than he became the idol of the people of Ireland to a degree of devotion that in the most superstitious country scarce any idol ever obtained Libations to his health were poured out as frequent as to the immortal memory of King William His effigies was painted in every street in Dublin Acclamations and vows for his prosperity attended his footsteps wherever he passed He was consulted in all points relating to domestic policy in general and to the trade of Ireland in particular but he was more immediately looked upon as the legislator of the Weavers who frequently came in a body consisting of or chiefs of their trade to receive his advice in settling the rates of their manufactures and the wages of their journeymen He received their address with less majesty than sternness and ranging his subjects in a circle round his parlour spoke as copiously and with as little difficulty and hesitation to the several points in which they supplicated his assistance as if trade had been the only study and employment of his life When elections were depending for the city of Dublin many Corporations refused to declare themselves 'till they had consulted his sentiments and inclinations which were punctually followed with equal chearfulness and submission  In this state of power and popular admiration he remained 'till he lost his senses a loss which he seemed to foresee and prophetically lamented to many of his friends The total deprivation of his senses came upon him by degrees In the year he was seized with a violent fit of giddiness he was at that time writing a satirical poem called The Legion Club but he found the effects of his giddiness so dreadful that he left the poem unfinished and never afterwards attempted a composition  either in verse or prose However his conversation still remained the same lively and severe but his memory gradually grew worse and worse and as that decrea  ed he grew every day more sretful and impatient In the year his friends found his passions so violent and ungover  able his memory so decayed and his reason so depraved that they took the utmost precautions to keep all strangers from approaching him for 'till then he had not appeared totally incapable of conversation But early in the year the small remains of his understanding became entirely confused and the violence of his rage increased absolutely to a degree of madness In this miserable state he seemed to be appointed the first inhabitant of his own Hospital especially as from an outrageous lunatic he sunk afterwards to a quiet speechless ideot and dragged out the remainder of his life in that helpless situation He died towards the latter end of October The manner of his death was easy without the least pang or convulsion even the rattling of his throat was scarce sufficient to give an alarm to his attendants 'till within some very little time before he expired A man in possession of his reason would have wished for such a kind dissolution but Swift was totally insensible of happiness or pain He had not even the power or expression of a child appearing for some years before his death reserved only as an example to mortify human pride and to reverse that fine description of human nature which is given us by the inimitable Shakespear  'What a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a God the beauty of the world the paragon of animals'  Swift's friends often heard him lament the state of childhood and idiotism to which some of the greatest  men of this nation were reduced before their death He mentioned as examples within his own time the duke of Marlborough and lord Somers and when he cited these melancholy instances it was always with a heavy sigh and with gestures that shewed great uneasiness as if he felt an impulse of what was to happen to him before he died He left behind him about twelve thousand pounds inclusive of the specific legacies mentioned in his will and which may be computed at the sum of twelve hundred pounds so that the remaining ten thousand eight hundred pounds is entirely applicable t  the Hospital for Idiots and Lunatics an establishment remarkably generous as those who receive the benefit must for ever remain ignorant of their benefactor  Lord O  erry has observed that a propension to jocularity and humour is apparent in the last works of Swift His Will like all his other writings is drawn up in his own peculiar manner Even in so serious a composition he cannot help indulging himself in leaving legacies that carry with them an air of raillery and jest He disposes of his three best hats his best his second best and his third best beaver with an ironical solemnity that renders the bequests ridiculous He bequeaths  'To Mr John Grattan a silverbox to keep in it the tobacco which the said John usually chewed called pigtail'  But his legacy to Mr Robert Grattan is still more extraordinary  'Item I bequeath to the Revd Mr Robert Grattan Prebendary of St Audeon's my strong box on condition of his giving the sole use of the said box to his brother Dr James Grattan during the life of the said Doctor who hath more occasion for it'  These are so many last expressions of his turn and way of thinking and no doubt the persons thus distinguished looked upon these instances as affectionate memorials of his friendship and tokens of the  jocose manner in which he had treated them during his lifetime  With regard to Dean Swift's poetical character the reader will take the following sketch of it in the words of Lord Orrery  'The poetical performances of Swift says he ought to be considered as occasional poems written either to pleasure  We are assured there was one while a misunderstanding subsisting between Swift and Pope But that worthy gentleman the late general Dormer who had a great regard for both reconciled them e'er it came to an open ruptureThough the world might be deprived by the general's mediation of great matter of entertainment which the whetted wit of two such men might have afforded yet his goodnature and sincere friendship deserves to be remember'd with honourThis gentleman Mr Cibber senior was very intimate with and once hinted to him  'He was concerned to find he stood so  in the Dean's opinion whose great parts wit genius c he held in the highest estimation nor could he easily account for the Dean's so frequently appearing his enemy as he never knowingly had offended him and regretted the want of an opportunity of being better acquainted with him'  The general had also a great regard for Mr Cibber and wished to bring them together on an agreeable footingWhy they were not so came out soon afterThe secret wasMr Pope was angry for the longlatent cause look into Mr Cibber's letter to Mr Pope Passion and prejudice are not always friends to truthand the soam of resentment never rose higher than when it boil'd and swell'd in Mr Pope's bosom No wonder then that his misrepresentation might make the Dean believe Mr Cibber was not unworthy of that satire and raillery not always just neither and sometimes solicited which is not  nsparingly thrown on him in the Dean's worksThat this was the case appears from the following circumstance  As soon as Mr Cibber's Apology was first printed it was immediately carried over to Dublin and given to Mr Faulkner an eminent printer and bookseller there by a gentleman who wished to see an edition of it in Ireland Mr Faulkner published it and the success thereof was so great some thousands thereof were disposed of in a very short time Just before the intended edition appeared the Dean who often visited Mr Faulkner coming into the shop asked  'What new pieces were likely to come forth'  Mr Faulkner gave Mr Cibber's Apology to himThe Dean's curosity was pretty strong to see a work of that uncommon sortIn short he stay'd and dined there and did not quit the house or the book 'till he had read it through He advised Faulkner to lose no time in printing it and said he would answer for it's successHe declared he had not perus'd any thing a long time that had pleas'd him so much and dwelt long in commendation of it He added that he almost envy'd the author the pleasure he must have in writing itThat he was sorry he had ever said any thing to his disadvantage and was convinced Cibber had been very much misrepresented to him nor did he scruple to say that as it had been formerly the fashion to abuse Cibber he had unwarily been drawn into it by Pope and others He often afterwards spoke in praise of Mr Cibber and his writings in general and of this work in particularHe afterwards told Mr Faulkner he had read Cibber's Apology thro' three times that he was more and more pleased with it That the style was not inferior to any English he had ever read That his words were properly adapted His similes happy uncommon and well chosen He then in a pleasant manner said  'You must give me this book which is the first thing I ever begg'd from you'  To this we may be sure Mr Faulkner readily consented Ever after in company the Dean gave this book a great characterLet the reader make the application of this true and well known fact    or to vex some particular persons We must not suppose them designed for posterity if he had cultivated his genius that way he must certainly have excelled especially in satire We see fine sketches in several of his pieces but he seems more desirous to inform and strengthen his mind than to indulge the luxuriancy of his imagination He chuses to discover and correct errors in the works of others rather than to illustrate and add beauties of his own Like a skilful artist he is fond of probing wounds to their depth and of enlarging them to open view He aims to be severely useful rather than politely engaging and as he was either not formed nor would take pains to excel in poetry he became in some measure superior to it and assumed more the air  and manner of a critic than a poet'  Thus far his lordship in his VIth letter but in his IXth he adds when speaking of the Second Volume of Swift's Works  'He had the nicest ear he is remarkably chaste and delicate in his rhimes A bad rhime appeared to him one of the capital sins of poetry'  The Dean's poem on his celebrated Vanessa is number'd among the best of his poetical pieces Of this lady it will be proper to give some account as she was a character as singular as Swift himself  Vanessa's real name was Esther Vanhomrich  The name is pronounced Vannumery  She was one of the daughters of Bartholomew Vanhomrich a Dutch merchant of Amsterdam who upon the Revolution went into Ireland and was appointed by king William a commissioner of the revenue The Dutch merchant by parsimony and prudence had collected a fortune of about l He bequeathed an equal division of it to his wife and his four children of which two were sons and two were daughters The sons after the death of their father travelled abroad The eldest died beyond sea and the youngest surviving his brother only a short time the whole patrimony fell to his two sisters Esther and Mary  With this encrease of wealth and with heads and hearts elated by affluence and unrestrained by foresight or discretion the widow Vanhomrich and her two daughters quitted their native country for the more elegant pleasures of the English court During their residence at London they lived in a course of prodigality that stretched itself far beyond the limits of their income and reduced them to great distress in the midst of which the mother died and the two daughters hastened in all secresy back to Ireland beginning their journey on a Sunday  to avoid the interruption of creditors Within two years after their arrival in Ireland Mary the youngest sister died and the small remains of the shipwreck'd fortune center'd in Vanessa  Vanity makes terrible devastations in a female breast Vanessa was excessively vain She was fond of dress impatient to be admired very romantic in her turn of mind superior in her own opinion to all her sex full of pertness gaiety and pride not without some agreeable accomplishments but far from being either beautiful or genteel Ambitious at any rate to be esteemed a wit and with that view always affecting to keep company with wits a great reader and a violent admirer of poetry happy in the thoughts of being reputed Swift's concubine but still aiming to be his wife By nature haughty and disdainful looking with contempt upon her inferiors and with the smiles of selfapprobation upon her equals but upon Dr Swift with the eyes of love Her love was no doubt founded in vanity  Though Vanessa had exerted all the arts of her sex to intangle Swift in matrimony she was yet unsuccessful She had lost her reputation and the narrowness of her income and coldness of her lover contributed to make her miserable and to increase the phrensical disposition of her mind In this melancholly situation she remained several years during which time Cadenus Swift visited her frequently She often press'd him to marry her His answers were rather turns of wit than positive denials till at last being unable to sustain the weight of misery any longer she wrote a very tender epistle to him insisting peremptorily upon a serious answer and an immediate acceptance or absolute refusal of her as his wife His reply was delivered by his own hand He brought it with him when he made his final visit and throwing down the letter  upon the table with great passion hastened back to his house carrying in his countenance the frown of anger and indignation Vanessa did not survive many days the letter delivered to her by Swift but during that short interval she was sufficiently composed to cancel a will made in his favour and to make another wherein she left her fortune which by a long retirement was in some measure retrieved to her two executors Dr Berkley the late lord bishop of Cloyne and Mr Marshal one of the king's Serjeants at law Thus perished under all the agonies of despair Mrs Esther Vanhomrich a miserable example of an illspent life fantastic wit visionary schemes and female weakness  It is strange that vanity should have so great a prevalence in the female breast and yet it is certain that to this principle it was owing that Swift's house was often a seraglio of very virtuous women who attended him from morning till night with an obedience an awe and an assiduity that are seldom paid to the richest or the most powerful lovers These ladies had no doubt a pride in being thought the companions of Swift but the hours which were spent in his company could not be very pleasant as his sternness and authority were continually exerted to keep them in awe  Lord Orrery has informed us that Swift took every opportunity to expose and ridicule Dryden for which he imagines there must have been some affront given by that great man to Swift In this particular we can satisfy the reader from authentic information  When Swift was a young man and not so well acquainted with the world as he afterwards became he wrote some Pindaric Odes In this species of composition he succeeded ill sublimity and fire the indispensable requisites in a Pindaric Ode not being his talent As Mr Dryden was Swift's kinsman these odes were shewn to him for his approbation who said to him with an unreserved  freedom and in the candour of a friend  'Cousin Swift turn your thoughts some other way for nature has never formed you for a Pindaric poet'  Though what Dryden observed might in some measure be true and Swift perhaps was conscious that he had not abilities to succeed in that species of writing yet this honest dissuasive of his kinsman he never forgave The remembrance of it soured his temper and heated his passions whenever Dryden's name was mention'd  We shall now take a view of Swift in his moral life the distinction he has obtained in the literary world having rendered all illustrations of his genius needless  Lord Orrery throughout his excellent work from which we have drawn our account of Swift with his usual marks of candour has displayed his moral character In many particulars the picture he draws of the Dean resembles the portrait of the same person as drawn by Mrs Pilkington  'I have beheld him says his lordship in all humours and dispositions and I have formed various speculations from the several weaknesses to which I observed him liable His capacity and strength of mind were undoubtedly equal to any task whatsoever His pride his spirit or his ambition call it by what name you please was boundless but his views were checked in his younger years and the anxiety of that disappointment had a sensible effect upon all his actions He was sour and severe but not absolutely illnatur'd He was sociable only to particular friends and to them only at particular hours He knew politeness more than he practised it He was a mixture of avarice and generosity the former was frequently prevalent the latter seldom appeared unless excited by compassion He was  open to adulation and would not or could not distinguish between low flattery and just applause His abilities rendered him superior to envy He was undisguised and perfectly sincere I am induced to think that he entered into orders more from some private and fixed resolution than from absolute choice Be that as it may he performed the duties of the church with great punctual  ty and a decent degree of devotion He read prayers rather in a strong nervous voice than in a graceful manner and although he has been often accused of irreligion nothing of that kind appeared in his conversation or behaviour His cast of mind induced him to think and speak more of politics than religion His perpetual views were directed towards power and his chief aim was to be removed to England But when he found himself entirely disappointed he turned his thoughts to opposition and became the Patron of Ireland'  Mrs Pilkington has represented him as a tyrant in his family and has discovered in him a violent propension to be absolute in every company where he was This disposition no doubt made him more feared than loved but as he had the most unbounded vanity to gratify he was pleased with the servility and awe with which inferiors approached him He may be resembled to an eastern monarch who takes delight in surveying his slaves trembling at his approach and kneeling with reverence at his feet  Had Swift been born to regal honours he would doubtless have bent the necks of his people to the yoke As a subject he was restless and turbulent and though as lord Orrery says he was above corruption yet that virtue was certainly founded on his pride which disdained every measure and spurned every effort in which he himself was not the principal  He was certainly charitable though it had an unlucky mixture of ostentation in it One particular act of his charity not mentioned except by Mrs Pilkington in any account of him yet published is well worthy of remembrance praise and imitationHe appropriated the sum of fivehundred pounds intirely to the use of poor tradesmen and handicraftsmen whose honesty and industry he thought merited assistance and encouragement This he lent to them in small loans as their exigencies required without any interest and they repaid him at so much per week or month as their different circumstances best enabled themTo the wealthy let us say  " Abi tu et fac similiter"  Mrs CONSTANTIA GRIERSON  THIS lady was born in Ireland and as Mrs Barber judiciously remarks was one of the most extraordinary women that either this age or perhaps any other ever produced She died in the year at the age of and was allowed long before to be an excellent scholar not only in Greek and Roman literature but in history divinity philosophy and mathematics  Mrs Grierson says she  'gave a proof of her knowledge in the Latin tongue by her dedication of the Dublin edition of Tacitus to the lord Carteret and by that of Terence to his son to whom she likewise wrote a Greek epigram She wrote several fine poems in English  Mrs Barber has preserved several specimens of her talent in this way which are printed with her own poems  on which she set so little value that she neglected to leave copies behind her of but very few  'What makes her character the more remarkable is that she rose to this eminence of learning merely by the force of her own genius and continual application She was not only happy in a fine imagination a great memory an excellent understanding and an exact judgment but had all these crowned by virtue and piety she was too learned to be vain too wise to be  conceited too knowing and too clearsighted to be in religious  'If heaven had spared her life and blessed her wich health which she wanted for some years before her death there is good reason to think she would have made as great a figure in the learned world as any of her sex are recorded to have done  'As her learning and abilities raised her above her own sex so they left her no room to envy any on the contrary her delight was to see others excel She was always ready to advise and direct those who applied to her and was herself willing to be advised  'So little did she value herself upon her uncommon excellences that it has often recalled to my mind a fine reflexion of a French author  That great geniuses should be superior to their own abilities  'I perswade myself that this short account of so extraordinary a woman of whom muc  more might have been said will not be disagreeable to my readers nor can I omit what I think is greatly to the lord Carteret's honour that when he was lord lieutenant of Ireland he obtained a patent for Mr Grierson her husband to be the King's Printer and to distinguish and reward her uncommon merit had her life inserted in it'  Thus far Mrs Barber We shall now subjoin Mrs Pilkington's account of this wonderful genius  'About two years before this a young woman afterwards married to Mr Grierson of about eighteen years of age was brought to my father  Dr Van Lewen of Dublin an eminent physician and manmidwife  to be by him instructed in Midwifry she was mistress of Hebrew  Her knowledge of the Hebrew is not mentioned by Mrs Barber  Greek Latin  and French and understood the mathematics as well as most men and what made those extraordinary talents yet more surprizing was that her parents were poor illiterate country people so that her learning appeared like the gift poured out on the apostles of speaking all languages without the pains of study or like the intuitive knowledge of angels yet inasmuch as the power of miracles is ceased we must allow she used human means for such great and excellent acquirements And yet in a long friendship and familiarity with her I could never obtain a satisfactory account from her on this head only she said she had received some little instruction from the minister of the parish when she could spare time from her needlework to which she was closely kept by her mother She wrote elegantly both in verse and prose and some of the most delightful hours I ever passed were in the conversation of this female philosopher  'My father readily consented to accept of her as a pupil and gave her a general invitation to his table so that she and I were seldom asunder My parents were well pleased with our intimacy as her piety was not inferior to her learning Her turn was chiefly to philosophical or divine subjects yet could her heavenly muse descend from its sublime height to the easy epistolary stile and suit itself to my then gay disposition  Vide Mrs PILKINGTON's MEMOIRS Vol I  '  Mrs CATHERINE COCKBURN  THE Revd Dr Birch who has prefixed a life of Mrs Cockburn before the collection he has made of her works with great truth observes that it is a justice due to the public as well as to the memory of Mrs Cockburn to premise some account of so extraordinary a person "Posterity at least adds he will be so sollicitous to know to whom they will owe the most demonstrative and perspicuous reasonings upon subjects of eternal importance and her own sex is entitled to the fullest information about one who has done such honour to them and raised our ideas of their intellectual powers by an example of the greatest extent of understanding and correctness of judgment united to all the vivacity of imagination Antiquity indeed boasted of its Female Philosophers whose merits have been drawn forth in an elaborate treatise of Menage  Historia Mulierum Philosopharum Svo Lyons  But our own age and country may without injustice or vanity oppose to those illustrious ladies the defender of Lock and Clark who with a genius equal to the most eminent of them had the superior advantage of cultivating it in the only effectual method of improvement the study of a real philosophy and a theology worthy human nature and its allperfect author  She was the daughter of captain David Trotter a Scots gentleman and commander of the royal  navy in the reign of Charles II He was highly in favour with that prince who employed him as commodore in the demolition of Tangier in the year Soon after he was sent to convoy the fleet of the Turkey company when being seized by the plague then raging at Scanderoon he died there His death was an irreparable loss to his family who were defrauded of all his effects on board his ship which were very considerable and of all the money which he had advanced to the seamen during a long voyage And to add to this misfortune the goldsmith in whose hands the greatest part of his money was lodged became soon after a bankrupt These accumulated circumstances of distress exciting the compassion of king Charles the captain's widow was allowed a pension which ended with that king's life nor had she any consideration for her losses in the two succeeding reigns But queen Anne upon her accession to the throne granted her an annual pension of twenty pounds  Captain Trotter at his death left only two daughters the youngest of whom Catherine our celebrated author was born in London August She gave early marks of her genius and was not passed her childhood when she surprized a company of her relations and friends with extemporary verses on an accident which had fallen under her observation in the street She both learned to write and made herself mistress of the French language by her own application and diligence without any instructor But she had some assistance in the study of the Latin Grammar and Logic of which latter she drew up an abstract for her own use The most serious and important subjects and espepecially those of religion soon engaged her attention But notwithstanding her education her intimacy with several families of distinction of the Romish persuasion exposed her while very young to impressions in favour of that church which not being  removed by her conferences with some eminent and learned members of the church of England she followed the dictates of a misguided conscience and embraced the Romish communion in which she continued till the year  She was but years of age when she wrote a copy of verses upon Mr Bevil Higgons's sickness and recovery from the small pox which are printed in our author's second volume Her next production was a Tragedy called Agnes de Castro which was acted at the Theatreroyal in when she was only in her seventeenth year and printed in The reputation of this performance and the verses which she addressed to Mr Congreve upon his Mourning Bride in were probably the foundation of her acquaintance with that admirable writer  Her second Tragedy intitled Fatal Friendship was acted in at the new Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields This Tragedy met with great applause and is still thought the most perfect of her dramatic performances Among other copies of verses sent to her upon occasion of it and prefixed to it was one from an unknown hand which afterwards appeared to be from the elegant pen of Mr Hughs author of the Siege of Damascus  Dr Birch mentions also Mr Higgons's verses on this occasion and gives a copy of a complimentary letter to our author from Mr George Farquhar    The death of Mr Dryden engaged her to join with several other ladies in paying a just tribute to the memory of that great improver of the strength fulness and harmony of English verse and their performances were published together under the title of the Nine Muses or Poems written by so many Ladies upon the Death of the late famous John Dryden  Esq  Her dramatic talents not being confined to Tragedy she brought upon the stage in a Comedy called Love at a Loss or most Votes carry it published in May that year In the same year she gave the public her third Tragedy intitled The Unhappy Penitent acted at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane In the dedication to Charles lord Hallifax she draws the characters of several of the most eminent of her predecessors in tragic poetry with great judgment and precision She observes that Shakespear had all the images of nature present to him studied her thoroughly and boldly copied all her various features and that though he chiefly exerted himself on the more masculine passions it was the choice of his judgment not the restraint of his genius and he seems to have designed those few tender moving scenes which he has given us as a proof that he could be every way equally admirable She allows Dryden to have been the most universal genius which this nation ever bred but thinks that he did not excel in every part for though he is distinguished in most of his writings by greatness and elevation of thought yet at the same time that he commands our admiration of himself he little moves our concern for those whom he represents not being formed for touching the fofter passions On the other hand Otway besides his judicious choice of the fable had a peculiar art to move compassion which as it is one of the chief ends of Tragedy he found most adapted to his genius and never venturing where that did not lead him excelled in the pathetic And had Lee as she remarks consulted his strength as well he might have given us more perfect pieces but aiming at the sublime instead of being great he is extravagant his stile too swelling and if we pursue him in his flight he often carries us out of nature Had he restrained that vain ambition and intirely applied himself to describe the softest of the passions for  love of all the passions he seems best to have understood if that be allowed a proper subject for Tragedy he had certainly had fewer defects  But poetry and dramatic writing did not so far engross the thoughts of our author but that she sometimes turned them to subjects of a very different nature and at an age when few of the other sex were capable of understanding the Essay of Human Understanding and most of them prejudiced against the novelty of its principles and though she was at that time engaged in the profession of a religion not very favourable to so rational a philosophy as that of Mr Lock yet she had read that incomparable book with so clear a comprehension and so unbiassed a judgment that her own conviction of the truth and importance of the notions contained in it led her to endeavour that of others by removing some of the objections urged against them She drew up therefore a Defence of the Essay against some Remarks which had been published against it in The author of these remarks was never known to Mr Lock who animadverted upon them with some marks of chagrin at the end of his reply to Stillingfleet But after the death of the ingenious Dr Thomas Burnet master of the CharterHouse it appeared from his papers that the Remarks were the product of his pen They were soon followed by second Remarks printed the same year in vindication of the first against Mr Lock's Answer to them and in by Third Remarks addressed likewise to Mr Lock Mrs Trotter's Defence of the Essay against all these Remarks was finished so early as the beginning of December when she was but years old But being more apprehensive of appearing before the great writer whom she defended than of the public censure and conscious that the name of a woman would be a prejudice against a work of that nature she resolved to conceal herself with the utmost  care But her title to the reputation of this piece did not continue long a secret to the world For Mrs Burnet the late wife of Dr Burnet bishop of Sarum a lady of an uncommon degree of knowledge and whose Method of Devotion which passed through several editions is a proof of her exemplary piety and who as well as that prelate honoured our author with a particular friendship notwithstanding the difference of her religion being informed that she was engaged in writing and that it was not poetry was desirous to know the subject This Mrs Trotter could not deny a lady of her merit in whom she might safely confide and who upon being acquainted with it shewed an equal sollicitude that the author might not be known But afterwards finding the performance highly approved by the bishop her husband Mr Norris of Bemmerton and Mr Lock himself she thought the reasons of secrecy ceased and discovered the writer and in June returned her thanks to Mrs Trotter then in London for her present of the book in a letter which does as much honour to her own understanding principles and temper as to her friend to whom she addressed it Dr Birch has given a copy of this letter  Mr Lock likewise was so highly satisfied with the Defence which was perhaps the only piece that appeared in favour of his Essay except one by Mr Samuel Bold rector of Steeple in Dorsetshire that being in London he desired Mr King afterwards lord high chancellor to make Mrs Trotter a visit and a present of books and when she had owned herself he wrote to her a letter of compliment a copy of which is inserted in these memoris  But while our author continued to shew the world so deep a penetration into subjects of the most difficult and abstract kind she was still incapable of extricating herself from those subtilties and perplexities  of argument which retained her in the church of Rome And the sincerity of her attachment to it in all its outward severities obliged her to so strict an observance of its fasts as proved extremely injurious to her health Upon which Dr Denton Nicholas a very ingenious learned physician of her acquai  tance advised her to abate of those rigours of absti  ence as insupportable to a constitution naturally infirm  She returned to the exercise of her dramatic genius in and having fixed upon the Revolution of Sweden under Gustavus Erickson which has been related in prose with so much force and beauty by the Abbé Vertot for the subject of a Tragedy she sent the first draught of it to Mr Congreve who returned her an answer which on account of the just remarks upon the conduct of the drama well deserves a place here did it not exceed our proposed bounds and therefore we must refer the reader to Dr Birch's account This Tragedy was acted in at the Queen's Theatre in the HayMarket and was printed in quarto  By a letter from Mrs Trotter to her friend George Burnet of Kemnay in Scotland  Esq  then at Geneva dated February it appears that she then began to entertain more moderate notions of religion and to abate of her zeal for the church of Rome Her charitableness and latitude of sentiments seems to have increased apace from the farther examination which she was now probably making into the state of the controversy between the church of Rome and the Protestants for in another letter to Mr Burnet of August she speaks to the subject of religion with a spirit of moderation unusual in the communion of which she still professed herself  'I wish says she there was no distinction of churches and then I doubt not there would be  much more real religion the name and notion of which I am so sorry to observe con  ined to the being of some particular community and the whole of it I am afraid placed by most in a zeal of those points which make the differences between them from which mistaken zeal no doubt have proceeded all the massacres persecutions and hatred of their follow christians which all churches have been inclined to when in power And I believe it is generally true that those who are most bigotted to a sect or most rigid and precise in their forms and outward discipline are most negligent of the moral duties which certainly are the main end of religion I have observed this so often bothin private persons and public societies that I am apt to suspect it every where'  The victory at Blenheim which exercised the pens of Mr Addison and Mr John Philips whose poems on that occasion divided the admiration of the public tempted Mrs Trotter to write a copy of verses to the duke of Marlborough upon his return from his glorious campaign in Germany December But being doubtful with respect to the publication of them she sent them in manuscript to his grace and received for answer that the duke and duchess and the lord treasurer Godolphin with several others to whom they were shewn were greatly pleased with them and that good judges of poetry had declared that there were some lines in them superior to any that had been written on the subject Upon this encouragement she sent the poem to the press  The high degree of favour with which she was honoured by these illustrious persons gave her about this time hopes of some establishment of her fortune which had hitherto been extremely narrow and precarious But though she failed of such an  establishment she succeeded in in another point which was a temporary relief to her This particular appears from one of her letters printed in the second volume but of what nature or amount this relief was we do not find  Her enquiries into the nature of true religion were attended with their natural and usual effects in opening and enlarging her notions beyond the contracted pale of her own church For in her letter of the th of July to Mr Burnet she says  'I am zealous to have you agree with me in this one article that all good christians are of the same religion a sentiment which I sincerely confess how little soever it is countenanced by the church of Rome'  And in the latter end of the following year or the beginning of her doubts about the Romish religion which she had so many years professed having led her to a thorough examination of the grounds of it by consulting the best books on both fides of the question and advising with men of the best judgment the result was a conviction of the falseness of the pretensions of that church and a return to that of England to which she adhered during the rest of her life In the course of this enquiry the great and leading question concerning A Guide in Controversy was particularly discussed by her and the two letters which she wrote upon it the first to Mr Bennet a Romish priest and the second to Mr H who had procured an answer to that letter from a stranger Mr Bennet's indisposition preventing him from returning one were thought so valuable on account of the strength and perspicuity of reasoning as well as their conciseness that she consented to the importunity of her friends for their publication in June under the following title A Discourse concerning a Guide in Controversies in two Letters Written to one of the  Church of Rome by a Person lately converted from that Communion a later edition of them being since printed at Edinburgh in in vo Bishop Burnet wrote the preface to them though without his name to it and he observes that they might be of use to such of the Roman Catholics as are perswaded that those who deny the infallibility of their church take away all certainty of the Christian religion or of the authority of the scriptures This is the main topic of those two letters and the point was considered by our author as of such importance that she procured her friend Mrs Burnet to consult Mr afterwards Dr Clark upon it and to shew him a paper which had been put into her hands urging the difficulties on that article on the side of the Papists The sentiments of that great man upon this subject are comprised in a letter from Mrs Burnet to Mrs Trotter of which our editor has given a copy to which we refer the reader in the st page of his account  In our author was married to Mr Cockburn the son of Dr Cockburn an eminent and learned divine of Scotland at first attached to the court of St Germains but obliged to quit it on account of his inflexible adherence to the Protestant religion then for some time minister of the Episcopal church at Amsterdam and at last collated to the rectory of Northaw in Middlesex by Dr Robinson bishop of London at the recommendation of Queen Anne Mr Cockburn his son soon after his marriage with our author had the donative of Nayland in Sussex where he settled in the same year but returned afterwards from thence to London to be curate of St Dunstan's in Fleetstreet where he continued 'till the accession of his late majesty to the throne when falling into a scruple about the oath of abjuration though he always prayed for the King and Royal  Family by name he was obliged to quit that station and for ten or twelve years following was reduced to great difficulties in the support of his family during which time he instructed the youth of the academy in ChanceryLane in the Latin tongue At last in by consulting the lord chancellor King and his own father upon the sense and intent of that oath and by reading some papers put into his hands with relation to it he was reconciled to the taking of it In consequence of this being the year following invited to be minister of the Episcopal congregation at Aberdeen in Scotland he qualified himself conformably to the law and on the day of his present Majesty's accession preached a sermon there on the duty and benefit of praying for the government This sermon being printed and animadverted upon he published a reply to the remarks on it with some papers relating to the oath of abjuration which have been much esteemed Soon after his settlement at Aberdeen the lord chancellor presented him to the living of LongHorsely near Morpeth in Northumberland as a means of enabling him to support and educate his family for which purpose he was allowed to continue his function at Aberdeen 'till the negligence and illbehaviour of the curates whom he employed at LongHorsely occasioned Dr Chandler the late bishop of Durham to call him to residence on that living by which means he was forced to quit his station at Aberdeen to the no small diminution of his income He was a man of considerable learning and besides his sermon abovementioned and the vindication of it he published in the Weekly Miscellany A Defence of Prime Ministers in the Character of Joseph and a Treatise of the Mosaic Design published since his death  Mrs Cockburn after her marriage was entirely diverted from her studies for many years by attending  upon the duties of a wife and a mother and by the ordinary cares of an encreasing family and the additional ones arising from the reduced circumstances of her husband However her zeal for Mr Lock's character and writings drew her again into the public light in upon this occasion  Dr Holdsworth fellow of St John's College in Oxford had preached on EasterMonday before that university a fermon on John v which he published professing in his title page to examine and answer the Cavils False Reasonings and False Interpretations of Scripture of Mr Lock and others against the Resurrection of the Same Body This sermon did not reach Mrs Cockburn's hands 'till some years after when the perusal of it forced from her some animadversions which she threw together in the form of a letter to the Dr and sent to him in May with a design of suppressing it entirely if it should have the desired effect upon him After nine months the Dr informed her that he had drawn up a large and particular answer to it but was unwilling to trust her with his manuscript 'till she should publish her own However after a long time and much difficulty she at last obtained the perusal of his answer but not meeting with that conviction from it which would have made her give up her cause she was prevailed on to let the world judge between them and accordingly published her Letter to Dr Holdsworth in January without her name but said in the title page to be by the author of A Defence of Mr Lock's Essay of Human Understanding The Dr whose answer to it was already finished was very expeditious in the publication of it in June in an vo volume under the title of A Defence of the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the same Body c  Mrs Cockburn wrote a very particular reply to this and entitled it A Vindication of Mr Lock's Principles from the injurious Imputations of Dr Holdsworth But though it is an admirable performance and she was extremely desirous of doing justice to Mr Lock and herself yet not meeting with any Bookseller willing to undertake nor herself being able to support the expence of the impression it continued in manuscript and was reserved to enrich the collection published after her death  Her Remarks upon some Writers in the Controversy concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Moral Obligation were begun during the winter of the year and finished in the following one for the weakness of her eyes which had been a complaint of many years standing not permitting her to use by candlelight her needle which so fully employed her in the summer season that she read little and wrote less she amused herself during the long winterevenings in digesting her thoughts upon the most abstract subjects in morality and metaphysics They continued in manuscript till for want of a Bookseller inclined to accept the publication of them and were introduced to the world in August that year in The History of the Works of the Learned Her name did not go with them but they were Inscribed with the utmost Deference to Alexander Pope  Esq  by an Admirer of his moral Character for which she shews a remarkable zeal in her letters whenever she has occasion to mention him And her high opinion of him in that respect founded chiefly on his writings and especially his letters as well as her admiration of his genius inspired her with a strong desire of being known to him for which purpose she drew up a pretty long letter to him about the year but it was never sent The strength clearness and vivacity  shewn in her Remarks upon the most abstract and perplexed questions immediately raised the curiosity of all good judges about the concealed writer and their admiration was greatly increased when her sex and advanced age were known And the worthy Dr Sharp  Author of an excellent pamphlet entitled Two Dissertations concerning the Etymology and Scripturemeaning of the Hebrew Words Elohim and Berith Vide Monthly Review  archdeacon of Northumberland who had these Remarks in manuscript and encouraged the publication of them being convinced by them that no person was better qualified for a thorough examination of the grounds of morality entered into a correspondence with her upon that subject But her ill state of health at last interrupted her prosecution of it a circumstance to be regretted since a discussion carried on with so much sagacity and candour on both sides would in all probability have left little difficulty remaining on the question  Dr Rutherforth's Essay on the Nature and Obligations of virtue published in May soon engaged her thoughts and notwithstanding the asthmatic disorder which had seized her many years before and now left her small intervals of ease she applied herself to the confutation of that elaborate discourse and having finished it with a spirit elegance and perspicuity equal if not superior to all her former writings transmitted her manuscript to Mr Warburton who published it in vo with a Preface of his own in April under the title of Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr Rutherforth's Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue in Vindication of the contrary Principles and Reasons inforced in the Writings of the late Dr Samuel Clark  The extensive reputation which this and her former writings had gained her induced her friends to propose to her the collecting and publishing  them in a body▪ And upon her consenting to the scheme which was to be executed by subscripti on in order to secure to her the full benefit of the edition it met with a ready encouragement from all persons of true taste but though Mrs Cockburn did not live to discharge the office of editor yet the public has received the acquisition by her death of a valuable series of letters which her own modesty would have restrained her from permitting to see the light And it were to be wish+ed that those two volumes conditioned for by the terms of subscription could have contained all her dramatic writings of which only one is here published But a that was impossible the preference was upon the maturest deliberation given to those in prose as superior in their kind to the most perfect of her poetical and of more general and lasting use to the world  The loss of her husband on the th of January in the st year of his age was a severe shock to her and she did not long survive him dying on the th of May in her st year after having long supported a painful disorder with a resignation to the divine will which had been the governing principle of her whole life and her support under the various trials of it Her memory and understanding continued unimpaired 'till within a few days of her death She was interred near her husband and youngest daughter at LongHorsley with this short sentence on their tomb  Let their works praise them in the gates  Prov xxxi  They left only one son who is clerk of the chequ  at Chatham and two daughters  Mrs Cockburn was no less celebrated for her beauty in her younger days than for her genius and  accomplishments She was indeed small of stature but had a remarkable liveliness in her eye and delicacy of complexion which continued to her death Her private character rendered her extremely amiable to those who intimately knew her Her conversation was always innocent useful and agreeable without the least affectation of being thought a wit and attended with a remarkable modesty and diffidence of herself and a constant endeavour to adapt her discourse to her company She was happy in an uncommon evenness and chearfulness of temper Her disposition was generous and benevolent and ready upon all occasions to forgive injuries and bear them as well as mi  fortunes without interrupting her own ease or that of others with complaints or reproaches The prestures of a very contracted fortune were supported by her with calmness and in silence nor did she ever attempt to improve it among those great personages to whom she was known by importunities to which the best minds are most averse and which her approved merit and established reputation should have rendered unnecessary  The collection now exhibited to the world is says Dr Birch and we entirely agree with him so incontestable a proof of the superiority of our author's genius as in a manner supersedes every thing that can be said upon that head But her abilities as a writer and the merit of her works will not have full justice done them without a due attention to the peculiar circumstances in which they were produced her early youth when she wrote some her very advanced age and ill state of health when she drew up others the uneasy situation of her fortune during the whole course of her life and an interval of near twenty years in the vigour of it spent in the cares of a family without the least leisure for reading or contemplation after which with a mind so long  diverted and incumbered resuming her studies she instantly recovered its intire powers and in the hours of relaxation from her domestic

There are very few of these and what there are are of little note Her poetical talent was the smallest and least valuable of our author's literary accomplishments  AMBROSE PHILLIPS  Esq  THIS Gentleman was descended from a very antient and considerable family in the county of Leicester and received his education in St John's college Cambridge where he wrote his Pastorals a species of excellence in which he is thought to have remarkably distinguished himself When Mr Philips quitted the university and repaired to the metropolis hebecame as Mr Jacob phrases it one of the wits at Buttons and in consequence of this contracted an acquaintance with those bright genius's who frequented it especially Sir Richard Steele who in the first volume of his Tatler inserts a little poem of this author's dated from Copenhagen which he calls a winter piece Sir Richard thus mentions it with honour  'This is as fine a piece as we ever had from any of the schools of the most learned painters such images as these give us a new pleasure in our sight and fix upon our minds traces of reflexion which accompany us wherever the like objects occur'  This short performance which we shall here insert was reckoned so elegant by men of taste then living that Mr Pope himself who had a confirmed aversion to Philips when he affected to despise his other works always excepted this out of the number  It is written from Copenhagen addressed to the Earl of Dorset and dated the th of May  A WINTER PIECE  FROM frozen climes and endless tracks of snow  From streams that northern winds forbid to flow  What present shall the Muse to Dorset bring  Or how so near the Pole attempt to sing  The hoary winter here conceals from sight  All pleasing objects that to verse invite  The hills and dales and the delightful woods  The flow'ry plains and silver streaming floods  By snow disguis'd in bright confusion lie  And with one dazling waste fatigue the eye  No gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring  No birds within the desart region sing  The ships unmov'd the boist'rous winds defy  While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly  The vast Leviathan wants room to play  And spout his waters in the face of day  The starving wolves along the main sea prowl  And to the moon in icy valleys howl  For many a shining league the level main  Here spreads itself into a glassy plain  There solid billows of enormous size  Alps of green ice in wild disorder rise  And yet but lately have I seen ev'n here  The winter in a lovely dress appear  Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasur'd snow  Or winds begun through hazy skies to blow  At ev'ning a keen eastern breeze arose  And the descending rain unsully'd froze  Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew  The ruddy morn disclos'd at once to view  The face of nature in a rich disguise  And brighten'd every object to my eyes  And ev'ry shrub and ev'ry blade of grass  And ev'ry pointed thorn seem'd wrought in glass  In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show  While through the ice the crimson berries glow  The thick sprung reeds the watry marshes yield  Seem polish'd lances in a hostile field  The stag in limpid currents with surprize  Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise  The spreading oak the beech and tow'ring pine  Glaz'd over in the freezing aether shine  The frighted birds the rattling branches shun  That wave and glitter in the distant sun  When if a sudden gust of wind arise  The brittle forest into atoms flies  The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends  And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends  Or if a southern gale the region warm  And by degrees unbind the wintry charm  The traveller a miry country sees  And journeys sad beneath the dropping trees  Like some deluded peasant Merlin leads  Thro' fragrant bow'rs and thro' delicious meads  While here inchanted gardens to him rise  And airy fabrics there attract his eyes  His wand ring feet the magic paths pursue  And while he thinks the fair illusion true  The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air  And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear  A tedious road the weary wretch returns  And as he goes the transient vision mourns  But it was not enough for Sir Richard to praise this performance of Mr Philips He was also an admirer of his Pastorals which had then obtained a great number of readers He was about to form  a Critical Comparison of Pope's Pastorals and th  se of Mr Philips and giving in the conclusion the preference to the latter Sir Richard's design being communicated to Mr Pope who was not a little jealous of his reputation he took the alarm and by the most artful and insinuating method defeated his purpose  The reader cannot be ignorant that there are several numbers in the Guardian employed upon Pastoral Poetry and one in particular upon the merits of Philips and Pope in which the latter is found a better versisier but as a true Arcadian the preference is given to Philips That we may be able to convey a perfect idea of the method which Mr Pope took to prevent the diminution of his reputation we shall transcribe the particular parts of that paper in the Guardian Number XL Monday April the th  I designed to have troubled the reader with no farther discourses of Pastorals but being informed that I am taxed of partiality in not mentioning an author whose Eclogues are published in the same volume with Mr Philips's I shall employ this paper in observations upon him written in the free spirit of criticism and without apprehensions of offending that gentleman whose character it is that he takes the greatest care of his works before they are publisned and has the least concern for themafterwards I have laid it down as the first rule of Pastoral that its idea should be taken from the manners of the Golden Age and the moral formed upon the representation of innocence 'tis therefore plain that any deviations from that design degrade a poem from being true Pastoral  So easy as Pastoral writing may seem in the simplicity we have described it yet it requires great reading both of the antients and moderns to be a master of it Mr Philips hath given us manifest proofs of his knowledge of books it must be  confessed his competitor has imitated some single thoughts of the antients well enough if we consider he had not the happiness of an university education but he hath dispersed them here and there without that order and method Mr Philips observes whose whole third pastoral is an instance how well he studied the fifth of Virgil and how judiciously he reduced Virgil's thoughts to the standard of pastoral and his contention of Colin Clout and the Nightingale shews with what exactness he hath imitated Strada When I remarked it as a principal fault to introduce fruits and flowers of a foreign growth in descriptions where the scene lies in our country I did not design that observation should extend also to animals or the sensitive life for Philips hath with great judgment described wolves in England in his first pastoral Nor would I have a poet slavishly confine himself as Mr Pope hath done to one particular season of the year one certain time of the day and one unbroken scene in each Eclogue It is plain Spencer neglected this pedantry who in his Pastoral of November mentions the mournful song of the Nightingale  Sad Philomel her song in tears doth steep  And Mr Philips by a poetical creation hath raised up finer beds of flowers than the most industrious gardener his roses lilies and daffadils blow in the same season  But the better to discover the merit of our two cotemporary pastoral writers I shall endeavour to draw a parallel of them by placing several of their particular thoughts in the same light whereby it will be obvious how much Philips hath the advantage With what simplicity he introduces two shepherds singing alternately  HOBB  COME Rosalind O come for without thee  What pleasure can the country have for me  Come Rosalind O come my brinded kine  My snowy sheep my farm and all is thine  LANG  Come Rosalind O come here shady bowers  Here are cool fountains and here springing flowers  Come Rosalind here ever let us stay  And sweetly waste our livelong time away  Our other pastoral writer in expressing the same thought deviates into downright poetry  STREPHON  In spring the fields in autumn hills I love  At morn the plains at noon the shady grove  But Delia always forc'd from Delia's sight  Nor plains at morn nor groves at noon delight  DAPHNE  Sylvia's like autumn ripe yet mild as May  More bright than noon yet fresh as early day  Ev'n spring displeases when she shines not here  But blest with her 'tis spring throughout the year  In the first of these authors two shepherds thus innocently describe the behaviour of their mistresses  HOBB  As Marian bath'd by chance I passed by  She blush'd and at me cast a side long eye  Then swift beneath the crystal waves she tried  Her beauteous form but all in vain to hide  LANG  As I to cool me bath'd one sultry day  Fond Lydia lurking in the sedges lay  The wanton laugh'd and seem'd in haste to fly  Yet often stopp'd and often turn'd her eye  The other modern who it must be confess'd has a knack at versifying has it as follows  STREPHON  Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain  Thus hid in shades eludes her eager swain  But feigns a laugh to see me search around  And by that laugh the willing fair is found  DAPHNE  The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green  She runs but hopes she does not run unseen  While a kind glance at her pursuer flies  How much at variance are her feet and eyes  There is nothing the writers of this kind of peotry are fonder of than descriptions of pastoral presents  Philips says thus of a Sheephook  Of season'd elm where studs of brass appear  To speak the giver's name the month and year  The hook of polish'd steel the handle turn'd  And richly by the graver's skill adorn'd  The other of a bowl embossed with figures  Where wanton ivy twines  And swelling clusters bend the curling vines  Four figures rising from the work appear  The various seasons of the rolling year  And what is that which binds the radiant sky  Where twelve bright signs in beauteous order lye  The simplicity of the swain in this place who forgets the name of the Zodiac is no ill imitation of Virgil but how much more plainly and unaffectedly would Philips have dressed this thought in his Doric  And what that height which girds the welkin sheen  Where twelve gay signs in meet array are seen  If the reader would indulge his curiosity any farther in the comparison of particulars he may read the first Pastoral of Philips with the second of his contemporary and the fourth and sixth of the former with the fourth and first of the latter where several parallel places will occur to every one  Having now shewn some parts in which these two writers may be compared it is a justice I owe to Mr Philips to discover those in which no man can compare with him First the beautiful rusticity of which I shall now produce two instances out of a hundred not yet quoted  O woeful day O day of woe quoth he  And woeful I who live the day to see  That simplicity of diction the melancholy flowing of the numbers the solemnity of the sound and the easy turn of the words are extremely elegant  In another Pastoral a shepherd utters a Dirge not much inferior to the former in the following lines  Ah me the while ah me the luckless day  Ah luckless lad the rather might I say  Ah silly I more silly than my sheep  Which on the flow'ry plains I once did keep  How he still charms the ear with his artful repetition of the epithets and how significant is the last verse I defy the most common reader to repeat them without feeling some motions of compassion In the next place I shall rank his Proverbs in which I formerly observed he excels For example  A rolling stone is ever bare of moss  And to their cost green years old proverbs cross  He that late lies down as late will rise  And sluggard like till noonday snoring lies  Against illluck all cunning foresight fails  Whether we sleep or wake it nought avails  Nor fear from upright sentence wrong  Lastly His excellent dialect which alone might prove him the eldest born of Spencer and the only true Arcadian c  Thus far the comparison between the merit of Mr Pope and Mr Philips as writers of Pastoral made by the author of this paper in the Guardian after the publication of which the enemies of Pope exulted as in one particular species of poetry upon which he valued himself he was shewn to be inferior to his contemporary For some time they enjoyed their triumph but it turned out at last to their unspeakable mortification  The paper in which the comparison is inserted was written by Mr Pope himself Nothing could have so effectually defeated the design of diminishing his reputation as this method which had a very contrary effect He laid down some false principles upon these he reasoned and by comparing his own and Philips's Pastorals upon such principles it was no great compliment to the latter that he wrote more agreeable to notions which are in themselves false  The subjects of pastoral are as various as the passions of human nature nay it may in some measure partake of every kind of poetry but with this limitation that the scene of it ought always to be laid in the country and the thoughts never contrary to the ideas of those who are bred there The images are to be drawn from rural life and provided the language is perspicuous gentle and flowing the sentiments may be as elegant as the country scenes can furnishIn the particular comparison of passages between Pope and Philips the former is so much superior that one cannot help wondering that Steele could be thus imposed upon who was in other respects a very quick discerner Though 'tis not impossible but that Guardian might go to the press without Sir Richard's seeing it he not being the only person concern'd in that paper  The two following lines so much celebrated in this paper are sufficiently convincing that the whole criticism is ironical  Ah silly I more silly than my sheep  Which on the flowr'y plains I once did keep  Nothing can be much more silly than these lines and yet the author says  "How he still charms the ear with the artful repetitions of epithets"  SILLY I MORE SILLY THAN MY SHEEP  The next work Mr Philips published after his Pastorals and which it is said he wrote at the university was his life of John Williams lord keeper of the greatseal bishop of Lincoln and archbishop of York in the reigns of king James and Charles the First in which are related some remarkable occurrences in those times both in church and state with an appendix giving an account of his benefactions to St John's college  Mr Philips seems to have made use of archbishop William's life the better to make known his own state principles which in the course of that work he had a fair occasion of doing Bishop Williams was the great opposer of HighChurch measures he was a perpetual antagonist to Land and lord Clarendon mentions him in his history with very great decency and respect when it is considered that they adhered to opposite parties  Mr Philips who early distinguished himself in revolution principles was concerned with Dr Boulter afterwards archbishop of Armagh the right honourable Richard West  Esq  lord chancellor of Ireland the revd Mr Gilbert Burnet and the revd Mr Henry Stevens in writing a paper called the FreeThinker but they were all published by Mr Philips and since reprinted in three volumes in mo In the latter part of the reign of queen Anne he was secretary to the HanoverClub a set of noblemen and gentlemen who associated in honour of that succession They drank regular toasts to the health of those ladies who were most zealously attached to the Hanoverian family upon whom Mr Philips wrote the following lines  While these the chosen beauties of our isle  Propitious on the cause of freedom smile  The rash Pretender's hopes we may despise  And trust Britannia's safety to their eyes  After the accession of his late majesty Mr Philips was made a justice of peace and appointed a commissioner of the lottery But though his circumstances were easy the state of his mind was not so he fell under the severe displeasure of Mr Pope who has satirized him with his usual keenness  'Twas said he used to mention Mr Pope as an enemy to the government and that he was the avowed author of a report very industriously spread that he had a hand in a paper called The Examiner The revenge which Mr Pope took in consequence of this abuse greatly reffled the temper of Mr Philips who as he was not equal to him in wit had recourse to another weapon in the exercise of which no great parts are requisite He hung up a rod at Button's with which he resolved to chastise his antagonist whenever he should come there But Mr Pope who got notice of this design very prudently declined coming to a place where in all probability he must have felt the resentment of an enraged author as much superior to him in bodily strength as inferior in wit and genius  When Mr Philips's friend Dr Boulter rose to be archbishop of Dublin he went with him into Ireland where he had considerable preferments and was a member of the House of Commons there as representative of the county of Armagh  Notwithstanding the ridicule which Mr Philips has drawn upon himself by his opposition to Pope and the disadvantageous light his Pastorals appear in when compared with his yet there is good reason to believe that Mr Philips was no mean Arcadian By endeavouring to imitate too servilely the manners and sentiments of vulgar rustics he has sometimes raised a laugh against him yet there are in some of his Pastorals a natural simplicity a true Doric dialect and very graphical descriptions  Mr Gildon in his compleat Art of Poetry mentions him with Theocritus and Virgil but then  he defeats the purpose of his compliment for by carrying the similitude too far he renders his panegyric hyperbolical  We shall now consider Mr Philips as a dramatic writer The first piece he brought upon the stage was his Distress'd Mother translated from the French of Monsieur Racine but not without such deviations as Mr Philips thought necessary to heighten the distress for writing to the heart is a secret which the best of the French poets have not found out This play was acted first in the year with every advantage a play could have Pyrrhus was performed by Mr Booth a part in which he acquired great reputation Orestes was given to Mr Powel and Andromache was excellently personated by the inimitable Mrs Oldfield Nor was Mrs Porter beheld in Hermione without admiration The Distress'd Mother is so often acted and so frequently read we shall not trouble the reader with giving any farther account of it  A modern critic speaking of this play observes that the distress of Andromache moves an audience more than that of Belvidera who is as amiable a wife as Andromache is an affectionate mother their circumstances though not similar are equally interesting and yet says he  'the female part of the audience is more disposed to weep for the suffering mother than the suffering wife  Vide the ACTOR  '  The reason 'tis imagin'd is this there are more affectionate mothers in the world than wives  Mr Philips's next dramatic performance was  The Briton a Tragedy acted This is built on a very interesting and affecting story whether founded on real events I cannot determine  but they are admirably fitted to raise the passion peculiar to tragedy Vanoc Prince of the Cornavians married for his second wife Cartismand Queen of the Brigantians a woman of an imperious spirit who proved a severe stepmother to the King's daughter Gwendolen betrothed to Yvor the Prince of the Silurians The mutual disagreement between Vanoc and his Queen at last produced her revolt from him She intrigues with Vellocad who had been formerly the King's servant and enters into a league with the Roman tribune in order to be revenged on her husband Vanoc fights some successful battles but his affairs are thrown into the greatest confusion upon receiving the news that a party of the enemy has carried off the Princess his daughter She is conducted to the tent of Valens the Roman tribune who was himself in love with her but who offered her no violation He went to Vanoc in the name of Didius the Roman general to offer terms of peace but he was rejected with indignation The scene between Vanoc and Valens is one of the most masterly to be met with in tragedy Valens returns to his fair charge while her father prepares for battle and to rescue his daughter by the force of arms But Cartismand who knew that no mercy would be shewn her at the hands of her stern husband flies to the Princess's tent and in the violence of her rage stabs her The King and Yvor enter that instant but too late to save the beauteous Gwendolen from the blow who expires in the arms of her betrothed husband a scene wrought up with the greatest tenderness When the King reproaches Cartismand for this deed of horror she answers  Hadst thou been more forgiving I had been less cruel  VANOC  Wickedness barbarian monster  What had she done alasSweet innocence  She would have interceded for thy crimes  CARTISMAND  Too well I knew the purpose of thy soul  Didst thou believe I would submitresign my crown  Or that thou only hadst the power to punish  VANOC  Yet I will punishmeditate strange torments  Then give thee to the justice of the Gods  CARTISMAND  Thus Vanoc do I mock thy treasur'd rage  My heart springs forward to the dagger's point  VANOC  Quick wrest it from herdrag her hence to chains  CARTISMAND  There needs no second stroke  Adieu rash manmy woes are at an end  Thine's but begunand lasting as thy life  Mr Philips in this play has shewn how well he was acquainted with the stage he keeps the scene perpetually busy great designs are carrying on the incidents rise naturally from one another and the catastrophe is moving He has not observed the rules which some critics have established of distributing poetical justice for Gwendolen the most amiable character in the play is the chief  sufferer arising from the indulgence of no irregular passion nor any guilt of hers  The next year Mr Philips introduced another tragedy on the stage called Humfrey Duke of Gloucester acted The plot of this play is founded on history During the minority of Henry VI his uncle the duke of Gloucester was raised to the dignity of Regent of the Realm This high station could not but procure him many enemies amongst whom was the duke of Suffolk who in order to restrain his power and to inspire the mind of young Henry with a love of independence effected a marriage between that Prince and Margaret of Anjou a Lady of the most consummate beauty and what is very rare amongst her sex of the most approved courage This lady entertained an aversion for the duke of Gloucester because he opposed her marriage with the King and accordingly resolves upon his ruin  She draws over to her party cardinal Beaufort the Regent's uncle a supercilious proud churchman They fell upon a very odd scheme to shake the power of Gloucester and as it is very singular and absolutely fact we shall here insert it  The duke of Gloucester had kept Eleanor Cobham daughter to the lord Cobham as his concubine and after the dissolution of his marriage with the countess of Hainault he made her his wife but this did not restore her reputation she was however too young to pass in common repute for a witch yet was arrested for high treason founded on a pretended piece of witchcraft and after doing public penance several days by sentence of convocation was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in the Isle of Man but afterwards removed to Killingworthcastle The fact charged upon her was the making an image of wax resembling the King and treated in such a manner by incantations and sorceries as to make  him waste away as the image gradually consumed John Hume her chaplain Thomas Southwell a canon of St Stephen's Westminster Roger Bolingbroke a clergyman highly esteemed and eminent for his uncommon learning and merit and perhaps on that account reputed to have great skill in necromancy and Margery Jourdemain commonly called The Witch of Eye were tried as her accomplices and condemned the woman to be burnt the others to be drawn hanged and quartered at Tyburn  See Cart's History of England Reign of Henry VI  This hellish contrivance against the wife of the duke of Gloucester was meant to shake the influence of her husband which in reality it did as ignorance and credulity cooperated with his enemies to destroy him He was arrested for high treason a charge which could not be supported and that his enemies might have no further trouble with him cardinal Beaufort hired assassins to murder him The poet acknowledges the hints he has taken from the Second Part of Shakespear's Henry VI and in some scenes has copied several lines from him In the last scene that pathetic speech of Eleanor's to Cardinal Beaufort when he was dying in the agonies of remorse and despair is literally borrowed  WARWICK  See how the pangs of death work in his features  YORK  Disturb him notlet him pass peaceably  ELEANOR  Lord Cardinalif thou think'st of Heaven's bliss  Hold up thy handmake signal of that hope  He diesand makes no sign  In praise of this tragedy Mr Welsted has prefixed a very elegant copy of verses  Mr Philips by a way of writing very peculiar procured to himself the name of Namby Pamby This was first bestowed on him by Harry Cary who burlesqued some little pieces of his in so humorous a manner that for a long while Harry's burlesque passed for Swift's with many and by others were given to Pope 'Tis certain each at first took it for the other's composition  In ridicule of this manner the ingenious Hawkins Brown  Esq  now a Member of Parliament in his excellent burlesque piece called The Pipe of Tobacco has written an imitation in which the resemblance is so great as not to be distinguished from the original This gentleman has burlesqued the following eminent authors by such a close imitation of their turn of verse that it has not the appearance of a copy but an original  SWIFT  POPE  THOMSON  YOUNG  PHILIPS  CIBBER  As a specimen of the delicacy of our author's turn of versification we shall present the reader with his translation of the following beautiful Ode of Sappho  HYMN to VENUS    OVENUS beauty of the skies  To whom a thousand temples rise  Gayly false in gentle smiles  Full of love perplexing wiles  O Goddess from my heart remove  The wasting cares and pains of love    If ever thou hast kindly heard  A song in soft distress preferr'd  Propitious to my tuneful vow  O gentle goddess hear me now  Descend thou bright immortal guest  In all thy radiant charms confess'd    Thou once did leave almighty Jove  And all the golden roofs above  The carr thy wanton sparrows drew  Hov'ring in air they lightly flew  As to my bower they wing'd their way  I saw their quiv'ring pinions play    The birds dismiss'd while you remain  Bore back their empty car again  Then you with looks divinely mild  In ev'ry heav'nly feature smil'd  And ask'd what new complaints I made  And why I call'd you to my aid    What frenzy in my bosom rag'd  And by what cure to be asswag'd  What gentle youth I would allure  Whom in my artful toils secure  Who does thy tender heart subdue  Tell me my Sappho tell me who    Tho' now he shuns my longing arms  He soon shall court thy slighted charms  Tho' now thy off'rings he despise  He soon to thee shall sacrifice  Tho' now he freeze he soon shall burn  And be thy victim in his turn    Celestial visitant once more  Thy needful presence I implore  In pity come and ease my grief  Bring my distemper'd soul relief  Favour thy suppliant's hidden fires  And give me all my heart's desires  There is another beautiful ode by the same Grecian poetess rendered into English by Mr Philips with inexpressible delicacy quoted in the Spectator vol iii No    Blest as th' immortal Gods is he  The youth who fondly sits by thee  And hears and sees thee all the while  Softly speak and  weetly smile    'Twas this depriv'd my soul of rest  And raised such tumults in my breast  For while I gaz'd in transport tost  My breath was gone my voice was lost    My bosom glow'd the subtle flame  Ran quick thro' all my vital frame  O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung  My ears with hollow murmurs rung    In dewy damps my limbs were chill'd  My blood with gentle horrors thrill'd  My feeble pulse forgot to play  I fainted sunk and died away  Mr Philips having purchased an annuity of l per annum for his life came over to England sometime in the year But had not his health and died soon after at his lodgings near Vauxhall  RICHARD MAITLAND Earl of LAUDERDALE  THIS learned nobleman was nephew to John the great duke of Lauderdale who was secretary of state to King Charles II for Scotch affairs and for many years had the government of that kingdom entirely entrusted to him Whoever is acquainted with history will be at no loss to know with how little moderation he exercised his power he ruled his native country with a rod of iron and was the author of all those disturbances and persecutions which have stained the Annals of Scotland during that inglorious period  As the duke of Lauderdale was without issuemale of his own body he took our author into his protection as his immediate heir and ordered him to be educated in such a manner as to qualify him for the possession of those great employments his ancestors enjoyed in the state The improvement of this young nobleman so far exceeded his years that he was very early admitted into the privy council and made lord justice clerk anno He married the daughter of the earl of Argyle who was tried for sedition in the state and confined in the castle of Edinburgh When Argyle found his fate approaching he meditated and effected his escape and some letters of his  being intercepted and decyphered which had been written to the earl of Lauderdale his lordship fell under a cloud and was stript of his preferments These letters were only of a familiar nature and contained nothing but domestic business but a correspondence with a person condemned was esteemed a sin in politics not to be forgiven especially by a man of the Duke of York's furious disposition  Though the duke of Lauderdale had ordered our author to be educated as his heir yet he left all his personal estate which was very great to another the young nobleman having by some means disobliged him and as he was of an ungovernable implacable temper could never again recover his favour  Crawford's Peerage of Scotland  Though the earl of Lauderdale was thus removed from his pla  es by the court yet he persisted in his loyalty to the Royal Family and upon the revolution followed the fortune of King James II and some years after died in France leaving no surviving issue so that the titles devolved on his younger brother  While the earl was in exile with his Royal master he applied his mind to the delights of poetry and in his leisure hours compleated a translation of Virgil's works Mr Dryden in his dedication of the Aeneis thus mentions it  'The late earl of Lauderdale says he sent me over his new translation of the Aeneis which he had ended before I engaged in the same design Neither did I then intend it but some proposals being afterwards made me by my Bookseller I desired his lordship's leave that I might accept them which he freely granted and I have his letter to shew for that permission He resolved to have printed his work which he might have done two years before I could have published  mine and had performed it if death had not prevented him But having his manuscript in my hands I consulted it as often as I doubted of my author's sense for no man understood Virgil better than that learned nobleman His friends have yet another and more correct copy of that translation by them which if they had pleased to have given the public the judges might have been convinced that I have not flattered him'  Lord Lauderdale's friends some years after the publication of Dryden's Translation permitted his lordship's to be printed and in the late editions of that performance those lines are marked with inverted commas which Dryden thought proper to adopt into his version which are not many and however closely his lordship may have rendered Virgil no man can conceive a high opinion of that poet contemplated through the medium of his Translation  Dr Trapp in his preface to the Aeneis observes  'that his lordship's Translation is pretty near to the original though not so close as its brevity would make one imagine and it sufficiently appears that he had a right taste in poetry in general and the Aeneid in particular He shews a true spirit and in many places is very beautiful But we should certainly have seen Virgil far better translated by a noble hand had the earl of Lauderdale been the earl of Roscommon and had the Scottish peer followed all the precepts and been animated with the genius of the Irish'  We know of no other poetical compositions of this learned nobleman and the idea we have received from history of his character is that he was in every respect the reverse of his uncle  from whence we may reasonably conclude that  he possessed many virtues since few statesmen of any age ever were tainted with more vices than the duke of Lauderdale  Dr JOSEPH TRAPP  THIS poet was second son to the rev Mr Joseph Trapp rector of Cherington in Gloucestershire at which place he was born anno He received the first rudiments of learning from his father who instructed him in the languages and superintended his domestic education  Jacob  When he was ready for the university he was sent to Oxford and was many years scholar and fellow of WadhamCollege where he took the degree of master of arts In the year he was unanimously chosen professor of poetry being the first of that kind This institution was founded by Dr Henry Birkhead formerly fellow of AllSouls and the place of lecturer can be held only for ten years  Dr Trapp was in the early part of his life chaplain to lord Bolingbroke the father of the famous Bolingbroke lately deceased The highest preferment Dr Trapp ever had in the church though he was a man of extensive learning was the rectory of Harlington Middlesex and of the united parishes of ChristChurch NewgateStreet  and St Leonard's FosterLane with the lectureship of St Lawrence Jewry and St Martin's in the Fields The Dr's principles were not of that cast by which promotion could be expected He was attached to the HighChurch interest and as his temper was not sufficiently pliant to yield to the prevalence of party perhaps for that very reason his rising in the church was retarded A gentleman of learning and genius when paying a visit to the Dr took occasion to lament as there had been lately some considerable alterations made and men less qualified than he raised to the mitre that distinctions should be conferred with so little regard to merit and wondered that he the Dr had never been promoted to a see To this the Dr replied  'I am thought to have some learning and some honesty and these are but indifferent qualifications to enable a man to rise in the church'  Dr Trapp's action in the pulpit has been censured by many as participating too much of the theatrical manner and having more the air of an itinerant enthusiast than a grave ecclesiastic Perhaps it may be true that his pulpit gesticulations were too violent yet they bore strong expressions of sincerity and the side on which he erred was the most favourable to the audience as the extreme of overacting any part is not half so intolerable as a languid indifference whether what the preacher is then uttering is true or false is worth attention or no The Dr being once in company with a person whose profession was that of a player took occasion to ask him  'what was the reason that an actor seemed to feel his part with so much sincerity and utter it with so much emphasis and spirit while a preacher whose profession is of a higher nature  and whose doctrines are of the last importance remained unaffected even upon the most solemn occasion while he stood in the pulpit as the ambassador of God to teach righteousness to the people'  the player replied  'I believe no other reason can be given sir but that we are sincere in our parts and the preachers are insincere in theirs'  The Dr could not but acknowledge the truth of this observation in general and was often heard to complain of the coldness and unaffected indifference of his brethren in those very points in which it is their business to be sincere and vehement Would you move your audience says an ancient sage you must yourself be moved and it is a proposition which holds universally true Dr Trapp was of opinion that the highest doctrines of religion were to be considered as infallibly true and that it was of more importance to impress them strongly on the minds of the audience to speak to their hearts and affect their passions than to bewilder them in disputation and lead them through labyrinths of controversy which can yield perhaps but little instruction can never tend to refine the passions or elevate the mind Being of this opinion and from a strong desire of doing good Dr Trapp exerted himself in the pulpit and strove not only to convince the judgment but to warm the heart for if passions are the elements of life they ought to be devoted to the service of religion as well as the other faculties and powers of the soul  But preaching was not the only method by which this worthy man promoted the interest of religion he drew the muses into her service and that be might work upon the hopes and fears of his readers he has presented them with four poems on these important subjects  Death Judgment Heaven  and  Hell  The reason of his making  choice of those themes on which to write he very fully explains in his preface He observes that however dull and  ite it may be to declaim against the corruption of the age one lives in yet he presumes it will be allowed by every body that all manner of wickedness both in principles and practice abounds amongst men  'I have lived says he in six reigns but for about these twenty years last past the English nation has been and is so prodigiously debauched its very nature and genius so changed that I scarce know it to be the English nation and am almost a foreigner in my own country Not only barefaced impudent immorality of all kinds but often professed infidelity and atheism To stop these overflowings of ungodliness much has been done in prose yet not so as to supersede all other endeavours and therefore the author of these poems was willing to try whether any good might be done in verse This manner of conveyance may perhaps have some advantage which the other has not at least it makes variety which is something considerable The four last things are manifestly subjects of the utmost importance If due reflexions upon Death Judgment Heaven and Hell will not reclaim men from their vices nothing will This little work was intended for the use of all from the greatest to the least But as it would have been intolerably flat and insipid to the former had it been wholly written in a stile level to the capacities of the latter to obviate inconveniences on both sides an attempt has been made to entertain the upper class of readers and by notes to explain such passages in divinity philosophy history c as might be difficult to the lower The work if it may be so called being partly argumentative and partly descriptive it would have been ridiculous had it been possible  to make the first mentioned as poetical as the other In long pieces of music there is the plain recitativo as well as the higher and more musical modulation and they mutually recommond and set off each other But about these matters the writer is little sollicitous any otherwise than as they are subservient to the design of doing good'  A good man would naturally wish that such generous attempts in the cause of virtue were always successful With the lower class of readers it is more than probable that these poems may have inspired religious thoughts have awaked a solemn dread of punishment kindled a sacred hope of happiness and fitted the mind for the four last important periods  By  is last Will he ordered a copy of that book to be given to each of his parishioners that when he could no longer speak to them from the pulpit he might endeavour to instruct them in his writings  But with readers of a higher taste they can have but little effect There is no doctrine placed in a new light no descriptions are sufficiently emphatical to work upon a sensible mind and the perpetual flatness of the poetry is very disgustful to a critical reader especially as there were so many occasions of rising to an elevated sublimity  The Dr has likewise written a Paraphrase on the th Psalm which though much superior in poetry to his Four Last Things yet falls greatly short of that excellent version by Mr Blacklocke quoted in the Life of Dr Brady  Our author has likewise published four volumes of sermons and a volume of lectures on poetry writ  en in Latin  Before we mention his other poetical compositions we shall consider him as the translator of Virgil which is the most arduous province he ever undertook Dr Trapp in his preface after stating the controversy which has been long held  concerning the genius of Homer and Virgil to whom the superiority belongs has informed us that this work was very far advanced before it was undertaken having been for many years the diversion of his leisure hours at the university and grew upon him by insensible degrees so that a great part of the Aeneis was actually translated before he had any design of attempting the whole  He further informs us  'that one of the greatest geniuses and best judges and critics our age has produced Mr Smith of Christ Church having seen the first two or three hundred lines of this translation advised him by all means to go through with it I said he laughed at me replied the Dr and that I should be the most impudent of mortals to have such a thought He told me he was very much in earnest and asked me why the whole might not be done in so many years as well as such a number of lines in so many days which had no influence upon me nor did I dream of such an undertaking 'till being honoured by the university of Oxford with the public office of professor of poetry which I shall ever gratefully acknowledge I thought it might not be improper for me to review and finish this work which otherwise had certainly been as much neglected by me as perhaps it will now be by every body else'  As our author has made choice of blank verse rather than rhime in order to bear a nearer resemblance to Virgil he has endeavoured to defend blank verse against the advocates for rhime and shew its superiority for any work of length as it gives the expression a greater compass or at least does not clog and fetter the verse by which the substance and meaning of a line must often be mutilated twisted and sometimes sacrificed for the sake of the rhime  'Blank verse says he is not only more majestic and sublime but more musical and harmonious It has more rhime in it according to the ancient  and true sense of the word than rhime itself as it is now used for in its o  iginal signification it consists not in the tinkling of vowels and consonants but in the metrical disposition of words and syllables and the proper cadence of numbers which is more agreeable to the ear without the jingling of like endings than with it And indeed let a man consult his own ears  Him th' Almighty pow'r  Hurl'd headlong flaming from the aetherial sky  With hideous ruin and combustion down  To bottomless perdition there to dwell  In adamantine chains a  d penal fire  Who durst de  y th' Omnipotent to arms  Nine times the space that measures day and night  To mortal men he with his horrid crew  Lay vanquish'd rowling in the fiery gulph  Confounded tho' immortal  Who that hears this can think it wants rhime to recommend it or rather does not think it sounds far better without it We purposely produced a citation beginning and ending in the middle of a verse because the privilege of resting on this or that foot sometimes one and sometimes another and so diversifying the pauses and cadences is the greatest beauty of blank verse and perfectly agreeable to the practice of our masters the Greeks and Romans This can be done but rarely in rhime for if it were frequent the rhime would be in a manner lost by it the end of almost every verse must be something of a pause and it is but seldom that a sentence begins in the middle Though this seems to be the advantage of blank verse over rhime yet we cannot entirely condemn the use of it even in a heroic poem nor absolutely reject that in speculation which Mr  Dryden and Mr Pope have enobled by their practice We acknowledge too that in some particular views that way of writing has the advantage over this You may pick out more lines which singly considered look mean and low from a poem in blank verse than from one in rhime supposing them to be in other respects equal For instance the following verses out of Milton's Paradise Lost b ii  Of Heav'n were falling and these elements  Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him  taken singly look low and mean but read them in conjunction with others and then see what a different face will be set upon them  Or less than of this srame  Of Heav'n were falling and these elements  In mutiny had from her axle torn  The stedfast earth At last his sailbroad vans  He spreads for flight and in the surging smoke  Uplifted spurns the ground  Had not by ill chance  The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud  Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him  As many miles aloft That fury stay'd  Quench'd in a boggy syrtis neither sea  Nor good dry land nigh founder'd on he fares  Treading the crude consistence  Our author has endeavoured to justify his choice of blank verse by shewing it less subject to restraints and capable of greater sublimity than rhime But tho' this observation may hold true with respect to elevated and grand subjects blank verse is by no means capable of so great universality In satire in elegy or in pastoral writing our language is it seems so feebly constituted  as to stand in need of the aid of rhime and as a proof of this the reader need only look upon the pastorals of Virgil as translated by Trapp in blank verse and compare them with Dryden's in rhime He will then discern how insipid and f  at the pastorals of the same poet are in one kind of versification and how excellent and beautiful in another Let us give one short example to illustrate the truth of this from the first pastoral of Virgil  MELIBAEUS  Beneath the covert of the spreading beech  Thou Tityrus repos'd art warbling o'er  Upon a slender reed thy sylvan lays  We leave our country and sweet native fields  We fly our country careless in the shade  Thou teachest Tityrus the sounding groves  To eccho beauteous Amaryllis' name  TITYRUS  O Melibaeus 'twas a god to us  Indulg'd this freedom for to me a god  He shall be ever from my folds full oft  A tender lamb his altar shall embrue  He gave my heifers as thou seest to roam  And me permitted on my rural cane  To sport at pleasure and enjoy my muse  TRAPP  MELIBAEUS  Beneath the shade which beechenboughs diffuse  You Tityrus entertain your Silvan muse  Round the wide world in banishment we roam  Forc'd from our pleasing fields and native home  While stretch'd at ease you sing your happy loves  And Amaryllis fills the shady groves  TITYRUS  These blessings friend a deity bestow'd  For never can I deem him less than God  The tender firstlings of my woolly breed  Shall on his holy altar often bleed  He gave my kine to graze the flowry plain  And to my pipe renew'd the rural strain  DRYDEN  Dr Trapp towards the conclusion of his Preface to the Aeneid has treated Dryden with less reverence than might have been expected from a man of his understanding when speaking of so great a genius The cause of Trapp's disgust to Dryden seems to have been this Dryden had a strong contempt sor the priesthood which we have from his own words  " Priests of all professions are the same"  and takes every opportunity to mortify the usurping superiority of spiritual tyrants Trapp with all his virtues for I think it appears he possessed many had yet much of the priest in him and for that very reason perhaps has shewn some resentment to Dryden but if he has with little candour of criticism treated Mr Dryden he has with great se  vility flattered Mr Pope  nd has insinuated as if the Palm of Genius were to be yielded to the latter He observes in general that where Mr Dryden shines most we often see the least of Virgil To omit many other instances the description  of the Cyclops forging Thunder for Jupiter and Armour for Aeneas is elegant and noble to the last degree in the Latin and it is so to a great degree in the English But then is the English a translation of the Latin  Hither the father of the fire by night  Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight  On their eternal anvil here he found  The brethren beating and the blows go round  The lines are good and truely poetical but the two first are set to render  Hoc tunc ignipotens caelo descendit ab alto  There is nothing of  caelo ab alto  in the version nor by  night brown air  or  precipitates his flight  in the original The two last are put in the room of  Ferrum exercebant vasto Cylopes in antro  Brontesque Steropesque nudus membra Pyracmon  Vasto in antro in the first of these lines and the last line is entirely left out in the translation Nor is there any thing of eternal anvils or  here be found  in the original and the brethren beating and the blows go round is but a loose version of  Ferrum exercebant  Dr Trapp has allowed however that though Mr Dryden is often distant from the original yet he sometimes rises to a more excellent height by throwing out implied graces which none but so great a poet was capable of Thus in the  th book after the last speech of S    Tantum effata caput glauco contexit amictu  Multa gemens se fluvio Dea condidit alto  She drew a length of sighs no more she said  But with an azure mantle wrapp'd her head  Then plunged into her stream with deep despair  And her last Jobs came bubbling up in air  Though the last line is not expressed in the original it is yet in some measure implied and it is in itself so exceedingly beautiful that the whole passage can never be too much admired These are excellencies indeed this is truly Mr Dryden The power of truth no doubt extorted this confession from the Dr and notwithstanding many objections may be brought against this performance of Dryden yet we believe most of our poetical readers upon perusing it will be of the opinion of Pope  'that excepting a few human errors it is the noblest and most spirited translation in any language'  To whom it may reasonably be asked has Virgil been most obliged to Dr Trapp who has followed his footsteps in every line has shewn you indeed the design the characters contexture and moral of the poem that is has given you Virgil's account of the actions of Aeneas or to Mr Dryden who has not only conveyed the general ideas of his author but has conveyed them with the same majesty and fire has led you through every battle with trepidation has soothed you in the tender scenes and inchanted you with the flowers of poetry Virgil con  emplated thro' the medium of Trapp appears an accurate writer and the Aeneid a well conducted fable but discerned in Dryden's page he glows as with fire from heaven and the Aeneid is a continued series of whatever is great elegant pathetic and sublime  We have already observed in the Life of Dryden that it is easier to discern wherein the beauties of poetical composition consist than to throw out th  se beauties Dr Trapp in his Praelectiones Poe  icae has shewn how much he was master of every species of poetry that is how excellently he understood the structure of a poem what noble rules he was capable of laying down and what excellent materials he could afford for building upon such a foundation a beautiful fabric There are few better criticisms in any language Dryden's dedications and prefaces excepted than are contained in these lectures The mind is enlarged by them takes in a wide range of poetical ideas and is taught to discover how many amazing requisites are necessary to form a poet In his introduction to the first lecture he takes occasion to state a comparison between poetry and painting and shew how small pretensions the professors of the latter have to compare themselves with the former 'The painter indeed says he has to do with the passions but then they are such passions only as discover themselves in the countenance but the poet is to do more he is to trace the rise of those passions to watch their gradations to paint their progress and mark them in the heart in their genuine conflicts and continues he the disproportion between the soul and the body is not greater than the disproportion between the painter and the poet  Dr Trapp is author of a tragedy called Abramule or Love and Empire acted at the New Theatre at Lincoln'sInnFields dedicated to the Right Honourable the Lady Harriot Godolphin Scene Constantinople The story is built upon the dethronement of Mahomet IV  Our au  hor has likewise written a piece called The Church of England Defended against the False Reasoning of the Church of Rome Several occasional poems were written by him in English and there is one Latin poem of his in the Musae Anglicanae He has translated the Paradise Lost into Latin Verse with little success and as he published it at his own risk he was a considerable loser The capital blemish of that work is the unharmonious ver  ification which gives perpetual offence to the ear neither is the language universally pure  He died in the month of November and left behind him the character of a pathetic and instructive preacher a profound scholar a discerning critic a benevolent gentleman and a pious Christian  We shall conclude the life of Dr Trapp with the following verses of Mr Layng which are expressive of the Dr's character as a critic and a poet The author after applanding Dryden's version proceeds thus in favour of Trapp  Behind we see a younger bard arise  No vulgar rival in the grand emprize  Hail learned Trapp upon whose brow we find  The poet's bays and critic's ivy join'd  Blest saint to all that's virtuous  ver dear  Thy recent fate demands a friendly tear  None was more vers'd in all the Roman store  Or the wide circle of the Grecian lore  Less happy from the world recluse too long  In all the sweeter ornaments of song  Intent to teach too careless how to please  He boasts in strength whate'er he wants in ease  Mr SAMUEL BOYSE  THIS Poet was the son of the Revd Mr Joseph Boyse a Dissenting minister of great eminence in Dublin Our author's father was a person so much respected by those immediately under his ministerial care and whoever else had the happiness of his acquaintance that people of all denominations united in esteeming him not only for his learning and abilities but his extensive humanity and undissembled piety  This Revd Gentleman had so much dignity in his manner that he obtained from the common people the name of bishop Boyse meant as a compliment to the gracefulness of his person and mien But though Mr Boyse was thus reverenced by the multitude and courted by people of fashion be never contracted the least air of superciliousness He was humane and affable in his temper equally removed from the stiffness of pedantry and offensive levity During his ministerial charge at Dublin he published many sermons which compose several folio volumes a few Poems and other Tracts but what chiefly distinguished him as a writer was the controversy he carried on with Dr King archbishop of Dublin and author of the Origin of Evil concerning the office of a scriptural bishop This controverted point was managed on both sides with great force of argument and calmness of temper The bishop asserted that the episcopal right of jurisdiction had its foundation in the NewTestament Mr Boyse consistent with his principles denied that  any ecclesiastical superiority appeared there and in the opinion of many Mr Boyse was more than equal to his antagonist whom he treated in the course of the controversy with the greatest  and good manners  It has been reported that Mr Boyse had two brothers one a clergyman of the church of England and the other a cardinal at Rome but of this circumstance we have no absolute certainty Be it as it may he had however no brother so much distinguished in the world as himself  We shall now enter upon the life of our poet who will appear while we trace it to have been in every respect the reverse of his father genius excepted  He was born in the year and received the rudiments of his education in a private school in Dublin When he was but eighteen years old his father who probably intended him for the ministry sent him to the university of Glasgow that he might finish his education there He had not been a year at the university till be fell in love with one Miss Atchenson the daughter of a tradesman in that city and was imprudent enough to interrupt his education by marrying her before he had entered into his th year  The natural extravagance of his temper soon exposed him to want and as he had now the additional charge of a wife his reduced circumstances obliged him to quit the university and go over with his wife who also carried a sister with her to Dublin where they relied upon the old gentleman for support His behaviour in this dependent state was the very reverse of what it should have been In place of directing his studies to some useful acquisition so as to support himself and family he spent his time in the most abject trifling and drew many heavy expences upon his father who had no other means of supporting himself than what his congregation afforded and a  small estate of fourscore pounds a year in Yorkshire  Considerations of prudence never entered into the heart of this unhappy young man who ran from one excess to another till an indulgent parent was reduced by his means to very great embarrassments Young Boyse was of all men the farthest removed from a gentleman he had no graces of person and fewer still of conversation To this cause it was perhaps owing that his wife naturally of a very volatile sprightly temper either grew tired of him or became enamour'd of variety It was however abundantly certain that she pursued intrigues with other men and what is still more surprising not without the knowledge of her husband who had either too abject a spirit to resent it or was bribed by some lucrative advantage to which he had a mind mean enough to stoop Though never were three people of more libertine characters than young Boyse his wife and sisterinlaw yet the two ladies wore such a mask of decency before the old gentleman that his fondness was never abated He hoped that time and experience would recover his son from his courses of extravagance and as he was of an unsuspecting temper he had not the least jea'ousy of the real conduct of his daughterinlaw who grew every day in his favour and continued to blind him by the seeming decency of her behaviour and a performance of those acts of piety he naturally expected from her But the old gentleman was deceived in his hopes for time made no alteration in his son The estate his father possessed in Yorkshire was sold to discharge his debts and when the old man lay in his last sickness he was entirely supported by presents from his congregation and buried at their expence  We have no farther account of Mr Boyse till we find him soon after his father's death at Edinburgh but from what motives he went there we cannot now  discover At this place his poetical genius raised him many friends and some patrons of very great eminence He published a volume of poems in to which is subjoined The Taolature of Cebes and a Letter upon Liberty inserted in the Dublin Journal and by these he obtained a very great reputation They are addressed to the countess of Eglington a lady of distinguished excellencies and so much celebrated for her beauty that it would be difficult for the best panegyrist to be too lavish in her praise This amiable lady was patroness of all men of wit and very much distinguished Mr Boyse while he resided in that country She was not however exempt from the lot of humanity and her conspicuous accomplishments were yet chequered with failings The chief of which was too high a consciousness of her own charms which inspired a vanity that sometimes betrayed her into errors  The following short anecdote was frequently related by Mr Boyse The countess one day came into the bedchamber of her youngest daughter then about years old while she was dressing at her toilet The countess observing the assiduity with which the young lady wanted to set off her person to the best advantage  'asked her what she would give to be as handsome as her mamma'  To which Miss replied  'As much as your ladyship would give to be as young as me'  This smart repartee which was at once pungent and witty very sensibly affected the countess who for the future was less lavish in praise of her own charms  Upon the death of the viscountess Stormont Mr Boyse wrote an Elegy which was very much applauded by her ladyship's relations This Elegy he intitled The Tears of the Muses as the deceased lady was a woman of the most refined taste in the sciences and a great admirer of poetry The lord  Stormont was so much pleased with this mark of esteem paid to the memory of his lady that he ordered a very handsome present to be given to Mr Boyse by his attorney at Edinburgh  Though Mr Boyse's name was very well known in that city  et his person was obscure for as he was altogether unsocial in his temper he had but few acquaintances and those of a cast much inferior to himself and with whom he ought to have been ashamed to associate It was some time before he could be found out and lord Stormont's kind intentions had been defeated if an advertisement had not been published in one of their weekly papers desiring the author of the Tears of the Muses to call at the house of the attorney  A Profession which in that City is denominated a Writer    The personal obscurity of Mr Boyse might perhaps not be altogether owing to his habits of gloominess and retirement Nothing is more difficult in that city than to make acquaintances There are no places where people meet and converse promiscuously There is a reservedness and gravity in the manner of the inhabitants which makes a stranger averse to approach them They naturally love solitude and are very slow in contracting friendships They are generous but it is with a bad grace They are strangers to affability and they maintain a haughtiness and an apparent indifference which deters a man from courting them They may be said to be hospitable but not complaisant to strangers Insincerity and cruelty have no existence amongst them but if they ought not to be hated they can never be much loved for they are incapable of insinuation and their ignorance of the world makes them unfit for entertaining sensible strangers They are publicspirited but torn to pieces by factions A gloominess in religion  renders one part of them very barbarous and an enthusiasm in politics so transports the genteeler part that they sacrifice to party almost every consideration of tenderness Among such a people a man may long live little known and less instructed for their reservedness renders them uncommunicative and their excessive haughtiness prevents them from being solicitous of knowledge  The Scots are far from being a dull nation they are lovers of pomp and shew but then there is an eternal stiffness a kind of affected dignity which spoils their pleasures Hence we have the less reason to wonder that Boyse lived obscurely at Edinburgh His extreme carelesness about his dress was a circumstance very inauspicious to a man who lives in that city They are such lovers of this kind of decorum that they will admit of no infringement upon it and were a man with more wit than Pope and more philosophy than Newton to appear at their market place negligent in his apparel he would be avoided by his acquaintances who would rather risk his displeasure than the censure of the public which would not fail to stigmatize them for associating with a man seemingly poor for they measure poverty and riches understanding or its opposite by exterior appearance They have many virtues but their not being polished prevents them from shining  The notice which lady Eglington and the lord Stormont took of our poet recommended him likewise to the patronage of the dutchess of Gordon who was a lady not only distinguished for her taste but cultivated a correspondence with some of the most eminent poets then living The dutchess was so zealous in Mr Boyse's affairs and so solicitous to raise him above necessity that she employed her interest in procuring the promise of a place for him She gave him a letter which he was next day to deliver to one of the commissioners of the customs  at Edinburgh It happened that he was then some miles distant from the city and the morning on which he was to have rode to town with her grace's letter of recommendation proved to be rainy This slender circumstance was enough to discourage Boyse who never looked beyond the present moment He declined going to town on account of the rainy weather and while he let slip the opportunity the place was bestowed upon another which the commissioner declared he kept for some time vacant in expectation of seeing a person recommended by the dutchess of Gordon  Of a man of this indolence os temper this sluggish meanness of spirit the reader cannot be surprised to find the suture conduct consist of a continued serious of blunders for he who had not spirit to prosecute an advantage put in his hands will neither bear distress with fortitude nor struggle to surmount it with resolution  Boyse at last having defeated all the kind intentions of his patrons towards him fell into a contempt and poverty which obliged him to quit Edinburgh as his creditors began to sollicit the payment of their debts with an earnestness not to be trifled with He communicated his design of going to London to the dutchess of Gordon who having still a very high opinion of his poetical abilities gave him a letter of recommendation to Mr Pope and obtained another for him to Sir Peter King the lord chancellor of England Lord Stormont recommended him to the sollicitorgeneral his brother and many other persons of the first fashion  Upon receiving these letters he with great caution quitted Edinburgh regretted by none but his creditors who were so exasperated as to threaten to prosecute him wherever he should be found But these menaces were never carried into execution perhaps from the consideration of his indigence  which afforded no probable prospect of their being paid  Upon his arrival in London he went to Twickenham in order to deliver the dutchess of Gordon's letter to Mr Pope but that gentleman not being at home Mr Boyse never gave himself the trouble to repeat his visit nor in all probability would Pope have been overfond of him as there was nothing in his conversation which any wise indicated the abilities he possessed He frequently related that he was graciously received by Sir Peter King dined at his table and partook of his pleasures But this relation they who knew Mr Boyse well never could believe for he was so abject in his disposition that he never could look any man in the face whose appearance was better than his own nor likely had courage to sit at Sir Peter King's table where every one was probably his superior He had no power of maintaining the dignity of wit and though his understanding was very extensive yet but a few could discover that he had any genius above the common rank This want of spirit produced the greatest part of his calamities because he knew not how to avoid them by any vigorous effort of his mind He wrote poems but those though excellent in their kind were lost to the world by being introduced with no advantage He had so strong a propension to groveling that his acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him and those in higher life he addressed by letters not having sufficient confidence or politeness to converse familiarly with them a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius Thus unfit to support himself in the world he was exposed to variety of distress from which he could invent no means of extricating himself but by writing mendicant letters It will appear amazing but impartiality obliges us to relate it that this man of so abject a spirit was voluptuous  and luxurious He had no taste for any thing elegant and yet was to the last degree expensive Can it be believed that often when he had received half a guinea in consequence of a supplicating letter he would go into a tavern order a supper to be prepared drink of the richest wines and spend all the money that had just been given him in charity without having any one to participate the regale with him and while his wife and child were starving home This is an instance of base selfishness for which no name is as yet invented and except by another poet  Savage  with some variation of circumstances was perhaps never practised by the most sensual epicure  He had yet some friends many of the most eminent dissenters who from a regard to the memory of his father afforded him supplies from time to time Mr Boyse by perpetual applications at last exhausted their patience and they were obliged to abandon a man on whom their liberality was ill bestowed as it produced no other advantage to him than a few days support when he returned again with the same necessities  The epithet of cold has often been given to charity perhaps with a great deal of truth but if any thing can warrant us to withhold our charity it is the consideration that its purposes are prostituted by those on whom it is bestowed  We have already taken notice of the infidelity of his wife and now her circumstances were reduced her virtue did not improve She fell into a way of life disgraceful to the sex nor was his behaviour in any degree more moral They were frequently covered with ignominy reproaching one another for the acquisition of a disease which both deserved because mutually guilty  It was about the year that Mr Boyse reduced to the last extremity of human wretchedness  had not a shirt a coat or any kind of apparel to put on the sheets in which he lay were carried to the pawnbroker's and he was obliged to be confined to bed with no other covering than a blanket He had little support but what he got by writing letters to his friends in the most abject stile He was perhaps ashamed to let this instance of distress be known to his friends which might be the occasion of his remaining six weeks in that situation During this time he had some employment in writing verses for the Magazines and whoever had seen him in his study must have thought the object singular enough He sat up in bed with the blanket wrapt about him through which he had cut a hole large enough to admit his arm and placing the paper upon his knee scribbled in the best manner he could the verses he was obliged to make Whatever he got by those or any of his begging letters was but just sufficient for the preservation of life And perhaps he would have remained much longer in this distressful state had not a compassionate gentleman upon hearing this circumstance related ordered his cloaths to be taken out of pawn and enabled him to appear again abroad  This six weeks penance one would imagine sufficient to deter him for the future from suffering himself to be exposed to such distresses but by a long habit of want it grew familiar to him and as he had less delicacy than other men he was perhaps less afflicted with his exterior meanness For the future whenever his distresses so press'd as to induce him to dispose of his shirt he fell upon an artificial method of supplying one He cut some white paper in slips which he tyed round his wrists and in the same manner supplied his neck In this plight he frequently appeared abroad with the additional inconvenience of want of breeches  He was once sent for in a hurry to the house of a printer who had employed him to write a poem for his Magazine Boyse then was without breeches or waistcoat but was yet possessed of a coat which he threw upon him and in this ridiculous manner went to the printer's house where he found several women whom his extraordinary appearance obliged immediately to retire  He fell upon many strange schemes of raising t  isting sums He sometimes ordered his wife to i  form people that he was just expiring and by this artifice work upon their compassion and many of his friends were frequently surprised to meet the man in the street to day to whom they had yesterday sent  lief as to a person on the verge of death At other times he would propose subscriptions for poems of which only the beginning and conclusion were written and by this expedient would relieve some present necessity But as he seldom was able to put any of his poems to the press his veracity in th  s particular suffered a diminution and indeed in almost every other particular he might justly be suspected for if he could but gratify an immediate appe  ite he cared not at what expence whether of the reputation or purse of another  About the year Mr Boyse's wife died He was then at Reading and pretended much concern when he heard of her death  It was an affectation in Mr Boyse to appear very fond of a little lapdog which he always carried about with him in his arms imagining it gave him the air of a man of taste Boyse whose circumstances were then too mean to put himself in mourning was yet resolved that some part of his family should He step'd into a little shop purchased half a yard of black ribbon which he fixed round his dog's neck by way of mourning for the loss of its mistress But this was not the only ridiculous instance  of his behaviour on the death of his wife Such was the sottishness of this man that when he was in liquor he always indulged a dream of his wife's being still alive and would talk very spightfully of those by whom he suspected she was entertained This he never mentioned however except in his cups which was only as often as he had money to spend The manner of his becoming intoxicated was very particular As he had no spirit to keep g  od company so he retired to some obscu  e alehouse and regaled himself with hot twopenny which though he drank in very great quantities yet he had never more than a pennyworth at a timeSuch a practice rendered him so compleatly sottish that even his abilities as an author became sensibly impaired  We have already mentioned his being at Reading His business there was to compile a Review of the most material transactions at home and abroad during the last war in which he has included a short account of the late rebellion For this work by which he got some reputation he was paid by the sheet a price sufficient to keep him from starving and that was all To such distress must that man be driven who is destitute of prudence to direct the efforts of his genius In this work Mr Boyse discovers how capable he was of the most irksome and laborious employment when he maintained a power over his appetites and kept hims  free from intemperance  While he remained at Reading he addressed by supplicating letters two Irish noblemen lord Kenyston and lord Kingstand who resided in Berkshire and received some money from them he also met with another gentleman there of a benevolent disposition who from the knowledge he had of the father pitied the distresses of the son and by his interest with some eminent Dissenters in those parts raised a sufficient sum to cloath him  for the abjectness of his appearance secluded our poet even from the table of his Printer  During his abode at Reading an accident had like to have put an end to his follies and his life together for he had the illluck to fall from his garret down the whole flight of stairs but being destined to lengthen out a useless life for some time longer he escaped with only a severe bruising    Upon his return from Reading his behaviour was more decent than it had ever been before and there were some hopes that a reformation tho' late would be wrought upon him He was employed by a Bookseller to translate Fenelon on the Existence of God during which time he married a second wife a woman in low circumstances but well enough adapted to his taste He began now to live with more regard to his character and support a better appearance than usual but while his circumstances were mending and his irregular appetites losing ground his health visibly declined he had the satisfaction while in this lingering illness to observe a poem of his entitled The Deity recommended by two eminent writers the ingenious Mr Fielding and the rev Mr James Harvey author of The Meditations The former in the beginning of his humorous History of Tom Jones calls it an excellent poem Mr Harvey stiles it a pious and instructive piece and that worthy gentleman upon hearing that the author was in necessitous circumstances deposited two guineas in the hands of a trusty person to be given him whenever his occasions should press This poem was written some years before Mr Harvey or Mr Fielding took any notice of it but it was lost to the public as the reputation of the Bookseller consisted in sending into the world abundance of trifles amongst which it was considered as one Mr Boyse said that upon its first publication a gentleman acquainted with Mr Pope took occasion to ask that poet if he was not the  author of it to which Mr Pope replied  'that he was not the author but that there were many lines in it of which he should not be ashamed'  This Mr Boyse considered as a very great compliment The poem indeed abounds with shining lines and elevated sentiments on the several Attributes of the Supreme Being but then it is without a plan or any connexion of parts for it may be read either backwards or forwards as the reader pleases  While Mr Boyse was in this lingering illness he seemed to have no notion of his approaching end nor did he expect it 'till it was almost past the thinking of His mind indeed was often religiously disposed he frequently talked upon that subject and probably suffered a great deal from the remorse of his conscience The early impressions of his good education were never entirely obliterated and his whole life was a continued struggle between his will and reason as he was always violating his duty to the one while he fell under the subjection of the other It was in consequence of this war in his mind that he wrote a beautiful poem called The Recantation  In the month of May he died in obscure lodgings near ShoeLane An old acquaintance of his endeavoured to collect money to defray the expences of his funeral so that the scandal of being buried by the parish might be avoided But his endeavours were in vain for the persons he sollicited had been so troubled with applications during the life of this unhappy man that they refused to contribute any thing towards his funeral The remains of this son of the muses were with very little ceremony hurried away by the parish officers and thrown amongst common beggars though with this distinction that the service of the church was performed over his corpse Never was an exit more shocking nor a life spent with less grace than those of Mr Boyse  and never were such distinguished abilities given to less purpose His genius was not confined to poetry only he had a taste for painting music and heraldry with the latter of which he was very well acquainted His poetical pieces if collected would make six moderate volumes Many of them are seattered in the Gentleman's Magazine marked with the letter Y and Alceus Two volumes were published in London but as they never had any great sale it will be difficult to find them  An ode of his in the manner of Spenser entitled The Olive was addresied to Sir Robert Walpole which procured him a present of ten guineas He translated a poem from the High Dutch of Van Haren in praise of peace upon the conclusion of that made at Aix la Chapelle but the poem which procured him the greatest reputation was that upon the Attributes of the Deity of which we have already taken notice He was employed by Mr Ogle to translate some of Chaucer's Tales into modern English which he performed with great spirit and received at the rate of three pence a line for this trouble Mr Ogle published a complete edition of that old poet's Canterbury Tales Modernized and Mr Boyse's name is put to such Tales as were done by him It had often been urged to Mr Boyse to turn his thoughts towards the drama as that was the most profitable kind of poetical writing and as many a poet of inferior genius to him has raised large contributions on the public by the success of their plays But Boyse never seemed to relish this proposal perhaps from a consciousness that he had not spirit to prosecute the arduous task of introducing it on the stage or that he thought himself unequal to the task  In the year Mr Boyse published without his name an Ode on the ba  tle of Dettingen entitled Al  ion's Triumph some Stanza's of which we shall give as a specimen of Mr Boyse's poetry  STANZA's from ALBION's Triumph  XIII  But how blest sovereign shall th' unpractis'd muse  These recent honours of thy reign rehearse  How to thy virtues turn her dazzled views  Or consecrate thy deeds in equal verse  Amidst the field of horrors wide display'd  How paint the calm  The King gave his orders with the utmost calmness tho' no body was more expos'd  that smil'd upon thy brow  Or speak that thought which every part surveyed  ' Directing where the rage of war should glow'  Inspir'd repuls'd battalions to engage  And taught the doubtful battle where to rage  Mr Addison's Campaign  While watchful angels hover'd round thy head  And victory on high the palm of glory spread  XIV  Nor royal youth reject the artless praise  Which due to worth like thine the Muse bestows  Who with prophetic extasy surveys  These early wreaths of fame adorn thy brows  Aspire like Nassau in the glorious strife  Keep thy great sires' examples full in eye  But oh for Britain's sake consult a life  The noblest triumphs are too mean to buy  And while you purchase glorybear in mind  A prince's truest fame is to protect mankind  XV  Alike in arts and arms acknowledg'd great  Let Stair accept the lays he once could own  Nor Carteret thou the column of the state  The friend of science on the labour frown  Nor shall unjust to foreign worth the Muse  In silence Austria's valiant chiefs conceal  While Aremberg's heroic line she views  And Neiperg's conduct strikes even envy pale  Names Gallia yet shall further learn to fear  And Britain grateful still shall treasure up as dear  XIX  But oh acknowledg'd victor in the field  What thanks dread sovereign shall thy toils reward  Such honours as delivered nations yield  Such for thy virtues justly stand prepar'd  When erst on Oudenarde's decisive plain  Before thy youth the Gaul defeated fled  The eye of fate  His Majesty early distinguished himself as a volunteer at the battle of Oudenarde in  foresaw on distant Maine  The laurels now that shine around thy head  Oh should entwin'd with these fresh Olives bloom  Thy Triumphs then would shame the pride of antient Rome  XX  Mean time while from this fair event we shew  That British valour happily survives  And cherish'd by the king's propitious view  The rising plant of glory sweetly thrives  Let all domestic faction learn to cease  Till humbled Gaul no more the world alarms  Till GEORGE procures to Europe solid peace  A peace secur'd by his victorious arms  And binds in iron fetters ear to ear  Ambition Rapine Havock and Despair  With all the ghastly fiends of desolating war  Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE  THIS eminent poet and physician was son of Mr Robert Blackmore an Attorney at Law He received his early education at a private country school from whence in the th year of his age he was removed to Westminster and in a short time after to the university of Oxford where he continued thirteen years  In the early period of our author's life he was a Schoolmaster as appears by a satirical copy of verses Dr Drake wrote against him consisting of upwards of forty lines of which the following are very pungent  By nature form'd by want a pedant made  Blackmore at first set up the whipping trade  Next quack commenc'd then fierce with pride he swore  That toothach gout and corns should be no more  In vain his drugs as well as birch he tried  His boys grew blockheads and his patients died  Some circumstances concurring it may be presumed in Sir Richard's favour he travelled into Italy and at Padua took his degrees in physic  Jacob    He gratified his curiosity in visiting France Germany and the Low Countries and after spending a year and a half in this delightful exercise he returned to England As Mr Blackmore had made physic his chief study so he repaired to  London to enter upon the practice of it and no long after he was chosen fellow of the Royal College of Physicians by the charter of King James II Sir Richard had seen too much of foreign slavery to be fond of domestic chains and therefore early declared himself in favour of the revolution and espoused those principles upon which it was effected This zeal recommended him to King William and in the year he was sworn one of his physicians in ordinary He was honoured by that Prince with a gold medal and chain was likewise knighted by him and upon his majesty's death was one of those who gave their opinion in the opening of the king's body Upon Queen Anne's accession to the throne he was appointed one of her physicians and continued so for some time  This gentleman is author of more original poems of a considerable length besides a variety of other works than can well be conceived could have been composed by one man during the longest period of human life He was a chaste writer he struggled in the cause of virtue even in those times when vice had the countenance of the great and when an almost universal degeneracy prevailed He was not afraid to appear the advocate of virtue in opposition to the highest authority and no lustre of abilities in his opponents could deter him from stripping vice of those gaudy colours with which poets of the first eminence had cloathed her  An elegant writer having occasion to mention the state of wit in the reign of King Charles II characterizes the poets in the following manner  The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame  Nor sought for Johnson's art nor Shakespear's flame  Themselves they studied as they lived they writ  Intrigue was p  ot obscenity was wit  Their cause was gen'ral their supports were strong  Their slaves were willing and their reign was long  Mr Pope somewhere says  Unhappy Drydenin all Charles's days  Roscommon only boasts unspotted lays  He might likewise have excepted Blackmore who was not only chaste in his own writings but endeavoured to correct those who prostituted the gifts of heaven to the inglorious purposes of vice and folly and he was at least as good a poet as Roscommon  Sir Richard had by the freedom of his censures on the libertine writers of his age incurred the heavy displeasure of Dryden who takes all opportunities to ridicule him and somewhere says that he wrote to the rumbling of his chariot wheels And as if to be at enmity with Blackmore had been hereditary to our greatest poets we find Mr Pope taking up the quarrel where Dryden left it and persecuting this worthy man with yet a severer degree of satire Blackmore had been informed by Curl that Mr Pope was the author of a Travestie on the first Psalm which he takes occasion to reprehend in his Essay on Polite Learning vol ii p He ever considered it as the disgrace of genius that it should be employed to burlesque any of the sacred compositions which as they speak the language of inspiration tend to awaken the soul to virtue and inspire it with a sublime devotion Warmed in this honourable cause he might perhaps suffer his zeal to transport him to a height which his enemies called enthusiasm but of the two extremes no doubt can be made that Blackmore's was the safest and even dullness in favour of virtue which by the way was not the case with Sir Richard is more tolerable than the brightest  parts employed in the cause of lewdness and debauchery  The poem for which Sir Richard had been most celebrated was undoubtedly his Creation now deservedly become a classic We cannot convey a more amiable idea of this great production than in the words of Mr Addison in his Spectator Nuumber who after having criticised on that book of Milton which gives an account of the Works of Creation thus proceeds  'I cannot conclude this book upon the Creation without mentioning a poem which has lately appeared under that title The work was undertaken with so good an intention and executed with so great a mastery that it deserves to be looked upon as one of the most useful and noble productions in our English verse The reader cannot but be pleased to find the depths of philosophy enlivened with all the charms of poetry and to see so great a strength of reason amidst so beautiful a redundancy of the imagination The author has shewn us that design in all the works of nature which necessarily leads us to the knowledge of its first cause In short he has illustrated by numberless and incontestable instances that divine wisdom which the son of Sirach has so nobly ascribed to the Supreme Being in his formation of the world when he tells us that he  created her and saw her and numbered her and poured her out upon all his works  '  The design of this excellent poem is to demonstrate the selfexistence of an eternal mind from the created and dependent existence of the universe and to confute the hypothefis of the Epicureans and the Fatalists under whom all the patrons of impiety ancient and modern of whatsoever denomination may be ranged The first of whom affirm the world was in time caused by  chance and the other that it existed from eternity without a cause 'Tis true both these acknowledge the existence of Gods but by their absurd and ridiculous description of them it is plain they had nothing else in view but to avoid the obnoxious character of atheistical philosophers To adorn this poem no embellishments are borrowed from the exploded and obsolete theology of the ancient idolaters of Greece and Rome no rapturous invocations are addressed to their idle deities nor any allusions to their fabulous actions  'I have more than once says Sir Richard publicly declared my opinion that a Christian poet cannot but appear monstrous and ridiculous in a Pagan dress That though it should be granted that the Heathen religion might be allowed a place in light and loose songs mock heroic and the lower lyric compositions yet in Christian poems of the sublime and greater kind a mixture of the Pagan theology must by all who are masters of reflexion and good sense be condemned if not as impious at least as impertinent and absurd And this is a truth so clear and evident that I make no doubt it will by degrees force its way and prevail over the contrary practice Should Britons recover their virtue and reform their taste they could no more bear the Heathen religion in verse than in prose Christian poets as well as Christian preachers the business of both being to instruct the people though the last only are wholly appropriated to it should endeavour to confirm and spread their own religion If a divine should begin his sermon with a solemn prayer to Bacchus or Apollo to Mars or Venus what would the people think of their preacher and is it not as really though not equally absurd for a poet in a great and serious poem wherein he celebrates some wonderful and happy  event of divine providence or magnifies the illustrious instrument that was honoured to bring the event about to address his prayer to false deities and cry for help to the abominations of the heathen'  Mr Gildon in his Compleat Art of Poetry after speaking of our author in the most respectful terms says  'that notwithstanding his merit this admirable author did not think himself upon the same footing with Homer'  But how different is the judgment of Mr Dennis who in this particular opposes his friend Mr Gildon  'Blackmore's action says he has neither unity integrity morality nor universality and consequently he can have no fable and no heroic poem His narration is neither probable delightful nor wonderful His characters have none of these necessary qualificationsThe things contained in his narrations are neither in their own nature delightful nor numerous enough nor rightly disposed nor surprizing nor pathetic'  nay he proceeds so far as to say Sir Richard has no genius first establishing it as a principle  'That genius is known by a furious joy and pride of soul on the conception of an extraordinary hint Many men says he have their hints without these motions of fury and pride of soul because they want fire enough to agitate their spirits and these we call cold writers Others who have a great deal of fire but have not excellent organs feel the fore mentioned motions without the extraordinary hints and these we call fustian writers'  And he declares that Sir Richard hath neither the hints nor the motions  Preface to Remarks on Prince Arthur octavo  But Dennis has not contented himself with charging Blackmore with want of genius but has likewise the following  remarks to prove him a bad Church of England man These are his words  'All Mr Blackmore's coelestial machines as they cannot be defended so much as by common received opinion so are they directly contrary to the doctrine of the church of England that miracles had ceased a long time before prince Arthur come into the world Now if the doctrine of the church of England be true as we are obliged to believe then are all the coelestial machines of prince Arthur unsufferable as wanting not only human but divine probability But if the machines are sufferable that is if they have so much as divine probability then it follows of necessity that the doctrine of the church is false so that I leave it to every impartial clergyman to consider'  If no greater objection could be brought against Blackmore's Prince Arthur than those raised by Mr Dennis the Poem would be faultless fo  what has the doctrine of the church of England to do with an epic poem It is not the doctrine of the church of England to suppose that the apostate spirits put the power of the Almighty to proof by openly resisting his will and maintaining an obstinate struggle with the angels commissioned by him to drive them from the mansions of the bless'd or that they attempted after their perdition to recover heaven by violence These are not the doctrines of the church of England but they are conceived in a true spirit of poetry and furnish those tremendous descriptions with which Milton has enriched his Paradise Lost  Whoever has read Mr Dryden's ded  cation of his Juvenal will there perceive that in that great man's opinion coelestial machines might with the utmost propriety be introduced in an Epic Poem built upon a christian model but at the same time he adds  'The guardian angels of states and kingdoms are not to be managed by a vulgar hand'  Perhaps it may be true that the guardian angels of states and kingdoms may have been too powerful for the conduct of Sir Richard Blackmore but he has had at least the merit of paving the way and has set an example how Epic Poems may be written upon the principles of christianity and has enjoyed a comfort of which no bitterness or raillery can deprive him namely the virtuous intention of doing good and as he himself expresses it  'of rescuing the Muses from the hands of ravishers and restoring them again to their chaste and pure mansions'  Sir Richard Blackmore died on the th of October in an advanced age and left behind him the character of a worthy man a great poet and a friend to religion Towards the close of his life his business as a physician declined but as he was a man of prudent conduct it is not to be supposed that he was subjected to any want by that accident for in his earlier years he was considered amongst the first in his profession and his practice was consequently very extensive  The decay of his employment might partly be owing to old age and infirmities which rendered him less active than before and partly to the diminution his character might suffer by the eternal war which the wits waged against him who spared neither bitterness nor calumny and perhaps Sir Richard may be deemed the only poet who ever s  ffered for having too much religion and morality  The fo  lowing is the most accurate account we could obtain of his writings which for the sake of distinction we have divided into classes by which the reader may discern how various and numerous his compositions areTo have written so much upon so great a variety of subjects and to have written nothing contemptibly must indicate a genius much superior to the common standardHis versification is almost every where beautiful and tho'  he has been ridiculed in the Treatise of the Bathos published in Pope's works for being too minute in his descriptions of the objects of nature yet it rather proceeded from a philosophical exactness than a penury of genius  It is really astonishing to find Dean Swift joining issue with less religious wits in laughing at Blackmore's works of which he makes a ludicrous detail since they were all written in the cause of virtue which it was the Dean's business more immediately to support as on this account he enjoy'd his preferment But the Dean perhaps was one of those characters who chose to sacrifice his cause to his joke This was a treatment Sir Richard could never have expected at the hands of a clergyman  A LIST of Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE'S Works  THEOLOGICAL  I Just Prejudices against the Arian

philosophical Poem on the Creation In his second Book he demonstrates the existence of a God from the wisdom and design which appears in the motions of the heavenly orbs but more particularly in the solar system First in the situation of the Sun and its due distance from the earth The fatal consequences of its having been placed otherwise than it is Secondly he considers its diurnal motion whence the change of the day and night proceeds which we shall here insert as a specimen of the elegant versisication and sublime energy of this Poem  Next see Lucretian Sages see the Sun  His course diurnal and his annual run  How in his glorious race he moves along  Gay as a bridegroom as a giant strong  How his unweari'd labour he repeats  Returns at morning and at eve retreats  And by the distribution of his light  Now gives to man the day and now the night  Night when the drowsy swain and trav'ler cease  Their daily toil and sooth their limbs with ease  When all the weary sons of woe restrain  Their yielding cares with slumber's silken chain  Solace sad grief and lull reluctant pain  And while the sun ne'er covetous of rest  Flies with such rapid speed from east to west  In tracks oblique he thro' the zodiac rolls  Between the northern and the southern poles  From which revolving progress thro' the skies  The needful seasons of the year arise  And as he now advances now retreats  Whence winter colds proceed and summer heats  He qualifies and chears the air by turns  Which winter freezes and which summer burns  Thus his kind rays the two extremes reduce  And keep a temper fit for nature's use  The frost and drought by this alternate pow'r  The earth's prolific energy restore  The lives of man and beast demand the change  Hence fowls the air and fish the ocean range  Of heat and cold this just successive reign  Which does the balance of the year maintain  The gard'ner's hopes and farmer's patience props  Gives vernal verdure and autumnal crops  Mr JAMES THOMSON  THIS celebrated poet from whom his country has derived the most distinguished honour was son of the revd Mr Thomson a minister of the church of Scotland in the Presbytery of Jedburgh  He was born in the place where his father was minister about the beginning of the present century and received the rudiments of his education at a private country school Mr Thomson in the early part of his life so far from appearing to possess a sprightly genius was considered by his schoolmaster and those which directed his education as being really without a common share of parts  While he was improving himself in the Latin and Greek tongues at this country school he often visited a minister whose charge lay in the same presbytery with his father's the revd Mr Ricker on a man of such amazing powers that many persons of genius as well as Mr Thomson who conversed with him have been astonished that such great merit should be buried in an obscure part of the country where he had no opportunity to display himself and except upon periodical meetings of the ministers seldom an opportunity of conversing with men of learning  Though Mr Thomson's schoolmaster could not discover that he was endowed with a common portion of understanding yet Mr Rickerton was not so blind to his genius he distinguished our author's early propension to poetry and had once in his hands some of the first attempts Mr Thomson ever made in that province  It is not to be doubted but our young poet greatly improved while he continued to converse with Mr Rickerton who as he was a philosophical man inspired his mind with a love of the sciences nor were the revd gentleman's endeavours in vain for Mr Thomson has shewn in his works how well he was acquainted with natural and moral philosophy a circumstance which perhaps is owing to the early impressions he received from Mr Rickerton  Nature which delights in diversifying her gifts does not bestow upon every one a power of displaying the abilities she herself has granted to the best advantage Though Mr Rickerton could discover that Mr Thomson so far from being without parts really possessed a very fine genius yet he never could have imagined as he often declared that there existed in his mind such powers as even by the best cultivation could have raised him to so high a degree of eminence amongst the poets  When Mr Rickerton first saw Mr Thomson's Winter which was in a Bookseller's shop at Edinburgh he stood amazed and after he had read the lines quoted below he dropt the poem from his hand in the extasy of admiration The lines are his induction to Winter  ter than which few poets ever rose to a more sublime height  See winter comes to rule the varied year  Sullen and sad with all his rising train  Vapours and storms and clouds be these my theme  These that exalt the soul to solemn thought  And heav'nly musing welcome kindred glooms  Congenial horrors hailwith frequent foot  Oft have I in my pleasing calm of life  When nurs'd by careless solitude I liv'd  Oft have I wander'd thro' your rough domain  Trod the pure virgin snows my self as pure  Heard the winds blow or the big torrents burst  Or seen the deep fermenting tempest brew'd  In the red evening sky Thus pass'd the time  'Till from the lucid chambers of the south  Look'd out the joyous spring look'd out and smil'd    After spending the usual time at a country school in the acquisition of the dead languages Mr Thomson was removed to the university of Edinburgh in order to finish his education and be fitted for the ministry Here as at the country school he made no great figure his companions thought contemptuously of him and the masters under whom he studied had not a higher opinion of our poet's abilities than their pupils His course of attendance upon the classes of philosophy being finished he was entered in the Divinity Hall as one of the candidates for the ministry where the students before they are permitted to enter on their probation must yield six years attendance  It was in the second year of Mr Thomson's attendance upon this school of divinity whose professor at that time was the revd and learned Mr William Hamilton a person whom he always mentioned with respect that our author was appointed by the professor to write a discourse on the Power of the Supreme Being When his companions  heard their task assigned him they could not but arraign the professor's judgment for assigning so copious a theme to a young man from whom nothing equal to the subject could be expected But when Mr Thomson delivered the discourse they had then reason to reproach themselves for want of discernment and for indulging a contempt of one superior to the brightest genius amongst them This discourse was so sublimely elevated that both the professor and the students who heard it delivered were astonished It was written in blank verse for which Mr Hamilton rebuked him as being improper upon that occasion Such of his fellowstudents as envied him the success of this discourse and the admiration it procured him employed their industry to trace him as a plagiary for they could not be persuaded that a youth  eemingly so much removed from the appearance of genius could compose a declamation in which learning genius and judgment had a very great share Their search however proved fruitless and Mr Thomson continued while he remained at the university to possess the honour of that discourse without any diminution  We are not certain upon what account it was that Mr Thomson dropt the notion of going into the ministry perhaps he imagined it a way of life too severe for the freedom of his disposition probably he declined becoming a presbyterian minister from a consciousness of his own genius which gave him a right to entertain more ambitious views for it seldom happens that a man of great parts can be content with obscurity or the low income of sixty pounds a year in some retired corner of a neglected country which must have been the lot  of Thomson if he had not extended his views beyond the sphere of a minister of the established church of Scotland  After he had dropt all thoughts of the clerical profession he began to be more sollicitous of distinguishing his genius as he placed some dependence upon it and hoped to acquire such patronage as would enable him to appear in life with advantage But the part of the world where he then was could not be very auspicious to such hopes for which reason he began to turn his eyes towards the grand metropolis  The first poem of Mr Thomson's which procured him any reputation from the public was his Winter of which mention is already made and further notice will be taken but he had private approbation for several of his pieces long before his Winter was published or before he quitted his native country He wrote a Paraphrase on the th Psalm which after it had received the approbation of Mr Rickerton he permitted his friends to copy By some means or other this Paraphrase fell into the hands of Mr Auditor Benson who expressing his admiration of it said that he doubted not if the author was in London but he would meet with encouragement equal to his merit This observation of Benson's was communicated to Thomson by a letter and no doubt had its natural influence in inflaming his heart and hastening his journey to the metropolis He soon set out for Newcastle where he took shipping and landed at Billinsgate When he arrived it was his immediate care to wait on  Mr Mallet was his quondam schoolfellow but much his junior they contracted an early intimacy which improved with their years nor was it ever once disturbed by any casual mistake  n  y or jealousy on either side a proof that two writers of merit may agree in spite of the common observation to the contrary  Mr Mallet who then lived in HanoverSquare  in the character of tutor to his grace the duke of Montrose and his late brother lord G Graham Before Mr Thomson reached HanoverSquare an accident happened to him which as it may divert some of our readers we shall here insert He had received letters of recommendation from a gentleman of rank in Scotland to some persons of distinction in London which he had carefully tied up in his pockethandkerchief As he sauntered along the streets he could not withhold his admiration of the magnitude opulence and various objects this great metropolis continually presented to his view These must naturally have diverted the imagination of a man of less reflexion and it is not greatly to be wondered at if Mr Thomson's mind was so ingrossed by these new presented scenes as to be absent to the busy crowds around him He often stopped to gratify his curiosity the consequences of which he afterwards experienced With an honest simplicity of heart unsuspecting as unknowing of guilt he was ten times longer in reaching HanoverSquare than one less sensible and curious would have been When he arrived he found he had paid for his curiosity his pocket was picked of his handkerchief and all the letters that were wrapped up in it This accident would have proved very mortifying to a man less philosophical than Thomson but he was of a temper never to be agitated he then smiled at it and frequently made his companions laugh at the relation  It is natural to suppose that as soon as Mr Thomson arrived in town he shewed to some of his friends his poem on Winter  The Winter was first wrote in detached pieces or occasional descriptions it was by the advice of Mr Mallet they were collected and made into one connected piece This was finished the first of all the seasons and was the first poem he published By the farther advice and at the earnest request of Mr Mallet he wrote the other three seasons  The approbation  it might meet with from them was not however a sufficient recommendation to introduce it to the world He had the mortification of offering it to several Booksellers without success who perhaps not being qualified themselves to judge of the merit of the performance refused to r  sque the necessary expences on the work of an obscure stranger whose name could be no recommendation to it These were severe repulses but at last the difficulty was surmounted Mr Mallet offered it to Mr Millan now Bookseller at CharingCross who without making any scruples printed it For some time Mr Millan had reason to believe that he should be a lose  by his frankness for the impression lay like as paper on his hands few copies being sold 'till by an accident its merit was discovered  Though 'tis possible this piece might be offered to more Printers who could read than could taste nor is it very surprizing that an unknown author might meet with a difficulty of this sort since an eager desire to peruse a new piece with a fashionable name to it shall in one day occasion the sale of thousands of what may never reach a second edition while a work that has only its intrinsic merit to depend on may lie long dormant in a Bookseller's shop 'till some person eminent for taste points out its worth to the many declares the bullion sterling stamps its value with his name and makes it pass current with the world Such was the fate of Thomson at this juncture Such heretofore was Milton's whose works were only found in the libraries of the curious or judicious few 'till Addison's remarks spread a taste for them and at length it became even unfashionable not to have read them  One Mr Whatley a man of some taste in letters but perfectly enthusiastic in the admiration of any thing which pleased him happened to cast his eye upon it and finding something which delighted him perused the whole not without growing astonishment that the poem should be unknown and the author obscure He learned from the Bookseller the circumstances already mentioned  and in the extasy of his admiration of this poem he went from Coffeehouse to Coffeehouse pointing out its beauties and calling upon all men of taste to exert themselves in rescuing one of the greatest geniuses that ever appeared from obscurity This had a very happy effect for in a short time the impression was bought up and they who read the poem had no reason to complain of Mr Whatley's exaggeration for they found it so compleatly beautiful that they could not but think themselves happy in doing justice to a man of so much merit  The poem of Winter is perhaps the most finished as well as most picturesque of any of the Four Seasons The scenes are grand and lively It is in that season that the c  tion appears in distress and nature assumes a melancholy air and an imagination so poetical as Thomson's could not but furnish those awful and striking images which siil the soul with a solemn dread of  those Vapours and Storms and Clouds  he has so well painted Description is the peculiar talent of Thomson we tremble at his thunder in summer we shiver with his winter's cold and we rejoice at the renovation of nature by the sweet influence of spring But the poem deserves a further illustration and we shall take an opportunity of pointing out some of its most striking beauties but before we speak of these we beg leave to relate the following anecdote  As soon as Winter was published Mr Thomson sent a copy of it as a present to Mr Joseph Mitchell his countryman and brother poet who not liking many parts of it inclosed to him the following couplet  Beauties and faults so thick lye scattered here  Those I could read if these were not so near  To this Mr Thomson answered extempore  Why all not faults injurious Mitchell why  Appears one beauty to thy blasted eye  Damnation worse than thine if worse can be  Is all I ask and all I want from thee  Upon a friend's remonstrating to Mr Thomson that the expression of blasted eye would look like a personal reflexion as Mr Mitchell had really that misfortune he changed the epithet blasted into blasting But to return  After our poet has represented the influence of Winter upon the face of nature and particularly described the severities of the frost he has the following beautiful transition  Our infant winter sinks  Divested of its grandeur should our eye  Astonish'd shoot into the f  igid zone  Where for relentless months continual night  Holds o'er the glitt'ring waste her starry reign  There thro' the prison of unbounded wilds  arr'd by the hand of nature from escape  Wide roams the Russian exile Nought around  Strikes his sad eye but desarts lost in snow  And heavy loaded groves and solid floods  That stretch athwart the solitary waste  Their icy horrors to the frozen main  And chearless towns far distant never bless'd  Save when its annual course the caravan  Bends to the golden coast of rich Cathay  The old name of China  With news of humankind Yet there life glows  Yet cherished there beneath the shining waste  The furry nations harbour tipt with jet  Fair ermines spotless as the snows they press  Sables of glossy black and dark embrown'd  Or beauteous streak'd with many a mingled hue  Thousands besides the costly pride of courts  The description of a thaw is equally picturesque The following lines consequent upon it are excellent  Those sullen seas  That wash th' ungenial pole will rest no more  Beneath the shackles of the mighty North  But rousing all their waves resistless heave  And hark the lengthen'd roar continuous runs  Athwart the refted deep at once it bursts  And piles a thousand mountains to the clouds  Ill fares the bark with trembling wretches charg'd  That tost amid the floating fragments moors  Beneath the shelter of an icy isle  While night o'erwhelms the sea and horror looks  More horrible Can human force endure  Th' assembled mischiefs that besiege 'em round  Heartgnawing hunger fainting weariness  The roar of winds and waves the crush of ice  Now ceasing now renew'd with louder rage  And in dire ecchoes bellowing round the main  As the induction of Mr Thomson's Winter has been celebrated for its sublimity so the conclusion has likewise a claim to praise for the tenderness of the sentiments and the pathetic force of the expression  'Tis doneDread winter spreads her latest glooms  And reigns tremendous o'er the conquer'd year  How dead the vegetable kingdom lies  How dumb the tuneful horror wide extends  Her desolate domain Behold fond man  See here thy pictur'd life pass some few years  Thy flow'ring spring thy summer's ardent strength  Thy sober autumn fading into age  And pale concluding winter comes at last  And shuts the scene  He concludes the poem by enforcing a reliance on providence which will in proper time compensate for all those seeming severities with which good men are often oppressed  Ye good distrest  Ye noble few who here unbending stand  Beneath life's pressure yet bear up awhile  And what your bounded view which only saw  A little part deemed evil is no more  The storms of Wintry time will quickly pass  And one unbounded Spring encircle all  The poem of Winter meeting with such general applause Mr Thomson was induced to write the other three seasons which he finished with equal success His Autumn was next given to the public and is the most unfinished of the four it is not however without its beauties of which many have considered the story of Lavinia naturally and artfully introduced as the most affecting The story is in itself moving and tender It is perhaps no diminution to the merit of this beautiful tale that the hint of it is taken from the book of Ruth in the Old Testament  The author next published the Spring the induction to which is very poetical and beautiful  Come gentle Spring etherial mildness come  And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud  While music wakes around veil'd in a show'r  Of shadowing roses on our plains descend  It is addressed to the countess of Hertford with the following elegant compliment  O Hertford fitted or to shine in courts  With unaffected grace or walk the plains  With innocence and meditation joined  In soft assemblage listen to the song  Which thy own season paints while nature all  Is blooming and benevolent like thee  The descriptions in this poem are mild like the season they paint but towards the end of it the poet takes occasion to warn his countrymen against indulging the wild and irregular passion of love This digression is one of the most affecting in the whole piece and while he paints the language of a lover's breast agitated with the pangs of strong desire and jealous transports he at the same time dissuades the ladies from being too credulous in the affairs of gallantry He represents the natural influence of spring in giving a new glow to the beauties of the fair creation and firing their hearts with the passion of love  The shining moisture swells into her eyes  In brighter flow her wishing bosom heaves  With palpitations wild kind tumults seize  Her veins and all her yielding soul is love  From the keen gaze her lover turns away  Full of the dear extatic power and s  ck  With sighing languishment Ah then ye fair  Be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts  Dare not th' infectious sigh the pleading look  Downcast and low in meek submission drest  But full of guile Let not the servent tongue  Prompt to deceive with adulation smooth  Gain on your purpos'd will Nor in the bower  Where woodbines flaunt and roses shed a couch  While evening draws her crimson curtains round  Trust your soft minutes with betraying man  Summer has many manly and striking beauties of which the Hymn to the Sun is one of the sublimest and most masterly efforts of genius we have ever seenThere are some hints taken from Cowley's beautiful Hymn to LightMr Thomson has subjoined a Hymn to the Seasons which is not inferior to the foregoing in poetical merit  The Four Seasons considered separately each Season as a distinct poem has been judged defective in point of plan There appears no particular design the parts are not subservient to one another nor is there any dependance or connection throughout but this perhaps is a fault almost inseparable from a subject in itself so diversified as not to admit of such limitation He has not indeed been guilty of any incongruity the scenes described in spring are all peculiar to that season and the digressions which make up a fourth part of the poem flow naturally He has observed the same regard to the appearances of nature in the other seasons but then what he has described in the beginning of any of the seasons might as well be placed in the middle and that in the middle as naturally towards the close So that each season may rather be called an assemblage of poetical ideas than a poem as it seems written without a plan  Mr Thomson's poetical diction in the Seasons is very peculiar to him His manner of writing is entirely his own He has introduced a number of compound words converted substantives into verbs and in short has created a kind of new language for himself His stile has been blamed for its singularity and stiffness but with submission to superior judges we cannot but be of opinion that though this observation is true yet is it admirably fitted for description The object he paints stands full before the eye we admire it in all its lustre and who would not rather enjoy a perfect inspection into a  natural curiosity through a microscope capable of discovering all the minute beauties though its exterior form should not be comely than perceive an object but faintly through a microscope ill adapted for the purpose however its outside may be decorated Thomson has a stiffness in his manner but then his manner is new and there never yet arose a distinguished genius who had not an air peculiarly his own 'Tis true indeed the tow'ring sublimity of Mr Thomson's stile is ill adapted for the tender passions which will appear more fully when we consider him as a dramatic writer a sphere in which he is not so excellent as in other species of poetry  The merit of these poems introduced our author to the acquaintance and esteem of several persons distinguished by their rank or eminent for their talentsAmong the latter Dr Rundle afterwards bishop of Derry was so pleased with the spirit of benevolence and piety which breathes throughout the Seasons that he recommended him to the friendship of the late lord chancellor Talbot who committed to him the care of his eldest son then preparing to set out on his travels into France and Italy  With this young nobleman Mr Thomson performed what is commonly called The Tour of Europe and stay'd abroad about three years where no doubt he inriched his mind with the noble monuments of antiquity and the conversation of ingenious foreigners 'Twas by comparing modern Italy with the idea he had of the antient Romans which furnished him with the hint of writing his Liberty in three parts The first is Antient and Modern Italy compared The second Greece and the third Britain The whole is addressed to the eldest son of lord Talbot who died in the year upon his travels  Amongst Mr Thomson's poems is one to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton of which we shall  say no more than this that if he had never wrote any thing besides he deserved to enjoy a distinguished reputation amongst the poets Speaking of the amazing genius of Newton he says  Th' aerial flow of sound was known to him  From whence it first in wavy circles breaks  Nor could the darting beam of speed immense  Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye  Ev'n light itself which every thing displays  Shone undiscover'd till his brighter mind  Untwisted all the shining robe of day  And from the whitening undistinguished blaze  Collecting every separated ray  To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train  Of parent colours First the flaming red  Sprung vivid forth the tawny orange next  And next refulgent yellow by whose side  Fell the kind beams of allrefreshing green  Then the pure blue that swells autumnal skies  Aetherial play'd and then of sadder hue  Emerg'd the deepen'd indico as when  The heavy skirted evening droops with frost  While the last gleamings of refracted light  Died in the fainting violet away  These when the clouds distil the rosy shower  Shine out distinct along the watr'y bow  While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends  Delightful melting in the fields beneath  Myriads of mingling dyes from these result  And myriads still remainInfinite source  Of beauty everflushing ever new  About the year Mr Thomson wrote a piece called Britannia the purport of which was to rouse the nation to arms and excite in the spirit of the people a generous disposition to revenge the injuries done them by the Spaniards This is far from being one of his best poems  Upon the death of his generous patron lord chancellor Talbot for whom the nation joined with Mr Thomson in the most sincere inward sorrow he wrote an elegiac poem which does honour to the author and to the memory of that great man he meant to celebrate He enjoyed during lord Talbot's life a very profitable place which that worthy patriot had conferred upon him in recompence of the care he had taken in forming the mind of his son Upon his death his lordship's successor reserved the place for Mr Thomson and always expected when he should wait upon him and by performing some formalities enter into the possession of it This however by an unaccountable indolence he neglected and at last the place which he might have enjoyed with so little trouble was bestowed upon another  Amongst the latest of Mr Thomson's productions is his Castle of Indolence a poem of so extraordinary merit that perhaps we are not extravagant when we declare that this single performance discovers more genius and poetical judgment than all his other works put together We cannot here complain of want of plan for it is artfully laid naturally conducted and the descriptions rise in a beautiful succession It is written in imitation of Spenser's stile and the obsolete words with the simplicity of diction in some of the lines which borders on the ludicrous have been thought necessary to make the imitation more perfect  'The stile says Mr Thomson of that admirable poet as well as the measure in which he wrote are as it were appropriated by custom to all allegorical poems written in our language just as in French the stile of Marot who lived under Francis the Ist has been used in Tales and familiar Epistles by the politest writers of the age of Louis the XIVth'  We shall not at present enquire how far Mr Thomson is justifiable in using the obsolete words of Spenser As Sir Roger de Coverley observed on another occasion much may be said on both sides One thing is certain Mr Thomson's imitation is excellent and he must have no poetry in his imagination who can read the picturesque descriptions in his Castle of Indolence without emotion In his LXXIst Stanza he has the following picture of beauty  Here languid beauty kept her palefac'd court  Bevies of dainty dames of high degree  From every quarter hither made resort  Where from gross mortal care and bus'ness free  They lay pour'd out in ease and luxury  Or should they a vain shew of work assume  Alas and welladay what can it be  To knot to twist to range the vernal bloom  But far is cast the distaff spinningwheel and loom  He pursues the description in the subsequent Stanza  Their only labour was to kill the time  And labour dire it is and weary woe  They sit they loll turn o'er some idle rhime  Then rising sudden to the glass they go  Or saunter forth with tott'ring steps and slow  This soon too rude an exercise they find  Strait on the couch their limbs again they throw  Where hours on hours they sighing lie reclin'd  And court the vapoury God soft breathing in the wind  In the two following Stanzas the dropsy and hypochondria are beautifully described  Of limbs enormous but withal unsound  Soft swoln and pale here lay the Hydropsy  Unwieldly man with belly monstrous round  For ever fed with watery supply  For still he drank and yet he still was dry  And moping here did Hypochondria sit  Mother of spleen in robes of various die  Who vexed was full oft with ugly fit  And some her frantic deem'd and some her deem'd a wit  A lady proud she was of antient blood  Yet oft her fear her pride made crouchen low  She felt or fancy'd in her fluttering mood  All the diseases which the spitals know  And sought all physic which the shops bestow  And still new leaches and new drugs would try  Her humour ever wavering too and fro  For sometimes she would laugh and sometimes cry  And sudden waxed wroth and all she knew not why  The speech of Sir Industry in the second Canto when he enumerates the various blessings which flow from action is surely one of the highest instances of genius which can be produced in poetry In the second stanza before he enters upon the subject the poet complains of the decay of patronage and the general depravity of taste and in the third breaks out into the following exclamation which is so perfectly beautiful that it would be the greatest mortification not to transcribe it  I care not fortune what you me deny  You cannot rob me of free nature's grace  You cannot shut the windows of the sky  Through which Aurora shews her bright'ning face  You cannot bar my constant feet to trace  The woods and lawns by living stream at eve  Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace  And I their toys to the great children leave  Of fancy reason virtue nought can me bereave  Before we quit this poem permit us reader to give you two more stanzas from it the first shews Mr Thomson's opinion of Mr Quin as an actor of their friendship we may say more hereafter  STANZA LXVII Of the CASTLE of INDOLENCE  Here whilom ligg'd th' Aesopus  Mr Quin  of the age  But called by fame in soul ypricked deep  A noble pride restor'd him to the stage  And rous'd him like a giant from his sleep  Even from his slumbers we advantage reap  With double force th' enliven'd scene he wakes  Yet quits not nature's bounds He knows to keep  Each due decorum now the heart he shakes  And now with wellurg'd sense th' enlighten'd judgment takes  The next stanza wrote by a friend of the author's as the note mentions is a friendly though familiar compliment it gives us an image of our bard himself at once entertaining striking and just  STANZA LXVIII  A bard here dwelt more fat than bard beseems  Who void of envy guile and lust of gain  On virtue still and nature's pleasing themes  Pour'd forth his unpremeditated strain  The world forsaking with a calm disdain  Here laugh'd he careless in his easy seat  Here quas  'd encircl'd with the joyous train  Oft moralizing sage his ditty sweet  He loathed much to write ne cared to repeat  We shall now consider Mr Thomson as a dramatic writer  In the year about six years after he had been in London he brought a Tragedy upon the stage called Sophonisba built upon the Carthaginian history of that princess and upon which the famous Nathaniel Lee has likewise written a Tragedy This play met with a favourable reception from the public Mrs Oldfield greatly distinguished herself in the character of Sophonisba which Mr Thomson acknowledges in his preface  'I cannot conclude says he without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation They have indeed done me more than justice Whatever was designed as amiable and engageing in Masinessa shines out in Mr Wilks's action Mrs Oldfield in the character of Sophonisba has excelled what even in the fondness of an author I could either wish or imagine The grace dignity and happy variety of her action have been universally applauded and are truly admirable'  Before we quit this play we must not omit two anecdotes which happened the first night of the representation Mr Thomson makes one of his characters address Sophonisba in a line which some critics reckoned the false pathetic  O Sophonisba Sophonisba Oh  Upon which a smart from the pit cried out  Oh Jamey Thomson Jamey Thomson Oh  However illnatured this critic might be in interrupting the action of the play for sake of a joke yet it is certain that the line ridiculed does partake of the false pathetic and should be a warning to tragic poets to guard against the swelling stile for by aiming at the sublime they are often betrayed into the bombastMr Thomson who could not but feel all the emotions and sollicitudes of a young author the first night of his play wanted to place himself in some obscure part of the house in order to see the representation to the best advantage without being known as the poetHe accordingly placed himself in the upper gallery but such was the power of nature in him that he could not help repeating the parts along with the players and would sometimes whisper to himself  'now such a scene is to open'  by which he was soon discovered to be the author by some gentlemen who could not on account of the great crowd  in any other part of the house  After an interval of four years Mr Thomson exhibited to the public his second Tragedy called Agamemnon Mr Pope gave an instance of his great affection to Mr Thomson on this occasion he wrote two letters in its favour to the managers and honou  ed the representation on the first night with his presence As he had not been for some time at a play this was considered as a very great instance of esteem Mr Thomson submitted to have this play considerably shortened in the action as some parts were too long others unnecessary in which not the character but the poet spoke and though not brought on the stage till the month of April it continued to be acted with applause for several nights  Many have remark'd that his characters in his plays are more frequently descriptive than expressive of the passions but they all abound with uncommon beauties with fire and depth of thought with noble sentiments and nervous writing His speeches are often too long especially for an English audience perhaps sometimes they are unnaturally lengthened and 'tis certainly a greater relief to the ear to have the dialogue more broken yet our attention is well rewarded and in no passages perhaps in his tragedies more so than in the affecting account Melisander  The mention of this name reminds me of an obligation I had to Mr Thomson and at once a  opportunity offers of gratefully acknowledging the favour and doing myself justice  I had the pleasure of perusing the play of Agamemnon before it was introduced to the manager Mr Thomson was so thoroughly satisfied I might say more with my reading of it he said he was confirmed in his design of giving to me the part of Melisander When I expressed my sentiments of the favour he told me he thought it none that my old acquaintance Savage knew he had not forgot my taste in reading the poem of Winter some years before he added that when before this meeting he had expressed his doubt to which of the actors he should give this part as he had seen but few plays since his return from abroad Savage warmly urged I was the fittest person and with an oath affirmed that Theo Cibber would taste it feel it and act it perhaps he might extravagantly add  'beyond any one else'  'Tis likely Mr Savage might be then more vehement in this assertion as some of his friends had been more used to see me in a comic than a serious light and which was indeed more frequent  y my choice But to go on When I read the play to the manager Mr Quin c at which several gentlemen intimate friends of the author were present I was complimented by them all Mr Quin particularly declared he never heard a play done so much justice to in reading through all its various parts Mrs Porter also who on this occasion was to appear in the character of Clytemnestra so much approved my entering into the taste sense and spirit of the piece that she was pleased to desire me to repeat a reading of it which at her request and that of other principal performers I often did they all confessed their approbation with thanks  When this play was to come forward into rehearsal Mr Thomson told me another actor had been recommended to him for this part in private by the manager who by the way our author or any one else never esteemed as the best judge of either play or player But money may purchase and interest procure a patent though they cannot purchase taste or parts the person proposed was possibly some favoured flatterer the partner of his private pleasures or humble admirer of his table ta  k These little monarchs have their little courtiers Mr Thomson insisted on my keeping the part He said 'Twas his opinion none but myself or Mr Quin could do it any justice and as that excellent actor could not be spared from the part of Agamemnon in the persormance of which character he added to his reputation though before justly rated as the first actor of that time be was peremptory for my appearing in it I did so and acquitted myself to the satisfaction of the author and his friends men eminent in rank in taste and knowledge and received testimonies of approbation from the audience by their attention and applause  By this time the reader may be ready to cry out  'to what purpose is all this'  Have patience sir As I gained reputation in the forementioned character is there any crime in acknowledging my obligation to Mr Thomson or am I unpardonable though I should pride myself on his good opinion and friendship may not gratitude as well as vanity be concerned in this relation but there is another reason that may stand as an excuse for my being led into this long narrative which as it is only an annotation not made part of our author's life the reader at his option may peruse or pass it over without being interrupted in his attention to what more immediately concerns Mr Thomson  As what I have related is a truth which living men of worth can testify and as it evidently shews that Mr Savage's o  inion of me as an actor was in this latter part of his life far from contemptible of which perhaps in his earlier days he had too lavishly spoke I thought this no improper nor illtimed contradiction to a remark the writer of  Published about the year    Mr Savage's Life has been pleased in his Gaité de Coeur to make which almost amounts to an unhandsome innuendo that Mr Savage and some of his friends thought me no actor at all  I accidentally met with the book some years ago and dipt into that part where the author says  'The preface to Sir Thomas Overbu  y contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming excellences of Mr Theophilus Cibber which Mr Savage could not in the latter part of his life see his friends about to read without snatching the play out of their hands'  As poor Savage was well remembered to have been as inconsiderate inconsistent and inconstant a mortal as ever existed what he might have said carried but little weight and as he would blow both hot and cold nay too frequently to gratify the company present would sacrifice the absent though his best friend I disregarded this invidious hint 'till I was lately informed a person of distinction in the learned world had condescended to become the biographer of this unhappy man's unimportant life as the sanction of such a name might prove of prejudice to me I have since thought it worth my notice  The truth is I met Savage one summer in a condition too melancholy for description He was starving I supported him and my father cloathed him 'till his tragedy was brought on the stage where it met with success in the representation tho' acted by the young part of the company in the summer season whatever might be the merit of hisplay his necessities were too pressing to wait 'till winter for its performance When it was just going to be published as I met with uncommon encouragement in my young attempt in the part of Somerset he repeated to me a most extraordinary compliment as he might then think it which he said he intended to make me in his preface Neither my youth for I was then but or vanity was so devoid of judgment as to prevent my objecting to it I told him I imagined this extravagancy would have so contrary an effect to his intention that what he kindly meant for praise might be misinterpreted or render him liable to censure and me to ridicule I insisted on his omitting it contrary to his usual obstinacy he consented and sent his orders to the Printer to leave it out it was too late the sheets were all work'd off and the play was advertised to come out as it did the next day  gives of his being betrayed and left on the desolate island  'Tis thus my friend  Whilst sunk in unsuspecting sleep I lay  Some midnight ruffians rush'd into my chamber  Sent by Egisthus who my presence deem'd  Obstructive so I solve it to his views  Black views I fear as you perhaps may know  Sudden they seiz'd and muffled up in darkness  Strait bore me to the sea whose instant prey  I did conclude myself when first around  The ship unmoor'd I heard the chiding wave  But these fel tools of c  el power it seems  Had orders in a desart isle to leave me  There hopeless helpless comfortless to prove  The utmost gall and bitterness of death  Thus malice often overshoots itself  And some unguarded accident betrays  The man of bloodNext nighta dreary night  Cast on the wildest of the Cyclad Isles  Where never human foot had mark'd the shore  These ruffians left meYet believe me Arcas  Such is the rooted love we bear mankind  All ruffians as they were I never heard  A sound so dismal as their parting oars  Then horrid silence follow'd broke alone  By the low murmurs of the restless deep  Mixt with the doubtful breeze that now and then  Sigh'd thro' the mournful woods Beneath a shade  I sat me down more heavily oppress'd  More desolate at heart than e'er I felt  Before When Philomela o'er my head  Began to tune her melancholy strain  As piteous of my woes 'till by degrees  Composing sleep on wounded nature shed  A kind but short relief At early morn  Wak'd by the chant of birds I look'd around  For usual objects objects found I none  Except before me stretch'd the toiling main  And rocks and woods in savage view behind  Wrapt for a moment in amaz'd confusion  My thought turn'd giddy round when all at once  To memory full my dire condition rush'd  In the year Mr Thomson offered to the stage a Tragedy called Edward and Eleonora which was forbid to be acted for some political reason which it is not in our power to guess  The play of Tancred and Sigismunda was acted in the year this succeeded beyond any other  of Thomson's plays and is now in possession of the stage The plot is borrowed from a story in the celebrated romance of Gil Blas The fable is very interesting the characters are few but active and the attention in this play is never suffered to wander The character of Seffredi has been justly censured as inconsistent forced and unnatural  By the command of his royal highness the prince of Wales Mr Thomson in conjunction with Mr Mallet wrote the Masque of Alfred which was performed twice in his royal highness's gardens at Cliffden Since Mr Thomson's death this piece has been almost entirely new modelled by Mr Mallet and brought on the stage in the year its success being fresh in the memory of its frequent auditors 'tis needless to say more concerning it  Mr Thomson's last Tragedy called Coriolanus was not acted till after his death the profits of it were given to his sisters in Scotland one of whom is married to a minister there and the other to a man of low circumstances in the city of Edinburgh This play which is certainly the least excellent of any of Thomson's was first offered to Mr Garrick but he did not think proper to accept it The prologue was written by Sir George Lyttleton and spoken by Mr Quin which had a very happy effect upon the audience Mr Qu  n was the particular friend of Thomson and when he spoke the following lines which are in themselves very tender all the endearments of a long acquaintance rose at once to his imagination while the tears gushed from his eyes  He lov'd his friends forgive this gushing tear  Alas I feel I am no actor here  He lov'd his friends with such a warmth of heart  So clear of int'rest so devoid of art  Such generous freedom such unshaken zeal  No words can speak it but our tears may tell  The beautiful break in these lines had a fine effect in speaking Mr Quin here excelled himself he never appeared a greater actor than at this instant when he declared himself none 'twas an exquisite stroke to nature art alone could hardly reach it Pardon the digression reader but we feel a desire to say somewhat more on this head The poet and the actor were friends it cannot then be quite foreign to the purpose to proceed A deepfetch'd sigh filled up the heart felt pause grief spread o'er all the countenance the tear started to the eye the muscles fell and  ' The whiteness of his cheek  ' Was apter than his tongue to speak his tale'  They all expressed the tender feelings of a manly heart becoming a Thomson's friend His pause his recovery were masterly and he delivered the whole with an emphasis and pathos worthy the excellent lines he spoke worthy the great poet and good man whose merits they painted and whose loss they deplored  The epilogue too which was spoken by Mrs Woffington with an exquisite humour greatly pleased These circumstances added to the consideration of the author's being no more procured this play a run of nine nights which without these assistances 'tis likely it could not have had for without playing the critic it is not a piece of equal merit to many other of his works It was his misfortune as a dramatist that he never knew when to have done he makes every character speak while there is any thing to be said and during these long  interviews the action too stands still and the story languishes His Tancred and Sigismunda may be excepted from this general censure But his characters are too little distinguished they seldom vary from one another in their manner of speaking In short Thomson was born a descriptive poet he only wrote for the stage from a motive too obvious to be mentioned and too strong to be resisted He is indeed the eldest born of Spenser and he has often confessed that if he had any thing excellent in poetry he owed it to the inspiration he first received from reading the Fairy Queen in the very early part of his life  In August the world was deprived of this great ornament of poetry and genius by a violent fever which carried him off in the th year of his age Before his death he was provided for by Sir George Littleton in the profitable place of comptroller of America which he lived not long to enjoy Mr Thomson was extremely beloved by his acquaintance He was of an open generous disposition and was sometimes tempted to an excessive indulgence of the social pleasures A failing too frequently inseparable from men of genius His exterior appearance was not very engaging but he grew more and more agreeable as he entered into conversation He had a grateful heart ready to acknowledge every favour he received and he never forgot his old benefactors notwithstanding a longabsence new acquaintance and additional eminence of which the following instance cannot be unacceptable to the reader  Some time before Mr Thomson's fatal illness a gentleman enquired for him at his house in KewLane near Richmond where he then lived This gentleman had been his acquaintance when very young and proved to be Dr Gustard the son of a revd minister in the city of Edinburgh Mr Gustard had been Mr Thomson's patron in the early  part of his life and contributed from his own purse Mr Thomson's father not being in very affluent circumstances to enable him to prosecute his studies The visitor sent not in his name but only intimated to the servant that an old acquaintance desired to see Mr Thomson Mr Thomson came forward to receive him and looking stedfastly at him for they had not seen one another for many years said Troth Sir I cannot say I ken your countenance wellLet me therefore crave your name Which the gentleman no sooner mentioned but the tears gushed from Mr Thomson's eyes He could only reply good God are you the son of my dear friend my old benefactor and then rushing to his arms he tenderly embraced him rejoicing at so unexpected a meeting  It is a true observation that whenever gratitude is absent from a heart it is generally capable of the most consummate baseness and on the other hand where that generous virtue has a powerful prevalence in the soul the heart of such a man is fraught with all those other endearing and tender qualities which constitute goodness Such was the heart of this amiable poet whose life was as inoffensive as his page was moral For of all our poets he is the farthest removed from whatever has the appearance of indecency and as Sir George Lyttleton happily expresses it in the prologue to Mr Thomson's Coriolanus  His chaste muse employ'd her heav'ntaught lyre  None but the noblest passions to inspire  Not one immoral one corrupted thought  One line which dying he could wish to blot  ALEXANDER POPE  Esq  THIS illustrious poet was born at London in and was descended from a good family of that name in Oxfordshire the head of which was the earl of Downe whose sole heiress married the earl of Lindsey His father a man of primitive simplicity and integrity of manners was a merchant of London who upon the Revolution quitted trade and converted his effects into money amounting to near l with which he retired into the country and died in at the age of  Our poet's mother who lived to a very advanced age being years old when she died in was the daughter of William Turner  Esq  of York She had three brothers one of whom was killed another died in the service of king Charles and the eldest following his fortunes and becoming a general officer in Spain left her what estate remained after sequestration and forfeitures of her family To these circumstances our poet alludes in his epistle to Dr Arbuthnot in which he mentions his parents  Of gentle blood part shed in honour's cause  While yet in Britain honour had applause  Each parent sprangWhat fortune praytheir own  And better got than Bestia's from the throne  Born to no pride inheriting no strife  Nor marrying discord in a noble wife  Stranger to civil and religious rage  The good man walked innoxious thro' his age  No courts he saw no suits would ever try  Nor dar'd an oath nor hazarded a lye  Unlearn'd he knew no schoolmen's sub  le art  No language but the language of the heart  By nature honest by experience wise  Healthy by temp'rance and by exercise  His life though long to sickness past unknown  His death was instant and without a groan  The education of our great author was attended with circumstances very singular and some of them extremely unfavourable but the amazing force of his genius fully compensated the want of any advantage in his earliest instruction He owed the knowledge of his letters to an aunt and having learned very early to read took great delight in it and taught himself to write by copying after printed books the characters of which he could imitate to great perfection He began to compose verses farther back than he could well remember and at eight years of age when he was put under one Taverner a priest who taught him the rudiments of the Latin and Greek tongues at the same time he met with Ogilby's Homer which gave him great delight and this was encreased by Sandys's Ovid The raptures which these authors even in the disguise of such translations then yielded him were so strong that he spoke of them with pleasure ever after From Mr Taverner's tuition he was sent to a private school at Twiford near Winchester where he continued about a year and was then removed to another near Hyde Park Corner but was so unfortunate as to lose under his two last masters what he had acquired under the first  While he remained at this school being permitted to go to the playhouse with some of his school fellows of a more advanced age he was so charmed with dramatic representations that he formed the translation of the Iliad into a play from several of the speeches in Ogilby's translation connected with verses of his own and the several parts were performed by the upper boys of the school except that of Ajax by the master's gardener At the age of our young poet went with his father to reside at his house at Binfield in Windsor forest where he was for a few months under the tuition of another priest with as little success as before so that he resolved now to become his own master by reading those Classic Writers which gave him most entertainment and by this method at fifteen he gained a ready habit in the learned languages to which he soon after added the French and Italian Upon his retreat to the forest he became first acquainted with the writings of Waller Spenser and Dryden in the last of which he immediately found what he wanted and the poems of that excellent writer were never out of his hands they became his model and from them alone he learned the whole magic of his versification  The first of our author's compositions now extant in print is an Ode on Solitude written before he was twelve years old Which consider'd as the production of so early an age is a perfect master piece nor need he have been ashamed of it had it been written in the meridian of his genius While it breathes the most delicate spirit of poetry it at the same time demonstrates his love of solitude and the rational pleasures which attend the retreats of a contented country life  Two years after this he translated the first Book of Statius' Thebais and wrote a copy of verses on Silence in imitation of the Earl of Rochester's  poem on Nothing  See a Note in Warburton's Edition of Pope's Works  Thus we find him no sooner capable of holding the pen than he employed it in writing verses  "  He lips'd in Numbers for the Numbers came  "  Though we have had frequent opportunity to observe that poets have given early displays of genius yet we cannot recollect that among the inspired tribe one can be found who at the age of twelve could produce so animated an Ode or at the age of fourteen translate from the Latin It has been reported indeed concerning Mr Dryden that when he was at WestminsterSchool the master who had assigned a poetical task to some of the boys of writing a Paraphrase on our Saviour's Miracle of turning Water into Wine was perfectly astonished when young Dryden presented him with the following line which he asserted was the best comment could be written upon it  The conscious water saw its God and blush'd  This was the only instance of an early appearance of genius in this great man for he was turn'd of before he acquired any reputation an age in which Mr Pope's was in its full distinction  The year following that in which Mr Pope wrote his poem on Silence he began an Epic Poem intitled Alcander which he afterwards very judiciously committed to the flames as he did likewise a Comedy and a Tragedy the latter taken from a story in the legend of St Genevieve both of these being the product of those early days But his Pastorals which were written in when he was only years of age were esteemed by Sir  William Trumbull Mr Granville Mr Wycherley Mr Walsh and others of his friends too valuable to be condemned to the same sate  Mr Pope's Pastorals are four viz  Spring address'd to Sir William Trumbull  Summer to Dr Garth  Autumn to Mr Wycherley  Winter in memory of Mrs Tempest  The three great writers of Pastoral Dialogue which Mr Pope in some measure seems to imitate are Theocritus Virgil and Spenser Mr Pope is of opinion that Theocritus excells all others in nature and simplicity  That Virgil who copies Theocritus refines on his original and in all points in which judgment has the principal part is much superior to his master  That among the moderns their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these antients their pattern The most considerable genius appears in the famous Tasso and our Spenser Tasso in his Aminta has far excelled all the pastoral writers as in his Gierusalemme he has outdone the Epic Poets of his own country But as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem the Pastoral Comedy in Italy it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the antients Spenser's Calendar in Mr Dryden's opinion is the most compleat work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of Virgil But this he said before Mr Pope's Pastorals appeared  Mr Walsh pronounces on our Shepherd's Boy as Mr Pope called himself the following judgment in a letter to Mr Wycherly  'The verses are very tender and easy The author seems to have a particular genius for that kind of poetry and a judgment that much  exceeds the years you told me he was of It is no flattery at all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his age I shall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him and if he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my house I shall be very glad to read the verses with him and give him him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this letter'  Thus early was Mr Pope introduced to the acquaintance of men of genius and so improved every advantage that he made a more rapid progress towards a consummation in fame than any of our former English poets His Messiah his WindsorForest the first part of which was written at the same time with his pastorals his Essay on Criticism in and his Rape of the Lock in established his poetical character in such a manner that he was called upon by the public voice to enrich our language with the translation of the Iliad which he began at and executed in five years This was published for his own benefit by subscription the only kind of reward which he received for his writings which do honour to our age and country His religion rendering him incapable of a place which the lord treasurer Oxford used to express his concern for but without offering him a pension as the earl of Halifax and Mr Secretary Craggs afterwards did though Mr Pope declined it  The reputation of Mr Pope gaining every day upon the world he was caressed flattered and railed at according as he was feared or loved by different persons Mr Wycherley was amongst the first authors of established reputation who contributed to advance his fame and with whom he for some time lived in the most unreserved intimacy This poet in his old age conceived a design of publishing his poems and as he was but a very  mperfect master of numbers he entrusted his manuscripts to Mr Pope and submitted them to his correction The freedom which our young bard was under a necessity to use in order to polish and refine what was in the original rough unharmonious and indelicate proved disgustful to the old gentleman then near who perhaps was a little ashamed that a boy at should so severely correct his works Letters of dissatisfaction were written by Mr Wycherley and at last he informed him in few words that he was going out of town without mentioning to what place and did not expect to hear from him 'till he came back This cold indifference extorted from Mr Pope a protestation that nothing should induce him ever to write to him again Notwithstanding this peevish behaviour of Mr Wycherley occasioned by jealousy and infirmities Mr Pope preserved a constant respect and reverence for him while he lived and after his death lamented him In a letter to Edward Blount  Esq  written immediately upon the death of this poet he has there related some anecdotes of Wycherly which we shall insert here especially as they are not taken notice of in his life  'DEAR SIR  'I know of nothing that will be so interesting to you at present as some circumstances of the last act of that eminent comic poet and our friend Wycherley He had often told me as I doubt not he did all his acquaintance that he would marry as soon as his life was despaired of accordingly a few days before his death he underwent the ceremony and joined together those two sacraments which wise men say should be the last we receive for if you observe matrimony is placed after extreme unction in our catechism as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they are to  be taken The old man then lay down satisfied in the conscience of having by this one act paid hi  just debts obliged a woman who he was told had merit and shewn a heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next heir Some hundred pounds which he had with the lady discharged those debts a jointure of four hundred a year made her a recompence and the nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could with the miserable remains of a mortgaged estate I saw our friend twice after this was done less peevish in hi  sickness than he used to be in his health neither much afraid of dying nor which in him had been more likely much ashamed of marrying The evening before he expired he called his young wife to the bedside and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request the last he should ever make Upon her assurance of consenting to it he told her my dear it is only this that you will never marry an old man again I cannot help remarking that sickness which often destroys both wit and wisdom yet seldom has power to remove that talent we call humour Mr Wycherley shewed this even in this last compliment though I think his request a little hard for why should he bar her from doubling her jointure on the same easy terms'  One of the most affecting and tender compositions of Mr Pope is his Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady built on a true story We are informed in the Life of Pope for which Curl obtained a patent that this young lady was a particular favourite of the poet though it is not ascertained whether he himself was the person from whom she was removed This young lady was of very high birth possessed an opulent fortune and under the tutorage of an uncle who gave her an education suitable to her titles and pretensions She was esteemed a match for the greatest peer in the realm but in her early years she suffered her  heart to be engaged by a young gentleman and in consequence of this attachment rejected offers made to her by persons of quality seconded by the sollicitations of her uncle Her guardian being surprized at this behaviour set spies upon her to find out the real cause of her indifference Her correspondence with her lover was soon discovered and when urged upon that topic she had too much truth and honour to deny it The uncle finding that she would make no efforts to disengage her affection after a little time forced her abroad where she was received with a ceremony due to her quality but restricted from the conversation of every one but the spies of this severe guardian so that it was impossible for her lover even to have a letter delivered to her hands She languished in this place a considerable time bore an infinite deal of sickness and was overwhelmed with the profoundest sorrow Nature being wearied out with continual distress and being driven a  last to despair the unfortunate lady as Mr Pope justly calls her put an end to her own life having bribed a maidservant to procure her a sword She was found upon the ground weltering in her blood The severity of the laws of the place where this fair unfortunate perished denied her Christian burial and she was interred without solemnity or even any attendants to perform the last offices of the dead except some young people of the neighbourhood who saw her put into common ground and strewed the grave with flowers  The poet in the elegy takes occasion to mingle with the tears of sorrow just reproaches upon her cruel uncle who drove her to this violation  But thou false guardian of a charge too good  Thou base betrayer of a brother's blood  See on those ruby lips the trembling breath  Those cheeks now fading at the blast of death  Lifeless the breast which warm'd the world before  And those lovedarting eyes must roll no more  The conclusion of this elegy is irresistably affecting  So peaceful rests without a stone a name  Which once had beauty titles wealth and fame  How lov'd how honoured once avails thee not  To whom related or by whom begot  A heap of dust alone remains of thee  'Tis all thou art and all the proud shall be  No poem of our author's more deservedly obtained him reputation than his Essay on Criticism Mr Addison in his Spectator No has celebrated it with such profuse terms of admiration that it is really astonishing to find the same man endeavouring afterwards to diminish that fame he had contributed to raise so high  "The art of criticism says he which was published some months ago is a masterpiece in its kind The observations follow one another like those in Horace's Art of Poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer They are some of them uncommon but such as the reader must assent to when he sees them explained with that elegance and perspicuity in which they are delivered As for those which are the most known and the most received they are placed in so beautiful a light and illustrated with such apt allusions that they have in them all the graces of novelty and make the reader who was before acquainted with them still more convinced of their truth and solidity And here give me leave to mention what Monsieur Boileau has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his works that wit and fine writing do not consist so much in advancing things  that are new as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn It is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world to make observations in criticism morality or any art and science which have not been touched upon by others We have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong more beautiful or more uncommon lights If a reader examines Horace's Art of Poetry he will find but few precepts in it which he may not meet with in Aristotle and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the Augustan age His way of expressing and applying them not his invention of them is what we are chiefly to admire  "Longinus in his Reflexions has given us the same kind of sublime which he observes in the several passages which occasioned them I cannot but take notice that our English author has after the same manner exemplified several of his precepts in the very precepts themselves"  He then produces some instances of a particular kind of beauty in the numbers and concludes with saying that we have three poems in our tongue of the same nature and each a masterpiece in its kind The Essay on Translated Verse the Essay on the Art of Poetry and the Essay on Criticism"  In the Lives of Addison and Tickell we have thrown out some general hints concerning the quarrel which subsisted between our poet and the former of these gentlemen here it will not be improper to give a more particular account of it  The author of Mist's Journal positively asserts  'that Mr Addison raised Pope from obscurity obtained him the acquaintance and friendship of the whole body of our nobility and transferred his powerful influence with those great men to this rising bard who frequently levied by that means unusual contributions on the public No  sooner was his body lifeless but this author reviving his resentment libelled the memory of his departed friend and what was still more heinous made the scandal public'  When this charge of ingratitude and dishonour was published against Mr Pope to acquit himself of it he called upon any nobleman whose friendship or any one gentleman whose subscription Mr Addison had procured to our author to stand forth and declare it that truth might appear But the whole libel was proved a malicious story by many persons of distinction who several years before Mr Addison's decease approved those verses denominated a libel but which were 'tis said a friendly rebuke sent privately in our author's own hand to Mr Addison himself and never made public 'till by Curl in his Miscellanies mo The lines indeed are elegantly satirical and in the opinion of many unprejudiced judges who had opportunities of knowing the character of Mr Addison are no ill representation of him Speaking of the poetical triflers of the times who had declared against him he makes a sudden transition to Addison  Peace to all such But were there one whose fires  True genius kindles and fair fame inspires  Blest with each talent and each art to please  And born to write converse and live with ease  Should such a man too  ond to rule alone  Bear like the Turk no rival near the throne  View him with scornful yet with jealous eyes  And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise  Damn with faint praise assent with civil leer  And without sneering others teach to sneer  Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike  Just hint a fault and hesitate dislike  Alike reserv'd to blame or to commend  A tim'rous foe and a suspicious friend  Dreading even fools by flatt'rers besieg'd  And so obliging that he ne'er oblig'd  Like Cato give his little senate laws  And sit attentive to his own applause  While Wits and Templars ev'ry sentence raise  And wonder with a foolish face of praise  Who but must laugh if such a man there be  Who would not weep if Atticus were he  Some readers may think these lines severe but the treatment he received from Mr Addison was more than sufficient to justify them which will appear when we particularize an interview between these two poetical antagonists procured by the warm sollicitations of Sir Richard Steele who was present at it as well as Mr Gay  Mr Jervas being one day in company with Mr Addison the conversation turned upon Mr Pope for whom Addison at that time expressed the highest regard and assured Mr Jervas that he would make use not only of his interest but of his art likewise to do Mr Pope service he then said he did not mean his art of poetry but his art at court and protested notwithstanding many insinuations were spread that it shall not be his fault if there was not the best understanding and intelligence between them He observed that Dr Swift might have carried him too far among the enemy during the animosity but now all was safe and Mr Pope in his opinion was escaped When Mr Jervas communicated this conversation to Mr Pope he made this reply  'The friendly office you endeavour to do between Mr Addison and me deserves acknowledgments on my part You thoroughly know my regard to his character and my readiness to testify it by all ways in my power you also thoroughly knew the meanness of that proceeding of Mr Phillips to make a man I so highly value suspect my  disposition towards him But  after all Mr Addison must be judge in what regards himself and as he has seemed not to be a very just one to me so I must own to you I expect nothing but civility from him how much soever I wish for his friendship and as for any offers of real kindness or service which it is in his power to do me I should be ashamed to receive them from a man who has no better opinion of my morals than to think me a party man nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or envying another's reputation as a poet In a word Mr Addison is sure of my respect at all times and of my real friendship whenever he shall think fit to know me for what I am'  Some years after this conversation at the desire of Sir Richard Steele they met At first a very cold civility and nothing else appeared on either side for Mr Addison had a natural reserve and gloom at the beginning of an evening which by conversation and a glass brightened into an easy chearfulness Sir Richard Steele who was a most social benevolent man begged of him to fulfill his promise in dropping all animosity against Mr Pope Mr Pope then desired to be made sensible how he had offended and observed that the translation of Homer if that was the great crime was undertaken at the request and almost at the command of Sir Richard Steele He entreated Mr Addison to speak candidly and freely though it might be with ever so much severity rather than by keeping up forms of complaisance conceal any of his faults This Mr Pope spoke in such a manner as plainly indicated he thought Mr Addison the aggressor and expected him to condescend and own himself the cause of the breach between them But he was disappointed for Mr Addison without appearing to be angry was quite overcome with it He began with declaring that he always had wished  him well had often endeavoured to be his friend and in that light advised him if his nature was capable of it to divest himself of part of his vanity which was too great for his merit that he had not arrived yet to that pitch of excellence he might imagine or think his most partial readers imagined that when he and Sir Richard Steele corrected his verses they had a different air reminding Mr Pope of the amendment by Sir Richard of a line in the poem called The MESSIAH  He wipes the tears for ever from our eyes  Which is taken from the prophet Isaiah  The Lord God will wipe all tears from off all faces  From every face he wipes off ev'ry tear  And it stands so altered in the newer editions of Mr Pope's works He proceeded to lay before him all the mistakes and inaccuracies hinted at by the writers who had attacked Mr Pope and added many things which he himself objected to Speaking of his translation in general he said that he was not to be blamed for endeavouring to get so large a sum of money but that it was an illexecuted thing and not equal to Tickell which had all the spirit of Homer Mr Addison concluded in a low hollow voice of feigned temper that he was not sollicitous about his own fame as a poet that he had quitted the muses to enter into the business of the public and that all he spoke was though friendship to Mr Pope whom he advised to have a less exalted sense of his own merit  Mr Pope could not well bear such repeated reproaches but bol  ly told Mr Addison that he appealed from his judgment to the public and that  he had long known him too well to expect any friendship from him upbraided him with being a pensioner from his youth sacrificing the very learning purchased by the public money to a mean thirst of power that he was sent abroad to encourage literature in place of which he had always endeavoured to suppress merit At last the contest grew so warm that they parted without any ceremony and Mr Pope upon this wrote the foregoing verses which are esteemed too true a picture of Mr Addison  In this account and indeed in all other accounts which have been given concerning this quarrel it does not appear that Mr Pope was the aggressor If Mr Addison entertained suspicions of Mr Pope's being carried too far among the enemy the danger was certainly Mr Pope's and not Mr Addison's It was his misfortune and not his crime If Mr Addison should think himself capable of becoming a rival to Mr Pope and in consequence of this opinion publish a translation of part of Homer at the same time with Mr Pope's and if the public should decide in favour of the latter by reading his translation and neglecting the other can any fault be imputed to Mr Pope could he be blamed for exerting all his abilities in so arduous a province and was it his fault that Mr Addison for the first book of Homer was undoubtedly his could not translate to please the public Besides was it not somewhat presumptuous to insinuate to Mr Pope that his verses bore another face when he corrected them while at the same time the translation of Homer which he had never seen in manuscript bore away the palm from that very translation he himself asserted wa  done in the true spirit of Homer In matters of genius the public judgment seldom errs and in this case posterity has confirmed the sentence of that age which gave the preference to Mr Pope for his translation  is in the hands of all readers of taste while the other is seldom regarded but as a foil to Pope's  It would appear as if Mr Addison were himself so immersed in party business as to contract his benevolence to the limits of a faction Which was infinitely beneath the views of a philosopher and the rules which that excellent writer himself established If this was the failing of Mr Addison it was not the error of Pope for he kept the strictest correspondence with some persons whose affections to the Whiginterest were suspected yet was his name never called in question While he was in favour with the duke of Buckingham the lords Bolingbroke Oxford and Harcourt Dr Swift and Mr Prior he did not drop his correspondence with the lord Hallifax Mr Craggs and most of those who were at the head of the Whig interest A professed Jacobite one day remonstrated to Mr Pope that the people of his party took it ill that he should write with Mr Steele upon ever so indifferent a subject at which he could not help smiling and observed that he hated narrowness of soul in any party and that if he renounced his reason in religious matters he should hardly do it on any other and that he could pray not only for opposite parties but even for opposite religions Mr Pope considered himself as a citizen of the world and was therefore obliged to pray for the prosperity of mankind in general As a son of Britain he wished those councils might be suffered by providence to prevail which were most for the interest of his native country But as politics was not his study he could not always determine at least with any degree of certainty whose councils were best and had charity enough to believe that contending parties might mean well As taste and science are confined to no  country so ought they not to be excluded from any party and Mr Pope had an unexceptionable right to live upon terms of the strictest friendship with every man of parts to which party soever he might belong Mr Pope's uprightness in his conduct towards contending politicians is demonstrated by his living independent of either faction He accepted no place and had too high a spirit to become a pensioner  Many effects however were made to proselyte him from the Popish f  ith which all proved ineffectual His friends conceived hopes from the moderation which he on all occasions expressed that he was really a Pro  e  tant in his heart and that upon the death of his mother he would not scruple to declare his sentiments notwithstanding the reproaches he might incur from the Popish party and the public observation it would draw upon him The bishop of Rochester strongly advised him to read the controverted points between the Protestant and the Catholic church to suffer his unprejudiced reason to determine for him and he made no doubt but a separation from the Romish communion would soon ensue To this Mr Pope very candidly answered  'Whether the change would be to my spiritual advantage God only knows This I know that I mean as well in the religion I now profess as ever I can do in any other Can a man who thinks so justify a change even if he thought both equally good To such an one the part of joining with any one body of Christians might perhaps be easy but I think it would not be so to renounce the other  'Your lordship has formerly advised me to read the best controversies between the churches Shall I tell you a secret I did so at years old for I loved reading and my father had no other books there was a collection of all that  had been written on both sides in the reign of King James II I warmed my head with them and the consequence was I found myself a Papist or a Protestant by turns according to the last book I read I am afraid most seekers are in the same case and when they stop they are not so properly converted as outwitted You see how little glory you would gain by my conversion and after all I verily believe your lordship and I are both of the same religion if we were thoroughly understood by one another and that all honest and reasonable Christians would be so if they did but talk enough together every day and had nothing to do together but to serve God and live in peace with their neighbours  'As to the temporal side of the question I can have no dispute with you it is certain all the beneficial circumstances of life and all the shining ones lie on the part you would invite me to But if I could bring myself to fancy what I think you do but fancy that I have any talents for active life I want health for it and besides it is a real truth I have if possible less inclination than ability Contemplative life is not only my scene but is my habit too I begun my life where most people end theirs with all that the world calls ambition I don't know why it is called so for to me it always seemed to be stooping or climbing I'll tell you my politic and religious sentiments in a few words In my politics I think no farther than how to preserve my peace of life in any government under which I live nor in my religion than to preserve the peace of my conscience in any church with which I communicate I hope all churches and all governments are so far of God as they are rightly understood and rightly administered and where they are or may  be wrong I leave it to God alone to mend or reform them which whenever he does it must be by greater instruments than I am I am not a Papist for I renounce the temporal invasions of the papal power and detest their arrogated authority over Princes and States I am a Catholic in the strictest sense of the word If I was born under an absolute Prince I would be a quiet subject but I thank God I was not I have a due sense of the excellence of the British constitution In a word the things I have always wished to see are not a Roman Catholic or a French Catholic or a Spanish Catholic but a True Catholic and not a King of Whigs or or a King of Tories but a King of England'  These are the peaceful maxims upon which we find Mr Pope conducted his life and if they cannot in some respects be justified yet it must be owned that his religion and his politics were well enough adapted for a poet which entitled him to a kind of universal patronage and to make every good man his friend  Dean Swift sometimes wrote to Mr Pope on the topic of changing his religion and once humorously offered him twenty pounds for that purpose Mr Pope's answer to this lord Orrery has obliged the world by preserving in the life of Swift It is a perfect masterpiece of wit and pleasantry  We have already taken notice that Mr Pope was called upon by the public voice to translate the Iliad which he performed with so much applause and at the same time with so much profit to himself that he was envied by many writers whose vanity perhaps induced them to believe themselves equal to so great a design A combination of inferior wits were employed to write The Popiad in which his translation is characterized as unjust to the original without beauty of language or variety of numbers Instead of the justness of the original they say there is absurdity  and extravagance Instead of the beautiful language of the original there is solecism and barbarous English A candid reader may easily discern from this furious introduction that the critics were actuated rather by malice than truth and that they must judge with their eyes shut who can see no beauty of language no harmony of numbers in this translation  But the most formidable critic against Mr Pope in this great undertaking was the celebrated Madam Dacier whom Mr Pope treated with less ceremony in his Notes on the Iliad than in the opinion of some people was due to her sex This learned lady was not without a sense of the injury and took an opportunity of discovering her resentment  'Upon finishing says she the second edition of my translation of Homer a particular friend sent me a translation of part of Mr Pope's preface to his Version of the Iliad As I do not understand English I cannot form any judgment of his performance though I have heard much of it I am indeed willing to believe that the praises it has met with are not unmerited because whatever work is approved by the English nation cannot be bad but yet I hope I may be permitted to judge of that part of the preface which has been transmitted to me and I here take the liberty of giving my sentiments concerning it I must freely acknowledge that Mr Pope's invention is very lively though he seems to have been guilty of the same fault into which he owns we are often precipitated by our invention when we depend too much upon the strength of it as magnanimity says he may run up to confusion and extravagance so may great invention to redundancy and wildness  'This has been the very case of Mr Pope himself nothing is more overstrained or more false  than the images in which his fancy has represented Homer sometimes he tells us that the Iliad is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater Sometimes he compares him to a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind and lastly he represents him under the notion of a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit but bears too many branches which might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance  'What is Homer's poem then according to Mr Pope a confused heap of beauties without order or symmetry and a plot whereon nothing but seeds nor nothing perfect or formed is to be found and a production loaded with many unprofitable things which ought to be retrenched and which choak and disfigure those which deserve to be preserved Mr Pope will pardon me if I here oppose those comparisons which to me appear very false and entirely contrary to what the greatest of ancient and modern critics ever thought  'The Iliad is so far from being a wild paradise that it is the most regular garden and laid out with more symmetry than any ever was Every thing therein is not only in the place it ought to have been but every thing is fitted for the place it hath He presents you at first with that which ought to be first seen he places in the middle what ought to be in the middle and what would be improperly placed at the beginning or end and he removes what ought to be at a greater distance to create the more agreeable surprize and to use a comparison drawn from painting he places that in the greatest light which cannot be too visible and sinks in the obscurity of the shade what does  not require a full view so that it may be said that Homer is the Painter who best knew how to employ the shades and lights The second comparison is equally unjust how could Mr Pope say  'that one can only discover seeds and the first productions of every kind in the Iliad'  every beauty is there to such an amazing perfection that the following ages could add nothing to those of any kind and the ancients have always proposed Homer as the most perfect model in every kind of poetry  'The third comparison is composed of the errors of the two former Homer had certainly an incomparable fertility of invention but his fertility is always checked by that just sense which made him reject every superfluous thing which his vast imagination could offer and to retain only what was necessary and useful Judgment guided the hand of this admirable gardener and was the pruning hook he employed to lop off every useless branch'  Thus far Madam Dacier differs in her opinion from Mr Pope concerning Homer but these remarks which we have just quoted partake not at all of the nature of criticism they are meer assertion Pope had declared Homer to abound with irregular beauties Dacier has contradicted him and asserted that all his beauties are regular but no reason is assigned by either of these mighty geniuses in support of their opinions and the reader is left in the dark as to the real truth If he is to be guided by the authority of a name only no doubt the argument will preponderate in favour of our countryman The French lady then proceeds to answer some observations which Mr Pope made upon her Remarks on the Iliad which she performs with a warmth that generally attends writers of her sex Mr Pope however paid more regard to this fair antagonist than any other critic  upon his works He confessed that he had received great helps from her and only thought she had through a prodigious and almost superstitious fondness for Homer endeavoured to make him appear without any fault or weakness and stamp a perfection on his works which is no where to be found He wrote her a very obliging letter in which he conf  ssed himself exceedingly sorry that he ever should have displeased so excellent a wit and she on the other hand with a goodness and frankness prculiar to her protested to forgive it so that there remained no animosities between those two great admirers and translators of Homer  Mr Pope by his succes  ful translation of the Iliad as we have before remarked drew upon him the envy and raillery of a whole tribe of writers Though he did not esteem any particular man amongst his enemies of consequence enough to provoke an answer yet when they were considered collectively they offered excellent materials for a general satire This satire he planned and executed with so extraordinary a mastery that it is by far the most compleat poem of our author's it discovers more invention and a higher effort of genius toan any other production of his The  int was taken from Mr Dryden's Mac  lecknoe but as it is more general so it is more pleasing The Dunciad is so universally read that we reckon it superfiuous to give any further account of it here and it would be an unpleasing task to trace all the provocations and resentments which were mutually discovered upon this occasion Mr Pope was of opinion that next to praising good writers there was a merit in exposing bad ones though it does not hold infallibly true that each person stigmatized as a dunce was genuinely so Something must be allowed to personal resentment Mr Pope was a man of keen passions he felt an injury strongly retained a long remembrance of it and  could very pungently repay it Some of the gentlemen however who had been more severely lashed than the rest meditated a revenge which redounds but little to their honour They either intended to chastize him corporally or gave it out that they had really done so in order to bring shame upon Mr Pope which if true could only bring shame upon themselves  While Mr Pope enjoyed any leisure from severer applications to study his friends were continually solliciting him to turn his thoughts towards something that might be of lasting use to the world and engage no more in a war with dunces who were now effectually humbled Our great dramatic poet Shakespear had pass'd through several hands some of whom were very reasonably judged not to have understood any part of him tolerably much less were capable to correct or revise him  The friends of Mr Pope therefore strongly importuned him to undertake the whole of Shakespear's plays and if possible by comparing all the different copies now to be procured restore him to his ancient purity To which our poet made this modest reply that not having attempted any thing in the Drama it might in him be deemed too much presumption To which he was answered that this did not require great knowledge of the foundation and disposition of the drama as that must stand as it was and Skakespear himself had not always paid strict regard to the rules of it but this was to clear the scenes from the rubbish with which ignorant editors had filled them  His proper business in this work was to render the text so clear as to be generally understood to free it from obscurities and sometimes gross absurdities which now seem to appear in it and to explain doubtful and difficult passages of which there are great numbers This however was an arduous province and how Mr Pope has acquitted himself  in it has been differently determined It is certain he never valued himself upon that performance nor was it a task in the least adapted to his genius for it seldom happens that a man of lively parts can undergo the servile drudgery of collecting passages in which more industry and labour are necessary than persons of quick penetration generally have to bestow  It has been the opinion of some critics that Mr Pope's talents were not adapted for the drama otherwise we cannot well account for his neglecting the most gainful way of writing which poetry affords especially as his reputation was so high that without much ceremony or mortification he might have had any piece of his brought upon the stage Mr Pope was attentive to his own interest and if he had not either been conscious of his inability in that province or too timid to wish the popular approbation he would certainly have attempted the drama Neither was he esteemed a very competent judge of what plays were proper or improper for representation He wrote several letters to the manager of DruryLane Theatre in favour of Thomson's Agamemnon which notwithstanding his approbation Thomson's friends were obliged to mutulate and shorten and after all it proved a heavy playThough it was generally allowed to have been one of the best acted plays that had appeared for some years  He was certainly concerned in the Comedy which was published in Mr Gay's name called Three Hours after Marriage as well as Dr Arbuthnot This illustrious triumvirate though men of the most various parts and extensive understanding yet were not able it seems to please the people tho' the principal parts were supported by the best actors in that way on the stage Dr Arbuthnot and Mr Pope were no doubt solicitous to conceal their concern in it but by a letter which Gay wrote to Pope published  in Ayre's Memoirs it appears evident if Ayre's authority may be depended on that they both assisted in the composition  DEAR POPE  'Too late I see and confess myself mistaken in relation to the Comedy yet I do not think had I followed your advice and only introduced the mummy that the absence of the crocodile had saved it I can't help laughing myself though the vulgar do not consider it was designed to look ridiculous to think how the poor monster and mummy were dashed at their reception and when the cry was loudest I thought that if the thing had been written by another I should have deemed the town in some measure mistaken and as to your apprehension that this may do us future injury do not think of it the Dr has a more valuable name than can be hurt by any thing of this nature and your's is doubly safe I will if any shame there be take it all to myself and indeed I ought the motion being first mine and never heartily approved by you'  Of all our poet's writings none were read with more general approbation than his Ethic Epistles or multiplied into more editions Mr Pope who was a perfect oeconomist secured to himself the profits arising from his own works he was never subjected to necessity and therefore was not to be imposed upon by the art or fraud of publishers  But now approaches the period in which as he himself expressed it he stood in need of the generous tear he paid  Poets themselves must fall like those they sung  Deaf the prais'd ear and mute the tuneful tongue  Ev'n he whose soul now melts in mournful lays  Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays  Mr Pope who had been always subjected to a variety of bodily infirmities finding his strength give way began to think that his days which had been prolonged past his expectation were drawing towards a conclusion However he visited the HotWells at Bristol where for some time there were small hopes of his recovery but making too free with purges he grew worse and seemed desirous to draw nearer home A dropsy in the breast at last put a period to his life at the age of on the th of May at his house at Twickenham where he was interred in the same grave with his father and mother  Mr Pope's behaviour in his last illness has been variously represented to the world Some have affirmed that it was timid and peevish that having been fixed in no particular system of faith his mind was wavering and his temper broken and disturb'd Others have asserted that he was all chearfulness and resignation to the divine will Which of these opinions is true we cannot now determine but if the former it must be regretted that he who had taught philosophy to others should himself be destitute of its assistance in the most critical moments of his life  The bulk of his fortune he bequeath'd to Mrs Blount with whom he lived in the strictest friendship and for whom he is said to have entertained the warmest affection His works which are in the hands of every person of true taste and will last as long as our language will be understood render unnecessary all further remarks on his writings He was equally admired for the dignity and sublimity of his moral and philosophical works the vivacity of his satirical the clearness and propriety of his didactic the richness and variety of his discriptive and the elegance of all added to an harmony of versification and correctness of sentiment and language unknown to our former poets  and of which he has set an example which will be an example or a reproach to his successors His prosestile is as perfect in its kind as his poetic and has all the beauties proper for it joined to an uncommon force and perspicuity  Under the profession of the RomanCatholic religion to which he adhered to the last he maintained all the moderation and charity becoming the most thorough and consistent Protestant His conversation was natural easy and agreeable without any affectation of displaying his wit or obtruding his own judgment even upon subjects of which he was so eminently a master  The moral character of our author as it did not escape the lash of his calumniators in his life so have there been attempts since his death to diminish his reputation Lord Bolingbroke whom Mr Pope esteemed to almost an enthusiastic degree of admiration was the first to make this attack Not many years ago the public were entertained with this controversy immediately upon the publication of his lordship's Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism and the Idea of a Patriot King Different opinions have been offered some to extenuate the fault of Mr Pope for printing and mutilating these letters without his lordship's knowledge others to blame him for it as the highest breach of friendship and the greatest mark of dishonour It would exceed our proposed bounds to enter into the merits of this controversy the reader no doubt will find it amply discussed in that account of the life of this great author which Mr Warburton has promised the public  This great man is allowed to have been one of the first rank amongst the poets of our nation and to acknowledge the superiority of none but Shakespear Milton and Dryden With the two former it is unnatural to compare him as their province in writing is so very different Pope has never attempted  the drama nor published an Epic Poem in which these two distinguished genius's have so wonderfully succeeded Though Pope's genius was great it was yet of so different a cast from Shakespear's and Milton's that no comparison can be justly formed But if this may be said of the former two it will by no means hold with respect to the la  ter for between him and Dryden there is a great similarity of writing and a very striking coincidence of genius It will not perhaps be unpleasing to our readers if we pursue this comparison and endeavour to discover to whom the superiority is justly to be attributed and to which of them poetry owes the highest obligations  When Dryden came into the world he found poetry in a very imperfect state its numbers were unpolished its cadences rough and there was nothing of harmony or mellifluence to give it a graceful of flow In this harsh unmusical situation Dryden found it for the refinements of Waller were but puerile and unsubstantial he polished the rough diamond he taught it to shine and connected beauty elegance and strength in all his poetical compositions Though Dryden thus polished our English numbers and thus harmonized versification it cannot be said that he carried his art to perfection Much was yet left undone his lines with all their smoothness were often rambling and expletives were frequently introduced to compleat his measures It was apparent therefore that an additional harmony might still be given to our numbers and that cadences were yet capable of a more musical modulation To effect this purpose Mr Pope arose who with an ear elegantly delicate and the advantage of the finest genius so harmonized the English numbers as to make them compleatly musical His numbers are likewise so minutely correct that it would be difficult to conceive how any of his lines can be altered  to advantage He has created a kind of mechanical versification every line is alike and though they are sweetly musical they want diversity for he has not studied so great a variety of pauses and where the accents may be laid gracefully The structure of his verse is the best and a line of his is more musical than any other line can be made by placing the accents elsewhere but we are not quite certain whether the ear is not apt to be soon cloy'd with this uniformity of elegance this sameness of harmony It must be acknowledged however that he has much improved upon Dryden in the article of versification and in that part of poetry is greatly his superior But though this must be acknowledged perhaps it will not necessarily follow that his genius was therefore superior  The grand characteristic of a poet is his invention the surest distinction of a great genius In Mr Pope nothing is so truly original as his Rape of the Lock nor discovers so much invention In this kind of mockheroic he is without a rival in our language for Dryden has written nothing of the kind His other work which discovers invention fine designing and admirable execution is his Dunciad which tho' built on Dryden's Mac Flecknoe is yet so much superior that in satiric writing the Palm must justly be yielded to him In Mr Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel there are indeed the most poignant strokes of satire and characters drawn with the most masterly touches but this poem with all its excellencies is much inferior to the Dunciad though Dryden had advantages which Mr Pope had not for Dryden's characters are men of great eminence and figure in the state while Pope has to expose men of obscure birth and unimportant lives only distinguished from the herd of mankind by a glimmering of genius which rendered the greatest part of them more emphatically contemptible Pope's was the hardest  task and he has executed it with the greatest success As Mr Dryden must undoubtedly have yielded to Pope in satyric writing it is incumbent on the partizans of Dryden to name a other species of composition in which the former excells so as to throw the ballance again upon the side of Dryden This species is the Lyric in which the warmest votaries of Pope must certainly acknowledge that he is much inferior as an irresistable proof of this we need only compare Mr Dryden's Ode on St Cecilia's Day with Mr Pope's in which the cupasity is so apparent that we know not if the most finished of Pope's compositions has discovered such a variety and command of numbers  It hath been generally acknowledged that the Lyric is a more excellent kind of writing than the Satiric and consequently he who excells in the most excellent species must undoubtedly be esteemed the greatest poetMr Pope has very happily succeeded in many of his occasional pieces such as Eloisa to Abelard his Elegy on an unfortunate young Lady and a variety of other performances deservedly celebrated To these may be opposed Mr Dryden's Fables which though written in a very advanced age are yet the most perfect of his works In these Fables there is perhaps a greater variety than in Pope's occasional pieces Many of them indeed are translations but such as are original shew a great extent of invention and a large compass of genius  There are not in Pope's works such poignant discoveries of wit or such a general knowledge of the humours and characters of men as in the Prologues and Epilogues of Dryden which are the best records of the whims and capriclous oddities of the times in which they are written  When these two great genius's are considered in the light of translators it will indeed be difficult to determine into whose scale the ballance should  be thrown That Mr Pope had a more arduous province in doing justice to Homer than Dryden with regard to Virgil is certainly true as Homer is a more various and diffuse poet than Virgil and it is likewise true that Pope has even exceeded Dryden in the execution and none will deny that Pope's Homer's Iliad is a finer poem than Dryden's Aeneis of Virgil Making a proper allowance for the disproportion of the original authors But then a candid critic should reflect that as Dryden was prior in the great attempt of tendering Virgil into English so did he perform the task under many disadvantages which Pope by a happier situation in life was enabled to avoid and could not but improve upon Dryden's errors though the authors translated were not the same And it is much to be doubted if Dryden were to translate the Aeneid now with that attention which the correctness of the present age would force upon him whether the preference would be due to Pope's Homer  But supposing it to be yielded as it certainly must that the latter bard was the greatest translator we are now to throw into Mr Dryden's scale all his dramatic works which though not the most excellent of his writings yet as nothing of Mr Pope's can be opposed to them they have an undoubted right to turn the ballance greatly in favour of Mr DrydenWhen the two poets are considered as critics the comparison will very imperfectly hold Dryden's Dedications and Prefaces besides that they are more numerous and are the best models for courtly panegyric shew that he understood poetry as an art beyond any man that ever lived And he explained this art so well that he taught his antagonists to turn the tables against himself for he so illuminaced the mind by his clear and perspicuous reasoning that dullness itself became capable of discerning and when at any  time his performances fell short of his own ideas of excellence his enemies tried him by rules of his own establishing and though they owed to him the ability of judging they seldom had candour enough to spare him  Perhaps it may be true that Pope's works are read with more appetite as there is a greater evenness and correctness in them but in perusing the works of Dryden the mind will take a wider range and be more fraught with poetical ideas We admire Dryden as the greater genius and Pope as the most pleasing versifier  ERRATA in the foregoing life viz  P l for with all that the world

esq  of MalmsburyAbbey in Wiltshire a gentleman possessed of an estate of about l a year which was entailed upon him and the eldest son and to his heirs for many descents  the unhappy misconduct of Mr George Hill and the weakness of the trustees entangled it in such a manner as hitherto has rendered it of no advantage to his family for without any legal title so to do he sold it all at different times for sums greatly beneath the value of it and left his children to their mother's care and her mother's Mrs Ann Gregory who took great pains with her grandson's education At nine years old she put  him to school to Mr Rayner at Barnstable in Devonshire from whence he went to Westminster school where soon under the care of Dr Knipe his genius shewed itself in a distinguished light and often made him some amends for his hard fortune which denied him such supplies of pocketmoney as his spirit wished by enabling him to perform the tasks of many who had not his capacity  Mr Aaron Hill was born in BeaufortBuildings in the Strand on February At fourteen years of age he left Westminster school and shortly after hearing his grandmother make mention of a relation much esteemed lord Paget then ambassador at Constantinople he formed a resolution of paying him a visit there being likewise very desirous to see that empire  His grandmother being a woman of uncommon understanding and great goodnature would not oppose him in it and accordingly he soon embark'd on board a ship then going there March as appears by a Journal which he kept during his voyage and in his travels though at so weak an age wherein he gave the most accurate account of every particular in a manner much above his years  When he arrived lord Paget received him with as much surprize as pleasure wondering that so young a person as he was but then in his fifteenth year  uld chuse to run the hazard of such a voyage to  a relation whom he knew but by character The ambassador immediately provided for him a very learned ecclesiastic in his own house and under his tuition sent him to travel being desirous to improve as far as possible the education of a person he found worthy of it With this tutor he had the opportunity of seeing Egypt Palestine and a great part of the Eastern country  With lord Paget he returned home about the year through great part of Europe in which tour he saw most of the courts  He was in great esteem with that nobleman insomuch that in all probability he had been still more distinguished by him at his death than in his life time had not the envious fears and malice of a certain female who was in high authority and favour with that lord prevented and supplanted his kind disposition towards him My lord took great pleasure in instructing him himself wrote him whole books in different languages on which his student placed the greatest value which was no sooner taken notice of by jealous observation than they were stolen from his apartment and suffered to be some days missing to the great displeasure of my lord but still much greater affliction of his pupil whose grief for losing a treasure he so highly valued was more than doubled by perceiving that from some false insinuation that had been made it was believed he had himself wilfully lost them But young Mr Hill was soon entirely cleared on this head  A few years after he was desired both on account of his sobriety and understanding to accompany Sir William Wentworth a worthy baronet of Yorkshire who was then going to make the tour of Europe with whom he travelled two or three years and brought him home improved to the satisfaction of that gentleman's relations  'Twas in those different travels he collected matter for the history he wrote of Turky and published in a work he afterwards often  pented having printed and though his o  would criticise upon it with much severity But as he used to say he was a very boy when he began and ended it therefore great allowance may be made on that account and in a letter which has since been printed in his works wrote to his greatly valued friend the worthy author of Clarissa he acknowledges his consciousness of such defects where speaking of obscurity he says  'Obscurity indeed if they had penetration to mean that is burying sense alive and some of my rash early too affected puerile scriblings must and should have pleaded guilty to so just an accusation'  The fire of youth with an imagination lively as his was seldom if ever go hand in hand with solid judgment Mr Hill did not give himself indeed time for correction having wrote it so very expeditiously as hardly would be credited But as Dr Sprat then bishop of Rochester used to observe there is certainly visible in that book the seeds of a great writerHe seldom in his riper years was guilty of the fault of noncorrection for he revis'd too strictly rather every piece he purposed for the public eye exclusive of an author's natural fondness and it has been believed by many who have read some of his pieces in the first copy that had they never been by a revisal deepned into greater strength they would have pleased still more at least more generally  About the year he published his first poem called Camillus in vindication and honour of the earl of Peterborough who had been general in Spain After that nobleman had seen it he was desirous to know who was the author of it which having found by enquiry he complimented him by making him his secretary in the room of Mr Furly who was gon  abroad with another nobleman And Mr Hill was always held in high esteem with that great peer with whom however he did not continue long for in the year he married the only daughter of Edmund Morris  Esq  of Stratford in Essex with whom he had a very handsome fortune By her he had nine children four of whom a son and three daughters are still living  In he was made master of the Theatre in DruryLane and then at the desire of Mr Barton Booth wrote his first Tragedy Elfrid or the Fair  Inconstant which from his first beginning of it he compleated in a little more than a weekThe following year he was master of the Opera House in the HayMarket and then wrote an Opera called Rinaldo which met with great success It was the first which that admirable genius Mr Handel compos'd after he came to England this he dedicated to Queen AnneHis genius was adapted greatly to the business of the stage and while he held the management he conducted both Theatres intirely to the satisfaction of the publicBut in a few months he relinquished it from some misunderstanding with the then lord chamberlain and though he was soon after sollicited to take that charge again upon him by a person the highest in command he still declined it  From that time he bent his thoughts on studies far more solid and desirable to him to views of public benefit For his mind was ardently devoted to the pursuit of general improvement But as one genius seldom is adapted to both theory and practice so in the execution of a variety of undertakings the most advantageous in themselves by some mismanagement of those concerned with him he fail'd of the success his labours merited  As in particular in an affair he set on foot about the year and was the sole discoverer of for which he had a patent the making of an Oil as sweet as that from Olives from the BeechNuts But this being an undertaking of a great extent he was obliged to work conjointly with other men's assistance and materials whence arose disputes among them which terminated in the overthrowing the advantage then arising from it which otherwise might have been great and lasting  This has occasioned that affair to be misunderstood by many it therefore may not be thought improper here to set it in a juster light and this cannot more exactly be given than from his own  words called A fair state of the Account published in the year  'An impartial state of the case between the patentee annuitants and sharers in the BeechOilCompany'Some part of which is here recited  'The disappointments of the BeechOilCompany this year have made abundance of sharers peevish the natural effect of peevishness is clamour and clamour like a tide will work itself a passage where it has no right of flowing some gentlemen misled by false conceptions both of the affair and its direction have driven their discontent through a mistaken chanel and inclined abundance who are strangers to the truth to accuse the patentee of faults he is not only absolutely free from but by which he is of all concern'd the greatest sufferer  'But he is not angry with the angry he considers they must take things as they hear them represented he governs all his actions by this general maxim never to be moved at a reproach unless it be a just one  'In October the patentee procured a grant for fourteen years to him and his assigns for the BeechOil invention  'Anno he made and published proposals for taking a subscription of l upon the following conditions  'That every subscriber should receive by half yearly payments at LadyDay and Michaelmas during the continuance of the patent from LadyDay inclusive an annuity amounting to fiftypound per cent for any sum subscribed excepting a deduction for the payment of the directors  'That nine directors should be chosen on midsummerday who should receive complaints upon nonpayments of annuities and in such case upon refusal any five of the nine directors had power to meet and chuse a governor from among themselves enrolling that choice in chancery together with the reasons for it  'That after such choice and enrollment the patentee should stand absolutely excluded the business be carried on and all the right of the grant be vested not as a mortgage but as a sale without redemption in the governor so chosen for the joint advantage of the annuitants in proportion to their several interests  'As a security for making good the articles the patentee did by indenture enrolled in chancery assign and make over his patent to trustees in the indenture named for the uses above mentioned  'In the mean time the first half yearly payments to the annuitants amounting to l became due and the company not being yet compleated the patentee himself discharged it and has never reckon'd that sum to the account between him and the company which he might have done by virtue of the articles on which he gave admission to the sharers  'For the better explanation of this scheme it will be necessary to observe that while the shares were selling he grew apprehensive that the season would be past before the fifty pounds per share they were to furnish by the articles could be contributed He therefore gave up voluntarily and for the general good l of his own guineas purchase money as a loan to the company till the expiration of the patent after which it was again to be made good to him or his assigns and this money so lent by the patentee is all the stock that ever has been hitherto employed by the company  'But instead of making good the abovementioned conditional covenant the board proceeded to unnecessary warmth and sound themselves involved still more and more in animosities and those irregularities which naturally follow groundless controversy He would therefore take upon himself the hazard and the power of the whole affair accountable however to the board as to the money  part and yet would bind himself to pay for three years to come a profit of forty shillings per annum upon every share and then deliver back the business to the general care above the reach of future disappointments  'What reasons the gentlemen might have to refuse so inviting an offer is best known to themselves but they absolutely rejected that part of it which was to fix the sole power of management in the patentee Upon which and many other provocations afterward becoming more and more dissatisfied he thought sit to demand repayment of five hundred pounds which he had lent the company as he had several other sums before and not receiving it but on the contrary being denied so much as an acknowledgment that it was due withdrew himself intirely from the board and left them to their measures  'Thus at the same time have I offered my defence and my opinion By the first I am sure I shall be acquitted from all imputations and confirmed in the good thoughts of the concerned on either side who will know for the future what attention they should give to idle reflections and the falsehood of rumour and from the last I have hopes that a plan may be drawn which will settle at once all disputed pretensions and restore that fair prospect which the open advantage of last year's success indifferent as it was has demonstrated to be a view that was no way chimerical  'They know how to judge of malicious insinuations to my prejudice by this  one most scandalous example  which has been given by the endeavours of some to persuade the outsharers that I have made an extravagant  profit  from the  losses  of the adventurers Whereas on the contrary out of  Twentyfive Thousand Guineas  which was the whole I should have received by the sale of the shares I have given up  Twenty Thousand Pounds  to the use of the company  and to the annuities afterward and three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds more I paid to the annuitants at LadyDay on the company's account and have never demanded it again in consideration of their disappointments the first year  'So that it plainly appears that out of twentyfive thousand guineas I have given away in two articles only twentythree thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds for the public advantage And I can easily prove that the little remainder has been short of making good the charges I have been at for their service by which means I am not one farthing a gainer by the company notwithstanding the clamour and malice of some unthinking adventurers And for the truth of all this I appeal to their own  OfficeBooks  and defy the most angry among them to deny any article of it See then what a grateful and generous encouragement may be expected by men who would dedicate their labours to the profit of others  November the th  A HILL'  This and much more too tedious to insert serves to demonstrate that it was a great misfortune for a mind so fertile of invention and improvement to be embarrassed by a narrow power of fortune too weak alone to execute such undertakings  About the same year he wrote another Tragedy intiled the Fatal Vision  This play he made a present of to the patentee and had several fine scenes painted for it at his own expence He indeed gave all his pieces to the stage never taking any benefit or gratuity from the managers as an author'till his last piece Merope was brought on the stage when unhappy gentleman he was under the necessity of receiving his profits of the third nights which 'till then his generosity and spirit had ever declined  or the Fall of Siam which was acted the same year in Lincoln'sInnFields to which he gave this Motto out of Horace  I not for vulgar admiration write  To be well read not much is my delight  And to his death he would declare in favour of that choiceThat year he likewise published the two first books of an Epic Poem called Gideon founded on a Hebrew Story which like its author and all other authors had its enemies but many more admirers  But his poetic pieces were not frequent in their appearance They were the product of some leisure hours when he relaxed his thoughts from drier study as he took great delight in diving into every useful science viz criticism history geography physic commerce in general agriculture war and law but in particular natural philosophy wherein he has made many and valuable discoveries  Concerning poetry he says in his preface to King Henry the Vth where he laments the want of taste for Tragedy  'But in all events I will be easy who have no better reason to wish well to poetry than my love for a mistress I shall never be married to For whenever I grow ambitious I shall wish to build higher and owe my memory to some occasion of more importance than my writings'  He had acquired so deep an insight in law that he has from his arguments and demonstrations obliged some of the greatest council formally under their hands to retract their own firstgiven opinions  He wrote part of a Tract of War another upon Agriculture but they are left unfinished with several other pieces  In his younger days he bought a grant of Sir Robert Montgomery who had purchas'd it of the lords proprietors of Carolina with whom c he had been concern'd in a design of settling a new  plantation in the South of Carolina of a vast tract of land on which he then designed to pursue the same intentionBut being not master of a fortune equal to that scheme it never proved of any service to him though many years since it has been cultivated largely  Under the name of Georgia    His person was in youth extremely fair and handsome his eyes were a dark blue both bright and penetrating brown hair and visage oval which was enlivened with a smile the most agreeable in conversation where his address was affably engageing to which was joined a dignity which rendered him at once respected and admired by those of either sex who were acquainted with himHe was tall genteelly made and not thinHis voice was sweet his conversation elegant and capable of entertaining upon various subjectsHis disposition was benevolent beyond the power of the fortune he was blessed with the calamities of those he knew and valued as deserving affected him more than his own He had fortitude of mind sufficient to support with calmness great misfortune and from his birth it may be truly said he was obliged to meet it  Of himself he says in his epistle dedicatory to one of his poems  'I am so devoted a lover of a private and unbusy life that I cannot recollect a time wherein I wish'd an increase to the little influence I cultivate in the dignified world unless when I have felt the deficience of my own power to reward some merit that has charm'd me'  His temper though by nature warm when injuries were done him was as nobly forgiving mindful of that great lesson in religion of returning good for evil and he fulfilled it often to the prejudice  of his own circumstances He was a tender husband friend and father one of the best masters to his servants deteiting the too common inhumanity that treats them almost as if they were not fellowcreatures  His manner of life was temperate in all respects which might have promis'd greater length of years late hours excepted which his indefatigable love of study drew him into night being not liable to interruptions like the day  About the year he wrote a poem called the NorthernStar upon the actions of the Czar Peter the Great and several years after he was complimented with a gold medal from the empress Catherine according to the Czar's desire before his death and was to have wrote his life from papers which were to be sent him of the Czar's But the death of the Czarina quickly after prevented itIn an advertisement to the reader in the fifth edition of that poem published in the author says of it  'Though the design was profess'd panegyric I may with modesty venture to say it was not a very politic perhaps but an honest example of praise without flatteryIn the verse I am afraid there was much to be blamed as too low but I am sure there was none of that fault in the purpose The poem having never been hinted either before or after the publication to any person native or foreigner who could be supposed to have interest in or concern for its subject  'In effect it had for six years or more been forgot by myselfand my countrywhen upon the death of the prince it referred to I was surprized by the condescension of a compliment from the empress his relict and immediate successor and thereby first became sensible that the poem had by means of some foreign translation reach'd the eye and regard of that emphatically great monarch in justice to whom it was written'  Soon after he finished six books more of Gideon which made eight of the twelve he purpos'd writing but did not live to finish it  In he brought his Tragedy called King Henry the Vth upon the stage in DruryLane which is as he declares in the preface a new fabric yet built on Shakespear's foundation  In for the advantage of an unhappy gentleman an old officer in the army he wrote a paper in the manner of the Spectators in conjunction with Mr William Bond c intitled the Plain Dealer which were some time after published in two volumes octavo And many of his former writings were appropriated to such humane uses both those to which he has prefixed his name and several others which he wrote and gave away intirely But though the many imagined authors are not living their names and those performances will be omitted here yet in mere justice to the character of Mr Hill we mention this particular  In he made a journey into the North of Scotland where he had been about two years before having contracted with the YorkBuildings Company concerning many woods of great extent in that kingdom for timber for the uses of the navy and many and various were the assertions upon this occasion Some thought and thence reported that there was not a stick in Scotland could be capable of answering that purpose but he demonstrated the contrary For though there was not a great number large enough for masts to ships of the greatest burthen yet there were millions fit for all smaller vessels and planks and bauks proper for every sort of buildingOne ship was built entirely of it and a report was made that never any better timber was brought from any part of the world But he found many difficulties in this undertaking yet had sagacity to overcome them all as far as his own management extended for when the  trees were by his order chain'd together into floats the ignorant Highlanders refus'd to venture themselves on them down the river Spey till he first went himself to make them sensible there was no dangerIn which passage however he found a great obstacle in the rocks by which that river seemed impassible but on these he ordered fires to be made when by the lowness of the river they were most expos'd and then had quantities of water thrown upon them Which method being repeated with the help of proper tools they were broke in pieces and thrown down which made the passage easy for the floats  This affair was carried on to a very good account till those concern'd thought proper to call off the men and horses from the woods of Abernethy in order to employ them in their lead mines in the same country from which they hoped to make greater advantage  The magistrates of Inverness paid him the compliment of making him a present of the freedom of that place at an elegant entertainment made by them on that occasion a favour likewise offered him at Aberdeen c  After a stay of several months in the Highlands during which time he visited the duke and duchess of Gordon who distinguished him with great civilities he went to York and other places in that country where his wife then was with some relations for the recovery of her health but his staying longer there on that account than he intended had like to have proved of unhappy consequence by giving room for some who imagined as they wished that he would not return to be guilty of a breach of trust that aimed at the destruction of great part of what he then was worth but they were disappointed  In that retirement in the North he wrote a poem intitled The Progress of Wit a Caveat for the  use of an eminent Writer It was composed of the genteelest praise and keenest allegorical satire and it gave no small uneasiness to Mr Pope Who had indeed drawn it upon himself by being the aggressor in his DunciadThis afterwards occasioned a private paperwar between those writers in which 'tis generally thought that Mr Hill had greatly the advantage of Mr Pope For the particulars the reader is referred to a shilling pamphlet lately published by Owen containing Letters between Mr Pope and Mr Hill c  The progress of wit begins with the eight following lines wherein the SNEAKINGLY APPROVES affected Mr Pope extreamly  Tuneful Alexis on the Thames' fair side  The Ladies plaything and the Muses pride  With merit popular with wit polite  Easy tho' vain and elegant tho' light  Desiring and deserving other's praise  Poorly accepts a fame he ne'er repays  Unborn to cherish SNEAKINGLY APPROVES  And wants the soul to spread the worth he loves  During their controversy Mr Pope seemed to express his repentance by denying the offence he had given thus in one of his letters he says  'That the letters A H were apply'd to you in the papers I did not know for I seldom read them I heard it only from Mr Savage  Savage was of great use to Mr Pope in helping him to little stories and idle tales of many persons whose names lives and writings had been long since forgot had not Mr Pope mentioned them in his DunciadThis office was too mean for any one but inconsistent Savage Who with a great deal of absurd pride could submit to servile offices and for the vanity of being thought Mr Pope's intimate made no scruple of frequently sacrificing a regard to sincerity or truth He had certainly at one time considerable influence over that great poet but an assuming arrogance at last tired out Mr Pope's patience  as  from yourself and sent my assurances to the contrary But I don't see how the annotator on the D could have rectified that mistake publicly without particularizing your name in a book where I thought it too good to be inserted c  A lame comeoff  '  And in another place he says  'I should imagine the Dunciad meant you a real compliment and so it has been thought by many who have ask'd to whom that passage made that oblique panegyric As to the notes I am weary of telling a great truth which is that I am not author of them c'  Which paragraph was answer'd by the following in Mr Hill's reply  'As to your oblique panegyric I am not under so blind an attachment to the goddess I was devoted to in the Dunciad but that I know it was a commendation though a dirtier one than I wished for who am neither fond of some of the company in which I was listedthe noble reward for which I was to become a diverthe allegorical muddiness in which I was to try my skillnor the institutor of the games you were so kind to allow me a share in c'  A genteel severe reprimand  Much about the same time he wrote another poem called Advice to the Poets in praise of worthy poetry and in censure of the misapplication of poetry in general The following lines here quoted are the motto of it taken from the poem  Shame on your jingling ye soft sons of rhyme  Tuneful consumers of your reader's time  Fancy's light dwarfs whose featherfooted strains  Dance in wild windings thro' a waste of brains  Your's is the guilt of all who judging wrong  Mistake tun'd nonsense for the poet's song  He likewise in this piece reproves the above named celebrated author for descending below his genius and in speaking of the inspiration of the Muse he says  I feel her nowTh' invader fires my breast  And my soul swells to suit the heav'nly guest  Hear her O PopeShe sounds th' inspir'd decree  Thou great ArchAngel of wit's heav'n for thee  Let vulgar genii sour'd by sharp disdain  Piqu'd and malignant words low war maintain  While every meaner art exerts her aim  O'er rival arts to lift her question'd same  Let halfsoul'd poets still on poets fall  And teach the willing world to scorn them all  But let no Muse preeminent as thine  Of voice melodious and of force divine  Stung by wits wasps all rights of rank forego  And turn and snarl and bite at every foe  Nolike thy own Ulysses make no stay  Shun monstersand pursue thy streamy way  In he brought his Tragedy of Athelwold upon the stage in DruryLane which as he says in his preface to it was written on the same subject as his Elfrid or the Fair Inconstant which he there calls  'An unprun'd wilderness of fancy with here and there a flower among the leaves but without any fruit of judgment'  He likewise mentions it as a folly having began and finished Elfrid in a week and both the difference  of time and judgment are visible in favour of the last of those performances  That year he met the greatest shock that affliction ever gave him in the loss of one of the most worthy of wives to whom he had been married above twenty years  The following epitaph he wrote and purpos'd for a monument which he designed to erect over her grave  Enough cold stone suffice her longlov'd name  Words are too weak to pay her virtues claim  Temples and tombs and tongues shall waste away  And power's vain pomp in mould'ring dust decay  But e'er mankind a wife more perfect see  Eternity O Time shall bury thee  He was a man susceptible of love in its sublimest sense as may be seen in that poetical description of that passion which he has given in his poem called the Picture of Love wrote many years ago from whence the following two lines are taken  No wild desire can this proud bliss bestow  Souls must be match'd in heav'n tho' mix'd below  About the year he was concern'd with another gentleman in writing a paper called the Prompter all those mark'd with a B were hisThis was meant greatly for the service of the stage and many of them have been regarded in the highest mannerBut as there was not only instruction but reproof the bitter with the sweet by some could not be relish'd  In having translated from the French of Monsieur de Voltaire the Tragedy of Zara he gave it to be acted for the benefit of Mr William  Bond and it was represented first at the LongRoom in VillarsStreet YorkBuildings where that poor gentleman performed the part of Lusignan the old expiring king a character he was at that time too well suited to being and looking almost dead as in reality he was before the run of it was overSoon after this play was brought upon the stage in DruryLane by Mr Fleetwood at the earnest sollicitation of Mr Theophilus Cibber the part of Zara was played by Mrs Cibber and was her first attempt in Tragedy of the performers therein he makes very handsome mention in the preface This play he dedicated to his royal highness the Prince of Wales  The same year was acted at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields another Tragedy of his translating from the same French author called Alzira which was likewise dedicated to the PrinceHis dedications generally wore a different face from those of other writers he there most warmly recommends Monsieur de Voltaire as worthy of his royal highness's partiality disclaiming for himself all expectations of his notice But he was notwithstanding particularly honoured with his approbation  These plays if not a litteral translation have been thought much better for their having past his hands as generously was acknowledged by Monsieur de Voltaire himself  In he published a poem called The Tears of the Muses composed of general satire in the address to the reader he says speaking of satire  'There is indeed something so like cruelty in the face of that species of poetry that it can only be reconciled to humanity by the general benevolence of its purpose attacking particulars for the public advantage'  The following year he wrote in prose a book called An Enquiry into the Merit of Assassination with a View to the Character of Caesar and his Designs on the Roman Republic  About this time he in a manner left the world though living near so populous a part of it as London and settled at Plaistow in Essex where he entirely devoted himself to his study family and garden and the accomplishment of many profitable views particularly one in which for years he had laboured through experiments in vain and when he brought it to perfection did not live to reap the benefit of it The discovery of the art of making potash like the Russian which cost this nation yearly an immense sum of money  In the year he published The Fanciad an Heroic Poem inscribed to his grace the duke of Marlborough Who as no name was then prefixed to it perhaps knew not the author by whom he was distinguished in it  Soon after he wrote another intitled the Impartial which he inscribed in the same manner to the lord Carteret now earl of Granville In the beginning of it are the following lines  Burn sooty slander burn thy blotted scroll  Greatness is greatness spite of faction's soul  Deep let my soul detest th' adhesive pride  That changing sentiment unchanges side  It would be tedious to enumerate the variety of smaller pieces he at different times was author of  His notions of the deity were boundlessly extensive and the few lines here quoted from his Poem upon faith published in must give the best idea of his sentiments upon that most elevated of all subjects  What then must be believ'dBelieve God kind  To fear were to offend him Fill thy heart  With his felt laws and act the good he loves  Rev'rence his power Judge him but by his works  Know him but in his mercies Rev'rence too  The most mistaken schemes that mean his praise  Rev'rence his priestsfor ev'ry priest is his  Who finds him in his conscience  This year he published his Art of Acting a Poem deriving Rules from a new Principle for touching the Passions in a natural Manner c Which was dedicated to the Earl of Chesterfield  Having for many years been in a manner forgetful of the eight Books he had finished of his Epic Poem called Gideonin he reperused that work and published three of the Books to which he gave the name of Gideon or the PatriotThey were inscribed to the late lord Bolingbroke to whom he accounts as follows for the alterations he had made since the first publication of two Books  Erring where thousands err'd in youth's hot smart  Propulsive prejudice had warp'd his heart  Bold and too loud he sigh'd for high distress  Fond of the fall'n nor form'd to serve success  Partial to woes had weigh'd their cause too light  Wept o'er misfortuneand misnam'd it right  Anguish attracting turn'd attachment wrong  And pity's note mistun'd his devious song  'Tis much lamented by many who are admirers of that species of poetry that the author did not finish it  The same year after a length of different applications for several seasons at both Theatres without  success his Tragedy called Merope was brought upon the stage in DruryLane by Mr Garrick to whom as well as to another gentleman he likewise highly both admired and esteemed he was greatly obliged and his own words here borrowed will shew how just a sense he had of these obligationsThey begin the preface to the play  'If there can be a pride that ranks with virtues it is that we feel from friendships with the worthy Mr Mallet therefore must forgive me that I boast the honour he has done my MeropeI have so long been a retreater from the world that one of the best spirits in it told me lately I had made myself an alien there I must confess I owe so many obligations to its ornaments of most distinguished genius that I must have looked upon it as a great unhappiness to have made choice of solitude could I have judged society in general by a respect so due to these adorners of it'  And in relation to this Tragedy he says after very justly censuring Monsieur de Voltaire for representing in the preface to his Merope the English as incapable of Tragedy  'To such provoking stimulations I have owed inducement to retouch for Mr Voltaire's use the characters in his high boasted Merope and I have done it on a plan as near his own as I could bring it with a safe conscience that is to say without distaste to English audiences  This he likewise dedicated to lord Bolingbroke and was the last he ever wroteThere is a melancholy thread of fatal prophecy in the beginning of it of his own approaching dissolution  Cover'd in fortune's shade I rest reclin'd  My griefs all silent and my joys resign'd  With patient eye life's evening gloom survey  Nor shake th' outhast'ning sands nor bid 'em stay  Yet while from life my setting prospects fly  Fain wou'd my mind's weak offspring shun to die  Fain wou'd their hope some light through time explore  The name's kind pasportWhen the man's no more  From about the time he was solliciting the bringing on this play an illness seized him from the tormenting pains of which he had scarce an hour's intermission and after making trial of all he thought could be of service to him in medicine he was desirous to try his native air of London as that of Plaistow was too moist a one but he was then past all recovery and wasted almost to a skeleton from some internal cause that had produced a general decay and was believed to have been an inflamation in the kidneys which his intense attachment to his studies might probably lay the foundation ofWhen in town he had the comfort of being honoured with the visits of the most worthy and esteemed among his friends but he was not permitted many weeks to taste that blessing  The same humane and generous Mr Mallet who had before aided his Merope about this time was making inter  st for its being played again for the advantage of its authorHis royal highness the prince of Wales had the great goodness to command it and Mr Hill just lived to express his grateful acknowledgments to those about him upon hearing of itBut on the day before it was to be represented he died in the very minute of the earthquake February the eighth which he seemed sensible of though then deprived of utterance Had he lived two days longer he had been sixtyfive years oldHe endur'd a twelvemonth's torment of the body with a calmness that confess'd a superiority of soul He was interred in  the same grave with her the most dear to him when living in the great cloister of WestministerAbbey near the lord Godolphin's tomb  It may be truly said of Mr Hill he was a great and general writer and had he been possest of the estate he was intitled to his liberality had been no less extensive than his genius But often do we see misfortune's clouds obscure the brightest sunshine  Besides his works which here have been enumerated there are several other particularly two poems intitled the Creation and the JudgmentDay which were published many years agoAnother in blank verse he published in the time of his retreat into Essex it was called Cleon to Lycidas a Time Piece the date not marked by the printer  Some years before his death he talked of making a collection of his works for publication but postponed it for the finishing some pieces which he did not live to effect  Since his death four volumes of them have been published by subscription for his family He left one Tragedy never yet acted which was wrote originally about and intitled Caesar but since he has named it the Roman RevengeBut as the author was avowedly a great admirer of Caesar's character not in the light he is generally understood that of a tyrant but in one much more favourable he was advised by several of the first distinction both in rank and judgment to make such alterations in it as should adapt it more to the general opinion and upon that advice he in a manner new wrote the play But as most first opinions are not easily eradicated it has been never able to make a public trial of the success which many of the greatest understanding have pronounced it highly worthy ofThe late lord Bolingbroke in a letter wrote to the author has called it one of the noblest drama's that our language or any age can boast  These few little speeches are taken from the part of Caesar  'Tis the great mind's expected pain Calphurnia  To labour for the thanklessHe who seeks  Reward in ruling makes ambition guilt  And living for himself disclaims mankind  And thus speaking to Mark Anthony  If man were placed above the reach of insult  To pardon were no virtueThink warm Anthony  What mercy is'Tis daring to be wrong'd  Yet unprovok'd by pride persist in pity  This again to Calphurnia  No matterVirtue triumphs by neglect  Vice while it darkens lends but foil to brightness  And juster times removing slander's veil  Wrong'd merit after death is help'd to live  Mr LEWIS THEOBALD  THIS gentleman was born at Sittingburn in Kent of which place his father Mr Peter Theobald was an eminent attorney His grammatical learning he received chiefly under the revd Mr Ellis at Isleworth in Middlesex and afterwards  applied himself to the study and practice of the law but finding that study too tedious and irksome for his genius he quitted it for the profession of poetry He engaged in a paper called the Censor published in Mist's Weekly Journal and by delivering his opinion with two little reserve concerning some eminent wits he exposed himself to their lashes and resentment Upon the publication of Pope's Homer he praised it in the most extravagant terms of admiration but afterwards thought proper to retract his opinion for reasons we cannot guess and abused the very performance he had before hyperbollically praised  Mr Pope at first made Mr Theobald the hero of his Dunciad but afterwards for reasons best known to himself he thought proper to disrobe him of that dignity and bestow it upon another with what propriety we shall not take upon us to determine but refer the reader to Mr Cibber's two letters to Mr Pope He was made hero of the poem the annotator informs us because no better was to be had In the first book of the Dunciad Mr Theobald or Tibbald as he is there called is thus stigmatised  Dullness her image full exprest  But chief in Tibbald's monsterbreeding breast  Sees Gods with Daemons in strange league engage  And Earth and heav'n and hell her battles wage  She eyed the bard where supperless he sate  And pin'd unconscious of his rising fate  Studious he sate with all his books around  Sinking from thought to thought a vast profound  Plung'd for his sense but found no bottom there  Then writ and flounder'd on in meer despair  He roll'd his eyes that witness'd huge dismay  Where yet unpawn'd much learned lumber lay  He describes Mr Theobald as making the following address to Dulness  For thee  Old puns restore lost blunders nicely seek  And crucify poor Shakespear once aweek  For thee I dim these eyes and stuff this head  With all such reading as was never read  For thee supplying in the worst of days  Notes to dull books and prologues to dull plays  For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it  And write about it goddess and about it  So spins the silkworm small its slender store  And labours till it clouds itself all o'er  In the year Mr Theobald published a piece in octavo called Shakespear Restored Of this it is said he was so vain as to aver in one of Mist's Journals June the th  'That to expose any errors in it was impracticable'  and in another April the th  'That whatever care might for the future be taken either by Mr Pope or any other assistants he would give above fivehundred emendations that would escape them all'  During two whole years while Mr Pope was preparing his edition he published advertisements requesting assistance and promising satisfaction to any who would contribute to its greater perfection But this restorer who was at that time solliciting fa  ours of him by letters did wholly conceal that he had any such design till after its publication which he owned in the Daily Journal of November and then an outery was made that Mr Pope had joined with the bookseller to raise an extravagant subscription in which he had no share  of which he had no knowledge and against which he had publickly advertised in his own proposals for Homer  Mr Theobald was not only thus obnoxious to the resentment of Pope but we find him waging war with Mr Dennis who treated him with more roughness though with less satire Mr Theobald in the Censor Vol II No XXXIII calls Mr Dennis by the name of Furius  'The modern Furius says he is to be looked upon as more the object of pity than that which he daily provokes laughter and contempt Did we really know how much this poor man suffers by being contradicted or which is the same thing in effect by hearing another praised we should in compassion sometimes attend to him with a silent nod and let him go away with the triumphs of his illnature Poor Furius where any of his cotemporaries are spoken well of quitting the ground of the present dispute steps back a thousand years to call in the succour of the antients His very panegyric is spiteful and he uses it for the same reason as some ladies do their commendations of a dead beauty who never would have had their good word but that a living one happened to be mentioned in their company His applause is not the tribute of his heart but the sacrifice of his revenge'  Mr Dennis in resentment of this representation made of him in his remarks on Pope's Homer page thus mentions him  'There is a notorious idiot one HIGHT WHACHUM who from an Underspurleather to the law is become an Under strapper to the playhouse who has lately burlesqued the Metamorphoses of Ovid by a vile translation c This fellow is concerned in an impertinent paper called the Censor'  Such was the language of Mr Dennis when enflamed by contradiction  In the year Mr Theobald introduced upon the stage a Tragedy called the Double Falsehood the greatest part of which he asserted was Shakespear's Mr Pope insinuated to the town that it was all or certainly the greatest part written not by Shakespear but Theobald himself and quotes this line  None but thyself can be thy parallel  Which he calls a marvellous line of Theobald  'unless says he the play called the Double Falsehood be as he would have it thought Shakespear's but whether this line is his or not he proves Shakespear to have written as bad'  The arguments which Mr Theobald uses to prove the play to be Shakespear's are indeed far from satisfactoryFirst that the MS was above sixty years oldSecondly that once Mr Betterton had it or he hath heard soThirdly that some body told him the author gave it to a bastard daughter of hisBut fourthly and above all that he has a great mind that every thing that is good in our tongue should be Shakespear's  This Double Falsehood was vindicated by Mr Theobald who was attacked again in the art of sinking in poetry Here Mr Theobald endeavours to prove false criticisms want of understanding Shakespear's manner and perverse cavelling in Mr Pope He justifies himself and the great dramatic poet and essays to prove the Tragedy in question to be in reality Shakespear's and not unwor  hy of him We cannot set this controversy in a clearer light than by transcribing a letter subjoined to the Double Falsehood  DEAR SIR  You desire to know why in the general attack which Mr Pope has lately made against writers  living and dead he has so often had a fling of satire at me I should be very willing to plead guilty to his indictment and think as meanly of myself as he can possibly do were his quarrel altogether upon a sair or unbiassed nature But he is angry at the man and as Juvenal says  Facit indignatio versum  He has been pleased to reflect on me in a few quotations from a play which I had lately the good fortune to usher into the world I am there concerned in reputation to enter upon my defence There are three passages in his Art of Sinking in Poetry which he endeavours to bring into disgrace from the Double Falsehood  One of these passages alledged by our critical examiner is of that stamp which is certain to include me in the class of profound writers The place so offensive for its cloudiness is  The obscureness of her birth  Cannot eclipse the lustre of her eyes  Which make her all one light  I must own I think there needs no great Oedipus to solve the difficulty of this passage Nothing has ever been more common than for lovers to compare their mistresses eyes to suns and stars And what does Henriquez say more here than this  'That though his mistress be obscure by her birth yet her eyes are so refulgent they set her above that disadvantage and make her all over brightness'  I remember another rapture in Shakespear upon a painter's drawing a fine lady's picture where the thought seems to me every whit as magnified and dark at the first glance  But her eyes  How could he see to do them having done one  Methinks it should have power to steal both his  And leave itself unfinished  This passage is taken from the Merchant of Venice which will appear the more beautiful the more it is considered  Another passage which Mr Pope is pleased to be merry with is in a speech of Violante's  Wax render up thy trust  This in his English is open the letter and he facetiously mingles it with some pompous instances most I believe of his own framing which in plain terms signify no more than See whose there snuff the candle uncork the bottle chip the bread to shew how ridiculous actions of no consequence are when too much exalted in the diction This he brings under a figure which he calls the Buskin or Stately But we'll examine circumstances fairly and then we shall see which is most ridiculous the phrase or our sagacious censurer  Violante is newly debauched by Henriquez on his solemn promise of marrying her She thinks he is returning to his father's court as he told her for a short time and expects no letter from him His servant who brings the letter contradicts his master's going for court and tells her he is gone some two months progress another way upon a change of purpose She who knew what concessions she had made to him declares herself by starts under the greatest agonies and immediately upon the servant leaving her expresses an equal impatience and fear of the contents of this unexpected letter  To hearts like mine suspence is misery  Wax render up thy trustBe the contents  Prosperous or fatal they are all my due  Now Mr Pope shews us his profound judgment in dramatical passions thinks a lady in her circumstances cannot without absurdity open a letter that seems to her as surprize with any more preparation than the most unconcerned person alive should a common letter by the pennypost I am aware Mr Pope may reply his cavil was not against the action itself of addressing to the wax but of exalting that action in the terms In this point I may fairly shelter myself under the judgment of a man whose character in poetry will vie with any rival this age shall produce  Mr Dryden in his Essay on Dramatic Poetry tells us  'That when from the most elevated thoughts of verse we pass to those which are most mean and which are common with the lowest houshold conversation yet still there is a choice to be made of the best words and the least vulgar provided they be apt to express such thoughts Our language says he is noble full and significant and I know not why he who is master of it may not cloath ordinary things in it as decently as the Latin if we use the same diligence in the choice of words'  I come now to the last quotation which in our examiner's handling falls under this predicament of  being a thought astonishingly out of the way of common sense  None but himself can be his parallel  This he hints may seem borrowed from the thought of that master of a show in Smithfield who wrote in large letters over the picture of his Elephant  This is the greatest Elephant in the world except himself  I like the pleasantry of the banter but have no great doubt of getting clear from the severity of it The lines in the play stand thus  Is there a treachery like this in baseness  Recorded any where It is the deepest  None but itself can be its parallel  I am not a little surprized to find that our exaaminer at last is dwindled into a wordcatcher Literally speaking indeed I agree with Mr Pope that nothing can be the parallel to itself but allowing a little for the liberty of expression does it not plainly imply that it is a treachery which stands single for the nature of its baseness and has not its parallel on record and that nothing but a treachery equal to it in baseness can parallel it If this were such nonsense as Pope would willingly have it it would be a very bad plea for me to alledge as the truth is that the line is in Shakespear's old copy for I might have suppressed it But I hope it is defensible at least if examples can keep it in countenance There is a piece of nonsense of the same kind in the Amphytrio of Plautus Sofia having survey'd Mercury from top to toe finds him such an exact resemblance of himself in dress shape and features that he cries out  Tam consimil' est at{que} ego  That is he is as like me as I am to myself Now I humbly conceive in strictness of expression a man can no more be like himself than a thing its own parallel But to confine myself to Shakespear I doubt not but I can produce some similar passages from him which literally examined are stark nonsense and yet taken with a candid latitude have never appeared ridiculous Mr Pope would scarce allow one man to say to another  'Compare and weigh your mistress with your mistress and I grant she is a very fair woman but compare her with some other woman that I could name and  the case will be very much altered'  Yet the very substance of this is said by Shakespear in Romeo and Juliet and Mr Pope has not degraded it as any absurdity or unworthy of the author  Pho pho you saw her fair none else being by  HERSELF poiz'd with HERSELF in either eye  But c  Or what shall we say of the three following quotations  ROMEO and JULIET  Oh so light a foot  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint  WINTER'S TALE  For  Cogitation  Resides not in the man  that does not think  HAMLET  Try what repentance can what can it not  Yet what can it when one  cannot repent  Who does not see at once the heaviest foot that ever trod cannot wear out the everlasting flint or that he who does not think has no thoughts in him or that repentance can avail nothing when a man has not repentance yet let these passages appear with a casting weight of allowance and their absurdity will not be so extravagant as when examined by the literal touchstone  Your's c LEWIS THEOBALD  By perusing the above the reader will be enabled to discern whether Mr Pope has wantonly ridiculed the passages in question or whether Mr Theobald  has from a superstitious zeal for the memory of Shakespear defended absurdities and palliated extravagant blunders  The ingenious Mr Dodd who has lately favoured the public with a judicious collection of the beauties of Shakespear has quoted a beautiful stroke of Mr Theobald's in his Double Falsehood upon music  Strike up my masters  But touch the strings with a religious softness  Teach sounds to languish thro' the night's dull ear  'Till Melancholy start from her lazy couch  And carelessness grow concert to attention  ACT I SCENE III  A gentleman of great judgment happening to commend these lines to Mr Theobald he assured him he wrote them himself and only them in the whole play  Mr Theobald besides his edition of all Shakespear's plays in which he corrected with great pains and ingenuity many faults which had crept into that great poet's writings is the author of the following dramatic pieces  I The Persian Princess or the Royal Villain a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane printed in the year The author observes in his preface this play was written and acted before he was full nineteen years old  II The Perfidious Brother a Tragedy acted at the Theatre in Little Lincoln'sInnFields This play is written on the model of Otway's Orphan the scene is in a private family in Brussels  III Pan and Syrinx an Opera of one act performed on the Theatre in Little Lincoln's InnFields  IV Decius and Paulina a Masque to which is added Musical Entertainments as performed at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields in the Dramatic Opera of Circe  V Electra a Tragedy translated from the Greek of Sophocles with notes printed in the year dedicated to Joseph Addison  Esq  VI Oedipus King of Thebes a Tragedy translated from Sophocles with notes translated in the year dedicated to the earl of Rockingham  VII Plutus or the World's Idol a Comedy translated from the Greek of Aristophanes with notes printed in the year The author has to this Translation prefixed a Discourse containing some Account of Aristophanes and his two Comedies of Plutus and the Clouds  VIII The Clouds a Comedy translated from Aristophanes with notes printed in the year  IX The Rape of Proserpine a Farce acted at the TheatreRoyal in Lincoln'sInnFields  X The Fatal Secret a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal in CoventGarden  XI The Vocal Parts of an Entertainment called Apollo and Daphne or the BurgoMaster Trick'd performed at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields  XII Double Falsehood which we have already mentioned  Mr Theobald's other Works are chiefly these  The Gentleman's Library containing Rules for Conduct in all Parts of Life in zmo  The first Book of Homer's Odyssey translated with notes vo  The Cave of Poverty written in imitation of Shakespear  Pindaric Ode on the Union  A Poem sacred to the Memory of Queen Anne Folio  Translations from Ovid's Metamorphoses  Lives of Antiochus and Berenice from the French  The Revd Dr SAMUEL CROXALL  THE celebrated author of the Fair Circassian was son of the revd Mr Samuel Croxall rector of Hanworth Middlesex and vicar of Walton upon Thames in Surry in the last of which places our author was born He received his early education at Eton school and from thence was admitted to St John's College Cambridge Probably while he was at the university he became enamoured of Mrs Anna Maria Mordaunt who first inspired his breast with love and to whom he dedicates the poem of the Circassian for which he has been so much distinguished This dedication is indeed the characteristic of a youth in love but then it likewise proves him altogether unacquainted with the world and with that easiness of address which distinguishes a gentleman A recluse scholar may be passionately in love but he discovers it by strains of bombast and forced allusions of which this dedication is a very lively instance  'The language of the Fair Circassian says he like yours was natural poetry her voice music and the excellent colouring and formation of her features painting but still like yours drawn by the inimitable pencil of nature life itself a pattern for the greatest master but copying after none I will not say angels are not cast in the same mould'  And again in another place  'Pardon O lovely deity the presumption  of this address and favour my weak endeavours If my confession of your divine power is any where too faint believe it not to proceed from a want of due respect but of a capacity more than human Whoever thinks of you can no longer be himself and if he could ought to be something above man to celebrate the accomplishment of a goddess To you I owe my creation as a lover and in the beams of your beauty only I live move and exist If there should be a suspension of your charms I should fall to nothing But it seems to be out of your power to deprive us of their kind influence wherever you shine they fill all our hearts and you are charming out of necessity as the author of nature is good'  We have quoted enough to shew the enthusiasm or rather phrenzy of this address which is written in such a manner as if it were intended for a burlesque on the False Sublime as the speeches of James I are upon pedantry  Mr Croxall who was intended for holy orders and probably when he published the Circassian had really entered into them was cautious lest he should be known to be the author of this piece since many divines have esteemed the Song of Solomon from which it is taken as an inspired poem emblematic of the Messiah and the Church Our author was of another opinion and with him almost all sensible men join in believing that it is no more than a beautiful poem composed by that Eastern monarch upon some favourite lady in his Seraglio He artfully introduces it with a preface in which he informs us that it was the composition of a young gentleman his pupil lately deceased executed by him while he was influenced by that violent passion with which Mrs Mordaunt inspired him He then endeavours to ascertain who this Eastern beauty was who had charms to enflame the heart of the royal poet He is of opinion it  could not be Pharaoh's daughter as has been commonly conjectured because the bride in the Canticles is characterised as a private person a shepherdess one that kept a vineyard and was ill used by her mother's children all which will agree very well with somebody else but cannot without great straining be drawn to sit the Egyptian Princess He then proceeds  'seeing we have so good reason to conclude that it was not Pharaoh's daughter we will next endeavour to shew who she was and here we are destitute of all manner of light but what is afforded us by that little Arabian manuscript mentioned in the Philosophical Transactions of Amsterdam said to be found in a marble chest among the ruins of Palmyra and presented to the university of Leyden by Dr Hermanus Hoffman The contents of which are something in the nature of Memoirs of the Court of Solomon giving a sufficient account of the chief offices and posts in his houshold of the several funds of the royal revenue of the distinct apartments of his palace there of the different Seraglios being fifty two in number in that one city Then there is an account given of the Sultanas their manner of treatment and living their birth and country with some touches of their personal endowments how long they continued in favour and what the result was of the King's fondness for each of them Among these there is particular mention made of a slave of more exceeding beauty than had ever been known before at whose appearance the charms of all the rest vanished like stars before the morning sun that the King cleaved to her with the strongest affection and was not seen out of the Seraglio where she was kept for about a month That she was taken captive together with her mother out of a vineyard on the Coast of Circassia  by a Corsair of Hiram King of Tyre and brought to Jerusalem It is said she was placed in the ninth Seraglio to the east of Palmyra which in the Hebrew tongue is called Tadmor which without further particulars are sufficient to convince us that this was the charming person sung with so much rapture by the Royal poet and in the recital of whose amour he seems so transported For she speaks of herself as one that kept a vineyard and her mother's introducing her in one of the gardens of pleasure as it seems she did at her first presenting her to the King is here distinctly mentioned The manuscript further takes notice that she was called Saphira from the heavenly blue of her eyes'  Notwithstanding the caution with which Mr Croxall published the Fair Circassian yet it was some years after known to be his The success it met with which was not indeed above its desert was perhaps too much for vanity of which authors are seldom entirely divested to resist and he might be betrayed into a confession from that powerful principle of what otherwise would have remained concealed  Some years after it was published Mr Cragg one of the ministers of the city of Edinburgh gave the world a small volume of spiritual poems in one of which he takes occasion to complain of the prostitution of genius and that few poets have ever turned their thoughts towards religious subjects and mentions the author of the Circassian with great indignation for having prostituted his Muse to the purposes of lewdness in converting the Song of Solomon a work as he thought it of sacred inspiration into an amorous dialogue between a King and his mistress His words are  Curss'd be he that the Circassian wrote  Perish his fame contempt be all his lot  Who basely durst in execrable strains  Turn holy mysteries into impious scenes  The revd gentleman met with some remonstrances from his friends for indulging so splenetic a temper when he was writing in the cause of religion as to wish any man accursed Of this censure he was not insensible in the next edition of his poems he softened the sarcasm by declaring in a note that he had no enmity to the author's person and that when he wished him accursed he meant not the man but the author which are two very distinct considerations for an author may be accursed that is damned to same while the man may be in as fair a way to happiness as any body but continues he I should not have expected such prophanation from a clergyman  The Circassian however is a beautiful poem the numbers are generally smooth and there is a tender delicacy in the dialogue though greatly inferior to the noble original  Mr Croxall had not long quitted the university e'er he was instituted to the living of Hampton in Middlesex and afterwards to the united parishes of St Mary Somerset and St Mary Mounthaw in the city of London both which he held 'till his death He was also chancellor prebend and canon residentiary and portionist of the church of Hereford Towards the latter end of the reign of Queen Anne he published two original Cantos in imitation of Spenser's Fairy Queen which were meant as a satire on the earl of Oxford's administration In the year he addressed a poem to the duke of Argyle upon his obtaining a Victory over the Rebels and the same year published The Vision a poem addressed to the earl of  Halifax He was concerned with many others in the translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses of which the following were performed by him  The Story of Nisus and Scylla from the sixth Book  The Labyrinth and Daedalus and Icarus from the eighth Book  Part of the Fable of Cyparissus from the tenth Book  Most part of the eleventh Book and The Funeral of Memnon from the thirteenth Book  He likewise performed an entire Translation of Aesop's Fables  Subjoined to the Fair Circassian are several Poems addressed to Sylvia Naked Truth from the second Book of Ovid's Fastorum Heathen Priestcraft from the first Book of Ovid's Fastorum A Midsummer's Wish and an Ode on Florinda seen while she was Bathing He is also author of a curious work in one Volume Octavo entitled Scripture Politics being a view of the original constitution and subsequent revolutions in the government of that people out of whom the Saviour of the World was to arise As it is contained in the Bible  In consequence of his strong attachment to the Whig interest he was made archdeacon of Salop and chaplain in ordinary to his present Majesty  As late as the year Dr Croxall published a poem called The Royal Manual in the preface to which he endeavours to shew that it was composed by Mr Andrew Marvel and found amongst his MSS but the proprietor declares that it was written by Dr Croxall himself This was the last of his performances for he died the year following in a pretty advanced age His abilities as a poet we cannot better display than by the specimen we are about to quote  On FLORINDA Seen while she was Bathing  'TWAS summer and the clear resplendent moon  Shedding far o'er the plains her fullorb'd light  Among the lesser stars distinctly shone  Despoiling of its gloom the scanty night  When walking forth a lonely path I took  Nigh the fair border of a purling brook  Sweet and resreshing was the midnight air  Whose gentle motions hush'd the silent grove  Silent unless when prick'd with wakeful care  Philomel warbled out her tale of love  While blooming flowers which in the meadow grew  O'er all the place their blended odours threw  Just by the limpid river's crystal wave  Its eddies gilt with Phoebe's silver ray  Still as it flow'd a glittering lustre gave  With glancing gleams that emulate the day  Yet oh not half so bright as those that rise  Where young Florinda bends her smiling eyes  Whatever pleasing views my senses meet  Her intermingled charms improve the theme  The warbling birds the flow'rs that breath so sweet  And the soft surface of the dimpled stream  Resembling in the nymph some lovely part  With pleasures more exalted seize my heart  Rapt in these thoughts I negligently rov'd  Imagin'd transports all my soul employ  When the delightful voice of her I lov'd  Sent thro' the Shades a sound of real joy  Confus'd it came with giggling laughter mixt  And echo from the banks reply'd betwixt  Inspir'd with hope upborn with light desire  To the dear place my ready footsteps tend  Quick as when kindling trails of active fire  Up to their native firmament ascend  There shrouded in the briers unseen I stood  And thro' the leaves survey'd the neighb'ring stood  Florinda with two sister nymphs undrest  Within the channel of the cooly tide  By bathing sought to sooth her virgin breast  Nor could the night her dazzling beauties hide  Her seatures glowing with eternal bloom  Darted like Hesper thro' the dusky gloom  Her hair bound backward in a spiral wreath  Her upper beauties to my sight betray'd  The happy stream concealing those beneath  Around her waste with circling waters play'd  Who while the fair one on his bosom sported  Her dainty limbs with liquid kisses courted  A thousand Cupids with their infant arms  Swam padling in the current here and there  Some with smiles innocent remark'd the charms  Of the regardless undesigning fair  Some with their little Eben bows fullbended  And levell'd shafts the naked girl desended  Her eyes her lips her breasts exactly round  Of lilly hue unnumber'd arrows sent  Which to my heart an casy passage sound  Thrill'd in my bones and thro' mymarrow went  Some bubb  ing upward thro' the water came  Prepar'd by fancy to augment my siame  Ah love how ill I bore thy pleasing pain  For while the tempting scene so near I view'd  A fierce impatience throb'd in every vein  Discretion fled and reason lay subdu'd  My blood beat high and with its trembling made  A strange commotion in the rustling shade  Fear seiz'd the tim'rous Naiads all aghast  Their boding spirits at the omen sink  Their eyes they wildly on each other cast  And meditate to gain the farther brink  When in I plung'd resolving to asswage  In the cool gulph love's importuning rage  Ah stay Florinda so I meant to speak  Let not from love the loveliest object fly  But ere I spoke a loud combining squeak  From shrilling voices pier  'd the distant sky  When straight as each was their peculiar care  Th' immortal pow'rs to bring relief prepare  A golden cloud descended from above  Like that which whilom hung on Ida's brow  Where Juno Pallas and the queen of love  As then to Paris were conspicuous now  Each goddess seiz'd her fav  rite charge and threw  Around her limbs a robe of azure hue  But Venus who with pity saw my flame  Kindled by her own Amoret so bright  Approv'd in private what she seem'd to blame  And bless'd me with a vision of delight  Careless she dropt Florinda's veil aside  That nothing might her choicest beauties hide  I saw Elysium and the milky way  Fairopening to the shades beneath her breast  In Venus' lap the struggling wanton lay  And while she strove to hide reveal'd the rest  A mole embrown'd with no unseemly grace  Grew near embellishing the sacred place  So pleas'd I view'd as one fatigu'd with heat  Who near at hand beholds a shady bower  Joyful in hope amidst the kind retreat  To shun the daystar in his noontide hour  Or as when parch'd with droughty thirst he spies  A mossy grot whence purest waters rise  So I Florindabut beheld in vain  Like Tantalus who in the realms below  Sees blushing fruits which to increase his pain  When he attempts to eat his taste forego  O Venus give me more or let me drink  Of Lethe's fountain and forget to think  The Revd Mr CHRISTOPHER PITT  THE celebrated translater of Virgil was born in the year He received his ea  ly education in the college near Winchester and in was removed from thence to new college in Oxford When he had studied there four years he was preferred to the living of Pimperne in Dorsetshire by his friend and relation Mr George Pitt which he held during the remaining part of his life While he was at the university he possessed the affection and esteem of all who knew him and was particularly distinguished by that great poet Dr Young who so much admired the early displ  s of his genius that with an engaging familiarity he used to call him his son  Amongst the first of Mr Pitt's performances which saw the light were a panegyrie on lord Stanhope and a poem on the Plague of Marseilles But he had two large Folio's of MS Poems very fairly written ou  while he was a schoolboy which at the time of election were delivered to the examiners One of these volumes contained an entire translation of Lucan and the other consisted of Miscellaneous pieces Mr Pitt's Lucan has never been published perhaps from the consideration of its being the production of his early life or from a consciousness of its not equalling the translation of that author by Rowe who executed this task in the meridian of his genius Several of his other pieces were published afterwards in his volume of Miscellaneous Poems  The ingenious writer of the Student hath obliged the world by inserting in that work several original pieces by Mr Pitt whose name is prefixed to them  Next to his beautiful Translation of Virgil Mr Pitt gained the greatest reputation by rendering into English Vida's Art of Poetry which he has executed with the strictest attention to the author's sense with the utmost elegance of versification and without suffering the noble spirit of the original to be lost in his translation  This amiable poet died in the year without leaving one enemy behind him On his tombstone were engraved these words  " He lived innocent and died beloved"  Mr Auditor Benson who in a pamphlet of his writing has treated Dryden's translation of Virgil with great contempt was yet charmed with that by Mr Pitt and found in it some beauties of which he was fond even to a degree of enthusiasim Alliteration is one of those beauties Mr Benson so much admired and in praise of which he has a long dissertation in his letters on translated verse He once took an opportunity in conversation with Mr Pitt to magnify that beauty and to compliment him upon it Mr Pitt thought this article far less considerable than Mr Benson did but says he  'since you are so fond of alliteration the following couplet upon Cardinal Woolsey will not displease you  ' Begot by butchers but by bishops bred  ' How high his honour holds his haughty head  Benson was no doubt charmed to hear his favourite grace in poetry so beautifully exemplified which it certainly is without any affectation or stiffness  Waller thought this a beauty and Dryden was very fond of it Some late writers under the notion of imitating these two great versifiers in this point run into downright affectation and are g  ilty of the most improper and ridiculous expressions p  ovided there be but an alliteration It is very remarkable that an affectation of this beauty is ridiculed by Shakespear in Love's Labour Lost Act II where the Pedant Holofernes says  I will something affect the letter for it argues facility  The praiseful princess pierced and prickt  Mr Upton in his letter concerning Spencer observes that alliteration is ridiculed too in Chaucer in a passage which every reader does not understand  The Ploughman's Tale is written in some measure in imitation of Pierce's Ploughman's Visions and runs chiefly upon some one letter or at least many stanza's have this affected iteration as  A full sterne striefe is stirr'd now  For some be grete grown on grounde  When the Parson therefore in his order comes to tell his tale which reflected on the clergy he says  I am a southern man  I cannot jest rum ram ruff by letter  And God wote rime hold I but little better  Ever since the publication of Mr Pitt's version of the Aeneid the learned world has been divided concerning the just proportion of merit which ought  to be ascribed to it Some have made no scruple in defiance of the authority of a name to prefer it to Dryden's both in exactness as to his author's sense and even in the charms of poetry This perhaps will be best discovered by producing a few shining passages of the Aeneid translated by these two great masters  In biographical writing the first and most essential principal is candour which no reverence for the m  mory of the dead nor affection for the virtues of the living should violate The impartiality which we have endeavoured to observe through this work obliges us to declare that so far as our judgment may be trusted the latter poet has done most justice to Virgil that he shines in Pitt with a lustre which Dryden wanted not power but leisure to bestow and a reader from Pitt's version will both acquire a more intimate knowledge of Virgil's meaning and a more exalted idea of his abilitiesLet not this detract from the high representations we have endeavoured in some other places to make of Dryden When he undertook Virgil he was stooping with age oppressed with wants and conflicting with infirmities In this situation it was no wonder that much of his vigour was lost and we ought rather to admire the amazing force of genius which was so little depressed under all these calamities than industriously to dwell on his imperfections  Mr Spence in one of his chapters on Allegory in his Polymetis has endeavoured to shew how very little our poets have understood the allegories of the antients even in their translations of them and has instanced Mr Dryden's translation of the Aeneid as he thought him one of our most celebrated poets The mistakes are very numerous and some of them unaccountably gross Upon this  says Mr Warton  "I was desirous to examine Mr Pitt's translation of the same passages and was surprized to find near fifty instances which Mr Spence has given of Dryden's mistakes of that kind when Mr Pitt had not sallen into above three or four"  Mr Warton then produces some instances which we shall not here transcribe as it will be more entertaining to our readers to have a few of the most shining passages compared in which there is the highest room for rising to a blaze of poetry  There are few strokes in the whole Aeneid which have been more admired than Virgil's description of the Lake of Avernus Book VI  Spelunca alta suit vastoque immanis hiatu  Scrupea tuta lacu nigro nemorumque tenebris  Quam super haud ullae poterant impune volantes  Tendere iter pennis talis sese halitus atris  Faucibus effundens supera ad convexa ferebat  Unde locum Graii dixerunt nomine Aornon  Quatuor hic primum nigrantes terga juvencos  Constituit frontique invergit vina sacerdos  Et summas carpens media inter cornua setas  Igmbus imponit sacris libamina prima  Voce vocans Hecaten caeloque ereboque potentem  DRYDEN  Deep was the cave and downward as it went  From the wide mouth a rocky wide descent  And here th' access a gloomy grove defends  And there th' innavigable lake extends  O'er whose unhappy waters void of light  No bird presumes to steer his airy flight  Such deadly stenches from the depth arise  And steaming sulphur that infects the skies  From hence the Grecian bards their legends snake  And give the name Aornus to the lake  Four sable bullocks in the yoke untaught  For sacrifice the pious hero brought  The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns  Then euts the curling hair that first oblation burns  Invoking Hecate hither to repair  A powerful name in hell and upper air  PITT  Deep deep a cavern lies devoid of light  All rough with rocks and horrible to sight  Its dreadful mouth is fenc'd with sable floods  And the brown horrors of surrounding woods  From its black jaws such baleful vapours rise  Blot the bright day and blast the golden skies  That not a bird can stretch her pinions there  Thro' the thick poisons and incumber'd air  But struck by death her flagging pinions cease  And hence Aornus was it call'd by Greece  Hither the priestess four black heifers led  Between their horns the hallow'd  ine she shed  From their high front the topmost hairs she drew  And in the flames the first oblations threw  Then calls on potent Hecate renown'd  In Heav'n above and Erebus profound  The next instance we shall produce in which as in the former Mr Pitt has greatly exceeded Dryden is taken from Virgil's description of Elysium which says Dr Trap is so charming that it is almost Elysium to read it  His demum exactis perfecto munere divae  Devenere locos laetos amoena vireta  Fortunatorum nemorum sedesque beatas  Largior hic campos aether lumine vestit  Purpureo solemque suum sua fidera norunt  Pars in gramineis exercent membra palaestris  Contendunt ludo fulva luctantur arena  Pars pedibus plaudunt choreas carmina dicunt  Necnon Threicius longa cum veste sacerdos  Obloquitur numeris septem discrimina vocum  Jamque eadem digitis jam pectine pulsat eburno  PITT  These rites compleat they reach the flow'ry plains  The verdant groves where endless pleasure reigns  Here glowing Aether shoots a purple ray  And o'er the region pours a double day  From sky to sky th' unwearied splendour runs  And nobler planets roll round brighter suns  Some wrestle on the sands and some in play  And games heroic pass the hours away  Those raise the song divine and these advance  In measur'd steps to form the solemn dance  There Orpheus graceful in his long attire  In seven divisions strikes the sounding lyre  Across the chords the quivering quill he fiings  Or with his flying fingers sweeps the strings  DRYDEN  These holy rites perform'd they took their way  Where long extended plains of pleasure lay  The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie  With Aether vested and a purple sky  The blissful seats of happy souls below  Stars of their own and their own suns they know  Their airy limbs in sports they exercise  And on the green contend the wrestlers prize  Some in heroic verse divinely sing  Others in artful measures lead the ring  The Thracian bard surrounded by the rest  There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest  His flying fingers and harmonious quill  Strike seven distinguish'd notes and seven at once they fill  In the celebrated description of the swiftness of Camilla in the VIIth Aeneid which Virgil has laboured with so much industry Dryden is more equal to Pitt than in the foregoing instances tho' we think even in this he falls short of him  Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret  Gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas  Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti  Ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas  DRYDEN  The fierce virago fought  Outstrip'd the winds in speed upon the plain  Flew o'er the fields nor hurt the bearded grain  She swept the seas and as she skim'd along  Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung  PITT  She led the rapid race and left behind  The flagging floods and pinions of the wind  Lightly she flies along the level plain  Nor hurts the tender grass nor bends the golden grain  Or o'er the swelling surge suspended sweeps  And smoothly skims unbath'd along the deeps  We shall produce one passage of a very different kind from the former that the reader may have the pleasure of making the comparison This is the celebrated simile in the XIth Book when the siery eagerness of Turnus panting for the battle is resembled to that of a Steed which is perhaps one of the most picturesque beauties in the whole Aeneid  Qualis ubi abruptis sugit praesepia vinc'lis  Tandem liber equus campoque potitus aperto  Aut  le in pastus armentaque tendit equarum  Aut assuetus aquae perfundi flumine noto  Emicat arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte  Luxurians luduntque jubae per colla per armos  DRYDEN  Freed from his keepers thus with broken reins  The wanton courser prances o'er the plains  Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds  And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds  Or seeks his wat'ring in the wellknown flood  To quench his thirst and cool his fiery blood  He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain  And o'er his shoulders flows his waving main  He neighs he snorts he bears his head on high  Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly  PITT  So the gay pamper'd steed with loosen'd reins  Breaks from the stall and pours along the plains  With large smooth strokes he rushes to the slood  Bathes his bright sides and cools his fiery blood  Neighs as he flies and tossing high his head  Snuffs the fair females in the distant mead  At every motion o'er his neck reclin'd  Plays his redandaut main and dances in the wind  From the above specimens our readers may determine for themselves to whose translation they would give the preference Critics like historians should divest themselves of prejudice they should never be misguided by the authority of a great name nor yield that tribute to prescription which is only due to merit Mr Pitt no doubt had many advantages above Dryden in this arduous province As he was later in the attempt he had consequently the version of Dryden to improve upon He saw the errors of that great poet and avoided them he discovered his beauties and improved upon them and as he was not impelled by necessity he had leisure to revise correct and finish his excellent work  The Revd and ingenious Mr Joseph Warton has given to the world a compleat edition of Virgil's works made English The Aeneid by Mr Pitt The Eclogues Georgics and notes on the whole by himself with some new observations by Mr Holdsworth Mr Spence and others This is the compleatest English dress in which Virgil ever appeared It is enriched with a dissertation on the VIth Book of the Aeneid by Warburton On the Shield of Aeneas by Mr William Whitehead On the Character of Japis by the late Dr Atterbury bishop of Rochester and three Essays on Pastoral Didactic and Epic Poetry by Mr Warton  Mr HAMMOND  THIS Gentleman known to the world by the Love Elegies which some years after his death were published by the Earl of Chesterfield was the son of a Turkey merchant in the city of  London We cannot ascertain where he received his education but it does not appear that he was at any of the universities Mr Hammond was early preferred to a place about the person of the late Prince of Wales which he held till an unfortunate accident stript him of his reason or at least so affected his imagination that his senses were greatly disordered The unhappy cause of his calamity was a passion he entertained for one Miss Dashwood which proved unsuccessful Upon this occasion it was that he wrote his Love Elegies which have been much celebrated for their tenderness The lady either could not return his passion with a recip  ocal fondness or entertained too ambitious views to settle her affections upon him which he himself in some of his Elegies seems to hint for he frequently mentions her passion for gold and splendour and justly treats it as very unworthy a fair one's bosom The chief beauty of these Elegies certainly consists in their being written by a man who intimately felt the subject for they are more the language of the heart than of the head They have warmth but little poetry and Mr Hammond seems to have been one of those poets who are made so by love not by nature  Mr Hammond died in the year in the thirtyfirst year of his age at Stow the seat of his kind patron the lord Cobham who honoured him with a particular intimacy The editor of Mr Hammond's Elegies observes that he composed them before he was years of age a period says he when fancy and imagination commonly riot at the expence of judgment and correctness He was sincere in his love as in his friendship he wrote to his mistress as he spoke to his friends nothing but the true genuine sentiments of his heart Tibullus seems to have been the model our author judiciously preferred to Ovid  the former writing directly from the heart to the heart the latter too often yielding and addressing himself to the imagination  As a specimen of Mr Hammond's turn for Elegiac Poetry we shall quote his third Elegy in which he upbraids and threatens the avarice of Neaera and resolves to quit her  Should Jove descend in floods of liquid ore  And golden torrents stream from every part  That craving bosom still would heave for more  Not all the Gods cou'd satisfy thy heart  But may thy folly which can thus disdain  My honest love the mighty wrong repay  May midnightfire involve thy sordid gain  And on the shining heaps of rapine prey  May all the youths like me by love deceiv'd  Not quench the ruin but applaud the doom  And when thou dy'st may not one heart be griev'd  May not one tear bedew the lonely tomb  But the deserving tender gen'rous maid  Whose only care is her poor lover's mind  Tho' ruthless age may bid her beauty fade  In every friend to love a friend shall find  And when the lamp of life will burn no more  When dead she seems as in a gentle sleep  The pitying neighbour shall her loss deplore  And round the bier assembled lovers weep  With flow'ry garlands each revolving year  Shall strow the grave where truth and softness rest  Then home returning drop the pious tear  And bid the turff lie easy on her breast  Mr JOHN BANKS  THIS poet was the son of Mr John Banks of Sunning in Berkshire in which place he was born in His father dying while our author was very young the care of his education devolved upon an uncle in law who placed him at a private school under the tuition of one Mr Belpene an Anabaptist This schoolmaster so far from encouraging young Banks to make a great progress in classical learning exerted his influence with his relations to have him taken from school and represented him as incapable of receiving much erudition This conduct in Mr Belpene proceeded from an early jealousy imbibed against this young man who so far from being dull as the schoolmaster represented him possessed extraordinary parts of which he gave very early proofs  Mr Belpene was perhaps afraid that as soon as Mr Banks should finish his education he would be preferred to him as minister to the congregation of Anabaptists which place he enjoyed independent of his school The remonstrances of Mr Belpene prevailed with Mr Banks's uncle who took him from school and put him apprentice to a Weaver at Reading Before the expiration of the apprenticeship Mr Banks had the misfortune to break his arm and by that accident was disqualified from pursuing the employment to which he was bred How early Mr Banks began to write we cannot determine but probably the first sallies of his wit were directed against this schoolmaster  by whom he was injuriously treated and by whose unwarrantable jealousy his education in some measure was ruined Our author by the accident already mentioned being rendered unfit to obtain a livelihood by any mechanical employment was in a situation deplorable enough His uncle was either unable or unwilling to assist him or perhaps as the relation between them was only collateral he had not a sufficient degree of tenderness for him to make any efforts in his favour In this perplexity of our young poet's affairs ten pounds were left him by a relation which he very oeconomically improved to the best advantage He came to London and purchasing a parcel of old books he set up a stall in SpitalFields  Much about this time Stephen Duck who had wrote a poem called The Thresher reaped very great advantages from it and was caressed by persons in power who in imitation of the Royal patroness heaped favours upon him perhaps more on account of the extraordinary regard Queen Caroline had shewn him than any opinion of his merit Mr Banks considered that the success of Mr Duck was certainly owing to the peculiarity of his circumstances and that the novelty of a thresher writing verses was the genuine cause of his being taken notice of and not any intrinsic excellence in the verses themselves This reflexion inspired him with a resolution of making an effort of the same kind but as curiosrty was no more to be excited by novelty the attempt was without success He wrote in imitation of The Thresher The Weaver's Miscellany which failed producing the intended effect and 'tis said never was reckoned by Mr Banks himself as any way worthy of particular distinction His business of selling books upon a stall becoming disagreeable to him as it demanded a constant and uncomfortable attendance he quitted that way of life  and was received into the shop of one Mr Montague a bookbinder and bookseller whom he served some time as a journeyman During the time he lived with Mr Montague he employed his leisure hours in composing several poems which were now swelled to such a number that he might sollicit a subscription for them with a good grace He had taken care to improve his acquaintance and as he had a power of distinguishing his company he found his interest higher in the world than he had imagined He addressed a poem to Mr Pope which he transmitted to that gentleman with a copy of his proposals inclosed Mr Pope answered his letter and the civilities contained in it by subscribing for two setts of his poems and 'tis said he wrote to Mr Banks the following compliment  ' May this put money in your purse  ' For friend believe me I've seen worse'  The publication of these poems while they no doubt enhanced his interest added likewise something to his reputation and quitting his employment at Mr Montague's he made an effort to live by writing only He engaged in a large work in folio entitled The Life of Christ which was very acceptable to the public and was executed with much piety and precision  Mr Banks's next prose work of any considerable length was A Critical Review of the Life of Oliver Cromwell We have already taken notice that he received his education among the Anabaptists and consequently was attached to those principles and a favourer of that kind of constitution which Cromwell in the first period of his power meant to establish Of the many Lives of this great man with which the biography of this nation has been augmented perhaps not one is written with a true dispassionate candour Men are divided in their sentiments concerning the measures which at that critical Aera  were pursued by contending factions The writers who have undertaken to review those unhappy times have rather struggled to defend a party to which they may have been swayed by education or interest than by stripping themselves of all partiality to dive to the bottom of contentions in search of truth The heats of the Civil War produced such animosities that the fervour which then prevailed communicated itself to p  sterity and though at the distance of a hundred years has not yet subsided It will be no wonder then if Mr Banks's Review is not sound altogether impartial He has in many cases very successfully defended Cromwell he has yielded his conduct in others to the just censure of the world But were a Whig and a Tory to read this book the former would pronounce him a champion for liberty and the latter would declare him a subverter of truth an enemy to monarchy and a friend to that chaos which Oliver in  roduced  Mr Banks by his early principles was no doubt biassed to the Whig interest and perhaps it may be true that in tracing the actions of Cromwell he may have dwelt with a kind of increasing pleasure on the bright side of his character and but slightly hinted at those facts on which the other party fasten when they mean to traduce him as a pa  ricide and an usurper But supposing the allegation to be true Mr Banks in this particular has only discovered the common failing of humanity prejudice and partiality being blemishes from which the mind of man perhaps can never be entirely purged  Towards the latter end of Mr Banks's life he was employed in writing two weekly newspapers the Old England and the Westminster Journals Those papers treated chiefly on the politics of the times and the trade and navigation of England They were carried on by our author without offence  to any party with an honest regard to the public interest and in the same kind of spirit that works of that sort generally are These papers are yet continued by other hands  Mr Banks had from nature very considerable abilities and his poems deservedly hold the second rank They are printed in two volumes vo Besides the poems contained in these volumes there are several other poetical pieces of his scattered in newspapers and other periodical works to which he was an occasional contributer He had the talent of relating a tale humorously in verse and his graver poems have both sorce of thinking and elegance of numbers to recommend them  Towards the spring of the year Mr Banks who had long been in a very indifferent state of health visibly declined His disorder was of a nervous sort which he bore with great patience and even with a chearful resignation This spring proved fatal to him he died on the th of April at his house at Islington where he had lived several years in easy circumstances by the produce of his pen without leaving one enemy behind him  Mr Banks was a man of real good nature of an easy benevolent disposition and his friends e  er esteemed him as a most agreeable companion He had none of the petulance which too frequentl renders men of genius unacceptable to their acquaintance He was of so composed a temper that he was seldom known to be in a passion and he wore a perpetual chearfulness in his countenance He was rather bashful than forward his address did not qualify him for gay company and though he poss  ssed a very extensive knowledge of things yet as he had not  much grace of delivery or elegance of manner he could not make so good a figure in conversation as many persons of less knowledge with a happier appearance Of all authors Mr Banks was the farthest removed from envy or malevolence As he could not bear the least whisper of detraction so he was never heard to express uneasiness at the growing reputation of another nor was he ever engaged in literary contests We shall conclude this article in the words of lord Clarendon  'He that lives such a life need be less anxious at how short warning it is taken from him  See lord Clarendon's character of the lord Falkland  '  Mrs LAETITIA PILKINGTON  THIS unfortunate poetess the circumstances of whose life written by herself have lately entertained the public was born in the year She was the daughter of Dr Van I ewen a gentleman of Dutch extraction who settled in Dublin Her mother was descended of an ancient and honourable family who have frequently intermarried with the nobility  Mrs Pilkington from her earliest infancy had a st ong disposition to letters and particularly to poetry All her leisure hours were dedicated to the muses from a reader she quickly became a writer and as Mr Pope expresses it  ' She lisp'd in numbers for the numbers came'  Her performances were considered as extraordinary for her years and drew upon her the admiration  of many who found more pleasure in her conversation than that of girls generally affords In consequence of a poetical genius and an engaging sprightliness peculiar to her she had many wooers some of whom seriously addressed her while others meant no more than the common gallantries of young people After the usual ceremony of a courtship she became the wife of Mr Matthew Pilkington a gentleman in holy orders and well known in the poetical world by his volume of Miscellanies revised by dean Swift As we have few materials for Mrs Pilkington's life beside those furnished by herself in her Memoirs published in our readers must depend upon her veracity for some facts which we may be obliged to mention upon her sole authority  Our poetess says she had not been long married e'er Mr Pilkington became jealous not of her person but her understanding She was applauded by dean Swift and many other persons of taste every compliment that was paid her gave a mortal stab to his peace Behold the difference between the lover and the husband When Mr Pilkington courted her he was not more enamoured of her person than her poetry he shewed her verses to every body in the enthusiasm of admiration but now he was become a husband it was a kind of treason for a wife to pretend to literary accomplishments  It is certainly true that when a woman happens to have more understanding than her husband she should be very industrious to conceal it but it is likewise true that the natural vanity of the sex is difficult to check and the vanity of a poet still more difficult wit in a female mind can no more cease to sparkle than she who possesses it can cease to speak Mr Pilkington began to view her with scornful yet with jealous eyes and in this situation nothing but mis  ry was likely to be their lot While these jealousies subsisted Mr Pilkington  contrary to the advice of his friends went into England in order to serve as chaplain to alderman Barber during his mayoralty of the city of London  While he remained in London and having the strange humour of loving his wife best at a distance he wrote her a very kind letter in which he informed her that her verses were like herself full of elegance and beauty  An extravagant compliment for Mrs Pilkington was far from being a beauty  that Mr Pope and others to whom he had shewn them longed to see the writer and that he heartily wished her in London This letter set her heart on flame London has very attractive charms to most young people and it cannot be much wondered at if Mrs Pilkington should take the only opportunity she was ever likely to have of gratifying her curiosity which however proved fatal to her for though we cannot find that during this visit to London her conduct was the least reproachable yet upon her return to Ireland she underwent a violent persecution of tongues They who envied her abilities fastened now upon her morals they were industrious to trace the motives of her going to London her behaviour while she was there and insinuated suspicions against her chastity These detracters were chiefly of her own sex who supplied by the bitterest malice what they wanted in power  Not long after this an accident happened which threw Mrs Pilkington's aff  irs into the utmost confusion Her father was stabbed as she has related by an accident but many people in Dublin believe by his own wife though some say by his own hand Upon this melancholy occasion Mrs Pilkington has given an account of her father which places her in a very amiable light She discovered for him the most filial tenderness she watched  ound his bed and seems to have been the only relation then about him who  deserved his blessing From the death of her father her sufferings begin and the subsequent part of her life is a continued series of misfortunes  Mr Pilkington having now no expectation of a fortune by her threw off all reserve in his behaviour to her While Mrs Pilkington was in the country for her health his dislike of her seems to have encreased and perhaps he resolved to get rid of his wife at any rate nor was he long waiting for an occasion of parting with her The story of their separation may be found at large in her Memoirs The substance is that she was so indiscreet as to permit a gentleman to be found in her bedchamber at an unseasonable hour for which she makes this apology  'Lovers of learning I am sure will pardon me as I solemnly declare it was the attractive charms of a new book which the gentleman would not lend me but consented to stay till I read it through that was the sole motive of my detaining him'  This indeed is a poor evasion and as Mrs Pilkington has said no more in favour of her innocence they must have great charity indeed with whom she can stand exculpated  While the gentleman was with her the servants let in twelve men at the kitchen window who though they might as she avers have opened the chamber door chose rather to break it to pieces and took both her and the gentleman prisoners Her husband now told her that she must turn out of doors and taking hold of her hand made a present of it to the gentleman who could not in honour refuse to take her especially as his own liberty was to be procured upon no other terms It being then two o'clock in the morning and not knowing where to steer she went home with her gallant but she sincerely assures us that neither of them entertained a thought of any thing like love but sat like statues 'till break of day  The gentleman who was found with her was obliged to fly leaving a letter and five guineas inclosed in it for her She then took a lodging in some obscure street where she was persecuted by infamous women who were panders to men of fortune  In the mean time Mr Pilkington carried on a vigorous prosecution against her in the Spiritual Court during which as she says he solemnly declared he would allow her a maintainance if she never gave him any opposition but no sooner had he obtained a s  paration than he retracted every word he had said on that subject Upon this she was advised to lodge an appeal and as every one whom he consulted assured him he would be cast he made a proposal of giving her a small annuity and thirty pounds  Of which she says she received only  d  in money which in regard to her children she chose to accept rather than ruin their father She was with child at the time of her separatior and when her labour came on the woman where she lodged insisted upon doubling her rent whereupon she was obliged to write petitionary letters which were not always successful  Having passed the pains and peril of childbirth she begged of Mr Pilkington to send her some money to carry her to England who in hopes of getting rid of her sent her nine pounds She was the more desirous to leave Ireland as she found her character sinking every day with the public When she was on board the yacht a gentleman of figure in the gay world took an opportunity of making love to her which she rejected with some indignation  'Had I said she accepted the offers he made me poverty had never approached me I dined with him at Parkgate and I hope virtue will be rewarded for though I had but five guineas in the world to carry  me to London I yet possessed chastity enough to refase fifty for a night's lodging and that too from a handsome wellbred man I shall scarcely ever forget his words to me as they seemed almost prophetic'  "Well madam said he you do not know London you will be undone there"  "Why sir said I I hope you don't imagine I will go into a bad course of life"  "No madam said he but I think you will sit in your chamber and starve"  which upon my word I have been pretty near doing and but that the Almighty raised me one worthy friend good old Mr Cibber to whose humanity I am indebted under God both for liberty and life I had been quite lost'  When Mrs Pilkington arrived in London her conduct was the reverse of what prudence would have dictated She wanted to get into favour with the great and for that purpose took a lodging in St James's street at a guinea a week upon no other prospect of living than what might arise from some poems she intended to publish by subscription In this place she attracted the notice of the company frequenting White's ChocolateHouse and her story by means of Mr Cibber was made known to persons of the first distinction who upon his recommendation were kind to her  Her acquaintance with Mr Cibber began by a present she made him of The Trial of Constancy a poem of hers which Mr D  dsley published Mr Cibber upon this visited her and ever after with the most unwearied zeal promoted her interest The reader cannot expect that we should swell this volume by a minute relation of all the incidents which happened to her while she continued a poetical mendicant She has not without pride related all the little tattle which passed between her and persons of distinction who  through the abundance of their idleness thought proper to trifle an hour with her  Her virtue seems now to have been in a declining state at least her behaviour was such that a man must have extraordinary faith who can think her innocent She has told us in the second volume of her Memoirs that she received from a noble person a present of fifty pounds This she says was the ordeal or fiery trial youth beauty nobility of birth attacking at once the most desolate person in the world However we find her soon after this thrown into great distress and making various applications to persons of distinction for subscriptions to her poems Such as favoured her by subscribing she had repaid with most lavish encomiums and those that withheld that proof of their bounty she has sacrificed o  her resentment by exhibiting them in the most hideous light her imagination could form  From the general account of her characters this observation results That such as she has stigmatized for want of charity ought rather to be censured for want of decency There might be many reasons why a person benevolent in his nature might yet refuse to subseribe to her but in general such as refused did it as she says in a rude manner and she was more piqued at their deficiency in complaisance to her than their want of generosity Complaisance is easily shewn it may be done without expence it often procures admirers and can never make an enemy On the other hand benevolence itself accompanied with a bad grace may lay us under obligations but can never command our affection It is said of King Charles I that he bestowed his bounty with so bad a grace that he disobliged more by giving than his son by refusing and we have heard of a gentleman of great parts who went to Newgate with a greater satisfaction as the judge who committed him accompanied the  sentence with an apology and a compliment than he received from his releasment by another who in extending the King's mercy to him allayed the Royal clemency by severe invectives against the gentleman's conduct  We must avoid entering into a detail of the many addresses disappointments and encouragements which she met with in her attendance upon the great her characters are naturally sometimes justly and often strikingly exhibited The incidents of her life while she remained in London were not very important though she has related them with all the advantage they can admit of They are such as commonly happen to poets in distress though it does not often fall out that the insolence of wealth meets with such a bold return as this lady has given it There is a spirit of keenness and freedom runs through her book she spares no man because he is great by his station or famous by his abilities Some knowledge of the world may be gained from reading her Memoirs the d  fferent humours of mankind she has shewn to the life and whatever was ridiculous in the characters she met with is exposed in very lively terms  The next scene which opens in Mrs Pilkington's l  fe is the  rison of the Marshalsea The horrors and misenes of this jail she has pathetically described in such a manner as should affect the heart  f every rigid creditor In favour of her sellowprisoners she wrote a very moving memorial which we are told excited the legislative power to grant an Act of Grace for them After our poetess had remained nine weeks in this prison the was at last released by the goodness of Mr Cibber from whose representation of her distress no less than sixteen dukes contributed a guinea apiece towards her enlargement When this news was brought her she fainted away with excess of joy Some time after she had tasted liberty  she began to be weary of that continued attendance upon the great and therefore was resolved if ever she was again favoured with a competent sum to turn it into trade and quit the precarious life of a poetical mendicant Mr Cibber had five guineas in reserve for her which with ten more she received from the duke of Marlborough enabled her to take a shop in St James's Street which she filled with pamphlets and prints as being a business better suited to her taste and abilities than any other Her adventures while she remained a shopkeeper are not extremely important She has neglected to inform us how long she continued behind the counter but has told us however that by the liberality of her friends and the bounty of her subscribers she was set above want and that the autumn of her days was like to be spent in peace and serenity  But whatever were her prospects she lived not long to enjoy the comforts of competence for on the th of August a few years after the publication of her second volume she died at Dublin in the thirty ninth year of her age  Considered as a writer she holds no mean rank She was the author of The Turkish Court or The London Apprentice acted at the theatre in Caplestreet Dublin but never printed This piece was poorly performed otherwise it promised to have given great satisfaction The first act of her tragedy of the Roman Father is no ill specimen of her talents that way and throughout her Memoirs there are scattered many beautiful little pieces written with a true spirit of poetry though under all the disadvantages that wit can suffer Her memory seems to have been amazingly great of which her being able to repeat almost all Shakespear is an astonishing instance  One of the prettiest of her poetical performances is the following Address to the reverend  Dr Hales with whom she became acquainted at the house of captain Mead near HamptonCourt  To the Revd Dr HALES  Hail holy sage whose comprehensive mind  Not to this narrow spot of earth confin'd  Thro' num'rous worlds can nature's laws explore  Where none but Newton ever trod before  And guided by philosophy divine  See thro' his works th' Almighty Maker shine  Whether you trace him thro' you rolling spheres  Where crown'd with boundless glory he appears  Or in the orient sun's resplendent rays  His setting lustre or his noontide blaze  New wonders still thy curious search attend  Begun on earth in highest Heav'n to end  O while thou dost those Godlike works pursue  What thanks from humankind to thee are due  Whose error doubt and darkness you remove  And charm down knowledge from her throne above  Nature to thee her choicest secrets yields  Unlocks her springs and opens all her fields  Shews the rich treasure that her breast contains  In azure fountains or enamell'd plains  Each healing stream each plant of virtuous use  To thee their medicinal pow'rs produce  Pining disease and anguish wing their flight  And rosy health renews us to delight  When you with art the animal dissect  And with the microsopic aid inspect  Where from the heart unnumbered rivers glide  And faithful back return their purple tide  How fine the mechanism by thee display'd  How wonderful is ev'ry creature made  Vessels too small for sight the fluids strain  Concoct digest asiimilate sustain  In deep attention and surprize we gaze  And to life's author raptur'd pour out praise  What beauties dost thou open to the sight  Untwisting all the golden threads of light  Each parent colour tracing to its source  Distinct they live obedient to thy sorce  Nought from thy penetration is conceal'd  And light himself shines to thy soul reveal'd  So when the sacred writings you display  And on the mental eye shed purer day  In radiant colours truth array'd we see  Consess her charms and guided up by thee  Soaring sublime on contemplation's wings  The fountain seek whence truth eternal springs  Fain would I wake the consecrated lyre  And sing the sentiments thou didst inspire  But find my strength unequal to a theme  Which asks a Milton's or a Seraph's flame  If thro' weak words one ray of reason shine  Thine was the thought the errors only mine  Yet may these numbers to thy soul impart  The humble incense of a grateful heart  Trifles with God himself acceptance find  If offer'd with sincerity of mind  Then like the Deity indulgence shew  Thou most like him of all his works below  Mr THOMAS SOUTHERN  THIS eminent poet was born in Dublin on the year of the Restoration of Charles the Ild and received his early education at the university there In the th year of his age he quitted Ireland and as his intention was to pursue a lucrative profession he entered himself in the MiddleTemple But the natural vivacity of his mind overcoming considerations of advantage he quitted that state of life and entered into the more agreeable service of the Muses  Jacob    The first dramatic performance of Mr Southern his Persian Prince or Loyal Brother was acted in the year The story is taken from Thamas Prince of Persia a Novel and the scene is laid in Ispahan in Persia This play was introduced at a time when the Tory interest was triamphant in England and the character of the Loyal Brother was no doubt intended to compliment James Duke of York who afterwards rewarded the poet for his service To this Tragedy Mr Dryden wrote the Prologue and Epilogue which furnished Mr Southern with an opportunity of saying in his dedication  'That the Laureat's own pen secured me maintaining the outworks while I lay safe entrenched within his lines and malice illnature and censure were forced to grin at a distance'  The Prologue is a continued invective against the Whigs and whether considered as a party libel or an induction to a new play is in every respect unworthy of the great hand that wrote it His next  play was a Comedy called the Disappointment or the Mother in Fashion performed in the year After the accession of king James the IId to the throne when the duke of Monmouth made an unfortunate attempt upon his uncle's crown Mr Southern went into the army in the regiment of foot raised by the lord Ferrers afterwards commanded by the duke of Berwick and he had three commissions viz ensign lieutenant and captain under King James in that regiment  During the reign of this prince in the year before the Revolution he wrote a Tragedy called the Spartan Dame which however was not acted till the year The subject is taken from the Life of Agis in Plutarch where the character of Chelonis between the duties of a wife and daughter was thought to have a near resemblance to that of King William's Queen Mary  'I began this play says Mr Southern a year before the Revolution and near four acts written without any view Many things interfering with those times I laid by what I had written for seventeen years I shewed it then to the late duke of Devonshire who was in every regard a judge he told me he saw no reason why it might not have been acted the year of the Revolution I then finished it and as I thought cut out the exceptionable parts but could not get it acted not being able to persuade myself to the cutting off those limbs which I thought essential to the strength and life of it But since I found it must pine in obscurity without it I consented to the operation and after the amputation of every line very near to the number of it stands on its own legs still and by the favour of the town and indulging assistance of friends has come successfully forward on the stage'  This play was inimitably acted Mr Booth Mr Wilks Mr Cibber Mr Mills sen Mrs Oldsield and Mrs Porter all performed in it in their heighth of reputation and the full vigour of their powers  Mr Southern acknowledges in his preface to this play that the last scene of the third Act was almost all written by the honourable John Stafford father to the earl of Stafford Mr Southern has likewise acknowledged that he received from the bookseller as a price for this play l which at that time was very extraordinary He was the first who raised the advantage of play writing to a second and third night which Mr Pope mentions in the following manner  Southern born to raise  The price of Prologues and of Plays  The reputation which Mr Dryden gained by the many Prologues he wrote induced the players to be sollicitous to have one of his to speak which were generally well received by the public Mr Dryden's price for a Prologue had usually been five guineas with which sum Mr Southern presented him when he received from him a Prologue for one of his plays Mr Dryden returned the money and said to him  'Young man this is too little I must have ten guineas'  Mr Southern on this observ'd that his usual price was five guineas  'Yes answered Dryden it has been so but the players have hitherto had my labours too cheap for the future I must have ten guineas  From the information of a gentleman personally acquainted with Mr Southern who desires to have his name conceal'd  '  Mr Southern was industrious to draw all imaginable profits from his poetical labours Mr Dryden once took occasion to ask him how much he got by one of his plays to which he answered that he was really ashamed to inform him But Mr Dryden being a little importunate to know he plainly told him that by his last play he cleared seven hundred pounds which appeared astonishing to Mr Dryden  as he himself had never been able to acquire more than one hundred by any of his most successful pieces The secret is Mr Southern was not beneath the drudgery of sollicitation and often sold his tickets at a very high price by making applications to persons of distinction a degree of servility which perhaps Mr Dryden thought was much beneath the dignity of a poet and too much in the chara  ter of an underplayer  That Mr Dryden entertained a very high opinion of our author's abilities appears from his many expressions of kindness towards him He has prefixed a copy of verses to a Comedy of his called the Wife's Excuse acted in the year with very indifferent success Of this Comedy Mr Dryden had so high an opinion that he bequeathed to our poet the care of writing half the last act of his Tragedy of Cleomenes  'Which says Mr Southern when it comes into the world will appear to be so considerable a trust that all the town will pardon me for defending this play that preferred me to it'  Our author continued from time to time to entertain the public with his dramatic pieces the greatest part of which met with the success they deserved The night on which his Innocent Adultery was first acted which is perhaps the most moving play in any language a gentleman took occasion to ask Mr Dryden what was his opinion of Southern's genius to which that great poet replied  'That he thought him such another poet as Otway'  When this reply was communicated to Mr Southern he considered it as a very great compliment having no ambition to be thought a more considerable poet than Otway was  Of our author's Comedies none are in possession of the stage nor perhaps deserve to be so for in that province he is less excellent than in Tragedy The present Laureat who is perhaps  one of the best judges of Comedy now living being ask  d his opinion by a gentleman of Southern's comic dialogue answered That it might be denominated WhipSyllabub that is flashy and light but indurable and as it is without the Sal Atticum of wit can never much delight the intelligent part of the audience  The most finished and the most pathetic of Mr Southern's plays in the opinion of the critics is his Oroonoko or the Royal Slave This drama is built upon a true story related by Mrs Behn in a Novel and has so much the greater influence on the audience as they are sensible that the representation is no fiction In this piece Mr Southern has touched the tender passions with so much skill that it will perhaps be injurious to his memory to say of him that he is second to Otway Besides the tender and delicate strokes of passion there are many shining and manly sentiments in Oroonoko and one of the greatest genius's of the present age has often observed that in the most celebrated play of Shakespear so many striking thoughts and such a glow of animated poetry cannot be furnished This play is so often acted and admired that any illustration of its beauties here would be entirely superfluous His play of The Fatal Marriage or The Innocent Adultery met with deserved success the affecting incidents and interesting tale in the tragic part sufficiently compensate for the low trifling comic part and when the character of Isabella is acted as we have seen it by Mrs Porter and Mrs Wossington the ladies seldom fail to sympathise in grief  Mr Southern died on the th of May in the year in the th year of his age the latter part of which he spent in a peaceful serenity having by his commission as a soldier and the profits of his dramatic works acquired a handsome fortune and being an exact oeconomist he improved what  fortune he gained to the best advantage He enjoyed the longest life of all our poets and died the richest of them a very few excepted  A gentleman whose authority we have already quoted had likewise informed us that Mr Southern lived for the last ten years of his life in Westminster and attended very constant at divine service in the Abbey being particularly fond of church music He never staid within doors while in heal  h two days together having such a circle of acquaintance of the best rank that he constantly dined with one or other by a kind of rotation  The Revd Mr JAMES MILLER  THIS gentleman was born in the year He was the son of a clergyman who poss  ssed two considerable livings in Dorsetshire  The account of this gentleman is taken from the information of his widow  He recei  ed his education at WadhamCollege in Oxford and while he was resident in that university he composed part of his famous Comedy called the Humours of Oxford acted in the year by the particular recommendation of Mrs Oldfield  This piece as it was a lively representation of the follies and vices of the students of that place procured the author many enemies  Mr Miller was designed by his relations to be bred to business which he declined not being able to endure the servile drudgery it demanded He no sooner quitted the university than he entered into holy orders and was immediately preferred to be lecturer in TrinityCollege in ConduitStreet and preacher of RoehamptonChapel These livings were too inconsiderable to afford a genteel subsistence and therefore it may be supposed he had recourse to dramatic writing to encrease his finances This kind of composition however being reckoned by some very foreign to his profession if not inconsistent with it was thought to have retarded his preferment in the church Mr Miller was likewise attached to the HighChurch interest a circumstance in the times in which he lived not  very favourable to preferment He was so honest however in these principles that upon a large offer being made him by the agents for the ministry in the time of a general opposition he had virtue sufficient to withstand the temptation though his circumstances at that time were far from being easy Mr Miller often confessed to some of his friends that this was the fiery trial of his constancy He had received by his wife a very genteel fortune and a tenderness for her had almost overcome his resolutions but he recovered again to his former firmness when upon hinting to his wife the terms upon which preferment might be procured she rejected them with indignation and he became ashamed of his own wavering This was an instance of honour few of which are to be met with in the Lives of the Poets who have been too generally of a timeserving temper and too pliant to all the follies and vices of their age But though Mr Miller would not purchase preferment upon the terms of writing for the ministry he was content to stipulate never to write against them which proposal they rejected in their turn  About a year before Mr Miller's death which happened in he was presented by Mr Cary of Dorsetshire to the profitable living of Upsun his father had before possess'd but which this worthy man lived not long to enjoy nor had he ever an opportunity of making that provision for his family he so much sollicited and which he even disdained to do at the expence of his honour  Mr Miller's dramatic works are  I Humours of Oxford which we have already mentioned  II The MotherinLaw or the Doctor the Disease a Comedy  III The Man of Taste a Comedy acted in the year which had a run of nights  These two pieces were brought on the stage without the author's name being known which probably not a little contribut  d to their success the care of the rehearsals being left to Mr Theo Cibber who played the characters of the Man of Taste and Squire Headpiece    IV Universal Passion a Comedy  V Art and Nature a Comedy  VI The CoffeeHouse a Farce  VII An Hospital for Fools a Farce  VIII The Picture or Cuckold in Conceit  IX Mahomet the Impostor a Tragedy during the run of this play the author died  X Joseph and his Brethren a sacred Drama  Mr Miller was author of many occasional pieces in poetry of which his Harlequin Horace is the most considerable This Satire is dedicated to Mr Rich the present manager of CoventGarden Theatre in which with an ironical severity he lashes that gentleman in consequence of some offence Mr Rich had given him  Mr Miller likewise published a volume of Sermons all written with a distinguished air of piety and a becoming zeal for the interest of true religion and was principally concerned in the translation of Moliere's comedies published by Watts  Our author left behind him a son whose profession is that of a sea surgeon Proposals for publishing his Poems have been inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine with a specimen which does him honour The profits of this subscription are to be appropriated to his mother whom he chiefly supported an amiable instance of  lial piety  Mr NICHOLAS AMHURST  THIS gentleman well known to the world by the share he had in the celebrated anticourt paper called The Craftsman was born in Marden in Kent but in what year we cannot be certain Mr Amhurst's grandfather was a clergyman under whose protection and care he received his education at MerchantTaylors school Having received there the rudiments of learning he was removed to St John's College Oxford from which on account of the libertinism of his principles and some offence he gave to the head of that college it appears he was ejected We can give no other account of this affair than what is drawn from Mr Amhurst's dedication of his poems to Dr Delaune President of St John's College in Oxford This dedication abounds with mirth and pleasantry in which he rallies the Dr with very pungent irony and hints at the causes of his disgrace in that famous college In page of his dedication he says  'You'll pardon me good sir if I think it necessary for your honour to mention the many heinous crimes for which I was brought to shame None were indeed publicly alledged against me at that time because it might as well be done afterwards sure old Englishmen can never forget that there is such a thing as hanging a man for it and trying him afterwards so fared it with me my prosecutors first proved  me by an undeniable argument to be no fellow of St John's College and then to bethe Lord knows what  'My indictment may be collected out of the faithful annals of common same which run thus  'Advices from Oxford say that on the th of June one Nicholas Amhurst of St John's College was expelled for the following reasons  'Imprimis For loving foreign turnips and Presbyterian bishops  'Item For ingratitude to his benefactor that spotless martyr Sir William Laud  'Item For believing that steeples and organs are not necessary to salvation  'Item For preaching without orders and praying without a commission  'Item For lampooning priestcraft and petticoatcraft'  'Item For not lampooning the government and the revolution  'Item For prying into secret history  'My natural modesty will not permit me like other apologists to vindicate myself in any one particular the whole charge is so artfully drawn up that no reasonable person would ever think the better of me should I justify myself 'till doomsday'  Towards the close of the dedication he takes occasion to complain of some severities used against him at the time of his being excluded the college  'But I must complain of one thing whether reasonable or not let the world judge When I was voted out of your college and the nusance was thereby removed I thought the resentments of the holy ones would have proceeded no further I am sure the cause of virtue and found religion I was thought to offend required no more nor could it be of any possible advantage to the church to descend to my private affairs and stir up my creditors in the university  to take hold of me at a disadvantage before I could get any money returned but there are some persons in the world who think nothing unjust or inhuman in the prosecution of their implacable revenge'  It is probable that upon this misfortune happening to our author he repaired to the capital there to retrieve his ruined affairs We find him engaged deeply in the Craftsman when that paper was in its meridian and when it was more read and attended to than any political paper ever published in England on account of the assistance given to it by some of the most illustrious and important characters of the nation It is said that ten thousand of that paper have been sold in one day  The Miscellanies of Mr Amhurst the greatest part of which were written at the university consist chiefly of poems sacred and profane original paraphrased imitated and translated tales epigrams epistles loveverses elegies and satires The Miscellany begins with a beautiful paraphrase on the Mosaic Account of the Creation and ends with a very humorous tale upon the discovery of that useful utensil A BottleScrew  Mr Amhurst died of a fever at Twickenham April Our poet had a great enmity to the exorbitant demands and domineering spirit of the HighChurch clergy which he discovers by a poem of his called The convocation in five cantos a kind of satire against all the writers who shewed themselves enemies of the bishop of Bangor He translated The Resurrection and some other of Mr Addison's Latin pieces  He wrote an epistle with a petition in it to Sir John Blount Bart one of the directors of the SouthSea Company  Oculus Britanniae an Heroipanegyrical Poem on the University of Oxford vo  In a poem of Mr Amhurst's called An Epistle from the Princess Sobiesky to the Chevalier de St George he has the following nervous lines strongly expressive of the passion of love  Relentless walls and bolts obstruct my way  And guards as careless and as deaf as they  Or to my James thro' whirlwinds I would go  Thro' burning desarts and o'er alps of snow  Pass spacious roaring oceans undismay'd  And think the mighty dangers well repaid  Mr GEORGE LILLO  WAS by profession a jeweller He was born in London on the th of Feb He lived as we are informed near Moorgate in the same neighbourhood where he received his birth and where he was always esteemed as a person of unblemished character 'Tis said he was educated in the principles of the dissenters be that as it will his morals brought no disgrace on any sect or party Indeed his principal attachment was to the muses  His first piece brought on the stage was a Ballad Opera called Sylvia or The Country Burial performed at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln'sInn Fields but with no extraordinary success in the year The year following he brought his play called The London Merchant or The True Story of George Barnwell to Mr Cibber junior then manager of the summer company at the Theatre Royal in DruryLane who originally played the part of BarnwellThe author was  not then known As this was almost a new species of tragedy wrote on a very uncommon subject he rather chose it should take its fate in the summer than run the more hazardous fate of encountering the winter criticks The old ballad of George Barnwell on which the story was founded was on this occasion reprinted and many thousands sold in one day Many gailydisposed spirits brought the ballad with them to the play intending to make their pleasant remarks as some afterwards owned and ludicrous comparisons between the antient ditty and the modern drama But the play was very carefully got up and universally allowed to be well performed The piece was thought to be well conducted and the subject well managed and the diction proper and natural never low and very rarely swelling above the characters that spoke Mr Pope among other persons distinguished by their rank or particular publick merit had the curiosity to attend the performance and commended the actors and the author and remarked if the latter had erred through the whole play it was only in a few places where he had unawares led himself into a poetical luxuriancy affecting to be too elevated for the simplicity of the subject But the play in general spoke so much to the heart that the gay persons before mentioned confessed they were drawn in to drop their ballads and pull out their handkerchiefs It met with uncommon success for it was acted above twenty times in the summer season to great audiences was frequently bespoke by some eminent merchants and citizens who much approved its moral tendency and in the winter following was acted often to crowded houses And all the royal family at several different times honoured it with their appearance It gained reputation and brought money to the poet the managers and the performers Mr Cibber jun not only gave the author his usual  profits of his third days  c  but procured him a benefitnight in the winter season which turned out greatly to his advantage so that he had four benefitnights in all for that piece by the profits whereof and his copymoney he gained several hundred pounds It continued a stockplay in DruryLane Theatre till Mr Cibber left that house and went to the Theatre in CoventGarden It was often acted in the Christmas and Easter holidays and judged a proper entertainment for the apprentices  c  as being a more instructive moral and cautionary drama than many pieces that had been usually exhibited on those days with little but farce and ribaldry to recommend them  A few years after he brought out his play of The Christian Hero at the Theatre Royal in DruryLane  And another Tragedy called Elmerick  His tragedy of three acts called Fatal Curiosity founded on an old English story was acted with success at the HayMarket in  He wrote another tragedy never yet acted called Arden of Feversham  He was a man of strict morals great goodnature and sound sense with an uncommon share of modesty  He died Sept and was buried in the vault of Shoreditch church  Mr CHARLES JOHNSON  MR Charles Johnson was designed for the law but being an admirer of the muses turned his thoughts to dramatic writing and luckily being an intimate of Mr Wilks by the assistance of his friendship Mr Johnson had several plays acted  some of which met with success He was a constant attendant at Will's and Button's coffeehouses which were the resort of most of the men of taste and literature during the reigns of queen Anne and king George the first Among these he contracted intimacy enough to intitle him to their patronage  c  on his benefitnights by which means he lived with oeconomy genteelly At last he married a young widow with a tolerable fortune and set up a tavern in Bowstreet which he quitted on his wife's dying and lived privately on the small remainder of his fortune  He died about the year His parts were not very brilliant but his behaviour was generally thought inoffensive yet he escaped not the satire of Mr Pope who has been pleased to immortalize him in his Dunciad  His dramatic pieces are  The Gentleman Cully a Comedy acted at the TheatreRoyal CoventGarden  Fortune in her Wits a Comedy It is a very indifferent translation of Mr Cowley's Naufragium Joculare  The Force of Friendship a Tragedy  Love in a Chest a Farce  The Wife's Relief or the Husband's Cure a Comedy It is chiefly borrowed from Shirley's Gamester  The Successful Pirate a TragiComedy  The Generous Husband or the Coffeehouse Politician a Comedy  The Country Lasses or the Custom of the Manor a Comedy  Love and Liberty a Tragedy  The Victim a Tragedy  The Sultaness a Tragedy  The Cobler of Preston a Farce of two Acts  Love in a Forest a Comedy Taken from Shakespear's Comedy As you like it  The Masquerade a Comedy  The Village Opera  The Ephefian Matron a Farce of one Act  Celia or the Perjured Lovers a Tragedy  PHILIP FROWDE  Esq  THIS elegant poet was the son of a gentleman who had been postmastergeneral in the reign of queen Anne Where our author received his earliest instructions in literature we cannot ascertain but at a proper time of life he was sent to the university of Oxford where he had the honour of being particularly distinguished by Mr Addison who took him under his immediate protection While he remained at that university he became author of several poetical performances some of which in Latin were sufficiently elegant and pure to intitle them to a place in the Musae Anglicanae published by Mr Addison an honour so much the more distinguished as the purity of the Latin poems contained in that collection furnished the firsthint to Boileau of the greatness of the British genius That celebrated critick of France entertained a mean opinion of the English poets till he occasionally read the Musae Anglicanae and then he was persuaded that they who could write with so much elegance in a dead language must greatly excel in that which was native to them  Mr Frowde has likewise obliged the publick with two tragedies the Fall of Saguntum dedicated to sir Robert Walpole and Philotas addressed  to the earl of Chesterfield The first of these performances so far as we are able to judge has higher merit than the last The story is more important being the destruction of a powerful city than the fall of a single hero the incidents rising out of this great event are likewise of a very interesting nature and the scenes in many places are not without passion though justly subject to a very general criticism that they are written with too little Mr Frowde has been industrious in this play to conclude his acts with similes which however exceptionable for being too long and tedious for the situations of the characters who utter them yet are generally just and beautiful At the end of the first act he has the following simile upon sedition  Sedition thou art up and in the ferment  To what may not the madding populace  Gathered together for they scarce know what  Now loud proclaiming their late whisper'd grief  Be wrought at length Perhaps to yield the city  Thus where the Alps their airy ridge extend  Gently at first the melting snows descend  From the broad slopes with murm'ring lapse they glide  In soft meanders down the mountain's side  But lower fall'n streams with each other crost  From rock to rock impetuously are tost  'Till in the Rhone's capacious bed they're lost  United there roll rapidly away  And roaring reach o'er rugged rocks the sea  In the third act the poet by the mouth of a Roman hero gives the following concise definition of true courage  True courage is not where fermenting spirits  Mount in a troubled and unruly stream  The soul's its proper seat and reason there  Presiding guides its cool or warmer motions  The representation of besiegers driven back by the impetuosity of the inhabitants after they had entered a gate of the city is strongly pictured by the following simile  Imagine to thyself a swarm of bees  Driv'n to their hive by some impending storm  Which at its little pest in clustering heaps  And climbing o'er each other's backs they enter  Such was the people's flight and such their haste  To gain the gate  We have observed that Mr Frowde's other tragedy called Philotas was addressed to the earl of Chesterfield and in the dedication he takes care to inform his lordship that it had obtained his private approbation before it appeared on the stage At the time of its being acted lord Chesterfield was then embassador to the statesgeneral and consequently he was deprived of his patron's countenance during the representation As to the fate of this play he informs his lordship it was very particular  "And I hope says he it will not be imputed as vanity to me when I explain my meaning in an expression of Juvenal Laudatur alget"  But from what cause this misfortune attended it we cannot take upon us to say  Mr Frowde died at his lodgings in Cecilstreet in the Strand on the th of Dec In the London Daily Post d December the following amiable character is given of our poet  "But though the elegance of Mr Frowde's writings has recommended him to the general publick esteem the politeness of his genius is the least amiable part of his character for he esteemed the talents of wit and learning only as they were conducive to the excitement and practice of honour and humanity Therefore  with a soul chearful benevolent and virtuous he was in conversation genteelly delightful in friendship punctually sincere in death christianly resigned No man could live more beloved no private man could die more lamented"  Mrs MARY CHANDLER  WAS born at Malmsbury in Wiltshire in the year of worthy and reputable parents her father Mr Henry Chandler being minister many years of the congregation of protestant dissenters in Bath whose integrity candour and catholick spirit gained him the esteem and friendship of all ranks and parties She was his eldest daughter and trained up carefully in the principles of religion and virtue But as the circumstances of the family rendered it necessary that she should be brought up to business she was very early employed in it and incapable of receiving that polite and learned education which she often regretted the loss of and which she afterwards endeavoured to repair by diligently reading and carefully studying the best modern writers and as many as she could of the antient ones especially the poets as far as the best translations could assist her  Amongst these Horace was her favourite and how just her sentiments were of that elegant writer will fully appear from her own words in a letter to an intimate friend relating to him in which she thus expresses herself  "I have been reading Horace this month past in the best translation I could procure of him O could I read his fine sentiments cloathed in his own dress what would I what would I not give He is more my favourite  than Virgil or Homer I like his subjects his easy manner It is nature within my view He doth not lose me in fable or in the clouds amidst gods and goddesses who more brutish than myself demand my homage nor hurry me into the noise and confusion of battles nor carry me into inchanted circles to conjure with witches in an unknown land but places me with persons like myself and in countries where every object is familiar to me In short his precepts are plain and morals intelligible though not always so perfect as one could have wished them But as to this I consider when and where he lived"  The hurries of life into which her circumstances at Bath threw her sat frequently extremely heavy upon a mind so intirely devoted to books and contemplation as hers was and as that city especially in the seasons but too often furnished her with characters in her own sex that were extremely displeasing to her she often in the most passionate manner lamented her fate that tied her down to so disagreeable a situation for she was of so extremely delicate and generous a soul that the imprudences and faults of others gave her a very sensible pain though she had no other connexion with or interest in them but what arose from the common ties of human nature This made her occasional retirements from that place to the countryseats of some of her peculiarly intimate and honoured friends doubly delightful to her as she there enjoyed the solitude she loved and could converse without interruption with those objects of nature that never failed to inspire her with the most exquisite satisfaction One of her friends whom she highly honoured and loved and of whose hospitable house and pleasant gardens she was allowed the freest use was the late excellent Mrs Stephens of Sodbury in Gloucestershire whose seat she celebrated  in a poem inscribed to her inserted in the collection she published A lady that was worthy of the highest commendation her muse could bestow upon her The fine use she made of solitude the few following lines she wrote on it will be an honourable testimony to her  Sweet solitude the Muses dear delight  Serene thy day and peaceful is thy night  Thou nurse of innocence fair virtue's friend  Silent tho' rapturous pleasures thee attend  Earth's verdant scenes the allsurrounding skies  Employ my wondring thoughts and feast my eyes  Nature in ev'ry object points the road  Whence contemplation wings my soul to God  He's all in all His wisdom goodness pow'r  Spring in each blade and bloom in ev'ry flow'r  Smile o'er the meads and bend in ev'ry hill  Glide in the stream and murmur in the rill  All nature moves obedient to his will  Heav'n shakes earth trembles and the forests nod  When awful thunders speak the voice of God  However notwithstanding her love of retirement and the happy improvement she knew how to make of it yet her firm belief that her station was the appointment of providence and her earnest defire of being useful to her relations whom she regarded with the warmest affection brought her to submit to the fatigues of her business to which during thirtyfive years she applied herself with the utmost diligence and care  Amidst such perpetual avocations and constant attention to business her improvements in knowledge and her extensive acquaintance with the best writers are truly surprising But she well knew the worth of time and eagerly laid hold of all her leisure hours not to lavish them away in fashionable unmeaning amusements but in the pursuit  of what she valued infinitely more those substantial acquisitions of true wisdom and goodness which she knew were the noblest ornaments of the reasonable mind and the only sources of real and permanent happiness and she was the more desirous of this kind of accomplishments as she had nothing in her shape to recommend her being grown by an accident in her childhood very irregular in her body which she had resolution enough often to make the subject of her own pleasantry drawing this wise inference from it  "That as her person would not recommend her she must endeavour to cultivate her mind to make herself agreeable"  And indeed this she did with the greatest care and she had so many excellent qualities in her that though her first appearance could never create any prejudice in her favour yet it was impossible to know her without valuing and esteeming her  Wherever she professed friendship it was sincere and cordial to the objects of it and though she admired whatever was excellent in them and gave it the commendations it deserved yet she was not blind to their faults especially if such as she apprehended to be inconsistent with the character of integrity and virtue As she thought one of the noblest advantages of real friendship was the rendering it serviceable mutually to correct polish and perfect the characters of those who professed it and as she was not displeased to be kindly admonished herself for what her friends thought any little disadvantage to her character so she took the same liberty with others but used that liberty with such a remarkable propriety tenderness and politeness as made those more sincerely esteem her with whom she used the greatest freedom and has lost her no intimacy but with one person with whom for particular reasons she thought herself obliged to break off all correspondence  Nor could one who had so perfect a veneration and love for religion and virtue fail to make her own advantage of the admonitions and reproofs she gave to others and she often expressed a very great pleasure that the care she had of those young persons that were frequently committed to her friendship put her upon her guard as to her own temper and conduct and on a review of her own actions lest she should any way give them a wrong example or omit any thing that was really for their good And if she at any time reflected that her behaviour to others had been wrong she with the greatest ease and frankness asked the pardon of those she had offended as not daring to leave to their wrong construction any action of hers lest they should imagine that she indulged to those faults for which she took the liberty of reproving them Agreeable to this happy disposition of mind she gave in an offhand manner the following advice to an intimate friend who had several children whom she deservedly honoured and whom she could not esteem and love beyond his real merits  To virtue strict to merit kind  With temper calm to trifles blind  Win them to mend the faults they see  And copy prudent rules from thee  Point to examples in their sight  T' avoid and scorn and to delight  Then love of excellence inspire  By hope their emulation fire  You'll gain in time your own desire  She used frequently to complain of herself as naturally eager anxious and peevish But by a constant cultivation of that benevolent disposition that was never inwrought in any heart in a stronger and more prevailing manner than in hers she in a good measure dispossest herself of those inward sources  of uneasiness and was pleased with the victory she had gained over herself and continually striving to render it more absolute and complete  Her religion was rational and prevalent She had in the former part of her life great doubts about christianity during which state of uncertainty she was one of the most uneasy and unhappy persons living But her own good sense her inviolable attachment to religion and virtue her impartial inquiries her converse with her believing friends her study of the best writers in defence of christianity and the observations she made on the temper and conduct the fall and ruin of some that had discarded their principles and the irregularities of others who never attended to them fully at last released her from all her doubts and made her a firm and established christian The immediate consequence of this was the return of her peace the possession of herself the enjoyment of her friends and an intire freedom from the terror of any thing that could befall her in the future part of her existence Thus she lived a pleasure to all who knew her and being at length resolved to disengage herself from the hurries of life and wrap herself up in that retirement she was so fond of after having gained what she thought a sufficient competency for one of her moderate desires and in that station that was allotted her and settled her affairs to her own mind she finally quitted the world and in a manner agreeable to her own wishes without being suffered to lie long in weakness and pain a burthen to herself or those who attended her dying after about two days illness in the th year of her age Sept  She thought the disadvantages of her shape were such as gave her no reasonable prospect of being happy in a married state and therefore chose to continue single She had however an honourable offer from a country gentleman of worth and large  fortune who attracted merely by the goodness of her character took a journey of an hundred miles to visit her at Bath where he made his addresses to her But she convinced him that such a match could neither be for his happiness or her own She had however something extremely agreeable and pleasing in her face and no one could enter into any intimacy of conversation with her but he immediately lost every disgust towards her that the first appearance of her person tended to excite in him  She had the misfortune of a very valetudinary constitution owing in some measure probably to the irregularity of her form At last after many years illness she entered by the late ingenious Dr Cheney's advice into the vegetable diet and indeed the utmost extremes of it living frequently on bread and water in which she continued so long as rendered her incapable of taking any more substantial food when she afterwards needed it for want of which she was so weak as not to be able to support the attack of her last disorder and which I doubt not hastened on her death But it must be added in justice to her character that the ill state of her health was not the only or principal reason that brought her to and kept her fixed in her resolution of attempting and persevering in this mortifying diet The conquest of herself and subjecting her own heart more intirely to the command of her reason and principles was the object she had in especial view in this change of her manner of living as being firmly persuaded that the perpetual free use of animal food and rich wines tends so to excite and inflame the passions as scarce to leave any hope or chance for that conquest of them which she thought not only religion requires but the care of our own happiness renders necessary And the effect of the trial in her own case was  answerable to her wishes and what she says of herself in her own humorous epitaph  That time and much thought had all passion extinguish'd  was well known to be true by those who were most nearly acquainted with her Those admirable lines on  Temperance  in her Bath poem she penned from a very feeling experience of what she found by her own regard to it and can never be read too often as the sense is equal to the goodness of the poetry  Fatal effects of luxury and ease  We drink our poison and we eat disease  Indulge our senses at our reason's cost  Till sense is pain and reason hurt or lost  Not so O temperance bland when rul'd by thee  The brute's obedient and the man is free  Soft are his slumbers balmy is his rest  His veins not boiling from the midnight feast  Touch'd by Aurora's rosy hand he wakes  Peaceful and calm and with the world partakes  The joyful dawnings of returning day  For which their grateful thanks the whole creation pay  All but the human brute 'Tis he alone  Whose works of darkness fly the rising sun  'Tis to thy rules O temperance that we owe  All pleasures which from health and strength can flow  Vigour of body purity of mind  Unclouded reason sentiments refin'd  Unmixt untained joys without remorse  Th' intemperate sinner's neverfailing curse  She was observed from her childhood to have a fondness for poetry often entertaining her companions  in a winter's evening with riddles in verse and was extremely fond at that time of life of Herbert's poems And this disposition grew up with her and made her apply in her riper years to the study of the best of our English poets and besore she attempted any thing considerable sent many small copies of verses on particular characters and occasions to her peculiar friends Her poem on the Bath had the full approbation of the publick and what sets it above censure had the commendation of Mr Pope and many others of the first rank for good sense and politeness And indeed there are many lines in it admirably penn'd and that the finest genius need not to be ashamed of It hath ran through several editions and when first published procured her the personal acknowledgments of several of the brightest quality and of many others greatly distinguished as thē best judges of poetical performances  She was meditating a nobler work a large poem on the Being and Attributes of God which was her favourite subject and if one may judge by the imperfect pieces of it which she left behind her in her papers would have drawn the publick attention had she liv'd to finish it  She was peculiarly happy in her acquaintance as she had good sense enough to discern that worth in others she justly thought was the foundation of all real friendship and was so happy as to be honoured and loved as a friend by those whom she would have wished to be connected with in that sacred character She had the esteem of that most excellent lady who was superior to all commendation the late dutchess of Somerset then countess of Hertford who hath done her the honour of several visits and allowed her to return them at the Mount of Marlborough Mr Pope favoured her with his at Bath and complimented her for her poem on that place Mrs Rowe of  room was one of her  particular friends 'Twould be endless to name  ll the persons of reputation and fortune whom she had the pleasure of being intimately acquainted with She was a good woman a kind relation and a saithful friend She had a real genius for poetry was a most agreeable correspondent had a large fund of good sense was unblemished in her character lived highly esteemed and died greatly lamented  FINIS
