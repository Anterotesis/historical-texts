adamantine fame  J T to Mem of Gray  London  PRINTED AND EMBELLISHED Under the Direction of C COOKE  THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY  THOMAS GRAY was born in Cornhill in the city of London on the th of December His father Philip Gray was a moneyscrivener but being of an indolent and profuse disposition he rather diminished than improved his paternal fortune Our Author received his classical education at Eton school under Mr Antrobus his mother's brother a man of sound learning and refined taste who directed his nephew to those pursuits which laid the foundation of his future literary fame  During his continuance at Eton he contracted a friendship with Mr Horace Walpole well known for his knowledge in the fine arts and Mr Richard West son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland a youth of very promising talents  When he left Eton school in he went to Cambridge and entered a pensioner at Peterhouse at the recommendation of his uncle Antrobus who had been a fellow of that college It is said that from his effeminacy and fair complexion he acquired among his fellow students the appellation of  Miss  Gray to which the delicacy of his manners seems not a little to have contributed Mr Walpole was at that time a fellowcommoner of King's College in the same University a fortunate circumstance which afforded Gray frequent opportunities of intercourse with his Honourable Friend  Mr West went from Eton to Christ Church Oxford and in this state of separation these two votaries of the Muses whose dispositions were congenial commenced an epistolary correspondence part of which is published by Mr Mason a gentleman whose character stands high in the republic of letters  Gray having imbibed a taste for poetry did not relish those abstruse studies which generally occupy the minds of students at College and therefore as he found very little gratification from academical pursuits he left Cambridge in and returned to London intending to apply himself to the study of the law but this intention was soon laid aside upon an invitation given him by Mr Walpole to accompany him in his travels abroad a situation highly preferable in Gray's opinion to the dry study of the law  They set out together for France and visited most of the places worthy of notice in that country from thence they proceeded to Italy where an unfortunate dispute taking place between them a separation ensued upon their arrival at Florence Mr Walpole afterwards with great candour and liberality took upon himself the blame of the quarrel though if we consider the matter coolly and impartially we may be induced to conclude that Gray from a conscious superiority of ability might have claimed a deference to his opinion and judgment which his Honourable Friend was not at that time disposed to admit the rupture however was very unpleasant to both parties  Gray pursued his journey to Venice on an economic plan suitable to the circumscribed state of his finances and having continued there some weeks returned to England in September He appears from his letters published by Mr Mason to have paid the minutest attention to every object worthy of notice throughout the course of his travels His descriptions are lively and picturesque and bear particular marks of his genius and disposition We admire the sublimity of his ideas when he ascends the stupendous heights of the Alps and are charmed with his display of nature decked in all the beauties of vegetation Indeed abundant information as well as entertainment may be derived from his casual letters  In about two months after his arrival in England he lost his father who by an indiscreet profusion had so impaired his fortune as not to admit of his son's prosecuting the study of the law with that degree of respectability which the nature of the profession requires without becoming burthensome to his mother and aunt To obviate therefore their importunities on the subject he went to Cambridge and took his bachelor's degree in civil law  But the inconveniencies and distress attached to a scanty fortune were not the only ills our Poet had to encounter at this time he had not only lost the friendship of Mr Walpole abroad but poor West the partner of his heart fell a victim to complicated maladies brought on by family misfortunes on the st of June at Popes a village in Hertfordshire where he went for the benefit of the air  The excessive degree in which his mind was agitated for the loss of his friend will best appear from the following beautiful little sonnet  " In vain to me the smiling mornings shine  " And redd'ning Poebus lifts his go  den fire  " The birds in  ain their am'rous descant join  " Or cheerful fields resume their green attire  " These ears alas for other notes repine  " A different object do these eyes require  " My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine  " And in my breast th' imperfect joys expire  " Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer  " And newborn pleasure brings to happier men  " The fields to all their wonted tribute bear  " To warn their little loves the birds comp  ain  " I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear  " And weep the more because I weep in vain'  Mr Gray now seems to have applied his mind very sedulously to poetical composition his  Ode to Spring  was written early in June to his friend Mr West before he received the melancholy news of his death how our Poet's susceptible mind was affected by that melancholy incident is evidently demonstrated by the lines quoted above the impression indeed appears  to have been too deep to be soon effaced and the tenour of the subjects which called for the exertions of his poetical talents subsequent to the production of this Ode corroborates that observation these were his  Prospect of Eton  and his  Ode to Adversity  It is also supposed and with great probability that he began his  Elegy in a Country Church Yard  about the same time He passed some weeks at Stoke near Windsor where his mother and aunt resided and in that pleasing retirement finished several of his most celebrated Poems  From thence he returned to Cambridge which from this period was his chief residence during the remainder of his life The conveniencies with which a college life was attended to a person of his narrow fortune and studious turn of mind were more than a compensation for the dislike which for several reasons he bore to the place but he was perfectly reconciled to his situation on Mr Mason's being elected a fellow of PembrokeHall a circumstance which brought him a companion who during life retained for him the highest degree of friendship and esteem  In he was admittted to the degree of Batchelor in the Civil Law as appears from a letter written to his particular friend Dr Wharton of Old Park near Durham formerly fellow of Pembroke Hall Cambridge in which he ridicules with much point and humour the  lies and foibles and the dullness and formality which prevailed in the University  In order to enrich his mind with the ideas of others he devoted a considerable portion of his time to the study of the best Greek authors so that in the course or six years there were hardly any writers of eminence in that language whose works he had not only read but thoroughly digested  His attention however to the Greek classics did not wholly engross his time for he found leisure  to advert in a new sarcastical manner to the ignorance and dullness with which he was surrounded though situated in the centre of learning There is only a fragment remaining of what he had written on this subject from which it may be inferred that it was intended as an  Hymn to Ignorance  The fragment is wholly introductory yet many of the lines are so pointed in signification and harmonious in versification that they will be admitted by the admirers of verse to display his poetical talents with more brilliancy than appears in many of his lyric productions  Hail horrors hail ye ever gloomy bowers  Ye Gothic fanes and antiquated towers  Where rushy Camus' slowlywinding flood  Perpetual draws his humid train of mud  Glad I revisit thy neglected reign  Oh take me to thy peaceful shade again  But chiefly thee whose influence breath'd from high  Augments the native darkness of the sky  Ah Ignorance soft salutary power  Prostrate with filial reverence I adore  Thrice hath Hyperion roll'd his annual race  Since weeping I forsook thy fond embrace  Oh say successful dost thou still oppose  Thy leaden Aegis 'gainst our ancient foes  Still stretch tenacious of thy right divine  The massy sceptre o'er thy slumbering line  And dews Lethean through the land dispense  To steep in slumbers each benighted sense  If any spark of wit's delusive ray  Break out and flash a momentary day  With damp cold touch forbid it to aspire  And huddle up in fogs the dangerous fire  Oh sayShe hears me not but careless grown  Lethargic nods upon her ebon throne  Goddess awake arise alas my fears  Can powers immortal feel the force of years  Not thus of old with ensigns wide unfurl'd  She rode triumphant o'er the vanquish'd world  Fierce nations own'd her unresisted might  And all was ignorance and all was night  Oh sacred age Oh times for ever lost  The schoolman's glory and the churchman's boast  For ever goneyet still to fancy new  Her rapid wings the transient scene pursue  And bring the buried ages back to view  High on her car behold the grandam ride  Like old Sefostris with barbaric pride  ***** a team of harness'd monarchs' bend  *****  In he seems to have given up his attention to the Muses Mr Walpole desirous of preserving what he had already written as well as perpetuating the merit of their deceased friend West endeavoured to prevail with Gray to whom he had previously become reconciled to publish his own Poems together with those of West but Gray declined it conceiving their productions united would not suffice to fill even a small volume  In Gray became acquainted with Mr Mason then a scholar of St John's College and afterwards Fellow of Pembroke Hall Mr Mason who was a man of great learning and ingenuity had written the year before his "Monody on the Death of Pope" and his "II Bellicoso" and "Il Pacifico" and Gray revised these pieces at the request of a friend This laid the foundation of a friendship that terminated but with life and Mr Mason after the death of Gray testified his regard for him by superintending the publication of his works  The same year he wrote a little Ode on the Death of a favourite Cat of Mr Walpole's in which humour and instruction are happily blended but the following year he produced an effort of much more importance the Fragment of an  Essay on the Alliance of Education and Government  Its tendency was to demonstrate the necessary concurrence of both to form great and useful Men It opens with the two following similies The exordium is rather uncommon but he seems to have adopted it as a kind of clue to the subject he meant to pursue in the subsequent part of the Poem  As sickly plants betray a niggard earth  Whose barren bosom starves her gen'rous birth  Nor genial warmth nor genial juice retains  Their roots to feed and fill their verdant veins  And as in climes where Winter holds his reign  The soil tho' fertile will not teem in vain  Forbids her gems to swell her shades to rise  Nor trusts her blossoms to the charlish skies  So draw mankind in vain the vital airs  Unform'd unfriended by those kindly cares  That health and vigour to the soul impart  Spread the young thought and warm the op'ning heart  so fond instruction on the growing pow'rs  Of Nature idly lavishes her stores  If equal Justice with unclouded face  Smile not indulgent on the rising race  And scatter with a free tho' frugal hand  Light golden show'rs of plenty o'er the land  But Tyranny has fix'd her empire there  To check their tender hopes with chilling fear  And blast the blooming promise of the year  This spacious animated scene survey  From where the rolling orb that gives the day  His sable sons with nearer course surrounds  To either pole and life's remotest bounds  How rude soe'er th' exterior form we find  Howe'er opinion tinge the vary'd mind  Alike to all the kind impartial Heav'n  The sparks of truth and happiness has given  With sense to feel with mem'ry to retain  They follow pleasure and they fly from pain  Their judgment mends the plan their fancy draws  Th' event presages and explores the cause  The soft returns of gratitude they know  By fraud elude by force repel the foe  While mutual wishes mutual woes endear  The social smile and sympathetic tear  Say then thro' ages by what fate confin'd  To diff'rent climes seem diff'rent souls assign'd  Here measur'd laws and philosophic ease  Fix and improve the polish'd arts of peace  There Industry and Gain their vigils keep  Command the winds and tame th' unwilling deep  Here force and hardy deeds of blood prevail  There languid Pleasure sighs in ev'ry gale  Oft' o'er the trembling nations from afar  Has Scythia breath'd the living cloud of war  And where the deluge burst with sweepy sway  Their arms their kings their gods were roll'd away  As oft' have issu'd host impelling host  The blueey'd myriads from the Baltic coast  The prostrate South to the destroyer yields  Her boasted titles and her golden fields  With grim delight the brood of Winter view  A brighter day and heav'ns of azure hue  Scent the new fragrance of the breathing rose  And quaff the pendent vintage as it grows  Proud of the yoke and pliant to the rod  Why yet does Asia dread a monarch's nod  While European freedom still withstands  Th' encreaching tide that drowns her less'ning lands  And sees far off with an indignant groan  Her native plains and empires once her own  Can op'ner skies and sons of fiercer flame  O'erpower the fire that animates our frame  As lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray  Fade and expire beneath the eye of day  Need we the influence of the northern star  To string our nerves and steel our hearts to war  And where the face of Nature laughs around  Must sick'ning Virtue fly the tainted ground  Unmanly thought what seasons can controul  What fancy'd zone can circumscribe the soul  Who conscious of the source from whence she springs  By Reason's light on Resolution's wings  Spite of her frail companion dauntless goes  O'er Lybia's deserts and thro' Zembla's snows  She bids each slumb'ring energy awake  Another touch another temper take  Suspends th' inferior laws that rule our clay  The stubborn elements confess her sway  Their little wants their low desires refine  And raise the mortal to a height divine  Not but the human fabric from the birth  Imbibes a flavour of its parent earth  As various tracts enforce a various toil  The manners speak the idiom of their soil  An iron race the mountaincliffs maintain  Foes to the gentler genius of the plain  For where unweary'd sinews must be found  With sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground  To turn the torrent's swiftdescending flood  To brave the savage rushing from the wood  What wonder if to patient valour train'd  They guard with spirit what by strength they gain'd  And while their rocky ramparts round they see  The rough abode of Want and Liberty  As lawless force from confidence will grow  Insult the plenty of the vales below  What wonder in the sultry climes that spread  Where Nile redundant o'er his summerbed  From his broad bosom life and verdure flings  And broods o'er Aegypt with his wat'ry wings  If with advent'rous oar and ready sail  The dusky people drive before the gale  Or on frail floats to neighbouring cities ride  That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide  It is much to be lamented that our Author did not finish what was so successfully begun as the Fragment is deemed superior to every thing in the same style of writing which our language can boast  In he put his finishing stroke to his  Elegy written in a Country Churchyard  which was communicated first to his friend Mr Walpole and by him to many persons of rank and distinction This beautiful production introduced the author to the favour of Lady Cobham and gave occasion to a singular composition  called  A Long Story  in which various effusions of wit and humour are very happily interspersed  The Elegy having found its way into the "Magazine of Magazines" the Author wrote to Mr Walpole requesting he would put it into the hands of Mr Dodsley and order him to print it immediately in order to rescue it from the disgrace it might have incurred by its appearance in a Magazine The Elegy was the most popular of all our Author's productions it ran through eleven editions and was translated into Latin by Anstey and Roberts and in the same year a version of it was published by Lloyd Mr Bentley an eminent Artist of that time wishing to decorate this elegant composition with every ornament of which it is so highly deserving drew for it a set of designs as he also did for the rest of Gray's productions for which the artist was liberally repaid by the Author in some beautiful Stanzas but unfortunately no perfect copy of them remains The following however are given as a specimen  " In silent gaze the tuneful choir among  " Half pleas'd half blushing let the muse admire  " While Bentley leads her sister art along  " And bids the pencil answer to the lyre  " See in their course each transitory thought  " Fix'd by his touch a lasting essence take  " Each dream in fancy's airy colouring wrought  " To local symmetry and life awake  " The tardy rhymes that us'd to linger on  " To censure cold and negligent or fame  " In swifter measures animated run  " And catch a lustre from his genuine flame  " Ah could they catch his strength his easy grace  " His quick creation his unerring line  " The energy of Pope they might efface  " And Dryden's harmony submit to mine  " But not to one in this benighted age  " Is that diviner inspiration giv'n  " That burns in Shakesocar's or in Milton's page  " The pomp and prod  gality of heav'n  " As when conspiring in the di'mond's blaze  " The meaner gems that singly charm the sight  " Together dart their intermingled rays  " And dazzle with a luxury of light  " Enough for me if to some feeling breast  " My lines a secret sympathy impart  " And as their pleasing influence flows confess'd  " A sigh of soft reflection heave the heart"  It appears by a letter to Dr Wharton that Gray finished his Ode on the  Progress of Poetry  early in The  Bard  also was begun about the same time and the following beautiful Fragment on the  Pleasure arising from Vicissitude  the next year The merit of the two former pieces was not immediately perceived nor generally acknowledged Garrick wrote a few lines in their praise Lloyd and Colman wrote in concert two Odes to "Oblivion" and "Obscurity" in which they were ridiculed with much ingenuity  " Now the golden morn aloft  " Waves her dewbespangled wing  " With vermil cheek and whisper soft  " She wooes the tardy spring  " Till April starts and calls around  " The sleeping fragrance from the ground  " And lightly o'er the living scene  " Scatters his freshest tenderest green  " New born flocks in rustic dance  " Frisking ply their feeble feet  " Forgetful of their wint'ry trance  " The birds his presence greet  " But chief the skylark warb  es high  " His trembling thrilling extacy  " And lessening from the dazzled sight  " Melts into air and liquid light  " Yesterday the sullen year  " Saw the snowy whirlwind fly  " Mute was the music of the air  " The herd stood drooping by  " Their raptures now that wildly flow  " No yesterday nor morrow know  " 'Tis man alone that joy descries  " With forward and reverted eyes  " Smiles on past misfortune's brow  " Soft reflection's hand can trace  " And o'er the check of sorrow throw  " A melancholy grace  " While hope prolongs our happier hour  " Or deepest shades that dimly lower  " And blacken round our weary way  " Gilds with a gleam of distant day  " Still where rosy pleasure leads  " See a kindred grief pursue  " Behind the steps that misery treads  " Approaching comfort view  " The hues of bliss more brightly glow  " Chastiz'd by sabler tints of woe  " And blended form with artf  l strife  " The strength and harmony of life  " See the wretch that long has tost  " On the thorny bed of Pain  " At length repair his vigour lost  " And breathe and walk again  " The meanest flow'ret of the vale  " The simplest note that swells the gale  " The common sun the air the skies  " To him are opening Paradise"  Our Author's reputation as a Poet was so high that on the death of Colley Cibber in he had the honour of refusing the office of PoetLaureat to which he was probably induced by the disgrace brought upon it through the inability of some who had filled it  His curiosity some time after drew him away from Cambridge to a lodging near the British Museum where he resided near three years reading and transcribing  In on the death of Mr Turner Professor of Modern Languages and History at Cambridge he was according to his own expression "cockered and spirited up" to apply to Lord Bute for the succession His Lordship refused him with all the politeness of a courtier the office having been previously promised to Mr Brocket the tutor of Sir James Lowther  His health being on the decline in he undertook a journey to Scotland conceiving he should derive benefit from exercise and change of situation His account of that country as far as it extends is curious and elegant for as his mind was comprehensive it was employed in the contemplation of all the  works of art all the appearances of nature and all the monuments of past events  During his stay in Scotland he contracted a friendship with Dr Beattie in whom he found as he himself expresses it a poet a philosopher and a good man Through the intervention of his friend the Doctor the Marischal College at Aberdeen offered him the degree of Doctor of Laws which he thought it decent to decline having omitted to take it at Cambridge  In December Dr Beattie still desirous that his country should leave a memento of its regard to the merit of our Poet solicited his permission to print at the University of Glasgow an elegant edition of his works Gray could not comply with his friend's request as he had given his promise to Mr Dodsley However as a compliment to them both he presented them with a copy containing a few notes and the imitations of the old Norwegian poetry intended to supplant the Long Story which was printed at first to illustrate Mr Bentley's designs  In our Author obtained that office without solicitation for which he had before applied without effect The Professorship of Languages and History again became vacant and he received an offer of it from the Duke of Grafton who had succeeded Lord Bute in office The place was valuable in itself the salary being l a year but it was rendered peculiarly acceptable to Mr Gray as he obtained it without solicitation  Soon after he succeeded to this office the impaired state of his health rendered another journey necessary and he visited in the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland His remarks on the wonderful scenery which these northern regions display he transmitted in epistolary journals to his friend Dr Wharton which abound according to Mr Mason's elegant  diction with all the wildness of Salvator and the softness of Claude  He appears to have been much affected by the anxiety he felt at holding a place without discharging the duties annexed to it He had always designed reading lectures but never put it in practice and a consciousness of this neglect contributed not a little to increase the malady under which he had long laboured nay the office at length became so irksome that he seriously proposed to resign it  Towards the close of May he removed from Cambridge to London after having suffered violent attacks of an hereditary gout to which he had long been subject notwithstanding he had observed the most rigid abstemiousness throughout the whole course of his life By the advice of his physicians he removed from London to Kensington the air of which place proved so salutary that he was soon enabled to return to Cambridge whence he designed to make a visit to his friend Dr Wharton at Old Park near Durham indulging a fond hope that the excursion would tend to the reestablishment of his health but alas that hope proved delusive On the th of July he was seized while at dinner in the College hall with a sudden nausea which obliged him to retire to his chamber The gout had fixed on his stomach in such a degree as to resist all the powers of medicine On the th he was attacked with a strong convulsion which returned with increased violence the ensuing day and on the evening of the  st of May  he departed this life in the th year of his age  From the narrative of his friend Mr Mason it appears that Gray was actuated by motives of self improvement and self gratification in his application to the Muses rather than any view to pecuniary emolument His pursuits were in general disinterested and as he was free from avarice on the one hand so was he from extravagance on the other being one of  those few characters in the annals of literature especially in the poetical class who are devoid of self interest and at the same time attentive to economy but Mr Mason adds that he was induced to decline taking any advantage of his literary productions by a degree of pride which influenced him to disdain the idea of being thought an author by profession  It appears from the same narrative that Gray made considerable progress in the study of architecture particularly the gothic He endeavoured to trace this branch of the science from the period of its commencement through its various changes till it arrived at its perfection in the time of Henry VIII He applied himself also to the study of heraldry of which he obtained a very competent knowledge as appears from his  Remarks on Saxon Churches  in the introduction to Mr Bentham's  History of Ely  But the favourite study of Gray for the last two years of his life was natural history which he rather resumed than began as he had acquired some knowledge of botany in early life while he was under the tuition of his uncle Antrobus He wrote copious marginal notes to the works of Linnaeus and other writers in the three kingdoms of nature and Mr Mason further observes that excepting pure mathematics and the studies dependent on that science there was hardly any part of human learning in which he had not acquired a competent skill in most of them a consummate mastery  Mr Mason has declined drawing any formal character of him but has adopted one from a letter to James Boswell Esq by the Rev Mr Temple Rector of St Gluvias in Cornwall first printed anonymously in the London Magazine which as we conceive authentic from the sanction of Mr Mason we shall therefore transcribe  Perhaps he was the most learned man in Europe He was equally acquainted with the elegant and profound parts of science and that not superficially but  thoroughly He knew every branch of history both natural and civil had read all the original historians of England France and Italy and was a great antiquarian Criticism metaphysics morals and politics made a principal part of his study voyages and travels of all sorts were his favourite amusements and he had a fine taste in painting prints architecture and gardening With such a fund of knowledge his conversation must have been equally instructive and entertaining but he was also a good man a man of virtue and humanity There is no character without some speck some imperfection and I think the greatest defect in his was an affectation in delicacy or rather effeminacy and a visible fastidiousness or contempt and disdain of his inferiors in science He also had in some degree that weakness which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters and though without birth or fortune or station his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman who read for his amusement Perhaps it may be said What signifies so much knowledge when it produced so little Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few Poems But let it be considered that Mr Gray was to others at least innocently employed to himself certainly beneficially His time passed agreeably he was every day making some new acquisition in science his mind was enlarged his heart softened his virtue strengthened the world and mankind were shewn to him without a mask and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling and unworthy of the attention of a wise man except the pursuit of knowledge and practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us  In addition to this character Mr Mason has remarked that Gray's effeminacy was affected most  before those whom he did not wish to please and that he is unjustly charged with making knowledge his sole reason of preference as he paid his esteem to none whom he did not likewise believe to be good  Dr Johnson makes the following observations  What has occurred to me from the slight inspection of his letters in which my undertaking has engaged me is that his mind had a large grasp that his curiosity was unlimited and his judgment cultivated that he was a man likely to love much where he loved at all but that he was fastidious and hard to please His contempt however is often employed where I hope it will be approved upon scepticism and insidelity His short account of Shaftesbury I will insert  You say you cannot conceive how lord Shastesbury came to be a philosopher in vogue I will tell you first he was a lord secondly he was as vain as any of his readers thirdly men are very prone to believe what they do not understand fourthly they will believe any thing at all provided they are under no obligation to believe it fifthly they love to take a new road even when that road leads no where sixthly he was reckoned a fine writer and seems always to mean more than he said Would you have any more reasons An interval of above forty years has pretty well destroyed the charm A dead lord ranks with commoners vanity is no longer interested in the matter for a new road is become an old one  As a writer he had this peculiarity that he did not write his pieces first rudely and then correct them but laboured every line as it arose in the train of composition and he had a notion not very peculiar that he could not write but at certain times or at happy moments a fantastic foppery to which our kindness for a man of learning and of virtue wishes him to have been superior  As a Poet he stands high in the estimation of the candid and judicious His works are not numerous  but they bear the marks of intense application and careful revision The Elegy in the Churchyard is deemed his masterpiece the subject is interesting the sentiment simple and pathetic and the versification charmingly melodious This beautiful composition has been often selected by orators for the display of their rhetorical talents But as the most finished productions of the human mind have not escaped censure the works of our Author have undergone illiberal comments His Elegy has been supposed defective in want of plan Dr Knox in his Essays has observed  that it is thought by some to be no more than a confused heap of splendid ideas thrown together without order and without proportion  Some passages have been censured by Kelly in the  Babbler  and imitations of different authors have been pointed out by other critics But these imitations cannot be ascertained as there are numberless instances of coincidence of ideas so that it is difficult to say with precision what is or is not a designed or accidental imitation  Gray in his Elegy in the Churchyard has great merit in adverting to the most interesting passions of the human mind yet his genius is not marked alone by the tender sensibility so conspicuous in that elegant piece but there is a sublimity which gives it an equal claim to universal admiration  His Odes on  The Progress of Poetry  and of  The Bard  according to Mr Mason's account  breathe the high spirit of lyric enthusiasm The transitions are sudden and impetuous the language full of fire and force and the imagery carried without impropriety to the most daring height They have been accused of obscurity but the one can be obscure to those only who have not read Pindar and the other only to those who are unacquainted with the history of our own nation  Of his other lyric pieces Mr Wakefield a learned and ingenious commentator observes that though  like all other human productions they are not without their defects yet the spirit of poetry and exquisite charms of the verse are more then a compensation for those defects The Ode on  Eton College  abounds with sentiments natural and consonant to the feelings of humanity exhibited with perspicuity of method and in elegant intelligible and expressive language The Sonnet on  the Death of West  and the Epitaph on Sir  William Williams  are as perfect compositions of the kind as any in our language  Dr Johnson was confessedly a man of great genius but the partial and uncandid mode of criticism he has adopted in his remarks on the writings of Gray has given to liberal minds great and just offence According to Mr Mason's account he has subjected Gray's poetry to the most rigorous examination Declining all consideration of the general plan and conduct of the pieces he has confined himself solely to strictures on words and forms of expression and Mr Mason very pertinently adds that  verbal  criticism is an ordeal which the most perfect composition cannot pass without injury  He has also fallen under Mr Wakefield's severest censure This commentator affirms that  he thinks a refutation of his strictures upon Gray a necessary service to the public without which they might operate with a malignant influence upon the national taste His censure however is too general and expressed with too much vehemence and his remarks betray upon the whole an unreasonable fastidiousness of taste and an unbecoming illiberality of spirit He appears to have turned an unwilling eye upon the beauties of Gray because his jealousy would not suffer him to see such superlative merit in a cotemporary  These remarks of Mr Wakefield appear to be well founded and it has been observed by another writer that Dr Johnson being strongly influenced by his political and religious principles was inclined to treat with  the utmost severity some of the productions of our best writers to which may be imputed that severity with which he censures the lyric performances of Gray It is highly probable that no one poetical reader will universally subscribe to his decisions though all may admire his vast intuitive knowledge and power of discrimination  In the first copy of this exquisite Poem Mr Mason observes the conclusion was different from that which the Author afterwards composed and though his afterthought was unquestionably the best yet there is a pathetic melancholy in the four stanzas that were rejected following "With incense kindled at the Muses' flame" which highly claim preservation  The thoughtless wor'd to Majesty may bow  Exalt the brave and idolize success  But more to innocence their safety owe  Than pow'r or genius e'er conspir'd to bless  And thou who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead  Dust in the  e notes their artless tale relate  By night and lonely contemplation led  To wander in the gloomy walks of fate  Hark how the sacred calm that breathes around  Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease  In still small accents whispering from the ground  A grateful earnest of eternal peace  No more with reason and thyself at strife  Give a  xious cares and endless wishes room  But throu  h the cool sequester'd vale of life  Pursue the silent tenor or thy doom  In one instance the Doctor's inconsistency and deviation from his general character does him honour After having commented with the most rigid severity on the poetical works of Gray as it conscious of the injustice done him he seems to apologize by the following declaration which

uncorrupted with literary  prejudices after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours The  Churchyard  abounds with images which find a mirror in every mind and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo The four stanzas beginning  Yet e'en these bones  are to me original I have never seen the notions in any

THE MEMORY OF MR GRAY  By J T  ON Cham's fair banks where Learning's hallow'd fane  Majestic rises on th' astonish'd sight  Where oft the Muse has led the fav'rite swain  And warm'd his foul with heav'n's inspiring sight  Beneath the covert of the sylvan shade  Where deadly cypress mix'd with mournful yew  Far o'er the vale a gloomy stillness spread  Celestial Genius burst upon the view  The bloom of youth the majesty of years  The soften'd aspect innocent and kind  The sigh of sorrow and the streaming tears  Resistless all their various pow'r combin'd  In her fair hand a silver harp she bore  Whose magic notes soft warbling from the string  Give tranquil joys the breast ne'er knew before  Or raise the soul on rapture's airy wing  By grief impell'd I heard her heave a sigh  While thus the rapid strain resoanded thro' the sky  Haste ye sister pow'rs of Song  Hasten from the shady grove  Where the river ro  along  Sweetly to the voice of love  Where indulging mirthful pleasures  Light you press the flow'ry green  And from Flora's blooming treasures  Call the wreath for Fancy's queen  Where your gentlyflowing numbers  Floating on the fragrant breeze  Sink the soul in pleasing slumbers  On the downy bed    For graver strains prepare the plaintive lyre  That wakes the softest feelings of the soul  Let lonely grief the melting verse inspire  Let deep'ning sorrow's solemn accents roll  Rack'd by the hand of rude Disease  Behold our fav'rite Poet lies  While ev'ry object form'd to please  Far from his couch ungrateful flies  The blissful Muse whose fav'ring smile  So lately warm'd his peaceful breast  Diffusing heav'nly joys the while  In Transport's radiant garments drest  With darksome grandeur and enfeebled blaze  Sinks in the shades to night and shuns his eager gaze  The gaudy train who wait on Spring  Ode on Spring  Ting'd with the pomp of vernal pride  The youth who mount on pleasure's wing  Ode on the Prospect of Eton College  And idly sport on Thames's side  With cool regard their various arts employ  Nor rouse the drooping mind nor give the pause of joy  Ha what forms with port sublime  Bard an Ode  Glide along in sullen mood  Scorning all the threats of time  High above misfortune's flood  They seize their harps they strike the lyre  With rapid hand with freedom's fire  Obedient Nature hears the lofty sound  And Snowdon's airy cliffs the heavenly strains resound  In pomp of  ate behold they wait  With arms outstretch'd and aspects kind  To snatch on high to yonder sky  The child of Fancy left behind  Forgot the woes of Camoria's fatal day  By rapture's blaze impell'd they swell the artless lay  But ah in vain they strive to sooth  With gentle arts the tort'ring hours  Adversity  Ode to Adversity  with rankl  ng tooth  Her baleful gifts profusely pours  Behold she comes the fiend forlorn  Array'd in Horrour's settled gloom  She strews the brier and prickly thorn  And triumphs in th' infernal doom  With frantic fury and insatiate rage  She gnaws the throbbing breast and blasts the gl  g page  No more the soft  olian flute  The Progress of Poetry  Breathes thro' the  eart the melting strain  The pow'rs of Harmony are mute  And leave the oncedelightful plain  With heavy wing I see them beat the air  Damp'd by the Laden hand of com  Despair  Yet stay O stay celestial Pow'rs  And with a hand of kind regard  Dispel the boist'rous storm that lours  Destructive on the fav'rite bard  O watch with me his last expiring breath  And snatch him from the arms of dark oblivious Death  Hark the Fatal Sisters  The Fatal Sisters an Ode  join  And with horrour's mutt'ring sounds  Weave the tissue of his line  Whi  e the dreadful spell resounds  " Hail ye midnight Sisters hail  " Drive the shuttle swift along  " Let our

Tho' once so sweet so lovely to the eye  Thus the tail oaks when boist'rous storms assail  Torn from the earth a mighty ruin lie  Ye sacred Sisters of the plaintive verse  Now let the stream of fond

subject and simile as usual with Pindar are here united The various sources of poetry which gives life and lustre to all it touches are here described as well in its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject otherwise dry and barren with all the pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers as in its more rapid and irresistible course when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions  And give to rapture all thy trembling strings  From Helicon's harmonious springs  A thousand rills their mazy progress take  The laughing flow'rs that round them blow  Drink life

Odin or Woden in the Gothic mythology Their name signifies  chusers of the Slain  They were mounted on swift horses with drawn swords in their hands and in the throng of battle selected such as were

mansionhouse at StokePogeis The performance inducing her to with far the Author' acquaintance Lady Schaub and Miss speed then at her house undertook to introduce her to it These two ladies waited upon the Author at his aunt's solitary habitation where he at that time resided and not finding him at home they left a card behind them Mr Gray surprised at such a compliment returned the visit and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some appearance of romance he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the Long story contains  IN Britain's isle no matter where  An ancient pile of building stands  The mansionhouse at StokePogeis then in the possession of Vifcountess Cobham The style of building which we now call Queen Elizabeth's is here admirably described both with regard to its beauties and defects and the third and fourth stanzas delineate the fantastic manners of her time with equal truth and humour The house formerly belonged to the Earls of Huntingdon and the family of Hatton  The Huntingdons and Hattons there  Employ'd the pow'r of Fairy hands  To raise the ceiling's fretted height  Each pannel in atchievements clothing  Rich windows that exclude the light  And passages that lead to nothing  Full oft within the spacious walls  When he had fifty winters o'er him  My grave LordKeeper  Sir Christopher Hatton promoted by Queen Elizabeth for his graceful person and fine dancingBrawls were a sort of a figuredance then in vogue and probably deemed as elegant as our modern cotillons or still more modern quadrilles  led the brawls  The seal and maces danc'd before him  His bushy beard and shoestrings green  His highcrown'd hat and satin doublet  Mov'd the stout heart of England's queen  Tho' Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it  What in the very first beginning  Shame of the versifying tribe  Your hist'ry whither are you spinning  Can you do nothing but describe  A house there is and that's enough  From whence one fatal morning issues  A brace of warriors  The reader is already apprized who these ladies were the two descriptions are prettily contrasted and nothing can be more happily turned than the compliment to Lady Cobham in the eighth stanza  not in buff  But rustling in their silks and tissues  The first came capàpée from France  Her conq'ring destiny fulfilling  Whom meaner beauties eye askance  And vainly ape her art of killing  The other Amazon kind Heav'n  Had arm'd with spirit wit and satire  But Cobham had the polish giv'n  And tipp'd her arrows with goodnature  To celebrate her eyes her air  Coarse panegyrics would but tease her  Melissa is her  nom de guerre    Alas who would not wish to please her  With bonnet blue and capuchine  And aprons long they hid their armour  And veil'd their weapons bright and keen  In pity to the country farmer  Fame in the shape of Mr P  t  I have been told that this gentleman a neighbour and acquaintance of Mr Gray's in he country was much displeased at the liberty here taken with his name yet surely without any great reason  By this time all the parish know it  Had told that thereabouts there lurk'd  A wicked imp they call a Poet  Who prowl'd the country far and near  Bewitch'd the children of the peasants  Dry'd up the cows and lam'd the deer  And suck'd the eggs and kill the pheasants  My Lady heard their joint petition  Swore by her coronet and ermine  She'd issue out her high commission  To rid the manor of such vermine  The heroines undertook the task  Thro' lanes unknown o'er styles they ventur'd  Rapp'd at the door nor stay'd to ask  But bounce into the parlour enter'd  The trembling family they daunt  They flirt they sing they laugh they tattle  Rummage his mother pinch his aunt  And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle  Each hole and cupboard they explore  Each creek and cranny of his chamber  Run hurry scurry round the floor  And o'er the bed and tester clamber  Into the drawers and china pry  Papers and books a huge imbroglio  Under a teacup he might lie  Or creas'd like dog'sears in a folio  On the first marching of the troops  The Muses hopeless of his pardon  Convey'd him underneath their hoops  To a small closet in the garden  So Rumour says who will believe  But that they lest the door a jar  Where safe and laughing in his sleeve  He heard the distant din of war  Short was his joy he little knew  The pow'r of magic was no fable  Out of the window wisk they flew  But left a spell upon the table  The words too eager to unriddle  The Poet felt a strange disorder  Transparent birdlime form'd the middle  And chains invisible the border  So cunning was the apparatus  The pow'rful pothooks did so move him  That willhe nillhe to the g  eat house  He went as if the devil drove him  Yet on his way no sign of grace  For folks in fear are apt to pray  To Phoebus he preferr'd his case  And begg'd his aid that dreadful day  The godhead would have back'd his quarrel  But with a blush on recollection  Own'd that his quiver and his laurel  'Gainst four such eyes were no protection  The court was sat the culprit there  Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping  The Lady Janes and Joans repair  And from the gallery stand peeping  Such as in silence of the night  Come sweep along some winding entry  Styack  The Housekeeoer  has often seen the sight  Or at the chapeldoor stand sentry  In peaked hoods and mantles tarnish'd  Sour visages enough to scare ye  High dames of honour once that garnish'd  The drawingroom of fierce Queen Mary  The peeress comes the audience stare  And doff their hats with due submission  She curt'sies as she takes her chair  To all the people of condition  The Bard with many an artful fib  Had in imagination fenc'd him  Disprov'd the arguments of Squib  The Steward  And all that Grooms  Groom of the chamber  could urge against him  But soon his rhetoric forsook him  When he the solemn hall had seen  A sudden fit of ague shook him  He stood as mute as poor Macleane  A famous highwayman hanged the week before  Yet something he was heard to mutter  " How in the park beneath an oldtree  " Without design to hurt the butter  " Or any malice to the poultry  " He once or twice had penn'd a sonnet  " Yet hop'd that he might save his bacon  " Numbers would give their oaths upon it  " He ne'er was for a conj'rer taken"  The ghostly prudes with hagged  Hagged  i e  the face of a witch or hag The epithet ha  ard has been sometimes mistaken as conveying the same idea but it means a very different thing viz wild and farouche and is taken from an  reclaimed hawk called an hagard  face  Already had condemn'd the sinner  My Lady rose and with a grace  She smil'd and bid him come to dinner  Here the story finishes the exclamation of the ghosts which follows is characteristic of the Spanish manners of the age when they are suposed to have lived and the stanzas said to be lost may be imagined to contain the remainder of their long winded  " JesuMaria Madam Bridget  " Why what can the Viscountess mean"  Cry'd the square hoods in woeful fidget  " The times are alter'd quite and clean  " Decorum's turn'd to mere civility  " Her air and all her manners shew it  " Commend me to her affability  " Speak to a Commoner and Poet"    Here    stanzas are lost    And so God save our noble king  And guard us from longwinded lubbers  That to eternity would sing  And keep my lady from her rubbers  ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD  THE curfew tolls  Iquilla di lontano  Che paia'l giorno pianger che si muore  Dante Pur at  the knell of parting day  The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea  The ploughman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The moping owl does to the moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtree's shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid  The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep  The breezy call of incensebreathing Morn  The swallow twitt'ring from the strawbuilt shed  The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy housewife ply her ev'ning care  No children run to lisp their sire's return  Or climb his knees the envy'd kiss to share  Oft' did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their furrow oft' the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneaththeir sturdy stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Await alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye Proud impute to these the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to ecstacy the living lyre  But knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze the genial current of the soul  Full many a gem of purest ray serene  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear  Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desert air  Some villageHampden that with dauntless breast  The little tyrant of his fields withstood  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest  Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command  The threats of pain and ruin to despise  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land  And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes  Their lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade thro' slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious Truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous Shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  This part of the Elegy differs from the first copy The following stanza was excluded with the other alterations  Hark how the sacred calm that breathes around  Bids ev'ry fierce tumultuous passion cease  In still small accents whisp'ring from the ground  A grateful earnest of eternal peace  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing trìbute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd Muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to die  For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries  E'en in our ashes  Ch'i veggio nel pensier dolce mio fuoco  Fredda una lingua et due begil occhi chiufi  Rimaner croppo noi pien di saville  Petrarch Son  live their wonted fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead  Dost in those lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely Contemplation led  Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded swain may say  " Oft' have we seen him at the peep of dawn  " Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  " To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  " There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  " That wreathes its old fantastic root so high  " His listless length at noontide would he stretch  " And pore upon the brook that babbles by  " Hard by yon' wood now smiling as in scorn  " Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove  " Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  " Or craz'd with care or cross'd in hopeless love  " One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill  " Along the heath  Mr Gray forgot when he displaced by the preceding stanza his beautiful description of the evening haunt the reference to it which he had here left  Him have we seen the greenwood fide along  While o'er the heath we hy'd our labour done  Of  as the woodlark pip'd her farewell song  With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun  and near his fav'rite tree  " Another came nor yet beside the rill  " Nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he  " The next with dirges due in sad array  " Slow thro' the church waypath we saw him borne  " Approach and read for thou canst read the lay  " Grav'd on the stone beneath yon' aged thorn"  In the early editions the following lines were added but the parenthesis was thougth too long  There scatter'd oft' the earliest of the year  By hands unseen are show'rs of vi'lets found  The

warn'd and fir'd by Muestheus' fate  That to avoid and this to emulate  His vig'rous arm he try'd before he flung  Brac'd all his nerves and ev'ry sinew strung  Then with a tempest's whirl and wary eye  Pursu'd his cast and hurl'd the orb on high  The orb on high tenacious of its course  True to the mighty arm that gave it force  Far overleaps all bound and joys to see  Its ancient lord secure of victory  The theatre's green height and woody wall  Tremble ere it precipitates its fall  The pond'rous mass sinks in the cleaving ground  While vales and woods and echoing hills rebound  As when from AEtna's smoaking summit broke  The eyeless Cyclops heav'd the craggy rock  Where Ocean frets beneath the dashing oar  And parting surges round the vessel roar  'Twas there he aim'd the meditated harm  And scarce Ulysses 'scap'd his giant arm  A tiger's pride the victor bore away  With native spots and artful labour gay  A shining border round the margin roll'd  And calm'd the terrors of his claws in gold  Cambridge  May th  GRAY OF HIMSELF  TOO poor for a bribe and too proud to importune  He had not the method of making a fortune  Could love and could hate so was thought something odd  No very great wit he believ'd in a God  A post or a pension he did not desire  But left church and state to Charles Townshend and Squire  POEMATA  ELEGIAC VERSES Occasioned by the Sight of the Plains
