 THE Capricious Lovers A COMIC OPERA As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By Mr ROBERT LLOYD  The Music composed by Mr RUSH LONDON Printed for R WITHY at the Dunciad in Cornhill W GRIFFIN in FetterLane Mr BECKET in the Strand and Mr DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden Price Eighteenpence  THIS OPERA is entered at  StationersHall  and whoever presumes to print the SONGS or any Part of it will be prosecuted by the PROPRIETORS  THE FOLLOWING COMIC OPERA IS INSCRIBED TO GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  By his sincere Friend and Obliged humble Servant  R LLOYD  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER  THE  Caprices d' Amour ou Ninette a la Cour  written by Mr Favart is the ground work of the following little piece But I believe whoever shall examine both Operas will find that I have been perhaps too wanton in my imitation and departed too widely from the original They may probably wish that I had pilfered more and written less What I have added what I have omitted or what  I have alter'd those who can compare one piece with the other will easily perceive and to those who cannot make the comparison any explanation on that head is altogether unnecessary  When Mr Favart's comedy was first put into my hands I could not but be much pleased with the life and simplicity he had thrown into his performance without descending to that species of humour which the English have very little relish of gross Italian buffoonry This I have chiefly endeavoured to preserve in the following Opera with what success the Public will determine  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Astolpho  Mr Packer  Hobbinol  Mr Yates  Damon  Mr Baddeley  Fabian  Mr Didier  Colin  Mr Vernon  WOMEN  Phoebe  Miss Slack  Lisetta  Mrs Clive  Clara  Miss Wright  Emily  Mrs Scott  SCENE a Country VILLAGE  THE CAPRICIOUS LOVERS  ACT I  SCENE I  A view of a plain intermixed with a number of fruittrees and the cottages of peasants the men and women employed in different occupations before their doors and in the field  PHOEBE  at work  AIR I  WHILE the cool and gentle breeze  Whispers fragrance thro' the trees  Nature walking o'er the scene  Clad in robes of lively green  From the sweetness of the place  Labour wears a chearful face  Sure I taste of joys sincere  Faithful  Colin  ever near  When with ceaseless toil oppress'd  Wearied nature sinks to rest  All my labours to beguile  Love shall wake me with a smile  To you  Colin  I am bethrothed and tomorrow shall be our weddingday let that thought make you chearful Away I prithee love your work calls you remember that the fruit of your toils will soon be bestowed upon me  Colin  Do you bid me leave you then already I have no power I am so happy Will you my dearest grant me one boon before I go  Phoebe  Name it  Colin  Your hand that I may kiss it  Phoebe  Theretake it  Colin  Now I'am alive agen I'll to my labour strait and whilst I pluck the fruit you shall delight me with a song  Colin  gets up into the tree the peasants come round about him with their baskets in the mean time she sings    AIR II  PHOEBE  Of  Colin  's tender love possess'd  My heart is glad my spirits blest  His chearful looks his soul sincere  Shall give the smile and wipe the tear  COLIN  No splendour gilds my homely scene  My stores are few my cottage mean  But  Phoebe  's smile rewards my pain  And  Colin  is a wealthy swain  BOTH  No jealous thought shall stain my breast  No fears alarm no cares molest  Pleas'd with the Swain Nymph my hopes pursue  For He She is kind and I am true  SCENE II  HOBBINOL DAMON  Hob  Go your ways for a pair of fond turtles Ah  Damon  it was just so for all the world when I went a courting to our  Cicely  There was such piping and singing and dancing Ah those were merry dayswell wellbut they are all done and past  Damon  True neighbour true we have had our day let the young ones begin nowthe very thoughts  of their approaching happiness make my old nerves spring agen and I could almost caper for joy  Hob  Body o'me I grow young agen at the sight of them  AIR III  Tho' my features I'm told  Are grown wrinkled and old  Dull wisdom I hate and detest  Not a wrinkle is there  Which is furrow'd by care  And my heart is as light as the best  When I look on my boys  They renew my past joys  Myself in my children I see  While the comforts I find  In the kingdom my mind  Pronounce that my kingdom is free  In the days I was young  Oh I capered and sung  The lasses came flocking apace  But now turn'd of threescore  I can do so no more    Why then let my boy take my place  Of our pleasures we crack  For we still love the smack  And chuckle o'er what we have been  Yet why should we repine  You've had your's I've had mine  And now let our children begin  Damon  What signify the great folk with their lace and their furbelows all is not gold that glistens neighbour many a sound looking sheep is rotten at heartOur pleasures may be as good though not so costly as theirs  Hob  'Twas but last summer  Damon  that our Squire got himself a wife a parlous fine lady and a rich one too Lord it did one good to look upon her she had such a delicate white and red for all the world like our  Kate  's doll yet a body would believe that they came together only to live asunder For Madam lies in one bed Squire lies in another and they are now like the two buckets of our townwell when one comes up t'other goes down and if they happen to meet each other you would think they had never seen one another before If this be the matrimony of your town folks give me the country I say  Damon  I'll warrant it will not be so with our young couple blessings light upon them they think of nothing but the feast and the dance and adod we'll dance at the wedding too  Hob  Dance ah ah don't you remember  Damon  come Lammas 'twill be six and forty years agone when I met  Cicely  at our feast  AIR IV  When the head of poor  Tummas  was broke  By  Roger  who play'd at the wake  And  Kate  was alarmed at the stroke  And wept for poor  Tummas's  sake  When his worship gave noggins of ale  And the liquor was charming and stout  O those were the times to regale  And we footed it rarely about  Then our partners were buxom as does  And we all were as happy as kings  Each lad in his holyday cloaths  And the lasses in all their best things  What merriment all the day long  May the feast of our  Colin  prove such  Odzooks but I'll join in the song  And I'll hobble about with my crutch  Ay it was that very day his worship was made justice of the peace and coram then  Cicely  and I came together for the first timeShe was a tight wench then her cheeks were as fresh as a rose and as red as a Catherine pearthere was your dancing  Damon  when she and I were partners and  Flourish of Horns  Col  Oh neighbours neighbours all our grounds are overrun with horses hounds and huntsmen they force into the vineyardPlague on all sportsmen  they are born to ruin usHere  Roger Tummas  quick make haste the gate stands open shut it fast for if we don't take care they'll ravage all  Phoebe  We must be patient  Colin  it's the prince's hunt  Col  A murrain take all hunts I sayHere are they hunting about every day and all day and their fine sports forsooth must be our ruin Our labour is all in vainthey are coming this way I think get in lads and lasses these roaring fellows are keen sportsmen when they have our wives and daughters in chace  A Huntingpiece behind  Exeunt omnes  SCENE III  Enter  ASTOLPHO  and  FABIAN  Fabian  A country girl Sir and is this the object of your adoration  Astolpho  It is and what is still more extraordinary her wit charms me as much as her beauty  Fabian  A miracle  Astolpho  She is indeed a wonder and I have been told that an old lady whose circumstances obliged her to dwell in retirement has been the protectress of this sweet creature and formed and cultivated her mind by an excellent education leaving her possessed of the most amiable simplicity a native frankness of temper and an agreeable vivacity  Fabian  Does not your highness fear some imputation  Astolpho  What signifies the blood she springs from A handsome woman is naturally born above her condition  Fabian  But the Princess  Emily  Sir her rank and virtue  Astolpho  I confess them Yet my heart spite of myself is on the point of proving faithless to her I doat on this little rural innocent and what is still more extraordinary with but little hopes of success  Fabian  Is she so coy then  Astolpho  My answer here must be still more romantick I adore her and yet which perhaps is the best proof I have never dared to utter my passion  Fabian  But how can you hope to gain her heart without solicitation  Astolpho  For that purpose I have at length retained a female solicitor  Lisetta  whom I have sent to exert all her artifice to win her to the court I have no reliance but upon her skill but here they come let us retire and watch their conversation  SCENE VI  PHOEBE  AIR V  When vapours o'er the meadow die  And morning streaks the purple sky  I wake to love with jocund glee  To think on him who doats on me  With secret pleasure I survey  The frolic birds in amorous play  While fondest cares my heart employ  Which flutters leaps and beats for joy  Enter  LISETTA  You must have a very merry heart pretty nymph to be so chearful in such a low and obscure condition  Phoebe  The obscurity of my condition is the means of my happiness what have I to distrub my tranquillity  Lisetta  Tranquillity Oh melancholy tranquillity is the pleasure of a drone dull and stupid I love active pleasures to go on in a perfect round of delights that whirl one about 'till one's almost giddy with happiness and keep one as busy as a bee Indeed  my dear creature you are most horribly mistaken Your purling streams secret groves and dying swains are mighty pretty things to read of but there is nothing so absurd in nature as preferring the gloom of a country life amongst a parcel of cows sheep and men like brutes to the brilliancy of a court And let me tell you young maiden that face was never made to be buried in a cottage Come come I know something that would make your little heart go pitapat for an exchange You shall have nothing to do but to wish and be satisfied You shall have coaches and horses and jewels and servants  Phoebe  Alas a day who will give me all these fine things  Lisetta  Don't you remember the other day you shewed a gentleman his way out of these woods who comes a hunting here sometimes  Phoebe  Oh that's the civil gentleman who calls himself the prince's friend He has promised to speak a word for us at court and to be sure he'll do us real services for he professes great regard  Lisetta  Regard a fiddlestick for regard such beauty as your's will command love wherever it appears What signifies moping in these desertsonly consider how you will shine in a court  Phoebe  Ah madam I see you laugh at me I am not designed for such fine folks I should be ashamed to shew my face at court  Lisetta  Not you indeed There is no such thing as shame at court You shall flaunt it about in a gilt equipage with tail handsome footmen behind it  dressed in silks and sattins and gold and silver and fringes and laces and flounces with jewels on your fingers and diamonds in your ears and a watch by your side And then your toilette oh your toilette  Phoebe  Toilette What's that  Lisetta  What a pretty Nizi 'tis The ladies treasury from whence in all ages they draw their most lasting charms The throne of art the armory of cupid and the altar of the graces it is there that they triumph over nature and repair the ruins of age by the delicate touches of the pencil  AIR VI  Yes that's a magazine of arms  To triumph over time  Whence beauty borrows half her charms  And always keeps her prime  At that the prude coquette and saint  Industrious sets her face  While powder patch and wash and paint  Repair or give a grace  To arch the brow there lies the brush  The comb to tinge the hair  The Spanish wool to give the blush  The pearl to die them fair  Hence rise the wrinkled old and grey  In freshest beauty strong  As Venus fair as Flora gay  As Hebe ever young  Phoebe  This is past my comprehensionI don't understand itShall I grow handsomer at court  Lisetta  Aye to be sure  Phoebe  I should like it vastly I wish I was there Had I more charms  Colin  perhaps might love me better  Lisetta  Try  Phoebe  I have a good mind and yet I am afraid but see yonder comes the gentleman who belongs to the prince  Lisetta  So so her vanity begins to work apace The fish nibbles I'll leave him to hook it  Exit Lisetta  SCENE V  Enter  ASTOLPHO  Astolpho  Goodmorrow fair maiden what still at your rustic employments Fie fie to bury such charms in the country is treason against beauty  Phoebe  Indeed Sir your language is past my simple understanding A fine gentlewoman was here but now and she talked all riddles to me pray Sir can you explain them She told me that there was a receipt at court to make beauty everlasting and that somebody adores me for my part I can't find what she means  Astolpho  Oh  Phoebe  Phoebe  Bless me Sir you sigh is there any thing gives you pain What is the matter with you  Astolpho  I love you  Phoebe  Phoebe  Is that allAnd so you love me  Astolpho  Most sincerely  Phoebe  I'm glad on't  Astolpho  Indeed  Phoebe  Aye indeed Sir Surely Sir you will not deny the request of her you love  Astolpho  No  Phoebe  no name it and be satisfied  Phoebe  You know Sir they are continually hunting here from morn to night if you have any interest good  Sir speak to the prince that we may be no more troubled with him for my part I can't find out what has possessed them to run over our fields in such a manner for the pleasure of killing a little leveret they'll destroy you forty acres of cornonly see  Astolpho  Be satisfiedyour request is already granted  Phoebe  I thank you Sir with all my heart and above all I beg you will never come here for I don't like to see you  Astolpho  What how's that  Phoebe  I hoped  Phoebe  Hopedpray what Sir  Astolpho  You do not love me then  Phoebe  I not I indeedI love  Colin  Astolpho  Vexation who  Colin  who  Phoebe  A young man in our parish who courts me and has promised me marriage  Astolpho  Consider  Phoebe  do not throw away your affections place them more properly Let me conjure you  Taking hold of her hand  SCENE VI  Enter  COLIN  Colin  Softly softly maister you may not touch my  Phoebe  Astolpho  So here's my worthy rival  Phoebe  putting herself before  Colin    Phoebe  I pray Sir do not hurt him  Astolpho  Be not alarmed pretty maiden I come not here to cause unhappiness He rests secure for me if  Colin  is indeed so dear to you be assured I am his friend  Colin  Plague on the friendship of the fox who comes in such a civil leering way to steal away the chickensIf you must needs pamper yourself with a delicate morsel e'en look for it elsewhere  PHOEBE  AIR VII  Be calm I pray my true love dear  You know not what you're doing  A lord is in our presence here  Affront may prove our ruin  COLIN  How can I e're believe him such  These crafty wiles pursuing  To Ast  My lord you honour me too much    A plague on both your wooing  PHOEBE  Oh  Colin  cease your idle prate  Your folly must undo us  You know not from a man so great  What favour may come to us  COLIN  Believe not what the courtiers swear  They ruin whilst they're civil  To Ast  I thank you Sir for all your care    Such kindness is the devil  ASTOLPHO  to  PHOEBE  I was in hopes my tenderness might have won upon you the happy  Colin  I perceive interests you more may he be the means of compleating your happiness  though I am rewarded with affliction But your will shall be my law adieu remember think upon my love and be assured of every service in my power  Exit  Colin  Thank heaven the coast is clear and all is calm agen  Phoebe  Indeed  Colin  you treated the gentleman much too roughlyHe is a lord and he has promised to carry me to court  Colin  To court and will you go  Phoebe  To be sure why not they say it is a charming place we'll go together love  Colin  Hear me  Phoebe  nothing that's handsome is safe at court his design is to betray you which you don't seem to suspecthe talked to you about love why did you listen to him  Phoebe  Phoebe  What if he did talk about love his love is hopeless and your courtiers are too well bred to offend against good manners  Colin  Yes yes they are such sort of folks to be sureyou have found them so  Phoebe  Why do you suspect me I only give ear to such discourse to laugh at it to laugh with you my dear  Colin  remain secure in that assurance  Colin  O no doubt that is charming and fine but don't I see him at this very moment lurking about and staring upon you as if he'd look you through and through as he is not yet gone about his business go home to your own cottage tomorrow you are to be my wise go along without any more to do I tell you it must be so  Phoebe  I can't  Colin  You must  Phoebe  I won't  Colin  You shall  Phoebe  Mighty well  Colin  I don't deserve this at your hands let me alone  PHOEBE  AIR VIII  Be not so cross and rude  You hurt me  Colin  Oh    My lord is much too good  To see me treated so  His lordship's tender care  Shall keep me free from harm  I'll tell him all I swear    O lud you break my arm  SCENE VII  ASTOLPHO FABIAN  and Attendants  Astolpho  Insolent villian release her this instant  Colin  Let us alone Sir I beseech you 'tis our own affair and you have nothing to do with us  Fabian  Stand off fellow 'tis the prince  Phoebe  The prince you the prince  Astolpho  Yes I endeavoured to conceal my rank that your love might be disinterested But to preserve you I will now use my own authority come    Colin  The princethe devil  Aside  Astolpho  Come  Phoebe  and adorn my court there your beauty shall shine with all it's advantages and partake with the sovereign of the homage of all hearts  Phoebe  Yes Sir I will go with you  To Colin  Henceforth you shall learn to prize me better  Colin  Was ever such perfidy  PHOEBE  AIR IX  Go seek some nymph of humbler lot  To share thy board and deck thy cot  With joy I fly the simple youth  Who holds me light or doubts my truth  Thy breast for low too wanton grown  Shall mourn it's peace and pleasure flown  Nor shall my faith reward a swain  Who doubts my love or thinks me vain  Colin  A plague take the whole sex say I they are as light as chaff and fickle as the wind  AIR X  Thus laughed at jilted and betray'd  I stamp I tear I rave  Capricious light injurious maid  I'll be no more thy slave  I'll rend thy image from my heart  Thy charms no more engage  My soul shall take the juster part  And love shall yield to rage  Exeunt Omnes  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Toilette  PHOEBE  dressing  LISETTA  and  CLARA  LISETTA  A LITTLE more rouge if your ladyship pleases  Phoebe  Ladyship don't laugh at me  Lisetta  One slight touch more  Phoebe  More daubing have done I'll no more on't  AIR XI  Thank you ladies for your care  But I pray you both forbear  Sure I am all o'er scratches  That your curious hands must place  Such odd spots upon my face  With your pencils paint and patches  How I totter in my gait  From a dress of so much weight  With my robe too dangling after  Could my  Colin  now but see  What a thing they've made of me  Oh he'd split his sides with laughter  You have made a strange figure of me indeed at last These things are wondrous awkward to me pray let's have done  Clara  Your diamonds madam  Phoebe  O how they sparklebut there are some flowersPoh they have no smellevery thing is unnatural here Beauty is but a painted sign All is imposture even to the very flowers  Clara  These flowers ma'am are made to please the sight not the smell and in this instance they excel those of nature  AIR XII  The flowers which grace their native beds  Awhile put forth their blushing heads  But e'er the close of parting day  They wither shrink and die away  But these which mimic skill hath made  Nor scorch'd by suns nor kill'd by shade  Shall blush with less inconstant hue  Which art at pleasure can renew  Lisetta  A fan for your ladyship  Phoebe  Dear me what use can I make of this  Lisetta  This is a wonderful instrument It's exercise is various and elegant You shall hear it ma'am  AIR XIII  For various purpose serves the fan  As thus a decent blind  Between the sticks to peep at man  Nor yet betray your mind  Each action has a meaning plain  Resentment's in the snap  A flirt expresses strong disdain  Consent a gentle tap  All passions will the fan disclose  All modes of female art  And to advantage sweetly shews  The hand if not the heart  'Tis folly's scepter first designed  By love's capricious boy  Who knows how lightly all mankind  Are govern'd by a toy  Ah ma'am you'll soon understand the power of this art I am ravish'd with it already What an amiable figure  Clara  What a genteel air  Lisetta  How immensely eleganthorrid creature  Aside  Phoebe  Overhearing  What did you say  Lisetta  Quite in natureyou'll be the object of general adoration  Clara  All the world will feel the force of your charms  Phoebe  Charms are these your charms I hardly know myself and yet after all a peacock a jay or a butterfly is drest ten times finer here are gold and silver and jewels and ribbands of all the colours in the rainbow A great hoop that hides my real figure washes that take away my natural complexion shoes that will cripple me and stays that make me crooked I wish I was in my own cloaths again  AIR XIV  When late a simple rustic lass  I rov'd without constraint  A stream was all my looking glass  And health my only paint  The charms I boast alas how few  I gave to nature's care  As vice ne'er spoilt their native hue  They could not want repair  Lisetta  Your ladyship will excuse me but upon my word your notions are quite antiquated and have not the least relish of the  Bon Ton  Phoebe  Bon Ton  what's that  Lisetta  Every thing in the world ma'am in the polite world at least It is impossible to look or walk or talk without it ma'am  Phoebe  What will you persuade me out of my senses d'ye think to make me believe that I have not  the use of my eyes my tongue or my feet Don't I speak plainly Don't you understand me Don't you call this  speaking  Lisetta  Not quite according to the  bon ton  madam there is no occasion for your speaking plainly it is the worst thing you can do nor for my understanding you nay indeed that's still worse than t'other you should never speak to be understood As to your manner drawl out your words in a faint weak voice as if you did not know how to get them off your tongue Your ladyship  entre nous  speaks too much in the country tone You seem all health and spirits Put a little sickly delicacy into your accents languish with your eyes and totter in your gait and then you'll be quite in the  bon ton  ma'am  Phoebe  How strange and ridiculous surely this place is the region of absurdities  AIR XV  How strange the mode which truth neglects  And rests all beauty in defects  But we by homely nature taught  Tho' rude in speech are plain in thought  Lisetta  Why there again in your singing now Your ladyship has a fine pipe but not a note according to the  bon ton  No Italian expression which is the life and soul of all music the very essence of harmony your singers of taste will run up and down the ladder of sounds from the cellar up to the garret now rumbling along in the grand  Spirituoso  till they make  your ears crack again and then in the  Piano  they expire like a swan to their own melody In our favourite compositions we are not contented with making the sound an echo to the sense but by a happy jumbling of both together create the most exquisite confusion of harmony in the universe Please your ladyship I'll give you a specimen and then if you please I'll attend you to court  AIR XVI  Tho' thunder in thy accents roll  No fear shall shake my daring soul  O tyrant grumble rant and rave  My spirit scorns to be thy slave  But pity lends her soothing aid  Can I forsake my tender maid  O tyrant vain is thy decree  Her mournful looks are death to me  SCENE II  Another apartment in the Palace  FABIAN ASTOLPHO  Astolpho  Yes  Fabian  I do observe nay pity her uneasiness The sensibility of the princess alarms me I know her virtues and am convinced of her affection for me Though from her delicacy she has not hitherto upbraided me I perceive she entertains strong suspicions which you know are but too well grounded  Fabian  Yet those my lord are easily removed  Astolpho  And how  Fabian  Your highness' orders have already done it for what you promised  Phoebe  will be a proof which  Emily  cannot suspect that this amour has nothing real in it When this same  Colin  whom the young madam doats on comes to court his love will be a blind for your's  Astolpho  True I have sent for him but what then pray explain  Fabian  The awkward simplicity of country lovers must make an agreeable contrast with the elegance of court manners an amusement only fit for laughter As such only you designed it for that purpose you brought them hither for entertainment and observation The princess cannot suspect your designs upon  Phoebe  when her own  Colin  is permitted to be with her and you will easily find means to compass your intentions when all suspicions are quieted  Astolpho  But see the princess comesI would avoid her  Exeunt  SCENE III  Enter  EMILY  and  CLARA  Emily  He shuns me  Clara  alas 'tis now beyond a doubt  Clara  Do not torment yourself and create imaginary affliction  AIR XVII  Ourselves too often we deceive  And wrong our judgement to believe  When thinking harshly of the swain  We cheat our hopes and brood on pain  Emily  With the generality of women I confess the heart is not so much affected as their vanity is hurt by the fickleness of their lovers Self love is too often the link which unites their souls but the only interest which sways my bosom is the purest and tenderest affection  Clara  Believe me madam the prince is no stranger to your tendernesshe will return it  Emily  You would comfort me I seeperhaps I am alarmed from too slight a cause However watch their steps if you regard your mistress  EMILY  AIR XVIII  If tyrant love with cruel dart  Transfix the maiden's tender heart  Of easy faith and fond belief  She hugs the dart and aids the thief  Till left her helpless state to mourn  Neglected loving and forlorn  She finds while grief her bosom stings  As well as darts the god has wings  But who is this the prince brings with him Oh 'tis the village nymph he so much doats on I must observe them  Exeunt  SCENE IV  Enter  PHOEBE ASTOLPHO  Astolpho  Well what think you of the court does it delight you  Phoebe  Phoebe  It is the seat of wonders Every thing changes character here the men are quite different I met one who is the lord of the manor in our neigbourhood a very proud gentleman amongst us he carries his head so high and looks so fierce and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look  upon him here he was bowing and scraping and cringing Why are they so complaisant here these great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country Does the court make them so much better No I believe if they do any good here 'tis only to get a right to do something bad elsewhere  Astolpho  I hear you with pleasure Did not the brilliancy and the politeness of court surprize  Phoebe  Oh they were extravagantly polite indeed They paid their compliments with wonderful civility and ran over my person and features in a loud whisper with the most minute observation upon my word she's a mighty pretty tight thing quite an angel for the country what a poor little innocent it is what an air she has what a walk what a voice  Astolpho  Oh that is mere pleasantry they'll be more careful by and by and shew you infinitely more respect They will be eager to invent new diversions for you they will read your wishes in your eyes and I my dear will serve them as a model  SCENE V  Enter  EMILY CLARA  Emily  to  Phoebe  So madam you have made a noble conquest Suffer me I beseech you to pay my homage where the prince pays his  Astolpho  Nay but  Emily  you misunderstand  Emily  to  Phoebe  Your superior charms  Phoebe  Pray madam do not mock me  Emily  to  Astolpho  Don't disturb yourself my lord my presence interrupts I see I will retire  Phoebe  Stay stay we have no secrets to talk of The prince and I  Emily  I understand you madam It were wonderful indeed if charms like your's had not most terrible effects  AIR XIX  I must approve your highness' flame  Your passion for the fair  And all the world must feel the same  Who marks her shape and air  A mien so rich in ev'ry grace  Her manners so polite  Such beauty learning from her face  Was ever such a fright  Phoebe  So then the prince is her lover Yes yes I plainly perceive it Upon my word this place abounds with very odd customs  To Astolpho  Can you divide your heart to two at a time  To Emily  The prince loves me too madam he has sworn it  Emily  ironically to Astolpho  Meer pleasantry that's all  Astolpho  to  Emily  Nay but I assure you  Phoebe  to  Emily  You need not be under any apprehensions on my account For my part I love  Colin  Astolpho  Yes yes  Colin  is her love and  Colin  shall come I told you so  To Emily  Don't give any credit  Emily  I believe nothing  Astolpho  'Twas but a whim that caused all this for I imagined the rustic simplicity of these peasants might make an agreeable contrast with the refined manners of our courtiers  Emily  Forcing a laugh  A very ridiculous project truly Oh we shall be charmingly amused Come let us hear some of her prattleWell my dear and how do you like the court  Phoebe  May I speak my lord  Astolpho  Oh what you please  Phoebe  Then if I must fairly confess the truth I am heartily tired of this horrid place where every object I perceive seems a contradiction to common sense Their whole design is to reverse nature where people are for ever busy in doing nothing where they eat without appetite and lie down without rest where  their mirth is all grimace and their pleasure nothing but perpetual noise  Clara  Her observation madam to me seems perfectly just groves and retirement are your only places for innocence and simplicity  AIR XX  Along your verdant lowly vale  Calm Zephyr breathes a gentle gale  But rustling thro' the lofty trees  It swells beyond the peaceful breeze  Thus free from envy's poison'd dart  You boast a pure unruffled heart  While jarring thoughts our peace deform  And swell our passions to a storm  Emily  And pray when is she to return to her village again is she to go tomorrow  Phoebe  No Sir to night to night I beseech you the sooner the better  Emily  Come come then let us leave her to prepare for her journey and indulge her meditation on her beloved  Colin  Your servant my dear  Astolpho  Adieu  Phoebe  don't be uneasy your  Colin  will soon be here  Astolpho and Emily out  Phoebe  Your servant my dear a mighty pretty subject to laugh at truly E'en keep your prince to  yourself I want none of him I am sure I did not come here to look for him  weeping  I have nothing to reproach myself with only let them suffer me to go and I shall be happy Is it my fault what have I to do with it If  Colin  was to treat me so instead of making myself so pleasant with other folks I should die for griefBut what is this I hear ah 'tis  Colin  how engaging he'll find me let me see if he will recollect me in this dress  COLIN  AIR XXI  Plague take such folks  Their whims their jokes  With their nonsense rant and riot  This calls me clown  That shoves me down  Can a body ne'er be quiet  So push'd about  Thrust in thrust out  In a tumult noise and hurry  I'm squeez'd to death  I've lost my breath  And my wits run hurry scurry  Here have they dragged me out of the country to make a fool and laughing stock of me A parcel of servants I think they called them though I took  them for lords they were all so belac'd and beruffled have put me into this dress forsooth in spite of my teeth and what have I to do with these taudry trappings I want nothing in this world but mine own sweetheart  Phoebe  They came truly to fetch me hither and yet I can't find her a plague upon 'em every thing distracts me I know not whether I stand on my head or my legs  Phoebe  I'll e'en go and accost himSir Sir  Colin  Lud lud what can this fine lady want with me  Phoebe  This is the luckiest accident in the world he can never find me out through this disguise  Colin  How she surveys me I believe she'll look me through and through  Phoebe  I'll e'en try his constancy and pray Sir what occasion can have brought you to court  Colin  Me I only come to look for our  Phoebe  Phoebe  Who Sir  Phoebe  Colin  Yes a tight lass of our parish who has promis'd to be my wife but she has left me in the lurch  Phoebe  You amaze me that's scarce possible  Colin  Aye forsooth but it's true  Phoebe  But after all Sir why should that give you any manner of uneasiness a person of your figure I am sure has it always in his power to make a better choice you was never made to be treated with disdain I tell you so Sir as a friend  Colin  Friend a friend to me madam Lord I never saw you before in my life  Phoebe  Upon my word Sir I wish you well  Colin  What without knowing me  Phoebe  Oh Sir people of your sort are easily known you have a certain air in your countenance an appearance in your dress  Colin  Oh madam upon my word  Phoebe  Which sufficiently explain themselves to my eyes  Colin  O as to that your ladyship  Phoebe  And then what is still more distinguishing your excessive politeness  Colin  Politeness I polite indeed madam I don't pretend to know any thing of that matter To be sure I was always counted a civil body and I know how to keep my distance and doff my hat for I know that's good manners for certain when one talks to a great lady  Phoebe  But you Sir are a gentleman  Colin  A gentleman I a gentleman O lud O lud  Phoebe  I see it plainly but you are infinitely too modest you are indeed  Colin  Yes yes forsooth I am a country gentleman  Phoebe  And that Sir is all in all that is a sufficient recommendation and demands a peculiar protection  Colin  Aside  Odsbud but I believe this lady has taken a fancy to me They had good reason indeed who told me one need but shew one's face at court to make one's fortune  Phoebe  Bless me what a charming figure what ease what elegance Oh Sir if you come hither to make your fortune you cannot fail of success Come come you shall be my servant O heavens what ails me I am so dizzy I can hardly stand lord how my heart flutters  Colin  O madam madam shall I assist you  Phoebe  No Sir I thank you by no means I begin to recover I feel myself grow better apace Oh the sweet sweet gentleman  Colin  Indeed madam you frighten me what would you have me do pray speak madam  Phoebe  You mustO Sir spare my blushes lord how I trembleYou must love me a littlecan you will you if you do your fortune is made  Colin  This can be no trick It grieves me to see her in such a taking I'll e'en pretend to fall in love with her Adad I must have more about me than I dreamt of to make such quick impressions on ladies of such high fashion  Phoebe  Aside  So so he begins to waver Let me see how far he will carry itwell Sir and will you agree to my propasalgive me your hand  Colin  Oh madam II dare not  Phoebe  Am I so frightful thencome come  Colin  There thenI never was hardhearted in all my days  Phoebe  discovering herself  Oh traitor have I caught youthis is no more than I expected now look upon me Is it thus you reward your  Phoebe  Colin  Phoebe  who  Phoebe  Phoebe  Yes it is  Phoebe  I have found you now  Colin  A plague upon it who would have dreamt of this  DUETT  Phoebe  See traytor now before thy face  Thy falshood stands confest  Colin  O maiden think me not so base  I feign'd it I protest  Phoebe  Go go deceitful swain  Colin  Say not these words again  Phoebe  Thy guilt is now too true  Colin  Such words are death from you  Phoebe  No better are thy due  Colin  Yes Better are my due  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Street  HOBBINOL DAMON  Damon  AYE aye neighbour your fine folk for all their vapouring and bouncing are no honester than they should be Who would have thought that our  Phoebe  would have been sent for to court  Hob  Sent for quoth a no  Damon  trepanned drawn in by artificeLord what a parcel of nonsense of teeth and lips and ivory and coral and diamonds did some of those scented puppets pour out before the wenches in our village till the maids grew so fantastic that they did not know their heads from their tails  Damon  Fair words cover foul dealings give me plain speech and plain manners I say  Hob  By my troth Gaffer I never could abide these legmaking gentry who bow and scrape and palaver with their hats stuck like gizards under their arms and all the while they mean no more by their  civility than to cuckold the husband or debauch the daughter  Damon  Thank Heav'n  Hobbinol  we have none of those vices we are not so polite  Hobbinol  In good truth neighbour I envy none of those sort of folk  AIR XXII  Tho' my dress as my manners is simple and plain  A rascal I hate and a knave I disdain  My dealings are just and my conscience is clear  And I'm richer than those who have thousands a year  Tho' bent down with age and for sporting uncouth  I feel no remorse from the follies of youth  I still tell my tale and rejoice in my song  And my boys think my life not a moment too long  Let the courtiers those dealers in grin and grimace  Creep under dance over for title or place  Above all the titles that flow from a throne  That of honest I prize and that title's my own  But sure they cannot mean mischief to our young couple since my boy  Colin  has been sent for to court with all haste and to meet your  Phoebe  they said Body O me how their eyes will sparkle when they meet each other I'll warrant you now she is as melancholly as a turtle that has lost it's mate  Damon  But for my part  Hobbinol  I cannot abide the thoughts of her being at court why the place is for all the world like a fair full of nonsense noise and shew  Hob  Aye neighbour they keep fair here all the year round and a plentiful market too only the goods now and then are a little stale  Damon  A plague take their town manners I say Though I dost my hat never so low and bespeak them never so civilly they do but laugh in my face Adod I think we been as proper folks as the best of them in our time They mun keep their flaunts and fleers to themselves It is a wonderment to me neighbour how we found our way hither  Hob  Or how we escaped whole from so many dangers I thought I should have had my body squeezed to death by one of those Iggetting fellows with poles in his hand and a chair at his backside who thrust me into the kennel almost under the wheel of a coach and then surlily cry'd out "by your leave" Had I known that had been the way of asking a civil question ecod but I would have had my crutch ready to have given him an answer  Damon  Well well these disasters are at an end now  Hob  True Gaffer true we mun not bide here we must try what we can to recover our children and for my part I do think  Colin  will be perfect mad if he misses his dear Phoebe  Exeunt  SCENE II  A dressing room in the Palace  PHOEBE LISETTA  AIR XXIII  From flow'r to flow'r the butterfly  O'er fields or gardens ranging  Sips sweets from each and flutters by  And all his life is changing  Thus roving man new objects sway  By various charms delighted  While she who pleases most to day  Tomorrow shall be slighted  Faithless faithless  Colin  And pray madam does  Colin  know the prince designs this visit to me  Lisetta  O yes he is informed of itlong since poor soul  Phoebe  The news of it has affected him no doubt  Lisetta  Oh yes madam for a quarter of an hour or so Now he'd run up and down stamping and tearing and raving and rending like a madman then he'd stop short of a sudden and folding his arms like a lover despairing beside a clear stream heave a desperate sigh with the most rueful length of face mortal ever beheld The Knight of the woeful countenance was a cherub in comparison  AIR XXIV  Oh 'twould pierce a heart of stone  To hear him roar and blubber  So great a lover ne'er was known    Nor e'er so great a lubber  Like little master left alone  By gay mamma forsaken  With hiccup sob and sigh and groan  His heart is almost breaking  But like the rest of his sex sorrow took no fast hold of him 'twas but an April shower and all was fair again  Phoebe  Indeed  Lisetta  were it not for his treachery I could almost find in my heart to pity him But dear  Lisetta  I find myself strangely fatigued your pleasures here pall the mind without entertaining it my spirits are quite overpower'd  Lisetta  I'm glad of it now now you begin to have the  bon ton  I was sure your ladyship could not be so long amongst the polite world without catching the manners of it 'Tis nothing but nerves weak nerves and fashionable vapours things of course  Phoebe  Vapours and weak nerves why can it be a fashion to be sick  Lisetta  O lord as I told you before it's downright ungenteel to be otherwise Your ruddy complexions and active limbs may do very well for a dairy maid  in the country but here they are perfectly unnecessary nay absolutely improper Lard ma'm it is as unfashionable for a fine lady to be without a complaint as 'tis to be out of debt  Phoebe  The more I observe your manners here the more they surprize meBut were it not possible madam that  Colin  might be concealed some where hereabouts that he may overhear our intercourse  Lisetta  Undoubtedly madam but for what purpose does your ladyship intend  Phoebe  The dearest in the world revenge  Lisetta  That is indeed a most delicious morsel and the injustice he has done you by his suspicions deserves the worst of mortifications from your hands  Phoebe  Well  Lisetta  I leave that management to you The prince will be delighted with it Adieu I shall attend his highness's pleasure  Exit Lisetta  If  Colin  blames me now 'tis not without reason but I will still surprize him more Alas why did I come hither Is it the air I breathe which poisons all my peace at home my only thought was mirth for there all was tranquillity pleasure and happiness  AIR XXV  When far from fashion's gilded scene  I breath'd my native air  My thoughts were calm my mind serene  No doubtings harboured there  But now no more myself I find  Distraction rends my breast  While hopes and fears disturb my mind  And murder all my rest  Enter  EMILY CLARA  Emily  So  Clara  I still find her here you see The so much boasted charms of the country will I fear lose all their relish after the splendour of a court  Clara  Love madam is undoubtedly very intoxicating and it is no wonder if the addresses of a prince turn the brain of an ignorant village lass  AIR XXVI  Flattering hopes the mind deceiving  Easy faith too often cheat  Woman fond and all believing  Loves and hugs the dear deceit  Noisy shew of pomp and riches  Cupid's trick to catch the fair  Lowly maids too oft bewitches  Flattery is the beauty's snare  Emily  to  Phoebe  So then you will not leave us yet The court has stronger attractions than you were aware of  Phoebe  Phoebe  Alas madam did it depend upon my choice I would be far off The pleasures of this place are lost upon me they are too artificial for us simple folks who are the servants of nature  Emily  Quit then as fast as you can a place so contrary to your manners I would not delay a moment Alas why cannot I shake off this troublesome pomp and pageantry of courts  AIR XXVII  What's all the pomp of gaudy courts  But vain delights and tinsel toys  While pleasure crowns your rural sports  With calm content and tranquil joys  Clara  O lard madam how pretty must it be to wander along by the flowery banks of murmuring rivers and to breath the delightful fragrance of the meadows Oh 'tis a paradise on earth  AIR XXVIII  Return sweet lass to flocks and swains  Where simple nature mildly reigns  Where love is every shepherd's care  And every nymph is kind as fair  The court has only tinsel toys  Insipid mirth and idle noise  But rural joys are ever new  While nymphs are kind and shepherds true  Phoebe  Upon my word ladies you reason excellently well in your turn I perceive the advice of every body flows from selfinterested motives You would most obligingly inform me that my presence displeases you madam I heartily believe itBut now I  think on it I can't go yet 'tis absolutely impossible I have a particular engagement with the prince  Emily  With the prince  Phoebe  Yes with the prince Oh you will laugh exceedingly  Emily  Laugh I laugh how  Phoebe  The prince you know is in love with you  Emily  sighs  And what then  Phoebe  Thenwhy he desires an interview with me  Emily  Which you have granted I suppose  Phoebe  Oh doubtless It is not for folks in such an humble situation as mine to refuse so great an honour and indeed after so many instances of friendship and protection it were a sin to deny so small a request But I see madam you are discomposed  Emily  Who I not I not in the least  Phoebe  I can't abide to be thought ungrateful  Emily  So then  Phoebe  after all this parade of honour and virtue and love you can make an assignation  Phoebe  Come come don't be suspicious where you dread a rival you may find a friend I pity your uneasiness madam nor will I ever be the cause of adding to it Come then with me and if possible endeavour to forget your jealous resentment I warrant you all will be well yet  Exeunt  SCENE IV  An Antichamber  Enter  COLIN  AIR XXIX  Oh booby blockhead numpskul ass  Oh fatal strange mistake  I fear I've lost my dearest lass  Oh sure my heart will break  Where shall I now my  Phoebe  find  Oh lovely cruel fair  And will she then be still unkind  I tremble I despair  I'm ruined dead undone They have bewitched her they have poisoned her they have given her something to steal away her heart and yet I scarce can credit itIt is impossible what  Phoebe  meet the prince alone alas it is but too true My folly has aggravated her to an entire neglect of me Well Heaven be thanked I am not quite friendless yet The goodnatured gentlewoman who brought me hither has promised to place me where I may overhear all and if I find my suspicions true I know how to be revenged for the trick she has played me Yes I will give vent to my anger yes thou cruel hardhearted  Phoebe  I'll tell you to your face that you are a false ungrateful  hussey and thenI'll go and hang myself and then you shall never see me moreBut yonder's the fine lady my friend and guideLord Lord how my heart beats how I dread the event  Exit  SCENE V  An apartment in the Palace  Enter  PHOEBE  So thenhitherto all things are rightly disposed  Colin  now may be satisfied of our interview how strangely am I situated at once the object of the prince's love which I never was ambitious of of the princess's jealousy whom I wish to serve and my own  Colin  's hard suspicions which are most unjust but here comes the prince  Enter  ASTOLPHO  Well my Lord you find me an obedient servant what would your highness have with me  Astolpho  Can that be a question now  Phoebe  does not the tenor of my whole behaviour explain itself to you Come come you know I love you  Phoebe  Love me alas my lord I was born to humbler hopes and your highness can never be at a loss for more worthy objects  Astolpho  WorthierSurely  Phoebe  you take a pleasure in creating my misery  Phoebe  No I would rather wish to make you happy  Astolpho  Alas I have wish'd I have sighed a long time for a heart without guile a heart that was simple and ingenuous a happiness not to be met with at court  Phoebe  Oh my lord that is a happiness you have always in your own power  Astolpho  My power do you approve my passion then am I so blest  Phoebe  Indeed I will not hesitate one moment to make you so Wait but my return and I will convince you  Exit  Astolpho  What can this mean I am astonished my spirits are all in arms and my heart flutters with expectation  Phoebe returns with Emily  Phoebe  There my lord  presenting Emily  that happiness is now your own and I feel a satisfaction in being the means of it  Exit  Enter  COLIN  from behind  AIR XXX  Confusion tortures death despair  Why am I thus betrayed  Thy vows I whistle to the air  Go perjured treacherous maid  Emily looks at Colin and enter Phoebe on the other side  I see my fault I blush for shame  Oh joy to find thee true  Oh nymph forbear that fault to blame  Which rose from love to you  Phoebe  to  Astolpho  Now Sir you are master of that treasure you so long desired be happy in the possession of it And now  Colin  what is become of your jealousy take care how you harbour again a fiend which destroys all peace  Colin  I begin to revive again  Emily  to  Astolpho  Assured as I am of your inconstancy I might perhaps break out into reproaches but your conduct afflicts me more than it offends and makes me unhappy without being violent I see Sir I have lost your heart  going  Astolpho  stopping her  Stay stay my princess our hearts were not designed for such separation  Phoebe  it is true by thus enlightning my bewildered senses has  humbled me sufficiently and I should blush indeed if I did not endeavour to imitate her Her example shall excite me and if my revived affections are worthy of a return Hymen shall unite us on this day  Emily  Love surely may excuse its own frailties Oh  Phoebe  let me embrace thee how much do I owe to your friendshiphow shall I reward you  Phoebe  Leave that to  Colin  madam for from him alone I expect it Come  Colin  endeavour to amend your errors here take my hand now you know all my vengeance  AIR XXXI  Again in rustic weeds array'd  A simple swain a simple maid  O'er rural scenes with joy we'll rove  By dimpling brook or cooling grove  Thy hands shall pluck to grace my bow'r  The luscious fruit the fragrant flow'r  Whilst joys shall bless for ever new  Thy  Phoebe  kind my  Colin  true  Colin  Nor shalt thou be deceivedlet us away with haste We will be married strait this is true joy indeed what need of so much mystery to be happy but however Sir I pray you leave off your hunting on our grounds Peace and quietness are better than all the honours in the world  AIR XXXII  Why should I now my love complain  That toil awaits thy chearful swain  Since labour oft a sweet bestows  Which lazy splendour never knows  Hence springs the purple tide of health  The rich man's wish the poor man's wealth  And spreads those blushes o'er the face  Which come and go with native grace  The pride of dress the pomp of shew  Are trappings oft to cover woe  But we whose wishes never roam  Shall taste of real joys at home  Astolpho  May heav'n protect you both live long in peace and happiness and share my bounties as you please  Enter  FABIAN  Here are two old men come after  Colin  and  Phoebe  they make such a bustle and clamour one would think they were stark staring mad  Astolpho  Oh bring them in the happiness will now be general indeed  To Emily  what uneasiness has my folly produced But  Damon  without  I tell you I will have my daughter  HOBBINOL  without  Give me my son I say body o'me you smock fac'd chitterling Oh that I was but threescore for your sake  Damon  Don't talk to me my own's my own and I will come in  Phoebe  Good heavens my father  Enter  HOBBINOL  and  DAMON  Damon  So so we have found you nowAdod but we have not They do nothing but make fools of us I think  Hob  For my part I believe it is the land of lies I did not want such fine folks our search is after a couple of stray'd children and they told us they were here  Going up to Colin  I pray you Sir can you tell me any tidings  discovering him  Ods my life its my own boy  Colin  I am transported I am overjoyed and why did not you answer your father you dog Only see  Damon  how they have bedizened him a looks for all the world like a king in the puppetshew  Phoebe  to  Damon  And here too is your  Phoebe  Sir It is no wonder you should not discover me through this disguise since even the quick sighted eyes of a lover have been deceived before now  Damon  Have I recovered thee at last my child My neighbour and I have had a wearisome pursuit after thee  Colin  All is well that ends well father we shall now be as happy as the day is long thanks to the prince there In truth we are much obliged to him  Hob  Oblig'd quoth a yes yes I suppose he has been very obliging  AIR XXXIII  No doubt but your foolscap has known  His highness obligingly kind    Odzooks I could knock the fool down  Was e'er such a couckoldy kind  To be sure like a good naturedspouse  You've lent him a part of your bed  He has fitted the horns to your brows  And I see them sprout out of your head  To keep your wise virtuous and chaste  The court is a wonderful school    My lord you've an excellent taste    And son you are a cuckoldy fool  If your lady should bring you an heir  The blood will flow rich in his veins  Many thanks to my lord for his care    You dog I could knock out your brains  DUETT  Colin  I scorn to be any man's slave  I know what is proper and right  Hob  You talk Sir exceedingly brave  You puppy get out of my sight  Colin  Dear father ne'er trust to report  My  Phoebe  is true to her swain  Hob  Then why this fine jaunt up to court  You dupe you're a cuckold in grain  Astolpho  Be not so distrustful old friend I have seen my error and repent it The temporary uneasiness you have found in the loss of your children will be amply compensated in the happiness of today Here  taking Emily by the hand  my affections are settled  Phoebe  merits no suspicions and if mutual love happily rewarded can ensure a blessing upon earth her union today with  Colin  shall effect it Come come we shall all be happy  Emily  to  Hobbinol  You may be perfectly satisfied Sir your fears are all groundless It is from the conviction of her innocence and by her interposition that all parties are reconciled Surely you ought to be satisfied on this point when you see I am  Hob  Say you so why then come hither children Heav'n bless youBody o'me but I cry for joy  Damon  Let me join my blessing too And now adod I'm as gay as a lark and as light as a cork  Astolpho  From this hour my bliss commences How sweet it is to gain the affections of a heart which owes all its charms to innocence and simplicity but to find one without guile in the midst of courts whose honesty of nature is not corrupted though it is cultivated by art makes up my peculiar felicity  TRIO  Colin  For thee my love shall ever burn  Thou art my fondest aim  Phoebe  My love shall yield thee sweet return  I burn with equal flame  Emily  No care shall e'er my soul annoy  No fears my bliss destroy  Colin  For thee my love shall burn  Phoebe  My love shall yield return  Emily  Love is our whole employ  All  Oh this is perfect joy  FINIS
