 THE FUNERAL OF ARABERT MONK OF LA TRAPPE BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON BOOKSELLER AT THE FEATHERS NEW BOND STREET  MDCCLXXI  ADVERTISEMENT  ARABERT a young ecclesiastic retired to the convent of  La Trappe  in obedience to a vow he had taken during a fit of illness LEONORA with whom he had lived in the strictest intimacy followed her lover and by the means of a disguise obtained admission into the monastery where a few days after she assisted at her lover's funeral  THE FUNERAL  c  FAIR LEONORA by affliction led  Sought the dread dome where sleep the hallow'd dead  The solemn edifice was wrapt around  In midnight darkness and in peace profound  A solitary lamp with languid light  Serv'd not to chase but to disclose the night  Serv'd to disclose of all her grief the source  The tomb that gap'd for ARABERTUS' corse  To this she sent the deep the frequent sigh  And spokethe tear just gath'ring in her eye  'Doom'd to receive all that my soul holds dear  'Give him that rest his heart refus'd him here  'Oh screen him from the pain the tender know  'The train of sorrows that from passion flow  'And to his envied newborn state adjoin  'Or all is vain an ignorance of mine'  As thus she mourn'd an aged priest drew near  Whose pure life glided as the riv'let clear  The virtuous ANSELMTho' in cloisters bred  Still brightey'd Wisdom to his cell he led  From paths of sophistry he lov'd to stray  To tread the walk where Nature led the way  The prior's rank he long had held approv'd  Esteem'd rever'd and as a parent lov'd  Unskilful in the jargon of the schools  He knew humanity's diviner rules  To others gentle to himself severe  On sorrow's wound he dropt the healing tear  In all the negligence of grief he found  The fair extended on the naked ground  Touch'd at her woe the sacred father said  'Well may'st thou droop if happiness be fled  'Sure if at holy ARABERT'S decease  'Impetuous sorrows rush upon thy peace  'Some muchlov'd friend in him you must deplore  'Or dearer still a brother is no more  'Yet as thro' life our weary steps we bend  'Let us not sink when beating storms descend  'Still let Religion hold unrival'd sway  'And Patience walk companion of our way  'Ah lose not sight of that delightful shore  'Whose blissful bow'rs shall friends to friends restore  'Tho' here misfortune comes to blast our will  'The Heav'ns are just and God a Father still  'Blest be the voice the rising mourner said  'That bids Affliction raise her drooping head  'That bids me hope beyond ev'n Death's domain  'These eyes shall banquet on my love again  'Ah start not ANSELMfor to truth allied  'Impiety now throws her mask aside  'No holy monk by contemplation led  'To these sequestered mansions of the dead  'No youth devoted to Religion's pow'r  'Implores thy pity at this awful hour  'The guilty secretI'll at length unfold  'In meforgive a woman you behold  'Ah fly me not let mercy now prevail  'And deign to mark my sad disastrous tale'  'Known to misfortune from my tender years  'My parent's ashes drank my early tears  'A barb'rous uncle to each vice allied  'The office of a parent ill supplied  'Of my entire inheritance possess'd  'By lucre prompted and by fortune blest  'He pass'd the ocean never to return  'And left me weeping o'er my parents' urn  'Then ARABERT the gen'rous stranger came  'To sooth my sorrows and relieve my shame  'Beneath his tender care my woes decreas'd  'More than Religion's he was Pity's priest  'To reach his bounty my affection strove  'Till gratitude was heighten'd into love  'Nor he at length refus'd the lover's part  'The pity that adorn'd betray'd his heart  'How ardently he wish'd the nuptial rite  'In holy wedlock might our hands unite  'But stern Religion at our vows exclaim'd  'And tore the bands that Love and Nature fram'd  'For then devoted to her hallow'd shrine  'His country's laws forbad him to be mine  'Tho' from my mind each flatt'ring thought retir'd  'And in my bosom hope and peace expir'd  'Yet on their ruins love triumphant rose  'Enoughshame o'er the rest a mantle throws  'At length Remorse effaced the guilty scene  'And to his breast apply'd her dagger keen  'Restrain'd in full career the erring youth  'And led him back to Innocence and Truth  ' 'Twas then he fled from Pleasure's rosy bow'rs  'To woo Religion in these gloomy tow'rs  'Yet are he fled my bliss he fondly plann'd  'And scatter'd riches with a lavish hand  'Ah what to me avail'd the golden store  'The giver gone the gift cou'd charm no more  'While in the gloom his tedious absence cast  'My former life in fancy I repass'd  'Repentance gain'd admission to my breast  'Nor did it enter an unwelcome guest  'For ne'er to Pleasure I dismiss'd the rein  'Free and unconscious of reflection's pain  'If hapless LEONORA lov'd too well  'Content fair Virtue's friend with Virtue fell  'But not my stubborn soul cou'd pray'r subdue  'Ev'n grafted on remorse my passion grew  'Too fatal passionby its impulse led  'In man's attire to this retreat I fled  'Yet then ev'n then to bashful fear allied  'Still o'er my love did modesty preside  'In those sweet moments that precede the night  'When peaceful Nature wears a soften'd light  'I met the youth within the solemn grove  'His frequent walk absorb'd in heav'nly love  'I strove to speak but words refus'd to flow  'And fix'd I stood a monument of woe  'While God and he employ the trembling scene  ' 'Twere sacrilege I thought to rush between  'Still from that hour my wishes I restrain'd  'And in my breast th' unwilling secret chain'd  'Unknown to him yet halfcontent I grew  'So that his form might daily charm my view  'Think how misguided by your guileless heart  'You took for virtue what in me was art  'And highly honor'd with applauding strain  'The zeal that join'd Religion's sober strain  'Unknowing that the call thou did'st approve  'And all my virtue all my zeal was love  'But new Affiction with relentless hand  'O'erthrew the project that my heart had plann'd  'Amid the horrors of the lonesome night  'A ghastly spectre rush'd upon my sight  'And pour'd these accents on my trembling ear'  Think not impiety shall triumph here    Thy hopes are blastedDeath's tremendous bell  Shall sound ere many hours thy lover's knell  'I started from my couch with fright impress'd  'And anxious doubts were busy in my breast  'By love then promptedyet by love dismay'd  'The peopled choir I tremblingly survey'd  'Still mid th' innumerous monastic train  'These eyes solicited his form in vain  'Nor in the field or pensive grove retir'd  'Could I discover whom my heart requir'd  'Then sure I cried at this unhappy hour  'Does anguish o'er his cell diffuse its pow'r  'Shall LEONORA not relieve his pain  'And with these arms his drooping head fustain  'Say at the couch when death is stalking round  'Shall not the spouse of his fond heart be found  'Ah noth' affection that subdues me still  'At that dread moment check'd my ardent will  'Lest rushing on his sight I should control  'The holy thoughts that hover'd o'er his soul  'This low'ring morn disclos'd the fatal truth  'Oh early lostoh lov'doh hapless youth  'Fix'd to the column of the hallow'd porch  ' 'Twas scarcely lightsome fury lent her torch  'I read  The pious  ARABERT'  s no more  The peace the dead require for him implore  'Let peace let joy I said his spirit join  'Nor joy nor peace must e'er encircle mine  'Lamented youth too tenderly allied  'In vain you fled me and in vain you died  'Still to your image which this breast inurns  'My constant heart a lamp perpetual burns  'But thou to whom as friend he did impart  'Each latent wish and foible of the heart  'For well I know where Sorrow drops her tear  'Or Misery complains thou still art near  'Ah say by love did my idea drest  'Come to his mind thus welcome thus carest  'Or on his soul come rushing undesir'd  'The fatal fair by female arts inspir'd  'Who dimm'd the lustre of his radiant name  'And from his temples tore the flow'r of fame  'Who thro' the labyrinth of Pleasure's bow'r  'Allur'd for beauty such as mine had pow'r  'Ev'n to the dang'rous fteepand cast him down  'From high repute to grov'ling disrenown  'Wretch that I am to my distressful state  'There wanted not th' addition of his hate  'For him I plung'd my artless youth in shame  'Unlock'd reserve and sacrificed my fame  'Still still I fear unable to confide  'Before my ARABERT the lover died  'This thought to thee I'll own suspends my grief  'While cold indifference c mes to my relief  'Say virtuous ANSELM if this thought be vain  'And give Oh give me all my grief again  To her replied the pitybreathing seer  'Mark well my words and lose thy idle fear  'When on the couch of Death the victim lay  'Not in that moment was his friend away  'As at his side I took my mournful stand  'With feeble grasp he seiz'd my offer'd hand  'And thus began"The fatal dart is sped  "Soon soon shall ARABERT encrease the dead  " 'Tis wellfor what can added life bestow  "But days returning still with added woe  "Say have I not secluded from my sight  "The lovely object of my past delight  "Ah had I too dethron'd her from my mind  "When here the holy brotherhood I join'd  "Remorse wou'd not encreafing my disease  "Prey on my soul and rob it of its ease  "And yet I strove unequal to the part  "Weak to perform the sacrifice of heart  "And now ev'n now too feeble to control  "I feel her clinging to my parting soul"  "He spokemy sympathetic bosom bled  "And to the realms of Death his spirit fled  The fair rejoin'd 'Misled by foul distrust  'To him whose heart was mine am I unjust  'Ah ARABERT th' unwilling fault forgive  'Dead to th'alluring world in thee I live  'My thoughts my deep regret my sorrows own  'No view no object still but thee alone  'At all the vengeance bursting from above  'Alarm'd I weep I shudder yet I love'  As thus she spoke the deathbell smote her ear  While to the porch the fun'ral train drew near  Ah LEONORE in that tremendous hour  Did'st thou not feel all Heav'n's avenging pow'r  When moving thro' the isle the choral band  And vested priests with torches in their hand  Gave to thy view unfortunately dear  Thy lover sleeping on th' untimely bier  Collecting now at length her scatter'd force  With trembling footsteps she approach'd the corse  And while she check'd the conflict in her breast  The wideencircling throng she thus address'd  'Well may ye mark me with astonish'd eyes  'Audacious hypocrite in man's disguise  'Who urg'd by passion dar'd with steps profane  'Approach the hallow'd dome of Virtue's train  'Lead me ah lead me to the dungeon's gloom  'The rack prepareI yield me to your doom  'Yet still shou'd Pity in your breast abide  'And Pity sure to Virtue is allied  'To my distress benign attention lend  'Your acts of rigor for a while suspend  'Till o'er this bier 'tis Nature's kind relief  'I've pour'd my plaints and pay'd the rites of grief  'Ah he was dearer to this bleeding heart  'Far dearer than expression can impart  'Thou who didst place us in this vale of tears  'Where sorrow blasts the plant that pleasure rears  'If as the tenets of our creed require  'Thy waken'd justice breathes immortal ire  'If love from whence ev'n here misfortunes flow  'Beyond the grave you curse with endless woe  'Ah not o'er ARABERT thy vengeance spread  'On me on me t y darts of anger shed  'For I allur'd him far from Virtue's way  'And led his youthful innocence astray  'Ah not in punishment our fate conjoin  'He shar'd the rapture but the guilt was mine'  With trembling hand she now the veil withdrew  'Tis usual to bury the monks of La Trappe in their monastic habit extended on a plank  When lo the wellknown features struck her view  Absorpt in grief she cast a fond survey  At length her thoughts in murmurs broke away  'That eyewhich shed on mine voluptuous light  'Alas how sunk in everlasting night  'See from those lips the living colour fled  'Where Love resided and where Pleasure fed  'And where bright Eloquence had pour'd her store  'Dumb Horror sitsand Wisdom is no more  'Yet ere the worm since this is doom'd its prey  'Shall steal the ling'ring likeness quite away  'On that cold lip sure LEONORE may dwell  'And free from guilt imprint the long farewell'  She added notbut bending low her head  Three times the mourner kiss'd th' unconscious dead  Now holy ANSELM urg'd her to restrain  Her boundless grief in rev'rence of the fane  She answer'd starting from the sable bier  'Can I forget that ARABERT was dear  'Can I cold monitor from hence remove  'His worth unrival'd and his lasting love  'Can I forget as destitute I lay  'To sickness grief and penury a prey  'How eagerly he flew at Pity's call  'Put forth his hand and rais'd me from my fall  'All unsolicited he gave me wealth  'He gave me solace and he gave me health  'And dearer than the bliss those gifts impart  'He strain'd me to his breast and gave his heart  'And shall these hallow'd walls and awful fane  'Reproach the voice that pours the praiseful strain  'Say at the friend's the guardian's lover's tomb  'Can sorrow sleep and gratitude be dumb  'But I submitand bend thus meekly low  'To kiss th' avenging hand that dealt the blow  'Resign'd I quit the losing path I trod  'Fall'n is my idoland I worship God'  She ceas'dthe choir intones the fun'ral song  Which holy echoes plaintively prolong  And now the solemn organ tun'd to woe  Pour'd the clear notes pathetically slow  These rites perform'dalong th' extending fane  She now attends the slowproceeding train  Who o'er the mournful cypressshaded way  To the expecting tomb the dead convey  See now the priests the closing act prepare  And to the darksome vault commit their care  At this dread scene too feelingly distress'd  She pour'd the last effusions of her breast  'Come dovelike peace to watch this sacred shrine  'And brood incessant with a love like mine  She paus'dthen o'er the yawning tomb reclin'd  In all the tenderness of grief rejoin'd  'Oh beauty's flow'roh pleasure ever new  'Oh friendship love and constancy adieu  'Ye virtues that adorn'd th' unhappy youth  'Affection pity confidence and truth  'The gen'rous thoughts that with the feeling dwell  'And sympathy of heartfarewell farewell  'Not all of ARABERT this tomb contains  'All is not here while LEONORE remains  'Methinks solicitous my form to meet  'The conscious ashes heave beneath my feet  'Methinks a voice ev'n animates the clay  'And in low accents summons me away  'Haste LEONOREthy other self rejoin  'And let thy glowing ashes mix with mine  'Ah trust me ARABERT to share thy doom  'Prepar'd resolv'd I'll meet thee in the tomb  'Forbear Oh Heav'n in pity to these tears  'To curse my sorrow with a length of years  'And when this drooping form shall press the bier  'Say virtuous ANSELM wilt thou not be near  'The friendly requiem for my soul to crave  'And lay these limbs in this lamented grave  'Then when this tortur'd heart shall cease to burn  'Our blended dust shall warm the faithful urn  'Nor distant far is that releasing hour  'For Nature now oppress'd beyond her pow'r  'Resigns at length my troubled soul to rest  'And Grief's last anguish rushes thro' my breast  Behold her now extended on the ground  And see the sacred brethren kneeling round  Them she addresses in a fault'ring tone  'Say cannot Death my daring crime atone  'Ah let compassion now your heart inspire  'Amid your pray'rs I unalarm'd expire  'Thou who art ev'n in this dread moment dear  'Oh shade of ARABERT still hover near  'I come  And now emerging from her woes  'Twas Love's last effort from the earth she rose  And strange to tell with strong affection fraught  She headlong plung'd into the gloomy vault  And there what her impassion'd wish requir'd  On the lov'd breast of ARABERT expir'd  FINIS
