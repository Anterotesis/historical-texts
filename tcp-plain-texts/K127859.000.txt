 THE SPEECH OF R B SHERIDAN E  SQ  ON SUMMING UP THE SECOND CHARGE AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS ESQ BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT IN  WESTMINSTERHALL  TUESDAY JUNE AND THREE SUBSEQUENT DAYS  LONDON  SOLD BY J DICRIE NO OPPOSITE EXETER'CHANGE IN THE STRAND AND BY ALL THE BOOKSELLERS IN LONDON AND WESTMINSTER MDCCLXXXVIII  THE SPEECH OF R B SHERIDAN E  SQ  ON SUMMING UP THE SECOND CHARGE AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS ESQ BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT IN  WESTMINSTERHALL  TUESDAY JUNE  THE general expectation from the Speech of Mr Sheridan on summing up the second Charge against Mr Hastings though exceeding all that has been recently witnessed on similar occasions was fully apparent in the brilliancy and fullness of the Court this day Before ten o'clock the Galleries for Peers' Tickets and the Peeresses' Box were crouded to an overflow In the seats for the Commons so generally deserted there appeared upwards of three hundred MembersThose in fact who did not then see the Court can scarcely form a judgment of the  spectacle  To enumerate those of distinction who were present would be to enumerate all who are conspicuous for Rank or claim celebrity from TalentsThat mind however must be insensible to excellence on which the splendor of the scene could make a more than transient impression the expectation was raised to an higher object and could the faint sketches of the Memory communicate but a remote semblance of the reality we would assert to absent Readers with more Confidence that no degree of expectation was dismissed ungratified  The Court being seated precisely at o'clock Mr  Sheridan  aroseIt would be superfluous he observed for him to call the attention of their Lordships to the magnitude and importance of the subject before them to advert to the parties who were engaged in the business or to depict the situation of those multitudes who were ultimately to be affected All this had already been done by the Hon Gentleman Mr Burke who opened the Prosecutionby him who alone was equal to the taskby him to whom Mankind was indebted for the embodied stand which was now made in defence of the general rights of HumanityNeither was it his intention to enter into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the question immediately before the Courthe would only indulge himself in a few words respecting some insinuations which had been thrown out against the persons concerned in this prosecution It had been whispered by whom he could not say that there was something malicious and something perhaps too violent in the manner in which it had been conducted Speaking for himself and as far as the heart of man could be known for the other Managers appointed by the Commons he would boldly assert that they had acted solely from convictionnot a conviction born in Error and nursed by Prejudice but a Conviction founded on deliberate and well grounded enquirythat they had proceeded not as rejoicing in Punishment but impeled by a sanguine hope of RemedyPersonal malice God forbid that they should indulge such a sensation against the unfortunate gentleman at the bar but how when they were to speak of Rapine of Cruelty and of Extortion could such ideas be conveyed but in consonant language There was undoubtedly a difference between Impeachment for capital Crimes and those for Misdemeanours only In proceedings on the mer every latitude had been indulged by usage every aggravation was employed and every act of the Prisoner tortured into Criminality No such privilege was claimed by the Managers on the present occasion but yet it should be considered by those whose Pity seemed to rise in proportion with the Guilt of its objectthat if such a mode of Proceeding was admissible in the former Case where the life of the Prisoner was affected it was still more justifiable on an Impeachment like the present where the utmost Consequences of Guilt when proved would be but a  splendid exclusion  of the Criminal from that Society which he had injured or a  trifling deduction  from the spoils of a longcontinued Extortion  It had been observed what was undoubtedly true that no complaint from the Natives of India had been presented in the course of these proceedings Those however who were first to make this observation were fully convinced that meekness in suffering was there a part of the national Character and that their terrors had been too deeply impressed not to be long remembered But though a Despair of British Justice had prevailed through that Peninsulathough their subdued hearts could not even hope for reliefyet their Claims on the Justice and Humanity of their Lordships were not thereby diminished but recommended He would not mention this Despair without accompanying the observation by proof he therefore read Extracts from two letters the first lately received from Lord  Cornwallis  the second enclosed from Capt Kirkpatrick to his Lordship from both which it appeared that such was the prevailing sense through India of the Injuries inflicted by the English and of their repeated violations of every Compact that it would be long indeed before their Confidence in English Faith or their reliance on English Justice could again be restored  To these complaints their Lordships were now to answer not by professions but by factsnot by remedial acts directed to the future but by an exemplary punishment inflicted on past delinqency  It was incumbent on them to shew to the oppressed natives of India and to future Governors and Judges that there could be no authority so high no office so sacred as not to be subject to the paramount power of British JusticeHe did not however mean to say that the the Example should be made unless the Guilt was first fully proved no God forbid that in this free and just land legal proof and legal guilt should ever be separatedTho' the greater part of the Evidence on this occasion had been with a few exceptions wrung from the unrelenting accomplices of the Prisonerfrom men who had partook of the spoils and were involved in the Guilt yet had he therefore no Indulgence to demand nor had he to request that the Court should take that as evidence on this occasion which on any other they might deem themselves bound to refuse He on the contrary was now to bring forward to their Lordships a Mass of Evidence as full as strong as competent and as conclusive as ever established the guilt of a Criminal or ever brought conviction home to the breasts of conscientious JudgesIn the performance of this task he observed he should have the less difficulty as their Lordships had attended to the whole voluminous and complicated as it appeared with a diligence which did honor to their feelings and shewed their individual sense of the dignity of that high Tribunal which they collectively formed  The first part of this Evidence to which he should call the attention of the Court was the Defences delivered in by Mr Hastings to the House of Commons and to their LordshipsOn these as being the voluntary admissions of the Prisoner unextorted by any threat and unbiassed by any persuasion much stress had undoubtedly been laid To a part of these however an objection had been made the most extraordinary perhaps that had ever been advanced in a Court of Criminal Justicean objection which when Mr Hastings was well advised as he undoubted was when he was saved from his own  rash Gui+ance  the Managers could scarcely have expected This objection was that a Part of the  first  defence in particular not having been written by Mr Hastings but by some of his friends that Gentleman was not bound by any admissions therein contained Mr Hastings on appearing at the Bar of the House of Commons had pleaded the haste in which he had written in palliation of his inaccuracies he had even made a merit of doing that himself which would be less dangerous if he had committed it to anotherBut now said Mr Sheridan that he finds that there is something more than inaccuracysomething fraught with that actual danger which he had apprehendedhe reverts to that plea which he had abandoned and declares that he had committed the trust to othersHe disclaims all his former merits and avers that in making up his tale he had not trusted solely to his own powersthat he had put his  Memory  into  Commission  and  parcelled  out his  Conscience  into different departments The structure it appeared went on whilst Mr Hastings was content with overseeing and cheering his labourersMr Shore said he you will take care to make me appear a good  financier  Major Scott my  Judgment  is reposed in your handsMr  Middleton  my HUMANITY is yoursThe work being thus doneMr Hastings surveyed it with a careless glance and adopted it as his own But now that its defects appear the Child of his Adoption becomes the object of his aversion his approbation ceases and his language is totally changedThe defence is in general made up of general denials of the Charges intermixed with encomiums on his own conductyet Mr Hasting exclaims  "Subject me to all the other evidence against meI know I can trust to their want of Recollection and their force of Attachmentbare my bosom to every shaft of Enmitybut save me from the  Perils  of my own  Panegyric  "  The  haste  in which these productions were written  was also alledged by Mr Hastings as an apology for every error but did it follow that because a man wrote rapidly he should also write falsely or was it that the truth and candour of Mr Hastings were so deeply buried in his bosom that long study alone could bring them upwards whilst the natural falshood floating on the surface could be transferred with extemporaneous readiness to every topic whether to be written or to be utteredThese were the apologies offered for the variations the admissions and the inconsistency of Mr Hastings' defences but these it was to be hoped for the sake of propriety and good sense would never again be repeated  Mr Sheridan on quitting this subject entered into a very full and happy delineation of the situation of the Princesses of  Oude  No perusal of the Turkish History he observed nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion could give their Lordships any idea of the manners of the women of high  casts  in Hindostan Educated in a profound respect to the customs of their Persian ancestors theo maintained a purer style of Preiudice and a loftier degree of Superstition dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas the Simplicity of their sentiments was equalled only by the Purity of their Conduct In those innocent retreats they were circumscribed not immured for such was the force of Prejudice that Liberty would be looked on as a curse to those to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded as an unexpiable violation However mistaken their ideas they were placed there by the hand of Piety and could not be disturbed but by a sacrilege They were as Relics on an Altar which though deposited by Superstition none but the impious would disturb  In addition to those claims Mr Hastings himself had borne testimony to the Duty which Children owed to Parents in Hindostan Yet the Bhow Begum or mother of the reigning Nabob had still stronger demands on the affection of her sonIn the year when  Sujah Dowlah  after the Battle of Buxar was driven from that territory by the English which their politic Generosity afterwards restored she bore her private treasures to his assistance and was rewarded by the respectful attachment of his future life with the devise of all his territories to her sonShe had also interfered in a quarrel between her son and her husband and when the savage father was about to strike down his son with a sabre at the expence of her blood preserved that life which she gaveThere were pleas in her favor which would have exacted the reverence of any man  but one  But these pleas the sex the age and character of the Begumsand what was yet more the deathbed recommendation of Sujah Dowlah were all of no weight with Mr HastingsThis was therefore the object of the present chargethat where he owed protectionhe had been the severest oppressorthat the weakness which should have claimed his aid but excited his violencethat he had subjected the son thus to make him the ungracious instrument of his tyranny over the parentand had first made him a  slave  in order that he might becomea  monster  The interference of Mr  Bristow  in in the differences between the Begums and the Nabob in consequence of the claims of the latter was the next ground of Mr SHERIDAN's observationsMr Bristow had then in a conversation with the Superior or Elder Begum thrown out an insinuation that the treasures which she possessed were the Treasures of the Stateand on this insinuation so termed by Mr Bristow himself had Mr Hastings founded all his arguments on that head and on which he lately appeared to place so much relianceThe Begums at that time gave up to the  Asoph ul Dowla  sums amounting to Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand PoundsOf this a part was to be paid in goods which as they consisted  of arms elephants c the Nabob alledged to be his property and refused to accept as payment This occasioned a dispute which was referred to the Board of  Calcutta  Mr Hastings then vindicated the right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana and brought over the Majority of the Council to his opinion The ideas then placed on record he had since found it convenient to disown as belonging not to him but to the Majority of the CouncilHow these opinions could be transferred it might be difficult for their Lordships though well informed of the effects of  Majorities  and  Minorities  to determine As well might Mr BURKE on a future day deliver an Encomium on that  great  and  good  man Mr  Hastings  and if reminded of his share in the prosecution alledge that he was not accountable for so  nefarious  a preceeding that his opinions when once delivered were no longer his own that at the time he had constantly acted in a  Minority  The claims however it was observable of the Nabob as to the Treasure of the Begums were at this time the only plea alledged for the seizure These were always founded on a passage of that  Koran  which was perpetually quoted but never provedNot a word was then mentioned of the strange Rebellion which was afterwards conjured up and of which the  existence  and the  notoriety  were equally a secretA Disaffection which was at its height at the very time when the Begums were dispensing their liberality to the Nabob and exercising the greatest generosity to the English Officers in distressa Disturbance in short without its parallel in History which was raised by two  Women  carried on by two  Eunuchs  and finally suppressed by an  Affidavit  Mr Sheridan then adverted to the Negociations of Mr Middleton with the Begums in when the discontents of the Superior Begum would have induced her to leave the Country unless her authority was sanctioned and her property secured by the Guarantee of the CompanyThis Guarantee the Counselor Mr Hastings had thought it necessary to deny as knowing that if the agreements with the Elder Begum were proved it would affix to Mr Hastings the Guilt of all the sufferings of the Women of the Khord Mahal the Revenues for whose support were secured by the same engagement In treating this part of the subject the principal difficulty arose from the  uncertain  evidence of Mr Middleton who tho' concerned in the negociation of  four  treaties could not recollect affixing his signature to  three  out of that number Mr Sheridan proved however from the Evidence even of Mr Middleton that a Treaty had been signed in October wherein the rights of the Elder Begum were fully recognized a Provision secured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in the Khord Mahal and that these engagements had received the fullest sanction of Mr Hastings These facts were confirmed by the Evidence of Mr Purling a Gentleman who Mr Sheridan said had delivered himself fairly and as having no  foul secrets  to conceal He had transmitted Copies of these engagements in to Mr Hastings at Calcutta the answer returned was that in arranging the Taxes on the other Districts he should pass over the Jaghires of the Begums No notice was then taken of any impropriety in the transactions in nor any notice given of an intended revocation of those engagements  But in June when Gen Clavering and Col Monson being no more and Mr Francis having returned to Europe all the  hoard  and  arrear  of collected Evil burst forth without restraint and Mr Hastings determined on his Journey to the Upper Provincesit was then that without adverting to intermediate transactions he met with the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah at Chunar and received from him the mysterious present of l To form a proper idea  of this transaction it was only necessary to consider the respective situation of him who gave and him who received this present It was not given by the Nabob from the superflux of his wealth nor in the abundance of his esteem for the man to whom it was given It was on the contrary a prodigal bounty drawn from a country depopulatedno matter whether by natural causes or by the grinding of oppression It was raised by an exaction which took what Calamity had spared and Rapine overlookedand pursued those angry dispensations of Providence when a  prophetic  chastisement had been inflicted on a  fated  RealmThe secrecy which had marked this transaction was not the smallest proof of its criminalityWhen  Benaram Pundit  had a short time before made a present to the Company of a lack of Rupees Mr Hastings in his own language deemed it  "worthy the praise of being recorded"  But in this instance when ten times that sum was given neither Mr Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the transaction until Mr Hastings four months after felt himself compelled to write an account to England and the Intelligence returned thus circuitously to his friends in India It was peculiarly observable in this transaction how much the  Distresses  of the different parties were at variance Mr Hastings travels to the Nabob to see no doubt and enquire into his  Distresses  but immediately takes for him l to be applied to the necessities of the  distressed  East India Company but on farther deliberation these considerations vanish a  third  object arises more worthy than either of the former and the money is taken from the one and demanded from the other to be applied to the use ofthe  distressed  Mr Hastings  The Money it was alledged by Mr Hastings had been originally taken to discharge the arrear of the Army It had not been applied to that use because it was received in Bills on Gopal Dos a rich Banker of Benares who was then kept a prisoner by Cheit SingMajor Scott being questioned on the subject declared that Bills on Gopal Dos were as good as Cash for that though the Principal of the House was a Prisoner that circumstance made no difference whatsoever with the other partners Thus Mr Hastings was inconsistent with himself by alledging an objection which should have prevented his taking the Money in the first instance for the purpose he had stated and Major Scott contradicting Mr Hastings removed the objection and restored the business to its original footingBut through all those windings of mysterious Hypocrisy and of artificial Concealment it was easy to mark the sense of hidden Guilt Mr Hastings himself being driven from every other hold advanced the state plea of  State Necessity  But of this necessity he had brought no proof it was a necessity which listened to whispers for the purpose of crimination and dealt in rumour to prove its own existenceTo a General leading the Armies of Britainto an Admiral bearing her thunders over the seas the plea of Necessity might be indulged if the wants of those were to be supplied whose blood had been spilt in the service of their Country but then like the imperial Eagle descending from its nest though it desolated the skirts of the rock the Motive and the Conduct would be equally conspicuous No concealment would then be necessary and they would disdain the veil which covered the dark mean arts of busy Peculation  On the Business of the Treaty of Chunar which succeeded the acceptance of this bribe Mr Sheridan was equally perspicuous and equally severe It was a proceeding he observed which as it had its beginning in corruption had its continuance in fraud and its end in violence The first proposition of the Nabob after his recent liberality was that the Army should be removed and all the English recalled from his dominions The Bribe which he had given was the obvious price of  their removal He felt the weight of their oppressionhe knew to speak his own language"that when the English staid they staid to wing to watch the first  buddings  of its Prosperity and to nip every every promise of future luxuriance  To this demand Mr Hastings had promised to accede and to recal every Englishman from the Province but by an evasion which Mr Middleton disclosed with so much difficulty to their Lordships on the last day of his appearrnce had shaken the Tree until nothing remained upon its  leafless  Branches yet a new flight was on the ask for something" Though their Predecessors had exhausted the Revenuethough they the promise was virtually recalled No  Order  were afterwards given for the Establishment of Englishmen in the Province but  Recommendations  of the same effect with Mr Middleton and the Vizier were sent and the practice coninuedIn the agreement respecting the Resumption of the Jaghires the Nabob had been duped by a similar deception He had demanded and obtained leave to resume those of certain individuals Mr Hastings however defeated the permission by making the order general knowng that there were some favourites of the Nabobs whom he could be by no means brought to dispossessSuch was the Conduct of Mr Hastings not in the moment of cold or crafty Policy but in the hour of Confidence and the effervescence of his gratitude for the savour he had just received Soaring above every common feeling he could deceive the Man to whose liberality he stood in debtedeven his  Gratitude  was  perilous  and a  danger  actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an effusion of Generosity  The transactions in which Sir  Elijah Impey  bore a share and the tenor of his Evidence were the next objects of Mr Sheridan's AnimadversionThe late Chief Justice of Bengal he remarked had repeatedly stated that Mr Hastings left Calcutta with  two  Resources in his viewthose of  Benares  and of  Oude  It appeared however from every circumstances that the latter resource was never in his contemplation until the insurrections in Benares terminating in the Capture of Bedjeygur had destroyed all his hopes in that Province At that instant the mind of Mr Hastings fertile in resources fixed itself on the Treasures of the Begums and Sir Elijah Impey was dispatched to collect materials for their crimination  "But I have ever thought"  said Mr Sheridan  "the selection of such a Personage for such a purpose one of the greatest aggravations of the guilt of Mr Hastings"  That he the purity of whose Character should have influenced his conduct even in his most domestic retirementsthat he who if consulting the Dignity of British Justice should have remained as stationary as his Court in Calcuttathat such a man should be called to travel miles for the transaction of such a business was a deviation without a plea and a degradation without ExampleThis however was in some degree a Question to be abstracted for the consideration of those who adorned and illumined the seats of Justice in Britain and the purity of whose Character precluded the necessity of any further observations on so different a Conduct  With respect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey had delivered his evidence it required some observation though made without imputing to that gentleman the smallest culpability Sir Elijah had admitted that in giving his evidence he had never answered without looking equally to the probability and the consequences of the fact in question Sometimes he had even admitted circumstances of which he had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they had taken place By consulting in this manner what was  probable  and the contrary he might certainly have corrected and  his memory at times and Mr Sheridan said he would accept that mode of giving his testimony' provided that the inverse of the proposition might also have place and that where a circumstance was  improbable  a similar degree of Credit might be subtracted from the Testimony of the Witness  Five  times in the House of Commons and  twice  in that Court for instance had Sir Elijah Impey▪ borne testimony that a Rebellion was raging at Fyzabad at the time of his Journey to Lucknow Yet on the  eighth  examination he had contradicted all the former and declared that what he meant was that the Rebellion  had  been raging and the country was then in some degree restored to quietThe Reasons assigned for the former Errors were that he had forgotten a letter received from Mr Hastings informing him that the Rebellion was quelled and that he had also forgotten his own Proposition of travelling through Fyzabad to Lucknow With respect to the letter nothing could be said as it was not in evidence but the other observation would scarcely be admitted when it was recollected that in the House of Commons Sir Elijah Impey had declared that it was his proposal to travel through Fyzabad which had originally brought  orth the Information that the way was obstructed by the RebellionFrom this information Sir Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabadbut what was yet more singular was that on his return he would again have returned by the way of Fyzabad if he had not been again informed of the dangerso that had it not been for these friendly informations the Chief Justice would have run plump into the very  focus  of the RebellionThere were two circumstances however worthy of remarkthe  fi  st  was that Sir  Elijah Impey  should when charged with so dangerous a Commission as that of procuring Evidence to prove that the  Begums  had meditated the Expulsion of their son from the Throne and of the English from Bengal should twice intend to pass through the City of their Residence and that he as he alledged from mere motives of schoolboy curiosity should choose the  primrose  pathand wish when engaged in such a business to loiter in the way and idle in the sunshineThe second circumstance worthy of observation was that if a conclusion could be made from a cloud of circumstances the inference on this occasion would undoubtedly be that Sir Elijah Impey was dissuaded by Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton from passing by the way of Fyzabad as well knowing that if as a friend to Mr Hastings he were to approach the Begums he would be convinced by his reception that nothing could be more foreign from the truth than the idea of their supposed disaffectionIt was also observable that Sir Elijah Impey at Lucknow taking evidence in the face of day in support of this Charge of Rebellion against the Begums when conversing with the Nabob and his Minister heard not a single word from either of a Rebellion by which it was proposed to dethrone the Nabob and to change the Government of his dominionsAnd equally unaccountable it appeared that Sir Elijah Impey who had advised the taking of those affidavits for the safety of Mr Hastings had never read them at the time for the purpose of seeing whether they were sufficient for the purpose or the contraryAfter so long a reserve however and after declaring on oath that he thought it unnecessary the next step taken by Sir Elijah Impey was to read the affidavits as however late they might contribute something to his information He had been led to this study by his own allegation from having been misled by Mr SHERIDAN one of the Managers on the part of the Commons who by looking at a book which he held in his hand had persuaded him to declare that a sworn interpreter was present on the receiving of those affidavits that Major Davy was present for that purposeand that whoever it was he was perfectly satisfied with his conduct on the occasion when it was actually in evidence that that no Interpreter whatsoever was presentNow said Mr Sheridan how I  by merely looking into a book could  intimate  the presence of an Interpreter could  inculcate  the assistance of Major Davy and could also  look  the satisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah Impey are questions which I believe that Gentleman alone is able to determine  He should admit however he said that Sir Elijah Impey had not strictly attended to for us on the occasion of taking those Affidavits that he had merely directed the Bible to be given to the Whites and the Koran to the Blacks and had packed up in his Wallet the returns of both without any further enquiry or that he had glanced over them in India having previously cut off all communication between his  eye  and his  mind  so that no consciousness was transferred from the former to the latter and that he had read them in England if possible with less informationhowever strange these circumstances might be he would admit them allhe would even admit that the Affidavits were legally and properly takenand yet would prove that those Affidavits were not sufficient to sustain any one point of Criminality against those who were the subjects of the present Charge  After some brief observations on some parts of the Affidavits particularly on those of a Native Officer who as Mr Sheridan observed gave a specimen of  Platoon firing  in his Evidence by giving three Affidavits in one Day he concluded with observing tha  as it would tend very much to abbreviate the discussion of the present Charge to enter more largely into the tendency of those Affidavits he should therefore make a pause for the present and take the liberty of calling the attention of their Lordships more particularly to this point on an ensuing Day  Mr Sheridan spoke for four hours and a half Nothing could be more perfect than his delivery but that at some distant intervals the excess of his feelings occasioned him to be less distinctly heard than usualAt half past four o'clock the Court adjourned  FRIDAY JUNE  The Court being seated at half past twelve after a short pause Mr  Sheridan  resumed his speech by expressing his satisfaction that in the interval of the Adjournment the remaining part of the Evidence c had been printed and laid before their Lordships as it was the wish of the Managers that every document should be before the Court at the time for the purpose of determining with more accuracy whether they had or had not borne out the Charges which they presented  Recurring then to the Affidavits taken by Sir Elijah Impey at Lucknow they formed he observed a material article in the Defence of Mr Hastings and on the decision of their Lordships respecting the weight of the allegations which they contained a greater part of this question would finally dependWith respect to one part of Charge made on the Begumstheir having shewn an uniform spirit of hostility to the British Government it had not only failed but was absolutely abandoned by the Counsel for the Prisoner as not being supported by a tittle of Evidence In deciding on the other parts of this Charge their having committed an overt act of Rebelliontheir having inflamed the Jaghirdarsand excited the Discontents in Oude their Lordships were to consider the situation in which Mr Hastings stood at the time when these Charges were madeHaving failed in his attempt at Benares his mind was entirely directed to the Treasures of the Begums He knew that such was the situation into which he had plunged the affairs of the Company that he knew he could not address his  venal  Masters unless  some measure was found He had therefore stood forward as an Accuser where he was also to preside as a Judgeand with much caution should that Judge be heard who has apparently a profit on the conviction and an interest in the condemnation of the party to be tried He would not from this infer however that the charge was groundlessbut he would argue that until fully proved it should not meet with implicit creditIt was obvious also that the attempt said to have been made by the Begums to dethrone the Nabob and extirpate the English was in the highest degree improbablebut he would not infer from thence that it was impossibleThere is in human nature a perverse propensity to evil which had sometimes caused the perpetration of bad acts without any obvious gratification resulting to the Perpetrator All he should claim therefore was that the accusations brought by Mr Hastings against the Begums should undergo a candid examination and that probable evidence at least should be brought to the support of charges in themselves improbable  Mr Hastings in his defence had complained that his Prosecutor had attempted to blacken these affidavits as rash irregular and irrelevant when they had been authenticated by the presence of Sir Elijah Impey and as he also observed being taken in an enquiry directed solely to establish the guilt of  Cheit Sing  they were merely an accessary evidence in the present case and were therefore less liable to suspicion The Reasoning in this last instance Mr Sheridan observed would undoubtedly be good but that the assertion that the enquiries were exclusively directed to the Crimination of Cheit Sing had been proved an absolute falsehood as they were really intended to justify what was afterwards to be done With respect to the epithets bestowed on those Affidavits by his Hon Friend the truth would best appear from a Review of their ContentsMr Sheridan then proceeded to remark on the Affidavits severally as far as they related to Charges against the Begums Those of the  Jemmadars  or native Subaltern Officers contained nothing it appeared but vague rumour and improbable surmiseHyder Beg Cawn the Minister of the Nabob though swearing both to Rumour and to Fact could mention no particulars of an Insurrection which was to have dethroned his Sovereign Nor was the Evidence of Col Hannay and the other English Officers more conclusive loud suspicions appeared to have been propagated at a time of general disturbance and when the flames of War were raging in the neighbouring province of  Benares  Mr Middleton though swearing after he had received his final orders from Mr Hastings respecting the seizure of the Treasures could only saythat he believed the Begums had given countenance to the rebels and as he had heard some aidThe whole of the depositions Mr Sheridan observed were so futile that were they defended in an inferior Court of Justice he was convinced that he should be forbidden to reply and told that was combating with that which was nothing  With respect to the first part of the Charge the  Rebellion  of the Begums he had examined with all the painful research of an Antiquary but could find no trace of any such transaction No blow was struckno march was made against the concealed Enemy but the Rebellion though commenced for a most unnatural purpose was suffered to die a natural DeathThe Counsel had thought proper to dwell for a time on the Nabob going to Fyzabad on his return from Chunar attended by a guard of men Mr Middleton being asked whether these men were wellappointed though on another occasion he had declared himself no military man caught in the instant at  gleam  of  martial memory  and answered in the affirmative The contrary however was proved by the evidence of Capt Edwards who attended the Nabob as his AiddeCamp and also that  those troops were actually mutinous for their pay who were then taken to stop the progress of disaffection Yet he would agree to all that the Counsel requiredhe would suffer the whole men to enter full trot into the City of Fyzabad for Capt Edwards had fully proved that it was merely the  usual guard  of the NabobIt would therefore have been disrespectful to have gone with less attendance he could have no motive for going  incog  unless he might have intended to make himself a perfect match for the insurrection which was also  incog  or thought that a  rebellion  without an  army  would be most properly subdued by a  Prince  without a  Guard  Another supposed proof of the disaffection of the Begums was brought by alledging that  Nudgics  had been raised at Fyzabad and sent to the assistance of Cheit Sing and this for no other reason than a detachment of the same number was in the list of the forces of that Rajah This single circumstance was taken as a full and compleat evidence of the identity of those troops It was no matter that the Officer second in command with Cheit Sing had sworn that the detachment came from Lucknow and not from FyzabadThis Mr Hastings would have to be a trisling mistake of one Capital for anotherThe same Officer however had also deposed that the troops were of a different description those of Begum being swordsmen and those in the service of the Rajah matchlock menThe inference to be made therefore undoubtedly was that the detachment did actually come from Lucknow not sent perhaps by the Nabob but by some of the Jaghirdars his favorites who had abundant power for that purpose and whose aversion to the English had always been avowedThe name of Sadib Ally his halfbrother had been mentioned as being highly criminal in these transactionsbut to the question why he was not punished Sir Elijah Impey had given the best answer at that Barby informing their Lordships that Sadib Ally was miserably poor He had therefore found protection in his  poverty  and safety in his  Insolvency  Every common maxim of judging on such occasions was certain to be overturned by Mr Hastingsit was generally supposed that the needy were the most daring and that Necessity was the strongest  st  mulus  to Innovation But the Governor General inverting this proposition had laid it down as an axiomthat the actions of the poor were sufficiently punished by contemptthat the Guilt of an offender should increase in a precise  ratio  with his Wealthand that in fine where there was no  treasure  there could undoubtedly be no  treason  Mr Sheridan next read the letter of the Begum to Mr Hastings complaining of the suspicions which had been so unjustly raised of her conduct and referring to Capt Gordon who could testify her innocence He also read the letter of Capt Gordon to the Begum thanking her for her interference and acknowledging that he owed his life to her bounty It had been asked with an air of some triumph why Capt Gordon was not called to that Bar He had answered then as now that he would not call on a man who in his affidavit had suppressed all mention of this important transaction He trusted that if ever he saw him at that bar he should witness a contrite zeal to do away the effects of that silence and behold a penitential tear for the part he had then taken He hoped however for the honor of human nature that Capt Gordon was then under a delusionand that he was led on by Mr Middleton who was well informed of the business to act a part o which he did not know the consequences Every feeling of humanity recoiled from the Transaction taken in any other point of view It was difficult to imagine that any man could say to a Benefactor  "The breath that I now draw next to heaven I owe to youmy existence is an emanation from your bountyI am indebted to you beyond  all possibility of return and thereforemy GRATITUDE shall be your DESTRUCTION"  The original letters on this occasion from Colonel Hannay and Captain Gordon to the Begum had been transmitted by her through Major Gilpin to Mr Middleton for the purpose of being shewn to Mr Hastings but the leaves were torn from Mr Middleton's letterbook in the place where hey should have appeared When examined on this subject he said that he had deposited Persian copies of those letters in the office at Lucknow but that he did not bring translates with him to Calcuttabecause he left Lucknow the very day after he had received the originals This excuse Mr Sheridan said he could boldly assert was a  flat and decided perjury  It could be proved by corresponding dates that Middleton had received those letters at least a month before he left Lucknow He departed from that City on the th of October but must have received those letters before the th of the preceding Month He was therefore well aware of the purity of those in whose oppression he was engaged he knew that their attachment was fully proved at the very time when they were charged with disaffection but as their punishment was predetermined he in concert with his Principal found it necessary to suppress the testimonials of their InnocenceThis Mass of Fraud and Cruelty covered as it had been by every art which the vile Agents could devise was now bared to the View by the aid of that Power who can give a  Giant's nerve  even to an  Infant Arm  The injured sufferers with tears more powerful than Argument and with sighs more impressive than Eloquence supplicated their Lordships' Justice and called for that retribution which should take place on the detested but unrepenting Author of their wrongs  The benevolent interference of the Begum in favor of Capt Gordon had been assigned by Mr Hastings in his Defence to her intelligence of the successes of the English at that periodThat this allegation was founded in manifest falsehood could very easily be provedThe only success which the British forces at that time met with was that of Col Blair on the d of September but where he himself acknowledged that another victory gained at such a loss would be equal to a defeatThe reports spread around the country at the time were of the most unfavorable castthat Mr Hastings had been slain at Benares and that the English were every where routedThese reports it was to be remarked were of infinitely more consequence to the present argument than the facts which really occurred but if any doubt remained on the mind of any man it was only necessary to recur to a neverfailing evidence in that of Mr Hastings against himselfIn a letter to the Council which was on record Mr Hastings acknowledged that from the d of August to the d of Sept which included ofcourse the time of Captain Gordon's liberation he had been confined in a situation of the utmost hazard that his safety during that time was extremely precarious and that the affairs of the English were generally thought to be unfavorable in the extreme In his defence however these admissions were totally forgotten there was also an observable inconsistency in what was there alledged that Colonel Hannay had written to the Begum in the style of supplicationbecause in the desperate situation of affairs he knew of no other which he could adopt and yet in the same sentence it was averred that the Begums had procured the release of Captain Gordonfrom her knowledge of the prosperous advances of our armyIt appeared therefore beyond the possibility of a doubt that those Princesses had demonstrated the firmness of their attachment to the English not in the moment of successnot from the impulse of fear nor from the prospect of future protectionbut at a time when the hoard of collected vengeance  was about to burst over our heads when the measure of  European  guilt in  India  appeared to be completely filled by the oppressions which had just then been exercised on the unfortunate Cheit Sing and when Offended Heaven seemed to interfere to change the meek disposition of the Natives to awaken their Resentments and to inspirit their Revenge  The  second  of the remaining parts of the Charge against the Begums was their having enflamed the  Jaghirdars  It was evident however even from the letters of Mr Middleton himself that no such aid was wanted to awaken resentments which must unavoidably have arisen from the nature of the businessThere were many powerful Interests concernedthe Jaghires which were depending were of a vast amount and as their owners by the Resumption would be reduced at once to poverty and distress their own feelings were sufficient to produce every effect which had been described It was idle therefore to ascribe to the Begums without a shadow of proof the inspiring of sentiments which must have existed without their interference  "I shall not waste the time of the Court said Mr Sheridan on such a subject but appeal to your Lordships individually to determine whether on a proposal being made to confi  cate your several estatesand the magnitude of the objects are not very unequalthe interference of any two Ladies in this Kingdom would be at all necessary to awaken your Resentments and to rouse you to opposition c"  The Discontents which prevailed in the Province of Oude had been also and with similar justice attributed to these Princesses and formed the  third  and last Article of Charge against them But the Conduct of the Officers residing in that Province the repeated complaints from the Natives and the acknowledged rapacity of Col Hannay left no difficulty in tracing those discontents to the source where they had originated The Nabob himself was so well convinced of the tyranny of Col Hannay that on a proposition coming from Mr Hastings to send him back into the Province the Nabob swore by  Mahomet  "that if the Colonel was sent back he would quit the Province and come to reside with Mr Hastings"  The Governor General some time after sent an apology for the suggestion but it was then too lateCol Hannay was deadand the Province was desolate If a Stranger just arrived and ignorant of every former transaction were then to survey the once fertile plains of Oude he would ask  "What savage  Invader  had waged such terrible Hostilities against the bounties of Heaven and the works of Man"  What  Civil Fury  or what  Religious Frenzy  had depopulated the scene even to a Waste of Desolation What pernicious  Monster  sent by vindictive Heaven had swept through its plains and with pestiferous breath blasted all it could not consumeTo these questions some native with a tearful eye and subdued aspect would have answered  "that no War no Dissentions no Monster had produced those effects which were all owingto an  alliance  with the  Eglish  and that this  disastrous connection  had been fraught with more ills than the most incenced enemy could desire or a merciful Providence descend to inflict"  That this representation was not exaggerated would appear from the description of Maj Naylor who had succeeded Colonel Hannay and who had previously saved him from the vengeance which the assembled  ryots  of husbandmen were about to take on their oppressor The progress of extortion it appeared had not been uniform in that provinceit had absolutely increased as its resources failed and as the labor of exaction became more difficult the  price  of that encreased  labor  had been charged as an additionl tax on the wretched inhabitantsAt length even in their meek bosoms where  injury  never before begot  resentment  nor  despair  aroused to  courage  encreased oppression had its due effect They assembled round their Oppressor and had nearly made him their sacrifice So deeply were they impressed with the sense of their wrongs that they would not accept of even life from those who had rescued Col Hannay They presented themselves to the swords of the soldiery and as they lay bleeding on the banks of their sacred stream they comforted themselves with the ghastly hopes that their blood would not descend into the soil but that it would ascend to the view of the GOD of NATURE and there claim a retribution for their wrongsOf a people thus injured and thus feeling it was an audacious fallacy to attribute the conduct to any external impulseThat GOD whō gave them the  Form  of Man implanted also the wish to vindicate the  Rights  of Man Tho' simple in their manners they were not so uninformed as not to knowthat Power is in every State a trust reposed for the general good and that the trust being once abused should of course be instantly resumed  Though the Innocence of the Begums Mr Sheridan continued was thus proved beyond a possibility of doubt it could not but be allowed that he argued fairly if he did not immediately infer from that proof the guilt of Mr Hastings He would go so far as to admit that Mr Hastings might have been deluded by his Accomplices and have been persuaded into a conviction of a criminality which did not exist if that were proved he would readily agree to acquit the Prisoner of the present Charge But if on the contrary there appeared in his subsequent conduct uch a concealment as denoted the fullest conciousness of guilt if all his narrations of the business were marked with inconsistency and contradiction that mind must be inaccessible to conviction which could entertain a doubt of his criminalityFrom the month of Sept in which the seizure of the Treasures took place until the January following had Mr Hastings wholly concealed the transaction from the Council at Calcutta If any thing could be more singular than this concealment it was the reasons by which it was afterwards attempted to be justified Mr Hasting's first pleaded a  want  of  leisure  He was writing to the Council at a time when he complained of an absolute inactionhe found time to narrate some pretty Eastern tales respecting the attachment of the Seapoys to their  cannon  and their dressing them with flowers on particular occasionsbut of a Rebellion which convulsed an Empireof the seizure of the Treasures to such an amount he could not find leisure to say one syllable until he had secured an Excuse for his Conduct in the Possession of the MoneyThe second Excuse was that all Communication was cut off with Fyzabad and this was alledged at the time when letters were passing daily between him and Mr Middleton and when Sir Elijah Impey had pronounced the Road to be as free from interruption as that between London and BrentfordThe third Excuse was that Mr Middleton had taken with him on his departure from Chunar all the original papers which it was necessary for Mr Hastings to consultThat the original papers had not been removed was evident however from Mr Hastings sending a copy of the Treaty of Chunar to Mr Middleton on the fourth day after the Resident's departure though it appeared that it was after to be reinclosed at a proper time to Mr Hastings to be shewn to the Council A Copy of the same had been shewn to the  Oriental  GROTIUS Sir Elijah Impey which he confessed his having read at the time when he declared his ignorance of the guarantee granted to the Princesses of Oude Looking to the absurdity of reasons such as these assigned in Defence of a silence so criminal Mr Sheridan declared that he would lay aside every other argumentsthat he would not dwell on any other topic of guilt if the Counsel for Mr Hastings would but join issue on this point and prove to the satisfaction of the Court that  any of these excuses were in the smallest degree sufficient for the purpose for which they were assigned  Amidst the other artifices of concealment was a letter from Col Hannay dated Oct which Mr Sheridan proved beyond dispute could not have been written at the time but was fabricated at a subsequent period as it contained a mention of facts which could by no possibility have been known to Col Hannay at the time when it was pretended to have been writtenWhatever else could be done for the purpose of concealment was done in that mixture of canting and mystery of rhapsody and enigma  "Mr Hastings' Narrative of his journey to Benares"  He there set out with a solemn appeal to heaven for the truth of his averments and a declaration of the same purport to Mr Wheeler the faith however thus pledged was broken both to God and man for it was already in evidence that no single transaction had occurred as it was there stated  The question would undoubtedly occur to every person who had attended to these proceedings  "Why Mr Hastings had used all these efforts to veil the whole of this business in mystery  It was not strictly incumbent on him to answer the question yet he would reply that Mr Hastings had obviously a  bloody  reason for the concealmentHe had looked to the natural effect of strong injuries on the human mind as in the case of Cheit Sing he thought that oppression must beget resistance and the efforts which might be made by the Begums in their own Defence tho' really the  effect  he was determined to represent as the  cause  of his proceedingsEven when disappointed in those aims by the natural meekness and submission of those with whom he was to act he could not abandon the ideaand accordingly in his letter to the Directors of Jan had represented the subsequent disturbances in Oude as the positive cause of the violent measures which he had adopted  two months  before those disturbances had existenceHe there congratulates his masters on the seizure of those treasures which by the Law of  Mahomet  he assures them were the property of Asophul Dowla thus the perturbed spirit of the  Mahometan  law according to Mr Hastings' idea still hovered round those treasures and envied them to every possessor until it at length saw them safely lodged within the  sanctuary  of the British TreasuryIn the same spirit of piety Mr Hastings had assured the House of Commons that the inhabitants of Asia believed that some unseen power interfered and conducted all his pursuits to their destined endThat Providence however which thus conducted the efforts of Mr Hastings was not the Providence to which others profess themselves indebted which interferes in the cause of virtue and insensibly leads guilt towards its punishment it was not in fine that Providence  "Whose works are goodness and whose ways are right"  The unseen power which protected Mr Hastings operated by leading others into criminality which as far as it respected the Governor General was highly fortunate in its effectsIf the Rajah Nundcomar brings a charge against Mr Hastings Providence so orders it that the Rajah has committed a  Forgery  some years before which with some  friendly assistance  proves a sufficient reason to remove out of the way so troublesome an acquaintanceIf the Company's Affairs are deranged through the want of Money Providence ordains it so that the Begums though  unconsciously  fall into a Rebellion and give Mr Hastings an opportunity of seizing on their Treasures Thus the successes of Mr Hastings depended not on any positive merit in himself it was to the  inspired  FELONIES the  heavenborn  CRIMES and the  providential  TREASONS of others that he was indebted for each success and for the whole tenor of his Prosperity  It must undoubtedly bear a strange appearance that a man of reputed Ability should even when acting wrongly have had recourse to so many bungling artifices and spread so thin a veil over his deceptions But those who testified any surprize at this circumstance must have attended but little to the demeanor of Mr Hastings Through the whole course of his conduct he seemed to have adhered to one General Ruleto keep as clear as possible off the fact which he was to relatedObserving this maxim his only study was to lay a foundation as  fanciful  and as ornamented as possible then by a superadded mass of fallacies the superstructure was soon complete tho' by some radical defect it never failed to tumble on his own headRising from those ruins however he was soon found rearing a similar edifice but with a like effectDelighting in difficulties he disdained the plain and secure foundation of Truth he loved on the contrary to  build  on a  precipice  and to  encamp  on a  mine  Inured to falls he felt not the danger and frequent defeats had given him a hardihood without impressing a sense of the disgrace  It had been a maxim once as much admitted in the practice of common life as in the school of philosophy that where Heaven was inclined to to destroy the Vice it began by debasing the Intellect This idea was carried still farther by the Right Hon Gentleman Mr Burke who opened the prosecution who declared that PRUDENCE and VICE were things absolutely incompatiblethat the vicious man being deprived of his best energies and curtailed in his proportion of understanding was left with such a shortsighted degree of penetration as could not come under the denomination of PRUDENCEThis sentiment did honor to the name of his Right Honorable Friend if that name could now be mentioned with additional honorBut it was still to be remembered that there were other Characters beside a  Caesar  and a  Cromwell  who acting on determinations inimical to Virtue and hostile to the laws of Society had proceeded if not with  prudence  yet with an allcommanding  sagacity  that was productive of similar effects Those however were isolated Characters which left the Vice that dared to follow either in a state of despondent Vassalage or involved it in Destruction Such was the present instance of failure and such it was always to be trusted would be that of every other who regarded such characters with an Eye of EmulationSuch was the perpetual Law of Nature that VIRTUE whether placed in a circle more contracted or enlarged moved with sweet consent in its allotted orbitthere was no dissonance to jar no asperity to divideand that Harmony which made its Felicity at the same time constituted its ProtectionOf VICE on the contrary the parts were disunited and each in barbarous language clamoured for its preeminenceIt was a scene where tho' one domineering passion might have sway the others still pressed forward with their dissonant claims and in the  moral world  Effects still awaiting on their Causes the Discord of course ensured the Defeat  After dwelling for some time time on this topic with a beauty which we find it impossible to describe and with a sublimity which has rarely if it ever had been equalled  Mr SHERIDAN reverted again to the subject of the claims made on the Princesses of OudeWhether those were first made by the Nabob or suggested to him by his Sovereign Mr Hastings tho' the counsel had laboured much to prove the former appeared to him to carry very little difference If the seizure was made as a  confiscation  and punishment for supposed guilt then if ever there was a crime which ought to pass  "unwhipped of Justice"  it was that where a son must necessarily be made the instrument of an infliction by which  he broke his Covenant of Existence and violated the Condition by which he held his rank in Society If on the contrary it was meant as a  Resumption  in consequence of a supposed right in the Nabob then Mr Hastings should have recollected the Guarantee of the Company granted to the Begums unless it was meant to say that Mr Hastings acted in that as in other instances and assured them of his Protectionuntil the very moment when it was wantedIt was idle however to dwell on the conduct or free agency of a man who it was notorious had no will of his own What Mr Middleton asserted at that Bar would scarcely be put in competition with a series of established facts by which it appeared that the Nabob had submitted to every indignity and yielded to every assumptionIt was an acknowleged fact that he had even been brought to join in that paltry artifice which had been termed the subornation of letters This practice was carried to such a length that he in the end complained in a manner rather ludicrous that he was really tired of sending different Characters of Mr Bristow in pursuanc of the directions sent to the ResidentHe had pronounced black white and white black so often that he really knew not what to say and therefore begged that once for all the friends of Mr Hastings might be considered as his and that their enemies might also be the sameAfter this it was superfluous to argue that the Nabob could direct his view to so important an object as the seizing of the treasures unless he had been impelled by Mr Middleton and authorised by Mr Hastings  At half past four o'clock Mr SHERIDAN being apparently exhausted by so very animated a speech of four hours continuance the Court adjourned  TUESDAY JUNE  Mr SHERIDAN resumed his speech at the very point where he had concluded on Friday last He felt himself too highly honored he said by the attention which had been paid by their Lordships to think any repetition necessary He had already proved to every unbiassed mind the vassallage in which the Nabob of  Oude  was kept by Mr Hastings and his agents He had proved that if ever the Nabob was independent if ever he was suffered to act from the suggestions of his own mind in this business of the  Begums  he acted under a strong and systematic compulsionHe could also make it appear to their Lordships that this dark and mysterious transaction had been conducted by three principals and three subordinates The principals were Mr Hastings Sir Elijah Impey and Mr Middleton the subordinates Colonel Hannay Hyder Beg Cawn the ostensible Minister of the Nabob and Ali Abram Cawn another black agent in the business By those it would plainly appear the whole business was transacted that the mystery of the conduct could only be equalled by the iniquity of its conclusion  Before he proceeded however to the main business of the Charge he found it necessary to remark on two particular circumstances overlooked in his former comments on the evidenceThe first of these was the pretended ignorance of Sir Elijah Impey respecting the substance of the AffidavitsHe had declared that he had no conversation on the subject with Mr Hastings because he had left Chunar on the day following their deliverythis however would not be looked on as a valid excuse when it was known that Mr Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey left that place together and travelled in company with each otherAnd what was yet more strange he pleaded ignorance of the contents of those Affidavits tho' in six days after he was found at  Buxar administering an oath to Major Davy with respect to the fidelity of his official translation of the Affidavits from the Persian languageThe second circumstance which called for notice was the suppression of the Evidence of Hoolus Roy the most active Agent through the whole of these transactionsHis affidavit was taken with the restfrom his situation it must have contained strong matter either to criminate or prove the innocence of the Begumsbut by some strange accident this strong Affidavit wasby some means suppressed  Mr SHERIDAN then adverted at some length to the contradictory accounts given by Mr Hastings of the violence used towards the Begums particularly with respect to the seizure of their Jaghires That which was undoubtedly an attrocious violence and unjustifiable fraud was at one time inflicted as a punishment for their contumacyat another the justice of the measure was so far a matter of doubt that even Mr Hastings professed his readiness to stipulate and to ensure to the Princesses a proper equivalent for those Jaghires The contradictions however were not confined to this circumstance the Nabob it appeared from the correspondence marked as it was by that  knavish halfconfidence  which was incident to such transactions had offered to submit to the seizure of the treasures merely as an  alternative  less dangerous than the resumption of the Jaghires Much ingenuity was employed to make this appear as the suggestion of the Nabob though it was clearly apparent that it was the proposition of Mr Hastings An equal ingenuity appeared in Mr Hastings's mode of  accepting  an  alternative  which was when one concession was proffered in lieu of anotherto seize on bothThe conduct of the Governor General was also illustrated in a part of his Defence where he admitted that there were private reasons for his conduct towards the Begumsbut which  "wanting the authenticity of according evidence"  he did not chuse at present to bring forward There was even in this statement a Modesty very unusual with Mr HastingsHe who in every other instance advanced Assertions in the room of Proofin the present would not state any thing which wanted the validity of recorded EvidenceThere was however sufficient to shew that in addition to the allowed rapacity of Mr Hastings there was not wanting the additional incentive of personal malice  The Conduct of Mr Middleton was the next subject of DiscussionHis scruples with respect to the seizure of Jaghires satisfied at first with  "a hint"  but afterwards requiring  "a more formal sanction"  the difference between his public and private letters and his offers to change the tenor of the former at the will of the GovernorGeneral all underwent a severe animadversion These observations involved of course a very complicated detail which though necessary to the ends of justice could if pursued by us afford but little gratification  At half past two o'clock when Mr ADAM was reading some letters of Mr Middleton and Major Naylor Mr Sheridan felt such an increasing indisposition as compelled him to retire and shortly after Mr Fox informed their Lordships  "that the Hon Manager who had taken up the present charge felt himself totally unable to proceed in such a manner as to do justice to the cause in which he was engaged"  The Court immediately arose and adjourned  FRIDAY JUNE  THE Court notwithstanding the recent disappointment occasioned by the illness of Mr SHERIDAN was this day as full as everAt Twelve o'Clock the LORD CHANCELLOR and the Mover of the present Charge appeared in their respective places and both we are happy to say in a state of recovered healthof the former we could only judge by his appearanceMr SHERIDAN afforded other grounds to form our opinionan animation which gave force to his sublimityand an energy which spread itself through his hearersHis conclusion of this day formed a climax of such excellence as cannot be describedand which when fainter impressions are faded and forgotten will cause his hearers to be envied  Mr SHERIDAN began by apologizing for the interruption which his Indisposition had caused on the former day He assured their Lordships in the strongest terms that nothing but the Importance of the Cause to which he felt himself totally unable to do Justice could have made him trespass on that Indulgence which on other occasions he had so amply experienced  He had then concluded with submitting to their Lordships the whole of the correspondence as far as it could be obtained between the principals and agents in the nefarious plot carried on against the Nabob Vizier and the Begums of Oude These letters were worthy the most abstracted attention of their Lordships as containing not only a narrative of that foul and unmanly conspiracy but also a detail of the motives and ends for which it was formed and an exposition of the trick the quibble the prevarication and the untruth with which it was then acted and now attempted to be defendedThe Question would undoubtedly suggest itself why the Correspondence was ever produced by the parties against whom it was now adduced in evidence and who had so much reason to distrust the Propriety of their own ConductTo this the answer was that it was owing to a mutual and  providential  resentment which had broken out between the Parties which was generally the Case between Persons concerned in such transactions Mr Middleton was incensed and felt as a galling triumph the confidence reposed by the GovernorGeneral in other AgentsMr Hastings was offended by the  tardy wariness  which marked the Conduct of Middleton by the various remonstrances by the Agentthough as knowing the Man to whom they were addressed they were all grounded on motives of Policy not of Humanity and of Expediency which left Justice entirely out of the Question but the great ostensible ground of Quarrel was that Middleton had dared to spend  two days  in Negotiationtho' that delay had prevented the general Massacre of upwards of  two thousand persons  The real cause however of this difference was a firm belief on the part of Mr Hastings that Mr Middleton had inverted their different situations and kept the  Lion's Share  of plunder to himself There were undoubtedly some circumstances to justify this suspicion At the time when Mr Hastings had first complained the Nabob's Treasury was empty and his troops so mutinous for their pay as even to threaten his Life yet in this moment of  Gratitude  and  Opulence  Middleton intimated the Nabob's Desire to make Mr Hastings a present of l That facrifice however not being deemed sufficient Mr Middleton was recalled and Major Palmer was sent in his room with instructions to tell the Nabob that such a donation was  not  to be attempted the Prince however with an unfortunate want of recollection said that  "no such offer had ever been in his mind"  Thus it had always been considered as the heightening of a favor bestowed that the receiver should not know from what quarter it came but it was reserved for Mr Middleton to improve on this by such a  delieate  refinement  that the person giving should be totally ignorant of the favor he conferred  But notwithstanding these little differences and suspicions Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton on the return of the latter to Calcutta in October continued to live in the same style of  friendly collusion  and  fraudulent familiarity  as ever But when Mr Bristow not answering the purposes of Mr Hastings was accused on the  snborned  letters procured from the Nabob one of which pronounced him to be blackest Character in existence whilst another  of the same date  spoke of him as a very honest fellow Mr Hastings thought it might appear particular and therefore after their late intimacy of six months accuses Mr Middleton also before the Board at Calcutta It was then that in the rash eagerness which distinguished his pursuit of every object Mr Hastings had incautiously but happily for the present purposes of Justice brough forth those secret letters It mattered not what were the views which induced Mr Hastings to bring to bring that Charge whether he had drawn up the Accusation or obliged Middleton with his  aid  in framing a  Defence  the whole had ended in a repartee and a poetical Quotation from the Governor General The only circumstance material to the purposes of humanity was the production of instruments by which those who had violated every principle of Justice and Benevolence were to see their Guilt explained and it was to be hoped to experience that Punishment which they deserved  To those  private  letters it was that their Lordships were to look for whatever elucidation of the subject could be drawn from the parties concerned written in the moments of confidence they declared the real motive and object of each measure the  public  letters were only to be regarded as proofs of Guilt whenever they established a contradiction The Counsel for the Prisoner had chosen as the safest ground to rely on the public letters written for the concealment of fraud and purpose of deception They had for instance particularly dwelt on a public letter from Mr Middleton dated in December which intimated some particulars of supposed contumacy in the Begums with a view to countenance the transactions which shortly after took place and particularly the resumption of the Jaghires But this letter both Sir Elijah Impey and Mr Middleton had admitted in their examination at that bar to be totally false though if it were in every point true the apprehension of resistance to a measure could not by any means be made a ground for the enforcement of that measure in the first instance The Counsel seemed displeased with Mr Middleton for the answer and therefore repeated the question The witness however did not readily fall into their humour for he declared that he did not recollect a particle of the letter and though  Memory  was undoubtedly not the  forte  of Mr Middleton he was not perhaps entirely faulty on this occasion as the letter was certainly of a  later  fabrication and perhaps not from his hand This letter however was also in direct contradiction to every one of the Defences set up by Mr HastingsAnother public letter which had been equally dwelt on spoke of the  "determination of the Nabob"  to resume the Jaghires It had appeared in evidence that the Nabob could by no threats be compelled to yield to their measuresthat it was not until Mr Middleton had actually issued his own  Perwannas  for the Collection of the Rents that the Nabob rather than be brought to the utmost state of degradation agreed to let the measure be brought forward on his own act The Resistance of the Begums to that measure was noticed in the same letter as an instance of  female levity  as if their defence of the property assigned for their subsistence was to be made a reproachor that they deserved a reproof for  female lightness  by entertaining a  feminine  objectionto their being  starved  This resistance to the measure which was expected and the consoling slaughter on which Mr Hastings relied were looked to in all those letters as a justification of the measure itself There was not the smallest mention of the  anterior  rebellion which by prudent  afterthought  had been so greatly magnified There was not a syllable of those dangerous machinations which were to have dethroned the Nabobof those sanguinary artifices by which the English were to have been extirpatedNot a particle concerning those practices was mentioned in any of Middleton's letters to Hastings or in the still more confidential communication which he maintained with Sir Elijah Impey Though after the latter his letters were continually posting even when the Chief Justice was travelling round the country in search of affidavits When on the th of November he was busies at Lucknow on that honourable business and when three days after he was found at Chunar at the distance of miles prompting his instruments and like  Hamlet's  Ghost exclaiming  "SWEAR"  His progress on that occasion was so whimsically sudden when contrasted with the gravity of his employ that an observer would be tempted to quote again from the same scene  "  Ha Old  TRUEPENNY  can'st thou mole so fast i' the ground  "  Here however the Comparison ceasedfor when Sir Elijah made his visit to Lucknow  "  to whet the almost blunted purpose  "  of the Nabob his language was wholly different from that of the Poetit would have been much against his purpose to have said  "Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive  "Against thy MOTHER aught"  On the subject of those Affidavits he would only make another single observationSir Elijah Impey had denied all acquaintance with their contents tho' he had been actually accompanied to Buxar by Major Davy who there translated them from the Persian for the use of Mr HastingsThere was amongst them an Affidavit taken in English from a Native at Buxar but which was first explained to the deponent by Major Davy in the presence of Sir Elijah ImpeyHow far therefore the assertion of the Chief Justice was plausible and how far this fact was consistent with that assertion he should leave it to their Lordships to determine  It was in some degree observable that not one of the private letters of Mr Hastings had been produced at any timeEven Middleton when all confidence was broken between them by the production of his private correspondence at Calcutta either feeling for his own safety or sunk under the fascinating influence of his master did not dare to attempt a retaliationThe letters of Middleton however were sufficient to prove the situation of the Nabob when pressed to the measure of rescuing the Jaghire in which he had been represented as acting wholly from himselfHe was there described as lost in sullen melancholywith feelings agitated beyond expression and with every mark of agonized sensibility To such a degree was this apparent that even Middleton was moved to interfere for a temporary respite in which he might be more reconciled to the measure  "I am fully of opinion said he that the despair of the Nabob must impel him to violence I know also that the violence must be fatal to himselfbut yet I think that with his present feelings he will disregard all consequences"  Mr Johnson also the Assistant Resident wrote at the same time to Mr Hastings to aver to him that the measure was dangerous that it would require a total Reform of the Collection which could not be made without a  Campaign  This was  British  Justice this was  British  Humanity Mr  Hastings  ensures to the Allies of the Company in the strongest terms their Prosperity and his Protectionthe former he secures by sending an army to plunder them of their wealth and to desolate their soilHis Protection is fraught with a similar securitylike a  Vulture  with Talons infixed in the heart of his victim he frights away the  lesser  Kites  and then calls the  sacrificeprotection  In all the Annals of human Tyranny or human sufferingin the accurate illustrations of a TACITUS or the luminous Pages of a GIBBON there did not occur such an instance of unexampled iniquityThe victims of this oppression were confessedly destitute of all power to resist their oppressors but that debility which from other bosoms would have claimed some Compassion with respect to the Mode of Suffering here excited but the ingenuity of Torture Even when every feeling of the Nabob was subdued Nature made a lingering feeble stand within his bosom but even then that cold unfeeling Spirit of Malignity with whom his doom was fixed returned with double Acrimony to its purpose and compelled him to inflict on a parent that Destruction of which he was himself reserved but to be the last VictimTo those who looked with an equal and impartial eye to the ends of Justice and the interests of Humanity it would appear that since the day of the  Original Sin  a scene so iniquitously cruel or so fraudfully detestable had never produced Resentment or excited Compassion  Yet when cruelty seemed to have reached its bounds and guilt to have ascended to its climax there was something in the character of Mr Hastings which seemed to transcend the latter and overleap the formerand of this kind was the letter to the Nabob which was dispatched on this occasion To rebuke Mr Middleton for his Moderation as was instantly done was easily performed through the medium of a public and a private letterBut to write to the Nabob in such a manner that the command might be conveyed and yet the letter afterwards shewn to the world was a task of more difficulty but which it appeared by the event was admirably suited to the genius of Mr Hastings His letter was dated the Fifteenth of February though the Jaghires had been then actually seizedand it was in proof that it had been sent at a much earlier period He there assured the Nabob of his coincidence with his wishes respecting the Resumption of the Jaghireshe declares that if he found any difficulty in the measurehe Mr Hastings would go to his  assistance  in person and lend his aid to  punish  those who  opposed  it  "for that nothing could be more ardent than his friendship or more eager than his zeal for his welfare"  The most desperate intention was cloathed in the mildest languagebut the Nabob knew by sad experience the character with whom he had to deal and therefore was not to be deceived he saw the  Dagger  glistening in the hand which was treacherously extended as if to his Assistanceand from that moment the last faint Ray of Nature expired in his Bosom Mr Middleton from that time extended his Iron Sceptre without Resistancethe Jaghires were seized every measure was carried and the Nabob his Feelings wounded and his Dignity degraded was no longer considered as an object of RegardThough these were circumstances exasperating to the human heart which felt the smallest remains of sensibility yet it was necessary in idea to review the whole from the time that this treachery was first conceived to that when by a series of artifices the most execrable it was brought to a completion Mr Hastings would there be seen standing aloof indeed but not inactive in the war He would be discovered reviewing his agents rebuking at one time the pale conscience of Mr Middleton and at another relying on the stouter villainy of Hyder Beg Cawn With all the calmness of veteran delinquency his eye ranged through the busy prospect piercing through the darkness of subordinate guilt and arranging with congenial adroitness the agents of his Crimes and the instruments of his Cruelty  The feelings of the several parties at the time would be most properly judged of by their respective  correspondence When the Bhow Begum despairing of redress from the Nabob addressed herself to Mr Middleton and reminded him of the Guarantee which he had signed she was instantly promised that the amount of her Jaghire should be made good though Mr Middleton said he could not interfere with the  sovereign  decision of the Nabob respecting the lands The deluded and unfortunate woman  "thanked God that Mr Middleton was at hand for her relief"  at the very instant when he was directing every effort to her destructionwhen he had actually written the orders which were to take the collection out of the hands of her agents Even when the Begum was undeceivedwhen she found that British faith was no protection when she found that she should leave the country and prayed to the God of nations not to grant his peace to those who remained behindthere was still no charge of  rebellion  no recrimination made to all her reproaches for the broken faith of the Enlish Even when stung to madness she asked  "how long would be their reign"  no mention of her disaffection was brought forward the stress was therefore idle which the counsel for the prisoner strove to lay on these expressions of an injured and enraged womanWhen at last irritated beyond bearing she denounced INFAMY on the heads of her Oppressors who was there who would not say that she spoke in a  prophetic  spirit and that what she had then predicted had not even to its last letter been accomplished But did Mr Middleton even to this violence retort any particle of accusation No he sent a  jocose  reply stating that he had received such a letter under her seal but that from its Contents he could not suspect it to come from her and begging therefore that she might endeavour to detect the  Forgery  Thus did he add to foul injuries the vile aggravation of a  brutal Jest  like the Tigers that prowl over the Scene where his Ravages were committed he shewed the savageness of his Nature by grinning over his Prey and fawning over the last Agonies of his unfortunate Victim  Those letters were then enclosed to the Nabob who no more than the rest made any attempt to justify himself by imputing any criminality to the Begums He only sighed a Hope that his Conduct to his Farents had drawn no shame upon his head and declaredhis intention to punishnot any disaffection in the  Begums  but some officious servants who had dared to ferment the misunderstanding between them and the NabobA letter was finally sent to Mr Hastings about six days before the Seizure of the Treasure from the Begums declaring their innocence and referring the Governor General to Captain Gordon whose life they had protected and whose safety should have been their justification That Enquiry was never made it was looked on as unnecessarybecause the conviction of their innocence was too deeply impressed  The Council in recommending an attention to the Public in preference to the Privae letters had remarked in particular that one letter should not be taken as evidence because it was evidently and abstractedly private as it contained in one part the anxieties of Mr Middleton for the illness of his sonThis was a singular argument indeed The circumstance undoubtedly merited strict observation though not in the view in which it was placed by the CounselIt went to shew that some at least of those concerned in these transactions felt the force of those ties which their efforts were directed to tear asunderthat those who could ridicule the respective attachment of a MOTHER and a SON who would prohibit the reverence of the Son to the Mother who had given him lifewho could deny to  maternal debility  the protection which  filial tenderness  should affordwere yet sensible of the  straining  of those  chords  by which they were connectedThere was something in the present business  with all that was horrible to create  aversion  so vilely loathsome as to excite  Disgust  if it were not a part of his duty it would be superfluous to speak of the sacredness of the ties which those aliens to feelingthose Apostates to Humanity had thus dividedIn such an Assembly said Mr Sheridan as that before which I speak there is not an eye but must look reproof to this conductnot a heart but most anticipate its condemnationFILIAL PIETY It is the primal bond of Societyit is the SACRAMENT of our EXISTENCE It is almost an  innate  principle which starts unbidden to our lip which consults not our Memory nor awaits our ReasonIt is a GRATITUDE implanted for a thousand wakeful caresa thousand nameless solicitudes for these attentions which not being remembered are the more entitled to our Gratitude as having been exercised at a time when the dawning Reason could not observe nor the in  ant Memory record It is a sensation twined in the heart's inmost core and coeval with our earliest sense of existenceThose who violated this solemn covenant must at the instant have stood convicted to themselvesthe slowjudging formalities of the law are superfluousthey are returned as GUILTY by the general verdict of mankind"  The Jaghires being seized Mr Sheridan proceeded to observe the  Begums  were left without the smallest share of that pecuniary compensation promised by Mr Middleton and as when tyranny and  injustice  take the field they are always attended by their  campfollowers  paltry pilfering and petty insultso in this instance the goods taken from them were sold at a mock sale at inferior value Even gold and jewels to use the language of the Begums instantly lost their value when it was known that they came from them Their Ministers were therefore imprisoned to extort the deficiency which this fraud had occasioned and those mean arts were employed to justify a continuance of cruelty yet these again were little to the frauds of Mr Hastings After extorting upwards of l he forbade Mr Middleton to come to a  conclusive settlement  He knew that the  Treasons  of our Allies in India had their origin solely in the wants of the Company He could not therefore say that the Begums were entirely innocent until he had consulted the general  Record  of  Crimes  in the  Cash Account  at CalcuttaAnd this  prudence  of Mr Hastings was fully justified by the eventfor there was actually found a balance of  Twentysix lacks  more against the Begums which l worth of Treason had never been dreamt of before  "Talk not to us"  said the Governor General of their Guilt or Innocence but as it suits the Company's  Credit  We will not try them by the Code of  Justinian  nor the Institutes of  Timur  we will not judge them either by the British Laws or their local Customs No We will try them by the  Multiplication Table  we will find them guilty by the  Rule of Three  and we will condemn them according to the sapient and profound Institutes ofCOCKER's  Arithmetic  Proceeding next to state the distresses of the Begums in the Zenana and of the women in the Khord Mahal Mr Sheridan remarked that some observation was due to the remark made by Mr Hastings in his Defence where he declared" that whatever were the distresses there and whoever was the agent the Measure was in his opinion reconcileable to Justice Honor and sound Policy Major Scott  the incomparable Agent  of Mr Hastings had declared this passage to have been written by Mr Hastings with his own handThen Mr Middleton it appeared had avowed his share in those humane transactions and blushingly retired Mr Hastings then cheered his drooping Spirits  "Whatever part of the load said he yours cannot bear my  unburdened  character shall assume I will crown your labours with my irresistible approbationthen we  twinwarriors  shall go forthdo you find  Memory  and I'll find  Character  and assault repulse and contumely shall all be set at defiance"  If I could not prove continued Mr Sheridan that those Acts of Mr Middleton were in reality the Acts of Mr Hastings I should not trouble your Lordships by combating these Assertions but as that part of his criminality can be incontestibly ascertainedI shall undoubtedly appeal to the assembled Legislators of this Realm and call on them to say whether those Acts were justifiable on the score of  Policy  I shall appeal to all the august Presidents in the Courts of British Justice and to all the learned Ornaments of the Profession to decide whether these Actions were reconcileable to  Justice  I shall appeal to a reverend Assemblage of Prelates feeling for the general interests of Humanity and for the honor of the Religion to which they belong let them determine in their own minds whether those Acts of Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton were such a  Christian  ought to perform or a  Man  to avow  He then proceeded to relate the circumstances of the Imprisonment of Bahar Ally Cawn and Jewar Ally Cawn the Minister of the Nabob on the grounds above stated With them was confined that  Archrebel  Sumpshier Cawn by whom every act of hostility that had taken place against the English was stated to have been committedNo enquiry however was made concerning his  Treason  though many been held respecting the  Treasure  of the others He was not so far noticed as to be deprived of his  food  nor was he even complimented with  fetters  and yet when he is on a future day to be informed of the Michiefs he was now stated to have done he must think that on being forgotten he had a very  providential escape  The others were on the contrary taken from their milder Prison at Fyzabad and when threats could effect nothing transferred by the meek humanity of Mr Middleton to the Fortress of Chunargur There where the British Flag was flying they were doomed to deeper dungeons heavier chains and severer punishments Three where that Flag was displayed which was wont to chear the depressed and to dilate the subdued heart of miserythese venerable but unfortunate men were fated to encounter something  lower  than PERDITION and something  blacker  than DESPAIR It appeared from the evidence of Mr  Holt  and others that they were both cruelly flogged tho' one was above seventy years of age to extort a Confession of the buried Wealth of the BegumsBeing charged with a Disaffection they proclaimed their innocence  "tell us where are the remaining Treasures was the replyit is only a treachery to your immediate Sovereignsand you will then be fit associates for the representatives of British Faith and British Justice in India"    "Oh FAITH Oh JUSTICE exclaimed Mr Sheridan I conjure you by your sacred names to depart for a moment from this Place though it be your peculiar Residence nor hear your Names profaned by such a sacrilegious Combination as that which I am now compelled to repeat"  It might have been hoped for the honor of the human heart that the Begums had been themselves exempted from a share in these sufferings and that they had been wounded only through the sides of their MinistersThe reverse of this however was the factTheir Palace was surrounded by a guard which was withdrawn by Major Gilpin to avoid the growing resentments of the people and replaced by Mr Middleton thro' his fears from that  "dreadful responsibility"  which was imposed on him by Mr HastingsThe Women of the Khord Mahal who had not been involved in the Begum's supposed crimes who had raised no  subrebellion  of their own and who it had been proved lived in a distinct dwelling were causelessly involved in the same punishment their Residence surrounded with guards they were driven to despair by famine and when they poured forth in sad procession were driven back by the soldiery and beaten with  Bludgeons  to the scene of Madness which they had quitted Those were acts Mr Sheridan observed which  when told needed no Comment he should not offer a single syllable to awaken their Lordship's feelings but leave it to the facts which had been proved to make their own impressions  The argument now reverted solely to this point whether Mr Hastings was to be answerable for the crimes committed by his agents It had been fully proved that Mr Middleton had signed the treaty with the superior Begum in October He had acknowledged signing some others of other dates but could not  recollect  his authority These treaties had been fully recognized by Mr Hastings as was fully proved by the evidence of Mr Purling in the year In that of Oct the Jaghire was secured which was allotted for the support of the women in the Khord Mahal on the first idea of resuming those Jaghires a provision should have been secured to these unfortunate women and in this respect Mr Hastings was clearly guilty of a Crime by his  Omission  of making such provision But still he pleaded that he was not accountable for the Cruelties which had been exercised This was the Plea which TYRANNY aided by its  prime minister  Treachery was always sure to set up Mr Middleton had attempted to strengthen this plea by endeavouring to claim the whole Infamy of those transactions and to  monopolize  the Guilt He dared even to aver that he had been condemned by Mr Hastings for the ignominious part he had actedhe dared to avow this because Mr Hastings was on his Trial and he thought he should never be triedbut in the face of the Court and before he left the Bar he was compelled to confess that it was for the  lenience  not the  severity  of his Proceedings that he had been reproved by Mr Hastings  It would not he trusted be argued that because Mr Hastings had not marked every passing shade of guilt and because he had only given the bold outline of Cruelty that he was therefore to be acquittedIt was laid down by the law of Englandthat law which was the perfection of Reasonthat a Person ordering an Act to be done by his Agent was answerable for that act with all his consequences Middleton had been appointed in the avowed and private Agentthe  secondself  of Mr Hastings The Governor General had ordered the measure Middleton declared that it could not have been effected by milder means If he never saw nor heard afterwards of the consequences of the measure he was answerable therefore for every pang that was inflicted and for all the blood that was shed But he had heard and that instantly of the whole He had written to arraign Middleton of forbearance and of neglectHe commanded them to work upon their hopes and fears and to leave no means untried untilto speak their own language but which would be better suited to the  Banditti  of a  Cavern    "they obtained possession of the secret hoards of the old Ladies"  He would not allow even of a delay of two days to smooth the compelled approaches of a SON to his MOTHER on such an occasionHis orders were peremptoryand if a massacre did not take place it was the merit of accidentand not of Mr HastingsAfter this would it be said that the prisoner was ignorant of the acts or not culpable for their consequences It was true he had not enjoined in so many words the  Guards  the  Famine  and the  Bludgeons  he had not weighed the  fetters  nor numbered the  lashes  to be inflicted on his victims But yet he was equally guilty as if he had borne an active and personal share in each transaction It was as if he had commanded that the  heart  should be torn from the bosom and yet had enjoined that no  blood  should follow He was in the same degree accountable to the  Law  to his  Country  to his  Conscience  and to his GOD  Mr Hastings had endeavoured also to get rid of a part of his Guilt by observing that he was but  one  of the Supreme Council and that all the rest had sanctioned those transactions with their approbation If Mr Hastings could prove however that others participated in the Guilt it would not tend to diminish his own Criminality But the fact was that the Council had in nothing erred so much as in a criminal Credulity given to the declarations of the Governor General They knew not a word of those transactions until they were finally concludedIt was not until the January following that they saw the Mass of Falshood which had been published under the title of  "Mr Hastings' Narrative"  They had been then unaccountably duped into the suffering a Letter to pass dated the th of November intended to deceive the Directors into a belief that they had received intelligence at that time which was not the factThese Observations Mr Sheridan said were not meant to cast any obloquy on the Councilthey had undoubtedly been deceived and the deceit practised on them by making them sign the Narrative was of itself a strong accusation of Mr Hastings and a decided proof of his own Consciousness of Guilt When tired of corporal Infliction his Tyranny was gratified by insulting the understanding Other Tyrants tho' born to greatness such as a NERO or CALIGULA might have been roused it had been supposed by reflection and awakened into contritionbut here was an instance which spurned at Theory and baffled supposition a man born to a state at least of equality inured to calculation and brought up in habits of reflectionand yet proving in the end that Monster in Nature a  deliberate and reasoning Tyrant  The Board of Directors received those advices which Mr Hasting's thought proper to transmit but though unfurnished with any other materials to form their judgment they expressed very strongly their doubts and as properly ordered an Enquiry into the circumstances of the alledged Disaffection of of the Begums pronouncing it at the same time a Debt which was due to the Honor and Justice of the British NationThis enquiry however on the Directions reaching India Mr Hastings thought it absolutely necessary to eludeHe stated to the Council that it being merely stated that  "IF on enquiry certain facts appeared"  no enquiry was thereby directly enjoined  "It would revive he said those animosities that subsisted between the Begums and the Vizier which had then subsidedif the former were inclined to appeal to a foreign jurisdiction they were the best judges of their own feeling and should be left to make their own complaint"  All this however was nothing to the magnificent paragraph which concluded this Minute and to which Mr Sheridan also requested the attention of the Court  "Beside said Mr Hastings I hope it will not be a departure from official language to saythat the MAJESTY of JUSTICE ought not to be approached without solicitation she ought not to descend to enflame or provoke but to withho'd her judgment until she is called on to determine"  What was still more astonishing was that Sir John Macpherson who had before opposed Mr Hastings was caught by this  bold bombastic quibble  and rejoined in the same words  "that the MAJESTY of JUSTICE ought not to be approached without solicitation"  "But my Lords continued Mr Sheridan I rely on the Judgment of your Lordships for a very different opinion I hear you already call on me to turn from the illshaped  Pagod  from the monstrous Idol which this bold Man at your Bar has thus set up and to which he has dared to give the appellation of JUSTICEI hear you command me to turn from the  debased Caricature  to contemplate the figure of JUSTICE where she sits in her more dignified form and her more august TribunalHEREto a  Justice  commanding yet not rigorous efficient yet not sanguinaryto a Justice active and regardful yet without  without restlessness or suspicionto a JUSTICE whose loveliest attribute appears in stooping to raise the oppressed and to bind up the wounds of the afflictedTo that JUSTICE I now make my confident appealin a Cause the most important to the interests of Humanity that has been ever brought to a decisionin a cause where though the injuries were widely extended the joyous and reverberant murmurs of redress would reach to a circle still more enlargedI will not therefore adjure your Lordships to dismiss every thing like party motives on this occasion as I well know that so perverse a bias cannot possibly intrude on your decisionBut I will conjure you by the dignity of your several characters I will conjure you by the august solemnity of this high tribunal I will conjure by that sacred tie of  houor  to which you will appeal when laying your hands on your bosoms you give the important judgmentto weigh well the Evidence which we have submitted to you Let not Quibbles on words do away the force of Fact  Let but the Truth appear and our Cause is gained  MY LORDSI HAVE DONE"  When Mr Sheridan had concluded the admiration of his Auditors was too great for  silent  approbation It unanimously burst forth in a tumult of applause which the recollection of the scene as instantly suppressedIt was a tribute of  Feeling  to GENIUS such as Form could not constrain no inferior Consideration subdue  The Court immediately rose and adjourned to the  first  TUESDAY in the next Session of Parliament  FINIS
