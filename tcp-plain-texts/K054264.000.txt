any one should entertain a more humble opinion of the following little Production than she who presents it to you It is a trifle which she confesses has but a very slender claim to your protection but she considers that your Name will be an ornament to her Book as your Friendship has been an honour to its Author  Where merit is incontestible and characters are decided by the concurring suffrage of mankind praise becomes almost impertinent It is absurd to be industrious in proving truths so selfevident that no one ever thought of controverting them  I may be accused of advancing a startling proposition when I declare that you are an enemy to the Muses but if it be allowed that description and invention are  the very soul of Poetry I shall be justified by the world in general who constantly behold you displaying talents which cannot be described and exhibiting excellencies which leave nothing to be imagined  Whatever reason I may find to regret my having ventured these little Poems into the world I shall at least have no common pleasure in recollecting one circumstance attending them since they furnish me with an occasion of assuring you with what esteem and admiration I am  SIR  Your most obedient and very humble Servant HANNAH MORE  Bristol  Dec th    Sir ELDRED of the BOWER A Legendary Tale In Two Parts  Sir ELDRED of the BOWER A LEGENDARY TALE  Part I  O nostra Vita ch'e si bella in vista  Come perde agevolmente in un momento  Quel che'n molt' anni a grand pena s'acquista  Petrarca  There was a young and valiant Knight  SIR ELDRED was his name  And never did a worthier wight  The rank of knighthood claim  Where gliding  Tay  her stream sends forth  To crown the neighbouring wood  The antient glory of the North  SIR ELDRED's castle stood  The youth was rich as youth might be  In patrimonial dower  And many a noble feat had he  Atchiev'd in hall and bower  He did not think as some have thought  Whom honour never crown'd  The fame a father dearly bought  Cou'd make the son renown'd  He better thought a noble sire  Who gallant deeds had done  To deeds of hardihood shou'd fire  A brave and gallant son  The fairest ancestry on earth  Without desert is poor  And every deed of lofty worth  Is but a tax for more  SIR ELDRED's heart was good and kind  Alive to Pity's call  A croud of virtues grac'd his mind  He lov'd and felt for all  When  merit  rais'd the sufrerer's name  He  doubly  serv'd him  then  And those who cou'd not prove that claim  He thought they still were  men  But sacred truth the Muse compels  His errors to impart  And yet the Muse reluctant tells  The fault of ELDRED's heart  Tho' kind and gentle as the dove  As free from guile and art  And mild and soft as infant love  The feelings of his heart  Yet if distrust his thoughts engage  Or jealousy inspires  His bosom wild and boundless rage  Inflames with all its fires  Not Thule's waves so wildly break  To drown the northern shore  Not Etna's entrails fiercer shake  Or Scythia's tempests roar  As when in summer's sweetest day  To fan the fragrant morn  The sighing breezes softly stray  O'er fields of ripen'd corn  Sudden the lightning's blast descends  Deforms the ravag'd fields  At once the various ruin blends  And all resistless yields  But when to clear his stormy breast  The sun of reason shone  And ebbing passions sunk to rest  And shew'd what rage had done  O then what anguish he betray'd  His shame how deep how true  He view'd the waste his rage had made  And shudder'd at the view  The meekey'd dawn in saffron robe  Proclaimed the opening day  Up rose the sun to gild the globe  And hail the newborn May  The birds their amorous notes repeat  And glad the vernal grove  Their feather'd partners fondly greet  With many a song of love  When pious ELDRED walk'd abroad  His morning vows to pay  And hail the universal Lord  Who gave the goodly day  That donehe left his woodland glade  And journey'd far away  He lov'd to court the stranger shade  And thro' the lone vale stray  Within the bosom of a wood  By circling hills embrac'd  A little modest mansion stood  Built by the hand of Taste  While many a prouder castle fell  This safely did endure  The house where guardian virtues dwell  Is sacred and secure  Of Eglantine an humble fence  Around the mansion stood  Which charm'd at once the ravish'd sense  And screen'd an infant wood  The wood receiv'd an added grace  As pleas'd it bent to look  And view'd its ever verdant face  Reflected in a brook  The smallness of the stream did well  The master's fortunes shew  But little streams may serve to tell  From what a source they flow  This mansion own'd an aged Knight  And such a man was he  As Heaven just shews to human sight  To tell what man shou'd be  His youth in many a wellfought field  Was train'd betimes to war  His bosom like a wellworn shield  Was grac'd with many a scar  The vigour of a green old age  His reverend form did bear  And yet alas the warriorsage  Had drain'd the dregs of care  And sorrow more than age can break  And wound its hapless prey  'Twas sorrow surrow'd his firm cheek  And turn'd his bright locks grey  One darling daughter sooth'd his cares  A young and beauteous dame  Sole comfort of his failing years  And BIRTHA was her name  Her heart a little sacred shrine  Where all the Virtues meet  And holy Hope and Faith divine  Had claim'd it for their seat  She rear'd a fair and fragrant bower  Of wild and rustic taste  And there she screen'd each fav'rite flower  From every ruder blast  And not a shrub or plant was there  But did some moral yield  For wisdom with a father's care  Was found in every field  The trees whose foliage fell away  And with the summer died  He thought an image of decay  Might lecture human pride  While fair perennial greens that stood  And brav'd the wintry blast  As types of the fair mind he view'd  Which shall for ever last  He taught her that the gaudiest flowers  Were seldom fragrant found  But wasted soon their little powers  Lay useless on the ground  While the sweet pink and scented rose  In precious odours last  And when no more the colour glows  The sweetness is not past  And here the Virgin lov'd to lead  Her inoffensive day  And here she oft retir'd to read  And oft retir'd to pray  Embower'd she grac'd the woodland shades  From courts and cities far  The pride of Caledonian maids  The peerless northern star  As shines that bright and blazing star  The glory of the night  When sailing thro' the liquid air  It pours its lambent light  Such BIRTHA shoneBut when she spoke  The Muse herself was heard  As on the ravish'd air she broke  And thus her prayer preferr'd  "O bless thy BIRTHA Power Supreme  "In whom I live and move  "And bless me most by blessing him  "Whom more than life I love"  She starts to hear a stranger voice  And with a modest grace  She lifts her meek eye in surprize  And sees a stranger face  The stranger lost in transport stood  Bereft of voice and power  While she with equal wonder view'd  SIR ELDRED OF THE BOWER  The mountain breeze which paints her cheek  With Nature's purest dye  And all the dazzling fires which break  Illustrious from her eye  He view'd them all and as he view'd  Drank deeply of delight  And still his ravish'd eye pursued  And feasted on the sight  With silent wonder long they gaz'd  And neither silence broke  At length the smother'd passion blaz'd  Enamour'd ELDRED spoke  "O sacred Virtue heav'nly power  Thy wondrous force I feel  "I gaze I tremble I adore  Yet die my love to tell  Beauty  with coldness I've beheld  "And 'scap'd the shaft divine  But what my guardless heart can shield  From  piety  like thine"  She cast her mild eyes on the ground  And rais'd their beams as fast  And close her Father dear she found  Who haply that way past  Good ARDOLPH's eye his BIRTHA meets  With glances of delight  And thus with courteous speech he greets  The young and graceful Knight  O gallant Youth whoe'er thou art  Thou art welcome to this place  "There's something rises at my heart  Which says I've seen that face  "Thou generous Knight" the Youth rejoin'd  Tho' little known to same  "I trust I bear a grateful mind  SIR ELDRED is my name  SIR ELDRED"ARDOLPH loud exclaim'd  "Renown'd for worth and power  For valour and for virtue fam'd  "SIR ELDRED OF THE BOWER  "Now make me grateful righteous Heaven  As thou art good to me  Since to my aged eyes 'tis given  SIR ELDRED's son to see"  Then ARDOLPH caught him by the hand  And gaz'd upon his face  And to his aged bosom strain'd  With many a kind embrace  Again he view'd him o'er and o'er  And doubted still the truth  And ask'd what he had ask'd before  Then thus addrest the Youth  "Come now beneath my roof I pray  Some needful rest to take  "And with us many a cheerful day  Thy friendly sojourn make"  He enter'd at the gate straightway  Some needful rest to take  And with them many a cheerful day  Did friendly sojourn make  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART II  ONCE'twas upon a summer's walk  The gaudy day was fled  They cheated Time with cheerful talk  When thus Sir ARDOLPH said  "Thy father was the firmest friend  "That e'er my being blest  "And every virtue Heaven could send  "Fast bound him to my breast  "Together did we learn to bear  "The targe and ample shield  "Together learn'd in many a war  "The deathful spear to wield  "To make our union still more dear  "We both were doom'd to prove  "What is most sweet and most severe  "In heartdissolving love  "The daughter of a neighbouring Knight  "Did  my  fond heart engage  "And ne'er did Heav'n the virtues write  "Upon a fairer page  "  His  bosom felt an equal wound  "Nor sigh'd we long in vain  "One summer's sun beheld us bound  "In Hymen's holy chain  "Thou wast SIR ELDRED's only child  "Thy father's darling joy  "On me a lovely daughter smil'd  "On me a blooming boy  "But man has woes has clouds of care  "That dim his star of life  "My arms receiv'd the little pair  "The earth's cold breast my wife  "Forgive thou gentle Knight forgive  "Fond foolish tears will flow  "One day like mine thy heart may heave  "And mourn its lot of woe  "But grant kind Heaven thou ne'er may'st know  "The pangs I now impart  "Nor ever feel the deadly blow  "That rives a husband's heart  "Beside the blooming banks of  Tay  "My angel's ashes sleep  "And wherefore should her ARDOLPH stay  "Except to watch and weep  "I bore my beauteous babes away  "With many a gushing tear  "I left the blooming banks of  Tay  "And brought my darlings here  "I watch'd my little household cares  "And form'd their growing youth  "And fondly train'd their infant years  "To love and cherish truth"  "Thy blooming BIRTHA here I see"  Sir ELDRED straight rejoin'd  "But why thy son is not with thee  "Resolve my doubting mind"  When BIRTHA did the question hear  She sigh'd but could not speak  And many a soft and silent tear  Stray'd down her damask check  Then pass'd o'er good Sir ARDOLPH's face  A cast of deadly pale  But soon compos'd with manly grace  He thus renew'd his tale  "For him my heart too much has bled  "For him my darling son  "Has sorrow prest my hoary head  "ButHeav'n's high will be done  "Scarce eighteen winters had revolv'd  "To crown the circling year  "Before my valiant boy resolv'd  "The warrior's lance to bear  "Too high I priz'd my native land  "Too dear his fame I held  "T' oppose a parent's stern command  "And keep him from the field  "He left meleft his sister too  "Yet tears bedew'd his face  "What could a feeble old man do  "He burst from my embrace  "O thirst of glory fatal flame  "O laurels dearly bought  "Yet sweet is death when earn'd with fame  "So virtuous EDWY thought  "Full manfully the brave boy strove  "Tho' pressing ranks oppose  "But weak the strongest arm must prove  "Against an host of foes  "A deadly wound my son receives  "A spear assails his side  "Grief does not killfor ARDOLPH lives  "To tell that EDWY died  "His longlov'd Mother died again  "In EDWY's parting groan  "I wept for her yet wept in vain  "I wept for both in one  "I would have diedI sought to die  "But Heaven restrain'd the thought  "And to my passionclouded eye  "My helpless BIRTHA brought  "When lo array'd in robes of light  "A nymph celestial came  "She clear'd the mists that dimm'd my sight  "RELIGION was her name  "She prov'd the chastisement divine  "And bade me kiss the rod  "She taught this rebel heart of mine  "Submission to its God  "RELIGION taught me to sustain  "What nature bade me feel  "And piety reliev'd the pain  "Which time can never heal"  He ceas'dWith sorrow and delight  The tale Sir ELDRED hears  Then weeping cries"Thou noble Knight  For thanks accept my tears  "O ARDOLPH might I dare aspire  "To claim so bright a boon  "Good old Sir ELDRED was my sire  "And thou hast lost a son  "And tho' I want a worthier plea  "To urge so dear a cause  "Yet let me to thy bosom be  "What once thy EDWY was  "My trembling tongue its aid denies  "For thou may'st disapprove  "Then read it in my ardent eyes  "Oh read the tale of love  "Thy beauteous BIRTHA '""Gracious Power  "How cou'd I e'er repine  "Cries ARDOLPH "since I see this hour  "YesBIRTHA shall be thine"  A little transient gleam of red  Shot faintly o'er her face  And every trembling feature spread  With sweet disorder'd grace  The tender father kindly smil'd  With fullness of content  And fondly eyed his darling child  Who bashful blush'd consent  O then to paint the vast delight  That fill'd Sir ELDRED's heart  To tell the transports of the Knight  Wou'd mock the Muse's art  But every kind and gracious soul  Where gentle passions dwell  Will better far conceive the whole  Than any Muse can tell  The more the Knight his BIRTHA knew  The more he priz'd the Maid  Some worth each day produc'd to view  Some grace each hour betray'd  The virgin too was fond to charm  The dear accomplish'd Youth  His single breast she strove to warm  And crown'd with love his truth  Unlike the dames of modern days  Who  general  homage claim  Who court the  universal  gaze  And pant for  public  fame  Then  Beauty but on merit smil'd  Nor were her chaste smiles sold  No venal father gave his child  For grandeur or for gold  The ardour of young ELDRED's flame  But ill cou'd brook delay  And oft he press'd the maid to name  A speedy nuptial day  The fond impatience of his breast  'Twas all in vain to hide  But she his eager suit represt  With modest maiden pride  When oft Sir ELDRED press'd the day  Which was to crown his truth  The thoughtful Sire wou'd sigh and say  "O happy state of youth  "It little recks the woes which wait  "To scare its dreams of joy  "Nor thinks tomorrow's alter'd fate  "May all those dreams destroy  "And tho' the flatterer Hope deceives  "And painted prospects shews  "Yet man still cheated still believes  "Till death the bright scene close  "So look'd my bride so sweetly mild  "On me her beauty's slave  But whilst she look'd and whilst she smil'd  "She sunk into the grave  "Yet O forgive an old man's care  "Forgive a father's zeal  "Who fondly loves must greatly fear  "Who fears must greatly feel  "Once more in soft and sacred bands  "Shall Love and Hymen meet  "Tomorrow shall unite your hands  "Andbe your bliss complete"  The rising sun inflam'd the sky  The golden orient blush'd  But BIRTHA's cheeks a sweeter die  A brighter crimson flush'd  The Priest in milkwhite vestments clad  Perform'd the mystic rite  Love lit the hallow'd torch that led  To Hymen's chaste delight  How feeble language were to speak  Th' immeasurable joy  That fir'd Sir ELDRED's ardent cheek  And triumph'd in his eye  Sir ARDOLPH's pleasu're stood confest  A pleasure all his own  The guarded rapture of a breast  Which many a grief had known  'Twas such a sober sense of joy  As Angels well might keep  A joy chastis'd by piety  A joy prepar'd to weep  To recollect her scatter'd thought  And shun the noontide hour  The lovely bride in secret sought  The coolness of her Bower  Long she remain'dth' enamour'd Knight  Impatient at her stay  And all unfit to taste delight  When BIRTHA was away  Betakes him to the secret Bower  His footsteps softly move  Impell'd by every tender power  He steals upon his love  O horror horror blasting sight  He sees his BIRTHA's charms  Reclin'd with melting fond delight  Within a stranger's arms  Wild phrenzy fires his frantic hand  Distracted at the sight  He flies to where the lovers stand  And stabs the stranger Knight  "Die traitor die thy guilty flames  "Demand th' avenging steel"  "It is my brother she exclaims  "Tis EDWYOh farewell"  An aged peasant EDWY's guide  The good old ARDOLPH sought  He told him that his bosom's pride  His EDWY he had brought  O how the father's feelings melt  How faint and how revive  Just so the Hebrew Patriarch felt  To find his son alive  "Let me behold my darling's face  "And bless him ere I die  "Then with a swift and vigorous pace  He to the Bower did hie  O sad reverse Sunk on the ground  His slaughter'd son he view'd  And dying BIRTHA close he found  In brother's blood imbued  Cold speechless senseless ELDRED near  Gaz'd on the deed he had done  Like the blank statue of  Despair  Or  Madness  grav'd in stone  The father saw so Jephthah stood  So turn'd his woefraught eye  When the dear destin'd child he view'd  His zeal had doom'd to die  He look'd the woe he could not speak  And on the pale corse prest  His wan discolour'd dying cheek  And silent sunk to rest  Then BIRTHA faintly rais'd her eye  Which long had ceas'd to stream  On ELDRED fix'd with many a sigh  Its dim departing beam  The cold cold dews of hastening death  Upon her pale face stand  And quick and short her failing breath  And tremulous her hand  The cold cold dews of hastening death  The dim departing eye  The quivering hand the short quick breath  He view'd and did not die  He saw her spirit mount in air  Its kindred skies to seek  His heart its anguish cou'd not bear  And yet it wou'd not break  The mournful Muse forbears to tell  How wretched ELDRED died  She draws the Grecian  In the celebrated Picture of the Sacrifice of Iphigenia Timanthes having exhausted every image of grief in the bystanders threw a Veil over the face of the father whose sorrow he was utterly unable to express  PLIN Book XXXV  Painter's veil  The vast distress to hide  Yet Heaven's decrees are just and wise  And man is born to bear  Joy is the portion of the skies  Beneath them all is care  THE END  THE BLEEDING ROCK A LEGENDARY TALE  The annual wound allur'd  The Syrian damsels to lament his fate  In amorous ditties all a summer's day  While smooth Adonis from his native Rock  Ran purple to the sea suppos'd with blood  Of Thammuz yearly wounded  MILTON  THE BLEEDING ROCK A LEGENDARY TALE  WHERE beauteous  Belmont  rears its modest brow  To view  Sabrina  's silver waves below  Liv'd LINDAMIRA fair as Beauty's Queen  The same sweet form the same enchanting mien  With all the softer elegance of mind  By genius helghten'd and by taste refin'd  Yet early was she doom'd the child of care  For love illfated love subdued the fair  Ah what avails each captivating grace  The form enchanting or the finish'd face  Or what each beauty of the heav'n born mind  The soul superior or the taste refin'd  Beauty  but serves destruction to insure  And  sense  to feel the pang it cannot cure  Each neighb'ring Youth aspir'd to gain her hand  And many a suitor came from many a land  But all in vain each neighb'ring Youth inspir'd  And distant suitors all in vain admir'd  Averse to hear yet fearful to offend  The lover she refus'd she made a friend  Her meek rejection wore so mild a face  More like acceptance seem'd it than disgrace  Young POLYDORE the pride of rural swains  Was wont to visit  Belmont  's blooming plains  Who has not heard how POLYDORE cou'd throw  Th' unerring dart to wound the flying doe  How leave the swiftest at the race behind  How mount the courser and outstrip the wind  With melting sweetness or with magic fire  Breathe the soft flute or strike the louder lyre  From that fam'd lyre no vulgar music sprung  The Graces tun'd it and Apollo strung  Apollo too was once a shepherd swain  And fed the flock and grac'd the rustic plain  He taught what charms to rural life belong  The social sweetness and the sylvan song  He taught fair Wisdom in her grove to woo  Her joys how precious and her wants how few  The savage herds in mute attention stood  And ravish'd  Echo  fill'd the vocal wood  The sacred Sisters stooping from their sphere  Forgot their golden Harps intent to hear  Till Heav'n the scene survey'd with jealous eyes  And Jove in envy call'd him to the skies  Young POLYDORE was rich in large domains  In smiling pastures and in flowery plains  With these he boasted each exterior charm  To win the prudent and the cold to warm  To act the tenderness he never felt  In sorrow soften and in anguish melt  The sigh elaborate the fraudful tear  The joy dissembled and the well feign'd fear  All these were his and his the treach'rous art  That steals the guileless and unpractis'd heart  Too soon he heard of LINDAMIRA's fame  'Twas each enamour'd Shepherd's fav'rite theme  Return'd the rising and the setting sun  The shepherd's fav'rite theme was never done  They prais'd her wit her worth her shape her air  And even inferior beauties thought her fair  Such sweet perfection all his wonder mov'd  He saw admir'd nay fancied that he lov'd  But POLYDORE no real passion knew  Lost to all truth in feigning to be true  No sense of tenderness could warm a heart  Too proud to feel too selfish to impart  Cold as the snows of  Rhodope  descend  And with the chilling waves of  Hebrus  blend  So cold the breast where  Vanity  presides  And mean Selflove the bosomfeelings guides  Too well he knew to make his conquest sure  Win her soft heart yet keep his own secure  So oft he told the well imagin'd tale  So oft he swore how shou'd he  not  prevail  Too unsuspecting not to be deceiv'd  The well imagin'd tale the nymph believ'd  She lov'd the youth she thought herself belov'd  Nor blush'd to praise whom every maid approv'd  Alas that youth from LINDAMIRA far  For newer conquests wages cruel war  With other nymphs on other plains he roams  Where injur'd LINDAMIRA never comes  Laughs at her easy faith insults her woe  Nor pities tears himself had taught to flow  And now her eyes soft radiance seem'd to fail  And now the crimson of her cheek grew pale  The lily there in faded beauty shews  Its sickly empire o'er the vanquish'd rose  Devouring Sorrow marks her for his prey  And slow and certain mines his silent way  Yet as apace her ebbing life declin'd  Increasing strength sustain'd her woman's mind  O had my heart been hard as his"she cried  An hapless victim thus I had not died  If there be gods and gods there surely are  lnsulted virtue doubtless is their care  Then hasten righteous Heaven my tedious fate  Shorten my woes and end my mortal date  Quick let your power transform this failing frame  Let me be any thing but what I am  And since the cruel woes I'm doom'd to feel  Proceed alas from having lov'd too well  Grant me some form where love can have no part  Nor human weakness reach my guarded heart  If pity has not left your blest abodes  Change me to flinty adamant ye Gods  To hardest rock or monumental stone  Rather than let me know the pangs I've known  So shall I thus no farther torments prove  Nor taunting rivals say ' she died for love  For sure if aught can aggravate our fate  'Tis scorn or pity from the breast we hate"  She said the Gods accord the sad request  For when were pious pray'rs in vain addrest  Now strange to tell if rural folks say true  To harden'd Rock the stiffening damsel grew  No more her shapeless features can be known  Stone is her body and her limbs are stone  The growing Rock invades her beauteous face  And quickly petrifies each living grace  The stone her stature nor her shape retains  The nymph is vanish'd but the Rock remains  Yet wou'd her heart its vital spirits keep  And scom'd to mingle with the marble heap  When babbling Fame the fatal tidings bore  Grief seized the soul of perjur'd POLYDORE  Despair and horror robb'd his soul of rest  And deep compunction wrung his tortur'd breast  Then to the fatal spot in haste he hied  And plung'd a deadly poniard in his side  He bent his dying eyes upon the stone  And "Take sweet maid"he cried "my parting groan"  Fainting the steel he grasp'd and as he fell  The weapon pierc'd the Rock he lov'd so well  The guiltless steel assail'd the mortal part  And stabb'd the vital vulnerable heart  The lifeblood issuing from the wounded stone  Blends with the crimson current of his own  And tho' revolving ages since have past  The meeting torrents undiminish'd last  Still gushes out the sanguine stream amain  The standing wonder of the stranger swain  Now once a year so rustic records tell  When o'er the heath resounds the midnight bell  On eve of Midsummer that foe to sleep  What time young maids their annual vigils keep  The  Midsummermen consulted as oracular by village maids  telltale shrub fresh gather'd to declare  The swains who false from those who constant are  When ghosts in clanking chains the churchyard walk  And to the wondering ear of Fancy talk  When the scar'd maid steals trembling thro' the grove  To kiss the tomb of him who died for love  When with long watchings  Care  at length opprest  Steals broken pauses of uncertain rest  Nay  Grief  short snatches of repose can take  And nothing but  Despair  is quite awake  Then at that hour so still so full of fear  When all things horrible to thought appear  Is perjur'd POLYDORE observ'd to rove  A ghastly spectre thro' the gloomy grove  Then to the Rock the  Bleeding Rock  repair  Where sadly sighing it dissolves to air  Still when the hours of solemn rites return  The village train in sad procession mourn  Pluck every weed which might the spot disgrace  And plant the fairest fieldflow'rs in their place  Around no noxious plant or floweret grows  But the first daffodil and earliest rose  The snow drop spreads its whitest bosom here  And golden cowslips grace the vernal year  Here the pale primrose takes a fairer hue  And every violet boasts a brighter blue  Here builds the wood lark here the faithful dove  Laments her lost or wooes her living love  Secure from harm is every hallow'd nest  The spot is sacred where true lovers rest  To guard the Rock from each malignant sprite  A troop of guardian spirits watch by night  Aloft in air each takes his little stand  The neighb'ring hill is hence call'd  Fairy Land  By contraction  Failand  a hill well known in Somersetshire not far from this is  The Bleeding Rock  from which constantly issues a crimson current  THE END
