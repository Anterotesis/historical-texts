 NON DEFIC  T ALTER  ALMEYDA  QUEEN OF GRANADA  A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS  BY SOPHIA LEE  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURYLANE  HE CHOSE A MOURNFUL MUSE  SOFT PITY TO INFUSE  DRYDEN  DUBLIN  PRINTED BY BRETT SMITH FOR MESSRS P WOGAN P BYRNE C BROWN AND G FOLINGSBY    TO  MRS SIDDONS  DEAR MADAM  THE high admiration I ever felt for the superior talents you have so eminently displayed in ALMEYDA could alone have induced me to venture a second dramatick production To that admiration a more intimate knowledge of you has added an esteem which is I flatter myself reciprocal Not all the various charms you dignify the Drama with can equal those of your sympathizing mind and unassuming mannersWhen thus united they form a character it would be vanity to praise tho' virtue to delight in With true gratitude  I remain  DEAR MADAM  Your faithfully devoted Humble servant SOPHIA LEE  June  ADVERTISEMENT  IT was with no less awe than deference I ventured in the present day to bring a Tragedy before the Publick How great then must be my gratitude for the liberal acceptation it has met and the tears with which it has been honoured I must have wanted taste and feeling not to have been animated by the exquisite talents of Mrs SIDDONS into an exertion of such as I possess That I have been the means of displaying in a new point of view her various powers is a most flattering recompence  The story of ALMEYDA is wholly a fiction and the incident which produces the catastrophe the only one not my ownThe deep impression made on me long since by a similar  denouement  in an old play of JAMES SHIRLEY's determined me to apply it  The Stage requires a compression and brevity which seldom improves a play to the reader I have therefore printed ALMEYDA at length marking by inverted commas the parts omitted in representation  PROLOGUE  THE Muses long through many a varying age  With truth and fiction mix'd have grac'd the stage  When weeping Constancy devoted stood  Or patriot Honour seal'd his faith with blood  They bade the deeptoned lyre responsive flow  Sublimed the suffering and diffused the woe  Applauding Greece the numbers lov'd to hear  And her stern warriors gave the graceful tear  At length her venal train Corruption led  And with the Virtues link'd the muses fled  O'er Albion's happy land they paus'd awhile  And shed the favouring influence of their smile  Her HENRYS HOTSPURS trod the martial scene  And sir'd to heroes whom they found but men  Bold SHAKESPEAR pour'd th' invigorating strain  And ROWE and sweeter OTWAY fill'd the train  What if the modern bard no more aspire  To rival OTWAY's sweetness SHAKESPEAR's fire  What if no laurel meed his altar claim  His censer boast no heav'nenkindled flame  Yet if beneath the smould'ring vapour shine  But one faint glimmering of the spark divine  Ah gently fan the flame lest fashion's breath  O'er the pale promise send the blast of death  Nor let the wreath Thalia only wear  Her sister muse deserves so well to share  'Tis her's the generous feeling to impart  That mends the morals while it fills the heart  Her's are the energies that best inform  The sighs that animate and tears that warm  Within the magic sunshine of her eye  Truth Honour Loyalty and Valour lie  All the  ord virtues that our sires approved  And all that Britons boast or Britons loved  Th  n  gainst the charm no more your bosom steel  But own the manly privilege to feel  olly and Vice may oft in smiles appear  But bashful Virtue veils her in a tear  The bread loud laugh the mirthinspiring jest  Humour's wild frolic and gay fancy's feast  Like brilliant bubbles sparkle o'er the mind  But burst and leave no radiant gleam behind  While the bright pencil of the tragic muse  Her sacred rainbow draws o'er chilling dews  And tho' to air the transient glories run  They give the promise of a golden sun  The PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE were written by Miss HARRIET LEE  CHARACTERS  Ramirez  King of

Hall in the Castle of Moorish architecture with window  of painted glass in the recesses of the arches low sofas are placed with cushions piled on one of these  VICTORIA  slumbers while  RAMIREZ  walks in the Hall making notes in his tablets bright fleecy clouds rise behind the painted glass representing the dawn of day  RAMIREZ  REMOVE those lightsthe day once more returns  And nature springs into renew'd existence  Collects the fragrance breathing o'er her bosom  And offers up the incense to the morn  Slow o'er the mazes of the Guadalquiver  Curl the soft mists that quicken ev'ry odour  All animated beings gladly rise  To their diurnal taskMan only man  That froward fav'rite of indulgent heav'n  Drops from his weary eye the ungrateful tear  To blight the coming blessingdear Victoria  Thy watching hath o'erpower'd theesoft my child  Like this be all thy slumbers  Victoria  Have I slept  I pray you pardon the unconscious fault  And bless to me the morn  half kneeling  Ramirez  May each to come  Breathe only peace upon thee and restore  Those roses with ring on the shrine of friendship  Victoria  Alas my father bless too my Almeyda  That  so  itary  sov'reign born to weep  The greatness thousands covet thro' the night  Sleepless and tearful she has still entreated  That I would win you ever to retain her  A Moor  in name  alone Granada's throne  Charms not her heartpossess'd and alienate  Ramirez  I cannot chuse but blame ev'n thee my child  If thou hast sought to win her from her duty  Victoria  Nay rather blame the parents who resign'd her  Ramirez  Forbear these rash conclusionsMonarchs oft  I  ust sacrifice each feeling to their duty  Victoria  Alas that aught should break the tie of nature  The ductile heart as reason dawns still takes  A soft impression of the nearest object  Thus did Almeyda'syet an infant hostage  She wak'd to knowledge on a foe's kind bosom  Her lips first falter'd our Castilian tongue  And with becoming gratitude she found  In those who fondly train'd her up to honor  Each dear each sacred tie of love and nature  Nor did she mourn her sires or brother's death  As she does now to leave us  Ramirez  Nor have I  My daughter illdeserv'd this gen'rous fondness  Since with my children she has shar'd my heart  No tho' to death I hate the Moorish race  Vindictive and insatiatetho' my sword  Ev'n yet could flame amid my country's foes  With energy unbroken never knew I  To view a tender babe with abhorrence  Ah sweet Almeyda in this very hall  Thy cries unconscious of thy fate assail'd  A heart alive to nature and humanity  When with the error of soft innocence  Thy little arms clung round thy father's foe  Victoria  Was this the castle where Almanzor chose  To lodge his queen for safety  Ramirez  Ayand wife  Had prov'd his choice if Heav'n their arms had prosper'd  Thou seest'tis solid as the rock that bears it  Its proud tow'rs shadow our Castilian plains  Tho' sever'd from them by the Guadalquiver  They since have aw'd their ownerFor that day  Heaven blest the holy valour it inspir'd  That memorable day gave to our arms  An host almost unnumber'd but by slain  Flush'd with our conquest we assail'd this castle  Which the intimidated queen threw open  And as an hostage gave us up her daughter  Victoria  Oh mother illdeserving my Almeyda  Ramirez  Erroneous youth still takes the first impression  Nor looks beyond the surface Be more wise  Learn to pierce through the veil of policy  Undazzled by its coloursSo thy friend  Shall better meet the future  Victoria  I attend  With reverence so profound each other sense  Is lost in hearing  Ramirez  Know the queen thy censure  Condemns unheard should rather claim thy pity  Match'd to a monarch weak vain cold of heart  Yet  restless  tho'  inactive  her short life  Pass'd in disquiet from the hour that call'd her  Almanzor's crafty brother gain'd the pow'r  And in the king's name shelter'd every baseness  Two rising princes scorn'd their uncle's sway  Alas perhaps too boldlyheav'n alone  Can judge the malady that nipp'd their bloom  Certain it is Abdallah never offer'd  A due equiv'lent for our royal hostage  Until she heir'd Granada  Victoria  Sweet Almeyda  Is this the savage trusted with thy welfare    Thou  too perhaps art doom'd by his ambition  Ramirez  Not so my daughterPoliticians ever  Present a puppet to the public eye  While they unseen delight to guide its motions  Almeyda thus is needful to her uncle  Who hopes to find in her a weak vain woman  Victoria  Heav'n for his punishment then form'd an angel  Who like Almeyda ever knew to blend  Th' eccentric noble wildness of the Moor  With ev'ry polish'd grace of our Castile  Ramirez  She is too frank incautious and ungovern'd  More rude than cataracts her passions rage  Victoria  Yet  still  like those profusely pour upon us  Rich  ore  for ever else beyond our reach  Ramirez  She must  conceal  those passions to be  great  Subdue  them to be  happy  In the mind  All sov'reignty begins and endsWho rules  Impartially the frailties of his nature  Rises almost beyond it and extends  Far as his name is known a willing empire  Teach thy fair friend my child this useful lesson  And next thy brother  Victoria  Ah alike he needs it  I dread the wild concussion of his passions  When he shall learn you choose the very hour  In which he bravely fights his country's battles  To yield the fair who gives his life a value  Ramirez  I  therefore  choose it Well I know his temper  Is like Almeyda's own warm and ungovern'd  Misjudging boy to fix thy idle heart  On her forever placed beyond thy reach  Why saw I not in childhood this fond love  Which like a blight clings to my life's best blossom  Yet could  my  son ere hope to wed Almeyda  Victoria  Alas my father when their love commenc'd  Almeyda had two brothers and my mother  Still fondly fancied by this union peace  Might one day bless the long contesting nations  Ramirez  Romantic dream of youth and idle passion  What pow'r can reconcile the cross and crescent  Victoria  Frown not my father if I further add  Endear'd to christian laws and christian manners  Almeyda were to both an easy convert  RAMIREZ  sternly  Victoria if thou would'st atone thy fault  In cherishing this weakness join to soothe  Thy brother's disappointmentTell Alonzo  My love for himmy justicenay my prudence  Constrain me to resign his heart's sole object  Knows he not hardly we maintain our ground  Against these treach'rous neighbours and must still  Whate'er the sacrifice defend our country  No news from Murcia yetOh how I long  To hear the issue of the impending battle  The rising sun gleams on the Moorish helms  And gives a trembling lustre to yon fields  Th' appointed moment comes to sign the treaty  I see Almeyda too but dare not meet her  Far be it from me to offend her feelings  Or sacrifice my ownbid her adieu  Exit Ramirez  ALMEYDA  entering on the other side  During this trying interval Victoria  I had prepar'd myself to meet the King  And now with breathless fear impatient sought him  Ah wherefore flies he then Still he relents not  Thou or I greatly err hast sued in vain  Hast sued  a Sov'reign  might remain in bonds  And yield dominion for implicit duty  Well then I bow disdainful to my fate  Yet have a care Ramirez thy proud heart  May one day feel the pang that pierces mine  Victoria  What means my dear Almeyda  Almeyda  Ah Alonzo  Thou  wilt not thus resign  thou  wilt not scorn me  Amid the rage of armsthe din of battle  Almeyda's sighs shall still be heard still felt  And counteract all policyalas  may err and ev'n Alonzo  May bid the eagle glory chace the dove  And see the victim flutter to the ground  Alonzo leads the war and quite forgets me  Victoria  Gentle Almeydagovern these wild transports  Which ever warp your judgment  Almeyda  Do not hope it  Nor venture to decide a lover's conduct  tranquil blood flows equal thro' thy veins  Like the clear riv'let thro' the grassy vale  While mine impetuous as the bounding billows  Swells to my heart thence rapidly returns  And in the tumult swallows up wreck'd reason  Hadst thou like me been bosom'd among strangers  And giv'n thy soul in recompence for love  When found thyself torn from this happy home  To waste a gaudy life in cold indifference  Like mine thy aching sense would swell to anguish  Like mine in tears would drown thee  Victoria  Yet believe  Alonzo's love unblemished as his honor  And rather  praise  than  blame  his sense of duty  Almeyda  Why wilt thou shame my cheekAlas Victoria  Had I rememb'red  mine  ne'er had I shed  These burning dropsev'n at this awful hour  When from the grave my ancestors demand me  To all the pride and pow'r of purple empire  My heart flies back to hover near my love  And envies ev'ry slave who daily sees him  Victoria  This is alike erroneousdarling friend  With steadier eye survey the past and future  So shall your mind extract repose from reason  Almeyda  Away with  eason  melancholy hermit  Who idle eyes the storm then vainly active  Collects and treasures ev'ry wreck of passion  I shall have hopeless years enough for reason  And give this hour to loveOh say Victoria  And yet I dread to hearis the King fixed  To ratify the peace  Victoria  He has no choice  The rights of nations and his country's welfare  Oblige him to restore you  Almeyda  Rather say  He has no heartnor feels for my affliction  Ah if the rights of nations were his rule  Why did he subjugate a Monarch's daughter  Why win her easy heart by gracious treatment  Until secure of silent anxious duty  He gave the Moors a Queenhimself a slave  Victoria  Wherefore reproach my father with his virtues  He conquer'd for his countrythat loved cause  Induc'd him first to  keep  and now to  yield  you  Rather admire th' impartiality  Which ranked you with his children in his heart  Perhaps ev'n deeper motives sway'd his conduct  Perhaps he stood between you and an uncle  Who views with jealous eyes your right of empire  Almeyda  Nay now Ramirez speaks from prejudice  Whom should I trust if not my father's brother  Victoria  In  Heav'n  and your integrity but never  In this vindictive subtle savage Moor    Without  he is as specious as the mountain  Whose rich fertility delights each gazer  But oh volcanos rage  within  and gath'ring  Each noisome vapour of the o'ercharg'd earth  Forth unsuspected bursts the flaming deluge  Felt  soon as  seen  ev'n to annihilation  Almeyda  Alas and is it thus To such a wretch  Must I be render'd up in ignorance  To learn the science of hypocrisy  With worldly art to arrange each little sentence  And preconcert each actionNever more  Shall I enjoy the sweets of confidence  Or find in love a pleasureNever more  Shall thy harmonious voice Alonzo charm me  Or thine dear rigid friend reproving soothe  VICTORIA  taking her hand  Yet shall the vows that bound our youthful hearts  Remain inviolate  Almeyda  And shall Alonzo's  Ah no for nature here makes a distinction  Forms man's large heart for many a various duty  And blends his passion into a republic  While woman born for love and softness only  Delights to feel love's absolute dominion  Then tell thy brother  Confused shouts heard  Victoria  Look up dear Almeyda  Revive and speak thy purpose  ALMEYDA  leaning on her and fluttered  Tell thy brother  Almeyda will not bind him by one vow  Nor claim one sacrificePleas'd to have lov'd  Pleas'd to have been belov'dto that remembrance  She consecrates each future throb of passion  And if she dares imagine yet a joy  'Twould be to  know  him blest she might have made so  Victoria  My father comesOh now my best Almeyda  Now  be yourself and dignify the moment  ALMEYDA  faintly  'Tis not in dying we must shew our courage  Ah no 'tis in the fearful preparation  Enter  RAMIREZ  attended  Health to my benefactor glorious title  More dear than that of fatherHe but gives  A vulgar being while the man who rears  Our virtues to existence is next Heav'n  The worshipp'd of our reason  Ramirez  Rise Almeyda  Queen of Granada rise we gladly hail thee  Thy kinsman comes to invest thee with dominion  And give thee to an eager nation's eyes  I glory thus accomplish'd to return thee  Almeyda  Ah reconcile me to my fate by coldness  Know all the danger of this tender flatt'ry  Ramirez  In the poor word adieu I sum each wish  Affection ever form'd in blessing virtue  Farewel at onceI yield thee to thy duty  Call into action ev'ry latent pow'r  Reign o'er  thyself  so shalt thou bless thy people  ALMEYDA  flying towards them  Tear out this heart but do not do not quit me  Oh do not snap at once each link in life  And leave me  solitary  in creation  Ramirez  Afflict us not with such a vain request  Ev'n now our troops evacuate the castle  And thine assume each postAbdallah waits  To pass one gate until I quit the other  Farewel Almeyda grace thy glorious fortune  ALMEYDA  sinks under the regal Canopy in tearsThe Moorish Music sounds and a long train entering do her homage and arrange on each side last comes  ABDALLAH  with the Diadem borne before him  ABDALLAH  doing homage  Fair daughter of Almanzor thus his brother  Hails thy return to freedom and dominion  Thus tenders thee thy rich inheritance  And thus the formal task of duty ended  Clasps thee with kindred sympathising love  Bids those bright eyes shake off the lucid drops  And beam with all their own unequall'd lustre  Almeyda  Alas already he begins to flatter  aside  I were not worthy of your tender'd love  My princely uncle could I thus forget  At once the friends who rear'd me  ABDALLAH  with a fierce irony  Friends  do you call them  You are too young thus nicely to distinguish  Give not the crafty foe such undue honour  Call those indeed  your friends  who now surround you  Call the fierce soldiers too  your friends  who spread  In proud array o'er yonder pleasant plain  Nor think him  less  your  friend  whose policy  Fomented the rebellion which oblig'd  Ramirez to restore you  Almeyda  Oh my heart  Alonzo's absence then I owe to you  aside  Noble Abdallah be but gentle with me  And I will meekly bear ev'n reprehension    All  are my  friends  who only wish to serve me  Yet let me add I hardly owe those more  Who give my crown than he who form'd me for it  Abdallah  Curse on his polish'd arts they've made thee subtle  And I must deeply probe thy nature's weakness  Ere yet thou charm'st each hearer  aside  Fair Almeyda  Emancipate thy soul from this fond bondage  Live to Granada and forget Castile  No more repeat with cherish'd latent love  Names we were born to hate but seek to win  By partial kindness those who ever dread  The empire of a woman  Almeyda  Have  I  empire  Ah no for in the hour that ought to give it  I first experience bondage Stay Ramirez  King of Castile Oh hear me and return  Again receiveprotect me Bind these  hands  But give my  heart  its freedom Dear Victoria  Fix not thy tearful eyes upon these walls  Lest I renounce all duties and all ties  To dwell with thee and friendship Noble lords  Pardon I pray frank nature's ebullition  And see ev'n virtue in the eager transport  The love I thus avow was fairly won  By equal love and everlib'ral treatment  Be like Castile indulgent and this heart  Alike will glow with gratitude to you  Will proudly cherish ev'ry regal virtue  Shut out regret for all which it resigns  Nor own ev'n to itself it wants  a joy  While yet  a duty  claims it  Abdallah  This  is reason  There spoke the royal heiress of Almanzor  And no Castilian  slave  Almeyda  Still must I struggle  aside  Abdallah  Why do those beauteous eyes still seek the ground  Oh raise them and survey the golden future  Thou know'st not yet the pleasures of dominion  Be willing to be happy and each means  Indulgent Heav'n in plenitude of pow'r  E'er gave humanity is thineFor thee  Rich nature crowns this land with varying beauty  And lab'ring art here fixes his perfection  The sea wafts hither every foreign treasure  And paleeyed science waits to tell their value  For thee the poet's light hand sweeps the lyre  With melody unequall'd Happy thousands  But wait to view thee and to want a wish  While those inur'd to mis'ry in thy coming  Find an uncertain hope that soothes each pain  Oh new to life accept enjoy its blessings  Come forth and he ador'd My son awaits thee  Thy father's vet'rans under his command  Impatiently require their blooming queen  ALMEYDA  giving him her hand  Conduct me wheresoe'er my duty calls  And oh may no unbidden pang intrude  To dim with tears these gildings of my fortune  Exeunt the Music sounding  ACT II  SCENE I  A COURT IN THE CASTLE  Enter  ABDALLAH  and  ORASMYN  ABDALLAH  WHEN wilt thou learn my son to guard thy heart  Which speaks but too expressively by glances  I would not wish the council to discern  They but propose our pleasure  Orasmyn  Pray you pardon  If ardent nature stifles feebler reason  Could I behold Almeyda and restrain  This glow of transport ne'er could I deserve  Th  bliss our prophet promises the faithful  No not himself▪ though Heav'n inspir'd ere fancied  So exquisite a beauty Yet that charm  Nature's prime gift to woman in Almeyda  Is lostabsorpt in mind  Abdallah  Check not thy transport  For tho' to others I would have thee silent  To me be wholly frank and thus reward me  For all my anxious fond solicitude  Thro' many a long long year I own I fear'd  That haughtiness illsuited to her years  Would strike thee with displeasure  Orasmyn  Call not thus  The sacred consciousness that waits on beauty  And awes the wishes it awakes I ever  Disdain'd our narrow laws which make the sex  Domestic artificial beings merely  No 'tis a character refin'd decided  That greatly charms the soul and charms for ever  Why knew I not  before  she was unequall'd  ABDALLAH  smiling scarcastically  Perchance ev'n now  I  know it not yet hear  These youthful flights well pleas'd for thus each lover  Adorns his fancy's choice  Orasmyn  But who can boast  A choice like mine Nor did ev'n I suspect  Indulgent Heav'n in prodigality  Had center'd all perfections in one woman  I came prepared by rigid rules to judge her  Her  before whom all rules all modes must vanish  For oh when first my eyes beheld the queen  My heart avow'd her empire ere my tongue  I wond'ring gaz'd and gazing more more wonder'd  Ethereal loveliness informs her frame  And beams in living glory from her eyes  Yet o'er these charms sublime meek modesty  Draws a transparent veil of wand'ring graces  As fleecy clouds flit o'er the noon day sun  And leave us opportunity to gaze  Upon an orb too bright else for beholding  Abdallah  I could grow once again a boy to hear thee  Graces I could perceivenot perfect beauty  Orasmyn  Beauty's an indeterminate idea  Till fix'd by lovewhose everpow'rful magic  Awakens a new beinglove when heav'n  Leaves to the vulgar sense its work imperfect  Illumes our sight to trace the angel there  Thro' love we share our Maker's great prerogative  Creating  ev'ry charm and then approving  Yet when she spoke I half forgot her beauty  Oh with what melting harmony she won  The very air to silence no rude breath  Dar'd blend with her's but nature's self stood hush'd  Awestruck ev'n as Orasmyn  Abdallah  Be warn'd in time  Against a rev'rence so profound for women  Capricious still and wayward often scorn  Who grasps with  trembling  hand the fancied setter  While with distinguishing regard they view  The bolder man who wears it as an ornament  ORASMYN  disdainfully  How should this gen'ral censure touch Almeyda  Abdallah  Nay then thou lov'st indeed if thou hast found  Already  she is peerlessI have done  E'en win her thy own way but win her quickly  To match thee with Almeyda and exalt thee  To empire in her right has been I own  The object of my lifenor should I think  That life itself too dear to crown my purpose  In the bold outline of my policy  I heeded not 'tis true the glowing colours  Fond fancy gives her fav'ritesyet those tints  Complete life's picture wellto see thee great  Was all I ask'd but to behold thee happy  Leaves me without a wish  Orasmyn  Still in this  As in each incident of various life  I owe much to my father yet for once  This heart asserts a right to guide itself  Nor would obtrude too early on Almeyda  passion she might doubt  Abdallah  Again  thou err'st  But could'st thou win my judgment to approve  This idle scruple it were now too late  The Council know my thoughts and have ere this  Propos'd thee to the Queen  Orasmyn  Presumptuousrash  Abdallah  Judicious  rathersee'st thou not the prudence  To bind her to compliance e'er she knows  The pow'r the pride the pleasure of dominion  Orasmyn  But what can bind  the heart  save its own choice  I would have woo'd her with watchful eyes  Such unremitting tender prompt affection  As might have won her of herself and crown'd  The future days of both with happiness  Oh never let ambition tie the knot  Pure love alone can hallow  Abdallah  Would 'twere tied  Tho' all this wooing follow'dson I tell thee  Essential is the diff'rence of her state  Immured within this castle where I reign  While thou without maintain'st a like controul  And an obsequious council speak our will  To the elation of unbounded pow'r  The sweets of flatt'ry and the charm of fondness  The glowing grace of popularity  Almeyda wants not shrewdness soon to learn  If she would see Granada she must wed thee  ORASMYN  turning sorrwfully from him  More changeable than are the vernal clouds  Which borrow heav'n's own hues one hour to charm us  And e'er the next burst in a gloomy deluge  Is the fond happiness a lover fancies  Oh I do fear me mine is gone already  Did she not bear an elevated mind  She might unconscious share a common fate  And so perhaps might Icontent to lose  Our lives in apathy and call it duty  But well Almeyda knows the rights of sex  Of rank and all the heart's refin'd distinctions  Nor did she meet in mine one uncongenial  Pardon my Lord those vain regretsI'll quell them  And once more wait thee  Exit  Abdallah  It is ever so  Still in fruition are our wishes punished  Orasmyn I would have thee  wed  thy cousin  But why this adorationwhen I see her  The spirits of the dead arise before me  And wither all my projects all my pow'rs  Wherefore should man invent a hell  hereafter  Alas guilt makes one  here  and he who sins  Tho' never mortal eye or voice reprove him  Finds in his bosom every fiend that peoples  The dark profoundin her I see her brothers  Yet must she be Orasmyn's bride or  nothing  Exit  SCENE II  THE APARTMENT OF THE QUEEN  Enter  ALMEYDA  followed by  ABRA  Almeyda  "Are these the charms of empire Have we "pow'r  "To give that happiness we ne'er must know  "The meanest slave attending on our

a distinguished fortune  Almeyda  He meanly therefore placed thee near our person  A busy advocateRetire and leave me  Exit Abra  I am environ'd by such sycophants  And unobserv'd can scarcely breathe a sigh  Thinks he by little arts like these to win me  No were my heart not wholly thine Alonzo  Th' aspiring selfish lover ne'er should gain it  Yet much I dread Abdallah On his brow  Lives a black penetration which deeppierces  Thro' virtue's thin and variable complexion  Extracting oft in blushes the soul's meaning  Ah wherefore breaks he on me  Enter  ABDALLAH  Abdallah  Sweet Almeyda  Swift are the feet of those who bear glad tidings  Already hath the council's wise proposal  Already hath thy gracious silence reach'd me  Blest beyond fathers in a son 'tis thou  Thou only who canst bless me with a daughter  Almeyda  Silence my lord implies not a decision  rn in affliction and in slav'ry nurtur'd  The world and all its ways to me unknown  I must have time to learn the needful science  Abdallah  Thou shalt escape the deep laborious study  Enjoy the sweets of life with care unmix'd  Become at once the idol of Orasmyn  And of a joyful people  Almeyda  I want fancy  To tinge the picture with so  rich  a colour  Rais'd on a sudden to a fearful height  I view uncertain which to choose the paths  That wind around me in the world's vast maze  Abdallah  Orasmyn's hand will

perhaps he thinks mere death indulgence  And therefore leaves me leisure for reflection  An awful pause 'twixt life and immortality  Is this the Murcian victor This the heir  Of great Ramirez that Castilian sun  Which rose to light a nation on to virtue  Or early set amid a crimson glory  Eclips'd at once the victim of his passions  He aids his murderers and but hopes oblivion  Long will my

rights of rank  To want all common blessings Never more  Alas shall this sweet visionary find them  Abdallah  Has then her frenzy known no interval  And the long night elapsed in restless ravings  Orasmyn  Th' inventive evil took such various forms  As fancy scarce could followpausing often  In vacant silence or in speechless anguish  Anon more musical than the lone bird  Who pours her sorrows to the midnight moon  She waked the drowsy night Oft the wild strain  Soar'd ev'n to Heav'nAs oft it died away  Like the uncertain sweetness of that harp  The light breeze softly touches  Abdallah  Thoughts like these  Will undermine the firmness of thy nature  Orasmyn as thou lov'st me shake them off  Thou art the better part of my existence  And when thou droop'st I sink  Orasmyn  At once to see  The flow'r of nature in the morning wither  Ev'n while my senses ached at its perfection  Abdallah  How wisehow gen'rous were those lavish tears  Could sympathy restore the hapless suff'rer  But

minister of my own destruction  Oh I have guiltless cropt creation's rose  And shook its crimson glories to the dust  List not those gracious eyes again to me  Thou soft perfection I no more dare meet

I pray you to the Guadalquiver  turns to the attendants  Plunge plunge me in at once My liver's calcined  Oh find some sudden means to quench this fire  Ere yet my eyestrings crackAway Away  Abdallah is borne off  Almeyda  Yet yet  he  comes notOh no more  these eyes  Shall dwell delighted on their only object  Nor this fond heart pronounce its last adieu  turns and sees Orasmyn's bitter grief  "Take comfort princeTho' small is my own portion  "Yet will I share it with thee For thy sire  "May Heav'n like me forgive him  Orasmyn  "Spotless victim  "His vices have cut short his being here  "But oh thy virtues speak his future fate  ALMEYDA  growing more weak  "Among the many wand'rers on this earth  "Few are allow'd to reach the mortal term  "And of those few scarce one expires content  "The mind's deep agonies exhaust each pow'r  "And early fit the frame for dissolution  "I only feel a numbness" Hark I hear him  Orasmyn  It is thy love Ah happy he to know  The pangs of sorrow only  ALONZO  entering  Blest be Heav'n  Which gives me once again to see Almeyda  And blest be too Orasmyn  ALMEYDA  leaning fondly over him  Tis thyself  My own Alonzoall my soul's fond treasure  "Thus on the dying eyes of  ome lone hermit  "O'erhanging angels pour a flood of glory  "Ev'n till his soul exhales in extasy  Alonzo  Ah why this mournful sweetness In thine eye  The living lustre fades and on thy cheek  Each charm grows wan and hollow  ORASMYN  wringing his hand  Oh Alonzo  No more must we contend for this rich prize  Heav'n claims its ownand we alike must mourn  ALONZO  shaking him off  Prince if  thou'st  done this deed  Almeyda  Oh never think it  Orasmyn's gen'rous heart is virtue's temple  Alonzo dear Alonzo honourlove him  Much wilt thou  owe  him for my mean injustice  I only strove for life till thou wert near  It now evaporates Hardly speech is left me  "I charge ye ne'er with blood defile the tomb  "Which the true tears of both may nobly hallow  And now indeed farewelA

HAMET  advancing  Tremendous moment awful pause of being  When viewing thus the abdicated frame  Where the fond soul had treasur'd all her wishes  How does recoiling Nature feel at once  Her imperfection Yet such scenes alone  Can shew the danger of those cherish'd passions  Which thus can antedate the hour of death  make existence agony  EPILOGUE  To be spoken in a Crier's Gown and with a Bell  OYEZ Oyez Oyez  Whereas on demand it doth plainly appear  That some wicked wagOdso how came I here  What a blund'ring is this One would think I were blind  Here I'm got on  before  when I should be  behind  Rare work there my friends rare storming and fury  No Epilogue's coming tonight I assure you  Sure never poor author like ours has been crost  When meant to be spoken she found it

there I've my fears  Perhaps they'll demand to be tried by their peers  Yet methinks when I view the fair circle around  I'm in hopes they'll not ask for what cannot be found  An Epilogue stol'n cries Old Crusty out yonder  Pointing to the Pit  A fine prize indeed who should steal it I wonder  He surely must be a strange dolt who contested  A bill on Parnassus so often protested  Nay Sirs 'tis a
