Vizard and fair Paint  Wherein he us'd to Ape a Saint  So false Fires may delude our Eyes  And seem like Stars to guild the Skies  Till Reason proves they owe their Birth  To stinking vapours of the Earth  This Hypocrite we here essay  In's proper Colours to display  Whose Yea and Nay in mischief goes  Beyond the Hectors damning Oaths  A Playhouse Beau is not so Gay  As now a Days the Yea and Nay  Whose Wigg in Curles with Powder Drest  Makes him as Wicked as the rest  And seems to Act so very oddly  You'd Swear he's fallen from the Godly  For when he looks the most Precise  He tells you damn'd confounded Lyes  D' Foe c  London  Printed in the YEAR  D' FOE  's Answer to the  Quakers CATECHISM  c  A Quaker is a  Hogshead of Phanaticisme  drawn off to the Lees a  CommonShore  of Heresie into which most extravagant Opinions at last  Disembogue  themselves and  center  the  fagend  of Reformation marked with a  sullen meagrelook  and this Characteristick  Thou  A Fox in a  Lambskin Coat  that retains his  Subtlety  though not his  colour  a  doughbaked  piece of formality that decries  Superstition  yet idolizes  Garbs  and  Phrases  You may know him by his  diminitiveband  that looks like the  Folornehope  of his Shirt crawling out at his Collar for his  purity  consists only in his  Dress  and his Religion is  Not to speak like his Neighbours  His Orignal is as Obscure as the head of  Nile  some refer it to  Behmen  the can  ing Philosophaster of  Germany  Others run his Pedigree higher and say he was  hatcht  when the  degraded Seraphm  first took on him to counterfeit an  Angel of Light  He is a meer Composition of  Contradiction  and  Clownishnessana  with a sew odd  Scruples  of Hypocrisie to give it a  Tincture  Should the Parliament make a Law for Eating he would Starve rather then be Guilty of obeying it and if you would have him do a thing you need only forbid it on Pain of Death He thinks that to be  Religious  one is obliged to be  Uncivil  and flings his Witts over Board to make room for  Inspirations  His Dreams he Intitles Visions and each  Crapicio  of his Fancy must pass for a divine  Revelation  to which he Blasphemously puts a  Probatum est The Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it  The first Article of  this  Creed  is to keep his Hat on which he observs so Religiously as if he thought  vailing Bonnet  to be the Sin against the  Holy Ghost  Titles of Honour he takes for infallible Marks of the Beast and believes the Master of the Ceremonies to be  Antichrist  He would have done rarely in the old  Chaos  before Nature had anked ihings in their places being a profest Enemy to all Order that thinks there's no  pure walking  unless it be with the Heels upwards He bears a Grudge against  Paul  for saying  most noble Festus  and hates the Memory of  Sarah  because she called her Husband  Lord  His Discourses are nothing but a  Rhapsody  of oft repeated  Nonsense  and when he hath darkned your Understanding with a Cloud of infignificant  Babble  he Cry's  Ah Friends mind the Light  He usually begins with  Raving  like  Mahomet  in his  Fallingfit  or the Devil of  Delphose's Priests  that never delivered their Lying  Oracles  but with  extravagant Gestures  and  odd Distortions  of Body  Swear not at all  is his Motto but  Lies  he holds in many cases  Venial  and in  t  o meritorious  when they make for the  Interest of the beloved Seed  or reflect  Scandal  on the  Government  He Cheats worse then a  Longlane Broaker  by pretending to deal  at a word  and the  Hook  whereby he draws in his Customers is a  farfetcht Sigh  and  plainly I tell thee Friend  This troublesome  Insect  for all his  demure Looks  is deservedly suspected to be part of the  Vermine  dropt from the  Beast  a  Puppet of Religion  contrived to amuse the  Rabble  that receives it's Motion from his  Holynesses  invisible Hand behind the Curtain for though the  Jesuite  and he seem Enemies at long run like  East  and  West  they prove the same  Equivocations  being as common with them both as  Curses  to a  Gamester  Ask our  trembling Saint  if he believe the  Resurrection of the Dead  he shall answer  yea  but tell you another time he meant only  an arising from Sin  by  Heaven  and  Hell  he intends no more but several  Scenes  Transacted  within  us  and abuses  holy Scripture  into a mystical  Romance  Each of them averrs  Perfection  Attainable in this Life but herein they differ the  Papist  Acknowledgeth but  one Pope  in the World the Quaker sets up a Pope in  every Individual Breast  to whom all  Scripture  and  Reason  must  Truckle  so that refusing the  Polestar  of Gods Word and the  Churches Compass  he will needs  Steer  by the wandring Motion of a Treacherous  Ignus fatuus  within subject to be  blown any way  and often Extinguisht by the Hurricanes of  Passion  He makes  Self  the Centre whereunto the Lines of all his Actions tend and like a  Hedgehog  wrapt up in his own warm down turn out  Brisles  to all the World besides you can come on no side of him but he  Pricks  and  Bites  and all his  Craggy  and  Inhospitable  He that deals with him has need of more Eyes then  Poets bestow on Argus  for he outvies a  Genoe's  for Subtlety and a  Jew  may come to be an Apprentice with him he loves the  Exchange  though he hates the  Church  and Admires no Preaching so much as  Foxes  For all his peaceable  Sheepish  Countenance he delights in  Contention  and when he is  Thouing a Court  of Justice thinks himself in his proper Element He bawls like an  Oysterwife  at other Folks  Pride  and evidences his own  Humility  onely in defying the  Pedlars Pack Lace Ribbons c  whilest he  sawcily  contemns his  Superiours  and prefers the  Crotchets  of his own  giddy Brain  before the  Decrees of a general Council  He hates  no Whore  so much as her of  Babylon  and ever and anon greatifies  the old Man  with a kind  Greenapron'd Friend  whom he picks up at a  Conventicle  by a  teacherous Touch  of the Hand under pretence of a  pure Salutation  and finding by her  rampant Pulse  and tempting turning up the  Whites  which she pretends to do in  Devotion  that her desires are  at Flood  they retire together for mutual  Edification  He is often  Drunk  but not like his Neighbours  Temporally  for  Sleep  cannot  cure him but the  Fumes  of his spiritual Pride having  Intoxicated  his Head makes his very Soul  Reel  and but his Body into a fit of  Shivering  ye will he not privatly in the company of  Friends  refuse the  refreshing Bottle  provided it be not known in  Gath  nor published amongst the wicked of  Askalon  for he confesseth the use  of the Creature  especially when it comes on  Freecost  to be  exceeding Lawful  He is very curious to be in all things  contrary to the common Mode  that he may be taken notice of for a  singular Man  and having screw'd his Face into a Religious Frame and turn'd his Voice to a  puling sanctimonious Key  he uses it as a  Lowbell  to catch  Larks  or rather such  Owles  as will be  Bubbled  out of their Money merely on the Repute of his  conscientions Dealing  he abominates our  Churches  and sayes very well that  God must be Worshipped every where in Spirit  yet will rather be  knock'd o'th' Head  theu forsake  Bull and Mouth  here it is that he  Glories in Tribulations  In brief a Quaker is a  Cynick  in Religion one that would have  Illnature  translated  Grace  as if the  Holy Spirit  that  pure sweet gentle Dove  did inspire Men with  sullen Humours  and  waspish Disposition  He hates both  Magistracie  and  Ministrie  and never speaks well of  Authority  or  Obedience  but when he is going to lash his  Maid  or his  Apprentices  for though himself have shaken off all  subjection  to Superious yet to his  Domesticks  he is worse then an  Egyptian Taskmaster  and speaks to his  Servants  in a tone as imperious as the  Grand Seigniour  to his  Mutes  he cannot endure Ceremonies or Complements especially where his Belly is concerned and therefore falls to all meat as Gallants do to a Wench or Oysters without saying Grace he is very diligent in his Generationwork and may therefore have many Children but no Heirs for his Issue comes into the World outlaw'd and can no more boast to be born in lawful Wedlock then  the  Kinchencove  of a  Gypsie  got under a Hedge by a strauling  Tinker  he bannes the Banes and i  this Respect only refuses  License  Consummating his Marriage before it is Solemnized for so soon as the Spirit begins to yield to the Rebellion of the  Flesh  and his Bowels Yearn to be Multiplying he and his willing  Doxy  never wait the Parsons Leisure but take each others Word and so to Bed  The Devil that furnishes others with his  Tare  but by Retail deals with the Quaker by Whole sale so many  Heresies  Club to his Generation that 'tis Impossible to say which he Resembles most Sure Satan had a Fancy to present the World with an  Oglio  and therefore here hath Rendevouzed all his Hell bred Errours in  Epitomie  and set down a Catalogue of them in  Shorthand  By his obstinate Zeal to keep his Noddle covered you may guess him a  Mahumetan  that resents nothing so Dishonourable as a bare Head and indeed he hath no more Christinaity in him than a  Turk  His  Good Fryday Looks  speak him a superstitious  Anchorite  his Subtlety and Equivocations would become a  Jesuite  he Names his Children with as little Ceremony as other Folks do their  Whelps  and so far kees pace with the  Anabaptist  but of a sudden he outstrips them and falls in with the Seekers to deny all Ordinances From  Socinus  he steals Arguments against the blessed  Trinity  and learns to disown all Government from  John  of  Leyden  At first he was much against the  CarnalWeapon  but now begins to be Reconciled to Fighting and if you Anger him will rather venture a  Rubbers at fity Cuffs  then  turn the other Cheek to the Smiter He has of  ate so far fallen from his first pretence of Humillity  hat he out strips Handsom  Fielding  or any  Playhouse Bully  for Wig and Vanity  'Tis a prudent Maxime in the Art Military never  o think too Contemptibly of an Enemy Our Grandfathers saw that  Scotchmist Presbytery  rising to bigger then a Mans Hand and yet how Dismally did it in few Years overspread our whole  Horison  Consider but this  Quaking Gang  in it's true Dimensions and the Arts they have to promote their Designs and they will appear more formidable then most of the other Eactions  For First They are a People generally Subtle Frugal Industrious and Wary in their Dealing by which and their large Pretensions to a punctual Honesty they have Ingrossed a grand part of the Nations Trade  Secondly Whereas other Perswasions are divided into distinct Congregations and so have several particular TEACHERS who frequently Broaching different Whimseys Mince them into  subdivisions  whilst some dare not hear  such an one  and others scruple to Communicate with  such a one  though all of a PARTY  The QUAKERS on the contrary though  o two of them scarce agree in all things doe yet generally throughout  England  keep themselves up  n  one intire Body  glewed together with a strict Unity as to  Affection  and  Correspondence  as is  vident by their  Weekly Collections  in every Coun  y continually sent up to  London  where their  common Stock cannot but in so many Years as they have Maintained it be very vast To which add the exact Accompt and  Registry  they every where keep of all their Births and Burials which are likewise duely Transmitted up so that in an Instant they are able to give a near Estimate of their Number and Strength in all the three Nations These and some other  Importants  being duely weighed render this  shivering Sect  not so in considerable as the common  Rabble  Deluded with their specious Pretences are apt to think them 'Tis a good Caution of a Minor Poet  As white Powder discharges without Noise  So may Saintseeming Hypocrites Destroys  Trust not too far the soft Hand sometimes Smites  And Larks are Birds of Prey as well as Kites  To conclude a  Quaker  is a canting thing that Cozens the World by the Purity of his Cloaths a few  Closestool Faces  and whineing Expressions his Life is only a real Lye his Doctrine contrary to all sober Religon and withal so Troublesome that I am grown quite Weary of drawing his Character and cannot but wish him and all his Tribe fairly Embarqu'd for  terra Incognita  of the late found  Isle of Pines  under the Conduct of  Penn  their high  Admiral
