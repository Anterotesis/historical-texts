to you when I sat down to write my defense of Sir  Isaac Newton  and the British Mathematicians I was not a little moved at the treatment you had been pleased to give to one or two of those Great Men whom I am proud to call my Master and whose memories on that account I shall always reverence and honour  But now  you tell me  I may be supposed cool  I am so partly through the length of time that has intervened and partly by considering the severity of the discipline you have undergone It has had I see a marvellous effect upon you One may plainly perceive an alteration notwithstanding your endeavours to conceal it not only in your sentiments  but in your language your behaviour and your very air You no longer breathe that superiority and contempt of all mankind you were wont to shew This change in you has greatly mitigated  the passion  with which I was before  overcome  In this calm and cool state therefore when I reflect upon what is past I am not a little startled at my own audaciousness and presumption in entring the lists against so redoubtable an adversary as the Author of the Minute Philosopher To you likewise I find this presumption of mine appeared so extraordinary that though you are so good as to qualify it by the softer name of  courage you could not but admire it it seemed unaccountable to you till you reflected on my seeming secure in the favour of one part of my readers and the ignorance of the other  Nevertheless you are persuaded there are fair and candid men among the Mathematicians  I likewise am persuaded not only that there are fair and candid men among the Mathematicians but that generally speaking Mathematicians are fair and candid men What should make them otherwise Are their opinions digested into Creeds and Articles and established by Law Has the Publick thought fit to  bestow dignities and large possessions on them which are not to be obtained without embracing those opinions nor to be retained without persevering in them Were even this the Case yet surely there would be found among them fair and candid men I am sure I know many such among another set of men in these very circumstances  Ay but this other set of men you will say have nothing but truth to defend I grant it And I take this to be the case of the Mathematicians likewise They are at least as good reasoners as any other set of men whatsoever and consequently are as likely to know truth when they meet it and have nothing to hinder them from embracing it It is therefore on their judgment not their favour that I depend  But you speak of  the ignorance of the other part of my Readers  Alas Sir of what advantage can that be to me To me  Philalethes  who aim at truth alone who have no interest in deceiving them  Were I indeed the Author of the Minute Philosopher  Had  I any  other end to serve than truth  Were I master of assurance enough to mislead my reader at the instant that I call out to him to mind his way to  desire him to examine while I am misinforming him to throw dust in his eyes and bid him see then undoubtedly much might be done But these are arts I neither need nor practise I content my self with the plain honest way of giving my Reader the best light I can neither misleading him my self nor suffering him to be misled by others With this view it is that I divide my reply into the same number of sections with your defense and confine my sections to the same matter with yours This will indeed make what I have to say somewhat less methodical but then it will enable the Reader more easily to compare us together and to make a more certain decision between us  The taking this method Sir will make it plainly appear that what I aim at is only manifesting the truth and consequently that the reason of my courage in encountering you is my being verily persuaded that I have truth and justice on my side I know and am aware of your superior accomplishments But  Philalethes  is my name And truth will prevail against the pens of men or angels Your vanity has engaged you in a difficulty from which all your abilities shall never extricate you  Verte omnes tete in facies contrahe quicquid  Sive animis sive arte vales  Your arms are wedged in the oak you have presumptuously attempted to rend Your strength is no longer of any use to defend you A woman a child may be too hard for you  II Your second section teaches us  that things obscure are not therefore sacred and that it is no more a crime to canvass and detect unsound principles or false reasonings in Mathematicks than in any other part of Learning  I agree with you I go farther It can never be a crime but on the contrary is highly laudable to canvass and to examine the principles and reasoning made use of in any science whatsoever and that with the utmost freedom and impartiality All ingenuous minds will be pleased with such an examination They will readily consent that the science they profess be brought to the severest and strictest trial Truth can never be hurt by Inquiry Truth loves the light But error falshood and imposture dread and abhor it  III I am much at a loss here You speak of  men who reject that VERY THING in Religion which they admit in human Learning  Do they  admit that Fluxions are  to them  most incomprehensible Mysteries  Do they notwithstanding this concession  believe them to be clear and scientifick  Do they notwithstanding this belief  entertain an implicit faith in the Author of that Method  These things seem hard to reconcile  IV I do not ask Why you chose to defame Mathematicians in the month of  March    Ann Dom  rather than at any time before The only question with me was Whether Vanity or Christianity were the motive to writing the Analyst  Quae relligio aut quae machina belli  I have fully proved there was no Religion no Christianity in it It was partly Vanity partly Machine  V Here I would observe that whoever admires Fluxions must admire them for something of excellence he sees in the Method of Fluxions and consequently cannot justly be said to  yield Faith  to the Inventor of that Method But this whole section seems  to me to be matter of secret history and declamation of the worst sort namely the defamatory  VI More secret history and declamation partly about what no body denies and partly about what no body believes You give us to understand  you have a right to examine Fluxions even though Religion were quite unconcerned and though you had no end to serve but Truth  No body disputes your right of examining but surely no good can be expected from the examination of a Person who has any end to serve but Truth let that end be what it will But pray what is this other end this end different from Truth that you have to serve It looks as if Religion were meant But I hope better things of you a Christian and a Preacher of the Gospel Truth and the Christian Religion are one I profess I am greatly puzzled  I have taken as much pains  to understand this passage as I sincerely believe you  have done to make sense of Sir  Isaac Newton'  s principles  A friend of mine is of opinion the passage has been corrupted either by the transcribers or the printer and bids me for  Religion  read  Promotion Ita legendum censeo  says he  reclamantibus  centum  Tonsonis I am apt to think he is in the right partly because I take him to be a very able Critick and partly because this emendation though considerably differing from the vulgar reading serves to confirm the proof I had before given that your end was neither Truth nor Religion  You tell me I am very angry and refer to page and of my Defense I have looked over those pages to see what signs of anger I have there shown what injury what affront I have there offered you All I can find is that I have proposed to you the example of our Saviour and of St  Paul  I beg your pardon Sir I took you for one of their followers  You will not take upon you to say you know me to be a Minute Philosopher  I am much obliged to you for this tenderness and should be more so if it appeared that you knew so much as one letter of my name But it seems you would not be concerned if others should take me to be such a one You speak of  my spleen against the Clergy  and you tell me  the Minute Philosophers make just such compliments as I do to our Church  Here I apprehend you mistake the compliments I make to yourself and a few of your credulous  friends for compliments to the body of the Clergy I assure you I look upon the body of the Clergy as a body of learned and useful men I know and am known to a great many individuals among them whom I highly esteem and honour I have spoke of some of them in my Defence with singular respect If I laugh at any it is at such as think you do service to the Church in writing the  Analyst  If I dislike any they are such as are perpetually grasping at dominion and riches No wonder I am a Layman If the Clergy obtain more power I shall have less liberty If they will have more wealth I am one of those must pay to it  VII The chief purport of this section seems to be to strengthen the proof you had before given of the infidelity of Mathematicians You had told us in the  Analyst    you were not a stranger to it It was known You were credibly informed  Now you go farther  You make no doubt of it You have seen shrewed signs You have been  VERY  credibly informed  Can any thing be plainer I declare myself fully satisfied with this proof even without the story told you by Mr  Addison  of  a witty man who was an Infidel  because  of  the infidelity of a certain noted Mathematician  Surely this witty man was in jest at least he was no wise man  VIII IX X In these three sections I meet with nothing but declamation The subject of it is  my passion and injustice my railing and raging my rhetorick  and writing  tragedy  your own sincerity and laudable endeavours to do service to mathematical learning the  proper respect  you treat Sir  Isaac Newton  with and the  decency  with which you dissent from him For which last the reader is desired to have recourse to the  Analyst  particularly to the thirtyfirst Query where Sir  Isaac Newton  is plainly charged with writing nonsense  As to my  frightful visions and tragical uproars about the Inquisition and the Gallows  you may laugh at them as much as you please But I have heard of persons hanged and burnt upon as slender evidence as that which you bring against Mathematicians And what has been may be Especially if the wholsome ancient discipline should ever be restored which some persons say is much to be wished I confess I am not of their mind And I hope the body of the  British  Laity see too plainly the use that would be made of such a power ever to trust you Gentlemen with it  Hoc regnum Dea gentibus esse  Si qua fata sinant jam jam tendit{que} fovet{que}  XI You say you heartily abhor an Inquisition in Faith Upon my word you have a great deal of reason You have been a grievous Freethinker in your time I do not mean in Mathematicks only As great a  Bigot  as I am possessed with  the true spirit of an Inquisitor  I assure you I should be very sorry that you and I were at the mercy of some men I could name They seem to me to be singularly well qualify'd to preside in the holy Office and I doubt they would make us confess that something else existed in Nature besides SPIRIT AND IDEAS  XII More declamation about my declaiming and your own Modesty and the  compliment  you pay  to Sir Isaac Newton's Understanding  But Sir I don't like that word  Sophism  It seems not very consistent with the  decency  and  proper respect  you so lately talked of  XIII XIV XV XVI You tell me  The adoration that I pay to Sir  Isaac Newton  you will pay only to truth That I may be an Idolater of whom I please but I have no right to insult and exclaim at other men because they do not adore my Idol That I inveigh against you because you are not guilty of my mean Idolatry  To deify his power  Who from the terror of this arm so late  Doubted his Empire that were low indeed  Now give me leave to ask you a question Do you really and  bona fide  believe that I pay idolatrous worship to Sir  Isaac Newton  that I make him the object of that adoration which you say you will pay only to truth and which I will pay only to the God of truth And this because I apply to Sir  Isaac Newton  a Verse which an inferior Poet applied to  Virgil  Is  adorare vestigia  to be literally taken think you What can be meant by these  vestigia  The mark of his foot in  Crane Court  Or the truths discovered by him If the last to what purpose all this  declamation and ridiculous rant about Idolatry for four sections together  Quo numine laeso  You seem to dislike my professing that  the highest honour I can ever arrive at or even desire is in any the lowest degree to imitate Sir  Isaac Newton  's example  You think  It might have suited better with my appellation of  Philalethes  and been altogether as laudable if my highest ambition had been to discover truth  Why so it is The discovering of truth and his clear candid humane way of making it known to Mankind is the very thing in which I should desire to imitate Sir  Isaac Newton    You say  I speak of it as a sort of crime to think it possible I should ever see farther or go beyond Sir  Isaac Newton  But there are others who think it no crime to desire to know not only beyond Sir  Isaac Newton  but beyond all Mankind  You intimate your self to be one of these Now Sir I am for seeing as much beyond Sir  Isaac Newton  as you can be But first let us see as far as he has done I agree with you in this desire of knowledge make it as unbounded as you please I assure you I think  it no crime The only difference between us is this You seem to think you have this knowledge already I am sensible I have it not  I make no doubt but such a Man as you or one much inferior to you may carry a particular point or many particular points farther than Sir  Isaac Newton  has done But that such a Man as Sir  Isaac Newton  after long consideration of one thing after touching and retouching it at different times for above half a Century after setting it in several various lights after applying it in an infinite number of examples after giving several different demonstrations of it such as had satisfied all the Mathematicians in  Europe  should all this while have taken error for truth and given  Sophisms  for demonstrations and thereby deceived all the world except my dear Friend the Author of the  Minute Philosopher  is what must be very clearly made out before I believe it  Magnis tamen excidis ausis  XVII You begin this section with addressing your self to me in the following manner "I have said and I venture still to  say that a fluxion is incomprehensible That second third and fourth fluxions are yet more incomprehensible That it is not possible to conceive a simple infinitesimal That it is yet less possible to conceive an infinitesimal of an infinitesimal and so onward What have you to say to this" Truly very little Only I don't well comprehend how one incomprehensible can be MORE incomprehensible than another incomprehensible How it can possibly be LESS possible to conceive one thing than to conceive another thing which other thing it is not at all possible to conceive  For clearing up these assertions I have had recourse pursuant to your directions to the fourth section of the Analyst which is the only one relating to fluxions of the three you refer me to But all the satisfaction I there meet with is That  your imagination is very much strained and puzzled  with one thing That  it seems still more difficult to conceive  another thing That a third  seems an obscure mystery  That a fourth  exceeds if you mistake not all human understanding  That  take  another  in what light one pleases the clear conception of it will if you mistake not be found impossible  This to me seems to  amount to thus much The Author of the  Minute Philosopher  cannot comprehend the principles of fluxions Therefore no man living can comprehend them He cannot understand them Therefore they exceed all human understanding A notable proof of my Hypothesis that that Gentleman has too good an opinion of himself and too mean a one of all other men  You go on addressing your self to me  Do you attempt to clear up the notion of a fluxion Nothing like it  Very true nor did I ever undertake it Sir  Isaac Newton  has done it incomparably well to those who are qualified to read his Works and thither I refer you May not I expose your blunders without pretending to explain his doctrine better than he has done it himself  But you tell me  I only assure you upon my bare word from my own experience and that of several others whom I could name that the doctrine of fluxions may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended  Why pray Sir what did you require more  You appealed to the trial of every thinking reader  I am one of your  thinking readers  I have made the  trial  you desired I acquaint you with the result of that  trial  and all the return you make  me is  Can you think I will take your word when I refuse to take your Master's  I appeal to all my thinking readers whether this be civil usage You say you don't understand fluxions I say I do I believe you And yet you won't believe me  This Sir my judgment tells me is all the answer I ought to make to the invitations you so frequently give me upon this head I am sensible it were better to hold so slippery an adversary to the points we have already in hand than before these are settled to go upon new matter Besides I am afraid of incurring the common fate of Sir  Isaac Newton  's interpreters to be less intelligible than my Master I apprehend likewise that let me take ever so much pains to satisfy and oblige you I shall meet with no better usage than when you appealed to me That all the return I am to expect is  Alas I find no sense or reason in what you say  And yet I am so desirous of contributing my assistance towards your laudable design of  putting this controversy in such a light as that every reader may judge thereof  that I think I must run that hazard But I desire it may be remembred that I do not here intend nor indeed think my self at all qualified to write a complete  treatise of Fluxions that being expected from better hands All that you require of me is to shew that the principles of Fluxions may be clearly conceived This therefore is what I shall endeavour to do and in order to render those principles as intelligible as I can I shall make use of the plainest and easiest example possible that I may give my Reader no other trouble than only that of comprehending the principles themselves  The foundation of the Method of Fluxions I take to be contained in the following  POSTULATUM  Mathematical quantities may be described and in describing may be generated or destroyed may increase or decrease by a continued motion  DEFINITIONS  A Mathematical quantity increasing or decreasing by a continued motion is called a flowing quantity  The velocity with which such flowing quantity increases or decreases is called the fluxion of that flowing quantity  A part of such flowing quantity generated in a very small particle of time is called the augment or increment of the flowing quantity if the flowing quantity be increasing or its decrement if the flowing quantity be decreasing  A nascent increment is an increment just beginning to exist from nothing or just beginning to be generated but not yet arrived at any assignable magnitude how small soever An evanescent increment is the same thing as a nascent increment but only considered in a different manner as by a continual diminution becoming less than any assignable quantity and at last vanishing into nothing or ceasing to exist  Explanation of the Postulatum by an example  If a point as  A  move in one direction from  A  to  B  with a continued motion it will describe and generate the right line  AB  And if the same point return from  B  to  A  it will describe and may thereby be supposed to destroy or annihilate the same right Line  AB  The definitions explained by the same example  While the generating point is in motion either way the line described by it is called a flowing line This flowing line perpetually increases while the generating point is moving in the direction  AB  and perpetually decreases while the generating point is moving in the direction  BA  The velocity with which the generating point moves either way or the velocity with which the flowing line increases or decreases is called the fluxion of the flowing line  Ex gr  The velocity of the generating point in  C  is called the fluxion of the flowing line  AC  and the velocity of the generating point in  B  is the fluxion of the flowing line  AB  If in a very small particle of time the generating point move from  C  to  c  or from  c  to  C  the small line  Cc  is in the first case called the increment of the flowing line  AC  and in the second case is called the decrement of the flowing line  Ac  When the generating point in describing the line  AB  is arrived at the point  C  and proceeds from thence towards  B  At the  instant of time that it sets out or departs from the point  C  at that very instant of time an increment begins to be generated or begins to exist which therefore is properly called a nascent increment And as the generating point at that instant of time is supposed to be just setting out and not as yet to have moved to the least imaginable distance from the point  C  nor consequently to have generated the least imaginable increment it is plain that the nascent increment here considered will be less than any quantity that can be assigned  In like manner when the generating point returns back from  c  to  C  in order to annihilate the increment  cC  that increment will continually grow less and less will become less than any assignable quantity and will at last entirely vanish and become nothing by the return of the generating point to the point  C  At that instant of time therefore that the generating point returns to  C  at that very instant I say the increment vanishes and therefore is then properly called an evanescent increment  Behold good Reader the  difficult  the  obscure  the  mysterious  the  incomprehensible  principles of Fluxions I am much mistaken if a little attention do not enable thee clearly  to conceive them When thou hast done this then wilt thou be rightly prepared for understanding the following fundamental proposition upon which Sir  Isaac Newton  has established his Method of Fluxions the whole business of which Method is from the proportion between the Fluxions or between the nascent increments of flowing quantities to determine the proportion between the flowing quantities themselves  vice versa  PROPOSITION  The Fluxions or Velocities of flowing quantities are very nearly as the increments of those flowing quantities generated in very small equal particles of time And they are exactly in the first proportion of the nascent increments or in the last proportion of the evanescent increments  DEMONSTRATION  If the velocities are uniform it is plain that the increments generated in any equal times must be as those velocities  And if the velocities are not uniform but are perpetually changing yet in a very small particle of time their change will be very little and the increments will be very nearly the same as if the velocities were uniform  i e  the increments will be very nearly as the velocities with which they begin to be generated  And as the first ratio of the nascent increments must be the same whether the velocities be uniform or variable it follows that the nascent increments must be exactly as the velocities with which they begin to be generated  Q E D  Here Sir I must beg leave to observe to you that if Sir  Isaac Newton  had proceeded no farther than the first part of this proposition and had contented himself with establishing the proportion between the increments and their velocities very nearly without going to the utmost exactness yet his Method had been no less scientifical and no less demonstrative than it now is Consequently you were very much overseen in charging him and his followers with proceeding blindfold and not knowing what they were doing even though you had succeeded  in proving that his Method did not come up to the rigor of Geometry  To prevent cavils I must farther observe that the third part of this demonstration might easily be put into a more diffusive form and might be deduced step by step from the  Methodus rationum primarum ultimarum  But this at present is no way necessary especially as you admit the proposition to be true All that I have to do therefore is to explain it a little more particularly and this I shall be the more careful in doing because this proportion of nascent or evanescent increments is what I apprehend you are so often pleased to call a proportion between nothings With what justice you do so the Reader may easily judge if he gives himself the trouble of considering what follows  In the first place and above all it is here to be diligently attended to that Sir  Isaac Newton  no where settles or determines the magnitude of nascent or evanescent increments any farther than to say it is less than any finite magnitude On the contrary he expresly declares that their magnitude cannot be assigned or determined Nor indeed has he any occasion to determine their magnitude  but only the proportion between them this being all that is requisite in his Method  Now the proportion between two evanescent increments is easily to be conceived though the absolute magnitude of those increments is utterly imperceptible to the imagination For those increments may be expounded or represented by any two finite quantities bearing the same proportion to one another And as these finite quantities may be clearly conceived the proportion between them may likewise be clearly conceived  i e  the proportion of the evanescent increments may be clearly conceived by this means Of this several examples may be found in Sir  Isaac  's  Methodus rationum primarum ultimarum  and one in imitation of him may be seen in this Letter Sect XXXII  This being premised I come now to illustrate and explain the Proposition to which end I shall make use of the following easy example  Let the right line  AbB  divided into two equal parts in the point  b  revolve about the point  A  and with any continued motion even or uneven remove into the situation  AcC  Then will the points  B  and  b  describe the circular arcs  BC    bc  The velocity of the point  B  will be always double of the velocity of the point  b  The arc  BC  will be double of the arc  bc  And the increment  BD  will be double of the increment  bd  In all this there is no difficulty between us  I say farther The nascent or evanescent increment of the arc  BC  is double of the nascent or evanescent increment of the arc  bc  This you won't understand I explain it thus beginning first with the nascent increments  As soon as the line  AbB  begins to revolve upon the point  A  and thereby begins to depart from the situation  AbB  at that instant of time do the points  B  and  b  begin to generate their several increments And as the velocity of the point  B  is always double of the velocity of the point  b  it is manifest that  the increment of the arc  BC  begins to be generated with twice the velocity that the increment of the arc  bc  begins to be generated with  ie  that the nascent increment of  BC  is generated with twice the velocity that the nascent increment of  bc  is generated with and consequently that the former nascent increment is by this proposition double of the latter nascent increment  To come now to the evanescent increments let us suppose the line  AbB  to have removed into the situation  AdD  very near to  AbB  whereby the increments  BD    bd  have been generated Next let us imagine the line  AbD  to return gradually to its first situation  AbB  and thereby let the increments  BD    bd  grow continually less and less and at last entirely vanish and become nothing Then as the first of these two increments is double of the second and decreases twice as fast as the second it must perpetually bear the same proportion to the second and consequently the last proportion of these two increments their proportion at the instant of evanescence will be the same as at first namely that of to You tell me when they vanish they become nothing I allow it You say to talk of a proportion  between nothings is to talk nonsense I agree with you But their last proportion is not their proportion after they are vanished and are become nothing It is their proportion when they vanish It is the proportion with which they vanish  You will tell me perhaps this is unintelligible I expect it I ask you therefore which vanishes first The increments themselves Or the proportion between them I think Sir even you will not venture to say that the increments vanish before their proportion vanishes or that the proportion vanishes before the increments vanish If so we are agreed thus far that the increments vanish and their proportion vanishes at one and the same instant of time This proportion therefore which vanishes at the same instant of time that the increments vanish is the proportion with which the increments vanish or in other words is the last proportion of the evanescent increments  This I hope will appear sufficiently clear to an attentive Reader But for his farther satisfaction I shall beg leave to lay before him another example  Let the point  A  with a given uniform velocity describe or generate the flowing line  AB  And let the point  D  with a velocity continually increasing describe or generate the flowing line  DE  Also let both points arrive at the line  CF  cutting the two flowing lines at the same instant of time and with velocities exactly equal  Then it is plain that if we take two increments  Ff    Cc  generated in the same particle of time  Ff  will a little exceed  Cc  But if we suppose the generating points to return towards the line  CF  and their respective velocities in every point of the increments  Ff    Cc  to be the very same in returning as they had been before in proceeding from the line  CF  it is manifest that the more the increments are diminished by the gradual return of the generating points towards the line  CF  the nearer will the proportion between them approach to that of a perfect equality This is easily conceived and admits of no dispute  Farther if the generating points be supposed to return exactly to the line  CF  and thereby  by the increments vanish and become nothing the ratio with which the increments vanish into nothing or the last proportion of the evanescent increments will be that of a perfect equality For as during the time that the generating points are returning towards the line  CF  the increments  Ff    Cc  are continually more and more diminished and the velocities with which the increments decrease approach more and more to the ratio of equality so at the instant of time that those points actually arrive at the line  CF  at that same instant the increments entirely vanish and at the very same instant the velocities with which they decrease and in decreasing vanish arrive at the ratio of perfect equality which therefore is the ratio of the velocities with which the increments vanish and consequently by this proposition is the ratio of the evanescent increments  It is to be carefully attended to that the proportion here given as the proportion of the evanescent increments is not their proportion before they vanish For then  Ff  will exceed  Cc  Nor is it their proportion after they have vanished For then they are become nothing and  proportion  But it is their proportion at the instant that they vanish or the proportion with which they vanish  I might observe farther that as the increments do not come to this proportion before they vanish so neither do they vanish before they come to this proportion but at one and the same instant of time they come to this proportion and vanish they vanish and come to this proportion But I am now afraid I have taken up too much of my reader's time in explaining a point sufficiently clear before  XVIII I am not of your opinion that  every reader of common sense may judge as well of the principles of Fluxions as the most profound Mathematician  How well the most profound Mathematician can judge can I think be certainly known to the most profound Mathematician only and I am sure I am not the man Consequently I cannot take upon me to pronounce upon this point with the same assurance and certitude that you seem to do But this I well know that Sir  Isaac Newton  did not write for  every reader of common sense  He wrote for Mathematicians  Nor can I agree with you that  the simple apprehension of a thing defined is not  sometimes at least  made more perfect by any subsequent Progress in Mathematicks  It happened to me and I believe it happens to all or most other Beginners in Geometry that the definitions of an angle of a figure of parallel lines and of proportion all become clearer upon seeing the application of the things defined in different examples than upon only reading and considering those definitions with what care and attention soever  XIX  I will venture to say that  you  have taken as much pains as I sincerely believe any man living  except a late Philosopher of our University  to make  non  sense of Sir  Isaac Newton  's principles  Your success indeed has been equally bad with his But that  is not your fault but your misfortune  I must needs say you have done pretty well considering  you never had a Master in Mathematicks  Neque ego tibi detrahere ausim  Haerentem capiti multa cum laude coronam  XX I find by this Section as well as by the eighteenth that you are perfectly well  acquainted with what may or may not be done  by any progress though ever so great in the Analysis by the best of Mathematicians by the most profound Analyst  Such a man as you one would think might give one a little light into some very strange things I meet with towards the latter end of this section such as  velocity without motion motion without extension magnitude which is neither finite nor infinite a quantity having no magnitude which is yet divisible a figure where there is no space proportion between nothings and a real product from nothing multiplied by something  To me I must own these seem to be  Mysteries  utterly  incomprehensible  but then I take them to be Mysteries of your own making I can find no more sign of them in Sir  Isaac Newton  's writings than of Transubstantiation and some other Mysteries in the New Testament  XXI The Picture you here draw is really a very  ingenious portraiture  but it has no manner of resemblance to Sir  Isaac Newton  I should sooner have taken it for a picture of  Bellarmine  or for a handsome likeness of the Author of the Minute Philosopher drawing up an answer to  Philalethes  A man  driven  to arts and shifts  in order to defend his principles can hardly  take them for true  must  entertain  more than  some doubt thereof  For instance let any man breathing observe  the arts and shifts  you make use of throughout your answer and he will plainly see you are convinced of your being in an error but will not own it  XXII A new way of passing over a thing is never to have done with it The reader will easily judge who  colours  most is most  clamorous    reproaches  most and  reasons  least  XXIII In the fourth section of the Analyst instead of fairly giving Sir  Isaac Newton  's plain easy intelligible definition of a second Fluxion you are pleased to lay down three or four definitions of your own as obscure mysterious and absurd as you can possibly devise  Eripiunt subito nubes coelumque diemque  Lectorum ex oculis  After which  you appeal to the trial of every thinking reader whether the clear Conception of them is not impossible  This I had taken  notice of as a pious art of misleading and confounding your reader instead of instructing him and had put the two following questions to you which I shall here transcribe at large because with another pious art you have thought fit to truncate the one and to leave out the other for particular reasons which I shall by and by lay before the reader Where said I do you find Sir  Isaac Newton  using such expressions as  the velocities of the velocities the second third and fourth velocities the incipient celerity of an incipient celerity the nascent augment of a nascent augment  Is this the true and genuine meaning of the words  fluxionum mutationes magis aut minus celeres    To these two Questions you are sensible it is incumbent upon you to seem to give an answer and you are likewise sensible you have none to give In this  perplexity  it is worthy the observation of a curious reader to see  what arts and shifts a great Genius may be driven to in grappling with an insuperable difficulty  In the first place you curtail my first question cutting off the latter part of it with an  c  By this means you hide from your reader one of your definitions and that the least justifiable of them all namely  the incipient  celerity of an incipient celerity  There's one difficulty cleverly got over  In the next place you entirely cut off my second question In which I find you have two advantages The first is to avoid giving an answer to it The second not to let your reader see Sir  Isaac Newton  's definition which I had inserted into that question  But setting all this aside after you have proposed my question in your own manner what answer do you give to it Do you shew me where Sir  I N  uses such expressions No You don't pretend to it What then Why truly you endeavour to shew by comparing together two independent Passages taken from two different treatises of Sir  I N  that you may justifiably call a second fluxion so and so Be it so Though I think otherwise Yet still this will only shew that a definition of your own may be used but will not shew it to be Sir  Isaac Newton  's definition nor to be equally clear with Sir  Isaac Newton  's definition Therefore the  pious art  I at first mentioned still subsists with the addition of two or three more pious arts to support it as it generally happens when such arts come to be examined into by any of our family of  Philalethes  In order to get out of this  Egyptian  darkness in which you have studiously involved the matter in debate as well as to complete what I had begun in my seventeenth section towards clearing up the first principles of fluxions I shall now endeavour to give my reader and you too Sir if you please a clear and intelligible conception not only of second but of third fourth and fifth fluxions  c ad infinitum  upon the foot of Sir  Isaac Newton  's definition of second fluxions  Adspice nam{que} omnem quae nunc obducta tuenti  Mortales visus hebetat tibi humida circum  Caligat nubem eripiam  That great Man making use of the liberty which has always been allowed to Inventors of giving new names to new conceptions and of defining those names as they thought fit has been pleased to call by the name of fluxion the velocity with which a flowing quantity increases or decreases If this velocity do not always continue the same but undergo any change the velocity of that change is called a fluxion of a fluxion or a second fluxion and as the change is swifter or slower the second fluxion is said to be greater  or less For instance if the first fluxion or velocity of the flowing quantity continually increase the second fluxion is the velocity with which the first velocity increases and is proportional to the momentaneous increase of that first velocity  In like manner the third fluxion is the velocity of the change of the second fluxion the fourth fluxion is the velocity of the change of the third the fifth the velocity of the change of the fourth  c ad infinitum  Here perhaps it may not be amiss to assist the reader's imagination by representing the proportions betwen fluxions of all the several orders in a sensible manner I say their proportions for as I said before Sir  Isaac Newton  makes no enquiry into nor ever considers the absolute magnitude of fluxions or moments or nascent increments but only the proportion between them And this I desire may be carefully remembred  A  a    F    f    F    f    F    f    F    f    Let  A  be a flowing line and let the velocity with which it flows be always represented by the line  F  Then if the line  A  flow uniformly that is if the velocity with which it flows do never change or alter the line  F  will be a constant quantity and the line  A  will have only a first fluxion and no second fluxion But if the line  A  flow with an accelerated velocity that is if the velocity with which it flows do continually increase the line  F  will be a flowing line and the fluxion of this line  F  or the velocity with which that line flows will be the fluxion of the fluxion  F  or the second fluxion of the line  A  Now let the velocity with which this line  F  flows be always represented by the line  F  Then if the line  F  flow uniformly or the velocity with which it flows do never change or alter the line  F  will be a constant quantity and the line  F  will have only a first fluxion and no second fluxion And the Line  A  will have a first and second fluxion but no third Fluxion But if the line  F  flow with an accelerated velocity or the velocity with which it flows do continually increase the line  F  will be a flowing line and the fluxion of this Line  F  or the  velocity with which it flows will be the fluxion of the fluxion  F  or the second fluxion of the fluxion  F  or the third fluxion of the line  A  And this fluxion or velocity may be represented by the line  F  In like manner  F  may represent the first fluxion of  F  the second fluxion of  F  the third fluxion of  F  and the fourth fluxion of the line  A  And it is visible that after this manner we may proceed  ad infinitum  Observing the same analogy let  f  represent the first fluxion of the flowing line  a    f  the first fluxion of  f  or the second fluxion of the line  a    f  the first fluxion of  f  the second fluxion of  f  or the third fluxion of  a    f  the first fluxion of  f  the second fluxion of  f  the third fluxion of  f  or the fourth fluxion of  a  c  ad infinitum  Then is it manifest that the proportion between the first fluxion of  A  and the first fluxion of  a  will be the same as that of the two finite lines  F  and  f  The proportion between the two second fluxions of  A  and  a  will be the same as that of the two finite lines  F  and  f  The proportion between the third fluxions will be that  of the finite lines  F  and  f  The proportion of the fourth fluxions that of  F  and  f  c to infinity  From this methinks it follows that  second    third and fourth fluxions are  not  more incomprehensible than a first fluxion  XXIV XXV XXVI I do not remember to have met with a greater instance of distingenuity and wilful misrepresentation in any controversy I have ever looked into than what the reader will observe to run through these three sections You had in the Analyst charged the Mathematicians with unjustly omitting a certain rectangle in their computation of the increment of the rectangle of two flowing quantities and thereupon had thought fit to represent them as  not proceeding scientifically  as  not seeing their way distinctly  as  proceeding blindfold  as  arriving at the truth they know not how nor by what means  with abundance of the like compliments plentifully dispersed all over the Analyst  To this I had replied First that this omission at the worst could not cause them to deviate from the truth the least imaginable quantity in computing the most immense  magnitude Secondly that as they clearly saw and could plainly demonstrate this insignificancy of the omission they could not justly be said to proceed blindfold Thirdly that this pretended error or omission of theirs was only a blunder of your own  In answer to this you spend three sections in endeavouring to make your reader believe that the main stress of my defence of Sir  Isaac Newton  and his followers is That this error of theirs is  of no significancy in practice  without taking the least notice of the second part of my reply and barely mentioning the third Upon this you declaim very abundantly in the style which the Learned call the tautological  You tell me and it might have been sufficient once to have told me that  the application in gross practice is not the point questioned  I grant it is not Why then have I said so much about the smallness of the error I will even tell you the plain truth Though as you take notice I  live in the university  yet I have been in  London  too and  am  a little  acquainted with the humour of the times and the characters of men  Now Sir I had observed some of those Gentlemen who are not greatly pleased that other Persons should  be possessed of any learning which they themselves have not to be not a little tickled with the rebuke that you had given to the  pride of Mathematicians  I found them curious to know what this discovery was that was like to do so much service to the Church I did my best to give them satisfaction and to let them see the greatness and importance of it They see it plainly and apply the old saying  Parturiunt montes  One of them indeed could make nothing of what I had said about the length of a subtangent or the magnitude of the orb of the fixed stars but was fully satisfied by the information given him by one of his acquaintance to the following effect The Author of the Minute Philosopher has found out that if Sir  Isaac Newton  were to measure the height of St  Paul  's Church by Fluxions he would be out about three quarters of a hair's breadth But yonder is one  Philalethes  at  Cambridge  who pretends that Sir  Isaac  would not be out above the tenth part of a hair's breadth Hearing this and that two books had been written in this controversy the honest Gentleman flew into a great passion and after muttering something to himself about some body's being  overpaid he went on making reflections which I don't care to repeat as not being much for your honour or mine any more than for that of another person whom I too highly reverence to name upon this occasion  XXVII Now gentle Reader we come to the point You are to be shown the first instance of  my courage in affirming with such undoubting assurance things so easily disproved  My antagonist  intreats you to observe how fairly I proceed  I desire you to be upon your guard to look well about you After this if either of us endeavour to throw dust in your eyes knock him down Whichsoever of us shall attempt to falsify the words of Sir  Isaac Newton  or those of his opponent to the Pump to the  Thames  to the  Liffy  with him pump him duck him for a Pickpocket The dispute here is about a matter of fact and I will endeavour to state the case so plainly that it shall be impossible either to mistake or to evade it  In Sir  Isaac Newton  's demonstration of the rule for finding the moment of the rectangle of two flowing quantities mention is made of three several rectangles to each of which the flowing rectangle is equal at  three different times or in three different states  The first of these is the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b    The second is the rectangle  AB  The third is the rectangle  A  +½  a  ×  B  +½  b    I had observed Sir that you were mistaken in taking it for granted that what Sir  Isaac Newton  was endeavouring to find by the suppositions made in this demonstration was the increment of the second of these rectangles the rectangle  AB  The reason I gave for supposing you in a mistake was expressed in the following words "For neither in the demonstration it self nor in any thing preceding or following it is any mention so much as once made of the increment of the rectangle  AB  " This therefore is a matter of fact that you dispute with me But how you dispute it is worth observing It greatly imports you to contradict me and yet you cannot you dare not contradict what I say Notwithstanding this you will contradict me Methinks I see my reader stare I shall be taken for a Madman And yet I speak the words of truth and soberness  I affirm  say you  the direct contrary  Contrary to what To what I  have said No You cannot you dare not do it Your reader would immediately turn to Sir  Isaac Newton  and detect you But you can first alter what I say and then contradict me Instead of my words alone you can give the reader other words which are not mine and yet are so intermixed with mine and distinguished by inverted comma's that every reader shall take them for mine and then you can  affirm the direct contrary  You cannot say Sir  Isaac Newton  makes mention of the increment of the rectangle  AB  But you can affirm that he makes mention of the rectangle  of such flowing quantities  That he makes express mention of the increment of  such rectangle  Of the increment of  that rectangle whose sides have  a  and  b  for their incrementa tota  That he understands his  incrementum  as belonging to the  rectangulum quodvis  You go on declaiming about  the words the sense the context the conclusion of the demonstration  and  the thing to be demonstrated  Involvere diem nubes nox humida coelum  Abstulit  And when the reader has lost all sight of the point in question you  refer it to his own eyes  I refer it to him likewise and reply to all you have here said that the first of the three rectangles mentioned above namely the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  is the rectangle of two flowing quantities but is not the rectangle  AB  is a rectangle whose sides have  a  and  b  for their  incrementa tota  but is not the rectangle  AB  is the  rectangulum quodvis  in its first state but still is not the rectangle  AB  The question is as your self declare about  matter of fact  It is not therefore about what Sir  Isaac Newton  means but what he mentions Not about what he understands but what he declares Not about his sense but his words And in all his words throughout this demonstration and every thing preceding and following it I affirm and aver that he does not so much as once mention the increment of the rectangle  AB  Deny it if you dare  Vim duram vincula capto  Tende Doli circa haec demum frangenturinanes  XXVIII You tell me  I would fain perplex this plain case by distinguishing between an  increment and a moment But it is evident to every one who has any notion of demonstration that the  incrementum  in the conclusion must be the  momentum  in the Lemma and to suppose it otherwise is no credit to the Author  Now Sir to shew you how little I am inclined to  perplex the case  I hereby declare that I absolutely and fully agree with you that the  incrementum  in the conclusion is the  momentum  in the Lemma Let us now see whither this our agreement will lead us  The  momentum  in the Lemma we both agree to be the  momentum  of the rectangle  AB  The  incrementum  in the conclusion is manifestly the excess of the rectangle  A  +½  a  ×  B  +½  b  above the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  ie the increment of the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  Therefore we are agreed that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is the increment of the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  Consequently you were mistaken in supposing that the moment of the rectangle  AB  was the increment of the same rectangle  AB  You quote Sir  Isaac Newton  's words against me to shew that a moment is an increment or decrement Why Sir You make me stare Did not I plainly tell you  in my defence that the moment of  AB  was an increment Did not I likewise tell you what increment it was namely the increment of  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  If you will be pleased to put on your mathematical spectacles or rather to put on the ingenuity of a Scholar and a Gentleman for your eyes are good enough you will plainly see that the distinction I make is not between a moment in general and an increment in general but between a particular moment and a particular increment between the moment of the rectangle  AB  and the increment of the rectangle  AB  ie the excess of the rectangle  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  above the rectangle  AB  Observe me well Sir what I have affirmed and what I still affirm and what before I have done I shall prove past a possibility of being denied is this The moment of  AB  is neither the increment nor the decrement of  AB  neither the excess of  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  above  AB  nor the defect of  A    a  ×  B    b  from  AB  This seems to you  a wonderful  assertion But one of yours which you call a  very plain and easy  one is to me much more wonderful  I asked which of these two quantities the increment of  AB  or the decrement of  AB  you would be pleased to call the moment of  AB  Your answer is  Either of them  This to me is a very wonderful answer for so great and so accurate a Mathematician to make and if I have not quite forgot my Logick I shall draw as wonderful an inference from it The moment of  AB  is equal to the increment of  AB  The same moment of  AB  is equal to the decrement of  AB Ergo  the increment of  AB  is equal to the decrement of  AB  That is  Ab  +  Ba  +  ab  =  Ab  +  Ba    ab  ie  ab  =  o  Therefore the rectangle  ab  about which the Author of the Minute Philosopher has made such a pother is by his own confession equal to nothing  Your example in numbers does by no means come up to our case I shall beg leave to state it a little more pertinently It is agreed that all numbers are either odd or even Upon this you pronounce an unknown number to be even without giving any reason for it I represent to you that since the number is unknown it may as well be odd as even and therefore to pronounce it either the one or the other without any reason for  so doing is no better and no more like an Arithmetician than to toss up cross or pile what you shall call it You may call this mirth if you please but the argument is not the less strong against you for this seeming levity  Nor is the accommodation I proposed in the dispute between an increment and a decrement for the title of moment at all the less reasonable for being delivered in a ludicrous manner under which other persons can plainly discern a serious argument and I perceive you find it much easier to rally than to answer that argument To say truth there is no answer to be given to it it is a demonstration against you as strong as any in  Euclid  that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is a middle arithmetical proportional between the increment and decrement of the same rectangle  AB  If so  Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat  XXIX You are pleased to take notice that  I very candidly represent my case to be that of an Ass between two pottles of hay  I find by this you are duly sensible of my candour Had I been less candid you see plainly I had  a fair occasion of representing another person in that perplexity who might not have had a Ghost so ready at hand to help him out  The question with me was Whether the velocity of the flowing rectangle  AB  was the velocity with which the increment or the velocity with which the decrement of the same rectangle  AB  might be generated I could see no possibility of a reason to determine me either way This led me to fix upon a middle arithmetical proportional between these two velocities for the velocity of the rectangle  AB  As I had before shewn its moment to be a middle arithmetical proportional between the increment and decrement But you who talk so much of reasoning and logick and who set up for the great and sole Master of the  Geometrica are of opinion that either of these velocities may be deemed the velocity  of the rectangle  AB  That is in your opinion of two unequal velocities either the one or the other may be deemed equal to a third velocity or two velocities may be deemed equal and unequal at the same time  You tell me  For your part in the rectangle  AB  considered simply in itself without either increasing or diminishing you can conceive  no velocity at all  Nor I neither But in the rectangle  AB  considered as flowing whether increasing or diminishing I can conceive some velocity or other And if it flow with an accelerated velocity I can conceive that velocity to be different in every point of time And if we suppose the increment of the rectangle to be generated in a given particle of time and the decrement of the same rectangle to be generated in another equal particle of time I can conceive the uniform velocity that would generate the increment in the given time to exceed the uniform velocity that would generate the decrement in the same time And these two velocities being unequal I can conceive an arithmetical mean between them in like manner as I had before supposed an arithmetical mean between the increment and decrement of  AB  which mean is the moment of  AB  And lastly while  AB  flows I can conceive that the first arithmetical mean is constantly proportional to the last  ie  that the velocity of  AB  is proportional to the moment of  AB  Upon my asserting that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is neither the increment nor decrement of that same rectangle  AB  you  tell me this is  in direct opposition to what Sir  Isaac  himself has asserted  in a passage you quote from him and you  bid the reader not believe you but believe his eyes  Now certainly would any reasonable man that did not thoroughly know the Author of the Minute Philosopher conclude that I denied what is expressed in the passage here quoted against me  viz  that moments are either increments or decrements that increments are affirmative moments and decrements are negative moments Little would any one imagine from the assurance with which you here express yourself that all I maintain is as I said a while ago That one particular determined moment is not one particular determined increment But your chicaneries are so many so gross and every way so shameful for a Scholar a Gentleman and above all for one professing piety and christian zeal that I grow weary of exposing and refuting them I solemnly aver that after I have detected so many almost in every paragraph of your Reply I have knowingly and voluntarily passed by many more particularly those scandalous ones of almost perpetually changing the Words I use for others that seem to make more for your advantage One would  think your aim was to shew that whatever care can be used in expression it shall be no fence against such an adversary as you  XXX  You intreat me in the name of Truth to tell what this moment is which is acquired which is lost which is cut in two or distinguished into halves Is it  say you  a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit or nothing at all  You go on to make objections to every one of those senses  If I take it in either of the two former  you say  I contradict Sir  Isaac Newton Very true  If in either of the latter I contradict common sense  Very true again But what then Can I take it in no other sense but those four you propose I assure you I never had a thought of taking it in any one of those senses  But in the name of falshood what is the meaning of this question Would you have me tell you what a Moment is Or what the magnitude of a Moment is If the former I tell you what Sir  Isaac Newton  has told you before a moment is a momentaneous or nascent increment proportional to the velocity of the flowing quantity If the latter I have no business at all to consider  the magnitude of a moment  Princ Lib Lemm  Neque enim spectatur  says Sir  Isaac Newton magnitudo momentorum sed prima nascentium proportio  I may tell you farther that the magnitude of a moment is nothing fixed nor determinate is a quantity perpetually fleeting and altering till it vanishes into nothing in short that it is utterly unassignable  Princ Lib Sect Schol  Dantur ultimae quantitatum evanescentium rationes non dantur ultimae magnitudines  You seem much at a loss to conceive how a nascent increment a quantity just beginning to exist but not yet arrived to any assignable magnitude can be divided or distinguished into two equal parts Now to me there appears no more difficulty in conceiving this than in apprehending how any finite quantity is divided or distinguished into halves For nascent quantities may bear all imaginable proportions to one another as well as finite quantities One example of this I have already given in sect p where the nascent increments  BD    bd  bear to each other the proportion of to and consequently the nascent increment  bd  is equal to one half of the nascent increment  BD  And by dividing the revolving line  AbB  into any other assignable parts it is very easy to conceive what number one pleases of nascent increments bearing any assignable proportions to one another  It is possible you may be so exceedingly scrupulous as to object that though a moment as  bd  is here shewn to be equal to half of another moment  BD  yet still this does not come up to the case of Sir  Isaac Newton's  demonstration where one moment is supposed not only to be double of another as in this case but to be actually divided into two equal parts I am willing to have all possible regard for the tenderness and delicacy of your understanding in conceiving any thing that makes against you and therefore shall readily you give the best assistance I can towards overcoming this difficulty likewise And perhaps it may be most easy to your imagination if we first suppose our moments to be finite quantities and afterwards to become evanescent as Sir  Isaac Newton  generally does and observes to be agreeable to the geometry of the ancients  Let therefore the line  AC  be bisected in the point  B  and at a given instant of time  let a point set out from  A  to describe the line  AC  with any given velocity It is plain this point will arrive at  C  in a given time Let another point at the same given instant of time set out from  B  with one half of the former velocity to describe the line  BC  Then will this second point arrive at  C  in the same given time as the first point will arrive there Now let us suppose the lines  AC    BC  to be gradually destroyed by this motion of their respective describing points  A  and  B  It is manifest that these lines will be to one another as to not only at the first but all the time they are diminishing And as by the approach of the points  A  and  B  to the point  C  these lines will be diminished  sine fine  and will at last vanish into nothing by the actual arrival of those points at  C  the proportion beforesaid of to will still subsist between them to the instant of their evanescence and even at that very instant Here then we have the evanescent line  AB  actually divided into two equal parts as was above proposed For this division does not cease before the line vanishes any more than the line vanishes before the  division ceases The whole line  AC  does not vanish before its half  BC  nor the half  BC  before the whole  AC  But the whole line  AC  and the half line  BC  vanish at one and the same instant of time  I am satisfied that what I have here laid before you in order to assist you in conceiving an evanescent quantity distinguished into two equal parts will be of little use unless I clear up the rest of those  strange conceits if words without a meaning may be called so which  you say  I utter with that extreme satisfaction and complacency  that  unintelligible account in which you find no sense or reason and bid the reader find it if he can  And here I own you have fairly gravelled me I am at a stand at a loss in as great a perplexity as when my hunger was equally divided between the two bottles of hay without seeing any possibility of its being satisfied Oh for a whisper from another Ghost But alas What would even that avail me against a Freethinker in Mathematicks against a man so hardened in infidelity that he will not believe though one should arise from the dead not upon  the word of a Ghost how venerable soever  What then can be done I had I thought  rendered that account as clear as words could make it I had shown not only what a moment was but to prevent as far as possible all mistakes about it I had most carefully and circumspectly shown what it was not Since that account was published I had observed several persons to be greatly satisfied with that paragraph and some to have rectified their notions by it What then can be the reason of this  phaenomenon  that the perspicacious Author of the Minute Philosopher cannot comprehend what every body else so easily understands cannot see what to others appears as clear as the day Is it that he has hurt his sight by poring so long upon objects too small to be discerned as  a triangle in a point  Or has he blinded himself by gazing upon a light too strong for his eyes with endeavouring to find spots in the Sun Or has he crack'd his brain by his meditations upon a science too hard for an  Essay on Vision Sect CLIII to CLIX  Angel Hark Is not that he exclaiming yonder  O thou that with surpassing glory crown'd  Look'st from thy sole dominion like the Author  Of

had not light enough to perceive distinctly his pupil is so dilated as not to be able to distinguish things in open day I was going to say like a Cat that had lost her  Membrana nictitans  But perhaps this comparison though with so sagacious an Animal may give him offence What then shall I say I have it I beg his pardon for these offensive guesses It was my own fault I was not understood by him This comes of saving sixpence to one's reader Had I put a figure in that place all had been right But I was resolved to have none For I knew my Bookseller who understands his business as well as  Jacob Tonson  would not have failed of clapping on the other sixpence to the price of my performance which would have disappointed me in my design of making Truth come cheaper than error But it will be  asked why the want of a figure to that account should be of greater disadvantage to him than to other readers I answer this proceeds from an infirmity that I have long observed in him though every body may not have taken notice of it and though it is as I believe unknown to himself It is that his Ideas are almost all sensible He has few or none of those Ideas which are purely or partly intellectual and which have no sensible images to represent them But of this disease I may perhaps speak more largely another time at present I shall endeavour to obviate this defect in him by the following figure  Let therefore  RALB  or  RL  represent the flowing rectangle  AB  in Sir  Isaac Newton  's  demonstration  RA  the side  A  and  RB  the side  B    ei    iA    Ao  and  ou  each one half of  a  and  bc    cB    Bd  and  df  each one half of  b  and compleat the rectangles  eRbq    iRcr    oRds    uRft    Then will the rectangle  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b  be represented by the rectangle  Rr  the rectangle  A  +½  a  ×  B  +½  b  by the rectangle  Rs  and the difference between these two rectangles or the moment of the rectangle  AB  or  RL  will be represented by the gnomon  rs  lying partly within and partly without the rectangle  RL  The rectangle  A    a  ×  B    b  will be represented by  Rq  and the difference between this rectangle and the rectangle  AB  or the decrement of  AB  will be represented by the gnomon  Lq  lying within the rectangle  RL  Likewise the rectangle  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  will be represented by  Rt  and the difference between this rectangle and the rectangle  AB  or the increment of  AB  will be represented by the gnomon  Lt  lying without the rectangle  RL  Let us now see if by the help of this figure my  unintelligible account  of a moment can be cleared up  First then the moment of the rectangle  AB  or  RL  is neither the increment from  AB  to  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  nor the decrement from  AB  to  A    a  ×  B    b  ie  rs  is neither  Lt  nor  Lq  It is not a moment common to  AB  and  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  which may be considered as the increment of the former or as the decrement of the latter  i e rs  is not  Lt  common to  RL  and  Rt  which may be considered as the increment of  RL  or as the decrement of  Rt  Nor is it a moment common to  AB  and  A    a  ×  B    b  which may be considered as the decrement of the first or as the increment of the last  ie rs  is not  Lq  common to  RL  and  Rq  which may be considered  as the decrement of  RL  or as the increment of  Rq  But it is the moment of the very individual rectangle  AB  itself and peculiar to that only and such as being considered indifferently either as an increment or decrement shall be exactly and perfectly the same  ie rs  is the moment of  RL  and peculiar only to  RL  and if  RL  be considered as an increasing quantity  rs  may be considered as an increment if  RL  be looked upon as decreasing  rs  may be considered as a decrement But whether  rs  be considered as increment or decrement of  RL  it is one and the same quantity  And the way to obtain such a moment  viz  such as being considered either as an increment or decrement of the rectangle  RL  shall be exactly the same such as is not common to  RL  and some other rectangle but peculiar to  RL  only is not to look for a moment lying between  AB  and  A  +  a  ×  B  +  b  ie between  RL  and  Rt  nor to look for one lying between  AB  and  A    a  ×  B    b  ie between  RL  and  Rq  Not to suppose  AB  as lying at either extremity of the moment but as extended to the middle  of it  ie  not to suppose  Lt  to be the moment and  RL  lying at the inner extremity of it nor to suppose  Lq  to be the moment and  RL  lying at the outer extremity of it but to suppose  rs  to be the moment and  RL  extended to the middle of it as having acquired  rL  the one half of the moment and being about to acquire the other half  Ls  or as having lost  Ls  the one half of the moment and being about to lose the other half  Lr  I hope by this time Sir you may have discovered some  sense and reason in what I say  in my account of a moment but if you cannot or will not discover any I flatter myself the reader both will and can And having now a figure before me I shall take the opportunity  of shewing you that there is some  reasoning  couched under what you are pleased to take for  mirth and humour  in the proof that I have given  pag  of my Defence that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is not the increment or decrement of  AB  but a middle arithmetical proportional between them  After proposing to you what by your own confession is the increment and what the decrement of the rectangle  AB  I ask you say  with an intention to puzzle you  which of these you will call the moment of  AB  I supposed it impossible for you to give any answer to that question and therefore I decided it my own way You now say  Either of them  And you call this a  plain and easy answer  My question was What is the moment of the rectangle  RL  You answer  EITHER Lt  or  Lq  I ask again How can I take EITHER  Lt  or  Lq  for the moment of  RL  when  Lt  and  Lq  are unequal If the moment be equal to  Lt  then must  Lq  be less than the moment And if the moment be equal to  Lq  then must  Lt  be greater than the moment Which then must I take for the moment since each of them can never be equal to the moment  All the Answer I can get out of you is  EITHER of them  Things standing thus I offer this argument to your consideration Since according to you I may take  Lt  for the moment of  RL  and since according to you I may likewise take  Lq  for the moment of  RL  it is manifest that according to you I may take  Lt  and  Lq  added together for twice the moment of  RL  Consequently according to you I may take the half of  Lt  and the half of  Lq  added together for the moment of  RL  ie I may take  rs  for the moment of  RL  I hope I may now be allowed to say "Believe me there is no remedy you must acquiesce"  Frustra cerno te tendere contra  I suppose Sir you may now comprehend my meaning when I say that the moment of  AB  is not the increment of  AB  tho' I allow the moment of  AB  to be an increment agreeably to Sir  Isaac Newton  's definition of the word moment But still it is possible you may doubt whether the sense I assign to the word moment be Sir  Isaac Newton  's sense of that term or a new one that  I have affixed to it in opposition to you This is the next point to be cleared up  And here I beg leave to observe in the first place the presumption is strong in my favour that by the moment of  AB  Sir  Isaac  means something different from the increment of  AB  For if these two words signified precisely the same thing it is probable he would have used them indifferently sometimes the one and sometimes the other Whereas the fact is that after he has done with defining his terms he never mentions the word increment but in one place and then he does not speak of the increment of the rectangle  AB  but only of the increment of the rectangle  ie  of the flowing rectangle taken at large But where he names his rectangle or other flowing quantity as  AB    ABC    A      A    c He never mentions the increment of  AB  of  ABC  of  A    c but always the moment of  AB  the moment of  ABC  the moment of  A    of  A    c And when such a writer as Sir  Isaac Newton  chuses constantly to use one term rather than another seemingly of the same signification it is to be presmed he has some reason for so doing  But farther we are to take notice that according to Sir  Isaac Newton  the moment of  a flowing quantity is ever proportional to the velocity of the same flowing quantity Let the velocity and the moment of a flowing quantity vary as they will yet if any instant of time be taken these three things will be given such as they are at that same instant namely the rectangle itself its velocity and its moment And this velocity and moment are always proportional If therefore it shall be shown that the moment of a flowing quantity such as I suppose it is proportional to the velocity of that same flowing quantity it will follow that what I suppose to be the moment is the same with the moment intended by Sir  Isaac Newton  In order therefore to render the conception of this point as easy and as clear as possible I shall once more have recourse to that well known and familiar instance of a flowing quantity I have so often made use of  viz  that of a line described by the motion of a point  Let  x  represent the time in which a flowing line is generated in all the following cases and since time flows uniformly let the constant quantity  ẋ  represent the moment or increment for in this particular case they are both one of the time  x  Case If the velocity of the generating point be uniform the flowing line will be as the time in which it is generated and consequently the line may also be represented by  x  and its moment or increment may be represented by  ẋ  In this case therefore the moment  ẋ  being constant must be proportional to the velocity which is likewise constant  Case Let the velocity be equably accelerated as in the case of a falling body according to  Galileo  's Theory Then will the velocity be as the time and consequently the velocity likewise may be represented by  x  And the flowing line being as the time and velocity jointly that line may be represented by  x    Now the supposed moment of this line  x    is  xẋ  and I say  xẋ  is proportional to  x  the velocity of the flowing line For since  ẋ  is a constant quantity it is evident that  xẋ  is as  x  and  x  is as  x  Therefore  xẋ  is as  x  In this case therefore the supposed moment is as the velocity of the flowing quantity  Case Let the velocity be as the square of the time and be represented by  x    Then will the flowing line still be as the velocity  and the time jointly and consequently may be represented by  x    the supposed moment of which  viz    x    ẋ  is evidently as  x    or as the velocity  Case In general let the velocity be as any power of the time and consequently be represented by  x  ^  n    Then may the flowing line be represented by the time and the velocity jointly or by  x  ×  x  ^  n      ie  by  x  ^  n  And the supposed moment of this line will be  nx  ^  n    ẋ  which is manifestly as  x  ^  n    that is as the velocity  The moment therefore supposed by me is ever proportional to the velocity and consequently is the moment supposed by Sir  Isaac Newton  While I am upon this consideration it may not be amiss for a more compleat illustration of what we have been talking of to consider a little more particularly the second case or that of the flowing quantity  x    answering to the rectangle  AB  of Sir  Isaac Newton  I shall therefore take the liberty of laying before my reader in one view the decrement the moment and the increment of the flowing quantity  x    together with the several velocities that would generate  them respectively with an uniform motion in a given time  The Decrement  Moment  Increment    xẋ    ẋẋ    xẋ    xẋ  +  ẋẋ  Velocity  Velocity  Velocity  x    ẋ    x  x  +  ẋ    Here it appears that as the moment is a middle arithmetical proportional between the decrement and increment so is the velocity of the flowing line or the velocity that would generate the moment in the given time  ẋ  a middle arithmetical proportional between the velocities that would respectively generate the decrement and increment in the same given time And this proportion equally holds whether the moments be evanescent or finite quantities of whatsoever magnitude  Whence I infer that although it were not possible to conceive an evanescent moment divided into two equal parts yet as finite ones may be conceived to be so divided that demonstration of Sir  Isaac Newton  's which you object against will still hold firm and entire by substituting finite moments in the  room of evanescent moments Which is a secret you were not aware of  One more observation and I have done You would have us take the increment of  AB  or in this case the increment of  x    for the moment of  x    that is you would have us take  xẋ  +  ẋẋ  and not  xẋ  for the moment of  x    And yet you allow that the moment of  x    is proportional to the velocity of  x    But the velocity of  x    is  x  and the quantity you give us as the moment namely  xẋ  +  ẋẋ  is not proportional to this velocity  x  Therefore by your own concession that quantity is not the true moment But the quantity that Sir  Isaac Newton  assigns namely  xẋ  has just now been shown to be proportional to  x  the velocity of  x    and therefore is the true moment Now therefore I may safely repeat my question and  ask with my accustomed air  "What say you Sir Is this a just and legitimate reason for Sir  Isaac  's proceeding as he did I think you must acknowledge it to be so"  But hark you Why all this outcry about Ghosts and Visions Pray who first introduced them If I brought in one you might consider it was to a very good purpose  to help my self out or rather to help you out at a dead lift Whereas you had before needlesly introduced an innumerable multitude of  Ghosts of departed quantities  for no other intent or purpose in the world but your own diversion  In consideration of which I hope I may be pardoned for bringing in one more though I can give no better reason for it than that the Apparition runs strongly in my fancy  See where the Phantom comes a sable wand  Before his decent steps Of regal port  But faded splendour wan His flowing hair  Circled with golden Tiar A gorgeous vest  Dyed  Meliboean  from his shoulders broad  Hangs graceful down In sable armour clad  Sable his body but in whitest mail  His sinewy arms refulgent Such the bird  Majestick treads the albent cliffs or wings  The air  Roystonian  Passion dims his face  Thrice chang'd with pale ire envy and despair  His gestures fierce and mad demeanour mark  His form disfigur'd more than can befal  Spirit of happy sort For heavenly minds  From such distempers foul are ever clear  The thought both of lost fame and lasting scorn  Torments him round he throws his baleful eyes  That witness huge affliction and dismay  Mixt with obdurate pride and steadfast hate  And breaking silence horrid thus begins  Fall'n from what height So much the stronger prov'd  He with his  Moments  And till then who knew  The force of these dire arms Yet not for those    Nor what the potent Victor in his rage  Can else inflict do I repent or change    Though chang'd in outward lustre that fixt mind    And high disdain from sense of selfweigh'd merit    That with proud  Newton  rais'd me to contend    And shook his Throne What though the field be lost  All is not lost Th'unconquerable will    And study of revenge immortal hate    And courage never to submit or yield    As at the head of battle still defies him    Undaunted since by Fate the wings of Ganders    And  Sepia  sableblooded cannot fail  So spake th'Apostate Analyst though in pain  Vaunting aloud but rack'd with deep despair  Frowning he ended and his look denounc'd  Desperate revenge and battel dangerous  To less than  Philalethes  when upstood  One next himself in crime in strength superior  Nisroc  of principalities the prime  And to that eminence by merit rais'd  Nisroc  the strongest and the fiercest Spirit  That fought in this bad cause the strongest far  The fiercest once now broken with despair  His trust was with great  Isaac  to be deem'd  A match in strength and rather than be less  Car'd not to be at all Grown humbler now  As one he stood escap'd from cruel fight  Sore toil'd his riven arms to havock hewn  Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail  Clouded his brow deep on his front engraven  Sat meditation silent in his eye  Shone piercing contemplation thought profound  And princely counsel in his face yet shone  Majestick though in ruin Sage he stood  With  Atlantean  shoulders fit to bear  The weight of loftiest Theories His look  Drew audience and attention still as night  Or summer's noontide air while thus he spake  O Prince O Chief of many wronghead Powers    That led th' imbattled  Increments  to War  Under thy conduct and with dreadful blunders    Brainless endanger'd  Newton  's deathless Fame    And put to proof his high Supremacy    By chance upheld or science and that strife  Was not inglorious though th'event was dire  The dire event too well I see and rue    That with sad overthrow and foul defeat  Hath lost thy fame and all this muddy Host  In horrible destruction laid thus low    As far as  Ghosts  and  shadowy Entities  Can perish  The Vision would lead me a great deal farther and I might proceed to relate in  heroick verse the rebuke given by the fallen Chief to this his Associate for pusillanimity in abandoning the noble undertaking  If thou beest he But O how fall'n How chang'd  From him from that sworn Friend whom mutual league  United thoughts and counsels equal hope  And hazard in the glorious Enterprize  Join'd with me once now misery hath join'd  In equal ruin  But I am afraid Sir you begin to be tired Possibly this vision of mine may give you as little pleasure as the Ghosts you introduced some time ago afforded to any of your readers I shall therefore stop here and hope from your known candour that if you chance to spy any inconsistencies or any little marks of vanity in this my vision you will be so just as to consider there are but few visions apparitions dreams or castles built in the air that are not liable to some objection  XXXI It is now so evident even to your self that the moment of the rectangle  AB  is not the increment of the rectangle  AB  that I expect to be complimented upon my  civility in charging you with want of caution only in putting the one for the other You have indeed  replièd    that this charge is as untrue as it is peremptory  But that was in your state of blindness and I forgive you without your asking pardon You say in your justification Sir  Isaac Newton  in the first case of this  Lemma    expresly determines it to be an increment  Yes he determines it to be an increment But an increment of what An increment of  AB  Methinks I see the good old Knight hold up his finger and cry  Cave  It is the increment of  A  ½  a  ×  B  ½  b    You say  take it increment or decrement as you will the objections still lie and the difficulties are equally insuperable  Very true But I will not take it for either increment or decrement and then all difficulties and objections vanish before me  they become nothing  there are no difficulties no objections I meet with nothing in my way but  the Ghosts of departed  difficulties and objections  XXXII Before I proceed to vindicate that assertion of mine which makes the subject of this section I crave leave to observe  that this assertion true or false is no way material to the point in debate between us You were fully answered before I laid down that assertion And all the subterfuges you have since made use of are clearly removed before I vindicate it Why therefore did I make that assertion Dear Sir the true reason is a secret I see plainly it never entered your  Pericranium  any more than that of some other persons much superior to you in this part of science In due time it may come out In the mean while all I shall say is it was made to guard not against present but future objections  Do not mistake me Sir I am not going to excuse that assertion much less to give it up I intend to vindicate it to the last drop of my pen Like  Mackbeth  in blood  I am in ink  Stept in so far that should I wade no more  Returning were as tedious as go o'er  My assertion was That the moment of the rectangle  AB  determined by Sir  Isaac Newton  namely  aB  +  bA  and the increment of the same rectangle determined by your self namely  aB  +  bA  +  ab  are perfectly and exactly equal supposing  a  and  b  to be diminished  ad infinitum  and this by  Lemma    Sect    Libr    Princip  You answer  If  a  and  b  are real quantities then  ab  is something and consequently makes a real difference but if they are nothing then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise and consequently the  momentum  or  incrementum  whether Sir  Isaac  's or mine are in that case nothing at all  By giving this for an answer to my assertion it is plain you have no notion of what Sir  Isaac Newton  means by a quantity being infinitely diminished though he has so fully and clearly explained himself in the  scholium  of that section of the  Principia  which I so often refer you to  Suppose a given line to be gradually diminished during a given time by the continued motion of a point so that at the end of the given time the line would entirely vanish and become nothing Then if the motion of the point and the gradual diminution of the line consequent thereupon be supposed to stop before the expiration of the given time it is plain that the line will not as yet have been diminished  ad infinitum  it will still be something it will be a real  quantity it will be a finite quantity But if the motion go on without stop or stay to the end of the given time it is manifest that the line must be diminished  sine fine sine limite  it must be diminished  ad infinitum  it must vanish it must become nothing The end of this diminution  ad infinitum  the vanishing of the line and its becoming nothing these three must all happen at one and the same instant of time namely at the expiration of the given time So that an instant before the expiration of the given time or before the quantity becomes nothing it cannot truly be said to be actually diminished  ad infinitum  Therefore while  a  and  b  are real quantities they are not yet diminished  ad infinitum  they may be farther diminished And consequently the first part of your answer is quite beside the purpose It tends only to shew that there is a real difference between the moment and increment before the instant of time when I suppose them to become equal that while they are unequal there is a difference between them A great discovery and undoubtedly true  You proceed in your answer  If they  ie a  and  b  are nothing then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise  and consequently the  momentum  or  incrementum  whether Sir  Isaac'  s or mine are in that case nothing at all  This likewise is undoubtedly true But it is so far from contradicting Sir  Isaac Newton  's doctrine that it is perfectly agreeable to it What he says and what I contend for is this  Though so long as  a  and  b  are real quantities their rectangle  ab  is a real quantity and there is a real difference between the two quantities  aB  +  bA  and  aB  +  bA  +  ab  Yet when by a continual diminution  ad infinitum a  and  b  vanish their rectangle  ab  or the difference between the two quantities  aB  +  bA  and  aB  +  bA  +  ab  vanishes likewise and there is no longer any difference left between those quantities  ie  those quantities are equal But you say when  ab  when the difference between these two quantities vanishes the quantities themselves do likewise vanish I agree with you Their difference therefore vanishes when they vanish And they vanish when their difference vanishes Or The quantities themselves and the difference between them vanish at one and the same instant of time  You see I agree perfectly with you that the moment and increment vanish at the same instant that their difference vanishes All I contend for is this That the moment and increment vanish with a ratio of equality and that they do so I am going to demonstrate after Sir  Isaac Newton  's manner  Let the rectangle  AE  represent  xẋ  the moment and let the rectangle  AF  represent  xẋ  +  ẋẋ  the increment of the flowing square  x    I say when  ẋ  vanishes the moment  xẋ  and the increment  xẋ  +  ẋẋ  will vanish with a ratio of equality  DEMONSTRATION  Produce the lines  AD    BE    CF  to the distant points  d    e    f  and draw the right line  def  parallel to  DEF  Then will the  rectangles  AE    AF  be proportional to the rectangles  Ae    Af  Now let  CB  be diminished  ad infinitum  and vanish into nothing by the coincidence of the point  C  with the point  B  At the instant that these points coincide the lines  CFf    BEe  will likewise coincide  ie  the rectangles  Ae    Af  will coincide and become perfectly equal and at the same instant the rectangles  AE    AF  ie the moment and increment will vanish But at the instant that the rectangles  Ae    Af  become equal the rectangles proportional to these  AE  and  AF  must likewise become equal Therefore these rectangles vanish and become equal at one and the same instant of time or vanish with a ratio of equality  QED  I am so desirous of leaving both you Sir and my reader without any scruple upon this point that I cannot content myself with only demonstrating that in fact the thing is as I say unless I likewise shew you by what means it comes to be so The case is this  While  ẋ  is gradually diminished the ratio between the increment and moment is likewise perpetually diminished and tends to a certain limit which it can never pass and can never arrive at till  ẋ  is diminished  ad  infinitum  and vanishes into nothing That limit is equality  Likewise while  ẋ  is gradually diminished the increment and moment are perpetually diminished and tend to a certain limit which they can never arrive at till  ẋ  is diminished  ad infinitum  and vanishes into nothing That limit is nothing  So that the ratio of the increment and moment and the increment and moment do both arrive at their several limits  ie  at equality and at nothing at one and the same instant of time That is the increment and moment become equal and vanish vanish and become equal at the same instant  Methinks Sir you and I are now so far agreed that it is pity there should be any difference between us about the  Lemma  I quoted to you But as it may be of some service to you and may possibly save trouble to us both another time I am willing to take a little farther pains for your information though I greatly fear it will be lost upon you and that you will make no better use of it than you did of the friendly advice I gave you in my last letter to weight very well what Sir  Isaac Newton  says before you censure him For I see my hypothesis about  the cause of your errors still holds good You have too good an opinion of your own understanding to think you can ever be mistaken Else how was it possible for you to say when such a man as Sir  Isaac Newton  was laying down the foundation of the Method of Fluxions  That his very first and fundamental  Lemma  was incompatible with and subversive of the Doctrine of Fluxions That it seemed the most injudicious step that could be taken That it was directly demolishing the very doctrine I would defend  Pray let us see what this  Lemma  is  LEMMA I  Quantitates ut quantitatum rationes quae ad aequalitatem tempore quovis finito constanter tendunt ante finem temporis illius propius ad invicem accedunt quam pro data quavis differentia fiunt ultimo aequales  In this  Lemma  are manifestly contained the following suppositions  That the quantities or ratio's of quantities tend to equality  That this tendency to equality constantly holds during a given time  That they come nearer to equality than to have any assignable difference between them  That they come thus near to equality before the expiration of the given time  Upon these suppositions Sir  Isaac  affirms and demonstrates that the quantities do at last become equal  ie  do become equal at the end of the given time  We come now to see what you object to this you I say who  have long since consulted and considered this  Lemma you who  very much doubt whether I have sufficiently considered this  Lemma  its demonstration and its consequences  you  who have taken as much pains as you sincerely believe any man living to understand that great Author and to make sense of his principles  you  on whose part you assure me no industry nor caution nor attention have been wanting So that if you do not understand him it is not your fault but your misfortune  I am going to take my candle and lanthorn as  Harlequin  did a while ago at  Paris  to look for the complete victory at  Parma  and shall make a diligent search after your industry caution and attention in considering this short  Lemma  It certainly deserves all the caution you can use since  it contains according to Sir  Isaac Newton  the foundation not only of the method of fluxions but of the  Principia  themselves of that book which is the admiration and astonishment of all mankind except the Author of that greater and more stupendous work  The Minute Philosopher  You suppose Sir  Isaac Newton to argue that quantities must be equal because they have no assignable difference  Is this then the only supposition he makes that quantities have no assignable difference Does he not plainly make the first the second and fourth supposition abovementioned as well as the third Are the following words  ad aequalitatem tempore quovis finito constanter tendunt ante finem temporis illius  left out of your copy If not where were your eyes that you overlooked them Or your integrity that you suppressed them Might not the most orthodox Father of the Church or the great Apostle St  Paul  himself be proved an errant Heretick by such a proceeding For shame go and look over that  Lemma  again read it diligently consider it throughly understand it if you can and till you have done so never dare to take the venerable  name of Sir  Isaac Newton  within your lips much less to condemn him  XXXIII We come now to the method for obtaining a rule to find the fluxion of any power of a flowing quantity which is delivered in the introduction to the Quadratures and considered in the Analyst  And here  say you  the question between us is whether I have rightly represented the sense of those words  evanescant jam augmenta illa  in rendering them let the increments vanish  ie  let the increments be nothing or let there be no increments  And so Sir you would have the Reader believe that this is the whole of the question between us That we have each of us spent four or five pages and may possibly spend twice as many more before we have done in wrangling about the translation of four  Latin  words If so methinks his best way will be to let us wrangle by our selves and to translate those four words himself as he thinks fit without ever troubling his head about us  But I take the question between us to be of a little more extent and of somewhat more importance What I have endeavoured to establish the sense of is not those four  words alone but the whole passage taken together  ie  in the style of divines the text and the context The whole passage is  Evanescant jam augmenta illa eorum ratio ultima erit  and I have endeavoured to settle the meaning of this whole passage taken together by comparing it with an equivalent passage but expressed in such terms as not to be liable to any sophistication  Nascantur jam augmenta illa eorum ratio prima erit  The question therefore between us is not barely how those four words may be translated If they stood alone they might be translated twenty different ways But the question is how these four words ought to be translated in conjunction with the other words that follow how the whole passage ought to be translated so as to let the Reader understand the meaning and design of Sir  Isaac Newton  in that passage His design is manifestly to consider the proportion between the evanescent augments or to consider the proportion with which the augments vanish He plainly makes two suppositions in this passage The first is that the augments vanish or become nothing The second that the augments have a last ratio And his business is to determine what this last ratio is Now the question between you  and me is when at what instant of time Sir  Isaac Newton  supposes the augments to have this last ratio You will needs have it that he supposes the augments first to vanish to become nothing and then considers the proportion between those nothings I maintain that he considers the proportion between the augments not after they are vanished but at the instant that they vanish in the very point of evanescence And I am justified by his own words where he more fully explains himself  Schol Sect Libr Princip  intelligendam esse rationem quantitatum non antequam evanescutn NON POSTEA sed quacum evanescunt  You see therefore Sir the hard words you say I have used do not fall upon my Friends but fall where I intended them The blunder of making the quantities first become nothing and then settling the proportion between those nothings stands just as it did It puts me in mind of an Evidence who was instructed to swear that a certain will was made just as the Testator was dying and was therefore subsequent to another will made some time before his death This person resolved to make sure work and swore positively that this was the last will for it was made after the Testator was dead  You see likewise you had no reason to despair of making me acknowledge that vanishing and becoming nothing were equivalent terms with Sir  Isaac Newton  Indeed how was it possible to think otherwise A nascent augment must have been nothing before it began to exist and an evanescent augment must be nothing after it ceases to exist  As it is my business chiefly to keep upon the defensive and I have hitherto had very little occasion to act offensively I did in my first Letter consider your important  Lemma  and reasoning upon it no farther than was necessary to justify Sir  Isaac Newton  against the consequences you draw from that  Lemma  But now as you are pleased to shew more than ordinary arrogance in this and the following section I hope the reader will excuse me if I step out of my way to call you a little to account A vigilant General who is assaulted in his entrenchments by an overbearing and insolent Enemy may sometimes observe that Enemy in the heat of his attack to lay himself so open as to give a fair opportunity of sallying out and chastising him  And it may not be amiss to shew that Mathematicians are not the only persons who  falsely imagine their rational faculties to be more improved than those of other men which have been exercised in a different manner and on different subjects  That there are other persons who  erect themselves into judges and oracles concerning matters  which they have  never  sufficiently  considered nor comprehended  And if this appear it will surely  furnish a fair  argumentum ad hominem  against men who reject that very thing in  Geometry  which they admit in  Logick It will be  a proper way to abate the pride and discredit the pretensions of these  Logicians and Metaphysicians  who insist upon clear Ideas in points of  Mathematicks  if it be shewn that they do without them in their own science  The substance of your  Lemma  is this If one supposition be made and be afterwards destroy'd by a CONTRARY supposition then every thing that followed from the first supposition is destroyed with it This being laid down you proceed thus Sir  Isaac Newton  supposes certain increments to exist or that there are certain increments In consequence of their supposed existence he forms certain expressions of those increments  with intent to deduce the proportion of the increments from those expressions He afterwards supposes that those increments vanish  ie  say you that the increments are nothing that there are no increments  I forbear making any remarks upon your interpretation of the word vanish I admit it to be as you are pleased to make it that the first supposition is there are increments and that the second supposition is there are no increments What do you infer from this The second supposition say you is contrary to the former and destroys the former and in destroying the former it destroys the expressions the proportions and every thing else derived from the former supposition Not too fast good Mr  Logician  If I say the increments now exist and the increments do not now exist the latter assertion will be contrary to the former supposing now to mean the same instant of time in both assertions But if I say at one time the increments now exist and say an hour after the increments do not now exist the latter assertion will neither be contrary nor contradictory to the former because the first now signifies one  time and the second now signifies another time so that both assertions may be true The case therefore in your argument does not come up to your  Lemma  unless you will say Sir  Isaac Newton  supposes that there are increments and that there are no increments at the same instant of time Which is what you have not said and what I hope you will not dare to say  But perhaps you will still maintain that whether the second supposition be esteemed contrary or not contrary to the first yet as the increments which were supposed at first to exist are now supposed not to exist but to be vanished and gone all the consequences of their supposed existence as their expressions proportions  c  must now be supposed to be vanished and gone with them I cannot allow of this neither  Let us imagine your self and me to be debating this matter in an open field at a distance from any shelter and in the middle of a large company of Mathematicians and Logicians A sudden violent rain falls The consequence is we are all wet to the skin Before we can get to covert it clears up and the Sun shines You are for going on with the dispute I desire to be excused I must go home and shift my cloaths and  advise you to do the same You endeavour to persuade me I am not wet The shower say you is vanished and gone and consequently your coldness and wetness and every thing derived from the existence of the shower must have vanished with it I tell you I feel my self cold and wet I take my leave and make haste home I am persuaded the Mathematicians would all take the same course and should think them but very indifferent Logicians that were moved by your arguments to stay behind  Another example may make all clear I know a certain Gentleman who about the first day of  April  was verily persuaded he saw more clearly into the principles of fluxions than Sir  Isaac Newton  had ever done The consequence of this persuasion was that he published a book which immediately convinced all mankind of the contrary He has since had such reasons given him as have entirely altered his opinion His former persuasion is vanished and gone but the book that was the consequence of that persuasion is not vanished and gone with it It would have been much for his credit and for the quiet of the poor Genleman's mind if it had  XXXV You mistake me Sir What I dislike in you is not your  modesty  but your arrogance 'Tis your unparallel'd and amazing insolence to the greatest discoverer of truth of a mere mortal that ever appeared in the world  I am of opinion that  placing the same point in various lights is of great use to explain it  You have not shown Sir Isaac Newton'  s various accounts of fluxions  to be  inconsistent  I find them perfectly consistent and do again profess my self greatly obliged to him for his condescension in setting his doctrine in several different lights without which  I  still  doubt I should never have understood it  But you seem to think it great vanity in me to talk as if I understood the doctrine of Fluxions Why Sir I hope Sir  Isaac Newton  wrote so as to be understood by somebody I have taken pains to understand him and I suppose many others to understand him likewise I prefer my self to no body and I never compare my self with any body but one It is where I speak of such ordinary Proficients in Mathematicks as you and me Even there you see  I have the good manners to place you first Had I said no body understands him but I Or I don't understand him and therefore no body can understand him it were unpardonable vanity  You say I insult you in asking what it is you are offended at who do not still understand him I neither insult you nor blame you for not understanding him But it is I think pretty extraordinary for a man who so often professes not to understand Sir  Isaac Newton  to complain that Sir  Isaac  takes too much pains to explain and illustrate his doctrine by setting it in several different lights As to your request to help you out of the dark I have done my best and hope you see much better than you did The eyewater I have applied might possibly give you some pain but it will do you a power of good  E coelo descendit    XXXVI I flatter my self I have already done to your mind what you here request  XXXVII If I were to say there are a hundred mean and low artifices in a certain pamphlet scarce a section without one or more too scandalous and too trifling to mention  This is plain to me but I will not undertake to demonstrate it to others Is this the same as to say I cannot demonstrate it to others No But it would take up too much of my time it would swell my letter to too great a bulk to demonstrate it You say below I neither  will  nor  can  You make therefore a difference between the meaning of these two words  XXXVIII In this Section you address yourself to me in the following words "You will have it that I represent Sir  Isaac Newton  's conclusions as coming out right because one error is compensated by another contrary and equal error which perhaps he never knew himself nor thought of that by a twofold mistake he arrives though not at Science yet at Truth that he proceeds blindfold  c  All which is untruly said by you who have misapplied to Sir  Isaac Newton  what was intended for the  Marquis de l'Hospital  and his followers" If this was untruly said by me I assure you it was not a wilful untruth You see Mr  Walton  fell into that mistake as well as I And I do not know a single person who has read the Analyst but is in the same  mistake However a mistake it undoubtedly is no body ought in the least to dispute it after a person of your character has made the publick declaration just now recited and has farther assured us that  this double error doth concern the Marquis alone and not Sir  Isaac Newton Far be it from me to call the truth or sincerity of this declaration in question On the contrary I ask your pardon for my mistake and to make you all the satisfaction in my power I do hereby retract recant and abjure my error and abandon my picture my  ingenious portraiture of Sir  Isaac Newton  and  Dame Fortune to the flames If you are not yet satisfied I beg leave to alledge the following reasons in mitigation of my offence  Your discourse seemed to me to be directed to a follower of Sir  Isaac Newton  And as in Sect XX of the Analyst where this affair of the double error begins you perpetually address yourself to him in the second person as  you demonstrate you are conversant you conceive you proceed you apply your conclusions your logick and method  c I too hastily judged that the double error related to this follower and consequently to his master  As this affair is pursued through eleven Sections beginning at Sect XX and ending with Sect XXX I find Sir  Isaac Newton  's way of notation to be used in three of those Sections and the  Marquis  's notation in two I find Sir  Isaac  's language and expression as increments moments fluxions infinitely diminished vanish  c  to be used in nine of those Sections and the  Marquis  's language and expression as differences infinitesimals  c  in seven of those Sections Whence it seemed to me that Sir  Isaac Newton  was as much concerned in this matter as the  Marquis  In one of those Sections namely Sect XXVI you refer to Sect XII and XIII in the first of which Sections  viz  Sect XII I find this Quotation  Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica    lib    lemm  and Sect XIII contains nothing else but your instance of false reasoning taken from Sir  Isaac Newton  's Book of Quadratures Likewise in another of those Sections namely Sect XXVIII I find the same thirteenth Section quoted From all which it seemed to me that Sir  Isaac Newton  was rather more concerned in this affair than the  Marquis    whose works I do not find to be quoted in any of those Sections so much as once  The arguments used in the Analyst seemed to me to bear equally hard against Sir  Isaac Newton  and the  Marquis  so that I could not see how you could condemn the one and acquit the other of either of the two errors  These considerations had so fully possessed my mind that Sir  Isaac Newton  was supposed by you to be guilty of this double error that nothing but my firm persuasion of your veracity and integrity could ever have removed that apprehension I must own I have still one scruple upon my thoughts If you will be so good as to remove that my mind will be perfectly easy about this affair It is this  The first error in giving  xdx  for the difference or  xẋ  for the moment of  xx  is common to the  Marquis  and Sir  Isaac Newton  The  Marquis  makes a second error which perfectly corrects the first whence his conclusion comes out right  Sir  Isaac Newton  makes no second error to correct his first and therefore his conclusion ought to come out wrong  And yet Sir  Isaac  's conclusion comes out exactly right and is the same with the  Marquis  's conclusion The more I consider this the more it puzzles me Possibly for want of the  Philosophia prima  which you are so great a master of  XXXIX As you do not  persist  nay on the contrary desist and entirely disown your accusing Sir  Isaac Newton  of this double error methinks there is now no occasion for my producing any evidence to justify him But you are pleased to  call publickly upon me to produce it  to  deny as strongly as I affirm  to  aver that my declaring I have such evidence is an unquestionable proof of the matchless contempt that I  Philalethes  have for truth  Why this indeed is matchlessBlindness or assurance shall I call it I beg the Reader will turn to  p  of my Defence There he will see I have already produced my evidence and have named the passages where these very objections of yours appear to have been foreseen and to be clearly and fully removed I have there named the passages I say though you have suppressed them and every Reader who is qualified to examine those passages will find what I say to be  true and that the pretence of your first error is fully removed by  Lemma  and that of the second by  Lemma    XL I have nothing to say to the principles of the  Marquis de l'Hospital  I defend nothing but his reasoning You say  he rejects infinitesimals in virtue of a Postulatum and this you venture to call rejecting them without ceremony  I know of no greater ceremony used by  Euclid  than to reject a thing in necessary and unavoidable consequence of a  Postulatum  You tell me  he inferreth a conclusion accurately true contrary to the rules of Logick from inaccurate and false premises  This I deny for if his premises be allowed his conclusion will follow by the strictest rules of  Logick  though those premises are false Allow him his first  postulatum  and then  xdx  will be equal to  xdx  +  dxdx  Allow him his second  Postulatum  and then  RN  in your figure Analyst p will be equal to  RL  And his conclusion must come out right It seems therefore that the  Marquis  is acquitted of this double error as well as Sir  Isaac Newton  and that it is you alone who  have acted blindfold as not knowing the true reason of the conclusion's coming out accurately right which I shew  not  to have  been the effect of a double error  but of his two  Postulata  XLI To all this declamation I shall need to give no other reply than one you furnish me with  p  of this very answer  It must be owned  say you  that after you have misled and amused your less qualified reader▪ as you call him you return to the REAL POINT in controversy and set your self to justify Sir  Isaac'  s method in getting rid of the abovementioned quantity  I think I have already told you that I had talked so much of the smallness of the error only for the information of some great Churchmen to make them sensible of the consequence of your discovery in order to induce them the more readily to join in the hymn to your honour  You say to me  You affirm and indeed what can you not affirm that the difference between the true subtangent and that found without any compensation is absolutely nothing at all  These are not my words You will perhaps affirm that they express my sense I deny it I neither speak thus nor mean thus nor have any meaning like this but the direct contrary with regard to the  subtangent determined without any compensation upon the principles of the  Marquis de l'Hospital  who alone is here referred to  XLII Empty childish declamation  XLIII The same or something worse I apprehend it was as you say  discreetly  done to fix upon two or three of the main points and to  overlook  the rest of the  difficulties proposed in the Analyst  particularly the Queries threescore and seven in number You tell me I am  not afraid nor ashamed to represent the Analysts as very clear and uniform in their conceptions of these matters  Where have I so represented them I know there is a great diversity of opinions among Analysts Some follow  Monsieur Leibnitz  some the  Marquis de l'Hospital  some other writers and some whom I take to be the better judges follow Sir  Isaac Newton  and these are  uniform  so far as they follow their master and  clear  so far as they understand him  XLIV If you have met with all these different opinions in conversation with Analysts in ten months time and some Analysts perhaps or of every one of those opinions  one would think that Country where you have resided for those ten months must be better stocked with Mathematicians than all the rest of  Europe  I hope they are not all  Infidels  If they are it is a mercy they are not very able  Infidels  at least so far as one can judge of them by their mathematical opinions Otherwise I should apprehend Religion to be in great danger there unless that Country be well stocked with men able  to deal with them at their own weapons and to shew they are by no means those masters of reason which they would fain pass for  XLV XLVI XLVII XVIII You come now to the point of Metaphysicks in dispute between us about which you write contrary to your usual manner so very inaccurately and unintelligibly as plainly convinces me  you have some other end to serve than truth  And upon revising what I had before addressed to you upon this subject I think I neither can nor need set that matter in a clearer light than I have already done I perceive likewise my rebukes have had a good effect upon you You make excuses  It was not  you say  with intent to carp or cavil at  a single passage  You talk no more of  manifest staring contradictions  No you express your self with some modesty  all this looks very like a contradiction  with some other signs of grace that give me hopes as you are now made to see your errors you may in time be brought to acknowledge them  It must be owned in your favour you have already recanted the principal of them and that which led to all the rest as amply and fully as from you could possibly be expected You had expressed your self in Art CXXV of your new Theory of Vision in the following words "After reiterated endeavours to apprehend the GENERAL IDEA of a Triangle I have found it altogether incomprehensible" But now  Ut primum discussaeumbrae lux redditamenti  your eyes being opened pardon me this vanity by the arguments I have done my self the honour of laying before you you are pleased to say "This implies that I hold there are no GENERAL IDEAS But I hold the direct contrary that there are INDEED GENERAL IDEAS but not formed by abstraction in the manner set forth by Mr  Locke  "  I am so much pleased with this piece of ingenuity and candid proceeding that for the sake of it I willingly excuse all that follows however inconsistent with this recantation Particularly your making no difference between a round square and a space comprehended by three right lines For the same reason I willingly pass by your supposing that the words of my definition have no ideas or conceptions of the mind joined with them and consequently that the definition has no meaning For to make the definition have a meaning some particular idea simple or compound must be joined to every word used in it and a compound idea made up of all those particular ideas must be joined to and always go along with the whole definition And these two the compound idea and the definition are inseparable if the definition be understood Methinks therefore instead of separating these it were better to make a distinction between this compound idea answering to the definition of a triangle and the image or sensible representation of a triangle two things which I have observed you often to confound both here and in your other writings The compound idea is general but the image if exactly attended  to and adequately perceived by the mind must always be particular  XLIX You here propose some points for the Reader  to reflect  upon  and examine by my light  when you well know I never endeavoured to give him any light about them In this second letter indeed I have at your request endeavoured to explain some part of them But there are some others which I am so far from being able to explain that I never heard of them before and cannot imagine what you mean by them Possibly they may be some  arcana  of the Boeotian Analysis explicable only by the  Philosophia prima  L As these Queries are not proposed to me I leave it to the consideration of my learned Friends of this University whether they deserve or need any answer  I am Sir  Your most Obedient Servant PHILALETHES
