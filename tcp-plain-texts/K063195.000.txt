 DESIGNS c  DESIGNS BY Mr R BENTLEY FOR SIX POEMS BY Mr T GRAY  Frontispiece to first Ode  LONDON Printed for R DODSLEY in Pallmall  MDCCLIII  ODE  _LO where the rosybosom'd Hours  Fair VENUS' train appear  Disclose the longexpecting flowers  And wake the purple year  The Attic warbler pours her throat  Responsive to the cuckow's note  The untaught harmony of spring  While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly  Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky  Their gather'd fragrance fling  Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch  A broader browner shade  Where'er the rude and mossgrown beech  O'ercanopies the glade  Beside some water's rushy brink  With me the Muse shall sit and think  At ease reclin'd in rustic state  How vain the ardour of the Crowd  How low how little are the Proud  How indigent the Great  Still is the toiling hand of Care  The panting herds repose  Yet hark how thro' the peopled air  The busy murmur glows  The insect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honied spring  And float amid the liquid noon  Some lightly o'er the current skim  Some shew their gaylygilded trim  Quickglancing to the sun  To Contemplation's sober eye  Such is the race of Man  And they that creep and they that fly  Shall end where they began  Alike the Busy and the Gay  But flutter thro' life's little day  In fortune's varying colours drest  Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance  Or chill'd by age their airy dance  They leave in dust to rest  Methinks I hear in accents low  The sportive kind reply  Poor moralist and what art thou  A solitary fly  Thy Joys no glittering female meets  No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets  No painted plumage to display  On hasty wings thy youth is flown  Thy sun is set thy spring is gone  We frolick while 'tis May  A FAVORITE HAS NO FRIEND  TG  RB  ODE On the Death of a Favourite CAT Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes  _TWAS on a lofty vase's side  Where China's gayest art had dy'd  The azure flowers that blow  Demurest of the tabby kind  The pensive Selima reclin'd  Gazed on the lake below  Her conscious tail her joy declar'd  The fair round face the snowy beard  The velvet of her paws  Her coat that with the tortoise vies  Her ears of jet and emerald eyes  She saw and purr'd applause  Still had she gaz'd but 'midst the tide  Two angel forms were seen to glide  The Genii of the stream  Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue  Thro' richest purple to the view  Betray'd a golden gleam  The hapless Nymph with wonder saw  A whisker first and then a claw  With many an ardent wish  She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize  What female heart can gold despise  What Cat's averse to fish  Presumptuous Maid with looks intent  Again she stretch'd again she bent  Nor knew the gulf between  Malignant Fate sat by and smil'd  The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd  She tumbled headlong in  Eight times emerging from the flood  She mew'd to ev'ry watry God  Some speedy aid to send  No Dolphin came no Nereid stirr'd  Nor cruel  Tom  or  Susan  heard  A Fav'rite has no friend  From hence ye Beauties undeceiv'd  Know one false step is ne'er retriev'd  And be with caution bold  Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes  And heedless hearts is lawful prize  Nor all that glisters gold  AH TELL THEM THEY ARE MEN  J S Müller sc  ODE On a Distant Prospect of  ETON  COLLEGE  _YE distant spires ye antique towers  That crown the watry glade  Where grateful Science still adores  Her HENRY's holy Shade  And ye that from the stately brow  Of WINDSOR's heights th' expanse below  Of grove of lawn of mead survey  Whose turf whose shade whose flowers among  Wanders the hoary Thames along  His silverwinding way  Ah happy hills ah pleasing shade  Ah fields belov'd in vain  Where once my careless childhood stray'd  A stranger yet to pain  I feel the gales that from ye blow  A momentary bliss bestow  As waving fresh their gladsome wing  My weary soul they seem to sooth  And redolent of joy and youth  To breath a second spring  Say Father THAMES for thou hast seen  Full many a sprightly race  Disporting on thy margent green  The paths of pleasure trace  Who foremost now delight to cleave  With pliant arm thy glassy wave  The captive linnet which enthrall  What idle progeny succeed  To chase the rolling circle's speed  Or urge the flying ball  While some on earnest business bent  Their murm'ring labours ply  'Gainst graver hours that bring constraint  To sweeten liberty  Some bold adventurers disdain  The limits of their little reign  And unknown regions dare descry  Still as they run they look behind  They hear a voice in every wind  And snatch a fearful joy  Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed  Less pleasing when possest  The tear forgot as soon as shed  The sunshine of the breast  Theirs buxom health of rosy hue  Wild wit invention evernew  And lively chear of vigour born  The thoughtless day the easy night  The spirits pure the slumbers light  That fly th' approach of morn  Alas regardless of their doom  The little victims play  No sense have they of ills to come  Nor care beyond today  Yet see how all around 'em wait  The Ministers of human fate  And black Misfortune's baleful train  Ah shew them where in ambush stand  To seize their prey the murth'rous band  Ah tell them they are men  These shall the fury Passions tear  The vulturs of the mind  Disdainful Anger pallid Fear  And Shame that sculks behind  Or pineing Love shall waste their youth  Or Jealousy with rankling tooth  That inly gnaws the secret heart  And Envy wan and faded Care  Grimvisag'd comfortless Despair  And Sorrow's piercing dart  Ambition this shall tempt to rise  Then whirl the wretch from high  To bitter Scorn a sacrifice  And grinning Infamy  The stings of Falshood those shall try  And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye  That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow  And keen Remorse with blood defil'd  And moody Madness laughing wild  Amidst severest woe  Lo in the vale of years beneath  A griesly troop are seen  The painful family of Death  More hideous than their Queen  This racks the joints this fires the veins  That every labouring sinew strains  Those in the deeper vitals rage  Lo Poverty to fill the band  That numbs the soul with icy hand  And slowconsuming Age  To each his suff'rings all are men  Condemn'd alike to groan  The tender for another's pain  Th' unfeeling for his own  Yet ah why should they know their fate  Since sorrow never comes too late  And happiness too swiftly flies  Thought would destroy their paradise  No more where ignorance is bliss  'Tis folly to be wise  J S Müller sc  A LONG STORY  _IN BRITAIN's Isle no matter where  An ancient pile of building stands  The Huntingdons and Hattons there  Employ'd the power of Fairy hands  To raise the cieling's fretted height  Each pannel in achievements cloathing  Rich windows that exclude the light  And passages that lead to nothing  Full oft within the spatious walls  When he had fifty winters o'er him  My grave  Hatton prefer'd by Queen Elizabeth for his graceful Person and fine Dancing  LordKeeper led the Brawls  The Seal and Maces danc'd before him  His bushy beard and shoestrings green  His highcrown'd hat and sattindoublet  Mov'd the stout heart of England's Queen  Tho' Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it  What in the very first beginning  Shame of the versifying tribe  Your Hist'ry whither are you spinning  Can you do nothing but describe  A House there is and that's enough  From whence one fatal morning issues  A brace of Warriors not in buff  But rustling in their silks and tissues  The first came capapee from France  Her conqu'ring destiny fulfilling  Whom meaner Beauties eye askance  And vainly ape her art of killing  The other Amazon kind Heaven  Had arm'd with spirit wit and satire  But COBHAM had the polish given  And tip'd her arrows with goodnature  To celebrate her eyes her air  Coarse panegyricks would but teaze her  Melissa is her Nom de Guerre  Alas who would not wish to please her  With bonnet blue and capucine  And aprons long they hid their armour  And veil'd their weapons bright and keen  In pity to the countryfarmer  Fame in the shape of Mr P  t  By this time all the Parish know it  Had told that thereabouts there lurk'd  A wicked Imp they call a Poet  Who prowl'd the country far and near  Bewitch'd the children of the peasants  Dried up the cows and lam'd the deer  And suck'd the eggs and kill'd the pheasants  My Lady heard their joint petition  Swore by her coronet and ermine  She'd issue out her high commission  To rid the manour of such vermin  The Heroines undertook the task  Thro'lanes unknown o'er stiles they ventur'd  Rap'd at the door nor stay'd to ask  But bounce into the parlour enter'd  The trembling family they daunt  They flirt they sing they laugh they tattle  Rummage his Mother pinch his Aunt  And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle  Each hole and cupboard they explore  Each creek and cranny of his chamber  Run hurryskurry round the floor  And o'er the bed and tester clamber  Into the Drawers and China pry  Papers and books a huge Imbroglio  Under a teacup he might lie  Or creased like dogsears in a folio  On the first marching of the troops  The Muses hopeless of his pardon  Convey'd him underneath their hoops  To a small closet in the garden  So Rumor says Who will believe  But that they left the door ajarr  Where safe and laughing in his sleeve  He heard the distant din of war  Short was his joy He little knew  The power of Magick was no fable  Out of the window whisk they flew  But left a spell upon the table  The words too eager to unriddle  The Poet felt a strange disorder  Transparent birdlime form'd the middle  And chains invisible the border  So cunning was the Apparatus  The powerful pothooks did so move him  That will he nill he to the Greathouse  He went as if the Devil drove him  Yet on his way no sign of grace  For folks in fear are apt to pray  To Phoebus he prefer'd his case  And beg'd his aid that dreadful day  The Godhead would have back'd his quarrel  But with a blush on recollection  Own'd that his quiver and his laurel  'Gainst four such eyes were no protection  The Court was sate the Culprit there  Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping  The Lady  Janes  and  Joans  repair  And from the gallery stand peeping  Such as in silence of the night  Come sweep along some winding entry    The HOUSEKEEPER  Styack  has often seen the sight  Or at the chappeldoor stand sentry  In peaked hoods and mantles tarnish'd  Sour visages enough to scare ye  High Dames of honour once that garnish'd  The drawingroom of fierce Queen Mary  The Peeress comes The Audience stare  And doff their hats with due submission  She curtsies as she takes her chair  To all the People of condition  The Bard with many an artful fib  Had in imagination fenc'd him  Disprov'd the arguments of  Groom of the Chambers  Squib    And all that  The Steward  Groom  could urge against him  But soon his rhetorick forsook him  When he the solemn hall had seen  A sudden fit of ague shook him  He stood as mute as poor  A famous Highwayman hang'd the week before  Macleane  Yet something he was heard to mutter  'How in the park beneath an oldtree  'Without design to hurt the butter  'Or any malice to the poultry  'He once or twice had pen'd a sonnet  'Yet hoped that he might save his bacon  'Numbers would give their oaths upon it  'He ne'er was for a conj'rer taken  The ghostly Prudes with hagged face  Already had condemn'd the sinner  My Lady rose and with a grace  She smiled and bid him come to dinner  'JesuMaria Madam Bridget  'Why what can the Vicountess mean  Cried the square Hoods in woful fidget  'The times are alter'd quite and clean  'Decorum's turn'd to mere civility  'Her air and all her manners shew it  'Commend me to her affability  'Speak to a Commoner and Poet    Here    Stanzas are lost    And so God save our noble King  And guard us from longwinded Lubbers  That to eternity would sing  And keep my Lady from her Rubbers  J S Müller sc  HYMN to ADVERSITY  _DAUGHTER of JOVE relentless Power  Thou Tamer of the human breast  Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour  The Bad affright afflict the Best  Bound in thy adamantine chain  The Proud are taught to taste of pain  And purple Tyrants vainly groan  With pangs unfelt before unpitied and alone  When first thy Sire to send on earth  Virtue his darling Child design'd  To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth  And bad to form her infant mind  Stern rugged Nurse thy rigid lore  With patience many a year she bore  What sorrow was thou bad'st her know  And from her own she learn'd to melt at other's woe  Scared at thy frown terrific fly  Selfpleasing Folly's idle brood  Wild Laughter Noise and thoughtless Joy  And leave us leisure to be good  Light they disperse and with them go  The summer Friend the flatt'ring Foe  By vain Prosperity received  To her they vow their truth and are again believed  Wisdom in sable garb array'd  Immers'd in rapt'rous thought profound  And Melancholy silent maid  With leaden eye that loves the ground  Still on thy solemn steps attend  Warm Charity the gen'ral friend  With Justice to herself severe  And Pity dropping soft the sadlypleasing tear  Oh gently on thy Suppliant's head  Dread Goddess lay thy chast'ning hand  Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad  Nor circled with the vengeful Band  As by the Impious thou art seen  With thund'ring voice and threat'ning mien  With screaming Horror's funeral cry  Despair and fell Disease and ghastly Poverty  Thy form benign oh Goddess wear  Thy milder influence impart  Thy philosophic Train be there  To soften not to wound my heart  The gen'rous spark extinct revive  Teach me to love and to forgive  Exact my own defects to scan  What others are to feel and know myself a Man  C Grignion sculp  C Grignion sculp  ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH YARD  _THE Curfew tolls the knell of parting day  The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea  The plowman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The mopeing owl does to the moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtree's shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep  The breezy call of incensebreathing Morn  The swallow twitt'ring from the strawbuilt shed  The cock's shrill clarion or the ecchoing horn  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy houswife ply her evening care  No children run to lisp their sire's return  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneath their study stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Awaits alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye Proud impute to These the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn isle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze the genial current of the soul  Full many a gem of purest ray serene  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desert air  Some villageHampden that with dauntless breast  The little Tyrant of his fields withstood  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest  Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command  The threats of pain and ruin to despise  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land  And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes  Their lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to dye  For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries  Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely contemplation led  Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded Swain may say  'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  'That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high  'His listless length at noontide wou'd he stretch  'And pore upon the brook that babbles by  'Hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn  'Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove  'Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  'Or craz'd with care or cross'd in hopeless love  'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill  'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree  'Another came nor yet beside the rill  'Nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he  'The next with dirges due in sad array  'Slow thro' the churchway path we saw him born  'Approach and read for thou can'st read the lay  'Grav'd on the stone beneath you aged thorn  The EPITAPH  HERE rests his head upon the lap of Earth  A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own  Large was his bounty and his soul sincere  Heav'n did a recompence as largely send  He gave to Mis'ry all he had a tear  He gain'd from Heav'n 'twas all he wish'd a friend  No farther seek his merits to disclose  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode  There they alike in trembling hope repose  The bosom of his Father and his God  C Grignion sculp
