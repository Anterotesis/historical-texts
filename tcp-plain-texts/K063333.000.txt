Coffeehouses in Town  For the Encouragement of so useful a Work it is thought fit the Publick should be inform'd of the Contents of the First Volume by one who has with great Care perus'd the  Manuscript  THE Author in his Preface makes some very judicious Reflexions upon the Original of Arts and Sciences That at first they consist of scatter'd Theorems and Practices which are handed about amongst the Masters and only reveal'd to the  Filii Artis  till such time as some great Genius appears who Collects these disjointed Propositions and reduces them into a regular System That this is the Case of that Noble and Useful Art of  Political Lying  which in this last Age having been enrich'd with several new Discoveries ought not to lie any longer in Rubbish and Confusion but may justly claim a Place in the  Encyclopedia  especially such as serves for a Model of Education for an able Politcian that he proposes to himself no small Stock of Fame in future Ages in being the first who has undertaken this Design and for the same Reason he hopes the Imperfection of his Work will be excused He invites all Persons who have any Talent that way or any new Discovery to communicate their Thoughts assuring them that honorable mention shall be made of them in his Work  The First Volume consists of Eleven Chapters  In the first Chapter of his excellent Treatise he reasons Philosophically concerning the Nature of the Soul of Man and those Qualities which render it susceptible of Lyes He supposes the Soul to be of the Nature of a  PlanoCylindrical Speculum  or Lookingglass that the plain side was made by God Almighty but that the Devil afterwards wrought the other side into a Cylindrical Figure The plain side represents Objects just as they are and the Cylindrical side by the Rules of Catoptricks must needs represent true Objects false and false Objects true but the Cylindrical side being much the larger Surface takes in a greater Compass of visual Rays That upon the Cylindrical side of the Soul of Man depends the whole Art and Success of  Political Lying  The Author in this Chapter proceeds to reason upon the other Qualities of the Mind As great Fondness of the  Malicious  and the  Miraculous  The Tendency of the Soul towards the  Malicious  springs from Selflove or a Pleasure to find Mankind more wicked base or unfortunate than our selves The Design of the  Miraculous  proceeds from the Inactivity of the Soul or its Incapacity to be moved or delighted with any thing that is vulgar or common The Author having establish'd the Qualities of the  MIND upon which his Art is founded he proceeds  In his Second Chapter to Treat of the Nature of  Political Lying  which he defines to be  The Art of convincing the People of  Salutary Falshoods  for some good End  He calls it an  Art  to distinguish it from that of telling Truth which does not seem to want  Art  but then he would have this understood only as to the Invention because there is indeed more Art necessary to convince the People of a  Salutary  Truth than a  Salutary  Falshood Then he proceeds to prove that there are  Salutary  Falshoods of which he gives a great many Instances both before and after the Revolution and demonstrates plainly that we could not have carried on the War so long without several of those  Salutary  Falshoods He gives Rules to calculate the Value of a  Political Lye  in Pounds Shillings and Pence By  Good  he does not mean that which is absolutely so but what appears so to the Artist which is a sufficient Ground for him to proceed upon and he distinguishes the Good as it commonly is into  Bonum utile dulce honestum  He shews you that there are  Political Lyes  of a mix'd Nature which include all the  Three  in different respects▪ That the  Utile  reigns generally about the  Exchange  the  Dulce  and  Honestum  at the  Westminster  End of the Town One Man spreads  a Lye to sell or Buy Stock to greater Advantage a second because it is honorable to serve his Party and a third because it is sweet to gratify his Revenge Having explain'd the several Terms of his Definition he proceeds  In his Third Chapter to treat of the Lawfulness of  Political Lying  which he deduces from its true and genuine Principles by enquiring into the several Rights that Mankind have to Truth He shews that the People have a Right to private Truth from their Neighbours and oeconomical Truth from their own Family that they should not be abused by their Wives Children and Servants but that they have no Right at all to  Political  Truth That the People may as well all pretend to be Lords of Mannors and possess great Estates as to have Truth told them in Matters of Government The Author with great Judgment states the several Shares of Mankind in this Matter of Truth according to their several Capacities Dignities and Professions and shews you that Children have hardly any share at all in consequence of which they have very seldom any Truth told them It must be own'd that the Author in this Chapter has some seeming Difficulties to answer and explain Texts of Scripture and a Sermon lately Preach'd before Her Majesty at  Windsor  The Fourth Chapter is wholly employed in this Queston  Whether the Right of Coinage of Political Lyes be wholly in the Government  The Author who is a true Friend to  English  Liberty determines in the Negative and answers all the Arguments of the opposite Party with great Acuteness That as the Government of  England  has a Mixture of Democratical in it so the Right of Inventing and Spreading  Political Lyes  is partly in the People and their obstinate Adherence to this just Privilege has been most conspicuous and shin'd with great Lustre of late Years That it happens very often that there is no other Means left to the good People of  England  to pull down a Ministry and Government they are weary of but by exercising this their undoubted Right That abundance of  Political Lying  is a sure sign of true  English  Liberty That as Ministers do sometimes use Tools to support their Power it is but reasonable that the People should employ the same Weapon to defend themselves and pull them down  In his Fifth Chapter he divides  Political Lyes  into their several Species and Classes and gives Precepts about the Inventing Spreading and Propagating the several sorts of them He begins with the  Rumores  and  Libelli famosi  such as concern the Reputation of Men in Power where he finds Fault  with the common Mistake that takes Notice only of one sort  viz  the Detractory or Defamatory whereas in truth there are three sorts the Detractory the Additory and the Translatory The Additory gives to a Great Man a greater share of Reputation than belongs to him to enable him to serve some good End or Purpose The Detractory or Defamatory is a Lye which takes from a Great Man the Reputation that justly belongs to him for fear he should use it to the Detriment of the Publick The Translatory is a Lye that transfers the Merit of a Man's good Action to another who is in himself more deserving or transfers the Demerit of a bad Action from the true Author to a Person who is in himself less deserving He gives several Instances of very great Strokes in all the Three Kinds especially in the last when it was necessary for the Good of the Publick to bestow the Valour and Conduct of one Man upon another and that of many to one Man nay even upon a good Occasion a Man may be rob'd of his Victory by a Person that did not Command in the Action The Restoring and the Destroying the Publick may be ascrib'd to Persons who had no hand in either The Author exhorts all Gentlemen Practitioners to exercise themselves in the Translatory because the Existence of the Things themselves being visible and not demanding any  Proof there wants nothing to be put upon the Publick but a false Author or a false Cause which is no great Presumption upon the Credulity of Mankind to whom the secret Springs of things are for the most part unknown  The Author proceeds to give some Precepts as to the Additory That when one ascribes any thing to a Person which does not belong to him the Lye ought to be calculated not quite contradictory to his known Qualities  Ex gr  One would not make the  French  King present at a Protestant Conventicle nor like Queen  Elizabeth  restore the Overplus of Taxes to her Subjects One would not bring in the  Emperor  giving two Months Pay in Advance to his Troops nor the  Dutch  paying more than their  Quota  One would not make the same Person zealous for a Standing Army and Publick Liberty nor an Atheist support the Church nor a lewd Fellow a Reformer of Manners nor a hotheaded crackbrain'd Coxcomb forward for a Scheme of Moderation But if it is absolutely necessary that a Person is to have some good adventitious Quality given him the Author's Precept is that it should not be done at first in  extremo gradu  For Example They should not make a Covetous Man give away all at once Five thousand Pounds in a charitable generous way Twenty or Thirty Pounds may suffice at first  They should not introduce a Person of remarkable Ingratitude to his Benefactors rewarding a poor Man for some good Office that was done him thirty Years ago but they may allow him to acknowledge a Service to a Person who is capable still to do him another A Man whose personal Courage is suspected is not at first to drive whole Squadrons before him but he may be allow'd the Merit of some Squabble or throwing a Bottle at his Adversary's Head  It will not be allow'd to make a Great Man that is a known Despiser of Religion spend whole Days in his Closet at his Devotion but you may with Safety make him sit out publick Prayers with Decency A Great Man who has never been known willingly to pay a just Debt ought not all of a sudden to be introduc'd making Restitution of Thousands he has cheated let it suffice at first to pay Twenty Pounds to a Friend who has lost his Note  He lays down the same Rules in the Detractory or Defamatory kind that they should not be quite opposite to the Qualities the Persons are supposed to have Thus it will not be found according to the found Rules of  Pseudology  to report of a pious and religious Prince that he neglects his Devotion and would introduce Heresy but you may report of a merciful Prince that he has Pardon'd a Criminal who did not deserve it  You will be unsuccessful if you give out of a Great Man who is remarkable for his Frugality for the Publick that he squanders away the Nation's Money but you may safely relate that he hoards it You must not affirm he took a Bribe but you may freely censure him for being tardy in his Payments Because though neither may be true yet the last is credible the first not Of an openhearted generous Minister you are not to say that he was in an Intrigue to Betray his Country but you may affirm with some Probability that he was in an Intrigue with a Lady He warns all Practitioners to take good heed to these Precepts for want of which many of their Lies of late have prov'd abortive on shortliv'd  In his Sixth Chapter he treats of the  Miraculous  by which he understands any thing that exceeds the common Degrees of Probability In respect of the People it is divided into two sorts the  or the  Terrifying Lyes and Animating or Encouraging Lyes both being extremely useful on their proper Occasions Concerning the  he gives several Rules one of which is that terrible Objects should not be too frequently shewn to the People lest they grow familiar He says it is absolutely necessary that the People of  England  should be frighted with the  French  King and  the  Pretender  once a Year but that the Bears should be chain'd up again till that time Twelvemonth The want of Observing this so necessary a Precept in bringing out the  Rawhead and Bloodybones  upon every trifling Occasion has produc'd great Indifference in the Vulgar of late Years As to the Animating or Encouraging Lyes he gives the following Rules That they should not far exceed the common degrees of Probability and that there should be variety of them and the same Lye not obstinately insisted upon that the Promissory or Prognosticating Lyes should not be upon short Days for fear the Authors should have the Shame and Confusion to see themselves speedily contradicted He examines by these Rules that wellmeant but unfortunate Lye of the Conquest of  France  which continued near twenty Years together but at last by being too obstinately insisted upon it was worn threadbare and became unsuccessful  As to the  or the  Prodigious  he has little to advise but that their Comets Whales and Dragons should be sizable their Storms Tempests and Earthquakes without the reach of a Days Journey of a Man and a Horse  The Seventh Chapter is wholly taken up in an Enquiry Which of the two Parties are the greatest Artists in  Political Lying  He  owns the  Tories  have been better believed of late but that the  Whigs  have much the greater Genius's amongst them He attributes the late ill Success of the  WhigParty  to their glutting the Market and retailing too much of a bad Commodity at once When there is too great a Quantity of Worms it is hard to catch Gudgeons He proposes a Scheme for the Recovery of the Credit of the  WhigParty  which indeed seems to be somewhat Chimerical and does not savour of that sound Judgment the Author has shown in the rest of the Work It amounts to this That the Party should agree to vent nothing but Truth for three Months together which will give them Credit for six Months Lying afterwards He owns that he believes it almost impossible to find fit Persons to execute this Scheme Towards the end of the Chapter he inveighs severely against the Folly of Parties in retaining such Scoundrels and Men of Low Genius's to retail their Lyes such as most of the present NewsWriters are who besides a strong Bent and Inclination towards the Profession seem to be wholly ignorant in the Rules of  Pseudology  and not at all qualified for so weighty a Trust  In his Eighth Chapter he treats of some extraordinary Genius's who have appear'd of late Years especially in their Disposition towards  the  Miraculous  He advises those hopeful Youngmen to turn their Invention to the Service of their Country it being inglorious at this time to employ their Talent in prodigious FoxChases HorseCourses Feats of Activity in Driving of Coaches Jumping Running Swallowing of Peaches Pulling out whole Sets of Teeth to clean  c  when their Country stands so much in need of their Assistance  The Eighth Chapter is a Project for Uniting the several smaller Corporations of Lyars into one Society It is too tedious to give a full Account of the whole Scheme what is most remarkable is That this Society ought to consist of the Heads of each Party that no Lye is to pass current without their Approbation they being the best Judges of the present Exigencies and what sort of Lyes are demanded That in such a Corporation there ought to be Men of all Professions that the  and the  that is  Decency  and  Probability  may be observ'd as much as possible That besides the Persons abovementioned this Society ought to consist of the hopeful Genius's about the Town of which there are great plenty to be pick'd up in the several Coffeehouses Travellers Virtuoso's Foxhunters Jockeys Attorneys Old Seamen and Soldiers out of the Hospitals of  Greenwich  and  Chelsea  To this Society  so Constituted ought to be committed the sole Management of  Lying  That in their outer Room there ought always to attend some Persons endow'd with a great Stock of Credulity a Generation that thrives mightily in this Soil and Climate He thinks a sufficient Number of them may be pick'd up any where about the  Exchange  These are to Circulate what the other Coin for no Man spreads a Lye with so good a Grace as he that believes it That the Rule of the Society be to invent a Lye and sometimes two for every Day in the Choice of which great Regard ought to be had to the Weather and the Season of the Year Your  or  Terrifying Lyes  do mighty well in  November  and  December  but not so well in  May  and  June  unless the Easterly Winds reign That it ought to be Penal for any body to talk of any thing but the Lye of the Day That the Society is to maintain a sufficient Number of Spies at Court and other Places to furnish Hints and Topicks for Invention and a general Correspondence in all the MarketTowns for Circulating their Lyes That if any one of die Society were observ'd to blush or look out of Countenance or want a necessary Circumstance in telling the Lye he ought to be expell'd and declar'd incapable Besides the Roaring Lies there ought to be a private Committee for Whispers constituted of the ablest Men of  the Society Here the Author makes a Digression in Praise of the  WhigParty  for the right Understanding and Use of  ProofLyes  A  ProofLye  is like a ProofCharge for a Piece of Ordnance to try a StandardCredulity Of such a nature he takes Transubstantiation to be in the Church of  Rome  a ProofArticle which if any one swallows they are sure he will digest every thing else Therefore the  WhigParty  do wisely to try the Credulity of the People sometimes by  Swingers  that they may be able to judge to what heighth they may Charge them afterwards Towards the End of this Chapter he warns the Heads of Parties against Believing their own Lyes which has prov'd of pernicious Consequence of late both a Wise Party and a Wise Nation having regulated their Affairs upon Lyes of their own Invention The Causes of this he supposes to be too great a Zeal and Intenseness in the Practice of this  Art  and a vehement Heat in mutual Conversation whereby they perswade one another that what they wish and report to be true is really so That all Parties have been subject to this Misfortune The  Jacobites  have been constantly infested with it but the  Whigs  of late seem ev'n to exceed them in this ill Habit and Weakness To this Chapter the Author subjoins a Calendar of Lyes proper for the several Months of the Year  The Ninth Chapter treats of the Celerity and Duration of Lyes As to the Celerity of their Motion the Author says it is almost incredible He gives several Instances of Lyes that have gone faster than a Man can ride Post Your  Terrifying Lyes  travel at a prodigious rate above ten Miles an hour your Whispers move in a narrow Vortex but very swiftly The Author says it is impossible to explain several  Phoenomena  in relation to the Celerity of Lyes without the Supposition of  Synchronism  and  Combination  As to the Duration of Lyes he says they are of all sorts from Hours and Days to Ages that there are some which like your Insects die and revive again in a different Form that good Artists like People who build upon a short Lease will calculate the Duration of a Lye surely to answer their purpose to last just as long and no longer than the Turn is serv'd  The Tenth Chapter treats of the Characteristicks of Lyes how to know when where and by whom invented Your  Dutch English  and  French  Ware are amply distinguish'd from one another an  ExchangeLye  from one Coin'd at the other End of the Town Great Judgment is to be shewn as to the Place where the Species is intended to Circulate Very low and base Coin will serve for  Wapping  There are several Coffeehouses  that have their particular Stamps which a judicious Practitioner may easily know All your Great Men have their proper  Phantateusticks  The Author says he has attained by Study and Application to so great Skill in this Matter that bring him any Lye he can tell whose Image it bears so truly as the Great Man himself shall not have the face to deny it The Promissory Lyes of Great Men are known by Shouldering Hugging Squeezing Smiling Bowing and Lyes in Matter of Fact by immoderate Swearing  He spends the whole Eleventh Chapter on one simple Question  Whether a Lye is best contradicted by Truth or another Lye  The Author says that considering the large Extent of the Cylindrical Surface of the Soul and the great Propensity to believe Lyes in the generality of Mankind of late Years he thinks the properest Contradiction to a Lye is another Lye For Example If it should be reported that the Pretender was at  London  one would not contradict it by saying he never was in  England  but you must prove by Eyewitnesses that he came no farther than  Greenwich  but then went back again Thus if it be spread about that a great Person were dying of some Disease you must not say the Truth that they are in Health and never had such a Disease but that they are slowly recovering of it So there was  not long ago a Gentleman who affirmed That the Treaty with  France  for bringing in Popery and Slavery into  England  was Sign'd the th of  September  to which another answered very judiciously not by opposing Truth to his Lye That there was no such Treaty but that to his certain Knowledge there were many things in that Treaty not yet adjusted  The Account of the Second Volume of this Excellent
