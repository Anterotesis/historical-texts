Establish'd for ever more  By  ISAAC BICKERSTAFFE  Esq  LONDON  Printed for  J Morphew  near  StationersHall  THE Famous Prophesie OF THE  White King  and the  Dead Man  c  IT will be necessary to inform the Reader that this  Prophesie  was writ  seven hundred  Years ago in  Latin  and found about  a hundred  Years since at the pulling down of an old  Monastry  All  e parts of this  Prophesie  are already come to pass  t this last which you will find by the sequel is  w at hand The first thing that was foretold by  was the  Union  of the two  Crowns  under one  Mo  rch  after the Death of the  Maiden Queen  the ext thing was the Troubles of  England  and the  eath of King  Charles  the  Martyr  the third thing  as the  Exile  and the fourth the  Restauration  of  ing  Charles  the Second after that this  Prophesie  mes to the late  Revolution  and describes it by  Eagle  coming out of the  East  landing in the  South  nd coming to the  West  where at an old Castle that ands by the River side that washes the Walls of  Briain  's Metropolis the Great and Mighty Men of the  ingdom shall come to receive him and offer him their  ervice to catch the Old  Lyon  's Whelp the last Pro  hesie that shall come to pass is just succeeding the time  at  England  and  Scotland  shall lose their former  Names and be swallow'd up in that of  Great Britai  and then shall be explain'd this of the  White King  a  the  Dead Man  The  White King  and his Character  He is th  great Red Dragon who is gorg'd and ready to burst wit the Blood of all Nations He is known by the mightiness of his Power and the absoluteness of his Dominion The best of his Subjects are the greatest of his Slaves and his most applauded Acts of Devotion consist in th Multitude of Victims be has Sacrificed to the false God that he Worshippeth His Honour is lodged in the numberless Number of his Troops His Religion in th Breast of his Confessor and his Riches in the Purs  of his Subjects  which like the Unjust Steward h useth at his own  Will and Pleasure  This  White King  you may plainly see by th Description is meant for the  French  King who ha been so long foretold to be a  Tyrant  over his People and a  Scourge  to the Neighbouring Nations as th  Prophets  of old deliver'd in dark Misteries thei  Prophesies  concerning the coming of  Cyrus  the downfall of the  Persian Monarchy  under  Darius  and th  rise of the  Western  under  Alexander  and afterwards that of the  Caesars  Can any thing point plainer at him than to say  He is gorg'd with the Blood of all Nations  when there is scarce one in  Europe  whom the  French  King has not imbrued his Hands in their Blood The next is as plain which points at Power and the Arbitrariness of his Government▪ and wherein he has made the best of his Subjects▪ which are the  Protestants  without whose assistance he had scarce been able to have kept his Crown now  Slaves  by sending several to the  Gallies  and forcing  others to quit his Dominions The rest of the  Prophesie  is as true in every particular and therefore needless to repeat  The Time when the  White King  shall raise the  Dead Man  and the Signs of his  Coming  The Time when this shall come to pass shall be the time after  England  and  Scotland  shall lose the Distinction of their former Names and be swallow'd up in their Original Name of  Great Britain  And the Sign that shall be given shall be that when  False Prophets  arise and shall pretend to raise the  Dead Man  but this shall not be the  Dead Man  which the  White King  shall raise for he is not a  Dead Man  but to the Hopes and Expectations of the People he is Dead only but shall rise again  This is directly hit at the  Union  of the Two Kingdoms and cannot be interpreted to mean any  ther thing but what the  Dead Man  is wou'd look  little doubtful but the next  Paragraph  explains it which if it did not the present times wou'd show that it has brought him to Life which every Body thought was  Dead  to us at least but that  hich is very particular and wonderfully remarkable in deed is the Sign given us of those times that is when  False Prophets  shall arise and pretend to aise the  Dead Man  before ever the other  Dead Man  hat was meant was ever thought to make such a  Resurrection  This is worth a serious Reflection to hink that just at a time when these  False Prophets  pretend to raise  Emes  one of their pretended  Probets  which is their  Dead Man  the  White King  in he  Prophesie  is pretending to raise to us the People of the  Union  another  Dead Man  contrary to all our Thoughts our Apprehensions or Expectations  and who this  Dead Man  is the next Paragraph of the  Prophesie  shows  And the  Dead Man  is the  Lyon  's  Whelp  which the  Eagle  had drove away from the  Old Lyon  before  This part of the  Prophesie  is explain'd by that which foretold the  Revolution  by the coming of an  Eagle  out of the  East  which was the then Prince of  Orange  afterwards our Glorious  Restorer  King  William  who came to catch the  Old Lyon  's  Whelp  which may be plainly understood of the then  Pretended Prince  of  Wales  who is afterwards all along call'd the  Dead Man  which very emphatically shows us He is a Person  Dead  and lost to all Reasonable Expectation But this is the  Dead Man  which the  Eagle  had drove away from the  Old Lyon  as this  Pretender  was driven from K  James  before he  Abdicated  the Crown of  England  and therefore he is a  Dead Man  indeed that is excluded all hopes of Reigning by the Crown of  Great Britain  's being Settled on the House of  Hannover  and in a  Protestant Succession  for ever so that he is actually  Dead  to the Law Therefore we shall proceed to examine in the next place  The Business that the  Dead Man  is sent about by the  White King And the  White King  having War with all the Nations round about him setting up one King and pulling down another at last raises up the  Dead Man  which was the  Old Lyon  's  Whelp  and furnishes him with Wooden Horses to carry him to his Native Country there to assault it and destroy the People for the hardness of their Hearts and their Infidelity in not beliening that the  Dead Man  shou'd come again whom they spued out from amongst them long before  This is the design the  Dead Man  is sent about  y the  White King  but his Governour has disappoin  d all his Projects  This Paragraph needs but little explaining at his time of Day when we find the  White King▪  is  etting up the  Dead Man  against us and sending  im to execute his own Designs The  Wooden Hor  s  he is preparing for him to Visit the Land of his Nativity are the  White King  's  Shipping  wherewith he threatens to Invade us and Force the Subjects of a Free State and who Live under the happiest Government in the World to bow their Necks down to a Foreign Yoke of Slavery under Pretence of a Person and Title that is absolutely  Dead  to us and all the World beside this  White King  this Scourge of the Nations which as the  Prophesie  says  Is for setting up one King and pulling down another  But  n the last place this  Dead Man  shall bring a Governour along with him now who this Governour is will be worth while to enquire because this Governour shall break the Neck of all his Designs in a manner that shall be acceptable to all the World as the Prophesie further illustrates when it comes to the Destruction of the  White King  and the  Dead Man  And this Governour seems to be directly level'd at the Duke of  Berwick  who shall discover all the Underhand Projects of the  White King  to make a  Property  of the  Dead Man  and so shall deliver up the  Dead Man  that he may be no more a Disturber of the People or a Handle for the  White King  to work all his dark Designs withal  And the  Dead Man  's Governour shall bring over his Charge and then the  White King  shall leave the  Dead Man  to the Charge of his Governour and there sha  Consternation and Confusion and Amazement but the B  of the People shall not be spilt nor shall Desolation or Des▪ction come near their Houses for the Governour of the  D Man  shall deliver up his Charge to the Hands of them that quire it of him and he shall be Crown'd with Honour for Wonderfulness of that Work and the signs of it coming to p  shall be when the false Prophe  s that pretended to raise up th  Dead Man  shall be confounded and dispersed Abroad so t  their Names shall be no more heard of in our Str  ets And th  the  White King  shall be destroy'd from off the face of the Eart  the  Dead Man  shall never Rise again bu  Peace  shall be Est  ▪blish'd for evermore  The Reader may observe that this Paragraph brings the  Prophesie  down to a general Peace if not to the last Day whic  none knows how near its approach may be However we fin  by this plain  y that the  Dead Man  and his Project shall com  to nothing but he be made a  Prey  and  Sacrifice  to the Ambition and Tyranny of the  White King  who shall be disappointe  in the Trust of this Great Governour whoever he shall be fo  he seems resolved by the  Prophesie  to prevent the Effusion o  Blood by readily delivering up his Charge which must immediately put an End to all the  White King  's Designs nay the  Prophesie  seems to Point plainly at his own Destruction at Home while he is so busied in forming Foreign Projects and that the Time is very shortly at hand for it says the sign of its coming to p  ss shall be soon after this A  tempt in  May  next of pretending to rai  e  Emes  the false Prophets  Dead Man  and when we find them disappointed in their Designs as we have no reason to doubt but they will then may we expect the fulfilling of these things That all Foreign Attempts against us will be en  irely baffled the  White King  our Great Enemy utterly destroy'd the  Dead Man  in the  Prophesie  shall never rise again that is we shall be freed from all Fears or Disturbances from him and then there shall be Peace to the End of the World  FINIS
