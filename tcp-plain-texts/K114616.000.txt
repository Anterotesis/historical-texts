DELINEATION OF THE RULING MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES  PART I A DELINEATION OF The RULING MANNERS and PRINCIPLES  SECT I THE DESIGN  SUPERFICIAL though zealous Observers think they see the Source of all our public Miscarriages in the particular and accidental Misconduct of Individuals This is not much to be wondered at because it is so easy a Solution  THIS pretence too is plausibly urged upon the People by profligate Scribblers who find their Account in it It is a sort of Compliment paid the Public to persuade them that they have no Share in the Production of these national Misfortunes  BUT a candid and mature Consideration will convince us that the Malady lies deeper than what is commonly suspected and on impartial Enquiry it will probably be found springing not from varying and incidental but from permanent and established Causes  IT is the observation of the greatest of political Writers that  "it is by no means Fortune that rules the World for this we may appeal to the  Romans  who had a long Series of Prosperities when they acted upon a certain Plan and an  uninterrupted Course of Misfortunes when they conducted themselves upon another There are general Causes natural or moral which operate in every State which raise support or overturn it  "Ce n'est pas la Fortune qui domine le Monde on peut le demander aux Romains qui eurent une suite continuelle des Prosperités quand ils se gouvernerent sur un certain Plan une suite non interrompue de revers lors qu'ils se conduisirent sur un autre Il y a des Causes generales soit morales soit physiques qui agissent dans chaque Monarchie l'elevent la maintiennent ou la precipitent"  Grandeur  c  des Romains  c  "  AMONG all these various Causes none perhaps so much contributes to raise or sink a Nation as the Manners and Principles of its People But as there never was any declining Nation which had not Causes of Declension peculiar to itself so it will require a minute Investigation into the leading  Manners and Principles of the present Times to throw a just Light on the peculiar Causes of our calamitous Situation  To delineate these Manners and Principles without Aggravation or Weakness to unravel their Effects on the public State and Welfare and to trace them to their real though distant Sources is indeed a Task of equal Difficulty and Importance  IT may be necessary therefore to apologise even for the Attempt as being supposed to lie beyond the Sphere of him who makes it To this it can only be replied that a common Eye may  possibly  discover a lurking Rock or Sand while the able and experienced Mariners overlook the Danger through their Attention to the Helm the Sails or Rigging  HE will be much mistaken who expects to find here a Vein of undistinguishing and licentious Satire To rail at the Times at large can serve no good Purpose and generally ariseth from a Want of Knowledge or a Want of Honesty There never was an Age or Nation that had not Virtues and Vices peculiar to itself And in some Respects perhaps there is no Time nor Country delivered down to us in Story in which a wise Man would so much wish to have lived as in our own  NOTWITHSTANDING this our Situation seems most dangerous We are rolling to the Brink of a Precipice that must destroy us  AT such a Juncture to hold up a true Mirroir to the Public and let the Nation see  themselves  as the Authors of their own  Misfortunes cannot be a very popular Design But as the Writer is not sollicitous about private Consequences he can with the greater Security adopt the Words of an honest and sensible Man  "MOST commonly such as palliate Evils and represent the State of Things in a sounder Condition than truly they are do thereby consult best for themselves and better recommend their own Business and Pretensions in the World But he who to the utmost of his Skill and Power speaks the Truth where the Good of his King and Country are concerned will be most esteemed by Persons of Virtue and Wisdom And to the Favour and Protection of such these Papers are committed  Dr  Davenant  on Trade  "  SECT II Of the Spirit of Liberty  BEFORE we enumerate the concurrent Causes of our present Misfortunes and Decline let us by way of Contrast muster the few remaining Virtues we have left to which in part it is owing that our Misfortunes are not heavier and our Decline more rapid  AMONG these the first and most important is the Spirit of Liberty This happily still subsists among us Not indeed in its genuine Vigour for then it would work its genuine effects Yet that the Love of Liberty is not extinguished appears from the  united Voice  of a  divided People  It still animates their Conversation and invigorates their Addresses tho'  in their Conduct it appears no more But it is remarkable that in Proportion as this Spirit hath grown weak in  Deeds  it hath gained Strength in  Words  and of late run out into unbounded License  THIS however appears beyond a Doubt that we all wish to continue free tho' we have not the Virtue to secure our Freedom The Spirit of Liberty is now struggling with the  Manners  and  Principles  as formerly it struggled with the  Tyrants  of the Time But the Danger is now greater because the Enemy is  within  working secretly and securely and destroying all those  internal Powers  from which alone an effectual Opposition can arise  WHEREVER this Spirit of Liberty subsists in its full Vigour the Vigilance and Power of impotent Governors are vain A Nation can neither be surprised nor compelled  into Slavery When this is extinguished neither the Virtue nor Vigilance of Patriots can save it In the Reign of JAMES the Second  Great Britain  was free tho' a despotic Prince was on the Throne At the Time when CESAR fell  Rome  was still inslaved tho' the Tyrant was no more  THIS great Spirit hath produced more full and complete Effects in our own Country than in any known Nation that ever was upon Earth It appears indeed from a Concurrence of Facts too large to be produced here that whereas it hath been ingrafted by the Arts of Policy in other Countries it shoots up here as from its natural Climate Stock and Soil From this Distinction if laid in Nature two or three Consequences will fairly arise Its Effects must of course be more vigorous  and full It's Destruction by external Violence will probably be no more than temporary It's chief Danger must arise from such Causes as may poison the Root or attack and destroy the natural Spirit itself These must be such Causes as can steal upon and subdue the  Mind  that is they must be  "some Degeneracy or Corruption of the Manners and Principles of the People"  SECT III Of the Spirit of Humanity  LET us now trace the Spirit of Liberty through such of its Effects as are not yet destroyed by opposite Principles and Manners  THE first that occurs is  Humanity  By this is not meant that Smoothness and refined Polish of external Manners by which the present Age affects to be distinguished  for this it is apprehended will belong to another Class By  Humanity  therefore is meant  "that Pity for Distress that Moderation in limiting Punishments by their proper Ends and Measures by which this Nation hath always been distinguished"  THE Lenity of our Laws in capital Cases our Compassion for convicted Criminals even the general Humanity of our Highwaymen and Robbers compared with those of other Countries these are concurrent Proofs that the Spirit of Humanity is natural to our Nation  THE many noble Foundations for the Relief of the Miserable and the Friendless the large annual Supplies from voluntary Charities to these Foundations the frequent and generous Assistance given to the Unfortunate who cannot be admitted into these  Foundations all these are such indisputable Proofs of a national Humanity as it were the highest Injustice not to acknowledge and applaud  SECT IV Of the civil Administration of Justice  ANOTHER Virtue and of the highest Consequence as it regards the immediate and private Happiness of Individuals yet left among us is the pure Administration of Justice as it regards private Property  MANY Causes may be assigned for the Continuance of this public Blessing The Spirit of Liberty and Humanity beget a Spirit of Equity where no contrary Passion interferes The Spirit of Commerce now predominant begets a kind of regulated Selfishness which tends at once to the Increase and Preservation of Property The Difficulty of corrupting Juries under the  Checks of their present Establishment in most Cases prevents the very Attempt And the longcontinued Example of a great Person on the Seat of Equity hath diffused an uncorrupt Spirit through the inferior Courts and will shine to the latest Posterity  SECT V Of the Ruling Manners of the Times  HAVING made this prefatory Estimate of those remaining Manners which may demand Esteem and Applause let us now proceed to the ruling Manners of the Times from which this Age and Nation derives its present and particular Complexion  IT may be necessary to remark that this designed Estimate extends not to the comparative Excellence of Manners and Principles  considered in every View and in all their Variety of near and remote Effects It relates not to the immediate Happiness or Misery which Individuals Families or Nations may derive from the Force of prevailing Principles and Manners These Effects branch out into an Infinity of intricate Combinations which cannot be comprehended in the present but will make a material Part of some future Enquiry This Estimate therefore confines itself to such Consequences only as affect the  Duration  of the  public State  So that the leading Question will be  "How far the present ruling Manners and Principles of this Nation may tend to its Continuance or Destruction"  IN Consequence of this Restriction the Manners and Principles of the common People will scarce find a Place in the Account For though the Sum total of a Nations  immediate Happiness must arise and be estimated from the Manners and Principles of the Whole yet the Manners and Principles of those who  lead  not of those who  are led  of those who  govern  not of those who  are governed  of those in short who  make  Laws or  execute  them will ever determine the Strength or Weakness and therefore the Continuance or Dissolution of a State  FOR the blind Force or Weight of an ungoverned Multitude can have no steady nor rational Effect unless some  leading Mind  rouse it into Action and  point  it to it's proper  End  without this it is either a  brute  and random  Bolt  or a  lifeless Ball  sleeping in the  Cannon  It depends on some superior  Intelligence  to give it both  Impulse  and  Direction  INDEED were the  People  remarkably corrupt they might properly make a Part  of this Enquiry But in most of those important Circumstances to which this Estimate refers they are in general much more irreproachable than their Superiors in Station especially if we except the lower Ranks of those who live in great Towns It will therefore be unnecessary to mark the Character of their Principles or Manners unless where they appear evidently poisoned by the Example or other Influence of the higher Ranks in Life  Now the slighest Observation if attended with Impartiality may convince us that the Character of the Manners of this Age and Nation is by no means that of  abandoned Wickedness  and  Profligacy  This Degree of Degeneracy indeed is often imputed to the Times But to what Times hath it  not  been imputed Present Objects are naturally magnified to the human  Eye while remote ones though larger in Dimensions vanish into nothing Hence the Speculative and Virtuous in every Age confining their Views to their own Period have been apt to aggravate its Manners into the highest Degree of Guilt to  satyrize  rather than  describe  to throw their respective Times into one dark Shade of  Horror  rather than mark their peculiar  Colour  and  Complexion  HERE a large Field of Comparison and Debate would open were it necessary or even expedient to enter upon it We might cast our Eye upon the Manners of ROME CARTHAGE and many other States in their last declining Period where we should behold such tragic Scenes of Cruelty Impiety and Oppression as would confound the most sanguine Advocate for the Manners of Antiquity But in Truth  there can be no Occasion for this Display of  Profligacy  For if the previous Estimate already given be just if the Spirit of  Liberty Humanity  and  Equity  be in a  certain Degree  yet left among us some of the most essential Foundations of abandoned Wickedness and Profligacy can have no Place For these are  Servility Cruelty  and  Oppression  How far we may be from this last Period of Degeneracy it were Presumption to affirm At present it is certain we are not arrived at it Whenever this fatal Time approaches it will come distinguished by its proper and peculiar Characters and whoever shall estimate such Times will find himself under the same Circumstance with the great Historian who in the profligate Period of declining ROME tells us he had nothing to relate but  "false Accusations bloody Proscriptions treacherous Friendships  and the Destruction of the Innocent  "Saeva jussa continuas accusationes fallaces amicitias perniciem innocentium"  Tacit Annal  l iv  "  THIS we may truly affirm is far from the Character of the Manners of our Times which on a fair Examination will probably appear to be that of a  "vain luxurious  and  selfish  EFFEMINACY"  THIS will be evident from a simple Enumeration of acknowledged Facts many of them indeed in Appearance too trite to merit Notice and too trifling for Rebuke were they not in their Tendency as fatal to the Stability of a Nation as Maxims and Manners more apparently flagitious  As the first Habits of Infancy and Youth commonly determine the Character of the  Man we might trace the Effeminacy of modern Manners even to the unwholesome Warmth of a Nursery As soon as the puny Infant is suffered to peep from this Fountain of  Weakness  and Disease he is confirmed in the Habits already contracted by a mistaken Tenderness and Care The  "School Boy's Satchel and shining MorningFace"  once the Characteristic of the Age itself are now only to be seen among the Sons of Villagers and Peasants while the Youth of Quality and Fortune is wrapt up from the wholesome Keenness of the Air And thus becomes incapable of enduring the natural Rigours of his own Climate  'TIS odds indeed but the Prevalence of Fashion places him in some public School where the learned Languages are taught And to do Justice to the Times the most considerable among these Seminaries  were never more ably supplied than at present But whatever be the Master's Ability the Scholar's can in general reach no farther than to  Words  this first Stage of Education therefore can only be preparatory to a higher without which the other is defeated of its Purpose  HERE then lies an essential Defect in modern Education The Pupil is not carried on from  Words  to  Things  The  Universities  where the Principles of  Knowledge  should be imbibed are growing daily thinner of young Men of Quality and Fortune Instead of being initiated in  Books  where the Wisdom of Ages lies reposed our untutored Youth are carried into the  World  where the ruling Objects that catch the Imagination are the Sallies of Folly or of Vice  THUS like  Plants  hastily removed from their first Bed and exposed to the Inclemencies of an unwholesome Air without the Intervention of a higher and more enlarged  Nursery  where stronger Shoots might be obtained our rising Youth are checked in their  first Growths  and either  die away  into Ignorance or at most become  Dwarfs  in Knowledge  BUT here it must not be disguised that an Abuse through Time hath insensibly crept upon the  Universities  themselves and greatly impaired their Use and Credit The public Fountains of Instruction are at length dried up and the  Professorships  founded as the Means of general Instruction degenerated into gainful  Sinecures  Instead of these where by a proper Choice every Department would naturally be filled with Ability in its respective Science the  private  Lectures of  CollegeTutors  have usurped  and occupied their Place Thus the great Lines of Knowledge are broken and the Fragments retailed at all Adventures by  every Member  of a College who chuseth to erect himself into a  Professor of every Science  What can be the Consequence of this Practice but a  partial  and  superficial Instruction  'Tis true there are in this Sphere who would do Honour to the highest Academical Station But what an Accession of Lustre Fame and Knowledge would our Universities receive were these  few  now confined to the narrow Sphere of  particular  Colleges ordained and  appointed  to  illuminate  the  whole  NEITHER would it reflect any Dishonour on our Universities if the few young Men of Fashion yet found there were laid under the same Restraints of moral and literary Discipline with those of inferior Quality  THE next Error that presents itself to Observation is that of sending our ignorant Youth abroad A Mind stored with Taste and Knowledge will indeed naturally refine that Taste and increase that Knowledge by seeing and  judging  of foreign Countries For thus he acquires a large Addition of new Experiences and Examples which may confirm or rectify his prior Observations On the contrary we may affirm with Truth that no Circumstance in Education can more surely tend to strengthen Effeminacy and Ignorance than the present premature and indigested  Travel  For as the uninstructed Youth must needs meet with a Variety of Example good and bad vile and praiseworthy as his Manners are childish and his Judgment crude he will naturally imbibe what is most consentaneous with his puerile Habits Thus while Wisdom and Virtue can find no Place  in him every Foreign Folly Effeminacy or Vice meeting with a correspondent Soil at once take Root and flourish  BUT suppose him  not  of that Rank or Fortune which may demand or admit of the grand Tour he is then brought up to  London  and initiated in the Pleasures of the Metropolis Here then let us view him inspired with every fashionable Ambition while we take an impartial Estimate of those Amusements or rather Employments which attract the Attention of the Town and form the Genius and Character of the present and rising Generation  THE first and capital Article of TownEffeminacy is that of  Dress  which in all its Variety of modern Excess and Ridicule is too low for serious Animadversion Yet in this must every Man of every Rank and Age employ his Mornings who pretends to keep  good Company  The wisest the most  virtuous the most polite if defective in these exterior and unmanly Delicacies are avoided as  low People  whom  Nobody knows  and with whom one is  ashamed to be seen  How would he have been derided in the Days of ELIZABETH when a great Queen rode on Horseback to  St Paul's  who should have foretold that in less than two Centuries no Man of Fashion would cross the Street to Dinner without the effeminate Covering and Conveyance of an  easy Chair  YET thus accoutred the modern Man of Fashion is  conveyed  to Company Whereever he goes he meets the same false Delicacy in all Every Circumstance of modern Use conspires to sooth him into the Excess of Effeminacy Warm Carpets are spread under his Feet warm Hangings  surround him Doors and Windows nicely jointed prevent the least rude Encroachment of the external Air  VANITY lends her Aid to this unmanly Delicacy Splendid Furniture a sumptuous Sideboard a long Train of Attendants an elegant and costly Entertainment for which Earth Air and Seas are ransacked the most expensive Wines of the Continent the childish Vagaries of a whimsical Desert these are the supreme Pride of the Master the Admiration or Envy of his Guests  LUXURY is not idle in her Province but shares with her Sister Vanity in the Labours of the Day High Soups and Sauces every Mode of foreign Cookery that can quicken Taste and spur the lagging Appetite is assiduously employed The End of Eating is not the allaying of natural Hunger  but the Gratification of fordid and debasing Appetite Hence the most inflaming Foods not those which  nourish  but those which  irritate  are adopted while the cool and temperate Diets that purify the Blood are banished to inferior Tables To this every Man of Taste now aspires as to the true  sçavoir vivre  Do you expect in these fashionable Meetings to hear some Point of Morals Taste in Arts or Literature discoursed or canvassed Alas these are long since expelled from every modish Assembly To speak any thing that carries Weight and Importance is an Offence against Goodbreeding The supreme Elegance is to trifle agreeably  BUT as Insipidity of Conversation is soon worn out and as Intemperance in Wine is  not of the Character of refined Luxury so to prevent the Stagnation of Folly some awakening Amusement is naturally sought for  WE read in ancient Story that in the most polished Court of the most refined Period a Reward was proclaimed to him who should invent a new Pleasure This may justly be styled the last wretched Efsort of bungling and despairing LuxuryThe great Desideratum is at length found A Pleasure which absorbs the whole Man a Pleasure in which there is no Satiety which cloys not by Use but gains new Vigour from Enjoyment The Vulgar only can need to be informed that the Pleasure here alluded to is that of GAMING  BUT as the present increasing Splendor of Dress Equipage Furniture Entertainments is enormously expensive what can so naturally create a Lust of Gold as the vain Ambition of Equality or Superiority in this System of effeminate Shew Hence  Rapacity  attends  Profusion  till the Spirit of Avarice glides secretly into the Soul and impels the Man of Fashion to that  Gaming  as a  Trade  which he had before adopted as a  Pleasure  But as we read that CAESAR's Lust was only the  Servant  of his  Ambition  so this Lust of Gold is no more than the  Handmaid  to vain  Effeminacy  THUS we see  Gaming  established on the two great Pillars of  Self Interest  and  Pleasure  and on these Foundations seems to rest the midnight Riot and Dissipation of modern Assemblies  BUT tho' Gaming be now the capital Pleasure as well as Trade of most Men of Fashion yet other incidental Amusements intervene at vacant Times Neither can it be affirmed with Truth that all are immersed in this fashionable Folly Nor let any one imagine that he stands clear of the ruling Manners of the Times because not infected with the Rage of  Gaming  Let us then proceed to examine the other reigning Amusements of the Age and see how far they are or are not subject to the Charge of  unmanly  Delicacy  A KNOWLEDGE of Books a Taste in Arts a Proficiency in Science was formerly regarded as a proper Qualification in a Man of Fashion The Annals of our Country have transmitted to us the Name and Memory of Men as eminent in Learning and Taste as in Rank and Fortune  It will not I presume be regarded as any kind of Satire on the present Age to say that among the higher Ranks this literary Spirit is generally vanished  Reading  is now sunk at best into a Morning's  Amusement  till the important Hour of Dress comes on Books are no longer regarded as the Repositories of Taste and Knowledge but are rather laid hold of as a gentle Relaxation from the tedious Round of Pleasure  BUT what kind of Reading must  that  be which can attract or entertain the languid MorningSpirit of modern Effeminacy Any indeed that can but prevent the unsupportable Toil of  Thinking  that may serve as a preparatory  Whet  of  Indolence  to the approaching Pleasures of the Day Thus it comes to pass that weekly Essays amatory Plays and Novels political  Pamphlets and Books that revile Religion together with a general  Hash  of these served up in some  monthly Mess  of  Dulness  are the meagre  literary Diet  of Town and Country  TRUE it is that amidst this general Defect of Taste and Learning there is  a Writer  whose Force of Genius and Extent of Knowledge might almost redeem the Character of the Times But that Superiority which attracts the Reverence of the  Few  excites the Envy and Hatred of the  Many  And while his Works are translated and admired  Abroad  and patronized at  Home  by those who are most distinguished in Genius Taste and Learning himself is abused and his Friends insulted for his Sake by those who never read his Writings or if they did could neither  taste  nor  comprehend  them while every  little aspiring or despairing Scribler eyes him as CASSIUS did CESAR and whispers to his Fellow  Why Man he doth bestride the narrow World  Like a  Colossus  and we petty Men  Walk under his huge Legs and peep about  To find ourselves dishonourable Graves  No wonder then if the Malice of the  Lilliputian  Tribe be bent against this dreaded GULLIVER if they attack him with  poisoned Arrows  whom they cannot subdue by  Strength  BUT in Justice to the present Age another Observation must be added As Excess of Delicacy hath destroyed our  Force of Taste  it hath at least had one laudable Effect for along with this it hath carried off our  Grossness  of  Obscenity  A strong Characteristic this of the Manners of the Times The untractable  Spirit of Lewdness is sunk into gentle Gallantry and  Obscenity  itself is grown  effeminate  BUT what  Vice  hath lost in  Coarseness  of Expression she hath gained in a more easy and general  Admittance  In ancient Days  bare  and  impudent Obscenity  like a common Woman of the Town was confined to  Brothels  Whereas the  DoubleEntendre  like a modern fine Lady is now admitted into the  best Company  while her  transparent Covering  of Words like a  thin  fashionable  Gawze  delicately thrown across  discloses  while it seems to  veil  her  Nakedness  of Thought  No wonder if these leading Characters of false Delicacy influence our other Entertainments and be attended with a low and unmanly Taste in  Music  That divine  Art capable of inspiring every thing that is great or excellent of rouzing every nobler Passion of the Soul is at length dwindled into a Woman's or an Eunuch's effeminate Trill The chaste and solemn Airs of CORELLI of GEMINIANI and their best Disciples the divine and lofty Flights of CALDARA and MARCELLO the elegant Simplicity of BONONCINI the manly the pathetic the astonishing Strains of HANDEL are neglected and despised While instead of these our Concerts and Operas are disgraced with the lowest Insipidity of Composition and unmeaning  SingSong  The Question now concerns not the Expression the Grace the Energy or Dignity of the Musick We go not to admire the  Composition  but the  Tricks  of the  Performer  who is then surest of our ignorant Applause when he runs through the Compass of the  Throat  or traverses the  Fingerboard  with the  swiftest Dexterity  WHILE  Music  is thus debased into Effeminacy her SisterArt of  Painting  cannot hope a better Fate For the same Dignity of Manners must  support  the same Indignity  depress  them Connoisseurs there are indeed who have either  Taste  or  Vanity  Yet even by these the Art is considered as a Matter of  Curiosity  not of  Influence  a Circumstance which proves their Taste to be spurious undirected or superficial But with regard to the public Eye this is generally depraved Neither the comic Pencil nor the serious Pen of our ingenious Countryman  Mr  Hogarth's  Treatise on the Principles of Beauty  have been able to keep alive the Taste of Nature or of Beauty The fantastic and grotesque have banished  both  Every House of Fashion is  now crowded with Porcelain Trees and Birds Porcelain Men and Beasts crosslegged Mandarins and Bramins perpendicular Lines and stiff right Angles Every gaudy  Chinese  Crudity either in Colour Form Attitude or Grouping is adopted into fashionable Use and become the Standard of Taste and Elegance  LET us then search the Theatre for the Remains of manly Taste And  here  apparently at least it must be acknowledged we shall find it A great Genius hath arisen to dignify the Stage who when it was sinking into the lowest Insipidity restored it to the Fulness of its ancient Splendor and with a Variety of Powers beyond Example established  Nature Shakespear  and  Himself  BUT as the Attractions of the Theatre arise from a Complication of Causes beyond  those of any other Entertainment so while the judicious Critic admires his original Excellencies it may well be questioned whether the Crowd be not drawn by certain secondary Circumstances rather than by a Discernment of his real Powers Need we any other Proof of this than the Conduct of his fashionable Hearers who sit with the same Face of Admiration at LEAR an OPERA or a PANTOMIME  THESE seem to be the main and leading Articles of our unmanly WinterDelicacies And as to our SummerAmusements they are much of the same  Make  only  lighter  and if possible more  trifling  As soon as the Season is grown so mild as that the Man of Fashion can stir abroad he is seen lolling in his  PostChariot  about the Purlieus of the Town The manly Exercise of  Riding  is generally disused as  too coarse and indelicate for the fine Gentleman The Metropolis growing thin as the Spring advances the same Rage of Pleasure Dress Equipage and Dissipation which in Winter had chained him to the Town now drives him to the Country For as a vain and empty Mind can never give Entertainment to itself so to avoid the Taedium of Solitude and SelfConverse  Parties  of Pleasure are again formed the same Effeminacies under new Appearances are acted over again and become the  Business  of the Season There is hardly a Corner of the Kingdom where a  Summer Scene  of public  Dissipation  is not now established Here the Parties meet till the Winter sets in and the separate Societies are once more met in  London  THUS we have attempted a simple Delineation of the ruling Manners of the Times  If any thing like Ridicule appears to mix itself with this Review it ariseth not from the  Aggravation  but the natural  Display  of  Folly  IT may probably be asked Why the ruling Manners of our Women have not been particularly delineated The Reason is because they are essentially the same with those of the Men and are therefore included in this Estimate The Sexes have now little other apparent Distinction beyond that of Person and Dress Their peculiar and characteristic Manners are confounded and lost The one Sex having advanced into  Boldness  as the other have sunk into  Effeminacy  SECT VI Of Principles  MOST Writers who have attempted to prove the Efficacy of Principle have supposed it to be the great and universal Fountain of Manners They who have espoused the opposite System observing this Theory to be at variance with Fact have rashly concluded that Principle is void of all real Influence  THE Truth seems to lie between these two Opinions Principles cannot be the Fountain of Manners because Manners precede Principles That is in our Progress from Infancy Habits of  Acting  are  prior  to Habits of  Thinking  Yet on the other Hand Principles early and deeply ingrafted in the Mind may grow up with  Manners may be at variance with Manners may yield to Manners or gathering Strength by Cultivation may check controll or destroy them  THIS Distinction is proper for many Reasons One is evident It shews the Propriety of treating of the Manners  first  and  then  the Principles of the Times  THE Principles here to be estimated are such only as tend to counterwork the  selfish Passions  These are the Principle of  Religion  the Principle of  Honour  and the Principle of  public Spirit  The first of these has the  Deity  for it's Object the second the  Applause  of Men the third the  Approbation  of  our own Heart  Let us examine the present Influence of these several Principles on the Manners already delineated  DID the Writer court the Applause of his polite Readers if any such peradventure may honour him with their Regard he would preface this Part of his Subject with an Apology for the Rudeness of hinting at  religious Principle  To suppose a Man of Fashion swayed in his Conduct by a Regard to  Futurity  is an Affront to the Delicacy and Refinement of his  Taste  Hence the Day set apart by the Laws of his Country for religious Service he derides and affronts as a  vulgar  and  obsolete  Institutution Should you propose to him the Renewal of that  Family Devotion  which concluded the guiltless Evening Entertainments of his Ancestry You would become an Object of his Pity rather than Contempt The sublime Truths the pure and simple Morals of the Gospel are despised and trod under foot Can we wonder if that Profession  which asserts these Truths and preaches these Morals be treated with a similar Contempt But Irreligion knows no Bounds when once let loose and Christianity herself hath been obliquely insulted within those  consecrated  Walls where  Decency  and  Policy  in the Absence of  Reason  and  Virtue  would for ever have held her in  legal Reverence  BUT notwithstanding the general Contempt of Religion among the fashionable World the uninformed Reader is not to imagine that the present Age is deep in the  Speculations  of  Infidelity  No such Matter for that would imply a certain  Attention  to these Subjects a certain Degree of SelfConverse and Thought and this would clash with the ruling Manners of the Times Indeed there have not been wanting laborious Husbandmen who have painfully  sown their Tares not in the Night Season but in broad Daylight These have at length shot up into a large and fruitful Crop of  irreligious implicit  FAITH For implicit Faith is  Belief  or  Disbelief  without Evidence and  why  they disbelieve I trow few of the present Age can tell They have other Attentions than the meagre Sophisms of Irreligion and are therefore well content with the  Conclusions  without the  Premises  This Distinction will lead us to the plain Reason why in an Age of Irreligion so capital a Book as the Writings of Lord BOLINGBROKE met with so cold a Reception in the World Had they appeared under the inviting Shape of  "ESSAYS  philosophical and moral"  they might have come within the Compass of a Breakfastreading or amused the Man of Fashion while under the Discipline of the  curling Tongs  But five  huge Quarto  Volumes like  five  coarse  Dishes of Beef and Mutton tho' fraught with the very  Marrow  of Infidelity what  puny  modern  Appetite  could possibly  sit down to  IN Confirmation of these Truths we may conclude this Part of our Subject with a not incurious Anecdote A certain Historian of our own Times bent upon  Popularity  and  Gain  published a large Volume and omitted no Opportunity that offered to disgrace Religion A large Impression was published and a small Part sold The Author being asked why he had so larded his Work with Irreligion his Answer modestly implied  "He had done it that his Book might sell"  It was whispered him that he had totally mistaken the Spirit of the Times that no Allurements could engage the  fashionable  Infidel World to travel through a large Quarto And that as the  few Readers of Quarto's that yet remain lie mostly among the serious Part of Mankind he had offended his best Customers and ruined the Sale of his Book This Information had a notable Effect for a second Volume as large and instructive as the first hath appeared not a Smack of Irreligion is to be found in it and an Apology for the  first  concludes the whole  THIS being the State of religious Principle let us next examine how it fares with the  Principle  of  Honour  By this is meant  "The Desire of Fame or the Applause of Men directed to the End of public Happiness"  Now this great Ambition which in other Times or Nations hath wrought such wonderful Effects is no longer to be found among us It is the Pride of  Equipage  the Pride of  Title  the Pride of  Fortune  or the Pride of  Dress  that  have assumed the Empire over our Souls and levelled  Ambition  with the  Dirt  The honest Pride of  Virtue  is  no more  or where it happens to exist is overwhelmed by inferior Vanities A Man who should go out of the common Road of Life in Pursuit of Glory and serve the Public at the Expence of his Ease his Fortune or his Pleasure would be stared or laughed at in every fashionable Circle as a silly Fellow who meddled with Things that did not belong to him As an Ideot who preferred Shadows to Realities and needless Toil to pleasurable Enjoyment The laurel Wreath once aspired after as the highest Object of Ambition would now be rated at the Marketprice of its Materials and derided as a  threepenny Crown  And if its modern Substitutes the  Ribbon  or the  Coronet  be eagerly sought for it is not that they are regarded as the  Distinctions  of  public Virtue  but as the  Ensigns  of  Vanity  and  Place  BUT what implies or proves the general Extinction of the Principle of Honour is a peculiar Circumstance which at first View seems to challenge Praise It hath been weakly attributed to the moderate and forgiving Spirit of these Times that no Age ever so patiently suffered its ruling Follies to be laughed at But this in truth is a superficial and inadequate Representation as well as Solution of the Fact We not only suffer our ruling Vices and Follies to be ridiculed but we cordially join in the Laugh Was there ever a juster Picture drawn than of modern  Effeminacy  and  Nonchalance  in the Characters of FRIBBLE and Lord CHALKSTONE Did ever dramatic Characters raise louder Peals of Laughter and Applause even among those  who sat for the Likeness They hear with Pleasure they acknowledge the Truth of the Representation they laugh at the Picture of their own Follies they go home and  without a Blush repeat them  The Truth is therefore that we can see and own our Vices and Follies  without being touched with Shame  a Circumstance which ancient Times justly regarded as the strongest Indication of degenerate and incorrigible Manners  IT appears then that the Principle of Honour is either lost or totally corrupted That no generous Thirst of Praise is left among us That our Ambitions are trifling and unmanly as our Pleasures That Wealth Titles Dress Equipage Sagacity in Gaming or Wagers splendid Furniture and a Table are the sole Fountains from which we desire to draw Respect to ourselves or Applause from others We aspire  to Folly and are proud of Meanness Thus the Principle of  Honour  is perverted and dwindled into  unmanly Vanity  CAN it be imagined that amidst this general Defect of  Religion  and  Honour  the great and comprehensive Principle of  public Spirit  or  Love of our Country  can gain a Place in our Breasts That mighty Principle so often feigned so seldom possessed which requires the united Force of upright  Manners  generous  Religion  and unfeigned  Honour  to support it What Strength of Thought or conscious Merit can there be in effeminate Minds sufficient to elevate them to this Principle whose Object is  "the Happiness of a Kingdom"  To speak therefore without Flattery this Principle is perhaps less felt among us than even those of Religion and true Honour So infatuated are we in our Contempt of this powerful Principle that we deride  the Inhabitants of a  SisterKingdom  for their  national Attachments  and  Regards  So little are we accustomed to go or even  think  beyond the beaten Track of private Interest in all Things that regard our  Country  that he who merely does his  Duty  in any conspicuous Station is looked on as a Prodigy of public Virtue But in other Times and Nations when this Principle was in Force Enterprises were formed and Deeds done which it would now be thought Phrenzy to attempt Think what a Friend will do for a Friend a Sister for a Brother a Lover for his Mistress a Parent for his Child even  that  in all its Fulness of Affection in other Times and Nations hath been the Aim and the Work of public Virtue  doing  or  suffering  for its  Country's Welfare  DOMESTIC Affections are not yet generally extinguished There are kind Fathers  kind Mothers affectionate Children Sisters Brothers Humanity to Distress we have already marked as another Character of the Times But whether our very Effeminacy be not one of its Sources might probably be a Question more  curious  in its Progress than  agreeable  in its Solution  HOWEVER that be let us be modest in our Claims and confess that our Affections seldom reach farther than our Relations our Friends or Individuals in Distress Happy in the present it is for us that they reach so far Happy were it for us or our Posterity that they were of more inlarged Extent In the mean Time let us with due Abasement of Heart acknowledge that the  Love  of our  Country  is no longer felt and that except in a few Minds of uncommon Greatness the Principle of  public Spirit  EXISTS NOT  IT is not affirmed or implied in this general Review that  every Individual  hath assumed the Garb and Character of false Delicacy and uncontrouled SelfLove As in  manly  Ages some will be  effeminate  so in  effeminate  Times the  manly  Character will be found As in Times of Principle some will be void of Principle so in Times when Principle is derided in some superior Minds Principle will be found But from the general Combination of Manners and Principles in every Period of Time will always result one ruling and predominant Character as from a confused Multitude of different Voices results one general Murmur and strikes the distant Ear or from a Field covered with Flocks Herds or Armies though various in themselves results one general and permanent Colour and strikes the distant Eye  Nam saepe in Colli tendentes pabula laeta  Lanigerae reptant Pecudes quo quamque vocantes  Invitant Herbae gemmantes Rore recenti  Et satiati Agni ludunt blandeque coniscant  Omnia quae nobis  longe confusa  videntur  Et veluti in viridi  Candor consistere  Colli  Lucretius l ii    IT is enough then if from a proper  Point of View  we have fixed the  ruling Colour  of the Manners and Principles for on this will depend the  ruling Character  of the  Times  AS it appears therefore from this Delineation that SHOW and PLEASURE are the main Objects of Pursuit As the general Habit of  refined Indulgence  is  strong  and the Habit of  induring  is  lost  As the general Spirit of  Religion Honour  and  publick Love  are weakened or vanished as  these Manners are therefore left to their own Workings uncontrouled by  Principle  we may with Truth and Candour conclude that the ruling Character of the present Times is that of  "a  vain luxurious  and  selfish  EFFEMINACY"  PART II OF THE PUBLIC EFFECTS OF THESE MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES  PART II OF THE PUBLIC EFFECTS OF These MANNERS and PRINCIPLES  SECT I What constitutes the Strength of a Nation  HITHERTO we have done little more than  delineate  the ruling Manners and Principles of the Times we must now assume a severer Tone and  reason  upon the  Facts  thus established  THERE are three leading Circumstances on which the  internal Strength  of every Nation most essentially depends These are the  Capacity Valour  and  Union  of those who  lead  the People The first may be called  "the  national Capacity  the second the  national Spirit of Defence  the third the national  Spirit of Union"  THE next Step therefore will be to consider all that Variety of Respects in which the ruling Manners and Defect of Principle already delineated must naturally weaken or destroy these Sources of  internal  Power  As this Enquiry will of course lead to a particular View of those several Ranks Departments Employments or Professions into which such a Nation is divided  it is presumed that no Instances alledged or Facts alluded to will be weakly construed into the Wantonness of licentious Satire Every Profession is honourable when directed to its proper End the Publick Welfare And the Intention of this Estimate is not to  defame  but to  enquire  how far the several  Departments  or  Professions  on which the internal Strength of this Nation depends are  properly  or  improperly  directed  SECT II Of the national Capacity  LET us then first enquire how far the false Delicacy and Effeminacy of present Manners may have weakened or destroyed the  national Capacity  IT was a shrewd Observation of a good old Writer  "How can he get Wisdom whose Talk is of Bullocks  Book of Wisdom  "  But  Rusticity  is not more an Enemy of Knowledge than  Effeminacy  With the same Propriety therefore it may now be asked  "How can he get Wisdom whose Talk is of  Dress  and  Wagers Cards  and  Boroughjobbing Horses Women  and  Dice"  The Man of Fashion is indeed cut off from the very Means of solid Instruction His late Hours occasion a late rising and thus the Morning which should be devoted to the Acquisition of  Knowledge  is devoted to  Sleep  to  Dress  and  Ignorance  HOW weak then must be the national Capacity of that People whose leading  Members in  public Employ  should in general be formed on such a Model If instead of a general Application to Books instead of investigating the great Principles of  Legislation  the Genius of their national Constitution or its Relations and Dependencies on that of others the great Examples and Truths of  History  the Maxims of generous and upright  Policy  and the severer Truths of  Philosophy  on which all these are foundedif instead of these they should seldom rise in  political  Study higher than the securing of a  Borough  instead of  History  be only read in  Novels  instead of  Legislation  in  Party Pamphlets  instead of  Philosophy  in  Irreligion  instead of manly and upright  Manners  in trifling  Entertainments Dress  and  Gaming  If this should ever be their ruling Character what must be expected from such established  Ignorance  but  Errors  in the first Concoction  IN a Nation thus circumstanced it is odds but you would see even some of its most public and solemn Assemblies turned into Scenes of unmanly Riot instead of the  Dignity  of  Freedom  the  Tumults  of  Licentiousness  would prevail Forwardness of young Men without Experience intemperate Ridicule dissolute Mirth and loud Peals of Laughter would be the ruling Character of such an Assembly  THIS Reflexion some how or other calls up the Memory of a Circumstance or two peculiar to the public Meetings of the  Athenians  In the Court of  Areopagus  so little was  Ridicule  regarded as a  Test of Truth  that it was held an unpardonable Offence for any Member to  laugh  while  the Assembly was sittingAnother wise and prudent Regulation was the Practice of the  Cryer  in the  Senate  who before Business began called out aloud  "Who will speak that is turned of Fifty"  IT is true that in every Assembly of this Kind the public Measures will generally be determined by the  Few  whose Superiority is approved and acknowledged By the  Few  who have been so unfashionable as to despise the ruling System of Effeminacy and before they had appeared on a  higher Stage  had  laboured  and  shone  in a  College  But what an Increase of  national Capacity  must arise if those  MasterSpirits  were aided and their Plans of Government examined and improved by Men of the like  Application  and  Ability  BUT if in any Nation the Number of these superior Minds be daily decreasing from the growing Manners of the Times what can a Nation so circumstanced have more to fear than that in another Age a general Cloud of Ignorance may overshadow it  How much or how little in this Particular  we  resemble the declining State of the  Roman  Republic let any one determine from the following Passage Where the great Author after celebrating the general  Ability  of those who were  formerly  in public Station concludes thus  "Nunc contra plerique ad honores adipiscendos et ad rempublicam gerendam  nudi  veniunt atque  inermes  nulla cognitione rerum nulla scientia ornati  Cic de Oratore l iii  "  LET us next consider the natural Effects of these effeminate Manners on  Fleets  and  Armies  And here 'tis supposed it will be readily acknowledged that the Conduct and Fate of Fleets and Armies depend much on the Capacity of those that lead them through every Rank of Office Chiefly indeed of those who are  highest  in Command but in Part too of those who fill the  lower  Stations the more because they in inferior Rank  aspire  and by Degrees  ascend  to the highest  Now I apprehend it would be ill taken to  suppose  that the fashionable and  prevailing Manners  abound not in the  Army  and  Navy  The Gentlemen of these Professions are even  distinguished  by their Taste in  Dress  their Skill at  Play  their Attendance on every  Amusement  provided  it be but  fashionable  And sure it must be by Miracle if this trifling and effeminate Life conduct them to  Knowledge  or produce  Capacity  It were unjust to deny that Men of Ability in this Order are  yet  among us But it would be Matter of great Pleasure and Expectation to the Public to find  Ignorance  in this  Profession  either  uncommon  or  disgraceful  WOULD these Gentlemen please to look into History they would find that in  polished Times  few have ever distinguished themselves in  War  who were not eminent or considerable in  Letters  They would find PISISTRATUS PERICLES ALCIBIADES DION AGESILAUS EPAMINONDAS among the  Greeks  in the  Roman  List both the SCIPIO'S CATO the elder and the younger LUCULLUS POMPEY BRUTUS CESAR distinguished in  Letters  as in  War  'TIS true indeed that in barbarous Ages there want not Instances of unlearned Leaders who have done mighty Actions in Battle But we must observe that these were at least practised in their own Profession It is farther to be observed that in such Times the Fate of War depends little on  Stratagem  or  Discipline  But it is chiefly to be observed that no general Rule can be drawn from a few Instances A Man of great natural Talents takes mighty Strides in any Science or Profession He is selftaught While the common Run of Men whom Nature hath destined to travel on to Improvement by the beaten Track of Industry through a blind and illunderstood Imitation of his superior Conduct must for ever fall the Victims of their  Vanity  and  Ignorance  HERE then we find another ruling Defect in the national Capacity of an effeminate  People How few can arise amidst this general  Dissipation  of Manners capable of conducting its Fleets and Armies Or even suppose a Man of Application and Ability possessed of the chief Command yet in Case he falls in Battle how small must be the Chance that the next in Succession upon whom his Command naturally devolves can be  equal  to the Importance of his  new Station  THERE is another  Profession  which under this Article of the  national Capacity  the vulgar Reader will naturally expect to find considered I mean that of the  Clergy  But the general Defect of religious Principle among the higher Ranks hath rendered this order of Men altogether useless except among those in  middle Life  where they still maintain a certain Degree of Estimation The Contempt with which not  they  but their  Profession  is treated by the  Ignorant  and  Profligate  is equally common indeed to  high  and  low  Life A Circumstance which may be an Occasion of  Pride  in the  one  but ought rather to be Matter of  Humiliation  to the other 'Tis true a modern Writer felicitates the present Times and makes it their Boast that  "the Clergy have lost their Influence  See Mr  Hume's  Essays  "  By which he evidently means that Religion hath lost its Influence Yet of this at least one of the Order may decently remind his Countrymen that when the  English Protestant Clergy  and that Christianity which they teach were most  honoured  and respected at  Home England  was then most honoured and respected  Abroad  AND although the present fashionable Contempt that is thrown upon their  Profession  preclude the Clergy from the  Opportunity  had they the  Will  to practice that Christian Duty of  "overcoming Evil with Good  yet they need not blush to find that they have  fallen  with the  Fame  the  Manners  and  Principles  of their Country nor can the worthy Part of them sure aspire to  truer Glory  than to have become the  Contempt  of  those  who are become the  Contempt of  EUROPE  BUT while I defend and  honour  the  Profession  I mean not to flatter the  Professors  As far therefore as the Influence of  their  Conduct and Knowledge can be supposed to affect the  national Capacity  so far they seem falling into the same unmanly and effeminate Peculiarities by which their Contemporaries are distinguished Such of them I mean as have Opportunity of conversing with what is called  the World  and are supposed to make a Part of it In their Conduct they  curb not  but  promote  and encourage the trifling Manners of the Times It is grown a fashionable thing among these Gentlemen to despise the Duties of their Parish to wander about as the various Seasons invite to every Scene of false Gaiety to  frequent  and  shine  in all  public  Places their own  Pulpits  excepted  OR if their Age and Situation sets them above these puerile Amusements are we not to lament that instead of a manly and rational Regard to the Welfare of Mankind the chief Employment of many a clerical Life is to slumber in a  Stall  haunt  Levees  or follow the gainful Trade of  Electionjobbing  IF false Pleasure and SelfInterest thus take Possession of the Heart how can we expect  that a Regard for Religion and Christianity should find a  Place  there  IN Consequence of these ruling Habits must we not farther lament that a general Neglect of  Letters  is now creeping even upon this Profession which ought to maintain and support them Instead of launching into the  Deeps  of Learning the fashionable  Divine  hardly ventures on the  Shallows  The great Works of  Antiquity  the Monuments of ancient Honour and Wisdom are seldom  opened  or  explored  and even mere  modern  Books are now generally read at  second Hand  through the false Mediums of bald  Translations  or sorry  Abstracts  THIS seems to be the real State of the  clerical  Profession so far as it hath Influence on the  national Capacity  THE Writer pretends not in any Case to impose his Opinions but submits them to the Consideration of the Public There is a wide Difference between the  Remonstrances  of  Reason  and the  Insults  of  Malice  or  Contempt  SECT III Of the national Spirit of Defence  HAVING seen how the Manners of the Times have levelled the national  Capacity  let us next enquire how it fares with the national Spirit of  Defence  As this Part of our Subject naturally involves a larger Number of the Community than the last it will be necessary here to take a larger Compass  THE national Spirit of  Defence  then to speak with Precision will always be compounded  of the national bodily  Strength Hardiness Courage  and  Principle  THE  common People  of this Nation seem possessed of the  three  first of these four Qualities in a Degree sufficient to form an effectual and national Spirit of Defence And though they who are selected for public  Service  be commonly most  profligate  in Manners yet as their  Sphere  of Action is  confined  they commonly have a proportioned  kind of Principle  which works its Effect in Battle In the Land Service they are zealous for the  Honour  of their  Platoon  their  Company  their  Regiment  At Sea there is the same Emulation whose  Gun  whose  Ship  whose  Squadron  shall be best  served  and  fought  It is well known there are no better fighting Men upon Earth They seldom turn their Backs upon their Enemy unless when their  Officers shew the Way and even then are easily rallied and return to the Charge with the same Courage  THUS our  Villages  and  Ports  are an effectual Fund of Supplies for the national Spirit of Defence in its inferior Departments  BUT if we rise or rather  descend  to an impartial View of those who are called the  better Sort  we shall find such a general Defect in the Spirit of  Defence  as would alarm any People who were not lost to all Sense of  Danger  OUR effeminate and unmanly Life working along with our IslandClimate hath notoriously produced an Increase of  low Spirits  and  nervous Disorders  whose  natural and unalterable Character is that of  Fear  AND even where this Distemper  is not  the present false Delicacy of the fashionable World effectually disqualifies them from  enduring Toil  or  facing Danger  ENTHUSIASTIC Religion leads to  Conquests  rational Religion leads to rational  Defence  but the modern Spirit of  Irreligion  leads to  rascally  and abandoned  Cowardice  It quenceth every generous Hope that can enlarge the Soul and levels Mankind with the Beasts that perish  CAN the Debility of modern Honour produce the manly Spirit of Defence Alas if ever it is put in Action by any thing beyond the  Vanity  of  Shew  it is rouzed by an  Affront  and dies in a  Duel  How far this dastard Spirit of Effeminacy hath crept upon us and destroyed the national Spirit of Defence may appear from the general  Panic  the Nation was thrown into at the late  Rebellion  When those of every Rank above a Constable instead of arming themselves and encouraging the  People  generally fled before the  Rebels  while a Mob of ragged Highlanders marched unmolested to the Heart of a populous Kingdom  NAY so general was this cowardly and effeminate Spirit that it was not confined to the  Friends  of Liberty and  Britain  In  England  it infected even their  Enemies  who while the hardy  Scots  risqued their Lives in a strange Country amidst the Inclemencies of a severe Season sat like Cowards by the Chimney Corner tamely  wishing the Success of that Mischief which their effeminate Manners durst not propagate  IT hath been urged indeed as a Proof that the national Spirit of Defence is not yet extinguished that we raised such large Sums during that Rebellion and still continue such plentiful Supplies for the Support of our Fleets and Armies This is weak Reasoning For will not  Cowardice  at least as soon as  Courage  part with a Shilling or a Pound to avoid  Danger  The capital Question therefore still remains  "Not who shall  Pay  but who shall  Fight"  MONEY it is true hath of late more than ever been among  us  regarded as the main  Engine of War  How truly let our  Successes  tell the WorldThis Point will  hereafter be treated more at large  See Part the Third  In the mean Time it cannot be amiss to observe that a  little  of the active  Spirit  of  Courage  would do well in order to  give Play  to this boasted  Engine  which otherwise may sink into a  dead  and  unactive Mass  FOR a natural Display therefore of the Genius of the Times commend me to the frank Declaration of an  honest  Gentleman during the impending Terror of a  French  Invasion  "For my Part I am no  Soldier  and therefore think it no Disgrace to own myself  a Coward Here  is my Purse at the Service of my Country If the  French  come  I'll pay  buttake me  if I fight"  HOW many modern fine Gentlemen notwithstanding the warlike Weapon at their Side would make the same  Declaration  had they the same  Sincerity  THERE is another Circumstance in modern Manners the Consideration of which must not be omitted because at first View it bids fair for the Spirit of Defence among the  Great  I mean the Spirit of  deliberate Selfmurder  For this ran high in ancient GREECE and ROME when the Spirit of  Defence  was  strong  FOR the clearing of this Point it must be premised and confessed that something  like  the Principle of  Honour  that is the  Dread  of  Infamy  and  Shame  appears the leading Motive in both Instances  BUT a farther Dictinction is to be made with Regard to the different Objects of this  Fear  And for this we must refer to a former Section * There we have seen that the ruling  Pride  of a  modern  man of Fashion lies in the Parade of  Dress Gaming Entertainments  and  Equipage  whereas on the contrary the  Ambition  of an old  Roman  was to excel in  military Virtue  Now this Dictinction at once clears up the Question we are upon and confirms much of what hath been advanced on modern Principles and Manners The  Roman  killed himself because he had been unfortunate in  War  the  Englishman  because he hath been unfortunate at  Whist  The  old  Hero because he had  disgraced  his  Country  the  modern  because he dares not shew his Head at  Arthur's  That  Part i Sect  because he was deprived of his  Glory  this of his  Ortolans  and  Champaigne  The first was encouraged by a  mistaken  Principle of Religion the latter by his being  void  of all Religion The one because he had lost a  Battle  or a  Province  the other because the Bailiff hath seized his  Equipage  The  Roman  was impelled to  SelfDestruction  by the Strength of  warlike Honour  the  Briton  by  despicable  and  effeminate Vanity  WHERE then shall we seek for the genuine Spirit of Defence Where in Truth should we most seek for it but among those who are our  Defenders  by  Profession  BUT  "what Probability is there that the Spirit of Defence should be strong in any Profession when the Members of that Profession are all chosen without  prior Culture or Preparation from a People among whom the Spirit of Defence is lost"  The Truth implied in this Question is so evident in itself that it is hard to go about to prove it Can a mere Change of  Dress  or  Title  or the buckling on a military  Weapon  infuse Strength Hardiness Courage or Honour These are Qualities that must either be natural which seldom happens or they must be infused by an early and continued Discipline or else they come not at all Schools and Seminaries of this Kind we have none or none that are in any Degree attended to The young Men designed for the military Profession are bred up to the same effeminate Maxims and Manners which their Fathers are proud of Can we wonder if these shoot into Action and form parallel Characters Well might we wonder if they  did not  SO then if it appear by our present Success in War that our naval and military Spirit of Defence is strong it must be evident at the same Time that this great Spirit is infused by some Means altogether supernatural  IN the mean Time what becomes of the four great natural Hinges on which the true Spirit of Defence must hang  Strength Hardiness Courage  and  Principle  CAN the modern System of false Delicacy nerve the Warrior with Hardiness and Strength These Qualities I believe are hardly  boasted  as making any Part of the modern warlike Character It is a prudent as well as a modest Part indeed not to throw these rough and antiquated Weights  into the present military Scale For every common Eye would detect the false Pretension  BUT tho' brutal Strength and unpolished Hardiness be gone are not our  Army  and  Navy  the great  Schools  of  Courage  and  Honour  where these shining Qualities are of Course obtainedTruly it hath long been so affirmed So long that the  Affirmation  hath till of late passed for  Proof  But the Nation is now beginning to grow  sceptical  in this Point and require something more than  Affirmation  for the Support of an Article of such  Importance  LET us first weigh the Probability of this from the Nature of Things and Men True  Courage  and a Principle of  Honour  if they be not the rare and generous Growths of  Nature  are the Effect of  early  and  continued Habits  Tho'  grown  Gentlemen may learn to  Dance  yet their Movements will be none of the most  graceful  And tho' grown Gentlemen repair to the School of Courage and Honour yet with all their preconceived Maxims of false Delicacy their trifling Ambitions and effeminate Manners about them I ween they are like to make a  sorry Progress  Long before this the Mind hath taken its  decisive Cast  of  Thought  and can but rarely be brought back from its first  Obliquities  BUT suppose the Possibility of this sudden Infusion It is to be feared the Consequence would fail us It is true that when  Armies  take the  Field  and  Fleets  put to  Sea  when Sieges are undertaken and Battles fought and Glory is the Prize of Toil and Dangerthen indeed  Armies and Navies become the Schools of Courage and warlike Honour Here is a strong and continued Bias put upon the Mind of every Individual of Force to conquer it's earliest Obliquities But where nothing of this happens where  Land Officers  in the Capital are occupied in  Dress Cards  and  Tea  and in Country Towns divide their Time between Milleners  Shops  and  Taverns  and  Sea Officers  even in Time of War instead of annoying the Enemies Fleets are chiefly busied in the gainful Trade of catching  Prizes  in such a Case the Army must of necessity be the  School  not of  Honour  but  Effeminacy  the  Navy  the School of  Avarice  to the  Ends of Effeminacy  HOW far these general Reasonings are confirmed by a Series of  recent Events  the World is left to judge It is not the  Writer's Intention to make personal Applications but to trace acknowledged  Facts  to their  Principles  and  Consequences  SECT IV Of the national Spirit of Union  THESE accumulated Proofs may convince us that the national Spirit of  Defence  is not less weakened than the national  Capacity  by the Manners and Principles of the Times Let us next weight their various Effects on the national Spirit of  Union  IT may be proper to preface this Part of the Estimate by observing that whereas a national  Capacity  and Spirit of  Defence  are not necessarily affected by a national Form of  Government  the national Spirit of  Union  on the contrary is naturally  strong  under  some  Forms and naturally  weak  under  others  IT is naturally  strong  in  absolute Monarchies  because in the Absence both of Manners and Principles the  compelling  Power of the  Prince  directs and draws every thing to one Point and therefore in all common Situations effectually supplies their Place  BUT in  free Countries  it is naturally  weak  unless supported by the generous Principles of Religion Honour or public Spirit For as in most Cases a full national Union will require that the separate and partial Views of private Interest be in some Degree sacrificed to the general Welfare so where Principle prevails not the national  Union must ever be thwarted or destroyed by selfish Views and separate Interests  ANOTHER Circumstance must be remarked by which in free Countries the national Union will accidentally be often checked but not destroyed I mean by the Freedom of  Opinion  itself urged into Act by the very Strength of generous and prevailing  Principle  THIS Distinction leads us to observe what may perhaps be deemed an Overfight or Inaccuracy of the celebrated MONTESQUIEU He hath often given it as his Opinion that  Factions  are not only natural but necessary to  free  Governments And this general Rule he gives without Restriction Thus he speaks of  Rome  "On n'entend parler dans les auteurs que des divisions qui perdirent  Rome mais on ne voit pas que ces Divisions y étoient  necessaires  qu'elles y avoient toujours été qu'elles y  devoient toujours etre  Grandeur des Rom l ix  "  How far this Proposition is  true  or  false  the Distinction made above will lead us to discover When the Spirit of Union is checked and Divisions arise from the Variety and  Freedom  of  Opinion  only or from the contested Rights and Privileges of the different Ranks or Orders of a State not from the detached and selfish Views of Individuals a Republic is then in its  Strength  and gathers Warmth and Fire from these Collisions Such was the State of ancient  Rome  in the simpler and more disinterested Periods of that Republic  BUT when Principle is weakened and Manners lost and Factions run high from  selfish Ambition Revenge or Avarice a Repubiic is then on the very Eve of its Destruction And such was the State of Rome in the Times of MARIUS and SYLLA POMPEY and CESAR ANTHONY and AUGUSTUS  THEREFORE before we can determine whether the  Factions  that divide a  free  Country be  salutary  or  dangerous  it is necessary to know what is their  Foundation  and their  Object  If they arise from  Freedom  of Opinion and aim at the public Welfare they are  salutary  If their Source be  selfish  Interest of what kind soever they are then  dangerous  and  destructive  IT was necessary to make these Distinctions before we could say with Precision how far in our own Country a  national Spirit of Union  is in reality a  national  GOOD  THE Point therefore to be examined is  "how far our national Spirit of Union is weakened or destroyed by selfish Views of Good by separate Interests and Defect of Principle"  Now if the Delineation already given of our ruling Manners and Principles be true the Consequence must needs follow that our national Spirit of Union must be shaken by them  NEITHER shall we need to cast about for evident Facts that will confirm this Theory Glaring Proofs will meet us at every Turn and not only make good this Conclusion but throw new Light on the Delineation already made  THE Restraints laid on the royal Prerogative at the Revolution and the Accession  of Liberty thus gained by the People produced two Effects with Respect to Parliaments One was that instead of being  occasionally  they were thenceforward  annually  assembled The other was that whereas on any trifling Offence given they had been usually  intimidated  or  dissolved  they now found themselves possessed of new  Dignity  and  Power  their Consent being necessary for raising the  annual Supplies  NO Body of Men except in the simplest and most virtuous Times ever found themselves possessed of Power but many of them would attempt to turn it to their own private Advantage Thus the Parliaments finding themselves  of Weight  and finding at the same Time that the Disposal of all  lucrative Employments  was vested in the  Crown  soon bethought themselves  that in Exchange for  their  Concurrence in granting Supplies and forwarding the  Measures  of  Government  it was but equitable that the Crown should  concur  in vesting  Them  or their  Dependants  with the  lucrative Employs  of State  IF this was done the Wheels of Government ran smooth and quiet But if any large Body of Claimants was dissatisfied the political Uproar began and public Measures were obstructed or overturned  WILLIAM the  third  found this to be the national Turn and set himself like a Politician to oppose it He therefore silenced all he could by Places or Pensions And hence the Origin of MAKING of PARLIAMENTS  BUT the Art as yet was but in its  infant  State The ruling Principles which had brought about the REVOLUTION had not as yet lost their Force And the first Essays of Art are always rude Time only and Variety of Trial and Experiment can form them into perfect Systems  IN the mean Time this new Principle of SelfInterest began to work deeper every Day in its Effects As a Seat in Parliament was now found to be of considerable selfish Importance the Contention for  Gain  which had begun in  Town  spread itself by Degrees into the  Country Shires  and  Burroughs  which in former Times had  paid  their Representatives for their Attendance in Parliament were now the great Objects of  Request  and  political Struggle  AND as the  Representatives  had already found their Influence and made their Demands on the  Crown  so now the  Constituents  found  their  Influence and made  their  Demands on the  Representatives  THUS the great Chain of political SelfInterest was at length formed and extended from the  lowest Cobler  in a  Burrough  to the  King's first Minister  BUT a  Chain  of  SelfInterest  is indeed no better than a  Rope  of  Sand  There is no  Cement  nor  Cohesion  between the Parts There is rather a mutual  Antipathy  and  Repulsion  the Character of  SelfInterest  being in a peculiar Sense that of  "teres atque rotundus"  wrapt up wholly in  itself  and unconnected with others unless for its own Sake Here then we see even this Chain itself ready to  fall in Pieces and on any sudden Thwart or Concussion break into an Infinity of Factions  BESIDES this the lucrative Employs of our Country not being near so numerous as the Claimants are in every Degree of political Power and Expectation the Spirit of selfish Faction arose of course in its Strength from unsatisfied Demands and disappointed Avarice  IT hath much been debated whether the Ministers or the People have contributed more to the Establishment of this System of SelfInterest and Faction On Enquiry it would probably appear that at different Periods the Pendulum hath swung at large on both sides It came down in former Times from the Minister to the Representative from the Representative to  the managing Alderman from the Alderman to the Cobler In later Times the Impulse seems to have been chiefly in the contrary Direction From the Cobler to the managing Alderman from him to the Member from the Member to the  great Man  who ruled the Burrough and thence to the Minister Thus what was formerly in the Minister an Act of  supposed Prudence  has of late grown into an Act of  supposed Necessity  The  Cobler  by this Time had found his  Strength  so the Pressure went  upwards  till it came upon the  Ministry  To suppose that the Servants of the Crown never attempted Measures that were known to be bad nor ever  made  Parliaments in order to carry their Attempts into Action would be ridiculous But on the other hand it is equally true  what MACHIAVEL somewhere delivers as a Maxim  "That an illdisposed Citizen can do no great Harm but in an illdisposed City"  Bribery in the Minister supposes a corrupt People  AND to venture a plain tho' perhaps an unpopular Truth on this Occasion it must be owned that a Minister is not therefore  certainly  corrupt in his  Intention  because he  makes  a Parliament by indirect and corrupt  Means  This Conduct however indefensible may arise from two opposite Causes He may be  afraid  of the  Virtue  of a Nation in its  opposing bad  Measures Or he may not dare to  rely  on the  Virtue  of a Nation in  supporting  him in  good ones  THERE was a noted Minister in this Kingdom who during his long Reign  seems to have put these two Maxims in Practice as Occasion offered For if it was his Maxim  "that every Man had his Price"  It was his Maxim too  "That he was obliged to bribe the Members not to vote  against  but  according  to their  Conscience"  HOWEVER this is not meant as a Vindication of his Measures On the contrary they seem generally to have aimed no higher than to secure present Expedients to oblige his Friends and Dependants and provide for his own Safety His Capacity even when he meant well seems to have been too narrow to comprehend any  great Plan  of Legislation and perhaps his Character might be drawn in these few Words  "That while he seemed to  strengthen  the  Superstructure  he  weakened  the  Foundations  of our  Constitution"  BUT however defective Ministers may have been in making the public Welfare the  main Object  of their Views we may be satisfied by this Estimate of Things from the  Revolution  to the present Times that the Nation have at least marched  "Passibus aequis"  And tho' this Work is not intended either as a Defence or an Accusation of Ministers yet for the sake of Truth it must be said that the eternal Clamours of a selfish and a factious People against every Ministry that rises puts one in Mind of those  Carthaginian  Armies which being at once cowardly and insolent ran away at Sight of an Enemy and then  crucified  their  General  because he did not gain the  Victory  To return therefore to our Subject if indeed we have departed from it evident  it is that the want of Principle hath at length firmly established a System of political SelfInterest among us which must at all times break out into Factions and prevent the great Effects which a national Spirit of Union would produce Former Times we plainly see have been fatally infected with this selfish Spirit Present Times  in this respect  are  sacred  and therefore we speak not of them But if the ruling Manners and present want of Principle in this Kingdom be not checked in their Carriere we must expect that future Times will be more selfish and therefore more factious than those former ones we have already described  FOR Vanity Luxury and Effeminacy increased beyond all Belief within these twenty Years as they are of a  selfish  so are they of a craving and unsatisfied Nature  The present Rage of Pleasure and unmanly Dissipation hath created a Train of new Necessities which in their Demands outstrip every possible Supply  AND if the great Principles of Religion Honour and public Spirit are weak or lost among us what effectual Check can there be upon the Great to controul their unbounded and unwarranted Pursuit of lucrative Employments for the Gratification of these unmanly Passions  And whenever this happens what can we expect as the Consequence but a general Anarchy and Confusion what but that disappointed  Avarice  will kindle  Faction  That national Union must be thwarted by selfish Regards That no public Measure however salutary can be carried into Act  if it clash with any foreseen private Interest  NAY is it not the Duty of every Wellwisher to his Country to consider not only how soon this  may be  but how far  it is  our present Situation  WHAT other Effect can naturally arise from the Vanity Dissipation and Rapacity of a dissolute People For in a Nation so circumstanced 'tis natural to imagine that next to Gaming and Riot the chief Attention of the great World must be turned on the Business of  Electionjobbing  of securing  Counties  controuling bribing or buying of  Burroughs  in a word on the Possession of a great Parliamentary Interest  But what an Aggravation of this Evil would arise should ever those of the highest Rank tho' prohibited by Act of Parliament insult the Laws by interfering in Elections by solliciting Votes or procuring others to sollicit them by influencing Elections in an avowed Defiance of their Country and even  selling  vacant  Seats  in Parliament to the  best Bidder  WOULD not this be a faithful Copy of degenerate and declining  Rome  "Ea demum Romae libertas est non Senatum non Magistratus non Leges non Mores Majorum non Instituta Patrum vereri"  AND what can we suppose would be the real Drift of this illegitimate Waste of Time Honour Wealth and Labour might not  the very Reason publickly assigned for it be this  "That they may strengthen themselves and Families and thus gain a  lasting Interest  as they call it for their Dependants Sons and Posterity"  Now what would this imply but a supposed Right or Privilege of demanding lucrative Employs as the chief Object of their View And whence can this supposed Privilege of Demand derive its Force but from a foreseen Power and determined Purpose of kindling Faction and obstructing all public Measures in case of Disappointment and Disgust  WE see then how the political System of SelfInterest is at length compleated and a Foundation laid in our Principles and Manners for  endless Dissentions  in the State  THUS  Faction  is established not on  Ambition  but on  Avarice  on  Avarice  and  Rapacity  for the Ends of  Dissipation  NEED we point out particular Facts in Confirmation of these Truths Is not the Nation even now labouring under this fatal Malady Is not the deadly  Bowstring  already stretched and the  Public  gasping and expiring under the Tugs of opposed and contending Parties  "Distractam laceratamque Rempublicammagis  quorum in manu sit  quam  ut incolumis sit  quaeri  Liv  "  SECT V Of the Consequences of National Disunion  IT is not enough to have shewn in what Manner our Defect of Principle and ruling Manners have compleated the Ruin of the national Spirit of Union If we would obtain a full View of our Subject it is a necessary tho' disagreeable Task to trace this  Disunion  thro' its  particular Effects  NOW these will always vary along with the Character of the People thus divided If the Nation be  warlike  and the Spirit of Defence be  strong  the Danger will generally arise from  within  If the Nation be  effeminate  and the Spirit of Defence be  weak  the Danger will generally arise from  without  The first of these was the Situation and Fate of the ancient Military Republics That of  Corinth  was destroyed by the Faction of the  Praetor  DIAEUS and his Party The  Athenian  Commonwealth was again and again shaken and overturned by the Weight of opposing Parties insomuch that the History of this  Republic  may justly be styled the History of  Faction  When degenerate Manners had destroyed the Purity of the  Spartan  Constitution and Laws of LYCURGUS AGIS attempted to restore them but was murdered in the generous Attempt by a Faction headed by the  Ephori  The  Roman  Commonwealth in its later Periods was thrown into perpetual Convulsions by ambitious and warlike Faction and died at last of the Malady And to pass by many other Proofs that might be  alledged what Rivers of Blood have been spilt in  our own Country  among contending Factions while the Spirit of Arms and Honour remained among us  BUT to give every Period of Manners it's due Character it is confessed that in the present  effeminate  tho'  factious  Times we have no Danger of this kind to fear For as our Manners are degenerated into those of Women so are our Weapons of Offence  BUT as this  HomeSecurity  arises only from the common  Impotence  it is probable that other Nations may soon know of what Materials we are made and therefore our Danger is likely to arise from  without  LET us then examine what Effects this national Spirit of  Disunion  must have upon  us as we stand affected by any  foreign Enemy  It weakens the  Consistency  of all public Measures So that no great national Scheme of Thought can be carried into Action if it's Accomplishment demands any long Continuity of Time  IT weakens not only the  Consistency  but the  Vigour  and Expedition of all publick Measures So that while a divided People are contending about the Means of Security or Defence a united Enemy may surprize and invade them  These are the apparent Consequences of national Disunion There is another not so obvious and therefore more likely to be fatal  WE have seen that in a Nation circumstanced like  ours  the great Contention among those of Quality and Fortune will probably lie in the Affair of  Election Interests  That next to effeminate Pleasure and Gaming this for the same End as Gaming will of Course be the capital Pursuit that this Interest will naturally be regarded as a kind of  FamilyFund  for the Provision of the younger Branches and that it's Force must arise from this Principle that in Case the Head of the Family is not  gratified  in his lucrative Demands he and his Dependants will raise a  Combustion  in the State  VIEWING the Affair then in this Light we shall see that besides the general ill Influence of Faction this Principle of Disunion must farther tend to weaken or destroy  both the National  Capacity  and the national Spirit of  Defence  FOR in a Nation so circumstanced thro' the Strength of this Principle many high and important Posts in every public and important Profession must of Course be filled by Men who instead of  Ability  and  Virtue  plead this  Interest  for their  best Title  THUS in a Time when Science Capacity Courage Honour Religion Public Spirit are rare the remaining  Few  who possess these Virtues will often be shut out from these Stations which they would fill with Honour while every public and important Employ will abound with Men whose  Manners  and  Principles  are of the  newest Fashion  'Tis acknowledged there are Exceptions to the Truth of this Remark Nay were  it necessary the Writer could gratify his Vanity by ranking some of these Names in the Number of his Friends But notwithstanding these Exceptions the general Observation will maintain it's Truth  How indeed can it be otherwise while the Consciousness of this Principle has any Place in the Mind Is not the ParliamentInterest of every powerful Family continually rung in the Ears of it's Branches and Dependants And does not this inevitably tend to relax and weaken the Application of the young Men of Quality and Fortune and render every Man who has Reliance on this Principle less qualified for those Stations  which  BY THIS VERY PRINCIPLE he  obtains  For why should a Youth of Family or Fashion thus he argues with himself  "Why should  He  submit to the Drudgery of Schools Colleges Academies  Voyages Campaigns Fatigues and Dangers when he can rise to the highest Stations by the smooth and easy Path of Parliamentary Interest"  'Tis granted indeed that the Sons and Relations of Men of Quality and Fortune have not only an equal but even a prior Claim to all high Employments in the State provided only they are  qualified to fill them honourably  WE may truly add to this that in that Period of a State when Capacity Courage and Honour form its ruling Character those of high Quality and Degree are generally of all others the most capable most couragious most honourable  ON the contrary where Effeminacy and selfish Vanity form the ruling Character of  a People there we may be no less certain that those of high Rank and Quality will in general be of all others most vain most selfish most incapable most effeminate  THE Reason is permanent and the same in both Cases  "Because in every Period of every State "the Influence of the  leading People  soon or late will form it's  leading Character"  HOW far these Truths are verified by present Facts it were  needless  perhaps  dangerous  particularly to say Let it therefore be left to the candid Consideration of every honest and impartial Man how far several recent Events by which both the Honour and outward Strength of this Nation have been impaired have arisen from the prevailing Principle here delineated  WE may conclude this Subject with a general Remark which together with the Result of these Observations may form a general Maxim That "when Factions arise from the Excess of military Spirit and the ambition of Dominion they increase the national Capacity and Spirit of Defence On the contrary where Factions arise from selfish Effeminacy the national Capacity and Spirit of Defence will certainly be weakened or destroyed  WE must not omit to observe that there are two Professions which even in the most selfish and effeminate Times will generally maintain their proper Vigour These are the Professions of  Law  and  Physic  For as their Object is the Security of the  Property  and  Health  of Individuals the most selfish and effeminate of Mankind will always be more attentive to the Preservation of  these  in proportion as they are  less attentive  to the public Welfare and lost to all generous Affections and Regards Thus even in the most selfish and effeminate Times the ablest  Lawyers  and  Physicians  will generally be at the Head of their Profession    SUCH are the Effects of this prevailing Principle of SelfInterest and Disunion in  high Life  But if we take into the Account all that despicable Train of political Managers Agents and BurroughJobbers which hang like Leeches upon the Great nor ever quit their Hold till they are full gorged we shall then see this reigning Evil in it's last Perfection For here to Incapacity and Demerit is generally added  Insolence  Every low Fellow of this Kind looks upon the Man of Genius Capacity and Virtue as his natural Enemy He regards him with an evil Eye and hence undermines or defames him as one who thwarts his Views questions his Title  and indangers his Expectations He must have had little Experience in the World who has not among  every Order  met with flagrant Characters of this Kind and Instances of this Truth  THUS the public Body is  again  weakened or rather  mutilated  in all its Limbs And that national Spirit of  Disunion  which our Principles and Manners have produced comes not only attended with it's proper and  immediate Effects  but hath completed the Ruin of the national  Capacity  and the national Spirit of  Defence  SECT VI  An Objection drawn from the Manners of the  French  Nation considered  WE might here close our Estimate of the public Effects of the ruling Manners  and Principles of the Times were not the Theory here established on a Number of concurrent Facts apparently liable to an Objection  THIS ariseth from the ruling Manners of the  French  Nation Which being as  vain  and  effeminate  as our own and the very Archetype from which our own are drawn should of Course involve that Nation in the same Consequences the same Defect of national  Capacity Defence  and  Union  But as these Principles of national and internal Strength are on all hands acknowledged to maintain their proper Vigour in  France  where the ruling Manners are effeminate therefore say the Patronizers of our modern Manners  these  cannot be the Cause of our national Miscarriages and Defects  'TIS granted then that their Manners are of the same Kind But on Examination it will appear that whereas  ours  as we have seen are suffered to go on to all their proper and natural Effects  theirs  on the contrary are checked and counteracted in their Effects by a variety of Causes and Principles wholly dissimilar  THEIR effeminate  Manners  affect not their national  Capacity  because their Youth are assiduously trained up for all public Offices civil naval military in Schools provided at the national Expence Here the Candidates for public Employ go thro' a severe and laborious Course of Discipline and only expect to  rise  in  Station  as they  rise  in  Knowledge  and  Ability  THEIR effeminate Manners affect not their national Spirit of  Defence  because they are controuled by the Principle of military  Honour  This for some Ages hath been early instilled into every rising Generation and is at length become so strong and universal as to form the  national Character  It spreads through every Rank inspires even the meanest in the Kingdom and pervades and actuates the whole Machine of Government with a Force little inferior to that of public  Virtue  IT were no incurious Subject to investigate this peculiar Principle to it's first Causes But  that  lies beyond the Intention of the present Design It may be called a  peculiar  Principle in  France  because it is  unconnected  nay even at  Variance  with it's Manners and in no other Country did this  Principle ever subsist in it's Strength when  other  Principles were  weakened  and  Manners lost  IT may seem perhaps at first View to have arisen from the civil Wars that rent the Kingdom in the Time of HENRY  the Great  to have been transfused from thence into the gallant Reign of LOUIS and thence heightened and delivered down to present Times  BUT tho' it received great Heightenings in these two Reigns yet it produced signal and peculiar Effects before the first of these Periods In Proof of this we need only alledge the famous Route called the  Battle of Spurs  when HENRY  the Eighth  of  England  invaded  France  On this Occasion the Body of the  French  Army giving Way thro' some sudden Panic the Officers kept their Ground and rather  chose to be slain or taken Prisoners than give Countenance to such an ignominious Flight  THIS Principle so remarkable at this Day among the FRENCH  we  stigmatize with the Name of  false Honour  Such as it is it were to be wished we had more of it It aims not indeed at  generous  Ends beyond a  certain Sphere  But it is plausible polite and splendid in the Pursuit even of it's ungenerous Ends In short the Honour like the Religion of  France  is not  void  of Benevolence but  confines  its Benevolence within a  certain Pale  'Tis  false  Honour as it regards  other  Nations as it regards  their own Country  it is  true  As this Principle in  France  secures the national Spirit of Defence so the  Power  of their Monarch  aided by this Principle secures their national Spirit of  Union  In consequence of this the World has accidentally seen their vast Plan of Power formed by the great  Colbert  almost a Century ago carried on tho' with frequent Interruptions and in a great Degree now accomplished thro' a Variety of Reigns Wars and Administrations The  Monarch's  Power gives  Unity  and  Steddiness  the Principle of  Honour  gives  Vigour  to every  Movement  of the State  THUS in Contradiction to all known Example  France  hath become powerful while she seemed to lead the Way in Effeminacy And while she hath allured her neighbour Nations by her own Example to drink largely of her  circaean  and  poisoned Cup  of  Manners  hath secured her own  Health  by the  secret Antidote  of  Principle  FORCED by this the Character of the  French  Nation tho' inconsistent is respectable They have found or rather invented the Art of uniting all Extremes They have Virtues and Vices Strengths and Weaknesses seemingly incompatible They are effeminate yet brave insincere yet honourable hospitable not benevolent vain yet subtile splendid not generous warlike yet polite plausible not virtuous mercantile yet not mean In Trifles serious gay in Enterprize Women at the Toilet Heroes in the Field profligate in Heart in Conduct decent Divided in Opinion in Action united In Manners weak but strong in Principle  Contemptible  in  private  Life in  public Formidable  SECT VII Of the most probable Tendency of these Effects  NOTWITHSTANDING this apparent Objection therefore the Principles here advanced maintain their Force And thus we see how our  effeminate Manners  and  Defect  of  Principle  have weakened the national Capacity and Spiri  of Defence and by giving a new Turn to our national  Disunion  have still farther aggravated these ruling Evils in the State  WHAT then is the most probable Consequence of this  national Debility  'TIS from an  outward Enemy  as hath been observed that Danger is most to be apprehended  THE FRENCH in Land Armies are far our Superiors They are making large and dreadful Strides towards us in  naval Power  They have more  than disputed  with us the Empire of the  Mediterranean  They are driving us from our Forts and Colonies in  America  THESE are the steddy Effects of  their  Principles and Union of  our  Deficiency in  both  THESE Causes reach to and operate even in the  new  World  Their Governors  of Colonies are actuated by  Honour  and their  Monarch's Power Ours  too commonly by  SelfLove  and uncontrouled  Rapine Their  Zeal and Policy direct them to make  Converts  and  Friends  of the  Indian Nations Our  Irreligion prevents  the  one  our dishonest Treatment the  other  For by the best Accounts our Colonies have in general copied and even outgone us in every  fashionable Degeneracy  SHOULD the  French  then possess themselves of  North America  what Eye can be so weak as not to see the Consequence Must not a naval Power come upon us  equal  if not superior to our own  THUS by a gradual and unperceived Decline we seem gliding down to Ruin We laugh we sing we feast we play We  adopt  every  Vanity  and  catch  at every  Lure  thrown out to us by the  Nation  that is  planning  our  Destruction  and while Fate is hanging over us are  sightless  and thence  secure  Were we but as  innocent  as  Blind  we should in our  Fondness  for  French  Manners compleatly resemble the  Lamb  described by the  Poet  The Lamb thy Riot dooms to bleed to Day  Had he thy Reason wou'd he skip and play  Pleas'd to the last he crops the flow'ry Food  And  licks  the  Hand  that's  rais'd  to  shed his Blood  PART III OF THE SOURCES OF THESE MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES  PART III OF THE SOURCES OF These MANNERS and PRINCIPLES  SECT I Of a general Mistake on this Subject  THE publick Effects of our Manners and Principles here enumerated begin now to appear too manifest in our public Miscarriages to be any longer derided The Nation stands aghast  at it's own Misfortunes But like a Man starting suddenly from Sleep by the Noise of some approaching Ruin knows neither whence it comes nor how to avoid it  IN Proof of this we need only look into the late Instructions from Constituents to Representatives These we see seldom look farther than the immediate and incidental Occasion of each particular Misconduct While the grand general Principles in which these Misconducts have been chiefly founded are neither seen nor suspected Nay an impartial Enquiry will probably convince us that while they strike at the Shoots and Branches they feed the Root from whence these Misconducts have been originally derived  FOR it seems to be the ruling Maxim of this Age and Nation that if our Trade and  Wealth are but increased we are powerful happy and secure And in estimating the real Strength of the Kingdom the sole Question for many Years hath been  "What Commerce and Riches the Nation is possessed of"  A Question which an ancient Lawgiver would have laughed at  THERE never was a more fatal Error more greedily embraced by any People  SECT II  Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on  Manners  BY Wealth is understood every kind of useful Possession or Money which is it's Sign and may be converted into it  BY Commerce is understood the Exchange of Wealth for mutual Benefit  THE Effects of Commerce on Manners have by most Writers I think been considered as  uniform  Even the sage and amiable MONTESQUIEU says only in general Terms  "That Commerce polishes Manners but corrupts Manners  L'Esprit des Loix l xx c  "  Whereas from a candid View of it's Nature and Effects we shall probably find that in it's first and middle Stages it is beneficent in it's last dangerous and fatal  IF we view Commerce in its first Stages we shall see that it supplies mutual Necessities prevents mutual Wants extends mutual Knowledge eradicates mutual Prejudice and spreads mutual Humanity  IF we view it in its middle and more advanced Period we shall see it provides  Conveniencies increaseth Numbers coins Money gives Birth to Arts and Science creates equal Laws diffuses general Plenty and general Happiness  IF we view it in it's third and highest Stage we shall see it change it's Nature and Effects It brings in Superfluity and vast Wealth begets Avarice gross Luxury or effeminate Refinement among the higher Ranks together with general Loss of Principle  CONCERNING the two first Stages of Commerce I shall have no Dispute with the present Times It's Benefits are generally acknowledged The dangerous Effects of it's Exorbitance or Excess have not yet been sufficiently developed  THAT Commerce in it's Excess brings a general Superfluity of Goods that this general Superfluity settles in particular Hands into vast Wealth will be readily acknowledged  THE next Step is to consider how vast Wealth naturally produces Avarice Luxury or Effeminacy according to the Genius or Circumstances of the People among whom it comes  INDUSTRY in it's first Stages is  frugal  not  ungenerous  It's End being that of SelfPreservation and moderate Enjoyment it's little Superfluities are often employed in Acts of Generosity and Beneficence But the daily Increase of Wealth by Industry naturally increases the  Love  of Wealth The Passion for Money being founded not in Sense but Imagination admits of no Satiety like those which are called the natural Passions Thus the Habit of saving Money beyond every other Habit gathers Strength by continued Gratification The Attention of the whole Man is immediately turned upon it and every other Pursuit held light when compared with the Increase of Wealth Hence the natural Character of the Trader when his final Prospect is the Acquisition of Wealth is that of  Industry  and  Avarice  WHAT is true in this Respect of  trading Men  is true of  trading Nations  If their Commerce be that of Oeconomy in the Extreme if the last Object of their Pursuit be Wealth for it's own Sake if the Leaders of such a People be  commercial  the Character  of that People and it's Leaders will be found in  Industry  and  Avarice  BUT if a trading Nation hath a large  Territory  sufficient to create a  Landed Interest  Commerce will produce very different Effects  FOR as it multiplies Inhabitants and brings in Wealth it naturally increases the Value of landed Estates Barren Grounds are cultivated and cultivated Spots are made more fertile Hence a vast Accession of Income to the Nobility and Gentry  THESE Ranks of Men being not bred up to Habits of Industry on the contrary their increased Rents coming in unsought for and their Time being often a Load upon them thro' want of Capacity and Employment the Habit of  Indulgence  comes on and grows of Course Additional  Wealth gives the Power to gratify every Desire that rises Leisure improves these Desires into Habits thus Money is at length considered as no more than the Means of Gratification and hence the genuine Character of a rich Nobility or Gentry is that of Expence and Luxury  BUT the first Essays of Luxury like those of every other Art are coarse and rude The natural Character of Luxury therefore is to refine by Degrees Especially when assisted by Commerce it advances apace into Refinement For Commerce searches every Shore and Climate for it's Supplies and Art is studious because rewarded in arranging and applying these Materials to the most exquisite and delicate Use Thus every coarser Mode of Pleasure is by Degrees despised new Habits of higher Indulgence come on  gross Luxury is banished and Effeminacy takes it's Place  BUT Luxury in this  last  Period being exhausted in it's Course and turned for want of new Objects of Indulgence into Debility and Languor would expire or sleep were it not awakened by another Passion which again calls it into Action Nothing is so natural to effeminate Minds as  Vanity  This rouzes the luxurious and debilitated Soul and the Arts of pleasurable Enjoyment are now pushed to their highest Degree by the Spirit of delicate Emulation  THUS the whole Attention of the Mind is centred on  Brillancy  and  Indulgence  Money tho' despised as an  End  is greedily sought as a  Means  And  Self  under a different  Appearance from the trading Spirit takes equal Possession of the Soul  THUS as the Character of a State altogether commercial in the highest Degree is that of Industry and Avarice so in a Nation of extended Territory where Commerce is in it's highest Period while it's trading Members retain their Habits of Industry and Avarice the natural Character of it's landed Ranks it's Nobility and Gentry is that of  "a vain luxurious and selfish Effeminacy"  WE speak here of the simple and proper Effects of Trade and Wealth uncontrouled by opposite Manners or Principles which it is to be observed never existed probably at least in the mixed State in their full Extent Individuals there are and will be in almost every State and Period who are  influenced by dissimilar Manners or Principles There are Traders who are generous Nobles and Gentry whose ultimate Passion is for Gold But such Exceptions affect not the general Principle And tho' these incidental Mixtures  Weaken  the different Colours of different Ranks or States yet still the different Colours remain in their Nature distinct and invariable  'TIS probable the Reader will have discovered that this Reasoning is strengthened by or rather built upon the Examples of two neighbour Nation one wholly commercial that of  Holland  The other a mixed State compounded of a commercial and landed Interest I mean  our own  And to say the Truth no two Nations perhaps ever existed which approached so near to the full and proper Effects of the Causes here alledged  IT will appear immediately why the Genius of the Republic of  Holland  is here analysed into its first Principles which are simply those of Industry and the Love of Gain  IN the mean Time we may justly conclude from this Argument that the exorbitant Trade and Wealth of  England  sufficiently account for it's present  Effeminacy  SECT III Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on the religious Principle  SUCH therefore are the ruling Manners which may naturally be expected in a Nation thus circumstanced unless they be  counteracted by opposite Principles 'Tis now Time to consider the natural Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on all those salutary Principles by which these effeminate Manners can most effectually be controuled  LET us still carry the two characteristic States of  Holland  and  England  in our Eye  WHETHER then we view the commercial State where the Love of Money rules or the mixed State where vain Effeminacy predominates we shall find both these national Characters have but a bad Aspect and Influence on every Kind of Principle Let us first consider that of Religion  AVARICE seems not in it's own Nature prone to destroy  speculative  religious Belief but effectually to extinguish  active  religious Principle  IT tends not to destroy speculative Belief because this Effect must be a Work of Application Time and Labour Now the Labour of Avarice is naturally bent on it's main Object  Money  therefore to waste this Labour on the Propagation of the unprofitable and fruitless Doctrines of Irreligion must ever be contrary to it's ruling Character  BUT Avarice naturally tends to the Destruction of active religious Principles because this is chiefly a Matter of  habitual Impression  and therefore in order to accomplish it's Destruction nothing more is  necessary than to  forget  Now this requires no positive Act or Labour of the Mind but is the natural Result from an attentive Pursuit of the favourite Object  Money  HENCE in a mere commercial State actuated by the Love of Gain Religion is not railed at or disputed against but only  neglected  and  forgot  And thus the  genuine Trader  who never questioned the Articles of his national Faith at home scruples not to forswear  Christianity  and tread upon the Cross in  Japan  and returns the same good  Christian  as he went  BUT in the mixed State where national Effeminacy forms the  primary  and Avarice only the  secondary  Character the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on religious Principle will be widely different  LORD  VERULAM  hath somewhere observed that  "Times of Atheism are civil Times"  He had been much nearer the Truth had he affirmed that  "Civil Times are Times of Atheism"  He mistook the Cause for the Effect  THIS Effect of national Luxury and Refinement in producing national Irreligion is not difficult to account for In some Periods of a State Opinions controul Manners but in most Periods Manners controul'Opinions Where the ruling Manners coincide with the common Good as in the middle Periods of a State there we commonly find that a rational and beneficent System of Religion prevails This comes to pass because the Principles of the received Religion contradict not the ruling Manners  BUT in the State and Period of Luxury or Refinement active religious Principle is lost thro' the attentive Pursuit of  Pleasure  as in the commercial State it is lost thro' the attentive Pursuit of  Gain  AND  speculative  Belief in this Period must naturally be lost along with  practical  because  Leisure  and  Literature  having opened the Field of  Disputation  Vice as well as Virtue will of course arm herself with every Weapon of Preservation and Offence Luxury therefore will generally list under the Banner of Irreligion because Religion condemns her Manners Irreligion suffers or approves them  To confirm the Truth of this Reasoning we need only observe that in the Period of refined Luxury  few  but they who are involved  in the  Vices  are involved in the  Irreligion  of the Times  ONE Exception however must be made with Regard to the  Writers  against Religion For  these  though they  promote  yet are not often  involved  in the common Degeneracy This Fact hath been regarded as unaccountable that  sober  Men of Morals apparently  unblameable  should madly unhinge the great Principle of Religion and Society without any visible Motive or Advantage But by looking a little farther into human Nature we shall easily resolve this seeming Paradox These Writers are generally Men of Speculation and Industry and therefore though they give themselves up to the Dictates of their ruling Passion yet that ruling Passion commonly leads to the Tract of  abstemious  Manners That Desire of  Distinction  and  Superiority  so natural  to Man breaks out in a thousand various and fantastic Shapes and in each of these according as it is directed becomes a Virtue or a Vice In Times of Luxury and Dissipation therefore when every Tenet of Irreligion is greedily embraced what Road to  present Applause  can lie so open and secure as that of disgracing religious Belief Especially if the Writer help forward the Vices of the Times by  relaxing Morals  as well as  destroying Principle  Such a Writer can have little else to do but to new model the Paradoxes of ancient  Scepticism  in order to  figure it  in the World and be regarded by the Smatterers in Literature and Adepts in Folly as a Prodigy of Parts and Learning Thus his  Vanity  becomes deeply criminal and is execrated by the Wise and Good because it is gratified at the Expence of his Country's Welfare But the  Consolation  which degenerate Manners receive from his fatal Tenets is  repaid by eager  Praise  And  Vice  impatiently drinks in and  applauds  his hoarse and boding Voice while like a  Raven  he sits croaking universal Death Despair and Annihilation to the human Kind  THUS where Manners and Religion are opposed nothing is so natural as that the  one  should bear down the  other  If Religion destroy not the ruling Manners  these  will gather Strength and destroy Religion  ESPECIALLY in a Country where Freedom is established and Manners lost through the Exorbitance of Wealth the Duration of religious Principles can be but short Despotism arms itself with Terror and by checking the open and avowed  Profession  checks in a certain Degree the  Progress  of  Impiety  Whereas it must be  acknowledged and lamented as one of the unalterable Defects of a free Government that  Opinion  must have its Course The Disease is bad but the Cure would be fatal Thus Freedom is compelled to admit an  Enemy  who under the Pretence and Form of an  Ally  often proves her  Destroyer  SECT IV Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on the Principle of Honour  IN the mixed State where Luxury and Effeminacy form the ruling Character of a People the Excess of Trade and Wealth naturally tends to weaken or destroy the Principle of  Honour  by fixing the Desire of Applause and the Fear of Shame on improper and ridiculous Objects Instead of the Good of others or the Happiness of  the Public the Object of Pursuit naturally sinks into some unmanly and trifling Circumstance The Vanity of Dress Entertainments Equipage Furniture of course takes Possession of the Heart  BUT in the pure commercial State where the Love of Gain predominates among the higher Ranks the Desire of Applause and Fear of Shame are not  perverted  but  extinguished  The Lust of Gold swallows up every other Passion and a Nation of this Character can without Emotion stand the Laughter and Contempt of  Europe  and say with the Miser  Populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo  Ipse Domi simulac Nummos contemplor in Area  IN whatever Shape therefore the Passion for Applause appear whether it assume  the fantastic Form of Vanity the more solemn one of Pride or the steady and elevated Desire of rational Esteem we shall find this Excess of national Avarice tends to its Extinction A great Writer indeed hath told us that  "Vanity creates Industry  L'Esprit des Loix l xix l  "  which is true Notwithstanding this we have seen above that Industry in the Excess naturally begets Avarice and Avarice in the Excess works a total Change in the Soul and expels that Vanity which gave it birth  THE same great Writer hath told us  "that Pride destroys Industry  Ibid  "  the Reverse of which holds equally true  "that Industry destroys Pride"  We speak here of Pride in the blameable Sense as when it riseth into blind and overbearing  Insolence  Industry in the moderate Degree tends to destroy this contemptuous Spirit by introducing Knowledge and Equality and in this Respect as in most others is attended with excellent Effects  BUT the Spirit of Trade in its Excess by introducing Avarice destroys the Desire of  rational Esteem  In Confirmation of this we need only cast our Eyes on the HOLLANDERS and CHINESE among whom the trading Spirit is almost in its unmixed Perfection The one is the most  mercenary  the other the most  thieving  of all Nations  SECT V Of their Effects on public Spirit  THIS Part of our Subject needs little Investigation For both in the commercial  and mixed State it appears that exorbitant Trade and Wealth tend naturally to turn all the Attention of Individuals on  selfish  Gratification  THEREFORE they must of course generally tend to destroy the Principle of public Spirit because  this  implies that our Attention and Regard is turned on  others  IN the commercial State Avarice represents  Wealth  in the mixed State Effeminacy represents  Pleasure  as the  chief Good  Both these Delusions tend to the Extinction of public Spirit  THESE Delusions create a new Train of Wants Fears Hopes and Wishes All these terminating in selfish Regard naturally destroy every Effort of generous and public Principle  SECT VI Farther Remarks on this Subject  IN Consequence of these Remarks some farther Distinctions will arise  THUS the religious Principle will  seem  to exist in the commercial State where Avarice forms the national Character while in the mixed State where Luxury and Effeminacy predominate it is evidently destroyed The Reason is that in the first although active Principle is lost speculative Belief is not controverted Whereas in the latter not only active Principle is lost but Religion itself if such a State be free is publickly insulted and derided Thus in  Holland  Religion  seems  yet to exist while in  England  it is evidently destroyed  ON the contrary the Principle of Honour will seem to exist in the mixed State where luxurious Effeminacy forms the primary Character of the Nation while in the commercial State where Avarice predominates the Principle is evidently no more The Reason is that in the former the Love of Applause and Fear of Shame are not wholly destroyed but perverted and turned upon unworthy Objects while in the latter the Passion itself is totally extinguished Thus the faint Appearance of Honour yet remains in  England  while in  Holland  it is manifestly destroyed  BUT as modern  Dutch  Religion and modern  English  Honour seem no more than the Ghosts of departed Principles so they have precisely those Effects which  may reasonably be expected from such shadowy NonEntities  AGAIN The Colours or Characters of Industry and Avarice will naturally be  strong  in the commercial State because being almost wholly unmixed with Manners of a dissimilar Nature the ruling Genius of the State is left uncontrouled to its proper Operations and Effects  BUT in the mixed State where Industry and Love of Gain form the Character of the  secondary  Ranks Dissipation and Effeminacy of the  higher  there the two separate Characters by the Force of incidental Coalition and Example will always influence each other in a certain Degree Some ambitious Traders will aspire to luxurious Effeminacy Some of the higher Orders will descend to Industry and Merchandise  Thus each Rank must be tinctured with a Colour different from its own and hence the general Colour or Character of each of these Ranks will in some measure be controuled and  weakened  THIS Circumstance is favourable to the mixed State beyond that which is purely commercial as it checks in a certain Degree the Virulence of the Excess and produceth a national Character in some Measure approaching that of more moderate Trade and Wealth  HENCE too it follows that a State purely commerical when once arrived at the Period of exorbitant Wealth will naturally degenerate  faster  than that which is compounded of Commerce and Luxury For whatever Causes check the ruling Manners  in their  Degree  will check them in their  Consequences  BUT beyond this there is another Reason why the State purely commercial will degenerate faster than the mixed State In the commercial State the ruling Manners go Hand in Hand with the Exorbitance of Wealth because the Love of Gain which forms the leading Character being likewise the leading Motive must be even prior to this Exorbitance in the Order of our Ideas and therefore in its Effects must be at least contemporary  BUT in the mixed State there will always be a short Period between the national Exorbitance of Wealth and the national Increase of luxurious Effeminacy because Manners once got into a certain Track are not at once thrown out of it  There must be a short Period before the leading Parts of the Nation can  feel  their Increase of Wealth and after this another Period before new and more refined Modes of Pleasure can be invented  HENCE a neighbouring Republic seems to have well nigh filled up the Measure of its Iniquities while  ours  as yet are only rising towards the  Brim  LASTLY though the ruling Manners of such a mixed State are luxurious and effeminate yet its public Measures will be  commercial  First because Commerce is the HandMaid of  Wealth  and therefore of  Pleasure  Secondly because the Idea of national Strength as well Happiness being degenerated into that of Wealth and external Good Commerce will above all Things be naturally encouraged because it is the Means of procuring them  SECT VII A Review of the Argument  THUS our present exorbitant Degree of Trade and Wealth in a mixed State like that of  England  naturally tends to produce luxurious and effeminate Manners in the higher Ranks together with a general Defect of  Principle  And as the internal Strength of a Nation will always depend chiefly on the Manners and Principles of it's leading Members so these effeminate Manners and this Defect of Principle operate powerfully and fatally on the national Conduct and Affairs They have produced a general Incapacity have weakened the national Spirit of Defence have heightened the national Disunion And this national Disunion besides it's proper and immediate Effects being founded in  Avarice for the Ends of Dissipation hath again weakened the small Remainder of publick Capacity and Defence and thus seems to have fitted us for a Prey to the Insults and Invasions of our most powerful Enemy  SECT VIII An Objection considered  THO' this Estimate may appear  just  to those who take an enlarged View of Things in their Principles and Consequences yet I am not ignorant of certain Maxims generally approved and hardly even disputed among modern Politicians which if true would weaken or overturn these accumulated Proofs  THE capital Maxim which seems to include the rest is this  "That vast Trade  and Wealth above all things make a Nation powerful and invincible as they increase it's Numbers enable it to pay it's Fleets and Armies provide continual Supplies for War and thus in the End tire out and defeat every Enemy whose Wealth and Commerce are inferior"  THE Examination of this Maxim will throw many strong collateral Lights upon our main Subject  First it affirms  "That Trade and Wealth make a Nation strong because they make it populous"  This indeed is true of the first and second Periods of Trade and Wealth That it is true of the  third  or  highest  Period of which  England  is now possessed may very reasonably be questioned In the first Period Industry is chiefly  employed in cultivating the Lands in encreasing manufacturing and exchanging the Produce of the Mother Country These Branches of Trade call for vast additional Numbers of Hands and hence an Increase of Numbers naturally ariseth  THE same Effect takes Place in the second Period of Trade so far as home Productions are  exchanged  for foreign ones This Stage of Commerce brings on a fresh Demand of Artificers of new and various Kinds produces and Increase of Labour and therefore of Inhabitants  BUT in the third or highest Period of Trade of which  England  is now possessed there are very extensive Branches of Commerce which bring no new Accession of Numbers to the Commonwealth I mean  all those Branches of Commerce where  Money  is sent and exchanged for  foreign  Goods This Species of Trade occasions little Increase of  Labour  and therefore less of  Numbers  except only of those few who navigate the Vessels thus employed to their respective Ports And as this kind of Trade will always grow and predominate in proportion as a Nation becomes more luxurious and effeminate so for this Reason the highest Stage of Trade is not naturally attended with the highest Increase of Labour nor consequently of  Numbers  as is commonly imagined Besides this in the refined Period additional Art and Experience in Labour prevent in some Measure the Increase of Numbers By the Invention of Machines an equal Degree both of Tillage and Trade is carried on by fewer Hands than in the simpler Periods and therefore the Increase of Numbers is  by no means proportional to the Increase of Commerce and Wealth  BUT these are far from being the only Considerations worth our Notice on this Subject For when we speak of any Stage of Trade we must in Reason take in  every  Circumstance which naturally attends it There are other Causes therefore why Numbers increase not but rather naturally  diminish  in the highest Period of Trade and Wealth  FOR  first  the Vanity and Effeminacy which this exorbitant Pitch of Wealth brings on lessens the Desire of Marriage  Secondly  the Intemperance and Disease which this Period of Trade naturally produceth among the  lower Ranks  in great  Cities bring on in some Degree an Impotence of Propagation  Thirdly  This Debility is always attended with a Shortness of Life both in the Parents and the Offspring and therefore a still farther Diminution of Numbers follows on the whole  MATTER of Fact confirms these Reasonings and lies open to every Man's Observation Since the first Increase of Tillage and Homemanufactures the Increase of Inhabitants hath been great in  England  Since the vast Increase of foreign Commerce the Increase of Numbers is hardly perceivable Nay there is great Reason to believe that upon the whole the Nation is less populous than it was fifty Years ago tho' it's Trade perhaps is doubled Some trading Towns indeed are better  peopled but others are thinned by the Flux of Commerce The Metropolis seems to augment in its Dimensions But it appears by the best Calculations that it's Numbers are diminished And as to the Villages thro'  England  there is great Reason to believe they are in general at a Stand and many of them thinner of Inhabitants than in the Beginning of this Century 'Tis hard to obtain Certainty in this Particular without a general Examination and Comparison But it appears by the Registers of some  Country  Parishes which I have looked into that from the Year to the Number of Inhabitants increased gradually the two Extremes being to each other as to and that from to the present Time the Number has been at a Stand if not rather diminished  BUT suppose what there is no Reason to believe that our present Excess of Trade and Overflow of Wealth have in some Degree increased our  Numbers  yet it will probably appear that they have as much at least impaired our  bodily Strength  For as  Temperance  is the ruling Character of the middle Stage of Commerce so is  Intemperance  of the highest Hence Health and Strength prevail in the first Disease and Debility in the latter This is universally confirmed by Fact Villages abounding with Health commercial Cities with Disease So that an Army taken from the Villages with equal Commanders Arms and Discipline would drive the same Number of debilitated Gindrinkers like a Flock of Geese before them  THE Author of the  Fable of the Bees  made his Boast that the Wisdom of the Legislature had upon his Plan adopted the Encouragement of this pernicious Liquid But the same Wisdom hath upon Trial been obliged to  discourage  the Use of this malignant Spirit as they found that it ruined the Health and shortened the Lives of half the lower Ranks in  London  AND all good Men hope that the Time will come when this infernal Potion will be laid under such Discouragements as may amount to a general Prohibition The Necessity of such a Reformation grows greater every Day not only in  London  but throughout the Kingdom For in some Villages in  England  there is now a greater Quantity of Gin consumed than of Ale  BUT to quit these inferior Considerations tho' they all unite in confirming the Theory here advanced the Weight of the Reply lies indeed in another Circumstance For altho' we should admit what is not true that our present Exorbitance of Trade and Wealth increased our Numbers and bodily Force yet as the real and essential Strength of a Nation consists in the Manners and Principles of it's  leading Part  and as our present Excess of Trade and Wealth hath produced such fatal Effects on these Manners and Principles no Increase of Numbers in the inferior Ranks can possibly make amends for this internal and capital Defect Such a Nation can at best only resemble a large  Body  actuated yet hardly actuated by an incapable a vain a dastardly and effeminate  Soul  BUT the Maxim we are engaged to obviate alledges farther that  "This exorbitant Increase of Trade and Wealth enables a Nation to pay it's Fleets and Armies and afford continual Supplies for War"  Yet even this Part of the Maxim in it's modern Acceptation is far beyond the Truth  FOR under the present Stage of Trade the Increase of Wealth is by no means equally or proportionally diffused The Trader reaps the main Profit after him the Landlord in a lower Degree But the common Artificer and still more the common Labourer gain little by the exorbitant Advance of Trade It is true their Wages are increased but so are the Prices of Provisions too and therefore they are no richer than before  Now Taxes and public Supplies are raised upon the Consumer and as it appears from hence that only a few of the Consumers are made richer by the Exorbitance of Trade it follows that not the Nation in general but a select Number of Individuals only are made more capable of contributing to those Supplies which are levied without Distinction on the  whole  Would they who reap the plenteous Harvest of foreign Trade generously allot their proportional and extraordinary Gains to the Service of the Public we should then indeed be furnished with a  new  Argument in Favour of Commerce in it's highest Pitch  FARTHER As the labouring Ranks are little or nothing enriched by the exorbitant Degree of Trade so it often happens that even the higher Ranks and the Nation in general are not  more  nay perhaps  less  enabled  to contribute to the public Supplies than when possessed of Wealth in a more moderate Degree For we have seen in the Progress of this Estimate that the natural Effect of an Increase of Wealth is an Increase of Luxury Vanity and Expence which if it outrun the Increase of Wealth as in it's Nature it tends to do instead of Riches will bring on public Poverty For the Ability or Wealth of a People considered in their Capacity for raising Supplies consists not in the Largeness of their Income but in the Proportion of their Expences to their Income It consists not in  "what they  have"  but  "what they can  Spare"  Hence it appears that a Nation may be at once very  rich  and very  poor  rich in Income but poor thro' Extravagance And as national Extravagance is the natural Effect of an Overflow of Wealth so national Indigence  is it's most natural and final Consequence How far this is our present Situation can hardly be necessary to affirm  To this Argument it may possibly be objected that if great Wealth is but among us new Imposts will naturally  force  it into Circulation That the more the Artificers and Labourers are taxed the more their Wages will increase and consequently their Ability to bear the increasing Taxes And that as to the higher Ranks exorbitant Wealth  enables  them still better to endure additional Imposts because these deprive the Great of nothing but the Superfluities of Vanity and Luxury  To this it is replied that in Case of additional Taxes tho' the Poor  must  indeed increase their Wages in order to subsist yet this Increase never takes Place till  they are compelled by the last  Necessity  and  Want  The natural Consequence of which must be Murmurs Sedition and Tumults With Regard to the higher Ranks a parallel Reply may suffice For in the refined Period when Manners and Principles are lost the Luxuries of Life become  Necessaries  among the Great and therefore will be as obstinately adhered to and quitted with the same Reluctance as Food and Cloathing by the  Poor  The Consequence therefore must be the same a general Discontent and Disaffection to the Government among the higher Ranks of Life  IS not all this confirmed by evident Facts There is at present in this Nation a Mass of Wealth at least twelve Times more than the publick Debt Yet we are reduced to the sad Necessity of plunging  deeper every Day What is the Reason No Ministry dares to provoke and exasperate a luxurious and selfish Nation by demanding such Sums as every one has the  Power  had he but the  Will  to bestow  BUT beyond all this will any Man of Sense assert that the Circumstance of  paying  an Army or a Fleet is the one thing that will decide a War 'Tis true indeed Provisions Arms Ammunition are necessary and therefore  Wealth  because it procures them But will a General or Admiral therefore gain the Victory only because his Men are furnished with Provisions Arms and Ammunition If not what can Trade or Wealth do towards making a Nation victorious Again therefore let me remind my Countrymen that the capital Question still remains not  "who shall  pay"  "but who shall  fight"  THERE is a trite Observation on Foot indeed drawn from the best political Writers ill understood that  "the Principles of War are wholly changed and that not the Nation who has the best  Troops  but the longest  Purse  will in the End obtain the Victory"  This in the modern Application of it is a most dangerous Maxim It naturally tends to extinguish military Skill as well as Honour and will inevitably sink the People that maintains it into a Nat  on of defenseless and Moneygetting Cowards  IT must be confessed that Doctor DAVENANT the most able Writer on these Subjects hath affirmed  "That now the whole Art of War is in a Manner reduced to Money and nowadays that Prince who can best find Money to  feed cloath and pay his Army not he that hath the most valiant Troops is surest of Success and Conquest  Ways and Means p v ii p  "  This Declaration which is now stolen and retailed for new by every modern Dabler in Politics has had the usual Fortune of these kind of Thefts to be misunderstood as may appear from the general Tenor of the Doctor's Writings To shew this two Instances out of many may suffice Even when speaking on the Benefits of foreign Trade he warns us as if he had foreseen all that has befallen or is likely to befall us For he says  "If a trading and rich People are grown soft and luxurious their Wealth will invite over to them Invaders from Abroad and their being  effeminate  will make the Conquest easy  Dav on Trade  "  And  again in Terms yet stronger  "In succeeding Times our Manners may come to be depraved and when this happens all Sorts of Miseries will invade us The whole Wealth of the Kingdom will not be sufficient for it's Defence  Ibid p  "  THUS what he and other sensible Writers have affirmed under proper Restrictions and upon Supposition that a Nation maintained it's Manners and Principles is now advanced absolutely and without Restriction as if Manners and Principles military and naval Skill and Courage had no Part or at least no essential Part in the Success of War  THESE shallow Politicians therefore might well be put in Mind of the Maxim of a warlike Prince when his Ministers  dissuaded him from attacking a wealthy Enemy because he wanted Money to pay his Troops  "My Enemies said he are rich luxurious and effeminate my Troops are valiant and hardy my Officers brave and honourable they shall plant  my  Standard in my Enemy's Country and then  my Enemy shall pay them"  WE have lately seen this military Conduct followed by a brave King in the Electorate of  Saxony  We ourselves have formerly pursued it on the Plains of  Agincourt  and  Cressi  The  French  are now pursuing it on the Plains of  America  And if we hold to our dastardly Maxim they will pursue it on the Plains of  Salisbury  THUS the boasted modern Maxim which we proposed to obviate seems void of  Truth in every Branch of it As it appears from this View that without the internal Strength which Manners and Principles produce the most exorbitant Trade and Wealth can never be the Foundation of a successful War or give us any rational Prospect either of  Victory  or  SelfDefence  SECT IX Another Objection considered  SUCH then are the natural Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth unless counteracted by opposite Manners or Principles The History of our own Nation would confirm these Truths in a most striking and particular Manner were it within the proposed Limits of this Estimate to enter so large a Field of Enquiry We should there see that Manners and Principles  have always prevailed and baffled the most sanguine Attempts of Wealth when set in Competition with them This System would be found supported by a vast Variety of Events from the Reign of  Elizabeth  to the present Times But this might perhaps be regarded as a Research rather curious than necessary since a single Reflection on the present State of the Kingdom may seem to stand in the Place of a thousand Proofs  AT present therefore we shall not touch on this Enquiry but rather proceed to remove another Objection which may seem to overturn the Theory here proposed  FOR it is urged that  France  is an Exception to the Truth of these Remarks inasmuch as in the midst of a large and extensive Commerce which brings in a  vast Accession of Wealth she stills retains her Principles and Power  THE Fact objected is true but the Consequence follows not because the Trade of  France  is limited and controuled by such Accidents as prevent it's most dangerous and ruinous Effects on Government  THE  Poverty  of its  Noblesse  or leading Ranks who are often possessed of sounding Titles without any Realities annexed as it prevents them from reaping that Increase of Wealth which naturally ariseth to a rich Landed Gentry from an Increase of Commerce so it naturally drives them to the Profession of  Arms  as the necessary Means of Support This strengthens and supports their Monarchy which finding it's Advantage from this Disposition to  Arms naturally gratifies this military Spirit in it's  Noblesse  and gives it Exercise and Encouragement by frequent Wars  HENCE the national Spirit of the  French Noblesse  hath long been military in the highest Degree  WITH Regard to Commerce it's Growth in  France  hath been but late Meeting therefore with this established Spirit of Arms in the leading Ranks it hath not as yet been able to controul it Commerce indeed is encouraged but so encouraged as not to destroy the leading Principle of their Monarchy To this End the Ranks of the Kingdom are kept essentially distinguished and while the People are allured to Trade by every Kind of Motive the  Noblesse  or Gentry are in Honour prohibited from Commerce It was indeed  formerly proposed in  France  that the  Noblesse  should be drawn down to Trade But whether thro' deep and consummate Policy or thro' the Principle of Honour itself working blindly for it's own Preservation the dangerous Proposal was  weakly  or  wisely  rejected Whenever this Overture meets with Acceptance and Success tho' it may seem for a while to give Vigour to their State yet from that Period we may date the Downfall of  France  Their effeminate Manners now controuled by  Oeconomy  and the Love of  Glory  will like ours degenerate into  Profusion  and the Love of  Gold  ON the contrary Trade tho' encouraged is by the ruling Principle of this great Monarchy kept within it's proper Limits and while the Merchant traverseth Seas in Pursuit of  Gain  the Gentleman does the  same in Pursuit of  Glory  Thus the two incompatible Provinces are kept distinct and hence while the  French  vie with us in  Trade  they tower above us in  Principle  NAY their very trading Settlements among foreign Nations are actuated by this ruling Principle in such a Manner as to give a Splendor to their Monarchy and Commerce in the most barbarous Climates  Numerous Proofs might be given of this At present it may suffice to take one from a very fine Book lately published  "It is usual among the  French  of  Alexandria  to shew an extreme Respect for their Consul In order to make him more considerable in the Eyes of the  Turks  and of the other Nations they endeavour to give an high Idea of his Person and to illustrate his Birth in such a Manner that it is not their Fault if he is not considered as issued from the Blood Royal If by Chance he take a Tour to  Rosetto  he carries a white Flag at the Mast of his Pinnace and when he goes out of the Port as likewise when he returns into it he is saluted by a general Discharge of the Cannon of the  French  Vessels"  NORDEN'S Travels in  Egypt  and  Nubia  Vol i p  Thus while  we  are poorly influenced by a sorry and mercantile Maxim  first broached by a trading Minister  "that the  Interest  of a Nation is it's  truest  Honour"  the  French  conduct themselves on an opposite and higher Principle  "that the  Honour  of a Nation is its truest Interest"  IN Confirmation of what is here advanced we need only cast our Eyes on the Fortune and Fate of  France  during the present Century In the last War she was exhausted tho' victorious in the former she was both beaten and exhausted In both these Instances it was weakly thought by every superficial Politician in  England  that because we had exhausted the Men  and Money we had destroyed the Power of  France  Experience hath told us the Reverse The Spirit of Honour and Union working at the Root soon restored those Branches that War had swept away and have at length shot them into their former Vigour and Luxuriancy  HENCE then we may learn an important Truth  "That no incidental Events can make a Nation  little  while the Principles remain that made it  great"  SECT X The Conclusion  FROM these accumulated Proofs then it seems evident that our present effeminate Manners and Defect of Principle have arisen from our exorbitant Trade and Wealth left without Check to their natural  Operations and uncontrouled Influence And that these Manners and this Defect of Principle by weakening or destroying the national Capacity Spirit of Defence and Union have produced such a general Debility as naturally leads to Destruction  WE might now proceed to confirm these Reasonings by Examples drawn from History For there is hardly an ancient or modern State of any Note recorded in Story which would not in one Respect or other confirm the leading Principles on which this Argument is built  IN these throughout their several Periods we should see  Trade  and  Wealth  or what is in this respect equivalent  Conquest  and  Opulence  taking their Progress At one Period polishing  and strengthening at another refining corrupting weakening destroying the State that gave them Entrance Working indeed in different Ways and under a Variety of Appearances by Avarice by Faction by Effeminacy by Profligacy by a Mixture and Combination of all these Evils sometimes dividing a Nation against itself at others quelling it's Spirit and leaving it an easy Prey to the first Invader Sometimes checked by a rising Patriot or counterworked by national Misfortunes In one Country corrupting Manners in another Principles in a third both Manners and Principles rendering one People blind another cowardly another treacherous to itself Stealing secretly and insensibly on one Nation overwhelming another in sudden Destruction  BUT to enlarge on these Subjects in that vague and undistinguishing Manner which most Writers have pursued in treating them tho' it might carry the  Appearance  of Reasoning would in Truth be no more than  Declamation  in Disguise And to develope and unravel the Particularity of Causes and Effects thro' all their Variety of Combination and mutual Influence as it would extend this Estimate beyond it's designed Limits must be left to make a Part of some future Enquiry  THE  Character Effects  and  Sources  of our Manners and Principles being thus laid open the Writer had it in his Thoughts to have proceeded to the Consideration of  "their most practicable Remedies"  But as the Closet  Projects  of retired and speculative Men often  are  and always are  reguarded  as  chimerical  he was therefore unwilling at present to hazard the Discredit of such an Attempt  HOWEVER lest his Attempt should be deemed more visionary than perhaps it is he judged it not improper to hint at some of the leading Principles on which it is built And with this View the following Reflections are submitted to the Consideration of the Public  THE World has been long amused with a trite and hacknied Comparison between the Life of Man and that of States in which it is pretended that they both proceed in the same irrevocable Manner from Infancy to Maturity from Maturity to Death A Comparison perhaps as groundless as it is common The human Body contains in its very Texture the  Seeds of certain Dissolution That is tho' you set aside all the possible Accidents arising from Intemperance from the Influence of the Elements the Climate and every other external and contingent Cause the human Frame itself after a certain Period would grow into Rigidity the Fluids would decrease the Solids accumulate the Arteries  ossify  the Blood stagnate and the Wheels of Life stand still  BUT in Societies of whatever Kind there seems no such necessary or essential Tendency to Dissolution The human Body is  naturally  mortal the political only so by  Accident  Internal Disorders or Diseases may arise External Violence may attack or overpower but these Causes tho' always to be expected are wholly incidental the first is precisely of the same Nature as Intemperance the second as  the Influence of the external Elements on the human Body But there appears nothing in the internal Construction of any State that tends inevitably to Dissolution analogous to those Causes in the human Frame which lead to certain Death  THIS Observation seems confirmed by History Where you see States which after being sunk in Corruption and Debility have been brought back to the Vigour of their first Principles But you must have recourse to Fables for medicated Old Age restored to Infancy or Youth  IF this be true it seems not altogether chimerical tho' confessedly difficult to bring about the Reformation of a State To lay down general Rules in such a Case would be like giving a  Panacea  the very  Empiricism  of Politics The Remedies must be suited to the Disease  WE have seen that the ruling Evils of our Age and Nation have arisen from the unheeded Consequences of our Trade and Wealth That these have produced effeminate Manners and occasioned Loss of Principle That these have brought on a national Debility But would the lessening this exorbitant Trade and Wealth bring back Manners and Principles and restore the Nation's StrengthI very much Question the Event  BUT whatever the Consequences might be at  Home  those  Abroad  would certainly be fatal The  French  are every Day gaining upon us in Commerce and if ours should lessen theirs would increase to our Destruction  THUS are we fallen into a kind of Dilemma If our Commerce be maintained or increased its Effects bid fair to destroy us If Commerce be discouraged and lessened the growing Power of our Enemy threatens the same Consequence  THERE seems then no other Expedient than this  "That Commerce and Wealth be not discouraged in their  Growth  but checked and  controuled in their Effects"  AND even in attempting this Care must be had lest in controuling the Effects of Commerce we should destroy Commerce itself  WE see how strongly the natural Effects of Trade and Wealth are controuled in  France  by proper Checks and counteracting Principles Yet mere Imitation is always a narrow and often an ineffectual Scheme Besides as our Constitution is of a superior Nature so our Manners and Principles must be adapted to it ere it can obtain it's proper Strength  THE Virtues yet left among us and enumerated above  See Part I Sect  may be a possible Foundation for such a Change  THERE are two different Kinds of Remedies which might in due Time be applied The first are radical general and lasting The latter palliative particular and temporary  THE first seem totally impracticable at  present  For as they suppose a Change of  Manners and Principles this may justly be regarded as an impossible Event during the present Age and rather to be wished than hoped for in the next  THE palliative particular and temporary Remedies may seem more practicable at this Juncture I mean those which are of the coercive Kind which work by opposed Passions or by destroying the Opportunities or Occasions of Evil Where the ruling Mischiefs lie among the People these Remedies with proper Care may easily be administered Thus we have lately seen the salutary Effects of a new Kind of Police established by a useful Magistrate in the City of  London  by which the reigning Evil of  StreetRobberies  hath been almost wholly suppressed altho' we may reasonably suppose the Disposition towards them remains as strong as ever  BUT where the ruling Mischief desolates the Great there even the palliative Remedies cannot easily be applied The Reason is manifest A coercive Power is wanting They who should cure the Evil are the very Delinquents And moral or political Physic is what no distempered Mind will ever administer to itself  NECESSITY therefore and  Necessity alone  must in such a Case be the Parent of Reformation So long as degenerate and unprincipled Manners can support themselves they will be deaf to Reason blind to Consequences and obstinate in the  long  established Pursuit of  Gain  and  Pleasure  In such Minds the Idea of a Public has no Place and therefore can never be a Curb to private Gratification Nor can such Minds be ever awakened from their  fatal Dream till either the Voice of an abused People rouse them into Fear or the State itself totter thro' the general Incapacity Cowardice and Disunion of those who should support it  WHENEVER this compelling Power  Necessity  shall appear then and not till then may
