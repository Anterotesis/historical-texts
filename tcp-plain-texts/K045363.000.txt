Canopy on the front of which is an Escutcheon fixed with the Ottoman Arms crowned with Feathers in the Back scenes the Sultan's Door covered with a Curtain  Enter  OSMYN  and  ELMIRA  OSMYN  TELL me what right have you to be discontented  El  When first I came within these walls I found myself a slave and the thoughts of being shut up for ever here terrified me to death my tears flowed incessantly Solyman was moved with them and solemnly promised to restore me to my liberty my parents and my country  Os  And yet when the Sultan agreed to send you back to Georgia you did not avail yourself of his generosity  El  True but his munisicence and above all the tenderness and love he expressed to me since have reconcil'd  me to this place and I vainly thought my charms could have attach'd him to me  Os  Why then complain You still possess his heart Already you have been twice honour'd with the imperial handkerchief  El  His heart does not this place contain a hundred beauties who equally share his love Tell the Sultan I'm determin'd and ready to accept the first opportunity of returning to my friends and country  Os  I shall procure you an answer this morningBut hark the Sultan approaches    Exit  Elmira    The curtain is drawn and the  Sultan  enters preceded by Mutes  c  A grand March played  Sul  Osmyn  Os  The humblest of your slaves attends    Bows to the ground  Sul  My friend quit this style of servitude I am weary of it  Os  And of the seraglio too Sir  Sul  It even is soand yet upon reflection I cannot tell why unless that having been accustom'd to the noise of camps and the business of war I know not how to relish pleasures which though varied appear insipid thro' the ease and tranquillity with which they are attainedYour voice used to charm me  Osmyn  sings  Behold yonder zephyr how lightly it blows  And copying of lovers it ne'er seeks repose  But flies to the pink to the lily the rose  Caressing each flower of the garden and grove  Then still let your pleasure variety crown  'Mongst the different beauties that rove up and down  Court the charms of the fair of the black of the brown  They're the flowers that embellish the garden of love  Sul  I have often told you I am not touch'd with mere caressing machines who are taught to love or fear by interest  Os  And yet your highness must confess your servant has neglected nothing perfectly to content particularly in one object he procur'd you  Sul  Who is that  Os  The Circaffian beautythe Sultana Elmira  Sul  And truly she possesses all the charms that can adorn her Sex  Os  You thought so once  Sul  Once I think so still  Os  Indeed  Sul  Positivelywhy should you doubt it  Os  Your word is my law But Sir there is matter I must acquaint you with I cannot manage the seraglio and by the beard of Heli I would rather quit the helm I can no longer guide That English slave lately brought here is quite ungovernable she is sure to do every thing she is forbid she makes a joke of our threats and answers our most serious admonitions with a laugh besides she is at variance with the rest of the women and shows them such an example that I cannot longer rule them  Sul  That is your businessI will have them all agreeHow do you call her  Os  Since she has been here we have called her  Roxalana  Sul  WellYou must endeavour to bring her to reason  Os  Shall the Sultana Elmira throw herself at your highness's feet then  Sul  Let her comeAnd do you hear Osmyn go to the apartment of that Persian slave you spoke of yesterday she that sings so well and send her hither  Os  I will most sublime Sultan    Exit  Osmyn  Enter  Elmira  She kneels  Sul  I know beforehand that you come to upbraid meWe have not met so often lately as our mutual inclinations wou'd have made agreeable but don't attribute that to coldness which has been the unavoidable consequence of affairsthe business of the Divan has taken up so much of my time  El  I don't presume to complain for your image is so imprinted on my heart that you are always present to my mind  Sul    impatiently    Nay dear Elmira I have not the least doubt  El  How does my sovereign like this robe which I have put on on purpose to please him  Sul  Oh    yawning    Elmira you love musicI have sent for the Persian slave who I am told sings so wellif she answers the description she will afford you entertainment  El  I want none when you are present your company suffices for every thing  Sul  Yonder comes our singer  Enter  Ismena  Is    kneeling    Your slave attends your pleasure    The  Sultan  makes a sign to the Eunuchs who bring two stools and beckon  Elmira  to sit  El  This is an honour I did not expect    Taking her seat  Ismena  sings  Blest hero who in peace and war  Triumph alike and raise our wonder  In peace the shafts of love you bear  In war the bolts of Jove's own thunder    While  Ismena  sings  Solyman  takes  Elmira's  hand  Sul  Beautiful Ismena methought that song did not so well express the effects of loveMadam    to  Elmira  we will hear her againI never heard any thing so charmingher voice is exquisiteWhat do you think of her  El  If she hears all this 'twill make her vainI cannot bear all thisI am ready to burst with indignation and anger    Exit  Elmira  Sul  There is something in this slave that interests me in her favour she shall be received among the Sultana's attendants and by that means we shall have an opportunity of hearing her often    Turning perceives  Elmira  gone    But where's the Sultana I did not perceive she had lest usFollow her Ismena and endeavour to amuse her    Exit  Ismena  Enter  Osmyn  Os  I come to tell your Highness there is no bearing that English slave she says such things and does such things that  Sul  Why what is't she does  Os  She mimics menay and mimics you too  Sul  Pho pho  Os  Advice is lost upon herWhen I attempt to give it she falls a singing and dancingThere is no enduring it if you do not permit me to correct her  Sul  You take these things in too serious a lightShe seems indeed a singular character  Os  She has the impudence of the devil but just now I threatened to complain to you of her she said she would complain of me and here she comes  Enter  Roxalana  Sul  How now  Rox  Well heaven be prais'd at least here is something like a human figure You are Sir I suppose the sublime Sultan whose slave I have the honour to be if so pray oblige me so far as to drive from your presence that horrid ugly creature there for he shocks my sight    To  Osmyn  Do you hear Go  Sul    gravely    They complain Roxalana of your irreverent behaviour you must learn to treat the officers of our Seraglio whom we have set over you with more deferenceAll in this place honour their superiors and obey in silence  Rex  In silenceand obey is this a sample of your Turkish gallantryYou must be vastly lov'd indeed if you address women in that strain  Sul  Consider you are not now in your own country  Rox  No indeed you make me feel the difference severelyThere reigns ease content and liberty every citizen is himself a king where the king is himself a citizen  Sul  Have a humour more gentle and pliable I advise you to alter your behaviour for very good reasons and it is for your good there are very rigorous laws in the Seraglio for such as are refractory  Rox  Upon my word you have made a very delicate speech and I admire the gravity with which it was uttered  Sul  Roxalana I am serious  Os  What does your Highness think now Did I tell you the truth  Rox  Oh whisperingWhat is it that monster saysthat whatdoyoucallhim that goodfornothing amphibious animal who follows us like sheep here and is for ever watching us with his frightful glaring eyes as if he would devour usIs this the confidante of your pleasuresthe guardian of our chastityI must do him the justice to confess that if you give him money for making himself hated he certainly does not steal his wages We can't step one step but he is after us by and by I suppose he will weigh out air and measure light to us he won't let us walk in the gardens lest it should rain men upon us and if it did 'tis a blessing we've been long wishing for  Os  There now don't she go on at a fine rate  Rox  Don't mind that ugly creature but listen to meIf you follow my counsel I shall make you an accomplish'd princeI wish to make you belov'dLet your windowbars be taken downlet the doors of the Seraglio be thrown openlet inclination alone keep your women within it and instead of that ugly odious creature there send a handsome smart young officer to us every morning one that will treat us like ladies and lay out the pleasure of the day    While she is speaking  Solyman  admires her  Sul    to  Osmyn  Did you ever see so expressive a countenance    To  Rox  Have you any more to say  Rox  Yes Sir thisTo desire you will not mind him but attend to meMen were not born to advisethe thing is expressly the contraryWe women have certainly ten thousand times more senseMen indeedMen were born for no other purpose under heaven but to amuse us and he who succeeds best perfectly answers the end of his creationNow Sir farewell If I find you profit by my first lesson I may perhaps be tempted to give you another    Exit  Os  Did you ever hear the like SirHer insolence is not to be borne  Sul  I think it amusing  Os  I shall certainly lose all my authority in the Seraglio if she is not corrected  Sul  'Tis a girla sool of a disposition that chastisement would make worseGo after her Osmyn bid her come back and drink therbet with me  Os  Sherbet with you Sir  Sul  I have said it    Goes on the throne takes a pipe    Well for my life I can't get the better of my astonishment at hearing a slave talk in so extraordinary a manner    Smokes    And the more I think of it my astonishment is the greaterShe's not handsome that is what is call'd a beauty yet her little nose cock'd in the air her laughing eyes and the play of her features have an effect all togetherElmira has something more soft and more majesticyet methinks I have a mind to sift Roxalana's character mere curiosity and nothing elseIt is the first time we have seen in this place a spirit of caprice and independenceI'll try at least what she'll say to me fartherThere can be no harm to divert myself with her extravagance  Reenter  Osmyn  Os  I have delivered your message  Sul  Deliver'd my message Where's Roxalana  Os  In her chamber where she has lock'd herself in  Sul  No matter for her being in her chamberWhat did she say  Os  Treasure of Light said Ithrough the keyholeI come from the Sublime Sultan to kiss the dust beneath your feet and desire you will come and drink sherbet with him She answer'd through the keyhole Go tell your master I have no dust on my feet and I don't like sherbet  Sul  In effect Osmyn the fault is yoursyou took your time ill as you commonly doYou should have waited some timedon't you owe her respect  Os  And after this wou'd you have her come again  Sul  Perhaps I would  Os  Shall I fetch the Sultana Elmira too  Sul  What's the meaning of this Osmyn I tell you once more go and bring me Roxalana    Curtain moves  Os  Who is it that meddles with the great curtain  Sul  Who is it lifts that portal there  Rox    coming from behind    'Tis I  Sul  You and how dare you take that liberty  Os  Ay how dare youDon't you know 'tis death for any to enter there but the Sultan without being conducted  Sul  Come come she's not acquainted with the customs of the Seraglio so let it pass Roxalana I beg your pardonI am afraid he has disturb'd you now  Rox  Oh it is only what I expectedYou Turks are not reckoned very politeIn my country a gallant waits upon a lady but the custom is quite different here I find  Sultan  offers her the pipe she strikes it down  What do you think I smoke  Sul  How's thisDoes your insolence go so far  Os  What do you command Sir  Sul  Silence  Rox  What angry before a womanI'm quite asham'd of you  Sul  This is not to be suffer'dand yet there's something so foolish in it tooCome hither Roxalana I want to speak to you  Rox  No I thank you I am very well where I am  Sul  Tell me then is it in this light manner women behave in England  Rox  Pretty near it  Sul  And suppose I wou'd for once forget your national vivacity would it make you more cautious for the futureCome give me your hand and you may imagine I have forgot all you have said to me  Rox  So much the worse for you I told you a great many good thingsI see my frankness is disagreeable but you must grow us'd to it Don't you think yourself very happy to find a friend in a slave one that will teach you how to love too for 'tis in my country love is in its element It is there all life and tenderness because it is free and yet even there a husband belov'd is next to a prodigyIf it be then so difficult to love a husband what must it be to love a master I am your friend I tell you truthand do you know why you dislike to hear itbecause it is a language your ears are unaccustom'd toBut I don't mind that I shall make you well acquainted with itHappy would it be for every prince had they a friend near them to tell them the truth  Sul  But you must treat me with respect  Rox  I treat you with respectthat would be worse still  Sul  Indeed  Rox  Oh your notions are horridI shall correct you  Sul  Correct meIn what pray  Rox  In what concerns you  Sul  She is the strangest mortal sureBut let's have no more of this  Rox  Nay though you don't take my lessons as patiently as I could wish I hope you are not displeas'd with meI should be sorry to offend you  Sul  You may easily avoid it then  Rox  It will be nothing in time  Sul  Why won't you consider who I am and who you are  Rox  Who I am and who you are Yes Sir I do consider very well that you are the Grand Sultan I am your slave but I am also a freeborn woman prouder of that than all the pomp and splendour eastern monarchs can bestow  Sul  As far as I can perceive then you would be very glad to get away from me  Rox  You never were more right in your life  Sul  Well but if I endeavour to render the Seraglio agreeable to youif I study to make you happy might you not in your turn try to deserve my favour  Rox  No  Sul  Do you speak that sincerely  Rox  As I think it  Sul  And yet there is something that whispers me  Rox  Don't believe itI tell you it deceives you  Sul  And must I never expect  Rox  Nevercaprice and fancy decide all  Rox  In caprice and fancy then I rest my hopes and in the mean time you shall sup with me  Rox  NoI beg to be excus'dI'd rather not  Sul  Why so'tis an honour that you ought  Rox  An honour that I oughtSir you ought to lay aside those humiliating phrases for while they teach us your superior greatness they rob you of the pleasure of being agreeableBut to be in good humour Sir I ought not to accept your proposals for I know that suppers here tend to certainthings that I can'tindeed Sir  Sul  Well as you please  Rox  That is very well said you are my pupil you know and should give up every point to me and since that is the case instead of my supping with you you shall dine with me  Sul  With all my heartbe it soOsmyn  Enter  Osmyn  Sul  Osmyn  Rox  Osmyn I say hear my directionsYou know I am to speakGo to the clerk of the kitchen and desire him to provide a handsome entertainment in my apartment as the Sultan dines with me  Os  Did you Highness order  Sul  What do you stand for Do as she bids you    Exit  Osmyn  bowing  Rox  Are there not some females here that would enliven the conversation for example the beautiful Sultana Elmira that accomplish'd favourite you love so well her company must be agreeable and the Persian slave Ismena who I am told sings enchantinglyand whom you love a little  Sul  Yesbut  Rox  I understand youyou will have her too  Sul  It is not necessarywe'll be alone  Rox  Alonea  têteatête  would be a great pleasure to be sureoh no  Sul  I promise you I expect it  Enter  Osmyn  Os  Madam your orders are obey'd  Sul  Go to Elmira's apartment and tell her I shall see her this evening This evening do you hear  Rox  I don't like that whispering thereWhat's that you sayyou know I have often told you of that ugly trick  Sul  NothingI'll come to hergo  Rox  Stay I say I have some business with you  Sul  StayCertainly there never was any thing half  o pleasant as this creature    Exit  Rox  Go Osmyn to the apartments of the Sultana Elmira and to the chamber of the slave Ismena and tell  them to come and dine with the SultanIf you neglect obeying my orders your head shall answer for itAnd do you hear don't let them know you came from me with this invitationTake care of your head

Elmira  and  Osmyn  El  It is impossibleA pretty thing truly she is to dispute the Sultan's heart with me  Os  I tell you her ascendency over him is such that  requires the greatest art and caution to counteract it  Well Osmyn be my friend and here take this  Osmyn and be sure speak ill of all my rivals  all the good you possibly can of me  Roxalana  appears    Os  Death and hell we are deceived    Aside and  exit  Rox  Take this locket Osmyn and be sure you speak ill of all my rivals Ha ha ha  El  Insipid pleasantry Know this however Madam I was the first possessor of the Sultan's heart and as such will maintain my rights and employ my power to keep it  Rox  By a locketHolloa who waits there  Enter  Osmyn  Go tell the Grand Signior to come here  Os  I will MadamI'll be your friend you may depend on me  Rox  Go    Exit  Osmyn  Elmira I don't intend to dispute the Sultan's heart with you and to prove it you must know that it was I invited you to dine with him here therefore make the best

her envy and rendering her punishment complete leave her in everlasting jealousy  El  I beseech you think no more of her  Sul  Pardon me I think differentlyLet her be brought hither I say  Os  Sir they have not had time to put on her slave's habit yet  Sul  No matterfetch her as she is and now Elmira let our endearments be redoubled in her sight  El  Is that necessary Sir  Sul  Oh it will gall herI know it will gall herWe feel our misfortunes with tenfold anguish when we compare what we are with what we might have been  El  It will have no effect she is a giddy creatureher gaiety is her all  Sul  No no the contrary that's the thing that strikes me in Roxalana's character Through what you call her frivolous gaiety candour and good sense shine so apparent  El  There's an end on'tif you justify her    Proudly  Sul  I justify her far from it and you shall presently be convinc'd I mean to make her feel the utmost rigour of my resentment  Enter  Roxalana  Here she comesshe's in affliction and her lefthand there endeavours to hide a humiliated countenance    To Roxalana    ApproachElmira have you determin'd how you will dispose of her  El  I shall not add to what she suffers  Sul  How that sentiment charms me Indeed Elmira I blush to think that so unworthy an object shou'd have been able for a moment to surprise me to a degree even to make me forget your superior merit but I am now yours for ever and ever  Rox  Ha ha ha  Sul  Death and hell she laughs  Rox  Ha ha ha 'Tis involuntary I assure you therefore pray forgive me I beg your pardon  Sul  'Tis impudence beyond bearing but I want to know the meaning of all this  Rox  The meaning is plain and anybody may see with half an eye you don't love Elmira  Sul  Whom do I love then  Rox  Me  Sul  You are the object of my anger  Rox  That don't signify love and anger often go together I am the object of your anger because I treat you with the sincerity of a friend but with your Highness's permission I shall take myself away this moment for ever  Sul  Go then and prefer infamy to grandeur  Rox  I will instantly get out of your sublime presence    Going  Sul  No you shan't goElmira do you withdraw    Exit  Elmira  Were I to give way to my transports I should make you feel the weight of my displeasure but I frame excuses for you that you scorn to make for yourselfWhat despise my favours insult my condescensionSure you can't be sensible of your own follyProceed go on continue to enrage your too indulgent master  Rox  You are my master it is true but could the robber that sold me to you for a thousand chequins transfer my mind and inclinations to you along with my personNo Sir let it never be said that the great Solyman meanly triumphed over the person of the slave whose mind he could not subdue  Sul  Tell me who you are what species of inconsistent being at once so trifling and respectable that you seduce my heart while you teach me my duty  Rox  I am nothing but a poor slave who is your friend  Sul  Be still my friend my mistress for hitherto I have known only flatterers I here devote myself to you and the whole empire shall pay you homage  Rox  But pray tell me then by what title am I to govern here  Sul  By what title I don't understand youCome come no more of this affected coyness and dissembling I see I know you love me  Rox  As Solyman I do but not as emperor of the Turksnor will I ever consent to ascend his bed at night at whose feet I must fall in the morning  Sul  If it depended upon nie Roxalana I swear by our holy prophet that I should be happy in calling you my queen  Rox  That's a poor excuseHad the man I lov'd but a cottage I would gladly partake it with him would sooth his vexations and soften his cares but were he master of a throne I should expect to share it with him or he has no love for me  Sul  Or if you will wait perhaps time will bring it about  Rox  Wait indeed No SirYour wife or humble servantMy resolution is fix'dfix yours  Sul  But an emperor of the Turks  Rox  May do as he pleases and should be despotic sometimes on the side of reason and virtue  Sul  Then there is our law  Rox  Which is monstrous and absurd  Sul  The mufti the vizirs and the agas  Rox  Are your slavesSet them a good example  Sul  Besides what would the people say  Rox  The peopleare they to govern you Make the people happy and they will not prevent your being so They would be pleased to see you raise to the throne one that you love and would love you and be beloved by your people Should she interpose in behalf of the unfortunate relieve the distressed by her munificence and diffuse happiness through the palace she would be admir'dshe would be ador'dshe'd be like the queen of the country from where I came  Sul  It is enoughmy scruples are at an endmy prejudices like clouds before the rising sun vanish before the lights of your superior reasonMy love is no longer a soibleyou are worthy of empire  Enter  Osmyn  Os  Most Sublime Sultanthe Sultana Elmira claims your promise for liberty to depart  Rox  Is that the caseLet then the first instance of my exaltation be to give her libertylet the gates of the Seraglio be thrown open  Sul  And as for Elmira she shall go in a manner suitable to her rank    Exit  Osmyn  Osmyn  returns  Os  Sir the dwarfs and botanges your Highness had ordered attend  Sul  Let them come inThis day is devoted to festivity and you who announce my decree proclaim to the world that the Sultana Roxalana reigns the unrival'd partner of our diadem  Os  There's an end of my officeWho would have thought that a little cock'dup nose would have overturn'd the customs of a mighty empire  Sul  Now my Roxalana let the world observe by thy exaltation the wonderful dispensation of Providence which evinces that  The liberal mind by no distinction bound  Thro' Nature's glass looks all the world around  Would all that's beautiful together join  And find perfection in a mind like thine  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON after performing  Roxalana  at the TheatreRoyal CrowStreet Dublin  LORD how I tremble every atom shaking  What speak an Epilogue of my own making  A task for mepresumptuous and absurd  But I have promis'd and must keep my word  Yes I did promise with a solemn face  Tadaress my patrons here and sue for grace  For your past favours had so warm'd my heart  I thought to tell them needed little art  How vain the thought for pondering day and night  I found though I might speak I cou'd not write  Distress'd to Garrick then I fly for aid  You can assist me Sir for wit's your trade  When of your epilogues I speak a line  Each sidebox cries Oh charming vastly fine  Its quite delightful monstrously divine  The pit alive to every comic stroke  With laughter loud anticipates the joke  All but the modern fop to feeling dead  With heart of adamant and brains of lead  Languid and lifeless lolling yawns takes snuff  And cries As gad's my judge 'tis flimsy stuff  Heaven knows I monstrously abhor a play  It's a  vile bore  what dragg'd me here today  Dear lady Mary how can you attend  Will Garrick's nonsense never have an end  Not so  Sir  Mac who just has cross'd the Tweed  Cries Vary weel ridiculous indeed  The cheeld has parts ah he'd been muckle keen  If bred at Glasgow or at Aberdeen  Sir Paddy lays "My jewel that's mighty pretty  "Faith Garrick you were once in Dublin city  "In sweet Smockalley you have cut a figure  "Oh you'd be great were you a little bigger"  Thus na ions parties all in this agree  And humour's palm oh Garrick yield to thee  Then good Sir scribble something new for me  To Garrick thus in flattering strains I sue  But all in vain nor prayers nor flattery do  Since thus  obdurate  all their aid refuse  I a mere novice must invoke the Muse  Oh would immortal Shakespear's  muse  of  fire  Heave in my breast each  kindling  thought inspire  Or cou'd I mount on the Moeonian wing  Or chant such songs as  raptur'd  Seraphs sing  To you my kind protectors wou'd I raise  My fullest loudest warmest notes of praise  The great the brave the fair who now appear  In bright array to grace this circle here  My Muse to late stages should proclaim  Their worth record and consecrate their fame  While gratitude on  rapturous  pinions soars  And echoes loud the virtues she adores
