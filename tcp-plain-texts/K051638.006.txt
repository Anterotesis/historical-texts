 CLARISSA  OR THE HISTORY OF A YOUNG LADY Comprehending  The most  Important Concerns  of  Private LIFE And particularly shewing The DISTRESSES that may attend the Misconduct Both of PARENTS and CHILDREN In Relation to MARRIAGE  Published by the  EDITOR  of  PAMELA  VOL VI  LONDON  Printed for S Richardson And Sold by JOHN OSBORN in  Paternoster Row  By ANDREW MILLAR overagainst  Catharinestreet  in the  Strand  By J and J RIVINGTON in  St Paul's Churchyard  And by J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCXLVIII  THE HISTORY OF Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE VOL VI  LETTER I  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Friday June    I  AM ruined undone blownup destroyed and worse than annihilated that's certain But was not the news shocking enough dost thou think without thy throwing into the too weighty scale reproaches which thou couldest have had no opportunity to make but for my own voluntary communications At a time too when as it falls out I have another very sensible disappointment to struggle with  I imagine if there be such a thing as future pu∣nishment it must be none of the smallest mortifica∣tions that a  new  devil shall be punished by a worse  old one  And  Take that  And  Take that  to have the old satyr cry to the screaming sufferer lay∣ing on with a cato'ninetails with a star of burn∣ing  brass at the end of each And  For what For what  Why if the truth might be fairly told for not being so bad a devil as myself  Thou art surely casuist good enough to know what I have insisted upon  Vol  iii  p    heretofore that the sin of seducing a credulous and easy girl is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one  However ungenerous an appearance what I am going to say may have from  my  pen let me tell thee That if such a lady as Miss Harlowe chose to enter into the matrimonial state  I am resolved to disap∣point thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and despair  and according to the old patriarchal system to go on contributing to get sons and daughters with no other view than to bring them up piously and to be good and useful members of the commonwealth what a devil had she to do to let her fancy run a gadding after a Rake One whom she  knew  to be a Rake  O but truly she hoped to have the merit of re∣claiming him She had formed pretty notions how charmingly it would look to have a penitent of her own making dangling at her side to church thro' an applauding neighbourhood And as their family in∣creased marching with her thither at the head of their boys and girls processionally as it were boasting of the fruits of their  honest desires  as my good Lord Bishop has it in his Licence And then what a comely fight all kneeling down together in one pew according to eldership as we have seen in effigie a whole family upon some old monument where the honest chevalier in armour is presented kneeling with uplift hands and half a dozen jolterheaded cropeared boys behind him ranged  gradatim  or stepfashion according to age and size all in the same postureFacing his pious dame with a ruff about her neck and as many wheyfaced girls all  kneeling behind  her  An altar between them and an opened book upon it Over their heads semilu∣nary rays darting from gilded clouds surrounding an atchievementmotto IN COELO SALUS or QUIESperhaps if they have happened to live the usual married life of brawl and contradiction  It is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with Miss Clarissa Harlowe were I to have valued my reputation or ease as it is that of Miss Harlowe to have been acquainted with me And after all what have I done more than prosecute the ma∣xims by which thou and I and every Rake are go∣verned and which before I knew this lady we have pursued from pretty girl to pretty girl as fast as we had set one down taking another upjust as the fellows do with their flyingcoaches and flyinghorses at a countryfairWith a  Who rides next Who rides next  But here in the present case to carry on the volant metaphor for I must either be merry or mad is a pretty little Miss just come out of her hangingsleeve coat brought to buy a pretty little fairing for the world Jack is but a great fair thou knowest and to give thee serious reflection for serious all its toys but tinselled hobbyhorses gilt gingerbread squeaking trumpets painted drums and so forth  Now behold this pretty little Miss skimming from booth to booth in a very pretty manner One pretty little fellow called Wyerly perhaps another jiggeting rascal called Biron a third simpering var∣let of the name of Symmes and a more hideous villain than any of the rest with a long bag under his arm and parchment settlements tagg'd to his heels y  leped Solmes pursue her from rareeshow to rareeshow shouldering upon one another at every turning stopping when she stops and set a spinning again when she movesAnd thus dangled after but  still in the eye of her watchful guardians traverses the pretty little Miss thro' the whole fair equally delighted and delighting Till at last taken with the invitation of the  lac'dhat orator  and seeing several pretty little bibwearers stuck together in the flyingcoaches cutting safely the yielding air in the Onegoup the Othergodown picture oftheworld ve∣hicle and all with as little fear as wit is tempted to ride next  In then suppose she slily pops when  none of her friends are near her  And if after two or three ups and downs her pretty head turns giddy and she throws herself out of the coach when at its eleva∣tion and so dashes out her pretty little brains who can help itAnd would you hang the poor fellow whose  professed trade  it was to set the pretty little creatures a flying  'Tis true this pretty little Miss being a  very  pretty little Miss being a  very muchadmired  little Miss being a very  good  little Miss who always minded her book and had passed thro' her samplardoctrine with high applause had even stitched out in gaudy propriety of colours an Abraham offering up Isaac a Samson and the Philistines and flowers and knots and trees and the sun and the moon and the seven stars all hung up in frames with glasses before them for the admiration of her future grand∣children Who likewise was intitled to a very pretty little estate Who was descended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility which lived in a very pretty little manner respected a very little on their own accounts a great deal on hers  For such a pretty little Miss as this to come to so very great a misfortune must be a very sad thing But tell me would not the losing of any ordinary child of any other less considerable family of less shining or amiable qualities have been as great and as  heavy a loss to that family as the losing this pretty little Miss to hers  To descend to a very low instance and that only as to  personality  hast thou any doubt that thy strongmuscled bony face was as much admired by thy mother as if it had been the face of a Lovelace or any other handsome fellow and had thy picture been drawn would she have forgiven the painter had he not expressed so exactly thy lineaments as that every one should have discerned the likeness The  handsome  likeness is all that is wished for Ugli∣ness made familiar to us with the partiality natural to fond parents will be beauty all the world over Do thou apply  BUT alas Jack all this is but a copy of my countenance drawn to evade thy maliceTho'  t answer thy unfriendly purpose to own it I cannot forbear to own it that I am stung to the very soul with this unhappy  Accident  must I call itHave I nobody whose throat either for carelessness or treachery I ought to cut in order to pacify my vengeance  When I reflect upon my  last  iniquitous intention the  first  outrage so nobly resented as well as so far as she was able so nobly  resisted  I cannot but con∣clude that I was under the power of fascination from these accursed Circes who pretending to know their own sex would have it that there is in every woman a yielding or a weakresisting moment to be met with And that  yet  and  yet  and  yet  I had not tried enoughBut that if neither love nor terror should enable me to hit that lucky moment when by help of their cursed arts she was  once overcome  she would be for  ever overcome  Appealing to all my experience to all my knowlege of the sex for a justification of their assertion  My appealed to experience I own was but too  favourable to their argument For dost thou think I could have held my purpose against such an angel as this had I ever before met with one so much in earnest to defend her honour against the unwearied artifices and perseverance of the man she loved Why then were there not more examples of a virtue so immoveable Or why was this singular one to fall to my lot Except indeed to  double my guilt  and at the same time to convince all that should hear of her story  that there are angels as well as devils in the flesh  So much for confession and for the sake of hu∣mouring my conscience with a view likewise to disarm thy malice by acknowlegement Since no one shall say worse of me than I will of myself on this occasion  One thing I will nevertheless add to shew the sincerity of my contrition'Tis this that if thou canst by any means find her out within these three days or any time before she has discovered the stories relating to Captain Tomlinson and her Uncle to be what they are and if thou canst prevail upon her to consent I will actually in thy presence and his he to represent her uncle marry her  I am still in hopes it may be soShe cannot be long concealedI have already set all engines at work to find her out and if I do what  indifferent  persons and no one of her  friends  as thou observest will look upon her will care to imbroil themselves with a man of my figure fortune and resolutionShew her this part then or any other part of this letter at thy own discretion if thou  canst  find her For after all methinks I would be glad that this affair which is bad enough in itself should go off without worse personal consequences to anybody else and yet it runs in my mind I know not why that sooner or later it will draw a few drops of blood after it except she and I can make it up between  ourselves And this may be another reason why she should not carry her resentment too far Not that such an affair would give me much concern neither were I to choose my man or men for I heartily hate all her family but herself and ever shall  LET me add that the lady's plot to escape ap∣pears to me no extraordinary one There was much more luck than probability that it should do Since to make it succeed it was necessary that Dorcas and Will and Sinclair and her nymphs should be all deceived or off their guard It belongs to me when I see them to give them my hearty thanks that they were and that their selfish care to provide for their own future security should induce them to leave their outward door upon their boltlatch and be curs'd to them  Mabell deserves a pitchsuit and a bonfire rather than the lustring and as her cloaths are returned let the lady's be put to her others to be sent to her when it can be told whitherBut not till I give the word neither for we must get the dear fugitive back again if possible  I suppose that my stupid villain who knew not such a goddessshaped lady with a mien so noble from the aukward and bentshouldered Mabell has been at Hamstead to see after her And yet I hardly think she would go thither He ought to go thro' every street where bills for lodgings are up to in∣quire after a newcomer The houses of such as deal in womens matters and tea coffee and suchlike are those to be inquired at for her If some tidings be not quickly heard of her I would not have either Dorcas Will or Mabell appear in my sight whatever their superiors think fit to do  This tho' written in character is a very long letter considering it is not a narrative one or a journal of proceedings like some of my former  for such will unavoidably and naturally as I may say run into length But I have so used myself to write a great deal of late that I know not how to help it Yet I must add to its length in order to explain myself on a hint I gave at the beginning of it which was that I have another disappointment besides this of Miss Harlowe's escape to bemoan  And what dost think it is Why the old peer  pox  of his tough constitution for that would have helped him on has made shift by fire and brim∣stone and the devil knows what to force the gout to quit the counterscarp of his stomach just as it had collected all its strength in order to storm the citadel of his heart In short they have by the mere force of stinkpots handgranades and popguns drove the slowworking pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities and there it lies nibbling and gnawing upon his great toe when I had hoped a fair end both of the distemper and the distem∣pered  But I who could write to  thee  of laudanum and the wet cloth formerly yet let  l  a year slip thro' my fingers when I had entered upon it more than in imagination for I had begun to ask the stewards questions and to hear them talk of fines and renewals and such sort of stuff  deserve  to be mortified  Thou canst not imagine how differently the ser∣vants and even my cousins look upon me since yesterday to what they did before Neither the one nor the other bow and courtesy half so lowNor am I a quarter so often  his honour  and  your honour  as I was within these few hours with the former And as to the latter It is  cousin Bobby  again with the usual familiarity instead of  Sir  and  Sir  and  If you please Mr Lovelace  And now they have the insolence to congratulate me on the recovery of the  best of uncles  while I am forced to seem as much  delighted as they when would it do me good I could sit down and cry my eyes out  I had bespoken my mourning in imagination after the example of a certain foreign minister who be∣fore the death or even last illness of Charles II as honest White Kennet tells us had half exhausted Blackwellhall of its fables An indication as the historian would insinuate that the monarch was to be poisoned and the ambassador in the secretAnd yet fool that I was I could not take the hint What a devil does a man read history for if he cannot profit by the examples he finds in it  But thus Jack is an observation of the old peer's verified  That one misfortune seldom comes alone  And so concludes  Thy doublymortified  LOVELACE  LETTER II  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Wednesday Night June    O my dearest Miss  HOWE  ONCE more have I escapedBut alas  I  my  best felf  have not escapedOh your poor Clarissa Harlowe  You  also will hate me I fear Yet you won't when you know All  But no more of my self My  lost  self You that can rise in a morning to be blest and to bless and go to rest delighted with your own reflections and in your unbroken unstarting slumbers conversing with saints and angels the former only more pure than yourself as they have shaken off the incumbrance of body YOU shall be my subject as you have long long been my only pleasure And let me at awful distance revere my beloved Anna Howe and in  her  reflect upon what her Clarissa Harlowe once was  FORGIVE Oh forgive my rambling My peace is destroyed My intellects are touched And what flighty nonsense must you read if now you will vouchsafe to correspond with me as formerly  Oh my best my dearest my  only  friend What a tale have I to unfoldBut still upon  Self  this vile this hated  Self  I will shake it off if possible and why should I not since I think except one wretch I hate nothing so muchSelf then be banished from  Self  one moment for I doubt it  will  for no longer to inquire after a  dearer  object my beloved Anna HoweWhose mind all robed in spotless white charms and irradiates But what would I say  AND how my dearest friend after this rhapsody which on reperusal I would not let go but to shew you what a distracted mind dictates to my trembling pen  How do you  You have been very ill it seems That you are  recovered  my dear let me hearThat your mamma is well pray let me hear and hear quicklyThis comfort surely is owing to me for if life is no  worse  than chequerwork I must now have a little white to come having seen nothing but black all unchequered dismal black for a great great while  AND what is all this wild incoherence forIt is only to beg to know how you have been and how you now do by a line directed for Mrs Rachel Clark at Mr Smith's a gloveshop in Kingstreet Coventgarden which altho' my abode is a secret to every body else will reach the hands of  Your unhappy  but that's not enough  Your miserable  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER III  Mrs  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed as directed in the preceding  Friday June    Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  YOU will wonder to receive a letter from me I am sorry for the great distress you seem to be in Such a hopeful young lady as you wereBut see what comes of disobedience to parents  For my part altho' I pity you yet I much more pity your poor father and mother Such education as they gave you such improvements as you made and such delight as they took in youAnd all come to this  But pray Miss don't make my Nancy guilty of your fault which is that of disobedience I have charged her over and over not to correspond with one who has made such a giddy step It is not to her reputation I am sure You  knew  that I so charged her yet you go on corresponding together to my very great vexation for she has been very perverse upon it more than once  Evil communication  Miss You know the rest  Here people cannot be unhappy by themselves but they must involve their friends and acquaintance whose discretion has kept them clear of their errors into near as much unhappiness as if they had run into the like of their own heads Thus my poor daughter is always in tears and grief And she has postponed her own felicity truly because  you  are unhappy  If people who seek their own ruin could be the only sufferers by their headstrong doings it were something But O Miss Miss what have  you  to answer for who have made as many grieved hearts as have known you The whole sex is indeed wounded  by you For who but Miss Clarissa Harlowe was proposed by every father and mother for a pattern for their daughters  I write a long letter where I proposed to say but a few words and those to forbid you writing to my Nancy And this as well because of the false step you have made as because it will grieve her poor heart and do you no good If you love her therefore write not to her Your sad letter came into my hands Nancy being abroad and I shall not shew it her For there would be no comfort for her if she saw it nor for me whose delight she isAs you once was to your parents  But you seem to be sensible enough of your errors now So are all giddy girls when it is too late And what a crestfallen figure then does their selfwilled obstinacy and headstrongness compel them to make  I may say too much only as I think it proper to bear that testimony against your rashness which it behoves every careful parent to bear And none more than▪  Your compassionating well wisher  ANNABELLA HOWE  I send this by a special messenger who has business only so far as Barnet because you shall have no need to write again knowing how you love writing And knowing likewise  that misfortune makes people plaintive  LETTER IV  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  HOWE  Saturday July    PERMIT me Madam to trouble you with a few lines were it only to thank you for your reproofs which have nevertheless drawn fresh streams of blood from a bleeding heart  My story is a dismal story It has circumstances in it that would engage pity and possibly a judg∣ment not altogether unfavourable where those cir∣cumstances known But it is my business and shall be  all  my business to repent of my failings and not endeavour to extenuate them  But I will not seek to distress your worthy mind If  I cannot suffer alone  I will make as few parties as I can in my sufferings And indeed I took up my pen with this resolution when I wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands It was only to know and that for a very particular reason as well as for affection unbounded if my dear Miss Howe from whom I had not heard of a long time were ill as I had been told she was and if so how she now does But my injuries being recent and my distresses having been exceeding great  Self  would croud into my letter When distressed the human mind is apt to turn itself to every one in whom it imagined or wished an interest for pity and conso∣lationOr to express myself better and more con∣cisely in your own words  Misfortune makes people plaintive  And to whom if not to a friend can the afflicted complain  Miss Howe being abroad when my letter came I flatter myself that she is recovered But it would be some satisfaction to me to be informed if she  has been ill  Another line from  your  hand would be too great a favour But if you will be pleased to direct any servant to answer  yes  or  no  to that question I will not be farther troublesome  Nevertheless I must declare that my Miss Howe's friendship was all the comfort I had or expected to have in this world and a line from her would have been a cordial to my fainting heart Judge then dearest Madam how reluctantly I must obey your prohibitionBut yet I will endeavour to obey it altho' I should have hoped as well from the tenor  of all that has passed between Miss Howe and me as from  her  established virtue that she could not be tainted by  Evil communication  had one or two letters been permitted This however I ask not for since I think I have nothing to do but to beg of God who I hope has not yet withdrawn his grace from me altho' he is pleased to let loose his justice upon my faults to give me a truly broken spirit if it be not already broken enough and then to take to his mercy  The unhappy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Two favours good Madam I have to beg of youThe firstthat you will not let any of my relations know that you have heard from me The otherthat no living creature be apprised where I am to be heard of or directed to This is a point that concerns me more than I can expressIn short my preservation from further evils may depend upon it  LETTER V  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To  HANNAH BURTON  Thursday June    My good  HANNAH  STRANGE things have happened to me since you were dismissed my service so sorely against my will and your pert fellowservant set over me But that must be all forgotten now  How do you my Hannah Are you recovered of your illness If you are Do you choose to come and be with me Or  can  you conveniently  I am a very unhappy creature and being among all strangers should be glad to have  you  with me of whose fidelity and love I have had so many accept∣able instances  Living or dying I will endeavour to make it worth your while my Hannah  If you are recovered as I hope and if you have a good place it may be they would bear with your absence and suffer somebody in your room  for a month or so  And by that time I hope to be pro∣vided for and you may then return to your place  Don't let any of my friends know of this my desire whether you can come or not  I am at Mr Smith's a hosier's and gloveshop in Kingstreet Coventgarden  You must direct to me by the name of Rachel Clark  Do my good Hannah come if you can to your poor young mistress who always valued you and always will whether you come or not  I send this to your mother at St Alban's not knowing where to direct to you Return me a line that I may know what to depend upon And I shall see you have not forgotten the pretty hand you were taught in happy days by  Your true friend  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER VI HANNAH BURTON  In Answer  Monday July    Honored Maddam  I HAVE not forgot to write and never will for∣get any thing you my dear young lady was so good as to larn me I am very sorrowfull for your misfortens my dearest young lady so sorrowfull I do not know what to do Gladd at harte would I be to be able to come to you But indeed I have not been able to stir out of my rome here at my mother's ever since I was forsed to leave my plase with a roomatise which has made me quite and clene  helpless I will pray for you night and day my dearest my kindest my goodest young lady who have been so badly used and I am very sorry I cannot come to do you love and farvice which will ever be in the harte of mee to do if it was in my power Who am  Your most dewtifull sarvant to command  HANNAH BURTON  LETTER VII  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON  Thursday June    My dear Mrs  NORTON  I Address myself to you after a very long silence which however was not owing either to want of love or duty principally to desire you to satisfy me in two or three points which it behoves me to know  My father and all the family I am informed are to be at my uncle Harlowe's this day as usual Pray acquaint me if they have been there And if they were chearful on the anniversary occasion And also if you have heard of any journey or intended journey of my brother in company with Captain Singleton and Mr Solmes  Strange things have happened to me my dear worthy and maternal friendVery strange things Mr Lovelace has proved a very barbarous and in∣grateful man to me But God be praised I have escaped from him Being among absolute strangers tho' I think worthy folks I have written to Hannah Burton to come and be with me If the good crea∣ture fall in your way pray encourage her to come to me I always intended to have her she knows But hoped to be in happier circumstances  Say nothing to any of my friends that you have heard from me  Pray do you think my father would be prevailed upon if I were to supplicate him by letter to take off the heavy curse he laid upon me at my going from HarlowePlaceI can expect no other favour from him But that being literally fulfilled as to my prospects in this life I hope it will be thought to have operated far enough  I am afraid  my Poor  as I used to call the good creatures to whose necessities I was wont to admi∣nister by your faithful hands have missed me of late But now alas I am poor myself It is not the least aggravation of my fault nor of my regrets that with such inclinations as God had given me I have put it out of my power to do the good I once pleased myself to think I was born to do It is a sad thing my dearest Mrs Norton to render our∣selves unworthy of the talents Providence has in∣trusted to us  But these reflections are now too late and perhaps I ought to have kept them to myself Let me however hope that you love me still Pray let me hope that you do And then notwithstanding my misfortunes which have made me seem ingrateful to the kind and truly maternal pains you have taken with me from my cradle I shall have the happiness to think that there is  One  worthy person who hates not  The unfortunate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Pray remember me to my fosterbrother I hope he continues dutiful and good to you  Be pleased to direct for Rachel Clark at Mr Smith's in Kingstreet Coventgarden But keep the direction an absolute secret  LETTER VIII  Mrs  NORTON  In Answer  Saturday July    YOUR letter my dearest young lady cuts me to the heart Why will you not let me know all your distressesYet you have said enough  My son is very good to me A few hours ago he was taken with a feverish disorder But I hope it will go off happily if his ardour for business will give him the recess from it which his good master is willing to allow him He presents his duty to you and shed tears at hearing you sad letter read  You have been misinformed as to your family's being at your uncle Harlowe's They did not in∣tend to be there Nor was the day kept at all Indeed they have not stirred out but to church and that but there times ever since the day you went away Unhappy day for them and forall who know youTo me I am sure most parti∣cularly soMy heart now bleeds more and more for you  I have not heard a syllable of such a journey as you mention of your brother Captain Singleton and Mr Solmes There has been some talk indeed of your brother's setting out for his northern estates But I have not heard of it lately  I am afraid no letter will be received from you It grieves me to tell you so my dearest young lady No evil can have happened to you which they do not  expect  to hear of so great is their antipathy to the wicked man and so bad is his character  I cannot but think hardly of their unforgivingness But there is no judging for others by one's self Ne∣vertheless I will add that if you had had as gentle spirits to deal with as your own or I will be bold to say as mine these evils had never happened either  to them or to you I knew your virtue and your love of virtue from your very cradle and I doubted not but  that  with God's grace would always be your guard But you could never be driven nor was there occasion to drive youSo generous so noble so discreetBut how does my love of your amiable qualities increase my affliction as these re∣collections must do yours  You are escaped my dearest MissHappily I hopeThat is to say with your honour Else how great must be your distressYet from your letter I dread the worst  I am very seldom at Harlowe Place The house is not the house it used to be since you went from it Then they are  so  relentless And as I cannot say harsh things of the beloved child of my  heart  as well as  bosom  they do not take it  amiss  that I stay away  Your Hannah left her place ill some time ago and as she is still at her mother's at St Alban's I am afraid she continues ill If so as you are among strangers and I cannot encourage you at present to come into  these  parts I shall think it my duty to attend you let it be taken as it will as soon as my Tommy's indisposition will permit which I hope will be soon  I have a little money by me You say you  are poor yourself  How grievous are those words from one intitled and accustomed to affluence Will you be so good to command it my beloved young ladyIt is most of it your own bounty to me And I should take a pride to restore it to its original owner  Your Poor bless you and pray for you continually I have so managed your last benevolence and they have been so healthy and have had such constant employ that it has held out and will still hold out  till happier times I hope betide their excellent bene∣factress  Let me beg of you my dearest young lady to take to yourself all those aids which good persons like you draw from RELIGION in support of their calamities Let your sufferings be what they will I am sure you have been innocent in your intention So do not despond None are made to suffer above what they  can  and therefore  ought  to bear  We know not the methods of Providence and what wise ends it may have to serve in its dispensa∣tions to its poor creatures  Few persons have greater reason to say this than myself And since we are apt in calamities to draw more comfort from example than precept you will permit me to remind you of my own lot For who has had a greater share of afflictions than myself  To say nothing of the loss of an excellent mother at a time of life when motherly care is most wanted the death of a dear father who was an ornament to his cloth and who had qualified me to be his scribe and amanuensis just as he came within view of a preferment which would have made his family easy threw me friendless into the wide world threw me upon a very careless and which was much worse a very unkind husband Poor manBut he was spared long enough thank God in a tedious illness to re∣pent of his neglected opportunities and his light principles which I have always thought of with pleasure altho' I was left the more destitute for his chargeable illness and ready to be brought to bed when he died of my Tommy  But this very circumstance which I thought the un∣happiest that I could have been lest in so shortsighted is human prudence became the happy means of re∣commending me to your mother who in regard to my character and in compassion to my very destitute circumstances permitted me as I made a conscience  of not parting with my poor boy to nurse both you and him born within a few days of each other And I have never since wanted any of the humble blessings which God has made me contented with  Nor have I known what a very great grief was from the day of my poor husband's death till the day that your parents told me how much they were de∣termined that you should have Mr Solmes when I was apprised not only of your aversion to him but how unworthy he was of you For then I began to dread the consequences of forcing so generous a spirit and till then I never feared Mr Lovelace attracting as was his person and specious his manners and address For I was sure you would never have him if he gave you not good reason to be convinced of his reforma∣tion nor till your friends were as well satisfied in it as yourself But that unhappy misunderstanding be∣tween your brother and Mr Lovelace and their joining so violently to force you upon Mr Solmes did all that mischief which has cost you and them so dear and poor me all my peace O what has not this ingrateful this doublyguilty man to answer for  Nevertheless you know not what God has in store for you yetBut if you are to be punished all your days here for examplesake in a case of such im∣portance for your one false step be pleased to con∣sider That this life is but a state of probation and if you have your purification in it you will have you reward hereafter in a greater degree for sub∣mitting to the dispensation with patience and resigna∣tion  You see my dearest Miss Clary that I make no scruple to call the step you took a false one In  you  it was less excuseable than it would have been in any other young lady not only because of your superior talents but because of the opposition between  your  character and  his  So that if you had been provoked to quit your father's house it needed not to have been  with him Nor needed I indeed but as an instance of my  impartial  love to have written this to you  Mrs Norton having only the family representation and invectives to form her judgment upon knew not that Clarissa had determined against going off with Mr Lovelace nor how solicitous she had been to pro∣cure for herself  any other  protection than his when she apprehended that if she staid she had no way to avoid being married to Mr Solmes    After this it will have an unkind and perhaps at this time an unseasonable appearance to express my concern that you have not before favour'd me with a lineYet if you can account to yourself for your silence I dare say I ought to be satisfied for I am sure you love me As I both love and honour you and ever will and the more for your misfor∣tunes  One consolation methinks I have even when I am sorrowing for your calamities and that is that I know not any young person so qualified to shine the brighter for the trials she may be exercised with And yet it is a consolation that ends in adding to my regrets for your afflictions because you are blessed with a mind so well able to bear prosperity and to make everybody round you the better for it  Woe unto him  O this wretched wretched manBut I will forbear till I know more  Ruminating on every thing your melancholy letter suggests and apprehending from the gentleness of your mind the amiableness of your person and your youth the further misfortunes and inconveniencies to which you may possibly be subjected I cannot conclude with∣out asking for your leave to attend you and that in a very earnest mannerAnd I beg of you not to deny me on any consideration relating to  myself  or even to the indisposition of my  other  beloved child if I can be either of use or comfort to you Were it my dearest young lady but for two or three days permit me to attend you altho' my son's illness should in∣crease and compel me to come down again at the end of those two or thee daysI repeat my re∣quest  likewise that you will command from me the little sum remaining in my hands of your bounty to your Poor as well as that dispensed to  Your everaffectionate and faithful servant  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER IX  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Lady  BETTY LAWRANCE  Thursday June    Madam  I Hope you'll excuse the freedom of this address from one who has not the honour to be personally known to you altho' you must have heard much of Clarissa Harlowe It is only to beg the favour of a line from your Ladyship's hand by the next post if convenient in answer to the following que∣stions  Whether you wrote a letter dated as I have a memorandum Wedn June congratulating your nephew Lovelace on his supposed nuptials as reported to you by Mr Spurrier your Lady∣ship's steward as from one Captain Tomlinson And in it reproaching Mr Lovelace as guilty of flight  c  in not having acquaint∣ed your Ladyship and the family with his mar∣riage  Whether your Ladyship wrote to Miss Monta∣gue to meet you at Reading in order to at∣tend you to your cousin Leeson's in Albe∣marlestreet on your being obliged to be in town on your  old Chanceryaffair  I remember are the words And whether you bespoke your nephew's attendance there on Sunday night the th  Whether your Ladyship and Miss Montague  did  come to town at that time And whether you went to Hamstead on Monday in a hired  coach and four your own being repairing and took from thence to town the young creature whom you visited there  Your Ladyship will probably guess that these questions are not asked for reasons favourable to your nephew Lovelace But be the answer what it will it can do  him  no hurt nor  me  any good only that I think I owe it to my former hopes however deceived in them and even to charity that a person of whom I was once willing to think better should not prove so egregiously abandon'd as to be wanting in  every  instance to that veracity which is an indispensable in the character of a gentleman  Be pleased Madam to direct to me keeping the direction a secret for the present to be left at the BelleSavage on Ludgatehill till call'd for I am  Your Ladyship's most humble servant  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER X  Lady  BETTY LAWRANCE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Saturday July    Dear Madam  I Find that all is not as it should be between you and my nephew Lovelace It will very much afflict me and all his friends if he has been guilty of any designed baseness to a lady of your character and merit  We have been long in expectation of an opportu∣nity to congratulate you and ourselves upon an event most earnestly wished for by us all since all our hopes of  him  are built upon the power  you  have over him For if ever man adored a woman he is that man and you Madam are that woman  Miss Montague in her last letter to me in answer to one of mine inquiring if she knew from him whether he could call you his or was likely soon to  have that honour has these words  I know not what to make of my cousin Lovelace as to the point your Ladyship is so earnest about He some∣times says He is actually married to Miss Cl Har∣lowe At other times that it is her own fault if he be notHe speaks of her not only with love but with reverence Yet owns that there is a misunderstanding between them but confesses that she is wholly faultless An angel and not a woman he says she is And that no man living can be worthy of her  This is what my niece Montague writes  God grant my dearest young lady that he may not have so heinously offended you that you  cannot  forgive him If you are not already married and refuse to be his I shall lose all hopes that he ever will marry or be the man I wish him to be So will Lord M So will Lady Sarah Sadleir  I will now answer your questions But indeed I hardly know what to write for fear of widening still more the unhappy difference between you But yet such a young lady must command every thing from me This then is my answer  I wrote not any letter to him on or about the th of June  Neither I nor my steward know such a man as Capt Tomlinson  I wrote not to my niece to meet me at Reading nor to accompany me to my cousin Leeson's in town  My Chanceryaffair tho' like most Chanceryaffairs it be of long standing is nevertheless now in so good a way that it cannot give me occasion to go to town  Nor have I been in town these six months Nor at Hamstead for several years  Neither shall I have any temptation to go to town except to pay my congratulatory compliments to  Mrs Lovelace On which occasion I should go with the greatest pleasure and should hope for the favour of your accompanying me to Glen∣hamHall for a month at least  Be what will the reason of your inquiry let me intreat you my dear young lady for Lord M's sake for my sake for this giddy man's sake soul as well as body and for all our family's sakes not to suffer this answer to widen differences so far as to make you re∣fuse him if already he has not the honour of calling you his as I am apprehensive he has not by your signing by your familyname  And here let me offer to you my mediation to compose the difference between you be it what it will Your cause my dear young lady cannot be put into the hands of anybody living more devoted to your service than into those of  Your sincere admirer and humble servant  ELIZ LAWRANCE  LETTER XI  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  HODGES  Enfield  June    Mrs  HODGES  I Am under a kind of necessity to write to you having no one among my relations to whom I dare write or hope a line from if I did It is but  o answer a question It is this  Whether you know such a man as Captain Tom∣linson And if you do whether he be very intimate with my uncle Harlowe  I will describe his person lest possibly he should go by another name among you altho' I know not why he should  He is a thin tallish man a little pockfretten of a sallowish complexion Fifty years of age or more Of a good aspect when he looks up He seems to be a serious man and one who  knows the world He stoops a little in the shoulders Is of Berkshire His wife of Oxfordshire and has several children He removed lately into your parts from Northamptonshire  I must desire you Mrs Hodges that you will not let my uncle nor any of my relations know that I write to you  You used to say that you would be glad to have it in your power to serve me That indeed was in my prosperity But I dare say you will not re∣fuse me in a particular that will oblige me without hurting yourself  I understand that my father mother and sister and I presume my brother and my uncle Antony are to be at my uncle Harlowe's this day God pre∣serve them all and may they rejoice in many happy birthdays You will write six words to me con∣cerning their healths  Direct for a particular reason To Mrs Dorothy Salcomb To be left till call'd for at the Four Swans Inn Bishopsgatestreet  You know my handwriting well enough were not the contents of

Soe noe more frum  Your humbell sarvant to wish you well  SARAH HODGES  LETTER XIII  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Lady  BETTY LAWRANCE  Monday July    Madam  I Cannot excuse myself from giving your Ladyship this one trouble more to thank you as I most heartily do for your kind letter  I must own to you Madam that the honour of being related to Ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to Mr Lovelace's address And the rat  er as I was determined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion  I had another motive which I knew would of it∣self give me merit with you your whole family a pre∣sumptuous  one a punishably presumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that I might be an hum∣ble means in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man who had as I thought good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed or at least gratitude enough to acknowlege the intended obligation whe∣ther the generous hope were to succeed or not  But I have been most egregiously mistaken in Mr Lovelace the only man I persuade myself pre∣tending to be a gentleman in whom I could have been so  much  mistaken For while I was endeavour∣ing to save a drowning wretch I have been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him And he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruined a name that I will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own And this Madam by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with  My whole end is served by your Ladyship's an∣swer to the questions I took the liberty to put to you in writing Nor have I a wish to make the unhappy man more odious to you than is necessary to excuse myself for absolutely declining your offered media∣tion  When your Ladyship shall be informed of the fol∣lowing particulars  That after he had compulsatorily as I may say tricked me into the act of going off with him he could carry me to one of the vilest houses as it proved in London  That he could be guilty of a wicked attempt in resentment of which I found means to escape from him to Hamstead  That after he had found me out there I know not how he could procure two women dressed out richly to personate your Ladyship and Miss Monta∣gue who under pretence of engaging me to make a visit in town to your cousin Leeson promising to  return with me that evening to Hamstead betrayed me back again to the vile house Where again made a prisoner I was first robbed of my senses and then why should I seek to conceal that disgrace from others which I cannot hide from myself of my honour  When your Ladyship shall know That in the shocking progress to this ruin wilful falshoods re∣peated forgeries particularly of one letter from your Ladyship another from Miss Montague and a third from Lord M and numberless perjuries were not the least of his crimes  You will judge That I can have no principles that will make me worthy of an alliance with Ladies of yours and your noble sister's character if I could not from my soul declare that such an alliance can never  now  take place  I will not offer to clear myself intirely of blame But as to  him  I have no fault to accuse myself of My crime was The corresponding with him at first when prohibited so to do by those who had a right to my obedience made still more inexcusable by giving him a clandestine meeting which put me into the power of his arts And for this I am content to be punished Thankful that at last I have escaped from him and have it in my power to reject so wicked a man for my husband And glad if I may be a warning since I cannot be an example Which once very vain and very conceited as I was I pro∣posed to myself to be  All the ill I wish him is That he may reform and that I may be the last victim to his baseness Perhaps this desirable wish may be obtained when he shall see how his wickedness his unmerited wic∣kedness to a poor creature made friendless by his cruel arts will end  I conclude with my humble thanks to your Lady∣ship  for your favourable opinion of me and with the assurance that I will be while life is lent me  Your Ladyship's grateful and obliged servant  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XIV  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON  Sunday Evening July    HOW kindly my beloved Mrs Norton do you soothe the anguish of a bleeding heart Surely you are my own mamma and by some unaccount∣able mistake I must have been laid to a family that having newly found out or at least suspected the imposture cast me from their hearts with the in∣dignation that such a discovery will warrant  O that I had indeed been your own child born to partake of your humble fortunes an heiress only to that content in which you are so happy Then should I have had a  truly  gentle spirit to have guided my ductile heart which force and ungenerous usage sit so ill upon and nothing of what has happened would have been  But let me take heed that I inlarge not by im∣patience the breach already made in my duty by my rashness since had I not erred my  mother  at least could never have been thought hardhearted and unforgiving Am I not then answerable not only for my own faults but for the consequences of them which tend to depreciate and bring disgrace upon a maternal character never before called in question  It is kind however in you to endeavour to exte∣nuate the fault of one so greatly sensible of itAnd could it be wiped off intirely it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my edu∣cation For it must add to your grief as it does to my confusion that after such promising beginnings  I should have so behaved as to be a disgrace instead of a credit to you and my other friends  But that I may not make you think me more guilty than I am give me leave briefly to assure you that when my story is known I shall be intitled to more compassion than blame even on the score of going away with Mr Lovelace  As to all that happened afterwards let me only say that altho' I must call myself a lost creature as to this world yet have I this consolation left me that I have not suffered either for want of circum∣spection or thro' credulity or weakness Not one moment was I off my guard or unmindful of your early precepts But having been enabled to baffle many base contrivances I was at last ruined by arts the most inhuman But had I not been rejected by every friend this lowhearted man had not dared nor would have had opportunity to treat me as he has treated me  More I cannot at this time nor need I say And this I desire you to keep to yourself lest resnt∣ments should be taken up when I am gone that may spread the evil which I hope will end with me  I have been misinformed you say as to my prin∣cipal relations being at my uncle Harlowe's The day you say was not kept Nor have my brother and Mr Solmes AstonishingWhat complicated wickedness has his wretched man to answer for Were I to tell you you would hardly believe there could have been such a heart in man  But one day you may know my whole story At present I have neither inclination nor wordsO my bursting heartYet a happy a wished relief Were you present my tears would supply the rest  I RESUME my pen  And so you fear no letter will be received from me But DON'T  grieve to tell me so  I expect every∣thing  badAnd such is my distress that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the Throne of Mercy I should have been afraid that my father's dreadful curse would be completed with regard to both worlds  For here an additional misfortuneIn a fit of phrensical heedlesness I sent a letter to my beloved Miss Howe without recollecting her private address and it is fallen into her angry mother's hands And so that dear friend perhaps has anew incurred displea∣sure on my account And here too your worthy son is ill and my poor Hannah you think cannot come to me O my dear Mrs Norton  will  you  can  you censure  those  whose resentments against me Heaven seems to approve of and will you acquit  her  whom  that  condemns  Yet you bid me not despondI will not if I can help it And indeed most seasonable conso∣lation has your kind letter afforded me Yet to God Almighty do I appeal to avenge my wrongs and vindicate my inno  But hushed be my stormy passionsHave I not but this moment said that your letter gave me con∣solation May  those  be forgiven who hinder my father from forgiving  me  And this as to  them  shall be the harshest thing that shall drop from my pen  But altho' your son should recover I charge you my dear Mrs Norton that you do not think of coming to me I don't know still but your media∣tion with my mother altho' at present your interpo∣sition would be so little attended to may be of use to procure me the revocation of that most dreadful part of my father's curse which only remains to be ful∣filled The voice of nature must at last be heard in my favour surely It will only plead at first to my friends in the still conscious plaintiveness of a young and unhardened beggar But it will grow more  clamorous when  I  have the courage to be so and shall demand perhaps the paternal protection from further ruin and that forgiveness which those will be little intitled to expect for their own faults who shall interpose to have it refused to me for a  acci∣dental  not a  premeditated  error And which but for them I had never fallen into  But again impatiency founded perhaps on selfpartiality that strange misleader prevails  Let me briefly say that it is necessary to my pre∣sent and future hopes that you keep well with my family And moreover should you come I may be traced out by your means by the most aban∣doned of men Say not then that you think you ought to come up to me  let it be taken as it will  For  my sake  let me repeat were my fosterbrother recovered as I hope he is you must  not  come Nor can I want your advice while  I  can write and  you  can answer me And write I will as often as I stand in need of your counsel  Then the people I am now with seem to be both honest and humane And there is in the same house a widowlodger of low fortunes but of great merit Almost such another serious and good woman as the dear one to whom I am now writing who has as she says given over all other thoughts of the world but such as shall assist her to leave it happilyHow suitable to my own viewsThere seems to be a comfortable providence in  this  at leastSo that at present there is nothing of exigence nothing that can  require  or even  excuse  your coming when so many better ends may be answered by your staying where you are A time  may  come when I shall want your last and best assistance And  then  my dear Mrs Norton And  then  I will bespeak it and em∣brace it with my whole heart And  then  will it not be denied me by anybody  You are very obliging in your offer of money But  altho' I was forced to leave my cloaths behind me yet I took several things of value with me which will keep me from present want You'll say I have made a miserable hand of it So indeed I have and to look backward in a very little while too  But what shall I do if my father cannot be pre∣vailed upon to recal his grievous maledictionOf all the very heavy evils wherewith I have been af∣flicted this is  now  the heaviest for I can neither live nor die under it  O my dear Mrs Norton what a weight must a father's curse have upon a mind so apprehensive of it as mine isDid I think I should ever have  this  to deprecate  But you must not be angry with me that I wrote not to you before You are very right and very kind to say You are sure I love you Indeed I do And what a generosity is there so like yourself in your praise to attribute to me more than I merit in order to raise an emulation in me to  deserve  your praises You tell me what you expect from me in the calamities I am called upon to bear May I but behave answerably  I  can  a little account  to myself  for my silence to you my kind my dear maternal friend how equally sweetly and politely do you express yourself on this occasion I was very desirous for your sake as well as for my own that you should have it to say that we did not correspond Had they thought we did every word you could have dropt in my favour would have been rejected and my mother would have been forbid to see you or to pay any regard to what you should say  They I had sometimes better and sometimes worse prospects before me My worst would only have troubled you to know My better made me fre∣quently hope that by the next post or the next and so on for weeks I should have the best news to  impart to you that  then  could happen cold as the wretch had made my heart to  that Best  For how could I think to write to you with a confession that I was not married yet lived in the house nor could I help it with such a manWho likewise had given it out to several that we were actually mar∣ried altho' with restrictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends And to disguise the truth or be guilty of a falshood either direct or equi∣vocal that was what you had never learnt me  But I might have written to you for advice in my precarious situation perhaps you will think But indeed my dear Mrs Norton I was not lost for want of advice And this will appear clear to you from what I have already hinted were I to explain myself no further For what need had the cruel spoiler to have had recourse to unprecedented artsI will speak out plainer still but you must not at pre∣sent report it to stupefying potions and to the most brutal and outrageous force had I been want∣ing in my duty  A few words more upon this grievous subject  When I reflect upon all that has happened to me it is apparent that this generallysupposed  thought∣less  seducer has acted by me upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villainy  In order to set all his vile plots in motion nothing was wanting from the first but to prevail upon me either by force or fraud to throw myself into his power And when this was effected nothing less than the intervention of the paternal authority which I had not deserved to be exerted in my behalf could have saved me from the effect of his deep machina∣tions Opposition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and in∣grateful violence And had  you yourself  been with me I have reason  now  to think that somehow or other you would have suffered in endeavouring to save me  For never was there as now I see a plan of wicked∣ness more steadily and uniformly pursued than  his  has been against an unhappy creature who merited better of  him  But the Almighty has thought fit ac∣cording to the general course of his providence to make the fault bring on its own punishment And that perhaps in consequence of my father's dread∣ful imprecation "That I might be punished  here  " O my mamma Norton pray with me that  here  it stop  by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence  I am sorry for your sake to leave off so heavily Yet the rest must be brief  Let me desire you to be secret in what I have com∣municated to you at least till you have my con∣sent to divulge it  God preserve to you your more faultless child  I will hope for His mercy altho' I should not ob∣tain that of any other person  And I repeat my prohibitionYou must not think of coming up to  Your everdutiful  CL HARLOWE  The obliging person who left yours for me this day promised to call tomorrow to see if I should have anything to return I would not lose so good an opportunity  LETTER XV  Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday Night July    O The barbarous villainly of this detestable man  And is there a man in the world who could offer violence to so sweet a creature  And are you sure you are now out of his reach  You command me to keep secret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with or else upon an unexpected visit which Miss Harlowe fa∣voured  me with soon after I had received your me∣lancholy letter I should have been tempted to own I had heard from you and to have communicated to her such parts of your two letters as would have de∣monstrated your penitence and your earnestness to obtain the revocation of your father's malediction as well as his protection from outrages that may still be offered to you But then your sister would pro∣bably have expected a sight of the letters and even to been have permitted to take them with her to the family  Yet they  must  one day be acquainted with the sad storyAnd it is impossible but they must pity you and forgive you when they know your early peni∣tence and your unprecedented sufferings and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravisher and not by the vile arts of a seducing lover  The wicked man gives it out at Lord M's as Miss Harlowe tells me that he is actually married to youYet she believes it not nor had I the heart to let her know the truth  She put it close to me Whether I had not cor∣responded with you from the time of your going away I could safely tell her as I did that I had not But I said that I was well informed that you took extremely to heart your father's imprecation and that if she would excuse me I would say it would be a kind and sisterly part if she would use her interest to get you discharged from it  Among other severe things she told me that my partial fondness for you made me very little consider the honour of the rest of the family But if I had not heard this from you she supposed I was set on by Miss Howe  She expressed herself with a good deal of bitterness against that young lady Who it seems everywhere and to everybody for you must think that your story is the subject of all conversations rails  against your family treating them as your sister says with contempt and even with ridicule  I am sorry such angry freedoms are taken for two reasons first Because such liberties never do any good I have heard you own that Miss Howe has a satiri∣cal vein but I should hope that a young lady of her sense and right cast of mind must know that the end of satire is not to exasperate but amend and should never be personal If it be as my good father used to say it may make an impartial person suspect that the satirist has a natural spleen to gra∣tify which may be as great a fault in  him  as any of those which he pretends to censure and expose in  others  Perhaps a hint of this from you will not be thrown away  My second reason is That these freedoms from so warm a friend to you as Miss Howe is known to be are most likely to be charged to your account  My resentments are so strong against this vilest of men that I dare not touch upon the shocking par∣ticulars which you mention of his baseness What defence indeed could there be against so determined a wretch after you were in his power I will only repeat my earnest supplication to you that black as appearances are you will not despair You cala∣mities are exceeding great but then you have ta∣lents proportioned to your trials This everybody allows  Suppose the worst and that your family will not be moved in your favour your cousin Morden will soon arrive as Miss Harlowe told me If he should even be got over to their side he will however see justice done you and then may you live an exem∣plary life making hundreds happy and teaching young ladies to shun the snares in which you have been so dreadfully intangled  As to the man you have lost Is an union with  such a perjured heart as his with such an admirable one as yours to be wished for A base  lowhearted  wretch as you justly call him with all his pride of ancestry and more an enemy to himself with re∣gard to his present and future happiness than to you in the barbarous and ingrateful wrongs he has done you I need not I am sure exhort you to despise such a man as this since not to be able to do so would be a reflection upon a sex to which you have always been an honour  Your moral character is untainted The very na∣ture of your sufferings as you well observe demon∣strates  that  Chear up therefore your dear heart and do not despair For is it not GOD who governs the world and permits some things and directs others as He pleases And will he not reward  tem∣porary sufferings  innocently incurred and piously supported with  eternal felicity  And what my dear is this poor needle's point of NOW to a  bound∣less  ETERNITY  My heart however labours under a double af∣fliction For my poor boy is very very badA violent feverNor can it be brought to intermit Pray for  him  my dearest Miss for his recovery if God see fit I hope God  will  see fitIf not how can I bear to suppose That pray for  me  that he will give me that patience and resignation which I have been wishing to you I am my dearest young lady  Your everaffectionate  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER XVI  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON  Thursday July    I Ought not especially at this time to add to your afflictionsBut yet I cannot help communicating  to you who now are my  only  soothing friend a new trouble that has befallen me  I had but one friend in the world besides you and she is utterly displeased with me  See the next Letter  It is griev∣ous but for one moment to lie under a beloved person's censure and this through imputations that affect one's honour and prudence There are points so delicate you know my dear Mrs Norton that it is a degree of dishonour to have a vindication of one's self from them appear to be  necessary  In the present case my misfortune is that I know not how to account but by guess so subtle have been the workings of the dark spirit I have been unhap∣pily intangled by for some of the facts that I am called upon to explain  Miss Howe in short supposes she has found a flaw in my character I have just now received her severe letter But I shall answer it perhaps in bet∣ter temper if I first consider yours For indeed my patience is almost at an end And yet I ought to consider  That faithful are the wounds of a friend  But so  many  things at once O my dear Mrs Norton how shall so young a scholar in the school of affliction be able to bear such heavy and such va∣rious evils  But to leave this subject for a while and turn to your letter  I am very sorry Miss Howe is so lively in her re∣sentments on my account I have always blamed her very freely for her liberties of this sort with my friends I once had a good deal of influence over her kind heart and she made all I said a law to her But people in calamity have but little weight in anything or with anybody Prosperity and independ∣ence are charming things on this account that they give force to the counsels of a friendly heart while  it is thought insolence in the miserable to advise or so much as remonstrate  Yet is Miss Howe an invaluable person And is it to be expected that she should preserve the same regard for my judgment that she had before I for∣feited all title to discretion With what face can I take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in  her  But if I can be so happy as to reestablish myself in her evervalued opinion I shall endeavour to inforce upon her your just observations on this head  You need not you say exhort me to despise such a man as him by whom I have sufferedIndeed▪ you need not For I would choose the cruellest death rather than to be his And yet my dear Mrs Norton I will own to you that once I could have loved him Ingrateful man had he permitted me I  once  could have loved him Yet he never deserved my love And was not this a fault But now if I can but keep out of his hands and procure the revocation of my father's malediction it is all I wish for  Reconciliation with my friends I do not expect nor pardon from them at least till in extremity and as a  viaticum  O my beloved Mrs Norton you cannot imagine what I have sufferedBut indeed my heart is bro∣ken I am sure I shall not live to take possession of that independence which you think would enable me to atone in some measure for my past conduct  While this is my opinion you may believe I shall not be easy till I can procure the revocation of that dreadful curse and if possible a last forgiveness  I wish to be left to take my own course in en∣deavouring to procure this grace Yet know I not at present what that course shall be  I will write But to  whom  is my doubt Cala∣mity has not yet given me the assurance to address myself to my FATHER My UNCLES well as they  once loved me are hardhearted They never had their masculine passions humanized by the tender name of FATHER Of my BROTHER I have no hope I have then but my MOTHER and my SIS∣TER to whom I can apply  And may I not my dearest Mamma be permitted to lift up my trembling eye to your allchearing and your once  more  than indulgent your  fond  eye in hopes of seasonable mercy to the poor sick heart that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart Especially when pardon only and not restoration is implored  Yet were I able to engage my mother's pity would it not be a means to make  her  still more unhappy than I have already made her by the opposition she would meet with were she to try to give force to that pity  To my SISTER then I think I will apply Yet how hard hearted has my sister beenBut I will not ask for protection and yet I am in hourly dread that I shall want protection All I will ask for shall be only to be freed from the heavy curse that has operated as far as it  can  operate as to  this  life And surely it was passion and not intention that carried it so very far as to the  other  But why do I thus add to your distresses It is not my dear Mrs Norton that I have so  much  feeling for my  own  calamity that I have  none  for  yours  Since yours is indeed an addition to my own But you have one consolation a very great one which I have notThat  your  afflictions whether respect∣ing your  more  or your  less  deserving child rise not from any fault of your own  But what can I do for you more than prayAs∣sure yourself that in every supplication I put up for myself I will with equal fervor remember both you and your son For I am and ever will be  Your truly sympathizing and dutiful  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XVII  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed For Mrs  RACHEL CLARK  c  Wednesday July    My dear  CLARISSA  I Have at last heard from you from a quarter I little expected  From my mamma  She had for some time seen me uneasy and grieving and justly supposed it was about you And this morn∣ing dropt a hint which made me conjecture that she must have heard something of you more than I knew And when she found that this added to my uneasiness she owned she had a letter in her hands of yours dated the th of June directed for me  You may guess that this occasion'd a little warmth that could not be wished for by either  It is surprising my dear  mighty  surprising that knowing the prohibition I lay under of corresponding with you you could send a letter for me to our own house Since it must be fifty to one that it would fall into my mother's hands as you find it did  In short  she  resented that I should disobey her  I  was as much concerned that she should open and withhold from me  my  letters And at last she was pleased to compromise the matter with me by giving up the letter and permitting me to write to you  once  or  twice  she to see the contents of what I wrote For besides the value she has for you she could not but have a great curiosity to know the oc∣casion of so sad a situation as your melancholy let∣ter shews you to be in  But I shall get her to be satisfied with hearing me read what I write putting in between hooks thus what I intend not to read to her  Need I to remind you Miss Cl Harlowe of  three  letters I wrote to you to none of which I had any  answer except to the  first  and that a few lines only promising a letter at large tho' you were well enough the day after you received my  second  to go joyfully back again with him to the vile house But more of these byandby I must hasten to take notice of your letter of Wednesday last week which you could  contrive  should fall into my mother's hands  Let me tell you that that letter has almost broken my heart Good God what have you brought yourself to Miss Clarissa HarloweCould I have believed that after you had escaped from the mis∣creant with such mighty pains and earnestness escaped and after such an attempt as he had made you would have been prevailed upon not only to forgive him but without being married too to re∣turn with him to that horrid houseA house I had given you such an account ofSurprisingWhat an intoxicating thing is  this Love  I  always  feared that You even You were not proof against it  You your  best self  have not escaped Indeed I see not how you could expect to escape  What a tale have you to unfold  You need not un∣fold it my dear I would have engaged to prognosti∣cate all that has happen'd had you but told me that you would once more have put yourself into his power after you had taken such pains to get out of it  Your peace is destroyed  I wonder not at it Since now you must reproach yourself for a credulity so illplaced  Your intellect is touch'd  I am sure my heart bleeds for you But excuse me my dear I doubt your intellect was touch'd before you left Hamstead or you would never have let him find you out there or when he did suffer him to prevail upon you to return to the horrid brothel  I tell you  I sent you  three letters  The  first  of which dated the th and th of June  See Vol  iv  p    for it was  wrote at twice came safe to your hands as you sent me word by a few lines dated the ninth Had it not I should have doubted my own safety since in it I gave you such an account of the abominable house and threw such cautions in your way as to that Tomlinson as the more surprised me that you could think of going back to it again after you had escaped from it and from LovelaceO my dear But nothing now will I ever wonder at  The  second  dated June  See Vol  v  p    was given into your own hand at Hamstead on Sunday the th as you was lying upon a couch in a strange way ac∣cording to my messenger's account of you bloated and flushcoloured I don't know how  The  third  was dated the th of June  Ibid p    Hav∣ing not heard one word from you since the promising billet of the th I own I did not spare you in it I ventured it by the usual conveyance by that Wil∣son's having no other So cannot be sure you re∣ceived it Indeed I rather think you might not be∣cause in yours which fell into my mamma's hands you make no mention of it And if you had had it I believe it would have touch'd you too much to have been passed by unnoticed  You have heard that I have been ill you say I had a cold indeed but it was so slight a one that it confined me not an hour But I doubt not that strange things you have  heard  and  been told  to induce you to take the step you took And till you did take that step the going back with this villain I mean I knew not a more pitiable case than yours For every body must have excused you before who knew how you was used at home and was ac∣quainted with your prudence and vigilance But alas my dear we see that the  wisest people  are not to be depended upon when  Love  like an  ignis fatuus  holds up its misleading lights before their eyes  My mother tells me she sent you an answer de∣siring you not to write to me because it would grieve me To be sure I  am  grieved  exceedingly  grieved and  disappointed  too you must permit me to say For I had always thought that there never was such a woman at your years in the world  But I remember once an argument you held on occasion of a censure passed in company upon an ex∣cellent preacher who was not a very excellent liver  Preaching  and  practising  you said required quite different talents Which when united in the same person made the man a saint as  wit  and  judgment  going together constituted a genius  You made it out I remember very prettily But you never made it out excuse me my dear more convincingly than by that part of your late conduct which I complain of  My love for you and my concern for your honour may possibly have made me a little of the severest If you think so place it to its proper account To  That  love and to  That  concern Which will but do justice to  Your afflicted and faithful  A H  POSTSCRIPT  My mother would not be satisfied without reading my letter herself and that before I had fixed my proposed hooks She knows by this means and has excused our former correspondence  She indeed suspected it before And so she very well might know∣ing Me and knowing my love of You  She has so much real concern for your misfortunes that thinking it will be a consolation to  you  and that it will oblige  me  she con∣sents that you shall write to me the  particulars at large of your sad story  But it is on condition that I shew her all that has passed between us relating to yourself and the vilest of men I have the more chearfully complied as the communication cannot be to your disadvantage  You may therefore write freely and direct to our own house  My mother promises to shew me the copy of her letter to you and your reply to it which latter she has but just told me of She already apologizes for the severity of hers And thinks the sight of your reply will affect me too much But having her promise I will not dispense with it  I doubt hers is severe enough So I fear you will think mine But you have taught me never to spare the  fault  for the  friend's  sake and that a great error ought rather to be more inexcuseable in the person we value than in one we are indifferent to because it is a reflection upon our choice of that person and tends to a breach of the love of mind and to expose us to the world for our partiality To the  love of mind  I repeat since it is impossible but the errors of the dearest friend must weaken our inward opinion of that friend and thereby lay a foundation for future distance and perhaps disgust  God grant that you may be able to clear your conduct  after  you had escaped from Hamstead as all  before  that time was noble gene∣rous and prudent The man a devil and you a saintYet I hope you can and therefore expect it from you  I send by a particular hand He will call for your answer at your own appointment  I am afraid this horrid wretch will trace out by the postoffices where you are if not careful  To have  Money  and  Will  and  Head  to be a villain is too much for the rest of the world when they meet in one man  LETTER XVIII  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Thursday July    FEW young persons have been able to give more convincing proofs than myself how little true happiness lies in the enjoyment of our own wishes  To produce one instance only of the truth of this ob∣servation What would I have given for weeks past for the favour of a letter from my dear Miss Howe in whose friendship I placed all my remaining comfort Little did I think that the next letter she would honour me with should be in such a stile as should make me look more than once at the subscription that I might be sure the name not being written at length that it was not signed by another A H For surely thought I this is my sister Arabella's style Surely Miss Howe blame me as she pleases in other points could never repeat so  sharply  upon her friend words written in the bitterness of spirit and in the disorder of head nor remind her with asperity and with mingled strokes of wit of an argument held in the gaiety of an heart elated with prosperous fortunes as  mine then was and very little apprehensive of the severe turn that argument would one day take against herself  But what have  I  sunk in my fortunes my cha∣racter forfeited my honour lost While  I  know it I care not  who  knows it destitute of friends and even of hope What have  I  to do to shew a spirit of repining and expostulation to a dear friend because she is not  more  kind than a sister  I find by the rising bitterness which will mingle with the gall in my ink that I am not yet subdued enough to my condition And so begging your par∣don that I should rather have formed my expecta∣tions of favour from the indulgence you  used  to shew me than from what I  now deserve  to have shewn me I will endeavour to give a particualr answer to your letter altho' it will take me up too much time to think of sending it by your messenger tomorrow He can put off his journey he says till Saturday I will endeavour to have the whole narrative ready for you by Saturday  But how to defend myself in every thing that has happened I cannot tell Since in some part of the time in which my conduct appears to have been cen∣surable I was not myself and to this hour know not all the methods taken to deceive and ruin me  You tell me that in your first letter you gave me such an account of the vile house I was in and such cautions about that Tomlinson as make you won∣der how I could think of going back  Alas my dear I was trick'd most vilely trick'd back as you shall hear in its place  Without  knowing  the house was so very  vile  a house from your  intended  information I disliked the people too much ever  voluntarily  to have returned to it But had you really written such cautions about Tomlinson and the house as you seem to have  pur∣posed  to do they must had they come in time have  been of infinite service to me But not one word of either whatever was your  intention  did you men∣tion to me in that  first  of the  three  letters you so warmly TELL ME you  did  send me  I will inclose it to convince you  The letter she incloses was Mr Lovelace's forged one See Vol  v  p    seq    But your account of your messenger's delivering to me your second letter and the description he gives of me as  lying upon a couch in a strange way bloated and flushcoloured you don't know how  absolutely puzzles and confounds me  Lord have mercy upon the poor Clarissa Harlowe What can this mean  Who  was the messenger you sent Was  he  one of Lovelace's creatures too Could nobody come near me but that man's con∣federates either  setting out so  or  made so  I know not what to make of any one syllable of thisIn∣deed I don't  Let me see You say this was  before  I went from HamsteadMy intellects had not then been touch'dNor had I ever been surprised by wine strange if I had How then could I be found in such a  strange way bloated and flushcoloured you don't know how  Yet what a vile what a hateful figure has your messenger represented me to have made  But indeed I know nothing of ANY messenger from you  Believing myself secure at Hamstead I staid longer there than I would have done in hopes of the letter promised me in your short one of the th brought me by my own messenger in which you undertake to send for and engage Mrs Townsend in my fa∣vour  See Vol  v  p      I wonder'd I heard not from you And was told you were sick and at another time that your  mother and you had had words on my account and that you had refused to admit Mr Hickman's visits upon it So that I supposed at one time that you was not  able  to write at another that your mo∣ther's prohibition had its  due  force with you But now I have no doubt that the wicked man must have intercepted your letter and I wish he found not means to  corrupt your messenger  to tell you so strange a story  It was on Sunday June you say that the man gave it me I was at church twice that day with Mrs Moore Mr Lovelace was at her house the while where he boarded and wanted to have lodged but I would not permit that tho' I could not help the other In one of these spaces  it must be  that he had time to work upon the man You'll easily my dear find that out by inquiring the time of his arrival at Mrs Moore's and other circumstances of the  strange way  he pretended to see me in  on a couch  and the rest  Had anybody seen me afterwards when I was betray'd back to the vile house struggling under the operation of wicked potions and robb'd  indeed  of my intellects for this as you shall hear was my dreadful case I might then perhaps have ap∣peared  bloated  and  flushcoloured  and  I know not how myself  But were you to see your poor Clarissa  now  or even to have seen her at Hamstead  before  she suffered the vilest of all outrages you would not think her  bloated  or  flushcoloured  Indeed you would not  In a word it could not be  me  your messenger saw nor if anybody who it was can I divine  I will now as  briefly  as the subject will permit enter into the darker part of my sad story And yet I must be somewhat circumstantial that you may not think me capable of  reserve  or  palliation  The  latter  I am not conscious that I need I should be utterly  inexcuseable were I guilty of the  former  to you And yet if you knew how my heart sinks under the thoughts of a recollection so painful you would pity me  As I shall not be able perhaps to conclude what I have to write in even two or three letters I will be∣gin a new one with my story and send the whole of it together altho' written at different periods as I am able  Allow me a little pause my dear at this place and to subscribe my self  Your everaffectionate and obliged  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Referred to in Vol V p  Thursday Night  HE had found me out at Hamstead Strangely found me out for I am still at a loss to know by what means  I was loth in my billet of the th  See Vol  V  p    to tell you so for fear of giving you apprehensions for me and be∣sides I hoped then to have a shorter and happier issue account to you for thro' your assistance than I met with  She then gives a narrative of all that passed at Ham∣stead between herself Mr Lovelace Capt Tomlin∣son and the women there to the same effect with that so amply given by Mr Lovelace  Mr Lovelace finding all he could say and all Capt Tomlinson could urge ineffectual to prevail upon me to forgive an outrage so flagrantly premeditated rested all his hopes on a visit which was to be paid me by Lady Betty Lawrance and Miss Montague  In my uncertain situation my prospects all so dark I knew not to whom I might be obliged to have recourse in the last resort And as those ladies had the best of cha∣racters insomuch that I had reason to regret that I had not from the first thrown my self upon their protection when I had forfeited  that  of my own friends I thought  I would not  shun  an interview with them though I was too indifferent to their kinsman to  seek  it as I doubted not that one end of their visit would be to reconcile me to him  On Monday the th of June these pretended ladies came to Hamstead and I was presented to them and they to me by their kinsman  They were richly dressed and stuck out with jewels the pretended Lady Betty's were particularly very fine  They came in a coach and four hired as was con∣fessed while their own was repairing in town A pre∣tence made I now perceive that I should not guess at the imposture by the want of the real Lady's arms upon it Lady Betty was attended by her woman whom she called Morrison a modest countrylooking person  I had heard that Lady Betty was a fine woman and that Miss Montague was a beautiful young lady genteel and graceful and full of vivacity Such were these im∣postors and having never seen either of them I had not the least suspicion that they were not the ladies they personated and being put a little out of countenance by the richness of their dresses I could not help fool that I was to apologize for my own  The pretended Lady Betty then told me that her ne∣phew had acquainted them with the situation of affairs between us And altho' she could not but say that she was very glad that he had not put such a slight upon his Lordship and them as report had given them cause to ap∣prehend the reasons for which report however she much approved of yet it had been matter of great concern to her and to her niece Montague and would to the whole family to find so great a misunderstanding subsisting be∣tween us as if not made up might distance all their hopes  She could easily tell who was in fault she said And gave him a look both of anger and disdain asking him How it was possible for him to give an offence of  such  a nature to so charming a lady so she called me as should occasion a resentment so strong  He pretended to be awed into shame and silence  My dearest niece said she and took my hand I  must  call you niece as well from love as to humour your un∣cle's  laudable expedient permit me to be not an advo∣cate but a mediatrix for him and not for his sake so much as for my own my Charlotte's and all our family's The indignity he has offered to you may be of too ten∣der a nature to be inquired into But as he declares that it was not a premeditated offence whether my dear for I was going to rise upon it in my temper it were or not and as he declares his sorrow for it and never did creature express a deeper sorrow for any offence than he and as it is a reparable one let  Us  for this one time forgive him and thereby lay an obligation upon this man of errorsLet US I say my dear For Sir turn∣ing to him an offence against such a peerless lady as This must be an offence against  me  against your  cousin  here and against  all the virtuous  of our Sex  See my dear what a creature he had picked out Could you have thought there was a woman in the world who could thus express herself and yet be vile But she had her principal instructions from him and those written down too as I have reason to think For I have recollected since that I once saw this Lady Betty who often rose from her seat and took a turn to the other end of the room with such emotion as if the joy of her heart would not let her sit still take out a paper from her stays and look into it and put it there again She might oftener and I not observe it for I little thought that there could be such impostors in the world  I could not forbear paying great attention to what she said I found tears ready to start I drew out my hand∣kerchief and was silent I had not been so indulgently treated a great while by a person of character and distin∣ction such I thought her and durst not trust to the accent of my voice  The pretended Miss Montague joined in on this occa∣sion and drawing her chair close to me took my other hand and besought me to forgive her cousin and consent to rank myself as one of the principals of a family that had long very long coveted the honour of my alliance  I am ashamed to repeat to you my dear now I know what wretches they are the tender the obliging and the respectful things I said to them  The wretch himself then came forward He threw himself at my feet How was I besetThe women grasping one my right hand the other my left The pre∣tended Miss Montague pressing to her lips more than once the hand she held The wicked man on his knees imploring my forgiveness and setting before me my happy and my unhappy prospects as I should forgive or not forgive him All that he thought would affect me in his former pleas and those of Capt Tomlinson he repeated He vowed he promised he bespoke the pre∣tended ladies to answer for him and they engaged their honours in his behalf  Indeed my dear I was distressed perfectly distressed I was sorry that I had given way to this visit For I knew not how in tenderness to relations as I thought them so worthy to treat so freely as he deserved a man nearly allied to themSo that my arguments and my resolutions were deprived of their greatest force  I pleaded however my application to you I expected every hour I told them an answer from you to a letter I had written which would decide my future destiny  They offered to apply to you themselves in person in  their own behalf  as they politely termed it They be∣sought me to write to you to hasten your answer  I said I was sure that you would write the moment that the event of an application to be made to a third person enabled you to writeBut as to the success of their re∣quests in behalf of their kinsman That depended not upon the expected answer for  that  I begged their pardon was out of the question I wished him well I wished him happy But I was convinced that I neither could make  him  so nor he  me  Then again how the wretch promisedHow he vow∣edHow he intreatedAnd how the women pleaded And they engaged themselves and the honour of their whole family for his just his kind his tender behaviour to me  In short my dear I was so hard set that I was obliged to come to a more favourable compromise with them than I had intended I would wait for your answer to my letter I said And if it made doubtful or difficult  the change of measures I had resolved upon and the scheme of life I had formed I would then consider of the matter and if they would permit me lay all before them and take their advice upon it it conjunction with yours as if the one were my own aunt and the other were my own cousin  They shed tears upon thisOf joy they called them But since I believe to their credit bad as they are that they were tears of temporary remorse for the pretended Miss Montague turned about and as I remember said There was no standing it  But Mr Lovelace was not so easily satisfied He was fixed upon his villainous measures perhaps and so might not be sorry to have a pretence against me He bit his lipHe had been but too much used he said to such indifference such coldness in the very midst of his happiest prospectsI had on twenty occasions shewn him to his infinite regret that any favour I was to confer upon him was to be the result ofThere he stopAnd not of my choice  This had like to have set all back again I was exceed∣ingly offended But the pretended ladies interposed The elder severely took him to t  sk He ought she told him to be satisfied with what I had said She  d  sired  no other condition And what Sir said she with an air of authority would you commit errors and expect to be  rewarded  for them  They then engaged me in more agreeable conversa∣tionThe pretended Lady declared that she Lord M and Lady Sarah would directly and personally interest them∣selves to bring about a general reconciliation between the two families and this either in open or private concert with my uncle Harlowe as should be thought fit Ani∣mosities on one side had been carried a great way she said and too little care had been shewn on the other to mollify or heal My father should see that they could treat him as a brother and a friend and my brother and sister should be convinced that there was no room either for the jealousy or envy they had conceived from mo∣tives too unworthy to be avowed  Could I help my dear being pleased with them  Permit me here to break off The task grows too heavy at present for the heart of  Your  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  In Continuation  I WAS very ill and obliged to lay down my pen I thought I should have fainted But am better nowSo will proceed  The pretended Ladies the more we talked seemed to be the fonder of me And  The  Lady Betty had Mrs Moore called up and asked her If she had accommodations for her niece and self her woman and two menservants for three or four days  Mr Lovelace answered for her that she had  She would not ask her dear niece Lovelace  Permit me my dear  whispered she  this charming style before strangers I will keep your uncle's secret  whether she should be welcome or not to be so near her But for the time she should stay in these parts she would come up every nightWhat say  you  niece Charlotte  The pretended Charlotte answered she should like to do so of all things  The  Lady Betty called her an obliging girl She liked the placed she said Her cousin Leeson would excuse her The air and my company would do her good She ne∣ver chose to lie in the smoaky town if she could help it In short my dear said she to me I will stay till you hear from Miss Howe and till I have your consent to go with me to GlenhamHall Not one moment will I be out of your company when I can have it Stedman my solicitor as the distance from town is so small may attend me here for instructions Niece Charlotte one word with you child  They retired to the farther end of the room and talked about their nightdresses  The  Miss Charlotte said Morrison might be dispatched for them  True the other saidBut she had some letters in  her private box which she must have up And you know Charlotte that I trust nobody with the keys of that  Could not Morrison bring up that box  No She thought it safest where it was She had heard of a robbery committed but two days ago at the foot of Hamsteadhill and she should be ruined if she lost her box  Well then it was but going to town to undress and she would leave her jewels behind her and return and should be the easier a great deal on all accounts  For my part I wondered they came up with them But that was to be taken as a respect paid to me And then they hinted at another visit of ceremony which they had thought to make had they not found me so inex∣pressibly engaging  They talked loud enough for me to hear them on purpose no doubt tho' in affected whispers and con∣cluded with high praises of me  I was not fool enough to believe or to be puffed up with their encomiums yet not suspecting them I was not displeased at so favourable a beginning of acquaint∣ance with ladies whether I were to be related to them or not of whom I had always heard honourable men∣tion And yet at the time I thought highly as they exalted  me  that in some respects tho' I hardly knew in what they fell short of what I expected  them  to be  The grand deluder was at the farther end of the room another way probably to give me an opportunity to hear these preconcerted praiseslooking into a book which had there not been a preconcert would not have taken his attention for one moment It was  Taylor's Holy Living and Dying  When the pretended ladies joined me he approached me with it in his handA smart book This my dear This old divine affects I see a mighty flowery stile upon a very solemn subject But it puts me in mind of an ordinary country funeral where the young women in honour of a defunct companion especially if she were a virgin or  passed for such  make a flowerbed of her coffin  And then laying down the book turning upon his  heel with one of his usual airs of gaiety And are you determined Ladies to take up your lodgings with my charming creature  Indeed they were  Never were there more cunning more artful impostors than these women Practised creatures to be sure Yet genteel and they must have been welleducatedOnce perhaps as much the delight of their parents as I was of mine And who knows by what arts ruined body and mindO my dear how pregnant is this reflection  But the  man  Never was there a man so deep Never so consummate a deceiver except that detested Tomlin∣son whose years and seriousness joined with a solidity of sense and judgment that seemed uncommon gave him one would have thought advantages in villainy the other had not time for Hard very hard that I should fall into the knowlege of two such wretches when two more such I hope are not to be met with in the worldBoth so determined to carry on the most bar∣barous and perfidious projects against a poor young crea∣ture who never did or wished harm to either  Take the following slight account of these womens and of this man's behaviour to each other before me  Mr Lovelace carried himself to his pretended aunt with high respect and paid a great deference to all she said He permitted her to have all the advantage over him in the repartees and retorts that passed between them I could indeed easily see that it  was  permitted and that he forbore that  acumen  that quickness which he never spared shewing to the pretended Miss Montague and which a man of wit seldom knows how to spare shewing when an opportunity offers to display his wit  The pretended Miss Montague was still more reverent in her behaviour to her aunt While the aunt kept up the dignity of the character she had assumed raillying both of them with the air of a person who depends upon the superiority which years and fortune give over younger persons who might have a view to be obliged to her either in her life or at her death  The severity of her raillery however was turned upon Mr Lovelace on occasion of the character of the  people who kept the lodgings which she said I had thought my self so well warranted to leave privately  This startled me For having then no suspicion of the vile Tomlinson I concluded and your letter of the th  His forged letter See Vol  V  p    favoured my conclusions that if the house were notorious either he or Mr Mennell would have given me or him some hints of itNor altho' I liked not the people did I observe any thing in them very culpable till the Wednesday night before that they offered not to come to my assistance altho' within hearing of my di∣stress as I am sure they were and having as much reason to be frighted as I at the fire had it been real  I looked with indignation upon Mr Lovelace at this hint  He seemed abashed I have not patience but to re∣collect the specious looks of this vile deceiver But how was it possible that even this florid countenance of his should enable him to command a blush at his pleasure For blush he did more than once And the blush on this occasion was a deepdyed crimson unstrained for and natural as I thoughtBut he is so much of the actor that he seems able to enter into any character and his muscles and features appear intirely under obe∣dience to his wicked will  It is proper to observe th  t there was a more natural reason than this that the lady gives for Mr Lovelace's blushing It was a blush of indign  tion as he owned afterwards to his friend Belford in conversation for his pretended aunt had mistaken her cue in con∣demning the house and he had much ado to recover the blunder being obliged to follow her lead and vary from his first design which was To have the people of the house spoken well of in order to induce her to return to it were it but on pretence to direct her cloaths to be carr  ed to Hamstead    The pretended Lady went on saying She had taken upon herself to inquire after the people on hearing that I had left the house in disgust and tho' she heard not any thing much amiss yet she heard enough to make her wonder that he would carry his spouse a person of so much delicacy to a house that if it had not a  bad  fame had not a  good  one  You must think my dear that I liked the pretended Lady Betty the better for this I suppose it was designed I should  He was surprised he said that her Ladyship should hear a bad character of the people It was what he had never before heard that they deserved It was easy indeed to see that they had not very great delicacy tho' they were not indelicate The nature of their livelihood letting lodgings and taking people to board and yet he had understood that they were nice in these particulars led them to aim at being free and obliging And it was difficult he said for persons of chearful disposi∣tions so to behave as to avoid censure Openness of heart and countenance in the Sex more was the pity too often subjected good people whose fortunes did not set them above the world to uncharitable censure  He wished however that her Ladyship would tell  what  she had heard Altho' now it signified but little because he would never ask me to set foot within their doors again And he begged she would not mince the matter  Nay no great matter she said But she had been informed that there were more women lodgers in the house than men Yet that their visitors were more men than women And this had been hinted to her perhaps by illwillers she could not answer for that in such a way as if somewhat further were meant by it than was spoken  This he said was the true innuendo way of characteri∣zing used by detractors Everybody and everything had a black and a white side as illwillers and wellwillers were pleased to report He had observed that the front house was well lett and he believed more to the one sex than to the other for he had seen occasionally passing to and  o several genteel modestlooking women and who it was very probable were not so illbeloved but they might have visitors and relations of both sexes But they were none of them anything to us or we to them We were not once in any of their companies But in the genteelest and most retired house of the two which we had in a manner to ourselves with the use of a parlour to the street to serve us for a servants hall or to receive common visitors or our traders only whom we admitted not upstairs  He always loved to speak as he found No man in  the world had suffered more from calumny than he him∣self had done  Women he owned ought to be more scrupulous than men needed to be where they lodged Nevertheless he wished that fact rather than surmise were to be the foundation of their judgments especially when they spoke of one another  He meant no reflection upon her Ladyship's informants or rather  surmisants  as he might call them be they who they would Nor did he think himself obliged  defend characters impeached or not thought well of by women of virtue and honour Neither were these peo∣ple of importance enough to have so much said abou  them  The pretended Lady Betty said All who knew he  would clear her of censoriousness That it gave  some opinion she must needs say of the people th  he had continued there so long with me that I had r  ¦ther  negative  than  positive  reasons of dislike to them and that so shrewd a man as she heard Capt Tomli  ¦son was had not objected to them  I think niece Charlotte proceeded she as my n  ¦phew has not parted with these lodgings you and I fo  as my dear Miss Harlowe  dislikes  the people I would n  ask  her  for her company will take a dish of tea with m  nephew there before we go out of town and then  shall see what sort of people they are I have hear  that Mrs Sinclair is a mighty forbidding creature  With all my heart Madam In your  Ladyship  's com¦pany I shall make no scruple of going anywhither  It was  Ladyship  at every word and as s  seeme proud of her title and of her dress too I might ha  guessed that she was not used to  either  What say  you  cousin Lovelace Lady Sarah tho' melancholy woman is very inquisitive about all yo  affairs I must acquaint her with every particular  ∣cumstance when I go down  With all his heart He would attend her whene  she pleased She would see very handsome apartmen  and very civil people  The duce is in them said  The  Miss Montague if th  appear other to us  They then fell into familytalk Familyhappiness on my hopefor accession into it They mentioned Lord M's and Lady Sarah's great desire to see me How many friends and admirers with uplift hands I should have  O my dear what a triumph must these creatures and he have over the poor Devoted all the time  What a happy man he would beThey would not  The  Lady Betty said give themselves the mortification but to suppose that I should not be one of Them  Presents were hinted at She resolved that I should go with her to GlenhamHall She would not be refused altho' she were to stay a week beyond her time for me  She long'd for the expected letter from you I must write to hasten it and to let Miss Howe know how every thing stood since I wrote last That might dispose me absolutely in  their  favour and in her nephew's and then she hoped there would be no occasion for me to think of entering upon any new measures  Indeed my dear I did at the time intend if I heard not from you by morning to dispatch a man and horse to you with the particulars of  all  that you might if you thought proper at least put off Mrs Townsend's coming up to another dayBut I was miserably pre∣vented  She made me promise that I would write to you upon this subject whether I heard from you or not One of her servants should ride post with my letter and wait for Miss Howe's answer  She then launched out in deserved praises of you my dear How fond should she be of the honour of your acquaintance  The pretended Miss Montague joined in with her as well for herself as for her sister  Abominably wellinstructed were they both  O my dear What risques may poor giddy girls run when they throw themselves out of the protection of their natural friends and into the wide world  They then talked again of reconciliation and intimacy with every one of my friends with my mother particu∣larly and gave the dear good lady the praises that every one gives her who has the happiness to know her  Ah my dear Miss Howe I had almost forgot my re∣sentments against the pretended nephewSo many agreeable things said made me think that if you should advise it and if I could bring my mind to forgive the wretch for an outrage so  premeditatedly  vile and could forbear despising him for that and his other ingrate∣ful and wicked ways I might not be unhappy in an al∣liance with such a family Yet thought I at the time With what intermixtures does every thing come to me that has the appearance of goodHowever as my lucidhopes made me see fewer faults in the behaviour of these pretended Ladies than recollection and abhorrence have helped me since to see I began to reproach myself that I had not at first thrown myself into their protection  But amidst all these delightful prospects I must not said  The  Lady Betty forget that I am to go to town  She then ordered her coach to be got to the door We will all go to town together said she and return together Morrison shall stay here and see every thing as I used to have it in relation to my apartment and my bed for I am very particular in some respects My cousin Leeson's servants can do all I want to be do  with regard to my nightdresses and the like And i  will be a little airing for you my dear and a good op∣portunity for Mr Lovelace to order what you want of your apparel to be sent from your former lodgings to Mrs Leeson's and we can bring it up with us fro  thence  I had no intention to comply But as I did not ima∣gine that she would insist upon my going to town wit  them I made no answer to that part of her speech  I must here lay down my tired pen  Recollection Heartaffecting Recollection How pains me  LETTER XXI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  IN the midst of these agreeablenesses the coach ca  to the door The pretended Lady Betty besough  me to give them my company to their cousin Leeson  I desired to be excused Yet suspected nothing She would not be denied How happy would a visit so con∣descending make her cousin LeesonHer cousin Leeson was not unworthy of my acquaintance And would take it for the greatest favour in the world  I objected my dress But the objection was not admitted She bespoke a supper of Mrs Moore to be ready at nine  Mr Lovelace vile hypocrite and wicked deceiver see∣ing as he said my dislike to go desired her Ladyship not to insist upon it  Fondness for my company was pleaded She begged me to oblige her Made a motion to help me to my fan herself And in short was so very urgent that my feet complied against my speech and my mind And being in a manner led to the coach by her and made to step in first she followed me and her pretended niece and the wretch followed her And away it drove  Nothing but the height to affectionate complaisance passed all the way Over and over What a joy would this unexpected visit give her cousin Leeson What a pleasure must it be to such a mind as mine to be able to give so much joy to everybody I came near  The cruel the savage seducer as I have since recol∣lected was in rapture all the way but yet such a sort of rapture as he took visible pains to check  Hateful villainHow I abhor him What mischief must be then in his plotting heartWhat a devoted victim must I be in all their eyes  Though not pleased I was nevertheless just then thoughtless of danger they endeavouring thus to lift me up above all apprehension of that and above myself too  But think my dear what a dreadful turn all had upon me when through several streets and ways I knew no∣thing of the coach slackening its pace came within sight of the dreadful house of the dreadfullest woman in the world as she proved to me  Lord be good unto me cry'd the poor fool looking out of the coachMr LovelaceMadam turning to the pretended auntMadam turning to the niece my eyes and hands lifted up Lord be good unto me  What What What my dear  He pulled the stringWhat need to have come this way said heBut since we are I will but ask a questionMy dearest life why this apprehension  The coachman stopp'd His servant who with one of her was behind alightedAsk said he if I have any lettersWho knows my dearest creature turning to me but we may already have one from the Captain We will not go out of the coach Fear nothingWhy so apprehensive Oh these fine spirits cry'd the exe∣crable insulter  Dreadfully did my heart then misgive me I was ready to faintWhy this terror my lifeYou shall not stir out of the coachBut one question now the fellow has drove us this way  Your lady will faint cry'd the execrable Lady Bet∣ty turning to himMy dearest niece I  will  call you taking my hand we must alight if you are so illLet us alightOnly for a glass of water and harts∣hornIndeed we must alight  No no noI am wellQuite wellWon't the ma  drive on I am wellquite wellIndeed I am  Man  drive on putting my head out of the coach  Man  drive on tho' my voice was too low to be heard  The coach stopp'd at the door How I trembled  Dorcas came to the door on its stopping  My dearest creature said the vile man gasping as i  were for breath you shall  not  alightAny letters for me Dorcas  There are two Sir And here is a gentleman Mr Belton Sir waits for your Honour and has done so above an hour  I'll just speak to him Open the doorYou sha'n  t step out my dearA letter perhaps from the Captain alreadyYou sha'n't step out my dear  I sighed as if my heart would burst  But we  must  step out nephew Your lady will faint Maid a glass of hartshorn and waterMy dear yo  must  step outYou will faint childWe must cut you  lacesI believe my complexion was all manner of co∣lours by turnsIndeed you must step out my dear  He knew he said I should be well the moment the coach drove from the door I should  not  alight By his soul I should not  Lord Lord nephew Lord Lord cousin both wo∣men in a breath What ado you make about nothing You  persuade  your lady to be afraid of alightingSee you not that she is just fainting  Indeed Madam said the vile seducer my dearest love must not be moved in this point against her willI beg it may not be insisted upon  Fiddlesaddle foolish manWhat a pother is here I guess how it is You are ashamed to let us see what sort of people you carried your lady amongBut do you go out and speak to your friend and take your letters  He stept out but shut the coachdoor after him to oblige me  The coach may go on Madam said I  The coach  shall  go on my dear life said heBut he gave not nor intended to give orders that it should  Let the coach go on said IMr Lovelace may come after us  Indeed my dear you are illIndeed you must alightAlight but for one quarter of an hourAlight but to give order yourself about your things Whom can you be afraid of in my company and my niece's These people must have behaved shockingly to you Please the Lord I'll inquire into itI'll see what sort of people they are  Immediately came the old creature to the door A thousand pardons dear Madam stepping to the coach∣side if we have anyway offended youBe pleased La∣dies to the other two to alight  Well my dear whispered  the  Lady Betty I now find that an hideous description of a person we never saw is an advantage to them I thought the woman was a mon∣ster But really she seems tolerable  I was afraid I should have fallen into fits But still re∣fused to go outManManMan cry'd I gasping∣ly my head out of the coach and in by turns half a dozen times running drive onLet us go  My heart misgave me beyond the power of my own  accounting for it for still I did not suspect these wo∣men But the antipathy I had taken to the vile house and to find myself so near it when I expected no such matter with the sight of the old creature all together made me behave like a distracted person  The hartshorn and water was brought The pretended lady Betty made me drink it Heaven knows if there were any thing else in it  Besides said she whisperingly I must see what sort of creatures the  nieces  are Want of delicacy cannot be hid from me You could not surely my dear have this aversion to reenter a house for a few minutes in our company in which you lodged and boarded several weeks unless these women could be so presumptuously vile as my nephew ought not to know  Out stept the pretended lady the servant at her command having opened the door  Dearest Madam said the other let me follow you for I was next the door Fear nothing I will not stir from your presence  Come my dear said the pretended Lady Give me your hand holding out hers Oblige me this once  I will bless your footsteps said the old creature if once more you honour my house with your presence  A croud by this time was gathered about us but I was too much affected to mind that  Again the pretended Miss Montague urged me stand∣ing up as ready to go out if I would give her room Lord my dear said she who can bear this croud What will people think  The pretended Lady again pressed me with both her hands held outOnly my dear to give orders about your things  And thus pressed and gazed at for then I looked about me the women so richly dressed people whisper∣ing in an evil moment out stepp'd I trembling forced to lean with both my hands frighted too much for ce∣remony on the pretended Lady Betty's armO that I had dropped down dead upon the guilty threshold  We shall stay but a few minutes my dearbut a few minutes said the same specious jiltout of breath with  her joy as I have since thought that they had thus triumphed over the unhappy victim  Come Mrs Sinclair I think your name is shew us the wayfollowing her and leading me I am very thirsty You have frighted me my dear with your strange fears I must have tea made if it can be done in a moment We have further to go Mrs Sinclair and must return to Hamstead this night  It shall be ready in a moment cry'd the wretch We have water boiling  Hasten thenCome my dear to me as she led me through the passage to the fatal inner houseLean upon meHow you tremblehow you faulter in your steps Dearest niece Lovelace the old wretch being in hear∣ing why these hurries upon your spiritsWe'll begone in a minute  And thus she led the poor sacrifice into the old wretch's too wellknown parlour  Never was anybody so gentle so meek so lowvoiced as the odious woman drawing out in a puling accent all the obliging things she could say Awed I then thought by the conscious dignity of a woman of quality glittering with jewels  The called for tea was ready presently  There was no Mr Belton I believe For the wretch went not to anybody unless it were while we were parlying in the coach No such person however ap∣peared at the teatable  I was made to drink two dishes with milk complai∣santly urged by the pretended Ladies helping me each to one I was stupid to their hands and when I took the tea almost choaked with vapours and could hardly swallow  I thought  transiently  thought that the tea the last dish particularly had an odd taste They on my pa∣lating it observed that the milk was  London milk  far short in goodness of what they were accustomed to from their own dairies  I have no doubt that my two dishes and perhaps my hartshorn were prepared for me in which case it was more proper for their purpose that  they  should help me  than that I should help  myself  Ill before I found my∣self still more and more disordered in my head a heavy torpid pain increasing fast upon me But I imputed it to my terror  Nevertheless at the pretended Ladies motion I went up stairs attended by Dorcas who affected to weep for joy that once more she saw my  blessed  face that was the vile creature's word and immediately I set about taking out some of my cloaths ordering what should be put up and what sent after me  While I was thus employed up came the pretended Lady Betty in a hurrying wayMy dear you won't be long before you are ready My nephew is very busy in writing answers to his letters So I'll just whip away and change my dress and call upon you in an instant  O MadamI  am  ready I am  now  readyYou must not leave me here And down I sunk affrighted into a chair  This instant this instant I will returnBefore you can be readyBefore you can have packed up your thingsWe would not be lateThe robbers we have heard of may be outDon't let us be late  And away she hurried before I could say another word▪ Her pretended niece went with her without taking no∣tice to me of her going  I had no suspicion yet that these women were no  indeed the Ladies they personated and I blamed myself for my weak fearsIt cannot  be  thought I that  such  Ladies will abet treachery against a poor creature they are so fond of They must undoubtedly  be  the persons they  appear  to beWhat folly to doubt it The air the dress the dignity of women of qualityHow un∣worthy of them and of my charity concluded I is this ungenerous shadow of suspicion  So recovering my stupified spirits as well as they could be recovered for I was heavier and heavier and wondered to Dorcas what ailed me rubbing my eyes and taking some of her snuff pinch after pinch to very little purpose I pursued my employment But whe  that was over all packed up that I designed to be packed up and I had nothing to do but to  think  and found  them tarry so long I thought I should have gone dis∣tracted I shut myself into the chamber that had been mine I kneeled I prayed yet knew not what I prayed for Then ran out again It was almost dark night I said Where where was Mr Lovelace  He came to me taking no notice at first of my con∣sternation and wildness What they had given me made me incoherent and wild All goes well said he my dearA line from Captain Tomlinson  All indeed did go well for the villainous project of the most cruel and most villainous of men  I  demanded  his auntI  demanded  his cousinThe evening I said was closingMy head was very  very  bad I remember I saidAnd it grew worse and worse  Terror however as yet kept up my spirits and I insisted upon his going himself to hasten them  He called his servant He raved at the  sex  for  their  delay 'Twas well that business of consequence seldom depended upon such parading unpunctual triflers  His servant came  He ordered him to fly to his cousin Leeson's and to let his aunt and cousins know how uneasy we both were at their delay Adding of his own accord Desire them if they don't come instantly to send their coach and we will go without them Tell them I wonder they'll serve me so  I thought this was considerately and fairly put But now indifferent as my head was I had a little time to consider the man and his behaviour He terrified me with his looks and with his violent emotions as he gazed upon me Evident  joysuppressed  emotions as I have since recollected His sentences short and pro∣nounced as if his breath were touched Never saw I his abominable eyes look as then they lookedTri∣umph in themFierce and wild and more disagree∣able than the womens at the vile house appeared to me when I first saw them And at times such a leering mischiefboding castI would have given the world to have been an hundred miles from him Yet his behaviour was de∣centA decency however that I might have seen to be struggled forFor he snatched my hand two or three  times with a vehemence in his grasp that hurt me speaking words of tenderness through his shut teeth as it seemed and let it go with a beggarvoic'd humble accent like the vile woman's just before halfinward yet his words and manner carrying the appearance of strong and almost convulsed passionO my dear What mischiefs was he not then meditating  I complained once or twice of thirst My mouth seemed parched At the time I supposed that it was my terror gasping often as I did for breath that parched up the roof of my mouth I called for water Some tablebeer was brought me Beer I suppose was a better ve∣hicle if I were not dosed enough before for their po∣tions I told the maid That she knew I seldom tasted maltliquor Yet suspecting nothing of this nature being extremely thirsty I drank it as what came next And in∣stantly as it were found myself much worse than before as if inebriated I should fancy I know not how  His servant was gone twice as long as he needed And just before his return came one of the pretended Lady Betty's with a letter for Mr Lovelace  He sent it up to me I read it And then it was that I thought myself a lost creature it being to put off her going to Hamstead that night on account of violent fits which Miss Montague was pretended to be seized with For then immediately came into my head his vile at∣tempt upon me in this house the revenge that my flight might too probably inspire him with on that occasion and because of the difficulty I made to forgive him and to be reconciled to him his very looks wild and dread∣ful to me and the women of the house such as I had more reason than ever even from the pretended Lady Betty's hints to be afraid of All these crouding together in my apprehensive mind I fell into a kind of phrensy  I have not remembrance how I was for the time it lasted But I know that in my first agitations I pulled off my headdress and tore my ruffles in twenty tatters and ran to find him out  When a little recovered I insisted upon the hint he had given of their coach But the messenger he said had told him that it was sent to fetch a physician lest hi  chariot should be put up or not ready  I then insisted upon going directly to Lady Betty's lodgings  Mrs Leeson's was now a crouded house he said And as my earnestness could be owing to nothing but ground∣less apprehension And O what vows what protestations of his honour did he then make he hoped I would not add to their present concern Charlotte indeed was used to fits he said upon any great surprizes whether of joy or grief and they would told her for a week to∣gether if not got off in a few hours  You are an  observer of eyes  my dear said the villain perhaps in secret insult Saw you not in Miss Montague's nowandthen at Hamstead something wildishI was afraid for her thenSilence and quiet only do her good Your concern for  her  and her love for  you  will but augment the poor girl's disorder if you should go  All impatient with grief and apprehension I still de∣clared myself resolved not to stay in that house till morn∣ing All I had in the world my rings my watch my little money for a coach or if one were not to be got I would go on foot to Hamstead that night tho' I walked it by myself  A coach was hereupon sent for or pretended to be sent for Any price he said he would give to oblige me late as it was and he would attend me with all his soulBuy no coach was to be got  Let me cut short the rest I grew worse and worse in my head now stupid now raving now senseless The vilest of vile women was brought to frighten me Never was there so horrible a creature as she appeared to me at the time  I remember I pleaded for mercyI remember that I said  I would be hisIndeed I would be his  to obtain his mercyBut no mercy found IMy strength my in∣tellects failed meAnd then such scenes followedO my dear such dreadful scenesFits upon fits faintly indeed and imperfectly remembered procuring me no compassionBut death was withheld from me That would have been too great a mercy  THUS was I tricked and deluded back by blacker hearts of my own sex than I thought there were in the world  who appeared to me to be persons of honour And when in his power thus barbarously was I treated by this vil∣lainous man  I was so senseless that I dare not averr that the hor∣rid creatures of the house were personally aiding and abetting But some visionary remembrances I have of fe∣male figures flitting as I may say before my sight the wretched woman's particularly But as these con∣fused ideas might be owing to the terror I had conceived of the worse than masculine violence she had been per∣mitted to assume to me for expressing my abhorrence of her house and as what I suffered from his barbarity wants not that aggravation I will say no more on a sub∣ject so shocking as this must ever be to my remembrance  I never saw the personating wretches afterwards He persisted to the last dreadfully invoking heaven as a wit∣ness to the truth of his assertion that they were really and truly the Ladies they pretended to be declaring that they could not take leave of me when they left the town because of the state of senselesness and phrensy I was in For their intoxicating or rather stupefying potions had almost deleterious effects upon my intel∣lects as I have hinted insomuch that for several days together I was under a strange delirium now moping now dozing now weeping now raving now scribbling tearing what I scribbled as fast as I wrote it  Most  mi∣serable when nowandthen a ray of reason brought con∣fusedly to my remembrance what I had suffered  LETTER XXII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  In Continuation  THE Lady next gives an account  Of her recovery from her phrensical and sleepy dis∣orders  Of her attempt to get away in his absence  Of the conversations that followed at his return be∣tween them  Of the guilty figure he made  Of her resolution not to have him  Of her several efforts to escape  Of her treaty with Dorcas to assist her in it  Of Dorcas's dropping the promisory note undoubtedly as she says on purpose to betray her  Of her triumph over all the creatures of the house assembled to terrify her and perhaps to commit fresh outrages upon her  Of his setting out for M Hall  Of his repeated letters to induce her to meet him at the altar on her uncle's anniversary  Of her determined silence to them all  Of her second escape effected  as she says  contrary to her own expectation That attempt being at first but the intended prelude to a more promising one which she had formed in her mind  And of other particulars which being to be found in Mr Lovelace's preceding letters and that of his friend Belford are omitted She then proceeds  The very hour that I found myself in a place of safety I took pen to write to you When I began I designed only to write six or eight lines to inquire after your health For having heard nothing from you I feared  indeed  that you  had been  and  still were  too ill to write But no sooner did my pen begin to blot the paper but my sad heart hurried it into length The apprehensions I had lain under that I should not be able to get away the fa∣tigue I had in effecting my escape the difficulty of pro∣curing a lodging for myself having disliked the people of two houses and those of a third disliking me for you must think I made a frighted appearanceThese together with the recollection of what I had suffered from him and my farther apprehensions of my insecurity and my desolate circumstances had so disordered me that I remember I rambled strangely in that letter  In short I thought it on reperusal a halfdistracted one But I then despaired were I to begin again of write∣ing better So I let it go And can have no excuse for directing it as I did if the cause of the incoherence in it will not furnish me with a very pitiable one  The letter I received from your mother was a dread∣ful blow to me But nevertheless it had the good effect upon me labouring as I was just then under a violent  sit of vapourish despondency and almost yielding to it which profuse bleeding and blisterings have in paraly∣tical or apoplectical strokes reviving my attention and restoring me to spirits to combat the evils I was surround∣ed bySluicing off and diverting into a new chanel if I may be allowed another metaphor the overcharging woes which threatened once more to overwhelm my in∣tellects  But yet I most sincerely lamented and still lament in your mamma's words  That I cannot be unhappy by myself  And was grieved not only for the trouble I had given you before but for the new one I had brought upon you by my inattention  She then gives the contents of the letters she wrote to Mrs Norton to Lady Betty Lawrence and to Mrs Hodges as also of their answers whereby she detected all Mr Lovelace's impostures  I cannot however says she forbear to wonder how the vile Tomlinson could come at the knowlege of seve∣ral of the things he told me of and which contributed to give me confidence in him  The attentive reader need not be referred back for what th  lady nevertheless could not account for as she knew not that Mr Love∣  ace had come at Miss Howe's letters particularly that in vol iv p  which he comments upon p    I doubt not continues she that the stories of Mrs Fretch∣ville and her house would be found as vile impostures as any of the rest were I to inquire and had I not enough and too much already against the perjured man  How have I been led on says sheWhat will be the end of such a false and perjured creature Heaven not less profaned and defied by him than myself deceived and abused This however against myself I must say That if what I have suffered is the natural consequence of my first error I never can forgive  myself  although you are so partial in my favour as to say that I was not censurable for what passed before my first escape  And now honoured Madam and my dearest Miss Howe who are to sit in judgment upon my case permit me to lay down my pen with one request which with the greatest earnestness I make to you both And that  is That you will neither of you open your lips in rela∣tion to the potions and the violences I have hinted at Not that I am solicitous that my disgrace should be hid∣den from the world or that it should not be generally known that the man has proved a villain to me For this it seems everybody but myself expected from his cha∣racter But suppose as his actions by me are really of a  capital nature  it were insisted upon that I should appear to prosecute him and his accomplices in a Court of Ju∣stice how do you think I could bear That  But since my character  before  the capital enormity was lost in the eye of the world and That from the very hour I left my father's house and since all my own hopes of worldly happiness are intirely over Let me slide quietly into my grave and let it not be remembred ex∣cept by one friendly tear and no more dropt from your gentle eye my own dear Anna Howe on the happy day that shall shut up all my sorrows that there was such a creature as  Saturday July    CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XXIII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Sunday July    MAY heaven signalize its vengeance in the face of all the world upon the most abandoned and profligate of menAnd in its own time I doubt not but it willAnd we must look to a WORLD BEYOND THIS for the reward of your sufferings  Another shocking detection my dearHow have you been deludedVery watchful I have thought you very sagaciousBut alas not watchful not sagacious enough for the horrid villain you have had to deal with  The letter you sent me inclosed as mine of the th of June is a villainous forgery  Vol  V  p    seq  The hand indeed is astonishingly like mine and the cover I see is actually my cover But yet the letter is not so exactly imitated but that had you had any suspicions about his vileness at the time you who so well know my hand might have detected it  In short this vile forged letter tho' a long one con∣tains but a few extracts from mine Mine was a  very  long one He has omitted every thing I see in it that could have shewn you what a detestable house the house is and given you suspicions of the vile TomlinsonYou will see this and how he has turned Miss Lardner's informa∣tion and my advices to you execrable villain to his own horrid ends by the rought draught of the genuine letter which I shall inclose  See Vol  IV  p      Apprehensive for  both  our safeties from such a daring and profligate contriver I must call upon you my dear to resolve upon taking legal vengeance of the infernal wretch And this not only for our own sakes but for the sakes of innocents who otherwise may yet be de∣luded and outraged by him  She then gives the particulars of the report made by the young fellow whom she sent to Hamstead with her letter and who supposed he had delivered it into her own hand  Vol  V  p    and then proceeds  I am astonished that the vile wretch who could know nothing of the time my messenger whose honesty I can vouch for would come could have a creature ready to personate you Strange that the man should happen to arrive just as you were gone to church as I find was the fact on comparing what he says with your hint that you were at church twice that day when he might have got to Mrs Moore's two hours before But had you told me my dear that the villain had found you out and was about youYou should have done thatYet I blame you upon a judgment founded on the  event  only  I never had any faith in the stories that go current among country girls of spectres familiars and demons yet I see not any other way to account for this wretch's successful villainy and for his means of workingup his specious delusions but by supposing if he be not the devil himself that he has a familiar constantly at his elbow Sometimes it seems to me that this familiar assumes the shape of that solemn villain Tomlinson  Sometimes that of the execrable Sinclair as he calls her Sometimes it is permitted to take that of Lady Betty LawrenceBut when it would assume the angelic shape and mien of my beloved friend see what a bloated figure it made  'Tis my opinion my dear that you will be no longer safe where you are than while the V is in the country Words are pooror how could I execrate him I have hardly any doubt that he has sold himself for a time O may the time be shortOr may his infernal prompter no more keep covenant with him than he does with others  I inclose not only the rough draught of my long letter mentioned above but the heads of that which the young fellow thought he delivered into your own hands at Ham∣stead And when you have perused them I will leave you to judge how much reason I had to be surprised that you wrote me not an answer to either of those lettes one of which you owned you had received tho' it proved to be is forged one the other delivered into your own hands as I was assured and both of them of so much concern to your honour and still how much more sur∣prised I must be when I received a letter from Mrs Townsend dated June from Hamstead importing  That Mr Lovelace who had been with you several days had on the Monday before brought his aunt and cousin richly dressed and in a coach and four to visit you Who with your own consent had carried you to town with themto your former lodgings where you still were That the Hamstead women be∣lieved you to be married and reflected upon me as a fomenter of differences between man and wife That he himself was at Hamstead the day before viz Wedn the th and boasted of his happiness with you in∣viting Mrs Moore Mrs Bevis and Miss Rawlins to go to town to visit his spouse which they promised to do That he declared that you were intirely recon∣ciled to your former lodgingsAnd that finally the women at Hamstead told Mrs Townsend that he had very handsomely discharged theirs  I own to you my dear that I was so much surprised  and disgusted at these appearances against a conduct till then unexceptionable that I was resolved to make myself as easy as I could and wait till you should think fit to write to me But I could reinin my impatience but for a few days and on the th of June I wrote a sharp letter to you which I find you did not receive  What a fatality my dear has appeared in your case from the very beginning till this hour Had my mother permitted  But can I blame  her  when you have a  father  and  mother  living who have so much to answer forSo much as no father and mother considering the child they have driven persecuted exposed renouncedever had to an∣swer for  But again I must execrate the abandoned villainYet as I said before  all  words are poor and beneath the oc∣casion  But see we not in the horrid perjuries and treachery of this man what rakes and libertines will do when they get a young creature into their power It is pro∣bable that he might have the intolerable presumption to hope an easier conquest But when your unexampled vigilance and exalted virtue made potions and rapes and the utmost violences necessary to the attainment of his detestable end we see that he never boggled at them I have no doubt that the same or equal wickedness would be  oftener  committed by men of this villainous cast if the folly and credulity of the poor inconsiderates who throw themselves into their hands did not give them an easier triumph  With what comfort must those parents reflect upon these things who have happily disposed of their daugh∣ters in marriage to a virtuous man And how happy the young women who find themselves safe in a worthy protectionIf such a person as Miss Clarissa Harlowe could not escape who can be secureSince tho' every rake is not a LOVELACE neither is every woman a CLARISSA And his attempts were but proportioned to your resistance and vigilance  My mother has commanded me to let you know her thoughts upon the whole of your sad story I will do  it in another letter and send it to you with this by a special messenger  But for the future if you approve of it I will send my letters by the usual hand Collins's to be left at the Saracen's head on Snowhill Whither you may send yours as we both used to do to Wilson's except such as we shall think fit to transmit by the post Which I am afraid after my next must be directed to Mr Hickman as before Since my mother is for fixing a condition to our correspondence which I doubt you will not com∣ply with tho' I wish you would This condition I shall acquaint you with byandby  Mean time begging excuse for all the harsh things in my last I beseech you my dearest creature to believe me to be  Your truly sympathizing and unalterable Friend  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXIV Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday July    I NOW my dearest friend resume my pen to obey my mother in giving you her opinion upon your unhappy story  She still harps upon the old string and will have it that all your calamities are owing to your first fatal step for she believes what I cannot that your relations had intended after one general trial more to comply with your aversion if they had found it as rivetted a one as let me say it was a folly to suppose it would not be found to be after so many  ridiculously  repeated experiments  As to your latter sufferings from that vilest of mis∣creants she is unalterably of opinion that if all be as you have related which she doubts not with regard to the potions and to the violences you have sustained you ought by all means to set on foot a prosecution against him and his devilish accomplices  She asks What murderers what ravishers would be  brought to justice if  modesty  were to be a general plea and allowable against appearing in a court to prosecute  She says that the good of society requires that such a beast of prey should be hunted out of it And if you do not prosecute him she thinks you will be answerable for all the mischiefs he may do in the course of his future villainous life  Will it be thought Nancy said she that Miss Harlowe can be in earnest when she says she is not solicitous to have her disgraces concealed from the world if she is afraid or ashamed to appear in court to do justice to herself and her sex against him Will it not be rather surmised that she may be apprehensive that some weak∣ness or lurking love will appear upon the trial of the strange cause If inferred she such complicated villainy as this where perjury potions forgery subornation are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent crea∣ture and to dishonour a family of eminence and where those very crimes as may be supposed are proofs of her innocence is to go off impunely what case will deserve to be brought into judgment or what malefactor ought to be hanged  Then she thinks and so do I that the vile creatures his accomplices ought by all means to be brought to condign punishment as they must and will be upon bring∣ing him to his tryal And this may be a means to blow up and root out a whole nest of vipers and save many innocent creatures  She added That if Miss Clarissa Harlowe could be so indifferent about having this public justice done upon such a wretch for her  own  sake she ought to overcome her scruples out of regard to her family her acquaintance and her sex which are all highly injured and scandalized by his villainy to her  For her own part she declares That were  she  your mother she would forgive you upon no other terms And upon your compliance with these she herself will undertake to reconcile all your family to you  These my dear are my mother's sentiments upon your sad story  I cannot say but there are reason and justice in them And it is my opinion that it would be very right for the Law to  oblige  an injured woman to prosecute and to make seduction on the man's part capital where his studied baseness and no fault in her will appeared  To this purpose the custom in the Isle of Man is a very good one  If a single woman there prosecutes a single man for a rape the ecclesiastical judges impanel a jury and if this jury finds him guilty he is returned  guilty  to the temporal courts Where if he be convicted the deemster or judge delivers to the woman a Rope a Sword and a Ring and she has it in her choice to have him hanged beheaded or to marry him  One of the two former I think should always be her option  I long for the full particulars of your story You must have but too much time upon your hands for a mind so active as yours if tolerable health and spirits be afforded you  The villainy of the worst of men and the virtue of the most excellent of women I expect will be exemplified in it were it to be written in the same connected and particular manner that you used to write to me in  Try for it my dearest friend and since you cannot give the  example  without the  warning  give  both  for the sakes of all those who shall hear of your unhappy fate beginning from yours of June your prospects then not disagreeable I pity you for the task tho' I cannot willingly exempt you from it  MY mother will have me add That she must  insist  upon your prosecuting She repeats that she makes that a condition on which she permits our future correspond∣ence▪So let me know your thoughts upon it I asked her If she would be willing that I should appear to sup∣port you in court if you compliedBy all means she said if that would induce you to begin with him and with the horrid women I think I could attend you▪ I am sure I could were there but a probability of bring∣ing the monster to his deserved end  Once more your thoughts of it supposing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations  But whatever be your determination on this head it shall be my constant prayer That God will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions as a person ought to do whose faulty will has not brought them upon herself that He will speak peace and comfort to your wounded mind and give you many happy years  I am and ever will be  Your affectionate and faithful  ANNA HOWE  The two preceding letters were sent by a special messenger In the cover were written the following lines  Monday July    I CANNOT my dearest friend suffer the inclosed to go unaccompanied by a few lines to signify to you that they are both less tender in some places than I would have written had they not been to pass my mamma's inspection The principal reason however of my writing thus separately is To beg of you to permit me to send you money and necessaries which you must needs want And that you will let me know if either I or  anybody I can influence  can be of service to you I am excessively apprehensive that you are not enough out of his reach where you are Yet London I am persuaded is the place of all others to be private in  I could tear my hair for vexation that I have it not in my power to afford you  personal  protectionI am  Your everdevoted  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Tuesday July    I APPROVE my dearest friend of the method you prescribe for the conveyance of our letters and have already caused the porter of the inn to be engaged to  bring to me yours the moment that Collins arrives with them As the servant of the house where I am will be permitted to carry mine to Collins for you  As you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before you I will if life and spirits be lent me give you an ample account of all that has befallen me from the time you mention But this it is very probable you will not see till after the close of my last scene And as I shall write with a view to that I hope no other voucher will be wanted for the veracity of the writer  I am far from thinking myself out of the reach of this man's further violence But what can I do Whither can I flyPerhaps my bad state of health which must grow worse as recollection of the past evils and re∣flections upon them grow heavier and heavier upon me may be my protection Once indeed I thought of going abroad and had I the prospect of many years before me I would goBut my dear the blow is given Nor have you reason now circumstanced as I am to be concerned that it is What a heart must I have if it be not brokenAnd indeed my  dear  my  best  I had almost said my  only  friend I do so earnestly wish for the last closing scene and with so much comfort find myself in a declining way that I even sometimes ingratefully regret that naturally healthy constitution which used to double upon me all my enjoyments  As to the earnestly recommended prosecution I may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter if ever I shall have better spirits for they are at present extremely sunk and lowBut just now will only say that I would sooner suffer every evil the repetition of the capital one excepted than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice  Dr Lewin as will be seen hereafter presses her to this public prosecution by arguments worthy of his character Which she answers in a manner worthy of hers  And I am heartily grieved that your mother prescribes such a measure as the condition of our future correspondenceFor the continuance of your friend∣ship my dear and the desire I had to correspond with you to my life's end were all my remaining hopes and  consolation Nevertheless as that friendship is in the power of the  heart  not of the  hand  only I hope I shall not forfeit that  O my dear what weight has a parent's curseYou cannot imagineBut I will not touch this string to you who never loved themA reconciliation with them is not be hoped for  I have written a letter to Miss Rawlins of Hamstead the answer to which just now received has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance by which this wicked man got your letter of June the th I will give you the contents of both  In mine to her I briefly acquaint her  with what had befallen me thro' the vileness of the women who had been passed upon me as the aunt and cousin of the wickedest of men and own that I never was married to him I desire her to make particular in∣quiry and to let me know who it was at Mrs Moore's that on Sunday afternoon June while I was at church received a letter from Miss Howe pretending to be me and lying on a couchWhich letter had it come to my hands would have saved me from ruin I excuse myself from the delirium which the bar∣barous usage I had received threw me into and from a confinement as barbarous and illegal that I had not before applied to Mrs Moore for an account of what I was indebted to her Which I now desired And for sear of being traced by Mr Lovelace I directed her to superscribe her answer To Mrs Mary Atkins▪ to be left till called for at the BellSavage Inn o  LudgateHill  In her answer she tells me  that the vile wretc  prevailed upon Mrs Bevis to personate me A sudde  motion of his it seems on the appearance of you  messengerpersuaded to lie along on a couch  handkerchief over her neck and face pretending  be ill drawn in by false notions of your ill office to keep up a variance between a man and his wife and so taking the letter from your messenger as me  Miss Rawlins takes pains to excuse Mrs Bevis's i  ¦tention She expresses their astonishment and conc  at what I communicate But is glad however and so they are all that they know in time the vileness of the base man the two widows and herself having at his earnest invitation designed me a visit at Mrs Sinclair's supposing all to be happy between him and me as he assured them was the case Mr Lovelace she informs me had handsomely satisfied Mrs Moore And Miss Rawlins concludes with wishing to be fa∣voured with the particulars of so extraordinary a story as they may be of use to let her see what wicked creatures women as well as men there are in the world  I thank you for the draughts of your two letters which were intercepted by this horrid man I see the great ad∣vantage they were of to him in the prosecution of his villainous designs against the poor wretch whom he has so long made the sport of his abhorred inventions  Let me repeat that I am quite sick of life and of an earth in which  innocent  and  benevolent  spirits are sure to be considered as  aliens  and to be made sufferers by the  genuine sons  and  daughters  of  that earth  How unhappy that those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views and armed me against them and against the vileness of the base women should fall into his handsUnhappier still in that my very escape to Hamstead gave him the opportunity of receiving them  Nevertheless I cannot but still wonder how it was possible for that Tomlinson to know what passed between Mr Hickman and my uncle Harlowe  See the note at the bottom of p    A circumstance which gave that vile impostor most of his credit with me  How the wicked wretch himself could find me out at Hamstead must also remain wholly a mystery to me He  may  glory in his contrivancesHe who has more wick∣edness than wit  may  glory in his contrivancesBut after all I shall I humbly presume to hope be happy when he poor wretch will beAlaswho can say what  Adieu my dearest friendMay  you  be happyAnd then your Clarissa Harlowe cannot be wholly miserable  LETTER XXVI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Wedn Night July    I WRITE my dearest creature I cannot  but  write to express my concern on your dejection Let me beseech you my charming excellence let me beseech you not to give way to it  Comfort yourself on the contrary in the triumphs of a virtue unsullied a will wholly faultless Who could have withstood the trials that you have surmountedYour cousin Morden will soon come He will see justice done you I make no doubt as well with regard to what concerns your person as your estate And many happy days may you yet see and much good may you still do if you will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty de∣spondency  But why my dear this pining solicitude continued after a reconciliation with relations as unworthy as im∣placable whose wills are governed by an allgrasping brother who finds his account in keeping the breach open On this oversolicitude it is now plain to me that the vilest of men built all his schemes He saw you had a thirst after it beyond all reason for hope The view the hope I own extremely desirable had your family been Christians or even had they been Pagans who had bowels  I shall send this short letter I am obliged to make it a short one by young Rogers as we call him the fellow I sent to you to Hamstead an innocent tho' pragma∣tical rustic Admit him I pray you into your presence that he may report to me how you look and how you are  Mr Hickman should attend you but I apprehend that all his motions and my own too are watched by the execrable wretch As indeed his are by an agent of mine for I own that I am so apprehensive of his plots and revenge now I know that he has intercepted my vehement letters against him that he is the subject of my dreams as well as of my waking fears  MY mother at my earnest importunity has just given me leave to write and to receive your lettersBut fastened this condition upon the concession that yours must be under cover to Mr Hickman this with a view I suppose to give him consideration with me and upon this further condition that she is to see all we write  When girls are set upon a point  she told one who told me again  it is better for a mother if possible to make herself of their party rather than to oppose them since there will be then hopes that she will still hold the reins in her own hands  Pray let me know what the people are with whom you lodgeShall I send Mrs Townsend to direct you to lodgings either more safe or more convenient for you  Be pleased to write to me by Rogers who will wait on you for your answer at your own time  Adieu my dearest creature Comfort  yourself  as you would in the like unhappy circumstances comfort  Your own  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXVII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Thursday July    I AM extremely concerned my dear Miss Howe for being primarily the occasion of the apprehensions you have of this wicked man's vindictive attempts What a wide spreading error is mine  If I find that he sets on foot any machination against you or Mr Hickman I do assure you I will consent to prosecute him altho' I were sure I should not survive my first appearance at the Bar he should be arraigned at  I own the justice of your mother's arguments on that subject but must say that I think there are circumstances in my particular case which will excuse me altho' on a slighter occasion than  that  above apprehended I should decline to appear against him I have said that I may one day enter more particularly into this subject  Your messenger has now indeed seen me I talked with him on the imposture put upon him at Hamstead And am sorry to have reason to say that had not the poor young man been very  simple  and very  selfsufficient  he had not been so grosly deluded Mrs Bevis has the same plea to make for herself A goodnatured thought∣less woman not used to converse with so vile and so specious a deceiver as him who made his advantage of both these shallow creatures  I think I cannot be more private than where I am I hope I am safe All the risque I run is in going out and returning from morning prayers which I have two or three times ventured to do once at LincolnsInn chapel at eleven once at St Dunstan's Fleetstreet at seven in the morning in a chair both times and twice at six in the morning at the neighbouring church in Coventgarden The wicked wretches I have escaped from will not I hope come to church to look for me especially at so early prayers and I have fixed upon the privatest pew in the latter church to hide myself in and perhaps I may lay out a little matter in an ordinary gown by way of disguise my face half hid by my mobI am very careless my dear of my appearance now Neat and clean takes up the whole of my at∣tention  The man's name at whose house I lodge is Smith A glove  maker  as well as  seller  His wife is the shopkeeper A dealer also in stockens ribbands snuff and perfumes A matronlike woman plainhearted and prudent The husband an honest industrious man And they live in good understanding with each other A proof with me that their hearts are right for where a married couple live together upon ill terms it is a sign I think that each knows something amiss of the other either with regard to temper or morals which if the world knew as well as themselves it would as little like them as such people like each other Happy the marriage where neither man nor wife has any wilful or premedi∣tated evil in their general conduct to reproach the other withFor even persons who have bad hearts will have a veneration for those who have good ones  Two neat rooms with plain but clean furniture on the first floor are mine one they call the diningroom  There is up another pair of stairs a very worthy widowlodger Mrs Lovick by name who altho' of low fortunes is much respected as Mrs Smith assures me by people of condition of her acquaintance for her piety prudence and understanding With her I propose to be well acquainted  I thank you my dear for your kind you seasonable advice and consolation I hope I shall have more grace given me than to despond in the  religious  sense of the word Especially as I can apply to myself the comfort you give me that neither my will nor my inconsider∣ateness has contributed to my calamity But never∣theless the irreconcileableness of my relations whom I love with an unabated reverence my apprehensions of fresh violences This wicked man I doubt will not yet let me rest my destituteness of protection my youth my sex my unacquaintedness with the world subjecting me to insults my reflections on the scandal I have given added to the sense of the indignities I have received from a man of whom I deserved not ill all together will undoubtedly bring on the effect that cannot be un∣desirable to meThe slower however perhaps from my natural good ocnstitution and as I presume to ima∣gine from principles which I hope will in due time and by due reflection set me  above the sense of all worldly disappointments  At present my head is much disordered I have not indeed enjoyed it with any degree of clearness since the violence done to that and to my heart too by the wicked arts of the abandoned creatures I was cast among  I must have more conflicts At times I find my self not subdued enough to my condition I will welcome those conflicts as they come as  probationary  onesBut yet my father's maledictionYet I hope even that may be made of so much use to me as to cause me to  double my attention to render it ineffectual  All I will at present add are my thanks to your mo∣ther for her indulgence to us Due compliments to Mr Hickman and my request that you will believe me to  be to my last hour and beyond it if possible my be∣loved friend and my  dearer  Self for what is now my Self  Your obliged and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XXVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday July    I HAVE three of thy letters at once before me to answer in each of which thou complainest of my silence and in one of them tellest me that thou canst not live unless I scribble to thee every day or every other day at least  Why then die Jack if thou wilt What heart thinkest thou can I have to write when I have lost the only subject worth writing upon  Help me again to my Angel to my CLARISSA and thou shalt have a letter from me or writing at least part of a letter every hour All that the charmer of my heart shall say that will I put down Every motion every air of her beloved person every look will I try to de∣scribe and when she is silent I will endeavour to tell thee her thoughts either what they are or what I'd have them to beSo that having  her  I shall never want a subject Having lost her my whole soul is a blank The whole creation round me the elements above beneath and every thing I  behold  for nothing can I  enjoy  is a blank without her  O Return Return thou dear charmer of my soul Return to thy adoring Lovelace What is the light what the air what the town what the country what's anything without thee Light air joy harmony in my notion are but parts of thee and could they be all ex∣pressed in one word that word would be CLARISSA  O my beloved CLARISSA Return thou then once more Return to bless thy LOVELACE who now by the loss of thee knows the value of the jewel he has slighted  and rises every morning but to curse the sun that shines upon everybody but him  WELL but Jack 'tis a surprising thing to me that the dear fugitive cannot be met with cannot be heard of She is so poor a plotter for plotting is not her talent that I am confident had I been at liberty I should have found her out before now altho' the different emissaries I have employed about town round the adjacent villages and in Miss Howe's vicinage have hitherto failed of success But my Lord continues so weak and lowspirited that there is no getting from him I would not disoblige a man whom I think in danger still For would his gout now it has got him down but give him like a fair boxer the risingblow all would be over with him And here pox of his fondness for me it happens at a very bad time he makes me sit hours together entertaining him with my rog  eries a pretty amusement for a sick man And yet whenever he has the gout he prays night and morning with his chaplain But what must  his  notions of religion be who after he has nosed and mumbled over his responses can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction as if he thought he had made up with heaven and return with a new appetite to my storiesEncouraging them by shaking his sides with laughing at them and calling me a sad fellow in such an accent as shews he takes no small delight in his kinsman  The old Peer has been a sinner in his day and suffers for it now A sneaking sinner  sliding  rather than  rush∣ing  into vices for fear of his reputation Or rather for fear of detection and positive proof for these sort of fellows Jack have no real regard for reputation Paying for what he never had and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprize at first hand which could bring him within view of a tilting or of the honour of being considered as the principal man in a court of justice  To see such an old Trojan as this just dropping into the grave which I hoped ere this would have been dug and filled up with him crying out with pain and grunt∣ing with weakness yet in the same moment crack his  leathern face into an horrible laugh and call a young sinner charming varlet encoreing him as formerly he used to do the Italian eunuchs what a preposterous what an unnatural adherence to old habits  My two cousins are generally present when I  entertain  as the old peer calls it Those stories must drag horribly that have not more hearers and applauders than relaters  Applauders  Ay Belford  Applauders  repeat I for altho' these girls pretend to blame me sometimes for the  facts  they praise my manner my invention my intrepidityBe∣sides what other people call  blame  that call I  praise  I ever did and so I very early discharged  shame  that cold∣water damper to an enterprising spirit  These are smart girls they have life and wit and yesterday upon Charlotte's raving against me upon a related enterprize I told her that I had had it in debate several times whether she were or were not too near of kin to me And that it was once a moot point with me whether I could not love her dearly for a month▪ or so And perhaps it was well for her that another pretty little puss started up and diverted me just as I was entering upon the course  They all three held up their hands and eyes at once But I observed that tho' the girls exclaimed against me they were not so angry at this plain speaking as I have found my beloved upon hints so dark that I have won∣dered at her quick apprehension  I told Charlotte That grave as she pretended to be in her  smiling  resentments on this declaration I was sure I should not have been put to the expence of above two or three stratagems for nobody admired a good inven∣tion more than she could I but have disentangled her conscience from the embarasses of consanguinity  She pretended to be highly displeased So did her sister for her I told her that she seemed as much in earnest as if she had thought  me  so and  dared  the trial Plain words I said in these cases were more shocking to their sex than gradatim actions And I bid Patty not be displeased at my distinguishing her sister since I had a great respect for  her  likewise  An Italian air in my usual careless way a halfstruggled for kiss from me and a shrug of the shoulder by way of admiration from each pretty cousin and Sad sad fellow from the old Peer attended with a sideshaking laugh made us all friends  There JackWilt thou or wilt thou not take this for a letter There's Quantity I am sureHow have I fill'd a sheet not a shorthand one indeed without a sub∣ject My fellow shall take this for he is going to town And if thou canst think tolerably of such execrable stuff I will soon send thee another  LETTER XXIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Six Sat morning July    HAVE I nothing new nothing diverting in my whimsical way thou askest in one of thy three letters before me to entertain thee withAnd thou tellest me that when I have least to  narrate  to speak in the Scotish phrase I am most diverting A pretty compli∣ment either to thyself or to me To both indeedA sign that thou hast as frothy a heart as I a head But canst thou suppose that this admirable woman is not All is not Everything with me Yet I dread to think of her too for detection of all my contrivances I doubt must come next  The old Peer is also full of Miss Harlowe and so are my cousins He hopes I will not be such a dog There's a specimen of his peerlike dialect as to think of doing dishonourably by a woman of so much merit beauty and fortune and he says of so good a family But I tell him that this is a string he must not touch That it is a very tender point In short is my sore place and that I am afraid he would handle it too roughly were I to put myself into the power of so ungentle an operator  He shakes his crazy head He thinks all is not as it should be between us longs to have me present her to him as my wife and often tells me what great things he will do additional to his former proposals and what presents he will make on the birth of the first child  But I hope the whole will be in my hands before such an event take place No harm in  hoping  Jack My uncle says  Were it not for hope the heart would break  EIGHT o'clock at Midsummer and these lazy varletesses in full health not come down yet to breakfastWhat a confounded indecency in young Ladies to let a Rake know that they love their beds so dearly and at the same time  where to have them  But I'll punish them They shall breakfast with their old uncle and yawn at one an∣other as if for a wager While I drive my Phaeton to Col Ambrose's who yesterday gave me invitation both to breakfast and dine on account of two Yorkshire nieces celebrated toasts who have been with him this fortnight past and who he says want to see  me  So Jack all women do not run away from me thank Hea∣ven I wish I could have leave of my heart since the dear fugitive is so ingrateful to drive her out of it with another Beauty But who can supplant her Who can be admitted to a place in it after Miss Clarissa Harlowe  At my return if I can find a subject I will scribble on to oblige thee  My Phaeton's ready My cousins send me word they are just coming down So in spite I'll be gone  Saturday afternoon  I DID stay to dine with the Colonel and his Lady and Nieces But I could not pass the afternoon with them for the heart of me There was enough in the persons and faces of the two young ladies to set me upon comparisons Particular features held my attention for a few moments But those served but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my soul who for person for air for mind had never any equal My heart recoil'd and sicken'd upon comparing minds and conversation Pert wit a too studiedfor desire to please each in high good hu∣mour with herself an openmouth affectation in both to shew white teeth as if the principal excellence and to invite amorous familiarity by the promise of a sweet breath at the same time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be less pure  Once I could have borne them  They seemed to be disappointed that I was so soon able to leave them Yet have I not at present so much vanity My Clarissa has cured me of my vanity as to at∣tribute their disappointment so much to particular liking of me as to their own selfadmiration They looked upon me as a connoisseur in beauty They would have been proud of engaging my attention as such But so affected so flimsywitted mere skindeep beauties They had looked no further into themselves than what their glasses had enabled them to see And their glasses were flatteringglasses too for I thought them passivefaced and spiritless with eyes however upon the hunt for conquests and bespeaking the attention of others in order to countenance their ownI believe I could with a little pains have given them life and soul and to every feature of their faces sparkling information But my ClarissaO Belford my Clarissa has made me eyeless and senseless to every other Beauty Do thou find her for me as a subject worthy of my pen or This shall be the last from  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER XXX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday night July    NOW Jack have I a subject with a vengeance I am in the very height of my tryal for all my sins to my beloved fugitive For here yesterday at about five o'clock arrived Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Law∣rance each in her chariot and six Dowagers love equi∣page and these cannot travel ten miles without a set and half a dozen horsemen  My time had hung heavy upon my hands and so I went to church after dinner Why may not handsome fellows thought I like to be look'd at as well as hand∣some wenchesI fell in when Service was over with Major Warneton and so came not home till after six and was surprised at entering the courtyard here to find it litter'd with equipages and servants I was sure the owners of them came for no good to me  Lady Sarah I soon found was raised to this visit by Lady Betty who has health enough to allow her to look out of herself and out of her own affairs for business Yet congratulation to my uncle on his amendment Spite∣ful devils on both accounts was the avowed errand But coming in my absence I was their principal subject and they had opportunity to set each other's heart against me  Simon Parsons hinted this to me as I passed by the Steward's office for it seems they talked loud and he was making up some accounts with old Pritchard  However I hasten'd to pay my duty to them Other people not performing theirs is not excuse for the neglect of our own you know  And now I enter upon my TRYAL  WITH horrible grave faces was I received The two antiques only bowed their tabby heads making longer faces than ordinary and all the old lines appear∣ing strong in their furrow'd foreheads and fallen cheeks How do you cousin and How do you Mr Lovelace looking all round at one another as who should say Do you speak first and Do you For they seemed resolved to lose no time  I had nothing for it but an air as manly as theirs was womanly Your servant Madam to Lady Betty and Your servant MadamI am glad to see you abroad  Lady Sarah  I took my seat Lord M look'd horribly glum hi  fingers clasped and turning round and round under and over his but just disgouted thumbs his sallow face and goggling eyes cast upon the floor on the fireplace on hi  two sisters on his two kinswomen by turns but no  once deigning to look upon me  Then I began to think of the Laudanum and wet cloth I had told thee of long ago and to call myself in questio  for a tenderness of heart that will never do me good  At last Mr LovelaceCousin LovelaceHem HemI am sorry very sorry hesitated Lady Sara  that thee is no hope of your ever taking up  What's the matter  now  Madam  The matter nowWhy Lady Betty has two letters from Miss Harlowe which have  told  us what's the matter Are all women alike with you  Yes I could have answered 'bating the difference which pride makes  Then they all chorus'd upon meSuch a character as Miss Harlowe's cry'd oneA lady of so much generosity and good sense anotherHow charmingly she writes the two maiden monkies looking at her fine handwriting Her perfections my crimes What can you expect will be the end of these things cried Lady Sarah Damn'd damn'd doings vociferated the Peer shaking his looseflesh'd wabbling chaps which hung on his shoulders like an old cow's dewlap  For my part I hardly knew whether to sing or say what I had to reply to these allatonce attacks upon me Fair and softly Ladies One at a time I beseech you I am not to be hunted down without being heard I hope Pray let me see these letters I beg you will let me see them  There they areThat's the firstRead it out if you can  I open'd a letter from my charmer date  Thursday June  our weddingday that was to be and written to Lady Betty LawranceBy the contents to my great joy I find the dear creature is alive and well and in charming spirits But the direction where to send an answer was so scratched out that I could not read it which afflicted me much  She puts three questions in it to Lady Betty  st About a letter of hers date  June  congratulating our nuptials and which I was so good as to save my aunt the trouble of writing A very civil thing of me I think  Again  Whether she and one of her nieces Mon∣tague were to go to town on an old Chancerysuit  And  Whether they actually did go to town accord∣ingly and to Hamstead afterwards  and  Whether they brought to town from thence the young creature whom they visited  was the subject of the second and third questions  A little inquisitive dear rogue And what did she ex∣pect to be the better for these questionsBut curiosity damn'd curiosity is the itch of the SexYet when didst thou know it turn'd to their benefitFor they seldom in∣quire but when they fearAnd the proverb as my Lord has it says  It comes with a fear  That is I suppose what they fear generally happens because there is generally occasion for the fear  Curiosity indeed she avows to be her only motive for these interrogatories For tho' she says her Ladyship may suppose the questions are not asked for good to  me  yet the answer can do me no harm nor her good only to give her to understand whether I have told hera parcel of damn'd lyes that's the plain English of her inquiry  Well Madam said I with as much philosophy as I could assume and may I ask pray What was your Ladyship's answer  There's a copy of it tossing it to me very disrespect∣fully  This answer was dated  July  A very kind and complaisant one to the lady but very soso to her poor kinsman That people can give up their own flesh and blood with so much easeShe tells her  how proud all our family would be of an alliance with such an ex∣cellence  She does me justice in saying how much I adore her as an angel of a lady and begs of her for I know not how many sakes besides my soul's sake  that she will be so good as to have me for an husband And answersthou wilt guess howto the lady's que∣stions  Well Madam and pray may I be favour'd with the lady's other letter I presume it is in reply to yours  It is said the Peer But Sir let me ask you a few questions before you read itGive  me  the letter Lady Betty  There it is my Lord  Then on went the spectacles and his head moved to the linesA charming pretty handI have often heard that this lady is a  genus  And so Jack repeating my Lord's wise comments and questions will let thee into the contents of this merciless letter  Monday July    reads my LordLet me see That was last  Monday  no longer ago  Monday July the third▪  MadamI cannot excuse myselfum um um um um um humming inarticulately and skipping  I must own to you Madam that the honour of being related  Off went the spectaclesNow tell me Sir Has not this Lady lost all the friends she had in the world for your sake  She has very implacable friends my Lord We all know That  But has she not lost all for your sakeTell me That  I believe so my Lord  Well thenI am glad thou art not so graceless as to deny That  On went the spectacles again  I must own to you Madam that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent    Very pretty truly  said my Lord repeating  as eminent for their virtue as for their descent  was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to Mr Lovelace's address  There is dignity born dignity in this Lady cry'd my Lord  Lady Sarah  She would have been a grace to our family  Lady Betty  Indeed she would  Lovel  To a royal family I will venture to say  Ld M  They what a devil  Lovel  Please to read on my Lord It cannot be  her  letter if it does not make you admire her more and more as you read Cousin Charlotte Cousin Patty pray at∣tend Read on my Lord  Miss Charlotte  Amazing fortitude  Miss Patty only lifted up her dove's eyes  Lord M  reading  And the rather as I was deter∣mined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion  Then again they chorus'd upon me  A blessed time of it poor II had nothing for it but impudence  Lovel  Pray read on my LordI told you how you would all admire herOr shall I read  Lord M  Damn'd assurance  reading  I had another motive which I knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family    They were all ear    A presumptuous one a punishably presumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that I might be an humble means in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man who had as I thought good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed or at least gratitude enough to acknow∣lege the intended obligation whether the generous hope were to succeed or not  Excellent young creature  Excellent young creature echoed the ladies with their handkerchiefs at their eyes attended with nosemusic  Lovel  By my soul Miss Patty you weep in the wrong place You shall never go with me to a tragedy  Lady Betty  Harden'd wretch  His Lordship had pulled off his spectacles to wipe them His eyes were misty and he thought the fault in his spectacles  I saw they were all cock'd and prim'dTo be sure that is a very pretty sentence said I That is the excellency of this lady that in every line as she writes on she im∣proves upon herself Pray my Lord proceedI know her style the next sentence will still rise upon us  Lord M  Damn'd fellow  again saddling and reading  But I have been most egregiously mistaken in Mr Love∣lace    Then they all clamour'd again  The  only  man I persuade myself  Lovel  Ladies may persuade themselves to any thing But how can she answer for what  other  men would or would not have done in the same circumstances  I was forced to say anything to stifle their outcries  o  take ye all together thought I as if I had not vexatio  enough in losing her  Lord M  reading  The only man I persuade my∣self pretending to be a gentleman in whom I coul  have been so much mistaken  They were all beginning againPray my Lord pr  ∣ceedHear hearPray Ladies hearNow my Lord be pleased to proceed The Ladies are silent  So they were lost in admiration of me hands and eyes uplifted  Lord M  I will to thy confusion for he had look'd over the next sentence  What wretches Belsord what spiteful wretches are poor mortalsSo rejoiced to sting one another to see each other stung  Lord M  reading  For while I was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch I have been not acciden∣tally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him  What say you to this Sirr  Lady S Lady B  Ay Sir what say you to this  Lovel  Say Why I say it is a very pretty metaphor if it would but holdBut if you please my Lord read on Let me hear what is further said and I will speak to it all together  Lord M  I will  And he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruin'd a name that I will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own  They all looked at me as expecting me to speak  Lovel  Be pleased to proceed my Lord I will speak to this byandby How came she to know I  kept a list  I will speak to this byand by  Lord M  reading on  And this Madam be means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with  Then again in a hurry off went the spectacles  This was a plaguy stroke upon me I thought myself an oak in impudence but by my troth this had almost felled me  Lord M  What say you to this SIRR  Remember Jack to read all their  Sirs  in this dialogue with a doubler  rr Sirr  denoting indignation rather than respect  They all looked at me as if to see if I could blush  Lovel  Eyes off my LordEyes off Ladies  look∣ing fashfully I believe  What say I to this my Lord Why I say that this lady has a strong manner of express∣ing herself That's all There are many things that pass among Lovers which a man cannot explain himself upon before grave people  Lady Betty  Among Lovers  SirrBut Mr Lovelace cay you say that this lady behaved either like a weak or a credulous personCan you say  Lovel  I am ready to do the lady all manner of justice But pray now Ladies if I am to be thus inter∣rogated let me know the contents of the rest of the letter that I may be prepared for my defence as you are all for my arraignment For to be required to answer piecemeal thus without knowing what is to follow is a cursed insnaring way of proceeding  They gave me the letter I read it thro' to myself And by the repetition of what I said thou wilt guess at the remaining contents  You shall find Ladies you shall find my Lord that I will not spare myself Then holding the letter in my hand and looking upon it as a lawyer upon his breviate  Miss Harlowe says  That when your Ladyship  turn∣ing to Lady Betty  shall know that in the progress to her ruin wilful falshoods repeated forgeries and number∣less perjuries were not the least of my crimes you will judge that she can have no principles that will make her worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours and your noble sisters character if she could not from her soul declare that such an alliance can never now take place  Surely Ladies this is passion This is not reason If our family would not think themselves dishonoured by my marrying a person whom I had so treated but on the contrary would rejoice that I did this justice and if she has come out pure gold from the assay and has nothing to reproach herself with why should it be an impeachment of her principles to consent that such an alliance should take place  She cannot think herself the worse  justly  she cannot for what was done against her will  Their countenances menaced a general uproarBut I proceeded  Your Lordship read to us That she had an  hope  a  pre∣sumptuous  one nay a  punishably presumptuous  one she calls it  that she might be a means in the hands of Providence to reclaim me and that this she knew if effected would give her a merit with you all  But  from  what  would she reclaim meShe had  heard  you'll say but she had  only  heard at the time she held  That Hope  that to express myself in the womens dialect I was  a very wicked fellow  Well and what then Why truly the very moment she was  convinced  by her own experience that the charge against me was  more  than  hearsay  and that of consequence I was a fit subject for her  generous endeavours  to work upon she would needs give me up Accordingly she flies out and declares that the ceremony which would repair all shall never take place Can this be from any other motive than  female resentment  This brought them all upon me as I intended it should It was as a tub to the whale and after I had let them play with it awhile I claimed their attention and know∣ing that they always loved to hear me prate went on  The lady it is plain thought that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits was a much  easier task  than in the  nature of things  it  can  be  She writes as your Lordship has read  That in endea∣vouring to save a drowning wretch she had been not ac∣cidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him  But how is this LadiesYou see by her own words that I am still far from being out of danger myself Had she found me in a quagmire suppose and I had got out of it by her means and left her to perish in it that would have been a crime indeed But is not the fact quite otherwise Has she not if her allegory proves what she would have it prove got out herself and left me floundering still deeper and deeper inWhat she should have done had she been in earnest to save me was to join her hand with mine that so we might by our united strength help one another outI held out my hand to her and besought her to give me hersBut no truly she was determin'd to get out herself as fast as she could let me  sink or swim  Refusing her assitance against her own principles because she saw I wanted it You see Ladies you see my Lord how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be musical  They were all ready to exclaim again But I went on  proleptically  as a rhetorician would say before their voices could break out into words  But my fair accuser says That  I have added to the list of those I have ruin'd a name that would not have disparaged my own  It is true I have been gay and enterprising It is in my constitution to be so I know not how I came by such a constitution But I was never accustomed to check or controul that you all know When a man finds himself hurry'd by passion into a slight offence which however slight will not be forgiven he may be made desperate As a thief who only intends a robbery is often by resistance and for selfpreservation drawn in to commit a murder  I was a strange a horrid wretch with every one But he must be a silly fellow who has not something to say for himself when every cause has its black and its white sideWestminsterhall Jack affords every day as confident defences as mine  But what right proceeded I has this lady to complain of me when she as good as saysHere Lovelace you have acted the part of a villain by meYou would  re∣pair your fault  But I won't let you that I may have the satisfaction of exposing you and the pride of re∣fusing you  But was that the case Was that the case Would I pre∣tend to say I would  now  marry the lady if she would have me  Lovel  You find she renounces Lady Betty's mediation  Lord M  interrupting me  Words are wind but deeds are mind  What signifies your cursed quibbling Bob Say plainly If she will have you will you have her Answer me Yes or No and lead us not  a wildgoosechace  after your meaning  Lovel  She knows I would But here my Lord if she thus goes on to expose herself and me she will make it a dishonour to us both to marry  Charl  But how must she have been treated  Lovel  interrupting her  Why now cousin Charlotte chucking her under the chin would you have me tell you all that has passed between the lady and me Would Yo  care had you a bold and enterprising lover that procla∣mation should be made of every little piece of amorous roguery that he offer'd to you  Charlotte redden'd They all began to exclaim But I proceeded  The lady says  She has been dishonour'd devil take me if I spare myself by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with them  She is a very innocent lady and may not be a  judge  of the means she hints at  Overniceness may be underniceness  Have you not such a proverb my Lordtantamount to  One extreme produces another  Such a lady as This may possibly think her case more extraordinary than it is This I will take upon me to say That if she has met with the only man in the world who would have treated her as she says I have treated her I have met in her with the  only woman in the world  who would have made such a rout about a case that is uncommon only from the cir∣cumstances that attend it  This brought them all upon me hands eyes voices all lifted up at once But my Lord M who has in his  head  the last seat of retreating lewdness as much wicked∣ness as I have in my  heart  was forced upon the air I spoke this with and Charlotte's and all the rest reddening to make a mouth that was big enough to swallow up the other half of his face crying out to avoid laughing Oh Ohas if under the power of a gouty twinge  Hadst thou seen how the two tabbies and the young grimalkins looked at one another at my Lord and at me by turns thou too wouldst have been ready to split thy ugly face just in the middle Thy mouth has already done half the work And after all I found not seldom in this conversation that my humorous undaunted way forced a smile into my service from the prim mouths of the  younger  ladies especially For the case not being likely to be theirs they could not be so much affected by it as the elders who having had Roses of their own would have been very loth to have had them nipt in the bud without saying By your leave Mrs Rose bush to the mother of it  The next article of my indictment was for forgery and for personating of Lady Betty and my cousin Charlotte Two shocking charges thou'lt say And so they were The Peer was outrageous upon the  forgery  charge  The Ladies vow'd never to forgive the  personating  part Not a peacemaker among them So we all turn'd wo∣men and scolded  My Lord told me That he believed in his conscience there was not a viler fellow upon  God's earth  than me What signifies mincing the matter said heAnd that it was not the first time I had forged his hand  To this I answer'd that I supposed When the statute of  scandalum magnatum  was framed there were a good many in the peerage who knew they deserved hard names and that that Law therefore was rather made to privilege their qualities than to whiten their characters  He called upon me to explain myself with a  Sirr  so pronounced as to shew that one of the most ignominious words in our language was in his head  People I said that were fenced in by their quality and by their years should not take freedoms that a man of spirit could not put up with unless he were able heartily to despise the insulter  This set him in a violent passion He would send for Pritchard instantly Let Pritchard be called He would alter his will and all he  could  leave from me he  would  Do do my Lord said I I always valued my own pleasure above your estate But I'll let Pritchard know that if he draws he shall sign and seal  Why what would I do to Pritchard Shaking his crazy head at me  Only what he or any man else writes with his pen to despoil me of what I think my right he shall seal with his ears that's all my Lord  Then the two Ladies interposed  Lady Sarah told me That I carried things a great way and that neither Lord M nor any of them deserved the treatment I gave them  I said I could not bear to be used ill by my Lord for two reasons first Because I respected his Lordship above any man living and next Because it look'd as if I were induced by selfish considerations to take that from Him which nobody else would offer to me  And what return'd he shall be my inducement to take what I do at your handsHay Sir  Indeed cousin Lovelace said Lady Betty with great gravity we do not any of us as Lady Sarah says deserve at your hands the treatment you give us And let me tell you that I don't think my character and your cousin Charlotte's ought to be prostituted in order to ruin an innocent lady She must have known early the good opinion we all have of her and how much we wished her to be your wife This good opinion of ours has been an inducement to her  you see she says so  to listen to your address And this with her friends folly has helped to throw her into your power How you have requited her is too apparent It becomes the cha∣racter we all bear to disclaim your actions by her And let me tell you that to have her abused by wicked people raised up to personate us or any of us makes a double call upon us to disclaim them  Lovel  Why this is talking somewhat like I would have you all disclaim my actions I own I have done very vilely by this lady One step led to another I am curst with an enterprising spirit I hate to be foiled  Foiled  interrupted Lady Sarah What a shame to talk at this rateDid the lady set up a contention with you All nobly sincere and plainhearted have I heard Miss Clarissa Harlowe is Above art above disguise neither the Coquet nor the PrudePoor lady She de∣served a better fate from the man for whom she took the step which she so freely blames  This above half affected me Had this dispute been so handled by every one I had been ashamed to look up I began to be bashful  Charlotte ask'd If I did not still seem inclinable to do the lady justice if she would have  me  It would be she dared to say the greatest felicity the family could know She would answer for one that this fine lady were of it  They all declared to the same effect and Lady Sarah put the matter home to me  But my Lord  Marplot  would have it that I could not be serious for six minutes together  I told his Lordship that he was mistaken light as he thought I made of this subject I never knew any that went so near my heart  Miss Patty said She was glad to hear  that  Indeed she was glad to hear  that  And her soft eyes glistened with pleasure  Lord M called her Sweet soul and was ready to cry  Not from humanity neither Jack This Peer has no bowels as thou may'st observe by his treatment of  me  But when peoples minds are weaken'd by a sense of their own infirmities and when they are drawing on to their latter ends they will be moved on the slightest occasions whether those offer from  within  or  without  them And this frequently the unpenetrating world calls  humanity  when all the time in compassionating the miseries of human nature they are but pitying themselves and were they in strong health and spirits would care as little for anybody else as thou or I do  Here broke they off my tryal for this Sitting Lady Sarah was much fatigued It was agreed to pursue the sub∣ject in the morning They all however retired together and went into private conference  LETTER XXXI  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  THE Ladies instead of taking up the subject where we had laid it down must needs touch upon pas∣sages in my fair accuser's letter which I was in hopes they would have let rest as we were in a tolerable way But truly they must hear all they could hear of our story and what I had to say to those passages that they might be better enabled to mediate between us if I were really and indeed inclined to do her the hopedfor justice  These passages were st  That after I had trick'd her against her will into the act of going off with me I carried her to one of the worst houses in London  "That I had made a wicked attempt upon her in "resentment of which she fled to Hamstead privately  dly Came the forgery and personating charge again and we were upon the point of renewing ou  quarrel before we could get to the next charge Which was still worse  For that thly was  That having trick'd her back to the vile house I had first robbed her of her senses and then of her honour detaining her afterwards a prisoner there  Were I to tell thee the glosses I put upon these heavy charges what would it be but to repeat many of the extenuating arguments I have used in my letters to thee Suffice it therefore to say that I insisted much by way of palliation on the lady's extreme niceness On her diffidence in my honour On Miss Howe's contriving spirit plots on their parts begetting plots on mine On the high passions of the sex I asserted that my whole view in gently restraining her was to oblige her to for∣give me and to marry me and this for the honour of both families I boasted of my own good qualities some of which none that know me deny and which few libertines can lay claim to  They then fell into warm admirations and praises of the lady all of them preparatory as I knew to the grand question And thus it was introduced by Lady Sarah  We have said as much as I think we can say upon these letters of the poor lady To dwell upon the mischiefs that may ensue from the abuse of a person of her rank if all the reparation be not made that now can be made would perhaps be to little purpose But you seem Sir still to have a just opinion of her as well as affection for her Her virtue is not in the least questionable She could not resent as she does had she any thing to reproach herself with She is by everybody's account a fine woman has a good estate in her own right is of no contemptible family tho' I think with regard to her they have acted as imprudently as unworthily For the excellency of her mind for good oeconomy the common speech of her as the worthy Dr Lewin once told me is  That her prudence would enrich a poor man and her piety reclaim a licentious one  I who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth came hither purposely so did Lady Betty to see if justice may not be done her and also whether we and my Lord M your nearest relations Sir have or have not any influence over you And for my own part as your determination shall be in this article such shall be  mine with regard to the disposition of all that is within my power  Lady Betty  And mine  And mine said my Lord And valiantly he swore to it  Lovel  Far be it from me to think slightly of favours you may any of you be glad I would deserve But as far be it from me to enter into conditions against my own liking with sordid viewsAs to future mischiefs let them come I have not done with the Harlowes yet They were the aggressors and I should be glad they would let me hear from them in the way they should hear from me in the like case Perhaps I should not be sorry to be  found  rather than be obliged to  seek  on this occasion  Miss Charlotte  reddening  Spoke like a man of vio∣lence rather than a man of reason I hope you'll allow that cousin  Lady Sarah  Well but since what is done  is  done and cannot be undone let us think of the next best Have you any objection against marrying Miss Harlowe if she will have you  Lovel  There can possibly be but one That she is every∣where no doubt as well as to Lady Betty pursuing that maxim peculiar to herself  and let me tell you so it ought to be  That what she cannot conceal from herself she will publish to all the world  Miss Patty  The lady to be sure writes this in the bitterness of her grief and in despair  And this from  you  cousin Patty  Sweet girl  And would  you  my dear in the like case whispering her have meant no more by the like exclamations  I had a rap with her fan and a blush and from Lord M a reflection That I turn'd into jest every thing they said  I asked If they thought the Harlowes deserved any consideration from me and whether that family would not exult over me were I to marry their daughter as if I  dared  not to do otherwise  Lady Sarah  Once I was angry with that family as w  all were But now I pity them and think that you have but too well justified the worst treatment they gave you  Lord M  Their family is of standing All gentlemen of it and rich and reputable Let me tell you that  many of our coronets would be glad they could derive their descents from no worse a stem than theirs  Lovel  They are a narrowsoul'd and implacable family I hate them And tho' I revere the lady scorn all rela∣tion to them  Lady Betty  I wish no worse could be said of  him  who is such a scorner of common failings in  others  Lord M  How would my sister Lovelace have reproached herself for all her indulgent folly to this favourite boy of hers had she lived till now and been present on this occasion  Lady Sarah  Well but begging your Lordship's pardon let us see if any thing can be done for this poor lady  Miss Ch  If Mr Lovelace has nothing to object against the lady's character and I presume to think he is not  asham'd  to do her justice tho' it may make against him∣self I cannot see but honour and generosity will com∣pel from him all that we expect If there be any levities any weaknesses to be charg'd upon the lady I should not open my lips in her favour tho' in private I would pity her and deplore her hard hap And yet even then there might not want arguments from honour and grati∣tude in so particular a case to engage you Sir to make good the vows it is plain you have broken  Lady Betty  My niece Charlotte has called upon you so justly and has put the question to you so properly that I cannot but wish you would speak to it directly and without evasion  All in a breath then bespoke my seriousness and my justice And in this manner I deliver'd myself assuming an air sincerely solemn  I am very sensible that the performance of the task you have put me upon will leave me without excuse But I will not have recourse either to evasion or pal∣liation  As my cousin Charlotte has severely observ'd I am not  asham'd  to do justice to Miss Harlowe's merit in words altho' I will confess that I ought to blush that I have done it so little in deeds  I own to  you  all and what is more with high regret if not with  shame  cousin Charlotte that I have a  great deal to answer for in my usage of this lady The Sex has not a nobler mind nor a lovelier person of it And for  virtue  I could not have believed excuse me Ladies that there ever was a woman who  gave  or  could  have given such illustrious such uniform proofs of it For in her whole conduct she has shewn herself to be equally above temptation and art and I had almost said human frailty  The step she so freely blames herself for taking was truly what she calls  compulsatory  For tho' she was pro∣voked to  think  of going off with me she intended it not nor was provided to do so Neither would she ever have had the  thought  of it had her relations left her free upon her offer'd composition to renounce the man she did  not  hate in order to avoid the man she  did  It piqu'd my pride I own that I could so little de∣pend upon the force of those impressions which I had the vanity to hope I had made in a heart so delicate and in my worst devices against her I encouraged my∣self that I abused no confidence for none had she in my honour  The evils she has suffer'd it would have been more than a miracle had she avoided  er watchfulness render'd more plots abortive than those which con∣tributed to her fall and they were many and various And all her greater trials and hardships were owing to her oble resistance and just resentment  I know proceeded I how much I condemn myself in the justice I am doing to this excellent creature But yet I  will  do her justice and cannot help it if I would And I hope this shews that I am not so to∣tally abandon'd as I have been thought to be  Indeed with me she has done more honour to hte Sex in her fall if it be to be called a fall In truth  ought not than ever any other could do in her stand∣ing  When at length I had given her watchful virt  cause of suspicion I was then indeed obliged to mak  use of power and art to hinder her from escaping fro  me She then formed contrivances to elude mine b  all  hers  were such as strict truth and punctilious ho∣nour would justify She could not stoop to deceit and falshood no not to save herself More than once justly did she tell me fired by conscious worthiness that her soul was my soul's superiorForgive me Ladies for saying that till I knew  her  I question'd a Soul in a Sex created as I was willing to suppose only for temporary purposesIt is not to be imagin'd into what absurdities men of free principles run in order to justify to themselves their free practices and to make a religion to their minds And yet in this respect I have not been so faulty as some others  No wonder that such a noble creature as this looked upon every studied artifice as a degree of baseness not to be forgiven No wonder that she could so easily become averse to the man tho' once she beheld him with an eye not wholly indifferent whom she thought capable of premeditated guiltNor give me leave on the other hand to say is it to be wonder'd at that the man who found it so difficult to be forgiven for the  s  ghter  offences and who had not the grace to recede or repent made desperate should be hurried on to the commission of the  greater  In short Ladies in a word my Lord Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an angel if ever there was or could be one in human nature And is and ever was as pure as an angel in her will And this justice I must do her altho' the question I see by every glistening eye is ready to be asked What then Lovelace are you  Lord M  A devilA damn'd devil I must answer And may the curse of God follow you in all you under∣take if you do not make her the best amends now in your power to make her  Lov  l  From you my Lord I could expect no other But from the Ladies I hope for less violence from the in∣genuity of my confession  The Ladies elder and younger had their handkerchiefs to their eyes at the just testimony which I bore to the merits of this exalted creature and which I would make no scruple to bear at the Bar of a Court of Justice were I to be called to it  Lady Betty  Well Sir this is a noble character If you think as you speak surely you cannot refuse to do the lady all the justice now in your power to do her  They all joined in this demand  I pleaded that I was sure she would not have me That when she had taken a resolution she was not to be moved Unpersuadableness was an Harlowe sin That and her name I told them were all she had of theirs  All were of opinion that she might in her present desolate circumstances be brought to forgive me Lady Sarah said that her sister and she would endeavour to find out the  Noble Sufferer  as they justly called her and would take her into their protection and be guaranties to her of the justice that I would do her as well after mar∣riage as before  It was some pleasure to me to observe the placability of these ladies of my own family had they any or either of them met with a LOVELACE But 'twould be hard upon us honest fellows Jack if all women were CLARISSA'S  Here I am obliged to break off  LETTER XXXII  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  IT is much better Jack to tell your own story when it  must  be know than to have an adversary tell it for you Conscious of this I gave them a particular ac∣count how urgent I had been with her to fix upon the Thursday after I left her it being her uncle Harlowe's anniversary birthday and named to oblige her for the private celebration having some days before actually procured a Licence which still remained with her  That not being able to prevail upon her to promise any thing while under a supposed restraint I offered to leave her at full liberty if she would give me the least hope for that day But neither did this offer avail me  That this inflexibleness making me desperate I re∣solved to add to my former fault by giving directions that she should not either go or correspond out of the house till I returned from M Hall well knowing that if she were at full liberty I must for ever lose her  That this constraint had so much incensed her that altho' I wrote no less than four different letters I could not procure a single word in answer tho' I pressed her but for four words to signify the day and the church  I referred to my two cousins to vouch for me the extra∣ordinary methods I took to send messengers to town tho' they knew not the occasion Which now I told them was  this  I acquainted them that I even had wrote to you Jack and to another gentleman of whom I thought she had a good opinion to attend her in order to press for her compliance holding myself in readiness the last day at Salthill to meet the messenger they should send and proceed to London if his message were favourable But that before they could attend her she had found means to fly away once more And is now said I perch'd per∣haps somewhere under Lady Betty's window at Glenham Hall and there like the sweet Philomela a thorn in her breast warbles forth her melancholy complaints against her barbarous Tereus  Lady Betty declared That she was not with  her  nor did she know where she was She should be she added the most welcome guest to her that she ever received  In truth I had a suspicion that she was already in their knowlege and taken into their protection for Lady Sarah I imagin'd incapable of being roused to this spirit by a letter only from Miss Harlowe and that not directed to herself she being a very indolent and melancholy wo∣man But her sister I find had wrought her up to it For Lady Betty is as officious and managing a woman as Mrs Howe but of a much more generous and noble dispositionShe is  my aunt  Jack  I supposed I said that her Ladyship might have a pri∣vate direction where to send to her I spoke as I wish'd I would have given the world to have heard that she was inclined to cultivate the interest of any of my family  Lady Betty answer'd that she had no direction but what was in the letter which she had scratched out and which it was probable was only a temporary one in order to avoid me Otherwise she would hardly have directed an answer to be left at an inn And she was of opinion that  to apply to Miss Howe would be the only certain way to succeed in any application for forgiveness would I enable that young lady to interest herself in procuring it  Miss Charlotte  Permit me to make a proposalSince we are all of one mind in relation to the justice due to Miss Harlowe if Mr Lovelace will oblige himself to marry her I will make Miss Howe a visit little as I am acquainted with her and endeavour to engage her interest to forward the desired reconciliation And if this can be done I make no question but all may be happily accom∣modated for everybody knows the love there is between Miss Harlowe and Miss Howe  MARRIAGE  with these women thou seest Jack is an atonement for all we can do to them A true dra∣matic recompence  This motion was highly approved of and I gave my honour as desired in the fullest manner they could wish  Lady Sarah  Well then cousin Charlotte begin your treaty with Miss Howe out of hand  Lady Betty  Pray do And let Miss Harlowe be told that I am ready to receive her as the welcomest of guests And I will not have her out of my sight till the knot is tied  Lady Sarah  Tell her from me That she shall be my daughterInstead of my poor BetseyAnd shed a tear in remembrance of her lost daughter  Lord M  What say you Sir to this  Lovel  CONTENT my Lord I speak in the la  ∣guage of your house  Lord M  We are not to be fooled nephew No quib∣bling We will have no stur put upon us  Lovel  You shall not And yet I did not intend to marry if she exceeded the appointed Thursday But I think according to her own notions that I have injure  her beyond reparation altho' I were to make her  best of husbands as I am resolved to be if she  condescend  as I will call it to have me And be Thi  cousin Charlotte  my  part of your commission to say  This pleased them all  Lord M  Give thy hand BobThou talkest like man of honour at last I hope we may depend upon w  thou sayest  The Ladies eyes put the same question to me  Lovel  You may my Lord You may Ladies Abso∣lutely you may  Then was the personal character of the lady as well as her more extraordinary talents and endowments again expatiated upon And Miss Patty who had once seen her launched out more than all the rest in her praise These were followed by  Familycogencies  what never are forgotten to be inquired after in marriagetreaties the  principal inducements  to the  Sages  of a family and the  least to be mentioned  by the  Parties  themselves altho' even by  them  perhaps the  first  thought of That is to say inqui∣sition into the lady's fortune into the particulars of the grandfather's estate and what her father and her singlesoul'd uncles will probably do for her if a reconciliation be effected as by  their  means they make no doubt but it will between both families if it be not my fault The two Venerables No longer Tabbies with me now hinted at rich presents on their own parts and my Lord declared that he would make such overtures in my behalf as should render my marriage with Miss Harlowe the best day's work I ever made and what he doubted not but would be as agreeable to that family as to myself  Thus at present by a single hair hangs over my head the matrimonial sword And thus ended my tryal And thus are we all friends and Cousin and Cousin and Nephew and Nephew at every word  Did ever Comedy end more happily than this long tryal  LETTER XXXIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn July    SO Jack they think they have gain'd a mighty point But  were  I to change my mind were I to repent I fancy I am safeAnd yet this very moment it rises to my mind that 'tis hard trusting too for surely there must be some embers where there was fire so lately that may be stirr'd up to give a blaze to combustibles strew'd lightly upon them Love like some selfpropagating plants or  roots which have taken strong hold in the earth when once got deep into the heart is hardly ever  totally  extir∣pated except by Matrimony indeed which is the Grave of Love because it allows of the End of Love Then these ladies all advocates  for  herself  with  herself Miss Howe at their head perhaps Not in favour to me I don't expect That from Miss Howe But perhaps in favour to  herself  For Miss Howe has reason to apprehend vengeance from me I ween Her Hickman will be safe too as she may think if I marry her beloved friend For he has been a busy fellow and I have long wish'd to have a slap at him The lady's case desperate with her friends too and likely to be so while single and her character exposed to censure  A husband is a charming cloak a figleaf'd apron for a wife And for a lady to be protected in liberties in di∣versions which her hear  pants afterand all her faults even the most criminal were she to be detected to be thrown upon the husband and the ridicule too a charm∣ing eligible for a wife  But I shall have one comfort if I marry which pleases me not a little If a man's wife has a dear friend of her sex a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend which could  not  be taken if the  single lady  knowing what a title to freedoms marriage has given him with her  friend  was not less scrupulous with him than she ought to be as to  herself  Then there are  broad  freedoms shall I call them that may be taken by the husband with his wife that may not be  quite  shocking which if the wife  bears before her friend  will serve for a lesson to  that friend  and if that friend  bears  to be present at them without check or bash∣fulness will shew a sagacious fellow that she can bear as much herself at  proper time  and  place Chastity  Jack like  Piety  is an uniform thing If in  look  if in  speech  a girl gives way to undue levity depent upon it the de∣vil has got one of his cloven feet in her heart already So Hickman take care of thyself I advise thee whether I marry or not  Thus Jack have I at once reconciled myself to all my relationsAnd if the lady refuses me thrown the fault upon her This I knew would be in my power  to do at any time And I was the more arrogant to them in order to heighten the merit of my compliance  But after all It would be very whimsical would it not if all my plots and contrivances should end in wedlock What a punishment would this come out to be upon my∣self too that all this while I have been plundering my own treasury  But Jack two things I must insist upon with thee if this is to be the caseHaving put secrets of so high a nature between me and my spouse into thy power I must for my own honour and the honour of my wife and my illustrious progeny first oblige thee to give up the letters I have so profusely scribbled to thee and in the next place do by thee as I have heard whisper'd in France was done by the  true  father of a certain monarque that is to say cut thy throat to prevent thy telling of tales  I have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me by communicating to them the contents of the four last letters which I wrote to press my elected spouse to solemnize My Lord has repeated one of his phrases in my favour that he hopes it will come out  That the devil is not quite so black as he is painted  Now pr'ythee dear Jack since so many good conse∣quences are to flow from these our nuptials one of which to  thyself  since the sooner thou diest the less thou wilt have to answer for and that I nowandthen am apt to believe there may be something in the old fellow's notion who once told us that he who kills a man has all that man's sins to answer for as well as his own because he gave him not the time to repent of them that Heaven design'd to allow him A fine thing for thee if thou con∣sentest to be knock'd of the head but a cursed one for the manslayer and since there may be room to fear that Miss Howe will not give us her help I pr'ythee now exert thyself to find out my Clarissa Harlowe that I may make a LOVELACE of her Set all the city bellmen and the country criers for ten miles round the metropolis at work with their  O yes's and if any man woman or child can give tale or tidings  Advertise her in all the newspapers and let her know  That if she will  repair to Lady Betty Lawrance or to Miss Charlotte Montague she may hear of something greatly to her advantage  MY two cousins Montague are actually to set out tomorrow to Mrs Howe's to engage her vixen daughter's interest with her friend To flaunt it away in a chariot and six for the greater state and significance  Confounded mortification to be reduced thus low My pride hardly knows how to brook it  Lord M has engaged the two venerables to stay here to attend the issue And I standing very high at present in their good graces am to gallant them to Oxford to Blenheim and several other places  LETTER XXXIV  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Thursday night July    COllins sets not out tomorrow Some domestic occa∣sion hinders him Rogers is but now return'd from you and cannot well be spared Mr Hickman is gone upon an affair of my mother's and has taken both his servants with him to do credit to his employer So I am forced to venture this by the post directed by your assumed name  I am to acquaint you that I have been favoured with a visit from Miss Montague and her sister in Lord M's chariot and six My Lord's gentleman rode here yester∣day with a request that I would receive a visit from the two young ladies on a  very particular occasion  the greater favour if it might be the next day  As I had so little personal knowlege of either I doubted not but it must be in relation to the interests of my dea  friend and so consulting with my mother I sent them an invitation to favour me because of the distance wit  their company at dinner which they kindly accepted  I hope my dear since things have been so  very  bad that their errand to me will be as agreeable to you a  any thing that can now happen They came in the name  of Lord M and his two Sisters to desire my interest to engage you to put yourself into the protection of Lady Betty Lawrance who will not part with you till she sees all the justice done you that now can be done  Lady Sarah Sadleir had not stirr'd out for a twelve∣month before never since she lost her agreeable daughter whom you and I saw at Mrs Benson's But was induced to take this journey by her sister purely to procure you reparation if possible And their joint strength united with Lord M's has so far succeeded that the wretch has bound himself to them and to these young ladies in the solemnest manner to wed you in their presence if they can prevail upon you to give him your hand  This consolation you may take to yourself that all this honourable family have a  duc  that is the  highest  sense of your merit and greatly admire you The horrid creature has not spared himself in doing justice to you virtue and the young ladies gave us such an account of his confessions and selfcondemnation that my mother was quite charmed with you and we all four shed tears of joy that there is one of our sex I that that one is my dearest friend who has done so much honour to it as to deserve the selfconvicted praises he gave you tho' pity for the excellent creature mixed with the sensibility  He promises by them to make the best of husbands and my Lord and his two sisters are both to be guaran∣tees that he will be so Noble settlements noble presents they talked of They say they left Lord M and his two sisters talking of nothing else but of those presents and settlements how most to do you honour the greater in proportion for the indignities you have suffered and of changing of names by act of parliament preparative to the interest they will all join to make to get the titles to go where the bulk of the estate must go at my Lord's death which they apprehend to be nearer than they wish Nor doubt they of a thorough reformation in his morals from your example and influence over him  I made a great many objections for youAll I believe that you could have made yourself had you been present But I have no doubt to advise you my dear and so does my mother instantly to put yourself into Lady Betty's  protection with a resolution to take the wretch for your husband All his future grandeur he wants not pride depends upon his sincerity to you and the young ladies vouch for the depth of his concern for the wrongs he has done you  All his apprehension is in your readiness to communi∣cate to every one as he fears the evils you have suffer'd which he thinks will expose you both But had you not revealed them to Lady Betty you had not had so warm a friend since it is owing to two letters you wrote to her that all this good as I hope it will prove was brought about But I advise you to be more sparing in exposing what is past whether you have thoughts of accepting him or not For what my dear can that avail now but to give a handle to vile wretches to triumph over your friends since every one will not know how much to your honour your very sufferings have been  Your melancholy letter brought by Rogers  See Letter  xxvii  p    preceding  with his account of your indifferent health confirmed to Ro∣gers by the woman of the house as well as by your looks and by your faintness while you talk'd with him would have given me inexpressible affliction had I not been chear'd by this agreeable visit from the young ladies I hope you will be equally so on my imparting the subject of it to you  Indeed my dear you must not hesitate You  must  oblige them The alliance is splendid and honourable Very few will know any thing of his brutal baseness to you All must end in a little while in a general recon∣ciliation and you will be able to resume your course of doing the good to every deserving object which procured you blessings whereever you set your foot  I am concern'd to find that your father's rash wish af∣fects you so much as it does Upon my word my dear your mind is weaken'd grievously You must not indeed you must not desert yourself The penitence you talk of It is for  them  to be penitent who hurried you into evils you could not well avoid You judge by the un∣happy event rather than upon the true merits of your case Upon my honour I think you faultless in almost every  step you have taken What has not that vilely insolent and ambitious yet stupid brother of yours to answer forThat spiteful thing your sister too  But come since what is past cannot be help'd let us look forward You have now happy prospects opening to you A family  already nobl    ready to receive and embrace you with open arms and joyful hearts and who by their love to you will teach another family who know not what an excellence they have confederated to persecute how to value you Your prudence your piety will crown all It will reclaim a wretch that for an hundred sakes more than for his own one would wish to be reclaimed  Like a traveller who has been put out of his way by the overflowing of some rapid stream you have only had the foreright path you were in overwhelmed A few miles about a day or two only lost as I may say and you are in a way to recover it and by quickening your speed will get up the lost time The hurry upon your spirits mean time will be all your inconvenience for it was not your fault you were stopt in your progress  Think of this my dear and improve upon the alle∣gory as you know how If you can without impeding your progress be the means of assuaging the inundation of bounding the waters within their natural channel and thereby of recovering the overwhelmed path for the sake of future passengers who travel the same way what a merit will yours be  I shall impatiently expect your next letter The young ladies proposed that you should put yourself if in town or near it into the Reading stagecoach which inns somewhere in Fleetstreet And if you give notice of the day you will be met on the road and that pretty early in your journey by some of both sexes one of whom you won't be sorry to see  Mr Hickman shall attend you at Slough and Lady Betty herself and one of the Misses Montague with proper equipages will be at Reading to receive you and carry you directly to the seat of the former For I have ex∣presly stipulated that the wretch himself shall not come  into your presence will your nuptials are to be solemnized unless you give leave  Adieu my dearest friend Be happy And hundreds will then be happy of consequence Inexpressibly so I am sure will then be  Your everaffectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXXV  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Sunday night July    My dearest friend  WHY would you permit a mind so much devoted to your service to labour under such an impatience as you must know it  would  labour under for want of an answer to a letter of such consequence to  you  and there∣fore to  me  Rogers told me last Thursday you were  so  ill Your letter sent by him was  so  melancholy Yet you must be ill indeed if you could not write something to such a letter were it but a line to say you would write as soon as you could Sure you have received it The master of our nearest postoffice will pawn his reputation that it went safe I gave him particular charge of it  God send me good news of your health of your ability to write and then I will chide youIndeed I willas I never yet did chide you  I suppose your excuse will be that the subject required considerat  onLord my dear so it might But you have so right a mind and the matter in question is so obvious that you could not want half an hour to determine Then you intended probably to wait Collins's call for your letter as on tomorrowSupposeMissindeed I am angry with you suppose something were to hap∣pen as it did on Friday that he should not be able to go to town tomorrowHow child could you serve me soI know not how to leave off scolding you  Dear honest Collins make haste He will He will He sets out and travels all night For I have told him that the dearest friend I have in the world has it in her own choice to be happy and to make me so and that the letter he will bring from her will assure it to me  I have order'd him to go directly without stopping at the Saracen'shead inn to you at your lodgings Matters are now in so good a way that he safely may  Your expected letter is ready written I hope If it be not he will call for it at your hour  You can't be so happy as you deserve to be But I doubt not that you will be as happy as you  can  that is that you will choose to put yourself instantly into Lady Betty's protection If you would not have him for  your own  sake have him you must for  mine  for your  family  's for your  honour  's sake Dear honest Collins make haste make haste and relieve the impatient heart of my Beloved's  Everfaithful everaffectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXXVI  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE  Tuesday Morning July    Madam  I Take the liberty to write to you by this special mes∣senger In the phrensy of my soul I write to you to demand of you and of any of your family who can tell news of my beloved friend

would injure such an innocent and now who knows what he was done with her  If I have patience I will give you the occasion of this distracted vehemence  I wrote to her the very moment you and your sister left me But being unable to procure a special messenger as I intended was forced to send by the post I urged her you know I promised that I would I urged her with earnestness to comply with the desires of all your family Having no answer I wrote again on Sunday night and sent it by a particular hand who travelled all night chide∣ing her for keeping a heart so impatient as mine in such cruel suspense upon a matter of so much importance to  her and therefore to me And very angry I was with her in my mind  But judge my astonishment my distraction when last night the messenger returning posthaste brought me word that she had not been heard of since Friday morn∣ing And that a letter lay for her at her lodgings which came by the post and must be mine  She went out about six that morning only intending as they believe to go to morning prayers at Coventgar∣den church just by her lodgings as she had done divers times before Went on footLeft word she should be back in an hourVery

joyful news as she thought it would be to me in an exulting letter from Sally Martin that she had found out my angel as on Wednesday last and on Friday morning after she had been at prayers at Coventgarden churchpraying for my reformation perhaps got her arrested by two sheriffs officers as she was return∣ing to her lodgings who put her into a chair they had in readiness and carried her to one of the cursed fellows houses  She has arrested her for  l  pretendedly due for board and lodgings A sum besides the low villainy of the pro∣ceeding which the dear soul could not possibly raise all

CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE  To Miss  HOWE  M Hall Tuesday afternoon  Dear Miss  HOWE  YOUR letter has infinitely disturbed us all  This wretched man has been half distracted ever since Saturday night  We knew not what ailed him till your letter was brought  Vile wretch as he is he is however innocent of this new evil  Indeed he is he  must  be as I shall more at large ac∣quaint you  But will not now detain your messenger  Only to satisfy your just impatience by telling you that the dear young lady is safe and we hope well  A horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected her to the terror and disgrace of an arrest  Poor dear Miss Harlowe her sufferings have endeared her to us almost as much as her excellencies can have done to you  But she must be now quite at liberty  He has been a distracted man ever since the news was brought him and we knew not what ailed him  But that I said before  My Lord M my Lady Sarah Sadleir and my Lady Betty Lawrance will all write to you this very afternoon  And so will the wretch himself  And send it by a servant of their own not to detain yours  I know not what I write  But you shall have all the particulars just and true and fair from  Dear Madam  Your most faithful and obedient Servant  CH MONTAGUE  LETTER XXXIX  Miss  MONTAGUE  To Miss  HOWE  M Hall  July    Dear Madam  IN pursuance of my promise I will minutely inform you of everything we know relating to this schock∣ing transaction  When we returned from you on Thursday night and made our report of the kind reception both we and our message met with in that you had been so good as to pro∣mise to use your interest with your dear friend it put us all into such good humour with one another and with my cousin Lovelace that we resolved upon a little tour of two days the Friday and Saturday in order to give an airing to my Lord and Lady S  rah both having been long confined one by illness the other by melancholy My Lord his two sisters and myself were in the coach and all our talk was of dear Miss Harlowe and of our future happiness with her Mr Lovelace and my sister who is his favourite as he is hers were in his Phaeton And whenever we joined company that was still the subject  As to him never man praised a lady as he did her Never man gave greater hopes and made better resolu∣tions He is none of those that are governed by interest He is too proud for that But most sincerely delighted was he in talking of her and of his hopes of her return∣ing favour He said however more than once that he feared she would not forgive him for from his heart he must say he deserved not her forgiveness And often and often that there was not such a woman in the world  This I mention to shew you Madam that he could not at this very time be privy to such a barbarous and disgraceful treatment  We returned not till Saturday night all in as good hu∣mour with one another as went out We never had such pleasure in his company before If he would be good and as he ought to be no man would be better be∣loved by relations than he But never was there a greater alteration in man when he came home and received a  letter from a messenger who it seems had been flatter∣ing himself in hopes of a reward and had been waiting for his return from the night before In  such  a fury The man fared but badly He instantly shut himself up to write and ordered man and horse to be ready to set out before daylight the next morning to carry the letter to a friend in London  He would not see us all that night neither breakfast nor dine with us next day He ought he said never to see the light and bid my sister whom he called an  Innocent  and she being very desirous to know the occa∣sion of all this shun him saying He was a wretch and made so by his own inventions and the consequences of them  None of us could get out of him what so disturbed him We should too soon hear he said to the utter dissipation of all  his  hopes and all  ours  We could easily suppose that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady  He was out each day and said he wanted to run away from himself  Late on Monday night he received a letter from Mr Belford his most favoured friend by his own messenger who came back in a foam man and horse Whatever were the contents he was not easier but like a madman rather But still would not let us know the occasion But to my sister he said Nobody my dear Patsey who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit would ever quit the right path  He was out when your messenger came But soon came in and bad enough was his reception from us all And he said that his own torments were greater than ours than Miss Harlowe's or yours Madam all put to∣gether He would see your letter He always carries everything before him And said when he had read it that He thanked God he was not such a villain as you with too much reason thought him  Thus then he owned the matter to be  He had left general directions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from to find out where she was gone to if possible that he might have an opportu∣nity  to importune her to be his before their difference was public The wicked people  officious  at least if not wicked discovered where she was on Wednesday and for fear she should remove before they could have his or∣ders they put her under a  gentle restraint  as they call it and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint him with it and to take his orders  This messenger arrived here on Friday afternoon and tarried till we returned on Saturday nightAnd when he read the letter he broughtI have told you Madam what a fury he was in  The letter he retired to write and which he dispatched away so early on Sunday morning was to conjure his friend Mr Belford on receipt of it to fly to the lady and set her free and to order all her things to be sent her and to clear him of so black and villainous a fact as he justly called it  And by this time he doubts not that all is happily over and the Beloved of his soul as he calls her at every word in an easier and happier way than she was before the horrid fact And now he owns that the reason why Mr Belford's letter set him into stronger ravings was because of his keeping him wilfully and on purpose to torment him in suspense and reflecting very heavily upon him for Mr Belford he says was ever the lady's friend and advocate and only mentioning that he had waited upon her referring to his next for further particu∣lars which he could have told him at the time  He declares and we can vouch for him that he ha  been ever since last Saturday night the miserablest of men  He forbore going up himself that it might not be ima∣gined he was guilty of so black a contrivance and went up to complete any base views in consequence of it  Believe us all dear Miss Howe under the deepest con∣cern at this unhappy accident which will we fear ex∣asperate the charming sufferer not too much for the oc∣casion but too much for our hopes  O what wretches are these freeliving men who love to tread in intricate paths and when once they e  know not how far out of the way their headstrong course may lead them  My sister joins her thanks with mine to your good mo∣ther and self for the favours you heaped upon us last Thursday We beseech your continued interest as to the subject of our visit It shall be all our studies to oblige and recompense the dear lady to the utmost of our power for what she has suffered from the unhappy man  We are dear Madam  Your obliged and faithful Servants  CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE  MARTHA MONTAGUE  Dear Miss  HOWE  WE join in the above request of Miss Charlotte and Miss Patty Montague for your favour and in∣terest being convinced that the accident was an acci∣dent and no plot or contrivance of a wretch too full of them We are Madam  Your most obedient humble Servants  M SARAH SADLEIR  ELIZ LAWRANCE  Dear Miss  HOWE  AFTER what is written above by names and cha∣racters of such unquestionable honour I might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself as I KNOW it is to you But the  above  will have it so Since therefore I  must  write it shall be the truth which is That if I may be once more admitted to pay my duty to the most deserving and most injured of her sex I will be content to do it with a halter about my neck and attended by a parson on my righthand and the hangman on my left be doomed at her will ei∣ther to the church or the gallows  Tuesday July    Your most humble Servant  ROBT LOVELACE  LETTER XL  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sunday night July    WHAT a cursed piece of work hast thou made of it with the most excellent of women Thou  mayest be in earnest or in jest as thou wilt but the poor lady will not be long either thy sport or the sport of fortune  I will give thee an account of a scene that wants but her affecting pen to represent it justly and it would wring all the black blood out of thy callous heart  Thou only who art the author of her calamities shouldst have attended her in her prison I am unequal to such a task Nor know I any other man but would  This last act however unintended by thee yet a con∣sequence of thy general orders and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee by those who know thy other villainies by her has finished thy barbarous work And I advise thee to trumpet forth everywhere how much in earnest thou art to marry her whether thou art or not  Thou mayest  safely  do it She will not live to put thee to the trial and it will a little palliate for thy enormous usage of her and be a means to make mankind who know not what I know of the matter herd a little longer with thee and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellowsavages in the Libyan wilds and deserts  Your messenger found me at Edgware expecting to dinner with me several friends whom I had invited three days before I sent apologies to them as in a case of life and death and speeded to town to the wicked wo∣man's For how knew I but shocking attempts might be made upon her by the cursed wretches perhaps by thy contrivance in order to mortify her into thy measures  Little knows the public what villainies are committed in these abominable houses upon innocent creatures drawn into their snares  Finding the lady not there I posted away to the offi∣cer's altho' Sally told me that she had been but just come from thence and that she had refused to see her or as she sent down word anybody else being resolved to have the remainder of that Sunday to herself as it might perhaps be the last she should ever see  I had the same thing told me when I got thither  I sent up to let her know that I came with a commis∣sion to set her at liberty I was afraid of sending up the name of a man known to be thy friend She absolutely  refused to see  any man  however for that day or to an∣swer further to any thing said from me  Having therefore informed myself of all that the officer and his wife and servant could acquaint me with as well in relation to the horrid arrest as to her behaviour and the womens to her and her ill state of health I went back to Sinclair's as I will still call her and heard the three womens story From all which I am enabled to give thee the following shocking particulars Which may serve till I can see the unhappy lady herself tomorrow if then I can gain admittance to her Thou wilt find that I have been very minute in my inquiries  Thy villain it was that set the poor lady and had the impudence to appear and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction He thought no doubt that he was doing the most acceptable service to his blessed ma∣ster They had got a chair the head ready up as soon as Service was over And as she came out of the church at the door fronting Bedfordstreet the officers stepping to her whispered that they had an action against her  She was terrified trembled and turned pale  Action  said she What is thatI have committed  no bad action  Lord bless me Men what mean you  That you are our prisoner Madam  Prisoner  Sirs WhatHowWhyWhat have I done  You must go with us Be pleased Madam to step into this chair  With  you  With  men  Must go with  men  I am not used to go with  strange men  Indeed you must ex∣cuse me  We can't excuse you We are sheriff'sofficers We have a Writ against you You  must  go with us and you shall know at whose Suit  Suit  said the charming innocent I don't know what you mean Pray men don't lay hands upon meThey offering to put her into the chair I am not used to be thus treatedI have done nothing to deserve it  She then spied by villainO thou wretch said she where is thy vile masterAm I again to be  his prisoner  Help good people  A croud had before begun to gather  My master is in the country Madam many miles off If you please to go with these men they will treat you civilly  The people were most of them struck with compassion A fine young creature A thousand pities some While some few threw out vile and shocking reflections But a gentleman interposed and demanded to see the fel∣lows authority  They shewed it Is your name Clarissa Harlowe Ma∣dam said he  Yes yes indeed ready to sink my name  was  Cla∣rissa HarloweBut it is now  Wretchedness  Lord be merciful to me what is to come next  You  must  go with these men Madam said the gentle∣man They have authority for what they do He pitied her and retired  Indeed you must said one chairman  Indeed you must said the other  Can nobody joined in another gentleman be applied to who will see that so fine a creature is not ill used  Thy villain answered Orders were given particularly for that She had rich relations She need but ask and have She would only be carried to the officer's house till matters could be made up The people she had lodged with loved her But she had left her lodgings privately  O had she those tricks already cried one or two  She heard not thisBut said Well if I must go I mustI cannot resistBut I will not be carried to the woman'sI will rather die at your feet than be car∣ried to the woman's  You won't be carried there Madam cried thy fellow  Only to  my  house Madam said one of the officers  Where is That  In HighHolborn Madam  I know not where HighHolborn is But anywhere except to the woman'sBut am I to go with  men  only  Looking about her and seeing the three passages to wit that leading to Henriettastreet that to Kingstreet and the foreright one to Bedfordstreet crouded she startedAnywhereAnywhere said she but to the wo∣man's  And stepping into the chair threw herself on the seat in the utmost distress and confusion Carry me carry me out of sight Cover me Cover me up for ever were her words  Thy villain drew the curtains She had not power and they went away with her thro' a vast croud of people  Here I must rest I can write no more at present Only Lovelace remember  All this was to a Clarissa  THE unhappy lady fainted away when she was taken out of the chair at the officer's house  Several people followed the chair to the very house which is in a wretched court Sally was there and satisfied some of the inquirers that the young gentlewo∣man would be exceedingly well used And they soon di∣spersed  Dorcas was also there but came not in her sight Sally as a favour offered to carry her to her former lodgings But she declared they should carry her thither a corpse if they did  Very gentle usage the women boast of So would a vultur could it speak with the entrails of its prey upon its rapacious talons Of this thou'lt judge from what I have to recite  She asked What was meant by this usage of her People told me said she that I  must  go with the men That they had authority to take me So I submitted But now what is to be the end of this disgraceful violence  The end said the vile Sally Martin is for honest peo∣ple to come at their own  Bless me Have I taken away any thing that belongs to those who have obtained this power over meI have left very valuable things behind me but have taken no∣thing away that is not my own  And who do you think  Miss Harlowe  for I under∣stand said the cursed creature you are not married who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings such handsome lodgings for so long a time as you were at Mrs Sinclair's  Lord have mercy upon me Miss Martin I think you  are Miss MartinAnd is this the cause of such a dis∣graceful insult upon me in the open streets  And cause enough  Miss Harlowe  fond of gratifying her jealous revenge by calling her  Miss  One hundred and fifty guineas or pounds is no small sum to lose And by a young creature who would have bilked her lodgings  You amaze me Miss MartinWhat language do you talk in  Bilk my lodgings  What is that  She stood astonished and silent for a few moments  But recovering herself and turning from her to the window she wrung her hands The cursed Sally shewed me how and lifting them up  Now  Lovelace Now indeed do I think I  ought  to forgive theeBut who shall forgive Clarissa HarloweO my sister O my brother Tender mercies were your cruelties to  this  After a pause her handkerchief drying up her falling tears she turned to Sally  Now  have I nothing to do but acquiesce Only let me say That if this aunt of yours This Mrs Sinclair or This man This Mr Love∣lace come near me or if I am carried to the horrid house for that I suppose is to be the end of this new out∣rage God be merciful to the poor Clarissa Harlowe Look to the consequenceLook I charge you to the consequence  The vile wretch told her It was not designed to carry her anywhither against her will But if it were they should take care not to be frighted again by a  penknife  She cast up her eyes to heaven and was silentAnd went to the farthest corner of the room and sitting down threw her handkerchief over her face  Sally asked her several questions But not answering her she told her She would wait upon her byandby when she had found her speech  She ordered the people to press her to eat and drink She must be fasting Nothing but her prayers and tears poor thing were the merciless devil's words as she own∣ed to meDost think I did not curse her  She went away and after her own dinner returned  The unhappy lady by this devil's account of her then seemed either mortified into meekness or to have made a  resolution not to be provoked by the insults of this cursed creature  Sally inquired in her presence whether she had eat or drank anything and being told by the woman that she could not prevail upon her to taste a morsel or drink a drop she said This is wrong  Miss Harlowe  Very wrongYour religion I think should teach you that starving yourself is selfmurder  She answered not  The wretch owned she was resolved to make her speak  She asked If Mabell should attend her till it were seen what her friends would do for her in discharge of the debt Mabell said she has not  yet  earned the cloaths you were so good as to give her  Am I not worth an answer  Miss Harlowe  I would answer you said the sweet sufferer without any emotion if I knew how  I have ordered pen ink and paper to be brought you  Miss Harlowe  There they are I know you love write∣ing You may write to whom you please Your friend Miss Howe will expect to hear from you  I have no friend said she I deserve none  Rowland for that is the officer's name told her She had friends enow to pay the debt if she would write  She would trouble nobody she had no friends was all they could get from her while Sally staid But yet spoken with a patience of spirit as if she enjoyed her griefs  The insolent creature went away ordering them in her hearing to be very civil to her and to let her want for nothing Now had she she owned the triumph of her heart over this haughty beauty who kept them all at such a distance in their own house  What thinkest thou Lovelace of thisThis wretch's triumph was over a Clarissa  About six in the evening Rowland's wife pressed her to drink tea She said She had rather have a glass of water for her tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of her mouth  The woman brought her a glass and some bread and butter She tried to taste the latter but could not swal∣low  it But eagerly drank the water lifting up her eyes in thankfulness for that  The divine Clarissa Lovelace reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold waterBy  whom  reduced  About nine o'clock she asked If anybody were to be her bedfellow  Their maid if she pleased or as she was so weak and ill the girl should sit up with her if she chose she should  She chose to be alone both night and day she said But might she not be trusted with the keys of the room where she was to lie down for she should not put off her cloaths  That they told her could not be  She was afraid not she saidBut indeed she would not get away if she could  They told me that they had but one bed besides that they lay in themselves which they would fain have had her accept of and besides  that  their maid lay in in a garret which they called a hole of a garret And that  that  one bed was the prisoner's bed which they made several apologies to me about I suppose it is shocking enough  But the lady would not lie in theirs Was she not a prisoner she saidLet her have the prisoners room  Yet they owned that she started when she was con∣ducted thither But recovering herself Very well said sheWhy should not all be of a pieceWhy should not my wretchedness be complete  She found fault that all the fastenings were on the out∣side and none within and said She could not trust her∣self in a room where others could come in at their plea∣sure and she not go out She had not  been used  to it  Dear dear soulMy tears flow as I write Indeed Lovelace she had not been used to such treatment  They assured her that it was as much their duty to pro∣tect her from other persons insults as from escaping her∣self  Then they were people of more honour she said than she had of late been used to  She asked If they knew Mr Lovelace  No was their answer  Have you heard of him  No  Well then you may be good sort of folks in your way  Pause here a moment Lovelaceand reflectI must  AGAIN they asked her If they should send any word to her lodgings  These are my lodgings now are they notwas all her answer  She sat up in a chair all night the back against the door having it seems thrust a broken piece of a poker thro' the staples where a bolt had been on the inside  NEXT morning Sally and Polly both went to visit her  She had begged of Sally the day before that she might not see Mrs Sinclair nor Dorcas nor the brokentoothed servant called William  Polly would have ingratiated herself with her and pretended to be concerned for her misfortunes But she took no more notice of her than of the other  They asked If she had any commandsIf she  had  she only need to mention what they were and she should be obeyed  None at all she said  How did she like the people of the house Were they civil to her  Pretty well considering she had no money to give them  Would she accept of any money They could put it to her account  She would contract no debts  Had she any money about her  She meekly put her hand in her pocket and pulled out half a guinea and a little silver Yes I have a little But here should be fees paid I believe Should there not I have heard of entrancemoney to compound for not being stript But these people are very civil people I fancy for they have not offered to take away my cloaths  They have  orders  to be civil to you  It is very kind  But we two will bail you  Miss  if you will go back with us to Mrs Sinclair's  Not for the world  Hers are very handsome apartments  The fitter for those who own them  These are very sad ones  The fitter for  me  You may be very happy yet  Miss  if you will  I hope I shall  If you refuse to eat or drink we will give bail and take you with us  Then I will  try  to eat and drink Anything but go with you  Will you not send to your new lodgings The people will be frighted  So they will if I send So they will if they know where I am  But have you no things to send for from thence  There is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble I shall not lessen their security  But perhaps letters or messages may be left for you there  I have very few friends and to those I  have  I will spare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me  We are surprised at your indifference  Miss  Harlowe Will you not write to any of your friends  No  Why you don't think of tarrying  here  always  I shall not  live  always  Do you think you are to stay here as long as you live  That's as it shall please God and those who have brought me hither  Should you like to be at liberty  I am miserableWhat is liberty to the miserable but to be  more  miserable  How  miserable  Miss  You may make yourself as happy as you please  I hope  you  are both happy  We are  May you be more and more happy  But we wish  you  to be so too  I never shall be of your opinion I believe as to what happiness is  What do you take our opinion of happiness to be  To live at Mrs Sinclair's  Perhaps said Sally we were once as squeamish and narrowminded as you  How came it over with you  Because we saw the ridiculousness of prudery  Do you come hither to persuade me to hate prudery as you call it as much as you do  We came to offer our service to you  It is out of your power to serve me  Perhaps not  It is not in my inclination to trouble you  You may be worse offered  Perhaps I may  You are mighty short  Miss  As I wish your visit to be ladies  They owned to me that they cracked their fans and laughed  Adieu perverse Beauty  Your servant Ladies  Adieu Haughtyairs  You see me humbled  As you deserve  Miss  Harlowe Pride will have a fall  Better fall with what  you  call pride than stand with meanness  Who does  I had once a  better  opinion of  you  Miss Horton Indeed you should not insult the miserable  Neither should the  miserable  said Sally insult people for their civility  I should be sorry if I did  Mrs Sinclair shall attend you byandby to know if you have any commands for  her  I have no wish for any liberty but that of refusing to see her and  one  more person  What we came for was to know if you had any pro∣posals to make for your inlargement  Then it seems the officer put in You have very good friends Madam I understand Is it not better that you make it up Charges will run high A hundred and fifty guineas are easier paid than two hundred Let these ladies bail you and go along with them or write to your friends to make it up  Sally said There is a gentleman who saw you taken and was so much moved for you  Miss Harlowe  that he  would gladly advance the money for you and leave you to pay it when you can  See Lovelace what cursed devils these are This is the way we know that many an innocent heart is thrown upon keeping and then upon the town But for these wretches thus to go to work with such an angel as this How glad would have been the devilish Sally to have had the least handle to report to thee a listening ear or patient spirit upon this hint  Sir said she with high indignation to the officer did not you say last night that it was as much your business to protect me from the insults of others as from escaping Cannot I be permitted to see whom I please and to refuse admittance to those I like not  Your creditors Madam will expect to see you  Not if I declare I will not treat with them  Then Madam you will be sent to prison  Prison friendWhat dost thou call thy house  Not a prison Madam  Why these ironbarred windows then Why these double locks and bolts all on the outside none on the In  And down she dropt into her chair and they could not get another word from her She threw her handkerchief over her face as once before which was soon wet with tears and grievously they own she sobbed  Gentle treatment Lovelace Perhaps thou as well as these wretches wilt think it so  Sally then ordered a dinner and said They would soon be back again and see that she eat and drank as a good Christian should comporting herself to her condition and making the best of it  What has not this charming creature suffered what has she not gone thro' in these last three months that I know of Who would think such a delicatelyframed person could have sustained what she has sustained We some∣times talk of bravery of courage of fortitudeHere they are in perfectionSuch bravoes as Thou and I should never have been able to support ourselves under half the persecutions the disappointments and contume∣lies that  she  has met with but like cowards should have slid out of the world basely by some backdoor that is  to say by a sword by a pistol by a halter or knife But here is a fineprincipled lady who by dint of this noble consideration as I imagine what else can support herThat she has  not deserved the evils she contends with  and that  this world is designed but as a transitory state of probation  and that she is  traveling to another and better  puts up with all the hardships of the  journey  and is not to be diverted from her course by the attacks of  thieves  and  robbers  or any other terrors and difficul∣ties  being assured of an ample reward at the end of it  If thou thinkest this reflection uncharacteristic from a companion and friend of thine imaginest thou that I prosited nothing by my attendance on my uncle for so long a time in his dying state and from the pious re∣flections of the good clergyman who day by day at the poor man's own request visited and prayed by him And could I have another such instance  as this  to bring all these reflections home to me  Then who can write of good persons and of good sub∣jects and be capable of  admiring them  and not be made serious for the  time  if he write in characterAnd hence may we gather what a benefit to the morals of men the keeping of  good  company must be while those who keep only  bad  must necessarily more and more harden and be hardened  'TIS twelve of the clock Sunday night I can think of nothing but of this excellent creature Her distresses fill my head and my heart I was drowsy for a quarter of an hour but the fit is gone off And I will continue the melancholy subject from the information of these wretches Enough I dare say will arise in the visit I shall make if admitted tomorrow to send by thy servant as to the way I am likely to find her in  After the women had left her she complained of her head and her heart and seemed terrified witth apprehen∣sions of being carried once more to Sinclair's  Refusing anything for breakfast Mrs Rowland came up to her and told her as these wretches owned they had ordered her for fear she should starve herself That she  must  and  should  have tea and bread and butter▪  And that as she had friends who could support her if she wrote to them it was a wrong thing both for her∣self and  them  to starve herself thus  If it be for  your own sakes  said she that is another thing Let coffee or tea or chocolate or what you will be got And put down a chicken to my account every day if you please and eat it yourselves I will taste it if I can I would do nothing to hinder you I have friends will pay you liberally when they know I am gone  They wonder'd at her strange composure in such di∣stresses  They were nothing she said to what she had suffer'd already from the vilest of all men The disgrace of seizing her in the street multitudes of people about her shocking imputations wounding her ears had indeed been very affecting to her But that was over Every thing soon would And she should be still  more  com∣posed were it not for the apprehensions of seeing one man and one woman and being tricked or forced back to the vilest house in the world  Then were it not better to give way to the two gentle∣womens offer to bail herThey could tell her it was a very kind proffer and what was not be met with every day  She believ'd so  The ladies might possibly dispense with her going back to the house she had such an antipathy to Then the compassionate gentleman who was inclined to make it up with her creditors on her own bond it was strange to them she hearkened not to so generous a proposal  Did the two ladies tell you who the gentleman was Or Did they say any more on that subject  Yes they did and hinted to me said the woman that you had nothing to do but to receive a visit from the gentleman and the money they believed would be laid down on your own bond or note  She was startled  I charge you said she as you will answer it one day to my friends that you bring no gentleman into my com∣pany I charge you don't If you do you know not what may be the consequence  They apprehended no bad consequence they said in doing their duty And if she knew not her own good her friends would thank them for taking any innocent steps to serve her tho' against her will  Don't push me upon extremities man Don't make me desperate womanI have no small difficulty not∣withstanding the seeming composure you just now took notice of to bear as I ought to bear the evils I suffer But if you bring a man or men to me be the pretence  what  it will  She stopt there and look'd so earnestly and so wildly they said that they did not know but she would do some harm to herself if they disobeyed her and that would be a sad thing in  their  house and might be their ruin So they promised that no man should be brought to her but by her own consent  Mrs Rowland prevailed on her to drink a dish of tea and taste some bread and butter about eleven on Saturday morning Which she probably did to have an excuse not to dine with the women when they returned  But she would not quit her  prisonroom  as she called it to go into their parlour  Unbarred windows and a lightsomer apartment she said had too chearful an appearance for her mind  At another time  The light of the sun was irksome to her The sun seemed to shine in to mock her woes  And when soon after a shower fell she looked at it thro' the bars  How kindly said she do the elements weep to keep me company  Methought added she the sun darting in a while ago and gilding those iron bars played upon me like the two women who came to insult my haggard looks by the word  Beauty  and my dejected heart with the word  Haughtyairs  Sally came again at dinnertime  to see how she fared  as she told her and that she did not starve herself And as she wanted to have some talk with her if she gave her leave she would dine with her  I cannot eat  You must try  Miss Harlowe  And dinner being ready just then she offered her hand and desired her to walk down  No she would not stir out of her  prisonroom  These sullen airs won't do  Miss Harlowe  Indeed they won't  She was silent  You will have harder usage than any you have ever yet known I can tell you if you come not into some hu∣mour to make matters up  She was still silent  Come  Miss  walk down to dinner Let me intreat you do Miss Horton is below She was once your favourite  She waited for an answer But received none  We came to make some proposals to you for your good tho' you affronted us so lately And we would not let Mrs Sinclair come in person because we thought to oblige you  That is indeed obliging  Come give me your hand  Miss Harlowe  You  are  obliged to me I can tell you That And let us go down to Miss Horton  Excuse me I will not stir out of this room  Would you have me and Miss Horton dine in this filthy bedroom  It is not a bedroom to me I have not been in bed nor will while I am here  And yet you care not as I see to leave the house And so you won't go down  Miss Harlowe  I won't except I am forced to it  Well well let it alone I sha'n't ask Miss Horton to dine in this room I assure you I will send up a plate  And away the little saucy toad fluttered down  And when they had dined up they came together  Well Miss you would not eat any thing it seems Very pretty sullen airs theseNo wonder  the honest gen∣tleman had su  h a hand with you  She only held up her hands and eyes the tears trick∣ling down her cheeks  Insolent devilsHow much more cruel and insulting are bad women even than bad men  Methinks  Miss  said Sally you are a little  soily  to what we have seen you Pity such a nice lady should not have changes of apparel Why won't you send to your lodgings for linen at least  I am not nice now  Miss looks well and clean in any thing said Polly But dear Madam why won't you send to your lodgings It is but kind to the  people  They must have a concern about you And your Miss Howe will wonder what's be∣come of you for no doubt you correspond  She turned from them and to herself said  Too much Too much  She tossed her handkerchief wet before with her tears from her and held her apron to her eyes  Don't weep Miss said the vile Polly  Yet  do  cry'd the viler Sally if it be a relief Nothing as Mr Lovelace once told  me  dries sooner than tears For once I too wept mightily  I could not bear the recital of this with patience Yet I cursed them not so much as I should have done had I not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of their  gentle  treatment and this for two reasons the one that I might stab thee to the heart with the repetition the other that I might know upon what terms I am likely to see the unhappy lady tomorrow  Well but  Miss Harlowe  cry'd Sally do you think these  forlorn airs  pretty You are a good Christian child Mrs Rowland tells me she has got you a Biblebook O there it liesI make no doubt but you have doubled down the  useful places  as honest Matt Prior says  Then rising and taking it upAy so you haveThe  Book of Job  One opens naturally here I see  My  mam∣ma made me a fine biblescholar  Ecclesiasticus  too That's Apocrypha as they call itYou see Miss Hor∣ton I know something of the book  They proposed once more to bail her and to go home with them A motion which she received with the same indignation as before  Sally told her That she had written in a very favour∣able manner in her behalf to you and that she every hour expected an answer and made no doubt that you  would come up with the messenger and generously pay the whole debt and ask her pardon for neglecting it  This disturbed her so much that they feared she would have fallen into fits She could not bear your name she said She hoped she should never see you more And were you to intrude yourself dreadful consequences might follow  Surely they said she would be glad to be released from her confinement  Indeed she  should  now they had begun to alarm her with  his  name who was the author of all her woes And who she now saw plainly gave way to this new outrage in order to bring her to his own infamous terms  Why then they asked would she not write to her friends to pay Mrs Sinclair's demand  Because she hoped she should not long trouble any∣body and because she knew that the payment of the money if she were able to pay it was not what was aim∣ed at  Sally owned that she told her That truly she had thought herself as well descended and as well educated as herself tho' not intitled to such considerable fortunes And had the impudence to insist upon it to me to be truth  She had the insolence to add to the lady That she had as much reason as  she  to expect Mr Lovelace would mar∣ry her he having contracted to do so  before  he knew Miss Clarissa Harlowe And that she had it under his hand and seal tooor else he had not obtained his end Therefore it was not likely she should be so officious as to do his work against herself if she thought Mr Lovelace had de∣signs upon her like what she  presumed  to hint at That for her part her only view was to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman who made those things grievous to her which would not be made such a rout about by any∣body else and to procure the payment of a just debt to her friend Mrs Sinclair  She besought them to leave her She wanted not these instances she said to convince her of the company she was in And told them that to get rid of such visitors and of still worse that she apprehended she would write  to one friend to raise the money for her tho' it would be death for her to do so because that friend could not do it without her mother in whose eye it would give a selfish appearance to a friendship that was above all sordid alloys  They advised her to write out of hand  But how much must I write for What is the sum Should I not have had a bill delivered meGod knows I took not your lodgings But he that could treat me as he has done could do this  Don't speak against Mr Lovelace  Miss Harlowe  He is a man I greatly esteem Cursed toad And 'bating that he will take his advantage where he can of  Us  silly credulous girls he is a man of honour  She lifted up her hands and eyes instead of speaking▪ And well she might For any words she could have used could not have expressed the anguish she must feel on be∣ing comprehended in the US  She must write for one hundred and fifty guineas at least Two hundred if she were short of money might as well be written for  Mrs Sinclair she said had all her cloaths Let them be sold  fairly  sold and the money go as far as it would go She had also a few other valuables but no money none at all but the poor halfguinea and the little sil∣ver they had seen She would give bond to pay all that her apparel and the other matters she had would fall short of She had great effects belonging to her of right Her bond would and must be paid were it for a thou∣sand pounds But her cloaths she should never want She believed if not too much undervalued those and her few valuables would answer everything She wished for no surplus but to discharge the last expences and forty shillings would do as well for those as forty pounds Let my ruin said she lifting up her eyes be LARGE be COMPLETE  in this life  For a  composition  let it be COM∣PLETE And there she stopped No doubt alluding to her father's futurelyextended curse  The wretches could not help wishing to me for the op∣portunity of making such a purchace for their own wear How I cursed  them  and in my heart  thee  But too probable thought I that this vile Sally Martin may hope  Tho' thou art incapable of it that  her  Lovelace as she has the assurance behind thy back to call thee may pre∣sent her with some of the poor lady's spoils  Will not Mrs Sinclair proceeded she think my cloaths a security till they can be sold They are very good cloaths A suit or two but just put on as it were never worn They cost much more than is demanded of me  My father loved to see me fine  All shall go But let me have the particulars of her demand I suppose I must pay for my  destroyer  that was her welladapted word and his servants as well as for myselfI am content to do so Indeed I am content to do so I am above wishing that anybody who could  thus  act should be so much as expostulated with as to the justice and equity of it If I have but enough to pay the demand I shall be satisfied and will leave the baseness of such an action as this as an aggravation of a guilt which I thought could  not  be aggravated  I own Lovelace I have malice in this particularity in order to sting thee to the heart And let me ask thee What now thou canst think of thy barbarity thy unprece∣dented barbarity in having reduced a person of her rank fortune talents and virtue so low  The wretched women it must be owned act but in their profession a profession thou hast been the principal means of reducing these two to act in And they know what thy designs have been and how far prosecuted It is in their opinions using her  gently  that they have for∣born to bring to her the woman so justly odious to her and that they have not threatened her with the introducing to her strange men Nor yet brought into her company their  spiritbreakers  and  humblingdrones  fellows not allowed to carry stings to trace and force her back to their detested house and when there into all their measures  Till I came they thought thou wouldst not be dis∣pleased at anything she suffered that could help to mor∣tify her into a state of shame and disgrace and bring her to comply with thy views when thou shouldst come to release her from these wretches as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee  When thou considerest these things thou wilt make no  difficulty of believing that this their own account of their behaviour to this admirable lady has been far short of their insults And the less when I tell thee that all to∣gether their usage had such effects upon her that they left her in violent hysterics ordering an apothecary to be sent for if she should continue in them and be worse and particularly as they had done from the first that they kept out of her way any edged or pointed instrument especially a penknife which pretending to mend a pen they said she might ask for  At twelve Saturday night Rowland sent to tell them that she was so ill that he knew not what might be the issue and wished her out of his house  And this made them as heartily wish to hear from you For their messenger to their great surprize was not then returned from M Hall And they were sure he must have reached that place by Friday night  Early on Sunday morning both devils went to see how she did They had such an account of her weakness lowness and anguish that they forbore out of compas∣sion they said finding their visits so disagreeable to her to see her But their apprehension of what might be the issue was no doubt their principal consideration No∣thing else could have softened such flinty bosoms  They sent for the apothecary Rowland had had to her and gave him and Roland and his wife and maid paradeful injunctions for the utmost care to be taken of her No doubt with an OldBailey forecast And they sent up to let her know what orders they had given But that understanding she had taken something to compose herself they would not disturb her  She had scrupled it seems to admit the apothecary's visit overnight because he was a MANAnd could not be prevailed upon till they pleaded  their own safety  to her  They went again from church Lord Bob these creatures go to church But she sent them down word that she must have all the remainder of the day to herself  When I first came and told them of thy execrations for what they had done and joined my own to them they were astonished The mother said she had thought she had known Mr Lovelace better and expected thanks and not curses  While I was with them came back halting and curs∣ing most horribly their messenger by reason of the illusage he had received from you instead of the reward he had been taught to expect for the supposed good news that he carried down of the lady's being found out and securedA pretty fellow art thou not to abuse people for the consequences of thy own faults  Under what shocking disadvantages and with this ad∣dition to them that I am thy friend and intimate am I to make a visit to this unhappy lady tomorrow morning In thy  name  tooEnough to be refused that I am of a  sex  to which for  thy  sake she has so justifiable an aver∣sion Nor having such a tyrant of a father and such an implacable brother has she reason to make an exception in favour of  any  of it on  their  accounts  It is three o'clock I will close here and take a little rest What I have written will be a proper preparative for what shall offer byandby  Thy servant is not to return without a letter he tells me and that thou expectest him back in the morning Thou hast fellows enough where thou art at thy command If I find any difficulty in seeing the lady thy messenger shall post away with thisLet him look to broken bones and other consequences if what he carries answer not thy expectation But if I am admitted thou shalt have  this  and the result of my audience both together In the for∣mer case thou mayest send another servant to wait the next advices from  J BELFORD  LETTER XLI  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Monday July    ABOUT six this morning I went to Rowland's Mrs Sinclair was to follow me in order to dismiss the action but not to come in sight  Rowland upon inquiry told me that the lady was extremely ill and that she had desired not to let any∣body but his wife or maid come near her  I said I  must  see her I had told him my business overnight and I  must  see her  His wife went up But returned presently saying She could not get her to speak to her yet that her eyelids moved tho' she either would not or could not open them to look up at her  Oons woman said I the lady may be in a fit The lady may be dyingLet me go up Shew me the way  A horrid hole of a house in a alley they call a court stairs wretchedly narrow even to the firstfloor rooms And into a den they led me with broken walls which had been papered as I saw by a multitude of tacks and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads  The floor indeed was clean but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures and initials of names that had been the woful employment of wretches who had no other way to amuse themselves  A bed at one corner with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling because the curtain rings were broken off but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look tho' plaguily in tatters and the corners tied up in tassels that the rents in it might go no farther  The windows dark and doublebarred the tops boarded up to save mending and only a little fourpaned eylethole of a casement to let in air more however coming in at broken panes than could come in at That  Four old turkeyworked chairs burstenbottomed the stuffing staring out  An old tottering wormeaten table that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand than the table cost fifty years ago when new  On the mantlepiece was an iron shoveup candlestick with a lighted candle in it twinkle twinkle twinkle four of them I suppose for a peny  Near that on the same shelf was an old lookingglass cracked thro' the middle breaking out into a thousand points the crack given it perhaps in a rage by some poor creature to whom it gave the representation of his heart's woes in his face  The chimney had two halftiles in it on one side and one whole one on the other which shewed it had been in  better plight but now the very morter had followed the rest of the tiles in every other place and left the bricks bare  An old halfbarred stovegrate was in the chimney and in that a large stonebottle without a neck filled with baleful eugh as an evergreen withered southernwood and sweetbriar and sprigs of rue in flower  To finish the shocking description in a dark nook stood an old brokenbottomed cane couch without a squab or coverlid sunk at one corner and unmortised by the failing of one of its wormeaten legs which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support  And This thou horrid Lovelace was the bedchamber of the divine Clarissa  I had leisure to cast my eye on these things For going up softly the poor lady turned not about at our entrance nor till I spoke moved her head  She was kneeling in a corner of the room near the dismal window against the table on an old bolster as it seemed to be of the cane couch halfcovered with her handkerchief her back to the door which was only shut to No need of fastenings her arms crossed upon the table the forefinger of her righthand in her bible She had perhaps been reading in it and could read no longer Paper pens ink lay by her book on the table Her dress was white damask exceeding neat but her stays seemed not tightlaced I was told afterwards that her laces had been cut when she fainted away at her entrance into this cursed place and she had not been solicitous enough about her dress to send for others Her head∣dress was a little discomposed her charming hair in na∣tural ringlets as you have heretofore described it but a little tangled as if not lately kembed irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world as her disor∣dered rumpled handkerchief did the other Her face O how altered from what I had seen it Yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings was reclined when we entered upon her crossed arms but so as not more than one side of it to be hid  When I surveyed the room around and the kneeling  lady sunk with majesty too in herwhite flowing robes for she had not on a hoop spreading the dark tho' not dirty floor and illuminating that horrid corner her linen beyond imagination white considering that she had not been undressed ever since she had been here I thought my concern would have choaked me Something rose in my throat I know not what which made me for a moment guggle as it were for speech Which at last forcing its way ConConConfound you both said I to the man and woman is this an apartment for such a lady And could the cursed devils of her own sex who visited this suffering angel see her and leave her in so damned a nook  Sir we would have had the lady to accept of our own bedchamber but she refused it We are poor people And we expect nobody will stay with us longer than they can help it  You are people chosen purposely I doubt not by the damned woman who has employed you And if your usage of this lady has been but half as bad as your house you had better never to have seen the light  Up then raised the charming sufferer her lovely face but with such a significance of woe overspreading it that I could not for the soul of me help being visibly affected  She waved her hand two or three times towards the door as if commanding me to withdraw and displeased at my intrusion but did not  peak  Permit me MadamI will not approach one step farther without your leave Permit me for one moment the favour of your ear  NoNoGo go MAN with an emphasisAnd would have said more but as if struggling in vain for words she seemed to give up speech for lost and dropp'd her head down once more with a deep sigh upon her left arm her right as if she had not the use of it numb∣ed I suppose selfmoved dropping down on her side  O that thou hadst been there and in my placeBut by what I then felt in myself I am convinced that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellowcreatures is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart With what pleasure at that moment could I have given up my own life could I but first have avenged this charm∣ing  creature and cut the throat of her  destroyer  as she emphatically calls thee tho' the friend that I best love And yet at the same time my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness of which tho' not so hardened a wretch as thou it was never before so susceptible  I dare not approach you dearest Lady without your leave But on my knees I beseech you to permit me to release you from this damned house and out of the power of the accursed woman who was the occasion of your being here  She lifted up her sweet face once more and beheld me on my knees Never knew I before what it was to pray so heartily  Are you notAre you not Mr Belford Sir I think your name is Belford  It is Madam and I ever was a worshiper of your virtues and an advocate for you and I come to release you from the hands you are in  And in whose to place me O leave me leave me Let me never rise from this spot Let me never never more believe in man  This moment dearest Lady this very moment if you please you may depart whithersoever you think fit You are absolutely free and your own mistress  I had now as lieve die here in this place as anywhere I will owe no obligation to any friend of  him  in whose company you have seen me So pray Sir withdraw  Then turning to the officer Mr Rowland I think your name is I am better reconciled to your house than I was at first If you can but engage that I shall have nobody come near me but your wife no  Man  and neither of those women who have sported with my calamities I will die with you and in this very corner And you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me I have value enough for thatfor see I have a diamond ring taking it out of her bosom and I have friends will redeem it at a high price when I am gone  But for  you  Sir looking at me I beg you to with∣draw If you mean me well God I hope will reward you for your good meaning but to the friend of my  de∣stroyer  will I not owe an obligation  You will owe no obligation to me nor to anybody You have been detained for a debt you do not owe The action is dismissed and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach which stands as near to this house as it could draw up And I will either leave you at the coachdoor or attend you whithersoever you please till I see you safe where you would wish to be  Will you then Sir  compel  me to be beholden to you  You will inexpressibly oblige me Madam to com∣mand me to do you either service or pleasure  Why then Sirlooking at meBut why do you mock me in that humble posture Rise Sir I cannot speak to you else  I arose  Only Sir take this ring I have a sister who will be glad to have it at the price it shall be valued at for the  former  owner's sakeOut of the money she gives let this man be paid handsomely paid And I have a few valuables more at my lodgings Dorcas or the MAN William can tell where that is let them and my cloaths at the wicked woman's where you have seen me be sold for the payment of my lodging first and next of your  friend  's debts that I have been arrested for as far as they will go only reserving enough to put me into the ground anywhere or anyhow no matter Tell your friend I wish it may be enough to satisfy the whole demand but if it be not he must make it up himself or if he think fit to draw for it on Miss Howe she will re∣pay it and with interest if he insist upon it And this Sir if you promise to perform you will do me as you offer both pleasure and service And say you  will  and take the ring and withdraw If I want to say anything more to you you seem to be an humane man I will let you knowAnd so Sir God bless you  I approached her and was going to speak  Don't speak Sir Here's the ring  I stood off  And won  t you take it Won't you do this last office for meI have no other person to ask it of else believe me I would not request it of  you  But take it or not laying it upon the tableyou must withdraw Sir I am  very ill I would fain get a little rest if I could I find I am going to be bad again  And offering to rise she sunk down thro' excess of weakness and grief in a fainting fit  Why Lovelace wast thou not present thyselfWhy dost thou commit such villainies as even thou thyself art afraid to appear in and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with  The maid coming in just then the woman and she lifted her up on the decrepit couch and I withdrew with this Rowland who wept like a child and said he never in his life was so moved  Yet so hardened a wretch art thou that I question whe∣ther thou wilt shed a tear at my relation  They recovered her by hartshorn and water I went down mean while for the detestable woman had been below some time O how did I curse her I never before was so fluent in curses  She tried to wheedle me but I renounced her and after she had dismissed the action sent her away crying or pretending to cry because of my behaviour to her  You will observe that I did not mention one word to the lady about  you  I was afraid to do it For 'twas plain that she could not bear your name Your  friend  and the  company  you have seen me in were the words nearest to naming you she could speak And yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal this sordidlooking villainy  I sent up again by Rowland's wife when I heard that the lady was recovered beseeching her to quit that devilish place and the woman assured her that she was at full liberty to do so for that the action was dis∣missed  But she cared not to answer her And was so weak and low that it was almost as much out of her power as incli∣nation the woman told me to speak  I would have hastened away for my friend doctor H but the house is such a den and the room she was in such a hole that I was ashamed to be seen in it by a man of his reputation especially with a woman of such an appear∣ance and in such uncommon distress and I found there  was no prevailing on her to quit it for the peoples bed∣room which was neat and lightsome  The strong room she was in the wretches told me should have been in better order but that it was but the very morning that she was brought in that an unhappy man had quitted it for a more eligible prison no doubt since there could hardly be a worse  Being told that she desired not to be disturbed and seemed inclined to dose I took this opportunity to go to her lodgings in Coventgarden to which Dorcas who first discovered her there as Will was the setter from church had before given me a direction  The man's name is Smith a dealer in gloves snuff and such petty merchandize His wife the shopkeeper He a maker of the gloves they sell Honest people it seems  I thought to have got the woman with me to the lady but she was not within  I talked with the man and told him what had befallen the lady owing as I said to a mistake of orders and gave her the character she deserved and desired him to send his wife the moment she came in to the lady di∣recting him whither not doubting that her attendance would be very welcome to her Which he promised  He told me that a letter was left for her there on Sa∣turday and about half an hour before I came another superscribed by the same hand the first by the post the other by a countryman who having been informed of her absence and of all the circumstances they could tell him of it posted away full of concern saying that the lady he was sent from would be ready to break her heart at the tidings  I thought it right to take the two letters back with me and dismissing my coach took a chair as a more proper vehicle for the lady if I the friend of her  destroyer  could prevail upon her to leave Rowland's  And here being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation I will make thee taste a little in thy turn of the plague of suspense and break off without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings I know that those least bear disappointment who love most to give it In twenty instances hast thou afforded  me proof of the truth of this observation And I matte  not thy raving  Another letter however shall be ready send for it as soon as thou wilt But were it not have I not written enough to convince thee that I am  Thy ready and obliging friend  J BELFORD  LETTER XLII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday July    eleven at night  CURSE upon thy hard heart thou vile caitiff How hast thou tortured me by thy designed  abruption  'Tis impossible that Miss Harlowe should have ever suf∣fered as thou hast made me suffer and as I now suffer  That Sex is made to bear pain It is a curse that the first of it intailed upon all her succeeding daughters when she brought the curse upon us all And they love those best whether man or child who give them mostBut to stretch upon thy damned tenterhooks such a spirit as mineNo rack no torture can equal my torture  And must I still wait the return of another messenger Confound thee for a malicious devil I wish thou wert a posthorse and I upon the back of thee How would I whip and spur and harrow up thy clumsy sides till I made thee a readyroasted readyflayed mess of dog's meat all the

tormenting scribble Dispatch him away with it Thou hast promised it shall be ready Every cushion or chair I shall sit upon the bed I shall lie down upon if I go to bed till he return will be stuffed with boltupright awls bodkins corkingpins and packingneedles Already I can fancy that to pink my body like my mind I need only to be put into a hogshead stuck full of steelpointed spikes and rolled down a hill three times as high as the Monument  But I lose time yet know not how to employ it till this fellow returns with the sequel of thy soulharrowing intelligence  LETTER XLIII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Mondaynight July    ON my return to Rowland's I found that the apo∣thecary was just gone up Mrs Rowland being above with him I made the less scruple to go up too as it was probable that to ask for leave would be to ask to be denied hoping also that the letters I had with me would be a good excuse  She was sitting on the side of the broken couch ex∣tremely weak and low and I observed cared not to speak to the man and no wonder for I never saw a more shocking fellow of a profession tolerably genteel nor heard a more illiterate one pratePhysician in ordinary to this house and others like it I suppose He put me in mind of Otway's apothecary in his Caius Marius  Meagre and very rueful were his looks  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones  Famine in his cheeks  Need and oppression staring in his eyes  Contempt and beggary hanging on his back  The world no friend of his nor the world's law  As I am in black he took me at my entrance I believe to be a doctor and slunk behind me with his hat upon his two thumbs and looked as if he expected the oracle to open and give him orders  The lady looked displeased as well at me as at Row∣land who followed me and at the apothecary It was not she said the least of her present misfortunes that she could not be left to her own sex and to her option to see whom she pleased  I besought her excuse and winking for the apothe∣cary to withdraw which he did told her that I had been at her new lodgings to order everything to be got  ready for her reception presuming she would choose to go thither That I had a chair at the door That Mr Smith and his wife I named their names that she should not have room for the least fear of Sinclair's had been full of apprehensions for her safety That I had brought two letters which were left there for her one by the post the other that very morning  This took her attention She held out her charming hand for them took them and pressing them to her lipsFrom the only friend I have in the world said she kissing them again and looking at the seals as if to see whether they had been opened I can't read them said she my eyes are too dim and put them in her bosom  I besought her to think of quitting that wretched hole  Where could she go she asked to be safe and uninter∣rupted for the short remainder of her life and to avoid being again visited by the creatures who had insulted her before  I gave her the solemnest assurances that she should not be invaded in her new lodgings by anybody and said that I would particularly engage my honour that  the person who had most offended her should not come near her without her own consent  Your  honour Sir Are you not that man's friend  I am not a friend Madam to his vile actions to the  most excellent of women  Do you flatter me Sir Then are you a MANBut Oh Sir your friend holding her face forward with great earnestness your  barbarous  friend what has he not to answer for  There she stopt Her heart full and putting her hand over her eyes and forehead the tears trickled thro' her fingers Resenting thy barbarity it seemed as Caesar did the stab from his distinguished Brutus  Tho' she was so very much disordered I thought I would not lose this opportunity to assert your innocence of this villainous arrest  There is no defending the unhappy man in any of his vile actions by you Madam but of this last outrage by all that's good and sacred he is innocent  O wretches what a Sex is yoursHave you all one  dialect  Good and sacred  If Sir you can find an oath or a vow or an adjuration that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with then speak it and I may again believe a MAN  I was excessively touched at these words knowing thy baseness and the reason she had for them  But say you Sir for I would not methinks have the wretch capable of this sordid basenessSay you that he is innocent of this  last  wickedness Can you  truly  say that he is  By the great God of Heaven  Nay Sir if you swear I must doubt youIf you yourself think your WORD insufficient what reliance can I have on your OATH O that this my experience had not cost me so dear But were I to live a  thousand  years I would always suspect the veracity of a swearer Ex∣cuse me Sir but is it likely that  he  who makes so free with his GOD will scruple anything that may serve his turn with his  fellowcreature  This was a most affecting reprimand  Madam said I I have a regard a regard a gentleman  ought  to have to my word and whenever I forfeit it to you  Nay Sir don't be angry with me It is grievous to me to question a gentleman's veracity But your friend calls himself a  gentleman  You know not what I have suffered by a  gentleman  And then again she wept  I would give you Madam demonstration if your griefs and your weakness would permit it that he has no hand in this barbarous baseness And that he resents it as it ought to be resented  Well well Sir with quickness he will have his ac∣count to make up somewhere else not to me I should not be sorry to find him able to acquit his intention on this occasion Let him know Sir only one thing that when you heard me in the bitterness of my spirit most vehemently exclaim against the undeserved usage I have met with from him that even  then  in  that  passionate mo∣ment I was able to say and never did I see such an ear∣nest and affecting exaltation of hands and eyes Give him good God repentance and amendment that I  may be the last poor creature who shall be ruined by himAnd in thy own good time receive to  thy  mercy the poor wretch who had  none  on me  By my soul I could not speak She had not her Bible before her for nothing  I was forced to turn my head away and to take out my handkerchief  What an angel is this Even the gaoler and his wife and maid wept  Again I wish thou hadst been there that thou mightst have sunk down at her feet and begun that moment to reap the effect of her generous wishes for thee unde∣serving as thou art of anything but perdition  I represented to her that she would be less free where she was from visits she liked not than at her own lodg∣ing I told her that it would probably bring her in particular  one visitor  who otherwise I would engage but I durst not swear again after the severe reprimand she had just given me should not come near her with∣out her consent And I expressed my surprize that she should be unwilling to quit such a place as this when it was more than probable that some of her friends when it was known how bad she was would visit her  She said the place when she was first brought into it was indeed very shocking to her But that she had found herself so weak and ill and her griefs had so sunk her that she did not expect to have lived till now That there∣fore all places had been alike to her for to die in a pri∣son  was  to die and equally eligible as to die in a pa∣lace palaces she said could have no attractions for a dying person But that since she feared she was not so soon to be released as she had hoped since she was so little mistress of herself  here  and since she might by re∣moval be in the way of her dear friend's letters she would hope that she might depend upon the assurances I gave her of being at liberty to return to her last lodg∣ings otherwise she would provide herself with new ones out of my knowlege as well as out of yours and that I was too much of a gentleman to be concerned in car∣rying her back to the house she had so much reason to abhor and to which she had been once before most vilely betrayed to her ruin  I assured her in the strongest terms  but swore not  that you were resolved not to molest her And as a proof of the sincerity of my professions besought her to give me directions in pursuance of my friend's express desire about sending all her apparel and whatever belonged to her to her new lodgings  She seemed pleased and gave me instantly out of her pocket her keys asking me If Mrs Smith whom I had named might not attend me and she would give  her  further directions To which I chearfully assented and then she told me that she would accept of the chair I had offered her  I withdrew and took the opportunity to be civil to Rowland and his maid for she found no fault with their behaviour for what they  were  and the fellow seems to be miserably poor I sent also for the apothecary who is as poor as the gaoler and still poorer I dare say as to the skill required in his business and satisfied him be∣yond his hopes  The lady after I had withdrawn attempted to read the letters I brought her But she could read but a little way in one of them and had great emotions upon it  She told the woman she would take a speedy oppor∣tunity to acknowlege their civiliti  s and to satisfy the apothecary who might send her his bill to her lodgings  She gave the maid something probably the only halfguinea she had And then with difficulty her limbs trem∣bling under her and supported by Mrs Rowland got down stairs  I offered my arm She was pleased to lean upon it I doubt Sir sa  d she as she moved I have behaved rudely to you But if you knew all you would forgive me  I know enough Madam to convince me that there is not such purity and honour in any woman upon earth nor any one that has been so barbarously treated  She looked at me very earnestly What she thought I cannot say but in general I never saw so much soul in a lady's eyes as in hers  I ordered my servant whose mourning made him less observable as such and who had not been in the lady's eye to keep the chair in view and to bring me word  how she did when set down The fellow had the thought to step into the shop just before the chair entered it under pretence of buying snuff and so enabled himself to give me an account that she was received with great joy by the good woman of the house who told her she was but just come in and was preparing to attend her in HighHolborn O Mrs Smith said she as soon at she saw her did you not think I was run awayYou don't know what I have suffered since I saw you I have been in a pri∣sonArrested for debts I owe notBut thank God I am hereWill you permit your maidI have forgot her name already  Katharine Madam  Will you let Katharine assist me to bed I have not had my cloaths off since Thursday night  What she further said the fellow heard not she leaning upon the maid and going upstairs  But dost thou not observe what a strange what an uncommon openness of heart reigns in this lady  She had been in a prison  she said before a stranger in the shop and before the maidservant And so probably she would have said had there been twenty people in the shop  The disgrace she cannot hide from  herself  as she says in her letter to Lady Betty she is not solicitous to con∣ceal from the  world  But this makes it evident to me that she is resolved to keep no terms with thee And yet to be able to put up such a prayer for thee as she did in her prison I will often mention the  prisonroom  to teaze thee Does not this shew that revenge has very little sway in her mind tho' she can retain so much proper resentment  And this is another excellence in this admirable wo∣man's character For whom before her have we met with in the whole sex or in ours either that know how in  practice  to distinguish between REVENGE and RESENT∣MENT for base and ingrateful treatment  'Tis a cursed thing after all that such a woman as this should be treated as she has been treated Hadst thou been a king and done as thou  hast  done by such a meritorious in∣nocent I believe in my heart it would have been adjudged to be a national sin and the sword the pestilence or fa∣mine  must have atoned for itBut as thou art a private man thou wilt certainly meet with thy punishment besides what thou mayest expect from the justice of thy country and the vengeance of her friends as she will her reward HEREAFTER  It  must  be so if there be really such a thing as  future Remuneration  as now I am more and more convinced there mustElse what a hard fate is hers whose pu∣nishment to all appearance has so much exceeded her fault And as to thine how can  temporary  burnings wert thou by some accident to be consumed in thy bed expiate for thy abominable vileness to her in breach of all obligations moral and divine  I was resolved to lose no time in having everything which belonged to the lady at the cursed woman's sent her Accordingly I took coach to Smith's and procured the lady to whom I sent up my compliments and inqui∣ries how she bore her removal ill as she sent me down word she was to give proper directions to Mrs Smith▪ Whom I took with me to Sinclair's and who saw every∣thing looked out and put into the trunks and boxes they were first brought in and carried away in two coaches  Had I not been there Sally and Polly would each of them have taken to herself something of the poor lady's spoils This they declared And I had something to do to get from Sally a fine Brusselslace head which she had the confidence to say she would wear for  Miss Harlowe  's sake Nor should either I or Mrs Smith have known she had got it had she not been in search after the ruffles be∣longing to it  My resentment on this occasion and the conversation which Mrs Smith and I had in which I not only expa∣tiated upon the merits of the lady but expressed my con∣cern for her sufferings tho' I left her room to suppose her married yet without averring it gave me high credit with the good woman So that we are perfectly wellacquainted already By which means I shall be enabled to give you accounts from time to time of all that passes and which I will be very industrious to do provided I may depend upon the solemn promises I have given the lady in your name as well as my own that she shall be free from all personal molestation from you And thus shall I have  it in my power to return  in kind  your writing favours and preserve my shorthand besides Which till this corre∣spondence was opened I had pretty much neglected  I ordered the abandoned women to make out your ac∣count They answered  That  they would do with a  ven∣geance  Indeed they breathe nothing but revenge For now they say you will assuredly marry and your exam∣ple will be followed by all your friends and companions As the old one says to the utter ruin of her poor house  LETTER XLIV  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday Morn July    o'clock  HAving sat up late to finish and seal up in readiness my letter to the above period I am disturbed before I wished to have risen by the arrival of thy second fellow man and horse in a foam  While he baits I will write a few lines most heartily to congratulate thee on thy  expected  rage and impatience and on thy recovery of mental feeling  How much does the idea thou givest me of thy deserved torments by thy upright awls bodkins pins and pack∣ingneedles by thy rolling hogshead with iron spikes and by thy macerated sides delight me  I will upon every occasion that offers drive more spikes into thy hogshead and roll thee downhill and up as thou recoverest to sense or rather returnest back to  senselesness  Thou knowest therefore the terms on which thou art to enjoy my correspondence Am not I who have all along and  in time  protested against thy barbarous and ingrateful perfidies to a lady so noble in∣titled to drive remorse if possible into thy hithertocal∣lous heart  Only let me reinforce one thing which perhaps I mentioned too slightly before That the lady was pre∣vailed upon by my solemn assurances  only  that she might depend upon being free from  your  visits not to remove to new lodgings where neither you nor I should be able to find her  These assurances I thought I might give her not only because of your promise but because it is necessary for  you to know where she is in order to address yourself to her by your friends  Enable me therefore to make good to her this my so∣lemn engagement or adieu to all friendship at least to all correspondence with thee for ever  J BELFORD  LETTER XLV  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday July    Afternoon  I Renewed my inquiries after the lady's health in the morning by my servant And as soon as I had dined I went myself  I had but a poor account of it Yet sent up my com∣pliments She returned me thanks for all my good of∣fices and her excuses that they could not be  personal  just then being very low and faint But if I gave myself the trouble of coming about six this evening she should be able she hoped to drink a dish of tea with me and would then thank me herself  I am very proud of this condescension and think it looks not amiss for you as I am your  avowed  friend Methinks I want fully to remove from her mind all doubts of you in this last villainous action And who knows then what your noble relations may be able to do for you with her if you hold your mind For your ser∣vant acquainted me with their having actually engaged Miss Howe in their and your favour before this cursed affair happened And I desire the particulars of all from yourself that I may the better know how to serve you  She has two handsome apartments a bedchamber and diningroom with light closets in each She has already a nurse the people of the house having but one maid a woman whose care diligence and honesty Mrs Smith highly commends She has likewise the benefit of the voluntary attendance and  love  as it seems of a widow gentlewoman Mrs Lovick her name who lodges over her apartment and of whom she seems very fond having found something in her she thinks resembling the qua∣lities of her worthy Mrs Norton  About seven o' clock this morning it seems the lady was so ill that she yielded to their desires to have an apo∣thecary sent forNot the fellow thou mayst believe she had had before at Rowland's but one Mr Goddard a man of skill and eminence and of conscience too de∣monstrated as well by general character as by his pre∣scriptions to this lady For pronouncing her case to be grief he ordered for the present only innocent julaps by way of cordial and as soon as her stomach should be able to bear it light kitchendiet telling Mrs Lovick that That with air moderate exercise and chearful com∣pany would do her more good than all the medicines in his shop  This has given me as it seems it has the lady who also praises his modest behaviour paternal looks and genteel address a very good opinion of the man and I design to make myself acquainted with him and if he advises to call in a doctor to wish him for the fair patient's sake more than the physician's who wants not practice my worthy friend Dr Hwhose character is above all ex∣ception as his humanity I am sure will distinguish him to the lady  Mrs Lovick gratified me with an account of a letter she had written from the lady's mouth to Miss Howe she be∣ing unable to write herself with steadiness It was to this effect in answer it seems to her two letters whatever were the contents of them  That she had been involved in a dreadful calamity which she was sure when known would exempt her from the effects of her friendly displeasure for not an∣swering her first having been put under an arrest Could she have believed it That she was released but the day before And was now so weak and so low that she was obliged to get a widow gentlewoman in the same house to account thus for her silence to her two letters of the th and th That she would as soon as able answer them Begged of her mean time not to be uneasy for her since only that this was a calamity which came upon her when she was far from being well a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch ready before to sink under too heavy a burden  it was nothing to the evil she had before suffered And one felicity seemed likely to issue from it which was that she should be at rest in an honest house with considerate and kindhearted people having assurance given her that she should not be molested by the wretch whom it would be death for her to see So that now she Miss Howe needed not to send to her by private and ex∣pensive conveyances Nor need Collins to take precau∣tions for fear of being dogged to her lodgings nor she to write by a fictitious name to her but by her own  You see I am in a way to oblige you You see how much she depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude yourself into her company Let not your flaming impatience destroy all and make me look like a villain to a lady who has reason to suspect  every man she sees  to be so Upon this condition you may ex∣pect all the services that can flow from true friendship and from  Your sincere Wellwisher  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER XLVI  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday night July    I AM just come from the lady I was admitted into the diningroom where she was sitting in an elbowchair in a very weak and low way She made an effort to stand up when I entered but was forced to keep her seat You'll excuse me Mr Belford I ought to rise to thank you for all your kindness to me I was to blame to be so loth to leave that sad place for I am in Heaven here to what I was there And good people about me tooI have not had good people about me for a long long time before so that with a halfsmile I had begun to wonder whither they were all gone  Her nurse and Mrs Smith who were present took oc∣casion to retire And when we were alone You seem to be a person of humanity Sir said she You hinted as I was leaving  my prison  that you were not a stranger to my sad story If you know it  truly  you must know that I have  been most barbarously treated and have not deserved it at the man's hands by whom I have suffered  I told her I knew enough to be convinced that she had the merit of a saint and the purity of an angel And was proceeding when she said No flighty compliments No undue attributes Sir I offered to plead for my sin∣cerity and mentioned the word  Politeness  and would have distinguished between That and  Flattery  Nothing can be polite said she that is not just Whatever I  may  have had I have  now  no vanity to gratify  I disclaimed all intention of compliment All I  had  said and what I  should  say was and should be the effect of sincere veneration My unhappy friend's account of her had intitled her to That  I then mentioned your grief your penitence your re∣solutions of making her all the amends that were possible now to be made her And in the most earnest manner I asserted your innocence as to the last villainous outrage  Her answer was to this effect It is painful to me to think of him The amends you talk of cannot be made This last violence you speak of is nothing to what pre∣ceded it That cannot be atoned for nor palliated This may And I shall not be sorry to be convinced that he cannot be guilty of so very low a wickednessYet after his vile forgeries of handsafter his personating base∣nesseswhat are the iniquities he is not capable of  I would then have given her an account of the tryal you stood with your friends Your own previous resolu∣tions of marriage had she honoured you with the re∣quested  four words  All your family's earnestness to have the honour of her alliance And the application of your two cousins to Miss Howe by general consent for that young lady's interest with her But having just touched upon these topics she cut me short saying That was a cause before another tribunal Miss Howe's letters to her were upon that subject and she should write her thoughts to  her  assoon as she was able  I then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile Sinclair's officious arrest a point she had the generosity to  wish  you cleared of And hav∣ing mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to  me on this occasion she asked If I had that letter about me  I owned I had  She wished to see it  This puzzled me horribly For you must needs think that most of the free things which among us Rakes pass for wit and spirit must be shocking stuff to the ears or eyes of persons of delicacy of that sex And then such an air of levity runs thro' thy most serious letters such a false bravery endeavouring to carry off ludicrously the subjects that most affect thee that those letters are generally the least fit to be seen which ought to be most to thy credit  Something like this I observed to her and would fain have excused myself from shewing it But she was so ear∣nest that I undertook to read some parts of it resolving to omit the most exceptionable  I know thou'lt curse me for that but I thought it bet∣ter to oblige her than to be suspected myself and so not have it in my power to serve thee with her when so good a foundation was laid for it and when she knows as bad of thee as I can tell her  Thou remembrest the contents I suppose of thy furi∣ous letter  See p    Her remarks upon the different parts of it which I read to her were to the following effect  Upon thy two first lines  All undone undone by Jupi∣ter Zounds Jack what shall I do now A curse upon all my plots and contrivances  thus she expressed herself  O how light how unaffected with the sense of its own crimes is the heart that could dictate to the pen this libertine froth  The paragraph which mentions the vile arrest affected her a good deal  In the next I omitted thy curse upon thy relations whom thou wert gallanting And read on the seven sub∣sequent paragraphs down to thy execrable wish which was too shocking to read to her What I read produced the following reflections from her  The plots and contrivances which he curses and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out shew me that all his guilt was premeditated Nor doubt  I that his dreadful perjuries and inhuman arts as he went along were to pass for fine stratagems for witty sport and to demonstrate a superiority of inventive ta∣lentsO my cruel cruel brother had it not been for thee I had not been thrown upon so pernicious and so despicable a plotterBut proceed Sir pray proceed  At that part  Canst thou O fatal prognosticator tell me where my punishments will end  she sighed And when I came to that sentence  Praying for my reformation perhaps  Is that there said she sighing againWretch∣ed manAnd shed a tear for theeBy my faith Love∣lace I believe she hates thee not She has at least a concern a generous concern for thy future happiness What a noble creature hast thou injured  She made a very severe reflection upon me on read∣ing these words  On your knees for me beg her pardon    You had all your lessons Sir said she when you came to redeem me You was so condescending as to kneel I thought it was the effect of your own humanity and goodnatured earnestness to serve me Excuse me Sir I knew not that it was in consequence of a prescribed lesson  This concerned me not a little I could not bear to be thought such a wretched puppet such a Joseph Leman such a Tomlinson I endeavoured therefore with some warmth to clear myself of this reflection and she again asked my excuse  I was avowedly she said the friend of a man whose friendship she had reason to be sorry to say was no credit to anybody  And desired me to proceed I did but fared not much better after∣wards For  On that passage where you say  I had always been her friend and advocate  This was her unanswerable remark  I find Sir by this expression that he had always de∣signs against me and that you all along knew that he had Would to Heaven you had had the goodness to have contrived some way that might not have endan∣gered your own safety to give me notice of his base∣ness since you approved not of it But you gentlemen I suppose had rather see an innocent fellowcreature ruined than be thought capable of an action which  however generous might be likely to loosen the bands of a wicked friendship  After this severe but just reflection I would have avoided reading the following altho' I had unawares begun the sentence but she held me to it  What would I now give had I permitted you to have been a successful advocate  And this was her remark upon it  So Sir you see if you had been the happy means of preventing the evils de∣signed me you would have had your friend's thanks for it when he came to his consideration This satis∣faction I am persuaded everyone in the long run will enjoy who has the virtue to withstand or prevent a wicked purpose I was obliged  I see  to your kind wishesBut it was a point of honour with you to keep his secret the greater honour perhaps the viler the secret Yet permit me to wish Mr Belford that you were ca∣pable of relishing the pleasures that arise to a benevolent mind from VIRTUOUS friendshipNone  other  is wor∣thy of the sacred name You seem an humane man I hope for your own sake you will one day experience the difference And when you do think of Miss Howe and Clarissa Harlowe I find you know much of my sad story who were the happiest creatures on earth in each other's friendship till this friend of yours  And there she stopt and turned from me  Where thou callest thyself  A villainous plotter  To take crime to himself said she without shame O what a hardened wretch is this man  On that passage where thou sayest  Let me know how she has been treated If roughly woe be to the guilty  this was her remark with an air of indignation  What a man is your friend SirIs such a one as  he  to set him∣self up to punish the guilty All the  rough  usage I could receive from them was infinitely  less  And there she stopt a moment or two Then proceeding  And who shall punish  him  What an assuming wretch Nobody but  himself  is intitled to injure the innocent He is I suppose on earth to act the part which the malignant fiend is supposed to act below Dealing out punishments at his pleasure to every inferior instru∣ment of mischief  What thought I have I been doing I shall have this savage fellow think I have been playing him booty in reading part of his letter to this sagacious lady Yet if thou art angry it can only in reason be at thyself for who would think I might not communicate to her some of the least exceptionable parts of a letter as a proof of thy sincerity in exculpating thyself from a criminal charge which thou wrotest to thy friend to convince  him  of thy innocence But a bad heart and a bad cause are confound∣ing things And so let us put it to its proper account  I passed over thy charge to me to curse them by the hour and thy names of  Dragon  and  Serpents  tho' so ap∣plicable since had I read them thou must have been supposed to know from the first what creatures they were vile fellow as thou wert for bringing so much purity among them And I closed with thy own concluding pa∣ragraph  A line A line A kingdom for a line  c How∣ever telling her since she saw that I omitted some sen∣tences that there were further vehemences in it but as they were better fitted to shew to me the sincerity of the writer than for so delicate an ear as hers to hear I chose to pass them over  You have read enough said she He is a wicked wicked manI see he intended to have me in his power at any rate and I have no doubt of what his purposes were by what his actions have been You know his vile Tomlinson I supposeyou knowBut what signi∣fies talkingNever was there such a premeditately false heart in man  Nothing can be truer thought I  What has he not vowed What has he not invented And all for whatOnly to ruin a poor young creature whom he ought to have protected and whom he had first de∣prived of all other protection  She arose and turned from me her handkerchief at her eyes And after a pause came towards me again  I hope said she I talk to a man who has a better heart And I thank you Sir for all your kind tho' ineffectual pleas in my favour formerly whether the motives for them were compassion or principle or both That they  were  ineffectual might very probably be owing to your want of earnestness and  that  as  you  might think to my want of merit I might not in your eye  deserve  to be savedI might appear to you a giddy creature who had run away from her true and natural friends and who therefore ought to take the consequence of the lot she had drawn  I was afraid for thy sake to let her know how  very  earnest I had been But assured her that I had been her zealous friend and that my motives were founded upon a merit that I believed was never equalled That however indefensible Mr Lovelace was he had always done justice to her virtue That to a full conviction of her untainted honour it was owing that he so earnestly desired to call so inestimable a jewel his And was pro∣ceeding when she again cut me short  Enough and too much of this subject SirIf he will never more let me behold his face that is all I have now to ask of himIndeed indeed clasping her hands  I never will  if I can by any means not criminally de∣sperate avoid it  What could I say for theeThere was no room how∣ever  at that time  to touch this string again for fear of bringing upon myself a prohibition not only of the sub∣ject but of ever attending her again  I gave some distant intimations of moneymatters I should have told thee that when I read to her that pass∣age where thou biddest me force what sums upon her I can get her to takeshe repeated No no no no seve∣ral times with great quickness and I durst no more than just intimate it againand that so darkly as left her room to seem not to understand me  Indeed I know not the person man or woman I should be so much afraid of disobliging or incurring a censure from as from her She has so much true dignity in her manner without pride or arrogance which in those who have either one is tempted to mortify such a piercing eye yet softened so sweetly with rays of benignity that she commands all one's reverence  Methinks I have a kind of holy love for this angel of a woman and it is matter of astonishment to me that thou couldst converse with her a quarter of an hour together and hold thy devilish purposes  Guarded as she was by piety prudence virtue dignity family fortune and a purity of heart that never woman before her boasted what a true devil must he be yet I doubt I shall make thee proud who could resolve to break thro' so many fences  For my own part I am more and more sensible that I ought not to have contented myself with  representing against  and  expostulating with thee upon  thy base inten∣tions And indeed I had it in my head more than once to try to do something for her But wretch that I was I was withheld by notions of false honour as she justly reproached me because of thy own  voluntary  communi∣cations to me of thy purposes And then as she was brought into such a cursed house and was so watched by thyself as well as by thy infernal agents I thought knowing my man that I should only accelerate the in∣tended mischiefsMoreover finding thee so much over∣awed by her virtue that thou hadst not at thy  first  carry∣ing her thither the courage to attempt her and that she had more than once without knowing thy base views obliged thee to abandon them and to resolve to do her justice and thyself honour I hardly doubted that her merit would be triumphant at last  It is my opinion if thou holdest thy purposes to marry that thou canst not do better than to procure thy real aunts and thy real cousins to pay her a visit and to be thy advocates But if they decline personal visits letters from them and from my Lord M supported by Miss Howe's interest may perhaps effect something in thy favour  But these are only my hopes founded on what I  wish  for thy sake The lady I really think would choose death rather than thee And the two women are of opi∣nion tho' they know not half of what she has suffered that her heart is actually broken  At taking my leave I tendered my best services to her and besought her to permit me frequently to inquire after her health  She made me no answer but by bowing her head  LETTER XLVII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday July    THIS morning I took chair to Smith's and being told that the lady had a very bad night but was up I sent for her worthy apothecary who on his com∣ing to me approving of my proposal of calling in Dr H I bid the women acquaint her with the designed visit  It seems she was at first displeased yet withdrew her objection But after a pause asked them What she should do She had effects of value some of which she intended as soon as she  could  to turn into money but till then had not a single guinea to give the Doctor for his fee  Mrs Lovick said she had five guineas by her They were at her service  She would accept of three she said if she would take  that  pulling a diamond ring from her finger till she re∣paid her but on no other terms  Having been told I was below with Mr Goddard she desired to speak one word with me before she saw the Doctor  She was sitting in an elbowchair leaning her head on a pillow Mrs Smith and the widow on each side her chair her nurse with a phial of hartshorn behind her in her own hand her salts  Raising her head at my entrance she inquired If the Doctor knew Mr Lovelace  I told her No and that I believed you never saw him in your life  Was the Doctor my friend  He was and a very worthy and skilful man I named him for his eminence in his profession And Mr Goddard said he knew not a better physician  I have but one condition to make before I see the gentleman that he refuse not his fees from me If I am poor Sir I am proud I will not be under obli∣gation You may  believe  Sir I will not I suffer this visit because I would not appear ingrateful to the few friends I have left nor obstinate to such of my relations  as may some time hence for their private satisfaction inquire after my behaviour in my sick hours So Sir you know the condition And don't let me be vexed I am very ill and cannot debate the matter  Seeing her so determined I told her If it must be so it should  Then Sir the gentleman may come But I shall not be able to answer many questions Nurse you can tell him at the window there what a night I have had and how I have been for two days past And Mr Goddard if he be here can let him know what I have taken Pray let me be as little questioned as possible  The Doctor paid his respects to her with the gentle∣manly address for which he is noted And she cast up her sweet eyes to him with that benignity which accom∣panies her every graceful look  I would have retired but she forbid it  He took her hand the lily not of so beautiful a white Indeed Madam you are very low said he But give me leave to say That you can do more for yourself than all the faculty can do for you  He then withdrew to the window And after a short conference with the women he turned to me and to Mr Goddard at the other window We can do nothing here speaking low but by cordials and nourishment What friends has the lady She seems to be a person of condi∣tion and ill as she is a very fine womanA single lady I presume  I whisperingly told him she was That there were ex∣traordinary circumstances in her case as I would have ap∣prised him had I met with him yesterday That her friends were very cruel to her but that she could not hear them named without reproaching herself tho' they were much more to blame than she  I knew I was right said the Doctor A lovecase Mr Goddard A lovecase Mr Belford There is one per∣son in the world who can do her more service than all the faculty  Mr Goddard said he had apprehended her disorder was in her mind and had treated her accordingly And then told the Doctor what he had done Which he approving  of again taking her charming hand said My good young Lady you will require very little of our assistance You must in a great measure be your own doctress Come  dear  Madam Forgive me the familiar tenderness your aspect commands love as well as reverence and a father of children some of them older than yourself may be excused for them chear up your spirits Resolve to do all in your power to be well and you'll soon grow better  You are very kind Sir said she I will take whatever you direct My spirits have been hurried I shall be better I believe before I am worse The care of my good friends here looking at the women shall not meet with an ingrateful return  The Doctor wrote He would fain have declined his fee As her malady he said was rather to be relieved by the soothings of a friend than by the prescriptions of a physician he should think himself greatly honoured to be admitted rather to  advise  her in the  one  character than to  prescribe  to her in the  other  She answered That she should be always glad to see so humane a gentleman That his visits would  keep her in charity with his sex  But that were she to  forget  that he was her  physician  she might be apt to abate of the con∣fidence in his skill which might be necessary to effect the amendment that was the end of his visits  And when he urged her still further which he did in a very polite manner and as passing by the door two or three times a day she said she should always have pleasure in considering him in the kind light he  offered himself to her  That  that  might be very generous in one person to offer which would be as ungenerous in another to accept That indeed she was not at present high in circumstance and he saw by the tender which he  must  accept of that she had greater respect to  her own convenience  than to  his merit  or than to the  pleasure  she should take in his visits  We all withdrew together and the Doctor and Mr Goddard having a great curiosity to know something more of her story at the motion of the latter we went into a neighbouring coffeehouse and I gave them in confi∣dence a brief relation of it making all as light for you as I could and yet you'll suppose that in order to do but  common justice to the lady's character heavy must be that light  Three o' clock afternoon  I JUST now called again at Smith's and am told she is somewhat better which she attributed to the soothings of her Doctor She expressed herself highly pleased with both gentlemen and said that their behaviour to her was perfectly  paternal    Paternal  poor lady Never having been till very lately from under her parents wings and now abandon'd by all her friends she is for finding out something  pater∣nal  and  maternal  in every one the latter qualities in Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith to supply to herself the father and mother her dutiful heart pants after  Mrs Smith told me that after we were gone she gave the keys of her trunks and drawers to her and the widow Lovick and desired them to take an inventory of them which they did in her presence  They also informed me That she had requested them to find her a purchaser for two rich dress'd suits one never worn the other not above once or twice  This shock'd me exceedingly  Perhaps it may thee a little  Her reason for so doing she told them was That she should never live to wear them That her sister and other relations were above wearing them That her mother would not endure in her sight anything that was hers That she wanted the money That she would not be obliged to anybody when she had effects by her which she had no occasion for And yet said she I expect not that they will fetch a price answerable to their value  They were both very much concerned as they own'd and asked my advice upon it And the richness of her ap∣parel having given them a still higher notion of her rank than they had before they supposed she must be of quality and again wanted to know her story  I told them That she was indeed a lady of family and fortune I still gave them room to suppose her married But left it to her to tell them all in her own time and manner All I would say was That she had been very vilely treated deserved it not and was all innocence and purity  You may suppose that they both expressed their asto∣nishment that there could be a man in the world who could illtreat so fine a creature  As to disposing of the two suits of apparel I told Mrs Smith That she should pretend that upon inquiry she had found a friend who would purchase the richest of them but  that she might not mistrust  would stand upon a good bargain And having twenty guineas about me I left them with her in part of payment and bid her  pretend  to get her to part with it for as little more as she could induce her to take  I am setting out for Edgware with poor BeltonMore of whom in my next I shall return tomorrow and leave This in readiness for your messenger if he shall call in my absence Adieu  LETTER XLVIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    In Answer to Letter  xlvi  M Hall  Wedn night July    THOU mightst well apprehend that I should think thou wert playing me booty in communicating my letter to the lady  Thou askest Who would think thou mightst not read to her the least exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defence to thee  I'll tell thee who  The man who in the same letter that he asks this question tells the friend whom he exposes to her resentment  That there is such an air of levity runs thro' his most serious letters that those of his are  least fit to be seen  which ought to be  most to his credit  And now what thinkest thou of thy selfcondemned folly Be however I charge thee more circumspect for the future that so this clumsy error may stand singly by itself  It is painful to her to think of me  Libertine froth  So pernicious and so despicable a plotter  A man whose friendship is no credit to anybody  Harden'd wretch  The devil's counterpart  A wicked wicked man  But  did  she  could  she  dared  she to say or  imply  all thisAnd say it to a man whom she  praises for humanity and prefers to myself for that vir∣tue when all the humanity  he  shews and  she knows it too  is by  my  directionSo robs me of the credit of my own works Admirably intitled all this shews her to thy refinement upon the words  resentment  and  revenge  But thou wert always aiming and blundering at something thou never couldst make out  The praise thou givest to her  ingenuousness  is another of thy peculiars I think not as  thou  dost of her telltale recapitulations and exclamationsWhat end can they answer Only that thou hast an  holy  love The devil fetch thee for thy oddity or it is extremely provoking to suppose one sees such a charming creature stand up∣right before a libertine and talk of the sin against her that cannot be forgivenI wish at my heart that these chaste ladies would have a little modesty in their anger It would sound very strange if I Robert Lovelace should pretend to have more true delicacy in a point that re∣quires the utmost than Miss Clarissa Harlowe  I think I will put it into the head of her Nurse Norton and her Miss Howe by some one of my agents to chide the dear novice for her proclamations  But to be serious Let me tell thee that severe as she is and saucy in asking so contemptuously  What a man is your friend Sir to set himself to punish guilty people  I will never forgive the cursed woman who could commit this last horrid violence on so excellent a creature  The barbarous insults of the two nymphs in their visits to her the choice of the most execrable den that could be found out in order no doubt to induce her to go back to theirs and the still more execrable attempt to propose to her a man who would pay the debt a snare I make no question laid for her despairing and re∣senting heart by that devilish Sally thinking her no doubt a  woman  in order to ruin her with me and to provoke me in a fury to give her up to their remorseless cruelty are outrages that to express myself in her style I never  can  never  will  forgive  But as to thy opinion and the two womens at Smith's that her heart is broken that is the true womens lan∣guage  I wonder how  thou  camest into it Thou who hast seen and heard of so many  female deaths  and  revivals  I'll tell thee what makes  against  this notion of theirs  Her time of life and charming constitution The good she ever delighted to do and fancied she was born to do And which she may still continue to do to as high a degree as ever nay higher since I am no sordid varlet thou knowest Her religious turn a turn that will always teach her to bear  inevitable  evils with patience The contemplation upon her last noble triumph over me and over the whole crew and upon her succeeding escape from us all Her will unviolated And the inward pride of having not deserved the treatment she has met with  How is it possible to imagine that a woman who has all these  consolatories  to reflect upon will die of a broken heart  On the contrary I make no doubt but that as she recovers from the dejection into which this last scurvy villainy which none but wretches of her own sex  could  have been guilty of has thrown her returning Love will reenter her timepacified mind Her thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot Of course she will have livelier notions in her head and these will make her perform all her circumvolutions with ease and pleasure tho' not with so high a degree of either as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted herself above the rest of her sex as she turned round  Thou askest on reciting the bitter invectives that the lady made against thy poor friend standing before her I suppose with thy fingers in thy mouth  What couldst thou say  FOR  me  Have I not in my former letters suggested an hun∣dred things which a friend  in earnest  to vindicate or ex∣cuse a friend might say on such an occasion  But now to current topics and the present state of matters here It is true as my servant told thee that Miss Howe had engaged before this cursed woman's of∣ficiousness to use her interest with her friend in my be∣half And yet she told my cousins in the visit they made her that it was her opinion that she would never for∣give me  I long to know what Miss Howe wrote to her friend in order to induce her to marry the  despicable plotter  the  man whose friendship is no credit to anybody  the  wicked wicked man  Thou hadst the two letters in thy hand Had they been in mine the seal would have yielded to the touch of my warm finger Perhaps without the help of the postoffice bullet and the folds as other plications have done open'd of themselves to oblige my curiosity A wicked omission Jack not to contrive to send them down to me by man and horse It might have passed that the messenger who brought the second letter took them both back I could have returned them by another when copied as from Miss Howe and nobody but my∣self and thee the wiser  My two aunts finding the treaty upon the success of which they have set their foolish hearts likely to run into length are about departing to their own seats having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of that is to say  my word  to marry the lady if she will have me  All I have to do in my present uncertainty is to brighten up my faculties by filing off the rust they have contracted by the town smoke a long imprisonment in my close attendance to so little purpose on my fair per∣verse and to brace up if I can the relaxed fibres of my mind which have been twitch'd and convuls'd like the nerves of some tottering paralytic by means of the tumults she has excited in it that so I may be able to present to her a husband as worthy as I can be of her ac∣ceptance or if she reject me be in a capacity to re∣sume my usual gaiety of heart and shew others of the misleading sex that I am not discouraged by the diffi∣culties I have met with from this sweet individual of it from endeavouring to make myself as acceptable to them as before  In this latter case one tour to France and Italy I dare say will do the business Miss Harlowe will by that time have forgotten all she has suffered from the ingrate∣ful Lovelace Tho' it will be impossible that her Lovelace should ever forget a woman whose equal he despairs to meet with were he to travel from one end of the world to the other  If thou continuest paying off the heavy debts my long letters for so many weeks together have made thee groan under I will endeavour to restrain myself in the desires I have importunate as they are of going to town to throw myself at the feet of my soul's beloved  Policy  and  honesty  both join to strengthen the restraint my  own promise  and  thy engagement  have laid me under on this head I would not afresh provoke On the contrary would give time for her resentments to subside that so all that follows may be her own act and deed  HICKMAN I have a mortal aversion to that fellow has by a line which I have just now received requested an interview with me on Friday at Mr Dormer's as at a  common friend  's Does the business he wants to meet me upon require that it should be at a  common friend  's A challenge implied i'n't it Belford I shall not be civil to him I doubt He has been an intermeddler Then I envy him on Miss Howe's account For if I have a right notion of this Hickman it is impossible that that virago can ever love him  A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue when he has reason to believe that the woman he has a view upon has no love for her husband What good prin∣ciples must that wife have who is kept in against tempta∣tion by a sense of her duty and plighted faith where affe∣ction has no hold of her  Pr'ythee let's know very particularly how it fares with poor Belton'Tis an honest fellowSomething more than his Thomasine seems to stick with him  Tourville Mowbray and myself pass away our time as pleasantly as possibly we can without thee I wish we don't add to Lord M's gouty days by the joy we give him  This is one advantage as I believe I have elsewhere observed that we maledelinquents in lovematters have of the other sexFor while they poor things sit sigh∣ing in holes and corners or run to woods and groves to bemoan themselves for their baffled hopes we can rant and roar hunt and hawk and by new loves banish from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones  Merrily however as we pass our time my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often But I know she will permit me to make her amends after she has plagued me hearti∣ly and that's my consolation  An honest fellow still Clap thy wings and crow Jack  LETTER XLIX  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Thursday morn July    WHAT my dearest creature have been your suffer∣ingsWhat must have been your anguish on so disgraceful an insult committed in the open streets and in the open day  No end I think of the undeserved calamities of a dear soul who has been so unhappily driven and betrayed into the hands of a vile libertine How was I shocked at the receiving of your letter written by another hand and only dictated by youYou must be very ill Nor is it to be wondered at But I hope it is rather from hurry and surprize and lowness which  may  be over∣come than from a grief given way to which may be at∣tended with effects I cannot bear to think of  But whatever you do my dear you must not despond Indeed you must not despond Hitherto you have been in no fault But despair would be all your own and the worst fault you can be guilty of  I cannot bear to look upon another hand instead of yours My dear creature send me a few lines tho'  ever so few  in your own hand if possibleFor they will revive my heart especially if they can acquaint me of your amended health  I expect your answer to my letter of the th We  all  expect it with impatience  His relations are persons of  so much  honourThey are so  very  earnest to rank you among themThe wretch is so  very  penitent  Every one  of  his  family says he is  Your own  are so implacableYour last distress tho' the conse∣quence of his former villainy yet neither brought on by  his direction nor with his knowlege and so much re∣sented by himThat my mamma is absolutely of opinion that  you should be his  Especially if yielding to my wishes as in my letter and those of all his friends you  would  have complied had it not been for this horrid arrest  I will inclose the copy of the letter I wrote to Miss Montague last Tuesday on hearing that nobody knew what was become of you and the answer to it under∣written and signed by Lord M and Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance as well as by the young ladies And also by the wretch himself  I own that I like not the turn of what he has written to me and before I will further interest myself in his favour I have determined to inform myself by a friend from his own mouth of his sincerity and whether his  whole inclination  be in his request to me exclusive of the  wishes of his relations  Yet my heart rises against him on the supposition that there is the shadow of a reason for such a question the lady Miss Clarissa Harlowe But I think with my mother that marriage is now the only means left to make your future life tolerably easy  happy  there is no sayingIn the eye of the world itself his dis∣graces in  that  case will be more than yoursAnd to those who know you glorious will be your triumph  I am obliged to accompany my mother soon to the Isle of Wight My aunt Harman is in a declining way and insists upon seeing us both and Mr Hickman too I think  His sister of whom we had heard so much with her Lord were brought t'other day to visit us She strangely likes me or says she does  I can't say but that I think she answers the excellent character we have heard of her  It would be death to me to set out for the little island and not see you first And yet my mother fond of exert∣ing an authority that she herself by that exertion often brings into question insists that my next visit to you  must  be a congratulatory one as Mrs Lovelace  When I know what will be the result of the questions to be put in my name to that wretch and what is your mind on my letter of the th I shall tell you more of mine  The bearer promises to make so much dispatch as to attend you this very afternoon May he return with good tidings to  Your everaffectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER L  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Thursday afternoon  YOU oppress me my dearest Miss Howe by your flaming yet steady love I will be very brief be∣cause I am not well yet a good deal better than I was and because I am preparing an answer to yours of the th But beforehand I must tell you my dear I will  not  have that man Don't be angry with me But in∣deed I won't So let him be asked no questions about me I beseech you  I do  not  despond my dear I hope I may say  I will  not despond Is not my condition greatly mended I thank Heaven it is  I am no prisoner now in a vile house I am not now in the power of that man's devices I am not now obliged to hide myself in corners for fear of him One of his intimate companions is become my warm friend and engages to keep him from me and that by his own consent I am among honest people I have all my cloaths and effects restored me The wretch himself bears testimony to my honour  Indeed I am very weak and ill▪ But I have an excel∣lent physician Dr H and as worthy an apothecary Mr GoddardTheir treatment of me my dear is perfectly  paternal  My mind too I can find begins to strengthen And methinks at times I find myself superior to my calamities  I shall have sinkings sometimes I must expect such And my father's maledict But you will chide me for introducing that now I am enumerating my comforts  But I charge you my dear that you do not suffer my calamities to sit too heavy upon your own mind If you do that will be to newpoint some of those arrows that have been blunted and lost their sharpness  If you would contribute to  my  happiness give way my dear to  your own  and to the chearful prospects before you  You will think very meanly of your Clarissa Harlowe if you do not believe that the greatest pleasure she can re∣ceive in this life is in your prosperity and welfare Think not of me my only friend but as we were in times past▪ And suppose me gone a great great way offA long journeyHow often are the dearest of friends at their country's call thus partedwith a  certainty  for years with a  probability  for ever  Love me still however But let it be with a weaning love I am not what I was when we were  inseparable  lovers as I may sayOur  views  must now be different Resolve my dear to make a worthy man happy be∣cause a worthy man must make  you  soAnd so my dearest love for the present adieuAdieu my dearest love But I shall soon write again I hope  LETTER LI  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    In Answer to Letter  xlviii  Thursday July    I Read that part of your conclusion to poor Belton▪ where you inquire after him and mention how mer∣rily you and the rest pass your time at M Hall He fetched a deep sigh  You are all very happy  were his words I am sorry they  were  his words for poor fellow he is going very fast Change of air  he  hopes will mend him joined to the chearful company I have left him in But nothing I dare say will  A consuming malady and a consuming mistress to an indulgent keeper are dreadful things to struggle with both together Violence must be used to get rid of the latter and yet he has not spirit left him to exert himself His house is Thomasine's house not his He has not been within his doors for a fortnight past Vagabonding about from inn to inn entering each for a bait only and staying two or three days without power to remove and hardly knowing which to go to next His malady is within him and he cannot run away from it  Her boys once he thought them his are sturdy enough to shoulder him in his own house as they pass by him Siding with the mother they in a manner expel him and in his absence riot away on the remnant of his broken fortunes As to their mother who was once so tender so submissive so studious to oblige that we all pronounced him happy and his course of life the eligible she is now so termagant so insolent that he cannot con∣tend with her without doing infinite prejudice to his health A brokenspirited defensive  hardly a defensive  therefore reduced to And this to a heart for so many years waging  offensive  war nor valuing whom the oppo∣nent what a reductionNow comparing himself to the superannuated lion in the fable kick'd in the jaws and laid sprawling by the spurning heel of an ignoble ass  I have undertaken his cause He has given me leave yet not without reluctance to put him into possession of his own house and to place in it for him his unhappy sister whom he has hitherto slighted  because  unhappy It is hard he told me and wept poor fellow when he said it that he cannot be permitted to die quietly in his own houseThe fruits of blessed keeping these  Tho' but lately apprised of her infidelity it now comes out to have been of so long continuance that he has no room to believe the boys to be his Yet how fond did he use to be of them  If I have occasion for your assistance and that of our compeers in reinstating the poor fellow I will give you notice Mean time I have just now been told that Thomasine declares she will not stir For it seems she suspects that measures will be fallen upon to make her quit She is Mrs Belton she says and will prove her marriage  If she give herself these airs in his lifetime what would she attempt to do after his death  Her boys threaten anybody who shall presume to in∣sult their  mother  Their  father  as they  call  poor Belton they speak of as an unnatural one And their probably  true father  is for ever there  hostilely  there passing for her cousin as usual Now her  protecting cousin  Hardly ever I dare say was there a keeper that did not make a keeperess who lavish'd away on her keptfellow  what she obtained from the extravagant folly of him who kept her  I will do without you if I can The case will be only as I conceive like that of the antient Sarmatians returning after many years absence to their homes their wives then in possession of their slaves So that they had to contend not only with those  wives  conscious of their infidelity and with their  slaves  but with the  children  of those slaves grown up to manhood resolute to defend their mothers and their long manumitted fathers But the noble Sarmatians scorning to attack their slaves with equal weapons only provided themselves with the same sort of whips with which they used formerly to chastise them And attacking them with them the miscreants fled before themIn memory of which to this day the device on the coin in Novogrod in Russia a city of the antient Sarmatia is a man on horseback with a whip in his hand  The poor fellow takes it ill that you did not press him more than you did to be of your party at M Hall It is owing to Mowbray he is sure that he had so very slight an invitation from one whose invitations used to be so warm  Mowbray's speech to him he says he never will for∣give "Why Tom" said the brutal fellow with a curse  thou droopest like a pip or roupcloaking chicken Thou shouldst grow perter or submit to a solitary qua∣rantine if thou wouldst not infect the whole brood  For my own part only that this poor fellow is in di∣stress as well in his affairs as in his mind or I should be sick of you all Such is the relish I have of the con∣versation and such my admiration of the deportment and sentiments of this divine lady that I would forego a month even of thy company to be admitted into hers but for one hour And I am highly in conceit with my∣self greatly as I used to value  thine  for being able spon∣taneously as I may say to make this preference  It is after all a devilish life we have lived And to consider how it all ends in a very few years To see what a state of ill health this poor fellow is so soon reduced to And then to observe how every one of ye run away from  the unhappy being as rats from a falling house▪ is fine comfort to help a man to look back upon companions illchosen and a life misspent  For my own part if I can get some good family to credit me with a sister or a daughter as I have now an increased fortune which will enable me to propose handsome settle∣ments I will desert ye all marry and live a life of rea∣son rather than a life of brute for the time to come  LETTER LII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday night  I Was forced to take back my twenty guineas How the women managed it I can't tell I suppose too readily found a purchaser for the rich suit but she mis∣trusted that I was the advancer of the money and would not let the cloaths go But Mrs Lovick has actually sold for fifteen guineas some rich lace worth three times the sum Out of which she repaid her the money she bor∣rowed for fees to the doctor in an illness occasioned by the barbarity of the most savage of men  Thou kn  west his name  The Doctor called on her in the morning it seems and had a short debate with her about fees She insisted that he should take one every time he came write or not write mistrusting that he only gave verbal directions to Mrs Lovick or the nurse to avoid taking any  He said That it would have been impossible for him had he  not  been a physician to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of so excellent a person He had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offer'd fee But he knew her case could not so suddenly vary as to demand his daily visits She must permit him therefore to inquire after her health of the women be∣low and he must not think of coming up if he were to be  pecuniarily  rewarded for the satisfaction he was so desirous to give himself  It ended in a compromise for a fee each other time Which she unwillingly submitted to telling him that tho' she was at present desolate and in disgrace yet her cir∣cumstances  were of right high and no expences could rise so as to be scrupled whether she lived or died But she submitted she added to the compromise in hopes to see him as often as he had opportunity for she really looked upon him and Mr Goddard from their kind and tender treatment of her with a regard next to filial  I hope thou wilt make thyself acquainted with this worthy doctor when thou comest to town and give him thy thanks for putting her into conceit with the Sex that thou hast given her so much reason to execrate  Farewell  LETTER LIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  M Hall  Friday July    JUST returned from an interview with this Hickman A precise fop of a fellow as starch'd as his ruffles  Thou knowest I love him not Jack and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to perhaps not the merit they should be grantedHowever I am in earnest when I say that he seems to me to be so set so prim so affected so mincing yet so clouterly in his person that I dare engage for thy opinion if thou dost justice to him and to thyself that thou never beheldest such another except in a pierglass  I'll tell thee how I play'd him off  He came in his own chariot to Dormer's and we took a turn in the garden at his request He was devilish ce∣remonious and made a bushel of apologies for the free∣dom he was going to take and after half a hundred hums and haws told me that he camethat he cameto wait on meat the request of  dear Miss Howe  on the account on the accountof Miss Harlowe  Well Sir speak on said I But give me leave to say that if your book be as long as your preface it will take up a week to read it  This was pretty rough thou'lt say But there's nothing like balking these formalists at first When they're put out of their road they are filled with doubts of them∣selves and can never get into it again So that an  honest fellow impertinently attacked as I was has all the game in his own hand quite thro' the conference  He stroak'd his chin and hardly knew what to say At last after parenthesis within parenthesis apologizing for apologies in imitation I suppose of Swift's Digres∣sions in Praise of DigressionsI presume I presume Sir you were privy to the visit made to Miss Howe by the young ladies your cousins in the name of Lord M and Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance  I  was  Sir And Miss Howe had a letter afterwards signed by his Lordship and those Ladies and underwrit∣ten by myself Have you seen it Sir  I can't say but I have It is the principal cause of this visit For Miss Howe thinks your part of it is written with such an air of levityPardon me Sirthat she knows not whether you are in earnest or not in your address to  her  for her interest to her  friend  See p  ▪  of this Volume    Will Miss Howe permit me to explain myself in person to her Mr Hickman  O Sir by no means Miss Howe I am sure would not give you that trouble  I should not think it a trouble I will most readily at∣tend you Sir to Miss Howe and satisfy her in all her scruples Come Sir I will wait upon you now You have a chariot Are alone We can talk as we ride  He hesitated wriggled winced stroaked his ruffles set his wig and pulled his neckcloth which was long enough for a bibI am not going directly back to Miss Howe Sir It will be as well if you will be so good as to satisfy Miss Howe by me  What is it she scruples Mr Hickman  Why Sir Miss Howe observes that in your part of the letter you sayBut let me see Sir I have a copy of what you wrotePulling it outWill you give me leave SirThus you begin  Dear Miss Howe    No offence I hope Mr Hickman  None in the least SirNone at all SirTaking aim as it were to read  Do you use spectacles Mr Hickman  Spectacles  Sir His whole broad face lifted up at me  SpectaclesWhat makes you ask me such a question Such a young man as I use spectacles Sir  They do in Spain Mr Hickman young as well as old to save their eyes Have you ever read Prior's  Alma  Mr Hickman  I have Sir  Custom  is everything in nations as well as with individuals I know the meaning of your que∣stionBut 'tis not the  English  custom  Was you ever in Spain Mr Hickman  No Sir I have been in Holland  In Holland SirNever in France or ItalyI was resolved to travel with him into the land of  Puzzledom  No Sir I cannot say I have as yet  That's a wonder Sir when on the continent  I went on a particular affair I was obliged to return soon  Well Sir you was going to readPray be pleased to proceed  Again he took aim as if his eyes were older than the rest of him and read  After what is written above and signed by names and characters of such unquestionable honour  To be sure taking off his eye nobody questions the honour of Lord M nor that of the good ladies who signed the letter  I hope Mr Hickman nobody questions mine neither  If you please Sir I will read on  I might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself  You are pleased to say  as I KNOW it is to  YOU  Well Mr Hickman I must interrupt you at this place In what I wrote to Miss Howe I distinguish'd the word KNOW I had a reason for it Miss Howe has been very free with my character I have never done her any harm I take it very ill of her And I hope Sir you come in her name to make excuses for it  Miss Howe Sir is a very polite young lady She is not accustomed to treat any gentleman's character unbe∣comingly  Then  I  have the more reason to take it amiss Mr Hickman  Why Sir you know the friendship  No friendship should warrant such freedoms as Miss Howe has taken with my character  I believe he began to wish he had not come near me He seemed quite disconcerted  Have you not heard Miss Howe treat my name with great  Sir I come not to offend or affront you But you know what a love there is between Miss Howe and Miss HarloweI doubt Sir you have not treated Miss Har∣lowe as so fine a young lady deserved to be treated And if love for her friend has made Miss Howe take freedoms as you call them a generous mind on such an occasion will rather be sorry for having given the  cause  than  I know your consequence SirBut I'd rather have this reproof from a lady than from a gentleman I have a great desire to wait upon Miss Howe I am persuaded we should soon come to a good understanding Generous minds are always of kin I know we should agree in everything Pray Mr Hickman be so kind as to in∣troduce me to Miss Howe  SirI can signify your desire if you please to Miss Howe  Do so Be pleased to read on Mr Hickman  He did very formally as if I remembered not what I had written and when he came to the passage about the halter the parson and the hangman reading it Why Sir says he does not this look like a jestMiss Howe thinks it does It is not in the lady's  power  you know Sir to doom you to the gallows  Then if it were Mr Hickman you think she would  You say here to Miss Howe proceeded he that Miss Harlowe is the  most injured of her sex  I know from Miss Howe▪ that she highly resents the injuries you own In∣somuch that Miss Howe doubts that she shall ever prevail upon her to overlook them And as your family are all desirous you should repair her wrongs and likewise desire Miss Howe's interposition with her friend Miss Howe fears from this part of your letter that you are too much in jest and that your offer to do her justice is rather in compliment to your friends intreaties than proceeding from your own inclinations And she desires to know  your true sentiments on this occasion before she interposes further  Do you think Mr Hickman that if I am capable of deceiving my own relations I have so much obligation to Miss Howe who has always treated me with great free∣dom as to acknowlege to  her  what I don't to  them  Sir I beg pardon But Miss Howe thinks that as you have written to her she may ask you by me for an explanation of what you have written  You see Mr Hickman something of me Do  you  think I am in jest or in earnest  I see Sir you are a gay gentleman of fine spirits and all That All I beg in Miss Howe's name is to know if you really and  bona fide  join with your friends in desiring her to use her interest to reconcile you to Miss Harlowe  I should be extremely glad to be reconciled to Miss Harlowe and should owe great obligations to Miss Howe if she could bring about so happy an event  Well Sir and you have no objections to marriage I presume as the terms of that reconciliation  I never liked matrimony in my life I must be plain with you Mr Hickman  I am sorry for it I think it a very happy state  I hope you will find it so Mr Hickman  I doubt not but I shall Sir And I dare say so would you if you were to have Miss Harlowe  If I could be happy in it with anybody it would be with Miss Harlowe  I am surprised SirThen after all you don't think of marrying Miss HarloweAfter the hard usage  What hard usage Mr Hickman I don't doubt but a lady of her niceness has represented what would appear trifles to any other in a very strong light  If what I have had hinted to me SirExcuse me has been offered to the lady she has more than trifles to complain of  Let me know what you have heard Mr Hickman I will very truly answer to the accusations  Sir you know best what you have done You own the lady is the  most injured as well as the most deserving of her sex  I do Sir and yet I would be glad to know what you have  heard  for on that perhaps depends my answer to the questions Miss Howe puts to me by you  Why then Sir since you ask it you cannot be dis∣pleased if I answer youIn the first place Sir you will acknowlege I suppose that you promised Miss Harlowe Marriage and all That  Well Sir and I suppose what you have to charge me with is That I was desirous to have  all That  without marriage  Cotso Sir I know you are deemed to be a man of wit But may I not ask if these things sit not too light upon you  When a thing is done and cannot be helped 'tis right to make the best of it I wish the lady would think so too  I think Sir ladies should not be deceived I think a promise to a lady should be as binding as to any other person at the least  I  believe  you think so Mr Hickman And I believe you are a very honest good sort of a man  I would always keep my word Sir whether to man or woman  You say well And far be it from me to persuade you to do otherwise But what have you farther heard  Thou wilt think Jack I must be very desirous to know in what light my elected spouse had represented things to Miss Howe and how far Miss Howe had communicated them to Mr Hickman  Sir this is no part of my present business  But Mr Hickman 'tis part of mine I hope you would not expect that I should answer  your  questions at the same time that you refuse to answer  mine  What pray have you farther heard  Why then Sir if I must say I am told that Miss Harlowe was carried to a very bad house  Why indeed the people did not prove so good as they should be▪What farther have you heard  I have heard Sir that the lady had strange advantages taken of her very  unfair  ones but what I cannot say  And  cannot  you say Cannot you  guess  Then I'll tell you Sir Perhaps some liberty was taken with her  when she was asleep Do you think no lady ever was taken at such an advantageYou know Mr Hickman that ladies are very shy of trusting themselves with the modestest of our sex when they are disposed to sleep and why so if they did not  expect  that advantages would be taken of them at such times  But Sir had not the lady something given her to make her sleep  Ay Mr Hickman that's the question I want to know if the lady says she had  I have not seen all she has written but by what I have heard it is a very black affairExcuse me Sir  I do excuse you Mr Hickman But supposing it were so do you think a lady was never imposed upon by wine or so Do you think the most cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a stronger liquor for a smaller when she was thirsty after a fatigue in this very warm weather And do you think if she was thus thrown into a profound sleep that she is the only lady that was ever taken at such advantage  Even as you make it Mr Lovelace this matter is not a light one But I fear it is a great deal heavier than as you put it  What reasons have you to fear this Sir What has the lady said Pray let me know I have  reason  to be so earnest  Why Sir Miss Howe herself knows not the whole The lady promises to give her all the particulars at a proper time if she lives but has said enough to make it out to be a very bad affair  I am glad Miss Harlowe has not yet given all the par∣ticulars And since she has not you may tell Miss Howe from me That neither she nor any lady in the world can be more virtuous than Miss Harlowe is to this hour as to her own mind Tell her that I hope she never  will  know the particulars but that she has been unworthily used Tell her that tho' I know not what she has said yet I have such an opinion of her veracity that I would blindly subscribe to the truth of every tittle of it tho' it make me ever so black Tell her that I have but  three  things to blame her for  One  That she won't give me an  opportunity of repairing her wrongs The  Second  That she is so ready to acquaint everybody with what she has suffered that it will put it out of my power to redress those wrongs with any tolerable reputation to either of us Will this Mr Hickman answer any part of the in∣tention of this visit  Why Sir this is talking like a man of honour I own But you say there is a  Third  thing you blame the lady for may I ask what That is  I don't know Sir whether I ought to tell it you or not Perhaps you won't believe it if I do But tho' the lady will tell the  truth  and nothing  but  the truth yet perhaps she will not tell the  whole  truth  Pray SirBut it mayn't be proper Yet you give me great curiosity Sure there is no misconduct in the lady I hope there is not I am sure if Miss Howe did not believe her to be faultless in every particular she would not interest herself so much in her favour as she does dearly as she loves her  I love the lady too well Mr Hickman to wish to lessen her in Miss Howe's opinion especially as she is abandoned of every other friend But perhaps it would hardly be credited if I should tell you  I should be very sorry Sir and so would Miss Howe if this poor lady's conduct had laid her under obligation  to you for this reserve You have so much the appear∣ance of a gentleman as well as are so much distinguished in your family and fortunes that I hope you are incapa∣ble of loading such a young lady as this in order to lighten yourselfExcuse me Sir  I do I do Mr Hickman You say you came not with any intention to affront me I take freedom and I give itI should be very loth I repeat to say anything that may weaken Miss Harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend she thinks she has left  It may not be proper said he for me to know your  third  article against this unhappy lady But I never heard of any body out of her own implacable family that had the least doubt of her honour Mrs Howe indeed once said after a conference with one of her uncles that she feared all was not right of her sideBut else I never heard  Oons Sir in a fierce tone and with an erect mien stopping short upon him which made him start back 'Tis next to blasphemy to question the lady's honour She is more pure than a vestal for vestals have been often warmed by their own fires No age from the first to the present ever produced nor will the future to the end of the world I dare averr ever produce a young bloom∣ing lady tried as she has been tried who has stood all tri∣als as she has done Let me tell you Sir That you never saw never knew never heard of such another lady as Miss Harlowe  Sir Sir I beg your pardon Far be it from me to question the lady You have not heard me say a word that could be so construed I have the utmost honour for her Miss Howe loves her as she loves her own soul and that she would not do if she were not sure she were as virtuous as herself  As herself  SirI have a high opinion of Miss Howe SirBut I dare say  What Sir dare you say of Miss HoweI hope Sir you will not presume to say anything to the disparage∣ment of Miss Howe  Presume  Mr HickmanThat is  presuming  language let me tell you Mr Hickman  The  occasion  for it Mr Lovelace if designed is  pre∣suming  if you pleaseI am not a man ready to take of∣fence SirEspecially where I am employed as a medi∣ator But no man breathing shall say disparaging things of Miss Howe in my hearing without observation  Well said Mr Hickman I dislike not your spirit on such a  supposed  occasion But what I was going to say is this That there is not in my opinion a woman in the world who ought to compare herself with Miss Clarissa Harlowe till she has stood  her  trials and has behaved  under  them and  after  them as she has done You see Sir I speak against myself You see▪ I do For liber∣tine as I am thought to be I never will attempt to bring down the measures of right and wrong to the standard of my actions  Why Sir this is very right It is very  noble  I will say But 'tis pityExcuse me Sir'tis pity that the  man who can pronounce so fine a sentence will not square his actions accordingly  That Mr Hickman is another point We all err in some things I wish not that Miss Howe should have Miss Harlowe's trials And I rejoice that she is in no danger of any such from so good a man  Poor Hickman He looked as if he knew not whe∣ther I meant a compliment or a reflection  But proceeded I since I find that I have excited your curiosity that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the most admirable of women I am inclined to hint to you what I have in the  third  place to blame her for  Sir as you pleaseIt may not be proper  It cannot be very  improper  Mr HickmanSo let me ask you What would Miss Howe think if her friend is the  more  determined against me because she thinks in re∣venge to me I verily believe that of encouraging an∣other lover  How Sir Sure this cannot be the case I can tell you Sir if Miss Howe thought this she would not ap∣prove of it at all For little as you think Miss Howe likes you Sir and little as she approves of your actions by her friend I know she is of opinion that she ought to have nobody living but you And should continue single all her life if she be not yours  Revenge and obstinacy Mr Hickman will make wo∣men the best of them do very unaccountable things Rather than not put out both eyes of the man they are offended with they will give up one of their own  I don't know what to say to this Sir But sure she cannot encourage any other person's address So soon tooWhy Sir she is as we are told so ill and so  weak    Not in resentment weak I'll assure you I am well acquainted with all her movementsAnd I tell you be∣lieve it or not that she refuses  me  in view of  another  lover  Can it be  'Tis true by my soulHas she not hinted This to Miss Howe do you think  No indeed Sir If she had I should not have trou∣bled you at this time from Miss Howe  Well then you see I am right That tho' she cannot be guilty of a falshood yet she has not told her friend the whole truth  What shall a man say to these things looking most stupidly perplexed  Say say  Mr Hickman Who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and offended lady Endless would be the histories I could give you within my own knowlege of the dreadful effects of womens pas∣sionate resentments and what that Sex will do when dis∣appointed But can there be a stronger instance than this of such a person as Miss Harlowe who at this very in∣stant and ill as she is not only encourages but in a manner makes court to one of the most odious dogs that ever was seen I think Miss Howe should not be told this And yet she ought too in order to dissuade her from such a preposterous rashness  O fie O strange Miss Howe knows nothing of this To be sure she won't look upon her if this be true  'Tis true very true Mr Hickman True as I am here to tell you so And he is an ugly fellow too ug∣lier to look at than me  Than  you  Sir Why to be sure you are one of the handsomest men in England  Well but the wretch she so spitefully prefers to me is a mishapen meager varlet more like a skeleton than a man Then he dressesyou never saw a devil so bedi∣zened Hardly a coat to his back nor a shoe to his foot A baldpated villain yet grudges to buy a peruke to hide his baldness For he is as covetous as hell never satisfied yet plaguy rich  Why Sir there is some joke in this surely A man of common parts knows not how to take such gentlemen as you But Sir if there be any truth in the story what is he Some Jew or miserly citizen I suppose that may have presumed on the lady's distressful circumstances and your lively wit points him out as it pleases  Why the rascal has estates in every county  in  England and  out of  England too  Some EastIndia governor I suppose if there be anything in it The lady once had thoughts of going abroad  But I fancy all this time you are in jest Sir If not we must surely have heard of him  Heard of him Ay Sir we have all heard of him But none of us care to be intimate with himexcept this ladyand that as I told you in spite to meHis name in short is DEATHDEATH Sir stamping and speaking loud and full in his ear which made him jump half a yard high  Thou never beheldest any man so disconcerted He looked as if the frightful skeleton was before him and he had not his accounts ready When a little recovered he fribbled with his waistcoat buttons as if he had been tell∣ing his beads  This Sir proceeded I is her wooerNay she is so forward a girl that she  wooes him  But I hope it never will be a match  He had before behaved and now looked with more spirit than I expected from him  I came Sir said he as a mediator of differences It behoves me to keep my temper But Sir and turned short upon me as much as I love peace and to promote it I will not be illused  As I had played so much upon him it would have been wrong to take him at his  more  than halfmenace Yet I think I owe him a grudge for his presuming to address Miss Howe  You mean no defiance I presume Mr Hickman any more than I do offence On that presumption I ask your excuse But This is my way I mean no harm I can∣not let sorrow touch my heart I cannot be grave six minutes together for the blood of me I am a descend∣ent of old Chancellor More I believe and should not forbear to cut a joke were I upon the scaffold But you may gather from what I have  said  that I prefer Miss Harlowe and that upon the justest grounds to all the wo∣men in the world And I wonder that there should be any difficulty to believe from what I have signed and from what I have promised to my relations and enabled them to promise for me that I should be glad to marry that excellent lady upon her own terms I acknowlege to you Mr Hickman that I have basely injured her If  she will honour me with her hand I declare that it is my intention to make her the best of husbands But never∣theless I must say that if she goes on appealing her case and exposing us both as she does it is impossible to think the knot can be knit with reputation to either And al∣tho' Mr Hickman I have delivered my apprehensions under so ludicrous a figure I am afraid that she will ruin her constitution and by seeking death when she may shun him will not be able to avoid him when she would be glad to do so  This cool and honest speech let down his stiffened mus∣cles into complacency He was my very obedient and faithful humble servant several times over as I waited on him to his chariot And I was his almost as often  And so  Exit  Hickman  LETTER LIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    In answer to Letters  xlvii li lii  Friday night July    I WILL throw away a few paragraphs upon the con∣tents of thy last shocking letters just brought me and send what I shall write by the fellow who carries mine on the interview with Hickman  Reformation I see is coming fast upon thee Thy uncle's slow death and thy attendance upon him thro' every stage towards it prepared thee for it But go thou on in thy own way as I will in mine Happiness consists in being pleased with what we do And if thou canst find delight in being  sad  it will be as well for thee as if thou wert  merry  tho' no other person should join to keep thee in countenance  I am nevertheless exceedingly disturbed at the lady's ill health It is intirely owing to the cursed arrest She was absolutely triumphant over me and the whole crew before Thou believest me guiltless of That So I hope does she The rest as I have often said is a common case only a little uncommonly circumstanced that's all Why then all these severe things from her and thee  As to selling her cloaths and her laces and so forth  it has I own a shocking sound with it What an im∣placable as well as unjust set of wretches are those of her unkindredly kin who have money of hers in their hands as well as large arrears of her own estate yet with∣hold both  avowedly  to distress her But may she not have money of that proud and saucy friend of hers Miss Howe more than she wants And should I not be overjoyed thinkst thou to serve herWhat then is there in the parting with her apparel but female perversenessAnd I am not sure whether I ought not to be glad if she does this out of  spite to me  Some disappointed fairones would have hanged some drowned themselves My beloved only revenges herself upon her cloaths Different ways of working has passion in different bosoms as humour and complexion induceBesides dost think I shall grudge to replace to three times the value what she disposes of So Jack there is no great matter in this  Thou seest how sensible she is of the soothings of the polite Doctor This will enable thee to judge how dread∣fully the horrid arrest and her gloomy father's curse must have hurt her I have great hope if she will but see me that my behaviour my contrition my soothings may have some happy effects upon her  But thou art too ready to give me up Let me seriously tell thee that all excellence as she is I think the earnest interposition of my relations the implored mediation of that little fury Miss Howe and the commissions thou act∣est under from myself are such instances of condescen∣sion and high value in  them  and such contrition in  me  that nothing farther can be doneSo here let the matter rest for the present till she considers better of it  But now a few words upon poor Belton's case I own I was at first a little startled at the infidelity of his Tho∣masine Her hypocrisy to be for so many years undetect∣edI have very lately had some intimations given me of her vileness and had intended to mention it to thee when I saw thee To say the truth I always suspected her  eye  The  eye  thou knowest is the  casement  at which the  heart  generally looks out Many a woman who will not shew herself at the  door  has tipt the sly the intelligible  win  from the  windows  But Tom had no management at all A very careless fellow Would never look into his own affairs The estate his uncle left him was his ruin Wife or mistress whoever was must have had his fortune to sport with  I have often hinted his weaknesses of this sort to him and the danger he was in of becoming the property of de∣signing people But he hated to take pains He would ever run away from his accounts as now poor fellow he would be glad to do from himself Had he not had a  woman  to fleece him his  coachman  or  valet  would have been his  prime minister  and done it as effectually  But yet for many years I thought she was true to his bed At least I thought the boys were his own For tho' they are muscular and bigboned yet I supposed the healthy mother might have furnished them with legs and shoulders For she is not of a delicate frame and then Tom some years ago looked up and spoke more like a man than he has done of late squeaking inwardly poor fellow for some time past from contracted quailpipes and wheesing from lungs half spit away  He complains thou sayest that we all run away from him Why after all Belford it is no pleasant thing to see a poor fellow one loves dying by inches yet unable to do him good There are friendships which are only  bottledeep  I should be loth to have it thought that mine for any of my vassals is such a one Yet to gay hearts which  became intimate because they were gay  the reason for their first intimacy ceasing the friendship will fade that sort of friendship I mean which may be distinguished more properly by the word  companionship  But mine as I said is deeper than this I would still be as ready as ever I was in my life to the utmost of my power to do him service  As one instance of this my readiness to extricate him from all his difficulties as to Thomasine dost thou care to propose to him an expedient that is just come into my head  It is this I would engage Thomasine and her cubs if Belton be convinced they are neither of them his in a party of pleasure She was always complaisant to me It  should be in a boat hired for the purpose to sail to Tilbury to the isle of Sheepy or a pleasuring up the Medway and 'tis but contriving to turn the boat bottomupward I can swim like a fish Another boat should be ready to take up whom I should direct for fear of the worst And then if Tom has a mind to be decent one suit of mourning will serve for all three Nay the hostlercousin may take his plunge from the steerage And who knows but they may be thrown up on the beach Thomasine and he hand in hand  This thou'lt say is no  common  instance of friendship  Mean time do thou prevail upon him to come down to us He never was more welcome in his life than he shall be now If he will not let him find me some other service and I will clap a pair of wings to my shoulders and he shall see me come flying in at his windows at the word of command  As for thy resolution of repenting and marrying I would have thee consider which thou wilt set about first If thou wilt follow my advice thou shalt make short work of it Let Matrimony take place of the other for the  thou wilt very possibly have Repentance come tumbling in fast upon thee as a consequence and so have both i  one  LETTER LV  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday noon July    THIS morning I was admitted as soon as I sent up my name into the presence of the divine lady Such I may call her as what I have to relate will fully prove  She had had a tolerable night and was much better in spirits though weak in person and visibly declining in looks  Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith were with her and ac∣cused her in a gentle manner of having applied herself too assiduously to her pen for her strength having been up ever since five She said she had rested better th  she had done for many nights She had found her spirit  free and her mind tolerably easy And having as she had reason to think but a short time and much to do in it she must be a good housewife of her hours  She had been writing she said a letter to her sister But had not pleased herself in it tho' she had made two or three essays But that the last must go  By hints I had dropt from time to time she had rea∣son she said to think that I knew everything that concern∣ed her and her family and if so must be acquainted with the heavy curse her father had laid upon her which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part as to her tem∣porary prospects and that in a very short time which gave her great apprehensions for the other She had been applying herself to her sister to obtain a revocation of it I hope my father will revoke it said she or I shall be very miserable Yet and she gasped as she spoke with apprehensionI am ready to tremble at what the answer may be for my sister is hardhearted  I said something reflecting upon her friends as to what they would deserve to be thought of if the unmerited im∣precation were not withdrawnUpon which she took me up and talked in such a dutiful manner of her parents as must doubly condemn them if they remain implacable for their inhuman treatment of such a daughter  She said I must not blame her parents It was her dear Miss Howe's fault But what an enormity was there in her crime which could set the best of parents as they had been to her till she disobliged them in a bad light for resenting the rashness of a child from whose educa∣tion they had reason to expect better fruits There were some hard circumstances in her case it was true But my  friend  could tell me that no  one  body throughout the whole fatal transaction had acted out of character but  herself  She submitted therefore to the penalty she had incurred If they had any fault it was only that they would not inform themselves of some circumstances which would alleviate a little her misdeed and that supposing her a guiltier creature than she was they punished her without a hearing  Lord  I was going to curse thee Lovelace How every instance of excellence in this allexcelling creature condemns  theeThou wilt have reason to think thyself of all men most accursed if she die  I then besought her while she was capable of such glo∣rious instances of generosity and forgiveness to extend her goodness to a man whose heart bled in every vein of it for the injuries he had done her and who would make it the study of his whole life to repair them  The women would have withdrawn when the subject became so particular But she would not permit them to go She told me that if after this time I was for en∣tering with so much earnestness into a subject so very disagreeable to  her  my visits must not be repeated Nor was there occasion she said for my friendly offices in your favour since she had begun to write her whole mind upon that subject to Miss Howe in answer to letters from her in which Miss Howe urged the same arguments in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations  Mean time you may let him know said she That I reject him with my whole heartYet that altho' I say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt however I say it not with passion On the con∣trary tell him that I am trying to bring my mind into such a frame as to be able to  pity  him Poor perjured wretch what has he not to answer for and that I shall not think myself qualified for the state I am aspiring to if after a few struggles more I cannot  forgive  him too And I hope clasping her hands together uplifted as were her eyes my dear  earthly  father will set me the example my  heavenly  one has already set us all and by forgiving his fallen daughter teach her to forgive the man who then I hope will not have destroyed my eternal pro∣spects as he has my temporal  Stop here thou wretchBut I need not bid theeFor I can go no farther  LETTER LVI  Mr  BELFORD  In Continuation  YOU will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behaviour was to me at the time when the  bare recollection and transcription obliged me to drop my pen The women had tears in their eyes I was silent for a few momentsAt last Matchless excellence In∣imitable goodness I called her with a voice so accented that I was halfashamed of myself as it was before the wo∣men But who could stand such sublime generosity of soul in so young a creature her loveliness giving grace to all she saidMethinks said I and I really in a man∣ner involuntarily bent my knee I have before me an angel indeed I can hardly forbear prostration and to beg your influence to draw me after you to the world you are aspiring to YetBut what shall I sayOnly dearest excellence make me in some small instances ser∣viceable to you that I may if I survive you have the glory to think I was able to contribute to your satisfaction while among us  Here I stopt She was silent I proceeded Have you no commission to employ me in deserted as you are by all your friends among strangers though I doubt not worthy people Cannot I be serviceable by message by letterwriting by attending personally with either message or letter your father your uncles your brother your sister Miss Howe Lord M or the ladies his sisters Any office to be employed in to serve you absolutely  independ∣ent  of my  friend  's wishes or of my own wishes to oblige him Think Madam if I cannot  I thank you Sir Very heartily I thank you But in nothing that I can at present think of or at least resolve upon can you do me service I will see what return the letter I have written will bring me Till then  My life and my fortune interrupted I are devoted to your service Permit me to observe that here you are without one natural friend and so much do I know of your unhappy case that you must be in a manner desti∣tute of the means to  make  friends  She was going to interrupt me with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in her manner  I beg leave to proceed Madam I have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before▪ but never dared till now Suffer me now that I have broke the ice to tender myself as your  banker  only I know you will  not be obliged You  need  not You have sufficient of your own if it were in your hands and from  that  whe∣ther you live or die will I consent to be reimbursed I do assure you that the unhappy man shall never know either  my  offer or  your  acceptance Only permit me this small  And down behind her chair I dropt a Bank note of l which I had brought with me intending some how or other to leave it behind me Nor shouldst thou ever have known it had she favoured me with the acceptance of it and so I told her  You give me great pain Mr Belford said she by these instances of your humanity And yet considering the company I have seen you in I am not sorry to find you capable of such Methinks I am glad for the sake of human nature that there could be but  one  such man in the world as him you and I know But as to your kind offer whatever it be if you take it not up you will greatly disturb me I have no need of your kindness I have effects enough which I never can want to supply my present occasions and if needful can have recourse to Miss Howe I have promised that I wouldSo pray Sir urge not upon me this favourTake it up yourself If you mean me peace and ease of mind urge not this fa∣vour And she spoke with impatience  I beg Madam but one word  Not one Sir till you have taken back what you have let fall I doubt not either the  honour  or the  kindness  of your offer but you must not say one word more on this subject I cannot bear it  She was stooping but with pain I therefore prevented her and besought her to forgive me for a tender which I saw had been more discomposing to her than I had hoped from the purity of my intentions it would be But I could not bear to think that such a mind as hers should be distressed Since the want of the conveniencies she was used to abound in might affect and disturb her in the divine course she was in  You are very kind to me Sir said she and very fa∣vourable in your opinion of me But I hope that I can∣not now be easily put out of my present course My de∣clining health will more and more confirm me in it Those  who arrested and con  ined me no doubt thought they had fallen upon the ready method to distress me so as to bring me into all their measures But I presume to hope that I have a mind that cannot be debased in  essential instances  by  temporary calamities  Little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles forgive my own  implied  vanity was her word who imagine that a prison or penury or want can bring a rightturned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness in order to avoid such  shortlived evils  She then turned from me towards the window with a dignity suitable to her words and such as shewed her to be more of soul than of body at that instant  What magnanimity No wonder a virtue so solidly based could baffle all thy arts And that it forced thee in order to carry thy accursed point to have recourse to those unnatural ones which robbed her of her charming senses  The women were extremely affected Mrs Lovick espe∣ciallywho said whisperingly to Mrs Smith We have an angel not a woman with us Mrs Smith  I repeated my offers to write to any of her friends and told her that having taken the liberty to acquaint Dr H with the cruel displeasure of her relations as what I pre∣sumed lay nearest her heart he had proposed to write him∣self to acquaint her friends how ill she was if she would not take it amiss  It was kind in the  Doctor  she said But begged that no step of that sort might be taken without her knowlege and consent She would wait to see what effects her let∣ter to her sister would have All she had to hope for was that her father would revoke his malediction For the rest her friends would think she could not suffer too much and she was content to suffer For now nothing could happen that could make her wish to live  Mrs Smith went down and soon returning asked If the lady and I would not dine with her that day For it yes her weddingday She had engaged Mrs Lovick see said and should have nobody else if we would do her that favour  The charming creature sighed and shook her head  Weddingday  repeated she I wish you Mrs Smith many happy weddingdaysBut you will excuse  me  Mr Smith came up with the same request They both applied to me  On condition the  lady  would I should make no scruple and would suspend an engagement Which I actually had  She then desired they would all sit down You have several times Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith hinted your wishes that I would give you some little history of my∣self Now if you are at leisure that this gentleman who I have reason to believe knows it all is present and can tell you if I give it justly or not I will oblige your curiosity  They all eagerly the man Smith too sat down and she began an account of herself which I will endeavour to repeat as nearly in her own words as I possibly can For I know you will think it of importance to be ap∣prised of her manner of relating your barbarity to her as well as what her sentiments are of it and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour from her  At first when I took these lodgings said she I thought of staying but a short time in them and so Mrs Smith I told you I therefore avoided giving any other ac∣count of myself than that I was a very unhappy young creature seduced from good friends and escaped from very vile wretches  This account I thought myself obliged to give that you might the less wonder at seeing a young body rush∣ing thro' your shop into your back apartment all trembling and out of breath an ordinary garb over my own craving lodging and protection only giving my bare word that you should be handsomely paid All my effects contained in a pockethandkerchief  My sudden absence for three days and nights toge∣ther when arrested must still further surprise you And altho' this gentleman who perhaps knows more of the darker part of my story than I do myself has informed you as you Mrs Lovick tell me that I am only an  unhappy  not a  guilty  creature yet I think it incumbent upon me not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character  You must know then that I have been in one in∣stance I had like to have said  but  in one instance but that was a capital one an undutiful child to the most indulgent of parents For what some people call cruelty in them is owing but to the excess of their love and to their disappointment having had reason to ex∣pect better from me  I was visited at first with my friends connivance by a man of birth and fortune but of worse principles as it proved than I believed any man could have My brother a very headstrong young man was absent at that time and when he returned from an old grudge and knowing the gentleman it is plain better than I knew him intirely disapproved of his visits And having a great sway in our family brought other gentlemen to address me And at last several having been rejected he introduced one extremely disagreeable In every  indif∣ferent  body's eyes disagreeable I could not love him They all joined to compel me to have him a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against and my brother having confirmed them all his enemies  To be short I was con  ined and treated so very hardly that in a rash sit I appointed to go off with the man they hated A wicked intention you'll say But I was greatly provoked Nevertheless I repented and resolved not to go off with him yet I did not mistrust his honour to me neither nor his love because no∣body thought me unworthy of the latter and my for∣tune was not to be despised But foolishly wickedly as my friends still think and contrivingly with a design as they imagine to abandon them giving him a private meeting I was trick'd away poorly enough trick'd away I must needs say tho' others who had been first guilty of so rash a step as the meeting of him was might have been so deceived and surprised as well as I  After remaining some time at a farmhouse in the country behaving to me all the time with honour he brought me to handsome lodgings in town till still better provision could be made for me But they proved to be as he indeed knew and designed at a vile a very vile creature's tho' it was long before I found  her out to be so for I knew nothing of the town or its ways  There is no repeating what followed Such unpre∣cedented vile artsfor I gave him no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage  And here half covering her sweet face with her hand∣kerchief put to her tearful eyes she stopt  Hastily as if she would fly from the hateful remem∣brance she resumed  I made my escape afterwards from the abominable house in his absence and came to yours And this gentleman has almost prevailed on me to think that the ingrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest Which was made no doubt in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings For no∣thing do I owe them except I were to pay them  She sighed and again wiped her charming eyesadding in a softer lower voice  "for being ruined"    Indeed Madam said I guilty abominably guilty as he is in all the rest he is innocent of this last wicked outrage  Well and so I wish him to be That evil heavy as it was is one of the slightest evils I have suffered But hence you'll observe Mrs Lovick for you seemed this morning curious to know if I were not a wife that I  never was married  You Mr Belford no doubt knew before that I am no wife And now I never will be one Yet I bless God that I am not a guilty creature  As to my parentage I am of no mean family I have in my own right by the intended favour of my grandfather a fortune not contemptible Independent of my  father  if I had pleased but I never will please  My father is very rich I went by another name when I came to you first But that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man who now engages by this gentleman not to molest me  My real name you now know to be Harlowe  Clarissa  Harlowe I am not yet twenty years of age  I have an excellent mother as well as father a woman of family and fine senseWorthy of a better childThey both doated upon me  I have two good uncles Men of great fortune jealous of the honour of their family which I have wounded  I was the joy of their hearts and with theirs and my father's I had three houses to call my own for they used to have me with them by turns and almost kindly to quarrel for me So that I was two months in the year at one's house two months at the other's Six months at my father's and two at the houses of others of my dear friends who thought themselves happy in me And whenever I was at any one's I was crouded upon with letters by all the rest who longed for my return to them  In short I was beloved by everybody The Poor I used to make glad  their  hearts I never shut my hand to any distress whereever I was But now I am poor myself  So Mrs Smith so Mrs Lovick I am  not  married It is but just to tell you so And I am now as I ought to be in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil God I hope will forgive me as I am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world even the man who has ingratefully and by dreadful perjuries Poor wretch he thought all his wickedness to be  wit  reduced to this a young creature who had  his  happiness in her  view  and in her  wish  even beyond this life and who was believed to be of rank and fortune and expectations considerable enough to make it the  interest  of any gentleman in England to be faithful to his vows to her But I cannot expect that my parents will for∣give me My refuge must be death the most painful kind of which I would suffer rather than be the wife of one who could act by me as the man has acted upon whose birth education and honour I had so much reason to found better expectations  I see continued she that I who once was every∣one's delight am now the cause of grief to everyone You that are strangers to me are moved for me 'Tis kind But 'tis time to stop Your compassionate hearts Mrs Smith and Mrs Lovick are too much  touched For the women sobb'd again and the man was also affected It is barbarous in me with my woes thus to sadden your weddingday  Then turning to Mr and Mrs Smith  May you see many happy ones honest good coupleHow agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate it after many years are gone over youI onceBut no moreAll my pro∣spects of felicity as to this life are at an end My hopes like opening buds or blossoms in an overforward spring have been nipt by a severe frostBlighted by an eastern wind But I can but  once die  and if life be spared me but till I am discharged from a heavy malediction which my father in his wrath laid upon me and which is fulfilled literally in every article re∣lating to this world it is all I have to wish for and death will be welcomer to me than rest to the most wearied traveller that ever reached his journey'send  And then she sunk her head against the back of her chair and hiding her face with her handkerchief en∣deavoured to conceal her tears from us  Not a soul of us could speak a word Thy presence perhaps thou harden'd wretch might have made us ashamed of a weakness which perhaps thou wilt deride  me  in particular for when thou readest this  She retired to her chamber soon after and was forced it seems to lie down We all went down together and for an hour and half dwelt upon her praises Mrs Smith and Mrs Lovick repeatedly expressing their astonishment that there could be a man in the world capable of offend∣ing much more of wilfully injuring such a lady and repeating that they had an angel in their house I thought they had and that as assuredly as there was a devil under the roof of good Lord M  I hate thee heartily By my faith I do Every hour I hate thee more than the former  J BELFORD  LETTER LVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat July    WHAT dost hate me for Belford And why more and moreHave I been guilty of any of∣fence thou knewest not before If  pathos  can move such a heart as thine can it alter factsDid I not al∣ways do this incomparable creature as much justice as thou canst do her for the heart of thee or as she can do herselfWhat nonsense then thy hatred thy  augmented  hatred when I still persist to marry her pursuant to word given to thee and to faith plighted to all my relations But hate if thou wilt so thou dost but write Thou canst not hate me so much as I do myself And yet I know if thou really hatedst me thou wouldst not venture to tell me so  Well but after all what need of her history to these women She will certainly repent some time hence that she has thus needlesly exposed us both  Sickness palls every appetite and makes us hate what we loved But renewed health changes the scene dis∣poses us to be pleased with ourselves and then we are in a way to be pleased with everyone else Every hope then rises upon us Every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet And what Mr Addison says of Liberty may with still greater propriety be said of  Health For what is Liberty itself without Health  It makes the gloomy face of nature gay  Gives beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day  And I rejoice that she is already so much better as to hold with strangers such a long and interesting con∣versation  Strange confoundedly strange and as perverse that is to say as  womanly  as strange that she should refuse and sooner choose to dieO the obscene word and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me than be mine who offended her by acting  in  character while her pa∣rents acted shamefully  out of theirs  and when I am now  willing to act  out of my own  to oblige her Yet I not to be forgiven They to be faultless with herAnd mar∣riage the only medium to repair all breaches and to salve her own honourSurely thou must see the inconsistence of her  forgiving  unforgivingness as I may call itYet heavy varlet as thou art thou wantest to be drawn up af∣ter her And what a figure dost thou make with thy speeches stiff as Hickman's ruffles with thy aspirations and prostrationsUnused thy weak head to bear the sublimities that fall even in common conversation from the lips of this evercharming creature  But the prettiest whim of all was to drop the bank note behind her chair instead of presenting it on thy knees to her hand To make such a lady as this  doubly  stoopBy the acceptance and to take it from the ground What an ungraceful  benefitconferrer  art thou How aukward to take it into thy head that the best way of making a present to a lady was to throw the present be∣hind her chair  I am very desirous to see what she has written to her sister what she is about to write to Miss Howe and what return she will have from the HarloweArabella Canst thou not form some scheme to come at the copies of these letters or at the substance of them at least and of that of her other correspondencies Mrs Lovick thou seemest to say is a pious woman The lady having gi∣ven such a particular history of herself will acquaint her with everything And art thou not about to reform Won't this consent of minds between thee and the widow What age is she Jack The devil never trumpt up a friendship between a man and a woman of anything like years which did not end in matrimony or the dissipa∣tion of both their morals won't it strike out an inti∣macy between ye that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular A proselyte I can tell thee has great influence upon your good people Such a one is a saint of their own creation and they will water and cultivate and cherish him as a plant of their own raising and this from a pride truly spiritual  But one consolation arises to me from the pretty re∣grets this admirable creature seems to have in indulging  reflections on the peoples weddingday  I  ONCEthou makest her break off with saying  She once  What O Belford why didst thou not urge her to explain what she  once  hoped  What once a lady hopes in lovematters she always hopes while there is room for hope And are we not both single Can she be any man's but mine Will I be any woman's but hers  I never will I never canAnd I tell thee that I am every day every hour more and more in love with her And at this instant have a more vehement passion for her than ever I had in my lifeAnd that with views ab∣solutely honourable in  her own sense  of the word Nor have I varied so much as in  wish  for this week past firmly fixed and wrought into my very nature as the  life of honour  or of generous confidence in me was in preference to the life of  doubt  and  distrust  That must be a  life of doubt  and  distrust  surely where the woman con∣fides nothing and ties up a man for his good behaviour for life taking church and state sanctions in aid of the obligation she imposes upon him  I shall go on Monday morning to a kind of Ball to which Colonel Ambrose has invited me It is given on a family account I care not on what For all that de∣lights me in the thing is that Mrs and Miss Howe are to be there Hickman of course for the old lady will not stir abroad without him The Colonel is in hopes that Miss Arabella Harlowe will be there likewise for all the fellows and women of fashion round him are in∣vited  I fell in by accident with the Colonel who I believe hardly thought I would accept of the invitation But he knows me not if he thinks I am ashamed to appear at any place where ladies dare shew their faces Yet he hinted to me that my name  was up  on Miss Harlowe's account But to allude to one of my uncle's phrases if it be I will not  lie abed  when anything joyous is going forward  As I shall go in my Lord's chariot I would have had one of my cousins Montague to go with me But they both refused And I sha'n't choose to take either of thy  brethren It would look as if I thought I wanted a body∣guard Besides one of them is too rough the other too smooth and too great a fop for some of the staid company that will be there and for  me  in particular Men are known by their companions and a fop as Tourville for example takes great pains to hang out a sign by his dress of what he has in his shop Thou indeed art an exception dressing like a coxcomb yet a very clever fellow Nevertheless so clumsy a beau that thou seemest to me to owe thyself a double spite making thy un∣gracefulness appear the  more  ungraceful by thy remark∣able tawdriness when thou art out of mourning  I remember when I first saw thee my mind laboured with a strong puzzle whether I should put thee down for a great fool or a smatterer in wit Something I saw was wrong in thee by thy  dress  If this fellow thought I delights not so much in  ridicule  that he will not spare  himself  he must be plaguy silly to take so much pains to make his ugliness more conspicuous than it would other∣wise be  Plain dress for an ordinary man or woman implies at least  modesty  and always procures kind quarter from the censorious Who will ridicule a personal imperfection in one that seems conscious that it  is  an imperfection  Who ever said an anchoret was poor  But to such as appear proud of their deformity or bestow tinsel upon it in hopes to set it off who would spare so very absurd a wronghead  But altho' I put on these lively airs I am sick at my soulMy whole heart is with my charmer With what indifference shall I look upon all the assemblée at the Co∣lonel's my Beloved in my ideal eye and engrossing my whole heart  LETTER LVIII  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  ARABELLA HARLOWE  Thursday July    Miss  HARLOWE  I Cannot help

knows not that I write Some violent words in the nature of an imprecation from her father afflict her greatly in her weak state I presume not to direct to you what to do in this case You are her

YOUR pert letter I have received You that spare nobody I cannot expect should spare me You are very happy in a prudent and watchful motherBut elseMine cannot be exceeded in prudence But we had all too good an opinion of Somebody to think watch∣fulness needful There may possibly be some reason why  you  are so much attached to her in an error of this fla∣grant nature  I  help to make a sister

to engage  every  body's notice Others may be the  happier  tho' they may be the more  envious  for nobody's thinking them worthy of any But one would be glad people had the sense to be thankful for that want of consequence which subjected them not to hazards they would hardly have been able to manage under  I own to you that had it not been for the prudent advice of that admirable Somebody whose principal fault is the superiority of her talents and whose misfortune to be brother'd and sister'd by a couple of creatures who are not able to comprehend her excellencies I might at one time have been plunged into difficulties But pert as the  superlatively pert may think me I thought not myself  wiser  because I was  older  nor for that  poor  reason qua∣lified to prescribe to much less to maltreat a genius so outsoaring  I repeat it with gratitude that the dear creature's ad∣vice was of very great service to meAnd this before my mother's  watchfulness  became necessary But how it would have fared with me I cannot say had I had a brother or sister who had deemed it their  interest  as well as a gratification of their  sordid envy  to misrepresent me  Your admirable sister in effect saved  you  Miss as well as  me  With this differenceYou  against  your will Me  with  mine And but for  your  own brother and  his  own sister would not have been lost herself  Would to God both sisters had been obliged with their own willsThe most admirable of her sex would never then have been out of her father's house  You  MissI don't know what had become of  you  But let what would have happened you would have met with the humanity you have not shewn whether you had deserved it or not Nor at worst lost either a kind sister or a pitying friend in the most excellent of sisters  But why

was willing to give you a  part  of my mindCall for more of it it shall be at your service From one who tho' she thanks God she is not your  sister  is not your  enemy  But that she is  not  the latter is withheld but by two con∣siderations one that you bear tho' unworthily a rela∣tion to a sister so excellent the other that you are not of consequence enough to engage anything but the pity

of so much prudence and good sense and being a mother yourself can so well enter into the di∣stresses of all our family upon the rashness and ingratitude of a child we once doated upon that I dare say you will not countenance the strange freedoms your daughter has taken with us all These are not the only ones we have to complain of but we were silent on the others as they did not as these have done spread themselves out upon paper We only beg that we may not be reflected up∣on by a young lady who knows not what we have suf∣fered and do suffer by the rashness of a naughty creature who has brought ruin upon herself and disgrace upon a family which she has robbed of all comfort I offer not to prescribe to your known wisdom in this case but leave it to you to do as you think most proper  I am Madam Your most humble Servant  CHARL HARLOWE  LETTER LXIV  Mrs  HOWE  In Answer  Sat July    Dear Madam  I Am highly offended with my daughter's letters to Miss Harlowe I knew nothing at all of her having taken such a liberty These young creatures have such romantic notions some of  love  some of  friendship  that there is no governing them in either Nothing but time and dear experience will convince them of their absurdities in both I have chidden Miss Howe very severely I had before so just a notion of what your whole family's distress must be that as I told your brother Mr Antony Harlowe I had often forbid her corresponding with the poor fallen angelFor surely never did young lady more resemble what we imagine of angels both in person and mind But tired out with her headstrong ways I am sorry to say this of my own child I was forced to give way to it again And indeed so sturdy was she in her will that I was afraid it would end in a fit of sickness as too often it did in fits of sullens  None but parents know the trouble that children give  They are happiest I have often thought who have none And these womengrown girls bless my heart how un∣governable  I believe however you will have no more such letters from my Nancy I have been forced to use compulsion with her upon Miss Clary's illness and it seems she is very bad or she would have run away to London to attend upon her And this she calls doing the duty of a friend forgetting that she sacrifices to her romantic friendship her duty to a fond indulgent mother  There are a thousand excellencies in the poor sufferer notwithstanding her fault And if the hints she has given to my daughter be true she has been most grievously ab∣used But I think your forgiveness and her father's for∣giveness of her ought to be all at your own choice and nobody should intermeddle in that for the sake of due authority in parents And besides as Miss Harlowe writes it was what everybody expected tho' Miss Clary would not believe it till she smarted for her credulity And for these reasons I offer not to plead anything in alle  iation of her fault which is aggravated by her ad∣mirable sense and a judgment above her years  I am Madam with compliments to good Mr Har∣lowe and all your afflicted family  Your most humble Servant  ANNABELLA HOWE  I shall set out for the Isle of Wight in a few days with my daughter I will hasten our settingout on pur∣pose to break her mind from her friend's distresses which afflict us as much nearly as Miss Clary's rash∣ness has done you  LETTER LXV  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Sat July    My dearest Friend  WE are busy in preparing for our little journey and voyage But I will be ill I will be very ill if I cannot hear you are better before I go  Rogers greatly afflicted me by telling me the bad way you are in But now you have been able to hold a pen  and as your sense is strong and clear I hope that the amusement you will receive from writing will make you better  I dispatch this by an extraordinary way that it may reach you time enough to move you to  consider well  before you absolutely decide upon the contents of mine of the th on the subject of the two Misses Montague's visit to me since according to what you write must I answer them  In your last you conclude very positively that you will not be his To be sure he rather deserves an infa∣mous death than such a wife But as I really believe him innocent of the arrest and as all his family are such earnest pleaders and will be guarantees for him I think the compliance with  their  intreaties and  his own  will be now the best step you can take your own family remain∣ing implacable as I  can assure you they do  He is a man of sense and it is not impossible but he may make you a good husband and in time may become no bad man  My mother is intirely of my opinion And on Friday pursuant to a hint I gave you in my last Mr Hickma  had a conference with the strange wretch And tho' he liked not by any means his behaviour to himself no  indeed had reason to do so yet he is of opinion that he is sincerely determined to marry you if you will condescend to have him  Perhaps Mr Hickman may make you a private visit before we set out If I may not attend you myself I shall not be easy except he does And he will then give you an account of the admirable character the surprising wretch gave of you and of the justice he does to your virtue  He was as acknowleging to his relations tho' to his own condemnation as his two cousins told me All that he apprehends as he said to Mr Hickman is that if you go on appealing your case and exposing  him  wed∣lock itself will not wipe off the dishonour to both And moreover  that you would ruin your constitution by your immoderate sorrow and by seeking death when you might avoid it would not be able to escape it when you would wish to do so  So my dearest friend I charge you if you  can  to get over your aversion to this vile man You may yet live to see many happy days and be once more the delight of all your friends neighbours and acquaintance as well as a stay a comfort and a blessing to your Anna Howe  I long to have your answer to mine of the th Pray keep the messenger till it be ready If he return on Monday night it will be time enough for his affairs and to find me come back from Colonel Ambrose's who gives a Ball on the anniversary of Mrs Ambrose's birth and marriage both in one The gentry all round the neigh∣bourhood are invited this time on some good news they have received from Mrs Ambrose's brother the governor  My mother promised the Colonel for me and herself in my absence I would fain have excused myself to her and the rather as I had exceptions on account of the day  The th of July Miss Clarissa Harlowe's anniversary birthday  But she is almost as young as her daughter and thinking it not so well to go without me she told me She could propose  nothing  that was agreeable to me And having had a  few sparring blows  with each other very lately I think I must comply For I don't love  angling when I can help it tho' I seldom make it my study to avoid the occasion when it offers of itself I don't know if either were not a little afraid of the other whether it would be possible that we could live together I  All my father  My mammaWhat  All my mo∣ther  What else should I say  O my dear how many things happen in this life to give us displeasure How few to give us joyI am sure I shall have none on this occasion since the true partner of my heart the principal half of the  one soul  that it used to be said animated  The pair of friends  as we were called YOU my dear who used to irradiate every circle you set your foot into and to give me  real  significance in a  second  place to yourself cannot be thereOne hour of your company my everinstructive friend I thirst for it how infinitely preferable to me to all the diversions and amusements with which our sex are generally most de∣lightedAdieu my dear  A HOWE  LETTER LXVI  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Sunday July    WHAT pain my dearest friend does your kind solicitude for my welfare give me How muc  more binding and tender are the ties of pure friendship and the union of like minds than the ties of nature Well might the Sweet Singer of Israel when he was carry∣ing to the utmost extent the praises of the friendship be∣tween him and his beloved friend say that the love of Jonathan to him was wonderful that it surpassed the  love of women  What an exalted idea does it give of the soul of Jonathan sweetly attemper'd for this sacred band if we may suppose it but equal to that of my Anna Howe for her fallen Clarissa But altho' I can glory in you  kind love for me think my dear what concern  fill a mind not ungenerous when the obligation lies a  on one side And when at the same time that your Light is the brighter for my Darkness I must give pain to a d  friend to whom I delighted to give pleasure and  the same time discredit for supporting my blighted fa  against the busy tongues of uncharitable censurers  This it is that makes me in the words of my admired exclaimer very little altered often repeat  O  I were as in months past as in the days when God preserved me When his candle shined upon my he  and when by his light I walked through darkness As I was in the days of my  childhood  when the Almighty was yet with me when  I was in my father's h  When I washed my steps with butter and the ro  poured me out rivers of oil  You set before me your reasons enforced by the opi∣nion of your honoured mother why I should think  Mr Lovelace for a husband  See the preceding letter    And I have before me your letter of the th  See p    of this Volume  co  ¦taining the account of the visit and proposals and ki  interposition of the two Misses Montague in the name  of the good Ladies Sarah Sadleir and Betty Lawrance and that of Lord M  Also yours of the th  See p    of this Volume    demanding  me as I may say of those ladies and of that family when I was so infamously and cruelly arrested and you knew not what was become of me  The answer likewise of those ladies signed in so full and so generous a manner by themselves  See p    and by that nobleman and those two venerable ladies and in his light way by the wretch himself  These my dearest Miss Howe and your letter of the th  See p    which came when I was under arrest and which I received not till some days after  Are all before me  And I have as well weighed the whole matter and your arguments in support of your advice as at present my head and my heart will let me weigh them  I am moreover willing to believe not only from your own opinion but from the assurances of one of Mr Lovelace's friends Mr Belford a goodnatured and hu∣mane man who spares not to censure the author of my calamities  I think  with undissembled and undesigning sin∣cerity that that man is innocent of the disgraceful arrest  And even if you please in sincere compliment to your opinion and to that of Mr Hickman that overper∣suaded by his friends and ashamed of his unmerited base∣ness to me he in earnest would marry  me  if I would have  him  Those parts of this letter which are marked with inverted comma's thus " were transcribed afterwards by Miss Howe in a letter to the ladies of Mr Lovelace's family dated July and are thus distin∣guished to avoid the necessity of repeating them when that letter comes to be inserted  Well and now what is the result of allIt is thisThat I must abide by what I have already de∣claredAnd that is Don't be angry at me my best friend That I have much more pleasure in thinking of death than of such a husband In short as I declared in my last that I cannotForgive me if I say I  will  notEver be his  But you will expect my reasons I know you will  And if I give them not will conclude me either obsti∣nate or implacable or both And those would be sad imputations if just to be laid to the charge of a per∣son who thinks and talks of  dying  And yet to say that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination would be saying a thing hardly to be credited For I own I  have  resentments strong re∣sentments but not unreasonable ones as you will be convinced if already you are not so when you know all my storyIf ever you do know it For I begin to fear so many things more necessary to be thought of than either this man or my own vindication have I to do that I shall not have time to compass what I have intended and in a manner promised you  See Letter  xxv  p      I have one reason to give in support of my resolu∣tion that I believe yourself will allow of But having owned that I have resentments I will begin with those considerations in which anger and disappointment have too great a share in hopes that having once disbur∣den'd my mind upon paper and to my Anna Howe of those corroding uneasy passions I shall prevent them for ever from returning to my heart and to have their place supplied by better milder and more agreeable ones  My pride then my dearest friend altho' a great deal mortified is not  sufficiently  mortified if it be ne∣cessary for me to submit to make that man my choice whose actions are and ought to be my abhorrence Whatshall I who have been treated with such premeditated and perfidious barbarity as is painful to be thought of and cannot with modesty be described think of taking the violator to my heart Can I vow duty to one so wicked and hazard my salvation by joining myself to so great a profligate now I  know  him to be so Do you think your Clarissa Harlowe so lost so  sunk  at least as that she could for the sake of patching up in the world's eye a broken reputation meanly appear indebted to the generosity or  compassion  perhaps of a man who has by means so inhuman robbed her of it Indeed my dear I should not think  my penitence for the rash step I took any thing better than a specious delusion if I had not got above the least wish to have Mr Lovelace for my husband  Yes I warrant I must  creep  to the violator and be thankful to him for doing me poor justice  Do you not already see me pursuing the advice you give with a downcast eye appear before his friends and before  my own  supposing the latter would at last condescend to own me divested of that  noble confidence  which arises from a mind unconscious of having de∣served reproach  Do you not see me creep about my own house pre∣ferring all my honest maidens to myself as if afraid too to open my lips either by way of reproof or ad∣monition lest their bolder eyes should bid me look in∣ward and not expect perfection from  them  And shall I intitle the wretch to upbraid me with his generosity and his pity and perhaps to reproach me for having been  capable  of forgiving crimes of  such  a nature  I once indeed hoped little thinking him so  premedi∣tatedly  vile a man that I might have the happiness to reclaim him I vainly believed that he loved me well enough to suffer my advice for his good and the ex∣ample I humbly presumed I should be enabled to set him to have weight with him and the rather as he had no mean opinion of my morals and understanding But now what hope is there left for this my  prime  hope  Were  I to marry him what a figure should I make preaching virtue and morality to a man whom I had trusted with opportunities to seduce me from all my own duties And then supposing I were to have children by such a husband must it not think you cut a thoughtful person to the heart to look round upon her little family and think she had given them a fa∣ther destin'd without a miracle to perdition and whose immoralities propagated among them by his vile example might too probably bring down a curse upon them And after all who knows but that my own sinful compliances with a man who would think himself intitled to my obedience might taint my own  morals and make me instead of a reformer an imi∣tator of himFor who  can touch pitch and not be defiled  Let me then repeat that I truly despise this man If I know my own heart indeed I doI pity him  Beneath  my very pity as he is I nevertheless pity him But this I could not do if I still loved him For my dear one must be greatly sensible of the baseness and ingratitude of those we love I love him not there∣fore My soul disdains communion with him  But altho' thus much is due to resentment yet have I not been so far carried away by its angry effects as to be rendered incapable of casting about what I  ought  to do and what  could be done  if the Almighty in order to lengthen the time of my penitence were to bid me to live  The single life at such times has offer'd to me as the life the  only  life to be chosen But in  that  must I not  now  sit brooding over my past afflictions and mourning my faults till the hour of my release And would not everyone be able to assign the reason why Clarissa Harlowe chose solitude and to sequester herself from the world Would not the look of every creature who beheld me appear as a reproach to me And would not my conscious eye confess my fault whether the eyes of others accused me or not One of my delights was to enter the cots of my poor neighbours to leave lessons to the boys and cautions to the elder girls And how should I be able unconscious and without pain to say to the latter Fly the delusions of men who had been supposed to have run away with one  What then my dear and only friend can I wish for but deathAnd what after all  is  death 'Tis but a cessation from mortal life 'Tis but the finishing of an appointed course The refreshing inn after a fatiguing journey The end of a life of cares and troubles and if happy the beginning of a life of immortal happiness  If I die not now it may possibly happen that I may be taken when I am less prepared Had I escaped the evils I labour under it might have been in the  midst of some gay promising hope when my heart had beat high with the desire of life and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me  But now my dear for  your  satisfaction let me say that altho' I wish not for life yet would I not like a poor coward desert my post when I  can  maintain it and when it is my  duty  to maintain it  More than once indeed was I urged by thoughts so sinful But then it was in the height of my distress And once particularly I have reason to believe I saved myself by my desperation from the most shocking per∣sonal insults from a repetition as far as I know▪ of his vileness the base women with so much reason dreaded by me present to intimidate  me  if not to assist  him  O my dear you know not what I suffered on that oc∣casion Nor do I what I  escaped  at the time if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of his vile heart High resolution a cou∣rage I never knew before a settled not a rash cou∣rage and such a command of my passionsI can only say I know not how I came by such an uncommon elevation of mind if it were not given me in answer to my earnest prayers to Heaven for such a com∣mand of myself before I entered into the horrid com∣pany  As I am of opinion that it would have manifested more of revenge and despair than of principle had I committed a violence upon myself when the villainy was  perpetrated  so I should think it equally criminal were I now  wilfully  to neglect myself were I  purposely  to run into the arms of death as that man supposes I shall do when I might avoid it  Nor my dear whatever are the suppositions of such a shortsighted such a lowsouled man must you im∣pute to gloom to melancholy to despondency nor yet to a spirit of faulty pride or still  more  faulty revenge the resolution I have taken never to marry  this  and if not  this any  man So far from deserving this imputation I do assure you my dear and  only  love that I will do everything I can to prolong my life till God in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it I have reason to  think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault and I will not run away from it but beg of Hea∣ven to sanctify it to me When appetite serves I will eat and drink what is sufficient to support nature A very little you know will do for that And whatever my physicians shall think fit to prescribe I will take though ever so disagreeable In short I will do everything I can do to convince all my friends who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my last beha∣viour that I possessed my soul with tolerable patience and endeavoured to bear with a lot of my own drawing For thus in humble imitation of the sublimest exemplar I often sayLord it is thy will and it shall be mine Thou art just in all thy dealings with the children of men and I know thou wilt not afflict me beyond what I can bear And if I  can  bear it I  ought  to bear it and thy grace assisting me I  will  bear it  But here my dear is another reason a reason that will convince you yourself that I ought not to think of wedlock but of a quite different preparation I am persuaded as much as that I am now alive that I shall not long live The strong sense I have ever had of my fault the loss of my reputation my disappointments the determined resentment of my friends  aiding  the barbarous usage I have met with where I least deserved it have seized upon my heart Seized upon it before it was so well fortified by  religious considerations  as I hope it now is Don't be concerned my dearBut I am sure if I may say it with as little presumption as grief in the words of Job That God will soon  dissolve my substance  and  bring me to death and to the house ap∣pointed for all living  And now my dearest friend you know all my mind And you will be pleased to write to the ladies of Mr Love∣lace's family That I think myself infinitely obliged to them for their good opinion of me and that it has given me greater pleasure than I thought I had to come in this life that upon the little knowlege they have of me and that not personal I was thought worthy after the ill usage I have received of an alliance with their honourable fa∣mily But that I can by no means think of their kinsman  for a husband And do you my dear extract from the above such reasons as you think have any weight in them  I would write myself to acknowlege their favour had I not more employment for my head my heart and my fingers than I doubt they will be able to go through  I should be glad to know when you set out on your journey as also your little stages and your time of stay at your aunt Harman's that my prayers may locally at∣tend you whithersoever you go and whereever you are  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXVII  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Sunday July    THE letter accompanying This being upon a very pe∣culiar subject I would not embarass it as I may say with any other And yet having some further matters upon my mind which will want your excuse for directing them to you I hope the following lines will  have  that excuse  My good Mrs Norton so long ago as in a letter dated the d of this month  See p    of this Volume  hinted to me that my relations took amiss some severe things you was pleased in love to me to say of them Mrs Norton mentioned it with that respectful love which she bears to my dearest friend But wished for  my  sake that you would rein  in a vivacity which on most other occasions so charmingly becomes you This was her sense You know that  I  am war∣ranted to speak and write freer to my Anna Howe than Mrs Norton would do  I durst not mention it to you at that time because ap∣pearances were  so  strong against me on Mr Lovelace's getting me again into his power after my escape to Hamstead as made you very angry with me when you answered mine on my second escape And soon after∣wards I was put under that barbarous arrest so that I could not well touch upon that subject till now  Now therefore my dearest Miss Howe let me  repeat  my earnest request for This is not the first time by seve∣ral that I have been obliged to chide you on this occasion  That you will spare my parents and other relations in all your conversations about meIndeed I wish they had thought fit to take other measures with me But who shall judge for themThe event has justified them and con∣demned me They expected nothing good of this vile man  he  has not therefore deceived  them  But they expected other things from  me  and  I  have And they have the more reason to be set against me if as my aunt Hervey wrote formerly  See Vol  III  Letter  L  p    they intended not to force my inclina∣tions in favour of Mr Solmes and if they believe that my going off was the effect of choice and premeditation  I have no desire to be received to favour by them For why should I sit down to wish for what I have no reason to expect Besides I could not look them in the face if they  would  receive me Indeed I could not All I have to hope for is first that my father will absolve me from his heavy malediction And next for a last blessing The obtaining of these favours are needful to my peace of mind  I have written to my sister but have only mentioned the absolution  I am afraid I shall receive a very harsh answer from her My fault in the eyes of my family is of so enor∣mous a nature that my  first  application will hardly be encouraged Then they know not nor perhaps will believe that I am so very ill as I am So that were I actually to die before they could have time to take the ne∣cessary informations you must not blame them too severe∣ly You must call it a Fatality I know not what you must call it For alas I have made them as miserable as I am myself And yet sometimes I think that were they chearfully to pronounce me forgiven I know not whe∣ther my concern for having offended them would not be augmented Since I imagine that nothing can be more wounding to a spirit not ungenerous than a  generous for∣giveness  I hope your mamma will permit our correspondence for  one  month more altho' I do not take her advice as to having this man Only for  one  month I will not desire it longer When catastrophes are consummating what  changes changes that make one's heart shudder to think of may  one  short month produceBut if she will not why then my dear it becomes us both to acquiesce  You can't think what my apprehensions would have been had I known Mr Hickman was to have had a meet∣ing on such a questioning occasion as must have been his errand from you with that haughty and uncontroulable man  You give me hope of a visit from him Let him  expect  to see me greatly altered I know he loves me For he loves everyone whom you love A painful interview I doubt But I shall be glad to see a man whom  you  will one day and an  early  day I hope make happy and whose gentle manners and unbounded love for you will make  you  so if it be not your own fault  I am my dearest kindest friend the sweet companion of my happy hours the friend ever dearest and nearest to my fond heart  Your equally obliged and faithful  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXVIII  Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday July    EXcuse my dearest young Lady my long silence I have been extremely ill My poor boy has also been at death's door and when I hoped that he was better he has relapsed Alas my dear he is very dangerously ill Let us both have your prayers  Very angry letters have passed between your sister and Miss Howe Everyone of your family is incensed against that young lady I wish you would remonstrate against her warmth since it can do no good for they will not believe but that her interposition has your con∣nivance nor that you are so ill as Miss Howe assures them you are  Before she wrote they were going to send up young Mr Brand the clergyman to make private inquiries of your health and way of lifeBut now they are so exas∣perated that they have laid aside their intention  We have flying reports here and at HarlowePlace of  some fresh insults which you have undergone And that you are about to put yourself into Lady Betty Lawrance's protection I believe they would now be glad as I should be that you would do so and this perhaps will make them suspend for the present any determination in your favour  How unhappy am I that the dangerous way my son is in prevents my attendance on you Let me beg of you to write me word how you are both as to person and mind A servant of Sir Robert Beachcroft who rides post on his master's business to town will present you with this and perhaps will bring me the favour of a few lines in return He will be obliged to stay in town several hours for an answer to his dispatches  This is the anniversary that used to give joy to as many as had the pleasure and honour of knowing you May the Almighty bless you and grant that it may be the only unhappy one that may be ever known by you my dearest young Lady and by  Your everaffectionate  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER LXIX  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON  Monday night July    My dear Mrs  NORTON  HAD I not fallen into fresh troubles which disabled me for several days from holding a pen I should not have forborn inquiring after your health and that of your son for I should have been but too ready to impute your own silence to the cause to which to my very great concern I find it was owing I pray to Heaven my dear good friend to give you comfort in the way most desire∣able to yourself  I am exceedingly concerned at Miss Howe's writing about me to my friends I do assure you that I was as ignorant of her intention so to do as of the contents of her letter Nor has she yet let me know discouraged I suppose by her ill success that she  did  write Impossi∣ble to share the delight which such charming spirits give  without the inconvenience that will attend their volatility So mixed are our best enjoyments  It was but yesterday that I wrote to chide the dear crea∣ture for freedoms of that nature which her unseasonable love for me had made her take as you wrote me word in your former I was afraid that all such freedoms would be attributed to  me  And I am sure that nothing but my own application to my friends and a full conviction of my contrition will procure me favour Least of all can I expect that either your mediation or hers both of whose fond and partial love of me is so well known will avail me  She then gives a brief account of the arrest Of her dejection under it Of her apprehensions of being carried to her former lodgings Of Mr Lovelace's avowed innocence as to that insult Of her release by Mr Belford Of Mr Lovelace's promise not to molest her Of her cloaths being sent her Of the earnest desire of all his friends and of himself to marry her Of Miss Howe's advice to comply with their requests And of her declared resolution rather to die than be his sent to Miss Howe to be given to his relations but as yesterday After which she thus proceeds  Now my dear Mrs Norton you will be surprised perhaps that I should have returned such an answer But when you have everything before you you who know me so well will not think me wrong And besides I am upon a better preparation than for an earthly husband  Nor let it be imagined my dear and evervenerable friend that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloomi∣ness or melancholy for altho' it was  brought on  by disap∣pointment the world shewing me early even at my first  rushing  into it its true and ugly face yet I hope that it has obtained a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has  I have written to my sister Last Friday I wrote So the dye is thrown I hope for a gentle answer But per∣haps they will not vouchsafe me  any  It is my  first  di∣rect application you know I wish Miss Howe had left me to my own workings in this tender point  It will be a great satisfaction to me to hear of your perfect recovery and that my fosterbrother is out of danger But why said I  out of danger  When can  this  be justly said of creatures who hold by so uncertain a te∣nure  This is one of those forms of common speech that proves the  frailty  and the  presumption  of poor mortals at the same time  Don't be uneasy you cannot answer your wishes to be with me I am happier than I could have expected to be among mere strangers It was grievous at first but use reconciles everything to us The people of the house where I am are courteous and honest There is a widow who lodges in it have I not said so formerly a good woman who is the better for having been a proficient in the school of affliction  An excellent school my dear Mrs Norton in which we are taught to know ourselves to be able to compas∣onate and bear with one another and to look up to a better hope  I have as humane a physician whose fees are his least regard and as worthy an apothecary as ever patient was visited by My nurse is diligent obliging silent and sober So I am not unhappy  without  And  within  I hope my dear Mrs Norton that I shall be every day more and more happy  within  No doubt it would be one of the greatest comforts I could know to have you with me You who love me so dearly Who have been the watchful sustainer of my helpless infancy You by whose precepts I have been so much benefited In your dear bosom could I repose all my griefs And by your piety and experience in the ways of Heaven should I be strengthened in what I am still to go through  But as it must not be I will acquiesce and so I hope will you For you see in what respects I am  not  unhappy and in those that I  am  they lie not in your power to remedy  Then as I have told you I have all my cloaths in my own possession So I am rich enough as to this world▪ and in common conveniencies  So you see my venerable and dear friend that I am not always turning the dark side of my prospects in order to move compassion a trick imputed to me too often by my hardhearted sister when if I know my own heart it is above all trick or artifice Yet I hope at last I shall be so happy as to receive  benefit  rather than  reproach  from this talent if it  be  my talent At  last  I say for whose heart have I  hitherto  moved Not one I am sure that was not  predetermined  in my favour  As to the dayI have passed it as I ought to pass it It has been a very heavy day to meMore for my friends sake too than for my own How did  they  use to pass it What a Gala How have they now passed it To  imagine  it how grievousSay not that those are cruel who suffer so much for my fault and who for eighteen years together rejoiced in me and rejoiced me by their indulgent goodnessBut I will  think  the rest Adieu my dearest Mrs NortonAdieu  LETTER LXX  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Miss  ARAB HARLOWE  Friday July    IF my dearest Sister I did not think the state of my health very precarious and that it was my duty to take this step I should hardly have dared to approach you altho' but with my pen after having found your censures so dreadfully justified as they have been  I have not the courage to write to my father himself nor yet to my mother And it is with trembling that I address myself to you to beg of you to intercede for me that my father will have the goodness to revoke that hea∣viest part of the very heavy curse he laid upon me which relates to HEREAFTER For as to the HERE  I have  indeed  met with my punishment from the very wretch in whom I was supposed to place my confidence  As I hope not for restoration to favour I may be al∣lowed to be very earnest on this head Yet will I not use any arguments in support of my request because I am sure my father cannot wish to have his poor child miserable for ever  I have the most grateful sense of my mother's goodness in sending me up my cloaths I would have acknowleged the favour the moment I received them with the most thankful duty but that I feared any line from me would be unacceptable  I would not give fresh offence So will decline all other commendations of duty and love appealing to my heart  for both where  both  are flaming with an ardour that no∣thing but death can extinguish Therefore only subscribe myself without so much as a name  My dear and happy Sister  Your afflicted Servant  A letter directed for me at Mr Smith's a glover in Kingstreet Coventgarden will come to hand  LETTER LXXI  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    In answer to his Letters Num  LIVLVII  Edgware  Monday July    WHAT pains thou takest to persuade thyself that the lady's ill health is owing to the vile arrest and to her friends implacableness Both primarily if they were to be laid at thy door What poor excuses will good heads make for the evils they are put upon by bad hearts But 'tis no wonder that he who can sit down premeditatedly to do a bad action will content himself with a bad excuse And yet what fools must he suppose the rest of the world to be if he imagines them as easily to be imposed upon as he can impose upon himself  In vain dost thou impute to pride or wilfulness the ne∣cessity to which thou hast reduced this lady of parting with her cloaths For can she do otherwise and be the nobleminded creature she is  Her implacable friends have refused her the current cash she left behind her and wished as her sister wrote to her to see her reduced to want Probably therefore they will not be sorry that she is reduced to such streights and will take it for a justification from Heaven of their wicked hardheartedness Thou canst not suppose she would take sup∣plies from thee To take them from me would in her opinion be taking them from thee Miss Howe's mother is an avaritious woman and perhaps the daughter could do nothing of that sort unknown to her and if she  could  is too noble a girl to deny it if charged And then Miss Harlowe is firmly of opinion that she shall never want nor wear the things she disposes of  Having heard nothing from town that obliges me to go thither I shall gratify poor Belton with my company till  tomorrow or perhaps till Wednesday For the unhappy man is more and more loth to part with me I shall soon set out for Epsom to endeavour to serve him there and re∣instate him in his own house Poor fellow he is most horribly lowspirited mopes about and nothing diverts him I pity him at my heart but can do him no good What consolation can I give him either from his past life or from his future prospects  Our friendships and intimacies Lovelace are only cal∣culated for strong life and health When sickness comes we look round us and upon one another like frighted birds at the sight of a kite ready to souse upon them Then with all our bravery what miserable wretches are we  Thou tellest me that thou seest reformation is coming swiftly upon me I hope it is I see so much difference in the behaviour of this admirable woman in  her  illness and that of poor Belton in  his  that it is plain to me the sin∣ner is the real coward and the saint the true hero and sooner or later we shall all find it to be so if we are not cut off suddenly  The lady shut herself up at six o'clock yesterday after∣noon and intends not to see company till seven or eight this not even her nurse imposing upon herself a severe fast And why It is her birthday Blooming yet declining in her blossom Every birth  day till this no doubt happy What must be her reflections What ought to be thine  What sport dost thou make with my aspirations and my prostrations as thou callest them and with my drop∣ping of the bank note behind her chair I had too much awe of her at the time and too much apprehended her displeasure at the offer to make it with the grace that would better have become my intention But the action if aukward was modest Indeed the fitter subject for ridicule with thee who canst no more taste the beauty and delicacy of modest obligingness than of modest love For the same may be said of inviolable respect that the poet says of unfeigned affection  I  speak  I know not what  Speak ever so and if I  answer  you  I know not what it shews the more of love  Love is a child that talks in broken language▪  Yet then it speaks most plain▪  The like may be pleaded in behalf of that modest re∣spect which made the humble offerer afraid to invade the awful eye or the revered hand but aukwardly to drop its incense beside the altar it should have been laid upon But how should that soul which could treat delicacy it∣self brutally know anything of this  But I am still more amazed at thy courage to think of throwing thyself in the way of Miss Howe and Miss Ara∣bella Harlowe Thou wilt not dare surely to carry this thought into execution  As to  my  dress and  thy  dress I have only to say That the sum total of thy observation is this That  my  outside is the  worst  of me and  thine  the  best  of thee And what gettest thou by the comparison Do thou reform the one and I'll try to mend the other I challenge thee to begin  Mrs Lovick gave me at my request the copy of a me∣ditation she shewed me which was extracted by the lady from the Scriptures while under arrest at Rowland's as appears by the date She is not to know that she has taken such a liberty  You and I always admired the noble simplicity and natural ease and dignity of style which are the distinguish∣ing characteristics of these books whenever any passages from them by way of quotation in the works of other authors popt upon us And once I remember you even  you  observed that those passages always appeared to you like a rich vein of golden ore which runs thro' baser me∣tals embellishing the work they were brought to authen∣ticate  Try Lovelace if thou canst relish a divine beauty I think it must strike transient if not permanent remorse into thy heart Thou boastest of thy ingenuity let this be the test of it and whether thou canst be serious on a subject so deep the occasion of it resulting from thyself  MEDITATION  Saturday July  O That my grief were thoroughly weighed and my cala∣mity laid in the balance together  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea Therefore my words are swallowed up  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me the poison  whereof drinketh up my spirit The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me  When I lie down I say When shall I arise When will the night be gone And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and are spent without hopeMine eye shall no more see good  Wherefore is light given to  her  that  is  in misery and life unto the bitter in soul  Who longeth for death but it cometh not and diggeth for it more than for hid treasures  Why is light given to  one  whose way is hid and whom God hath hedged in  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me  I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet Yet trouble came  O that my words were now written O that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the book for ever  I have a little leisure and am in a scribbling vein In∣dulge me Lovelace a few reflections on these sacred books  We are taught to read the Bible when children and as a rudiment only and as far as I know this may be the reason why we think ourselves above it when at a ma∣turer age For you know that our parents as well as we wisely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to and not by our understanding what we have passed through But in my uncle's illness I had the curio∣sity in some of my dull hours lighting upon one in his closet to dip into it And then I found where ever I turned that there were  admirable things in it  I have borrowed one on receiving from Mrs Lovick the above meditations for I had a mind to compare them by the book hardly believing they could be so exceedingly ap∣posite as I find they are And one time or other it is very likely that I shall make a resolution to give it a thorough perusal by way of  course  as I may say  This mean time I will venture to repeat is certain that the style is that truly easy simple and natural one which we should admire in other authors excessively Then all the world join in an opinion of its antiquity and au∣thenticity  too and the learned are fond of strengthening their different arguments by its sanctions Indeed I was so much taken with it at my uncle's that I was half ashamed that it appeared so  new  to me And yet I cannot but say that I have some of the Old Testament history as it is cal∣led in my head But perhaps am more obliged for it to Josephus than to the Bible itself  Odd enough with all our pride of learning that we choose to derive the little we know from the undercur∣rents perhaps muddy ones too when the clear the pel∣lucid fountainhead is much nearer at hand and easier to be come at Slighted the more possibly for that very reason  But man is a pragmatical foolish creature and the more we look into him the more we must despise himLords of the creationWho can forbear indignant laughter When we see not one of the individuals of that creation except his perpetually excentric self but acts within its own natural and original appointments And all the time proud and vain as the conceited wretch is of fancied and selfdependent excellence he is obliged not only for the or∣naments but for the necessaries of life that is to say for food as well as raiment to all the other creatures strutting with their blood and spirits in his veins and with their plumage on his back For what has he of his own but a very mis∣chievous monkeylike bad nature Yet thinks himself at liberty to kick and cuff and elbow out every worthier creature And when he has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abuse will make use of his power his strength or his wealth to oppress the less powerful and weaker of his own species  When you and I meet next let us enter more largely into this subject And I dare say we shall take it by turns in imitation of the two sages of antiquity to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what miserable yet con∣ceited beings men in general but we libertines in particu∣lar are  I fell upon a piece at Dorrell's this very evening inti∣tled  The sacred Classics  written by one Blackwall  I took it home with me and had not read a dozen pages when I was convinced that I ought to be ashamed of my∣self to think how greatly I have admired less noble and  less natural beauties in pagan authors while I have known nothing of this allexcelling collection of beauties the Bible By my faith Lovelace I shall for the future have a better opinion of the good sense and taste of half a score parsons whom I have fallen in with in my time and despised for  magnifying  as I thought they did the language and the sentiments to be found in it in preference to all the antient poets and philosophers And this is now a convincing proof to me and shames as much an infidel's presumption a  his ignorance that those who know least are the great∣est scoffers A pretty pack of wouldbewits of us who censure without knowlege laugh without reason and are most noisy and loud against things we know least of  LETTER LXXII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday July    I Came not to town till this morning early poor Belton clinging to me as a man destitute of all other hold  I hastened to Smith's and had but a very indifferent account of the lady's health I sent up my compliments and she desired to see me in the afternoon  Mrs Lovick told me that after I went away on Satur∣day she actually parted with one of her best suits of cloaths to a gentlewoman who is her Mrs Lovick's benefactress and who bought them for a niece who is very speedily to be married and whom she fits out and portions as her in∣tended heiress The lady was so jealous that the money might come from you or me that she would see the pur∣chaser Who owned to Mrs Lovick that she bought them for half their worth But yet tho' her conscience permit∣ted her to take them at such an underrate the widow says her friend admired the lady as one of the loveliest of her sex And having been let into a little of her story could not help tears at taking away her purchase  She may be a good sort of woman Mrs Lovick says she  is  But SELF is an odious devil that reconciles to some people the most cruel and dishonest actions But nevertheless it is my opinion that those who can suf∣fer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their  fellowcreatures in order to buy any thing at a less rate than would allow them the legal interest of their purchasemoney supposing they purchase  before they want  are no better than robbers for the difference To plunder a wreck and to rob at a fire are indeed higher degrees of wickedness But do not these as well as the others heighten the distresses of the distressed and heap more misery on the miserable whom it is the duty of every one to relieve  About three o'clock I went again to Smith's The lady was writing when I sent up my name but admitted of my visit I saw a visible alteration in her countenance for the worse and Mrs Lovick respectfully accusing her of too great assiduity to her pen early and late and of her abstinence the day before I took notice of the alteration and told her that her physician had greater hopes of her than she had of herself and I would take the liberty to say that despair of recovery allowed not room for cure  She said She neither despaired nor hoped Then step∣ping to the glass with great composure My countenance says she is indeed an honest picture of my heart But the mind will run away with the body at any time  Writing is all my diversion continued she and I have subjects that cannot be dispensed with As to my hours I have always been an early riser But now Rest is less in my power than ever Sleep has a long time ago quarrelled with me and will not be friends altho' I have made the first advances What  will  be  must  She then stept to her closet and brought to me a parcel sealed up with three seals Be so kind said she as to give This to your friend A very grateful present it ought to be to him For Sir this packet contains all his letters to me Such letters they are as compared with his actions would reflect dishonour upon all his Sex were they to fall into other hands  As to my letters to him they are not many He may either keep or destroy them as he pleases  I thought I ought not to forego this opportunity to plead for you I therefore with the packet in my hand urged all the arguments I could think of in your favour  She heard me out with more attention than I could have promised myself considering her determin'd resolution  I would not interrupt you Mr Belford said she tho' I am far from being pleased with the subject of your discourse The motives for your pleas in his favour are generous I love to see instances of generous friendship in either Sex But I have written my full mind on this subject to Miss Howe who will communicate it to the ladies of his fa∣mily No more therefore I pray you upon a topic that may lead to disagreeable recriminations  Her apothecary came in He advised her to the air and blamed her for so great an application as he was told she made to her pen and he gave it as the Doctor's opi∣nion as well as his own that she would recover if she herself desired to recover and would use the means  The lady may indeed write too much for her health perhaps But I have observed on several occasions that when the physical men are at a loss what to prescribe they forbid their patients what they best like and are most di∣verted with  But nobleminded as they see this lady is they know not half her nobleness of mind nor how deeply she is wounded and depend too much upon her  youth  which I doubt will not do in this case and upon  time  which will not alleviate the woes of such a mind For having been bent upon doing good and upon reclaiming a libertine whom she loved she is disappointed in all her darling views and will never be able I fear to look up with satisfaction enough in herself to make life desirable to her For this lady had  other  views in living than the common ones of eating sleeping dressing visiting and those other fa∣shionable amusements which fill up the time of most of her Sex especially of those of it who think themselves fitted to shine in and adorn polite assemblies Her grief in short seems to me to be of such a nature that  time  which alleviates most other persons afflictions will as the poet says  give increase to hers  Thou Lovelace mightest have seen all this superior ex∣cellence as thou wentest along In every word in every sentiment in every action is it visible But thy cursed inventions and intriguing spirit ran away with thee 'Tis fit that the subject of thy wicked boast and of talents so egre∣giously misapplied should be  thy  punishment and thy curse  Mr Goddard took his leave and I was going to do so too when the maid came up and told her a gentleman was below who very earnestly inquired after her health and desired to see her His name Hickman  She was overjoyed and bid the maid desire the gentle∣man to walk up  I would have withdrawn but I suppose she thought it was likely I should have met him upon the stairs and so she forbid it  She shot to the stairshead to receive him and taking his hand asked half a dozen questions without waiting for any answer in relation to Miss Howe's health ac∣knowleging in high terms her goodness in sending him to see her before she set out upon her little journey  He gave her a letter from that young lady which she put into her bosom saying She would read it byandby  He was visibly shocked to see how ill she looked  You look at me with concern Mr Hickman said sheOh Sir times are strangely alter'd with me since I saw you last at my dear Miss Howe'sWhat a chearful creature was I thenMy heart at rest My prospects charming And beloved by everybodyBut I will not pain you  Indeed Madam said he I am grieved for you at my soul  He turned away his face with visible grief in it  Her own eyes glisten'd But she turned to each of us presenting one to the other Him to me as a gentleman  truly  deserving to be  called so  Me to him as  your  friend indeed How was I at that instant ashamed of myself but nevertheless as a man of humanity detesting my friend's baseness and desirous of doing her all manner of good offices  Mr Hickman received my civilities with a coldness which however was rather to be expected on your ac∣count than that it deserved exception on mine And the lady invited us both to breakfast with her in the morning he being obliged to return next day  I left them together and called upon Mr Dorrell my attorney to consult him upon poor Belton's affairs and then went home and wrote thus far preparative to what may occur in my breakfastingvisit in the morning  LETTER LXXIII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday July    I Went this morning according to the lady's invitation to breakfast and found Mr Hickman with her  A good deal of heaviness and concern hung upon his countenance but he received me with more respect than he did yesterday which I presume was owing to the lady's favourable character of me  He spoke very little for I suppose they had all their talk out yesterday and before I came this morning  By the hints that dropped I perceived that Miss Howe's letter gave an account of your interview with her at Col Ambrose'sof your professions to Miss Howe and Miss Howe's opinion that marrying you was the only way now left to repair her wrongs  Mr Hickman as I also gathered had press'd her in Miss Howe's name to let her find her on her return from the Isle of Wight at a neighbouring farmhouse where neat apartments would be made ready to receive her She asked How long it would be before they returned And he told her It was proposed to be no more than a fort∣night out and in Upon which she said She should then perhaps have time to consider of that kind proposal  He had tender'd her money from Miss Howe but could not induce her to take any No wonder I was re∣fused She only said That if she had occasion she would be obliged to nobody but Miss Howe  Mr Goddard her apothecary came in before break∣fast was over At her desire he sat down with us Mr Hickman asked him If he could give him any consolation in relation to Miss Harlowe's recovery to carry down to a lady who loved her as she loved her own life  The lady said he will do very well if she will re∣solve upon it herself Indeed you  will  Madam The Doctor is intirely of this opinion and has ordered no∣thing for you but weak jellies and innocent cordials lest you should starve yourself And let me tell you Madam that so much watching so little nourishment and so much  grief as you seem to indulge is enough to impair the most vigorous health and to wear out the strongest constitution  What Sir said she can I do I have no appetite Nothing you call nourishing will stay on my stomach I do what I can And have such kind directors in Dr H and you that I should be inexcusable if I did not  I'll give you a regimen Madam replied he which I am sure the Doctor will approve of and will make phy∣sic unnecessary in your case And that is  Go to rest at ten at night Rise not till seven in the morning Let your breakfast be watergruel or milkpottage or weak broths Your dinner anything you like so you will  but  eat A dish of tea with milk in the afternoon and sagoe for your supper And my life for yours this diet and a month's countryair will set you up  We were much pleased with the worthy gentleman's disinterested regimen And she said referring to her nurse who vouched for her Pray Mr Hickman let Miss Howe know the good hands I am in And as to the kind charge of the gentleman assure her that all I pro∣mised to her in the longest of my two last letters on the subject of my health I do and will to the utmost of my power observe I have engaged Sir to Mr Goddard I have engaged Sir to me to Miss Howe to avoid all wilful neglects It would be an unpardonable fault and very ill become the character I would be glad to deserve or the temper of mind I wish my friends hereafter to think me mistress of if I did not  Mr Hickman and I went afterwards to a neighbour∣ing coffeehouse and he gave me some account of your behaviour at the Ball on Monday night and of your treatment of him in the conference he had with you be∣fore that which he represented in a more favourable light than you had done yourself And yet he gave his sentiments of you with great freedom but with the politeness of a gentleman  He told me how very determined the lady was against marrying you that she had early this morning set her∣self to write a letter to Miss Howe in answer to one he brought her which he was to call for at twelve it being  almost finished before he saw her at breakfast and that at three he proposed to set out on his return  He told me that Miss Howe and her mother and himself were to begin their little journey for the Isle of Wight on Monday next But that he must make the most favourable representation of Miss Harlowe's bad health or they should have a very uneasy absence He expressed the pleasure he had in finding the lady in such good hands Proposed to call on Dr H to take his opinion whether it was likely she would recover and hoped he should find it favourable  As he was resolved to make the best of the matter and as the lady had refused to accept of money offered by Mr Hickman I said nothing of her parting with her cloaths I thought it would serve no other end to men∣tion it but to shock Miss Howe For it has such a sound with it that a lady of her rank and fortune should be so reduced that I cannot myself think of it with patience nor know I but  one  man in the world who can  This gentleman is a little finical and formal but I think him an agreeable sensible man and not at all de∣serving of the treatment or the character you give him  But you are really a strange mortal Because you have advantages in your person in your air and intellect above all the men I know and a face that would deceive the devil you can't think any man else tolerable  It is upon this modest principle that thou deridest some of us who not having thy confidence in their outside appearance seek to hide their defects by the taylor's and perukemaker's assistance Mistakenly enough if it be really done so absurdly as to expose them more and sayst That we do but hang out a sign in our dress of what we have in the shop of our minds This no doubt thou thinkest is smartly observed But pr'ythee Love∣lace tell me if thou canst What sort of a sign must thou hang out wert thou obliged to give us a clear idea by it of the furniture of  thy  mind  Mr Hickman tells me He should have been happy with Miss Howe some weeks ago for all the settlements have been some time engrossed but that she will not marry she declares while her dear friend is so unhappy  This is truly a charming instance of the force of  female friendship  which you and I and our brother rakes have constantly ridiculed as a chimerical and impossible thing in ladies of equal age rank and perfections  But really Lovelace I see more and more that there are not in the world with all our conceited pride nar∣rowersoul'd wretches than we Rakes and Libertines are And I'll tell thee how it comes about  Our early love of roguery makes us generally run away from instruction and so we become mere smatterers in the sciences we are put to learn and because we  will  know no more think there is no more to be  known  With an infinite deal of vanity unreined imaginations and no judgments at all we next commence  halfwits  and then think we have the whole field of knowlege in possession and despise every one who takes more pains and is more serious than ourselves as phlegmatic stupid fellows who have no taste for the most poignant pleasures of life  This makes us insufferable to men of modesty and merit and obliges us to herd with those of our own cast and by this means we have no  opportunities  of seeing or conversing with anybody who could or would shew us what we are and so we conclude that we are the cleverest fellows in the world and the only men of spirit in it and looking down with supercilious eyes on all who give not themselves the liberties we take imagine the world made for us and for us only  Thus as to useful knowlege while others go to the bottom we only skim the surface are despised by people of solid sense of true honour and superior talents and shutting our eyes move round and round like so many blind mill horses in one narrow circle while we ima∣gine we have all the world to range in  I THREW myself in Mr Hickman's way on his return from the lady and we took a small repast at the Le∣beck's Head in Chandosstreet  He was excessively moved at taking leave of her being afraid as he said to me tho' he would not tell her so that he should never see her again She charged him  to represent everything to Miss Howe in the most favour∣able light that the truth would bear  He told me of a tender passage at parting which was that having saluted her at her closetdoor he could not help once more taking the same liberty in a more fervent man∣ner at the stairshead whither she accompanied him and this in the thought that it was the last time he should ever have that honour and offering to apologize for his free∣dom for he had press'd her to his heart with a vehemence that he could neither account for or resistExcuse you Mr Hickman that I will You are my brother and my friend And to shew you that the good man who is to be happy with my beloved Miss Howe is very dear to me you shall carry to her this token of my love offering her sweet face to his salute and pressing his hand between hers and perhaps her love of  me  will make it more agreeable to her than her punctilio would otherwise allow it to be And tell her said she dropping on one knee with clasped hands and uplifted eyes that in this posture you see me in the last moment of our parting begging a blessing upon you both and that you may be the delight and comfort of each other for many very many happy years  Tears said he fell from my eyes I even sobb'd with mingled joy and sorrow and she retreating as soon as I raised her I went down stairs highly dissatisfied with my∣self for going yet unable to stay my eyes fixed the con∣trary way to my feet as long as I could behold the skirts of her raiment  I went into the backshop continued the worthy man and recommended the angelic lady to the best care of Mrs Smith and when I was in the street cast my eye up at her window There for the last time I doubt said he that I shall ever behold her I saw her and she waved her charming hand to me and with such a look of smiling goodness and mingled concern as I cannot describe  Pr'ythee tell me thou vile Lovelace if thou hast not a notion even from these jejune descriptions of mine as I have from reflecting upon the occasion that there must be a more exalted pleasure in intellectual friendship than ever thou couldst taste in the grosser fumes of senssuality And whether it may not be possible for thee in time to  give that preference to the  infinitely  preferable which I hope now that I shall always give  I will leave thee to make the most of this reflection from  Thy true friend  J BELFORD  LETTER LXXIV  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Tuesday July    YOUR two affecting letters were brought to me as I had directed any letter from you should be to the Colonel's about an hour before we broke up I could not forbear dipping into them there and shedding more tears over them than I will tell you of altho' I dried my eyes as well as I could that the company I was obliged to return to and my mamma should see as little of my concern as possible  I am yet and was then still more excessively flutter'd The occasion I will communicate to you byandby For nothing but the flutters given by the stroke of death could divert my  first  attention from the sad and solemn contents of your last favour These therefore I must begin with  How can I bear the thoughts of losing so dear a friend I will not so much as suppose it Indeed I  cannot  Such a mind as yours was not vested in humanity to be snatch'd away from us so soon There must be still a great deal for you to do for the good of all who have the happiness to know you  You enumerate in your letter of Thursday last  Letter  L  p    the particulars in which your situation is already mended Let me see by effects that you are in earnest in that enu∣meration and that you really have the courage to resolve to get above the sense of injuries you could not avoid and then will I trust to Providence and my humble prayers for your perfect recovery And glad at my heart shall I be on my return from the little Island to find you well enough to be near us according to the proposal Mr Hickman has to make you  You chide me in yours of Sunday on the freedom I take with your friends  See p      I  may  be warm I know I  am  Too warm Yet warmth in friendship surely cannot be a crime especi∣ally when our friend has great merit labours under op∣pression and is struggling with undeserved calamity  I have no notion of coldness in friendship be it dignified or distinguished by the name of  prudence  or what it will  You  may excuse your relations It was ever your way to do so But my dear other people must be allowed to judge as they please I am not their daughter nor the sister of your brother and sisterI thank Heaven I am not  But if you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention I am afraid if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon that you would be still  more  concerned But they have been even with me But I must not tell you all I hope however that these  unforgivers  my mother is among them were always good dutiful passive children to  their  parents  Once more forgive me I owned I was too warm▪ But I have no example to the contrary but from You And the treatment you meet with is very little encourage∣ment to me to endeavour to imitate you in your dutiful meekness  You leave it to me to give a negative to the hopes of the noble family whose only disgrace is that so very vile a man is so nearly related to them But yetAlas my dear I am so fearful of consequences of  selfishly  fearful if this negative  must  be givenI don't know what I should say But give me leave to suspend however this negative till I hear from you again  Their earnest courtship of you into their splendid fa∣mily is so  very  honourable to youThey  so justly  admire youYou must have had such a  noble triumph  over the base man He is so  much  in earnestThe world knows so  much  of the unhappy affairYou may do  still  so  much  goodYour will is  so  inviolate Your relations are  so  implacableThink my dear and  re  think  And let me leave you to do so while I give you the oc∣casion of the flutter I mentioned at the beginning of this letter in the conclusion of which you will find the ob∣ligation  I have consented to lay myself under to refer this important point once more to your discussion before I give in your name the negative that cannot when given be with honour to yourself repented of or recalled  KNOW then my dear that I accompanied my mother to Colonel Ambrose's on the occasion I mentioned to you in my former Many ladies and gentlemen were there whom you know particularly Miss Kitty D'Oily Miss Lloyd Miss Biddy D'Ollyffe Miss Biddulph and their respective admirers with the Colonel's two nieces fine women both besides many whom you know not for they were strangers to me but by name A splendid company and all pleased with one another till Colonel Ambrose introduced one who the moment he was brought into the great hall set the whole assemblée into a kind of agitation  It was your villain  I thought I should have sunk as soon as I set my eyes upon him My mother was also affected and coming to me Nancy whisper'd she can you bear the sight of that wretch without too much emotion If not with∣draw into the next apartment  I could not remove Everybody's eyes were glanced from him to me I sat down and fann'd myself and was forced to order a glass of water O that I had the eye the basilisk is reported to have thought I and that his life were within the power of itdirectly would I kill him  He entered with an air so hateful to me but so agree∣able to every other eye that I could have look'd him dead for that too  After the general salutations he singled out Mr Hick∣man and told him He had recollected some parts of his behaviour to him when he saw him last which had made him think himself under obligation to his patience and politeness  And so indeed he was  Miss D'Oily upon his complimenting her among a knot of ladies asked him in their hearing How Miss Clarissa Harlowe did  He heard he said you were not so well as he wished you to be and as you deserved to be  O Mr Lovelace said she what have you to answer for on that young lady's account if all be true that I have heard  I have a great deal to answer for said the unblushing villain But that dear lady has so many excellencies and so much delica  y that little sins are great ones in her eye  Little sins  reply'd the lady Mr Lovelace's character is so well known that nobody believes he can commit  little  sins  You are very good to me Miss D'Oily  Indeed I am not  Then I am the only person to whom you are  not  very good And so I am the less obliged to you  He turned with an unconcerned air to Miss Playford and made her some genteel compliments I believe you know her not She visits his cousins Montague Indeed he had something in his specious manner to say to everybody And this too soon quieted the disgust each person had at his entrance  I still kept my seat and he either saw me not or would not yet see me and addressing himself to my mother taking her unwilling hand with an air of high assurance I am glad to see you here Madam I hope Miss Howe is well I have reason to complain greatly of her But hope to owe to her the highest obligations that can be laid on man  My daughter Sir is accustomed to be too warm and too zealous in her friendships for either my tranquillity or her own  There had indeed been some late occasion given for mu∣tual displeasure between my mother and me But I think she might have spared this to  him  tho' nobody heard it I believe but the person to whom it was spoken and the lady who told it to me for my mother spoke it low  We are not wholly Madam to live for ourselves said the vile hypocrite It is not everyone who has a soul capable of friendship And what a heart must that be which can be insensible to the interests of a suffering friend  This sentiment from Mr Lovelace's mouth said my mother Forgive me Sir But you can have no end surely in endeavouring to make  me  think as well of you  as some innocent creatures have thought of you to their cost  She would have flung from him But detaining her handLess severe dear Madam said he be less severe in  this  place I beseech you You will allow that a very faulty person may see his errors and when he does and owns them and repents should he not be treated merci∣fully  Your air Sir seems not to be that of a penitent But the place may as properly excuse this subject as what you call my severity  But dearest Madam permit me to say that I hope for your interest with your  charming  daughter was his syco∣phant world to have it put into my power to convince all the world that there never was a truer penitent And why why this anger dear Madam for she struggled to get her hand out of his these violent airs so  maidenly  Im∣pudent fellowMay I not ask if Miss Howe be here  She would not have been here replied my mother had she known whom she had been to see  And is she here thenThank Heaven He disen∣gaged her hand and stept forward into company  Dear Miss Lloyd said he with an air taking her hand as he quitted my mother's tell me tell me is Miss Arabella Harlowe here Or will she be here I was informed she would And this and the opportunity of paying my compliments to your friend Miss Howe were great inducements with me to attend the Colonel  Superlative assurance Was it not my dear  Miss Arabella Harlowe excuse me Sir said Miss Lloyd would be very little inclined to meet you here or anywhere else  Perhaps so my dear Miss Lloyd But perhaps for that very reason I am more desirous to see  her  Miss Harlowe Sir said Miss Biddulph with a threat∣ening air will hardly be here without her  brother  I ima∣gine if one come both will come  Heaven grant they both may said the wretch No∣thing Miss Biddulph shall  begin  from me to disturb this assemblée I assure you if they do One calm halfhour's conversation with that brother and sister would be a most  fortunate opportunity to me in presence of the Colonel and his Lady or whom else they should choose  Then turning round as if desirous to find out the one or the other or both he 'spied me and with a very low bow approached me  I was all in a flutter you may suppose He would have taken my hand I refused it all glowing with indigna∣tion Everybody's eyes upon us  I went from him to the other end of the room and sat down as I thought out of his hated sight But presently I heard his odious voice whispering behind my chair he leaning upon the back of it with impudent unconcern  Charming Miss Howe  looking over my shoulder  One request  I started up from my seat but could hardly stand neither for very indignationO this sweet but becoming disdain whisper'd on the insufferable creature I am sorry to give you all this emotion But either here or at your own house let me intreat from you one quarter of an hour's audience I beseech you Madam but one quarter of an hour in any of the adjoining apartments  Not for a kingdom fluttering my fan I knew not what I did But I could have killed him  We are so much observedElse on my knees my dear Miss Howe would I beg your interest with your charm∣ing friend  She'll have nothing to say to you  I had not then your letters my dear  Killing wordsBut indeed I have deserved them and a dagger in my heart besides I am so conscious of my demerits that I have no hope but in  your  interposition Could I owe that favour to Miss Howe's mediation which I cannot hope for on any other account  My mediation vilest of menMy mediationI ab∣hor youFrom my soul I abhor you vilest of men Three or four times I repeated these words stammering too I was excessively flutter'd  You can call me nothing Madam so bad as I will call myself I  have  been indeed the vilest of men But now I am not soPermit me Everybody's eyes upon us but one moment's audience To exchange but ten words with you dearest Miss Howein whose presence  you pleasefor your dear friend's sakebut ten words with you in the next apartment  It is an insult upon me to presume that I would ex∣change  one  with you if I could help itOut of my way and my sight fellow  And away I would have flung But he took my hand I was excessively disordered Everybody's eyes more and more intent upon us  Mr Hickman whom my mother had drawn on one side to injoin him a patience which perhaps need not to have been inforced came up just then with my mother who had him by his leadingstrings By his sleeve I should say  Mr Hickman said the bold wretch be my advocate but for ten words in the next apartment with Miss Howe in your presence and in yours Madam to my mother  Hear Nancy what he has to say to you To get rid of him hear his  ten words  Excuse me Madam His very breath Unhand me Sir  He sigh'd and look'd O how the practised villain sigh'd and look'd He then let go my hand with such a reverence in his manner as brought blame upon me from some that I would not hear him And this incensed me the more O my dear this man is a devilThis man is indeed a devilSo much patience when he pleases So much gentlenessYet so resolute so persisting so audacious  I was going out of the assemblée in great disorder He was at the door as soon as I  How kind this is said the wretch and ready to follow me open'd the door for me  I turned back upon this and not knowing what I did snapp'd my fan just in his face as he turned short upon me and the powder flew from his wig  Everybody seemed as much pleased as I was vexed  He turned to Mr Hickman nettled at the powder fly∣ing and at the smiles of the company upon him Mr Hickman you will be one of the happiest men in the world because you are a  good  man and will do nothing to provoke this passionate lady and because she has too much good sense to be provoked without reason But else the Lord have mercy upon you  This man this Mr Hickman my dear is too meek for  a man Indeed he is But my patient mother twits me that her passionate daughter ought to like him  the better  for that But meek men abroad are not always meek men at home I have observed that in more instances than one And if they  were  I should not I verily think like them the better for being so  He then turned to my mother resolved to be even with  her  too Where good Madam could Miss get all this spirit  The company round smiled for I need not tell you that my mother's highspiritedness is pretty well known and she sadly vexed said Sir you treat me as you do the rest of the worldBut  I beg pardon Madam interrupted he I might have spared my questionAnd instantly I retiring to the other end of the hall he turned to Miss Playford What would I give Miss to hear you sing that song you obliged us with at Lord M's  He then as if nothing had happened fell into a con∣versation with her and Miss D'Ollyffe upon music and whisperingly sung to Miss Playford holding her two hands with such airs of genteel unconcern that it vexed me not a little to look round and see how pleased half the giddy fools of our Sex were with him notwithstanding his no∣torious wicked character To this it is that such vile fellows owe much of their vileness whereas if they found themselves shunned and despised and treated as beasts of prey as they are they would run to their caverns there howl by themselves and none but such as sad accident or unpitiable presumption threw in their way would suffer by them  He afterwards talked very seriously at times to Mr Hickman At  times  I say for it was with such breaks and starts of gaiety turning to this lady and to that and then to Mr Hickman again resuming a serious or a gay air at pleasure that he took everybody's eye the womens especially who were full of their whispering admirations of him qualified with  If's  and  But's  and  What pity's  and such sort of stuff that shewed in their very dispraises too much liking  Well may our Sex be the sport and ridicule of such liber∣tines Unthinking eyegoverned creaturesWould not a little reflection teach us that a man of merit must be a man of modesty because a diffident one And that such a wretch as this must have taken his degrees in wickedness and gone thro' a course of vileness before he could arrive at this impenetrable effrontery An effrontery which can proceed only from the light opinion he has of us and the high one of himself  But our Sex are generally modest and bashful themselves and are too apt to consider that which in the main is their principal grace as a defect And  finely  do they judge when they think of supplying that defect by choosing a man who cannot be ashamed  His discourse to Mr Hickman turned upon you and his acknowleged injuries of you tho' he could so lightly start from the subject and return to it  I have no patience with such a devil  Man  he cannot be called To be sure he would behave in the same man∣ner anywhere or in any presence even at the altar itself if a lady were with him there  It shall ever be a rule with me that he who does not regard a woman with some degree of reverence will look upon her and occasionally  treat  her with contempt  He had the confidence to offer to take me out but I absolutely refused him and shunned him all I could put∣ting on the most contemptuous airs But nothing could mortify him  I wished twenty times I had not been there  The gentlemen were as ready as I to wish he had broken his neck rather than been present I believe For nobody was regarded but him So little of the fop yet so elegant and rich in his dress His person so specious His manner so intrepid So much meaning and penetration in his face So much gaiety yet so little of the monkey Tho' a tra∣vell'd gentleman yet no affectation no mere toupet∣man but all manly and his courage and wit the one so known the other so dreaded you must think the petitsmaîtres of which there were four or five present were most deplorably off in his company And one grave gentleman observed to me pleased to see me shun him as I did  that the poet's observation was too true That the genera∣lity of ladies were  Rakes in their hearts  or they could not be so much taken with a man who had so notorious a character  I told him The reflection both of the poet and applier was much too general and made with more illnature than good manners  When the wretch saw how industriously I avoided him shifting from one part of the hall to another he at last boldly stept up to me as my mother and Mr Hick∣man were talking to me and thus before them accosted me  I beg your pardon Madam but by your mother's leave I must have a few moments conversation with you either here or at your own house and I beg you will give me the opportunity  Nancy said my mother hear what he has to say to you In my presence you may And better in the ad∣joining apartment if it must be than to come to you at our own house  I retired to one corner of the hall my mother following me and he taking Mr Hickman under the arm follow∣ing herWell Sir said I what have you to sayTell me  here  I have been telling Mr Hickman said he how much I am concerned for the injuries I have done to the most ex∣cellent woman in the world And yet that she obtained such a glorious triumph over me the last time I had the honour to see her as with my penitence ought to have qualified her former resentments But that I will with all my soul enter into any measures to obtain her forgiveness of me My cousins Montague have told you this Lady Betty and Lady Sarah and my Lord M are engaged for my honour I know your power with the dear creature My cousins told me you gave them hopes you would use it in my behalf My Lord M and his two sisters are im∣patiently expecting the fruits of it You must have heard from her before now I hope you have And will you be so good as to tell me if I may have any hopes  If I must speak on this subject▪ Let me tell you that you have broken her heart You know not the value of  the lady you have injured You deserve her not And she despises you as she ought  Dear Miss Howe mingle not passion with denunciations so severe I must know my fate I will go abroad once more if I find her absolutely irreconcileable But I hope she will give me leave to attend upon her to know my doom from her own mouth  It would be death immediate for her to see you And what must  You  be to be able to look her in the face  I then reproached him with vehemence enough you may believe on his baseness and the evils he had made you suffer The distress he had reduced you to All your friends made your enemies The vile house he had carried you to Hinted at his villainous arts the dreadful arrest And told him of your present deplorable illness and re∣solution to die rather than have him  He vindicated not any part of his conduct but that of the arrest and so solemnly protested his sorrow for his usage of you accusing himself in the freest manner and by  deserved  appellations that I promised to lay before you this part of our conversation And now you have it  My mother as well as Mr Hickman believes from what passed on this occasion that he is touched in con∣science for the wrongs he has done you But by his whole behaviour I must own it seems to me that nothing can touch him for half an hour together Yet I have no doubt that he would willingly marry you and it piques his pride I could see that he should be denied As it did mine that such a wretch had dared to think it in his power to have such a woman whenever he pleased and that it must be accounted a condescension and matter of obliga∣tion by all his own family at least that he would vouch∣safe to think of marriage  Now my dear you have the reason before you why I suspend the decisive Negative to the ladies of his family My mother Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph who were inquisitive after the subject of our retired conversation and whose curiosity I thought it was right in some degree to gratify especially as those young ladies are of our select acquaintance are all of opinion that you should be his  You will let Mr Hickman know your whole mind  and when he acquaints me with it I will tell you all my own  Mean time may the news he will bring me of the state of your health be favourable prays with the utmost fervency  Your everfaithful and affectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER LXXV  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Thursday July    My dearest Miss  HOWE  AFTER I have thankfully acknowleged your favour in sending Mr Hickman to visit me before you set out upon your intended journey I must chide you in the sincerity of that faithful love which could not be the love it is if it would not admit of that  cementing  freedom for suspending the decisive Negative which upon such full deliberation I had intreated you to give to Mr Lovelace's relations  I am sorry that I am obliged to  repeat  to you my dear who know me so well that were I sure I should live  many years  I would not have Mr Lovelace Much less can I think of him as it is probable I may not live  one  As to the  world  and its  censures  you know my dear that however desirous I always was of a fair fame yet I never thought it right to give more than a  second place  to the world's opinion The challenges made to Mr Lovelace by Miss D'Oily in public company are a fresh proof that I have lost my reputation And what advantage would it be to me were it retrievable and were I to live long if I could not acquit myself to  myself  Having in my former said so much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends I shall say the less now But  your  hint that something else has newly passed be∣tween some of them and you gives me great concern and that as well for  my own  sake as for  theirs  since it must necessarily incense them against me I wish my dear that I had been left to my own course on an occasion so  v  ry  interesting to myself But since what is done cannot be helped I must abide the consequences Yet I dread  more than before  what may be my sister's answer if an answer be at all vouchsafed  Will you give me leave my dear to close this subject with one remarkIt is this That my beloved friend in points where her own laudable  zeal  is concerned has ever seemed more ready to fly from the  rebuke  than the  fault  If you will excuse this freedom I will acknowlege thus far in favour of your way of thinking as to the con∣duct of some parents in these nice cases That  indiscreet  op∣position does frequently as much mischief as  giddy  love  As to the invitation you are so kind as to give me to remove privately into your neighbourhood I have told Mr Hickman that I will consider of it But believe if you will be so good as to excuse me that I shall not ac∣cept of it even should I be  able  to remove I will give you my reasons for declining it and so I ought when both my love and my gratitude would make a visit nowandthen from my dear Miss Howe the most consolatory thing in the world to me  You must know then that this great town wicked as i  is wants not opportunities of being better having daily prayers at several churches in it and I am desirous as my strength will admit to embrace those opportunities The method I have proposed to myself and was beginning to practise when that cruel arrest deprived me both of free∣dom and strength is this When I was disposed to gentle exercise I took a chair to St Dunstan's church in Fleetstreet where are prayers at seven in the morning I pro∣posed if the weather favoured to walk if not to take chair to Lincoln'sInn chapel where at eleven in the morning and at five in the afternoon are the same desirable opportunities and at other times to go no farther that CoventGarden church where are early morning prayers likewise  This method pursued I doubt not will greatly help as it has already done to calm my disturbed thoughts and to bring me to that perfect resignation which I aspire af∣ter For I must own my dear that sometimes still my griefs and my reflections are too heavy for me and a  the aid I can draw from  religious duties  is hardly sufficien  to support my staggering reason I am a very young  creature you know my dear to be left to my own con∣duct in such circumstances as I am in  Another reason why I choose not to go down into your neighbourhood is The displeasure that might arise on my account between your mother and you  If indeed you were actually married and the worthy man who would then have a title to all your regard were earnestly desirous of my near neighbourhood I know not what I might do For altho' I might not perhaps intend to give up my other important reasons at the  time  I should make you a congratulatory visit yet I might not know how to de∣ny myself the pleasure of continuing near you when there  I send you inclosed the copy of my letter to my sister I hope it will be thought to be written with a true penitent spirit for indeed it is I desire that you will not think I stoop too low in it since there can be no such thing as that in a child to parents whom she has unhappily offended  But if still perhaps more disgusted than before at your freedom with them they should pass it by with the con∣tempt of silence for I have not yet been favoured with an answer I must learn to think it right in them so to do especially as it is my first direct application For I have often censured the boldness of those who applying for a favour which it is in a person's option to grant or to re∣fuse take the liberty of being offended if they are not gratified as if the  petitionedto  had not as good a right to reject as the  petitioner  to ask  But if my letter should be answered and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendyou must not my dear take upon you to cen∣sure my relations but allow for them as they know not what I have suffered as being filled with  just  resentments against me  just  to them if they  think  them just and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence  And after all what can they do for meThey can only pity me And what will that do but augment their own  grief  to which at present their  resentment  is an allevia∣tion For can they by their pity restore to me my lost re∣putation Can they by it purchase a sponge that will wipe out from the year the past fatal five months of my life  She takes in the time that she appointed to meet Mr Lovelace    Your account of the gay unconcerned behaviour of Mr Lovelace at the Colonel's does not surprise me at all af∣ter I am told that he had the intrepidity to go thither knowing who were  invited  and  expected  Only this my dear I really wonder at that Miss Howe could imagine that I could have a thought of such a man for a husband  Poor wretch I pity him to see him fluttering about abusing talents that were given him for excellent pur∣poses taking courage for wit and dancing fearless of danger on the edge of a precipice  But indeed his threatening to see me most sensibly alarms and shocks me I cannot but hope that I never never more shall see him in this world  Since you are so loth my dear to send the desired Ne∣gative to the ladies of his family I will only trouble you to transmit the letter I shall inclose for that purpose di∣rected indeed to yourself because it was to you that those ladies applied themselves on this occasion but to be sent by you to any one of the ladies at your own choice  I commend myself my dearest Miss Howe to your prayers and conclude with repeated thanks for sending Mr Hickman to me and with wishes for your health and happiness and for the speedy celebration of your nuptials  Your everaffectionate and obliged  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXVI  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Inclosed in the preceding    Thursday July    My dearest Miss  HOWE  SINCE you seem loth to acquiesce in my determined resolution signified to you as soon as I was able to hold a pen I beg the favour of you by this or by any other way you think most proper to acquaint the worthy Ladies who have applied to you in behalf of their rela∣tion that altho' I am infinitely obliged to their generous opinion of me yet I cannot consent to  sanctify  as I may say Mr Lovelace's repeated breaches of all moral sanctions and hazard my  future  happiness by an union with a man  thro' whose premeditated injuries in a long train of the basest contrivances I have forfeited my  temporal  hopes  He himself when he reflects upon his own actions must surely bear testimony to the justice as well as fitness of my determination The Ladies I dare say would were they to know the whole of my unhappy story  Be pleased to acquaint them that I deceive myself if my resolution on this head however ingratefully and even inhumanly he has treated me be not owing more to  principle  than  passion  Nor can I give a stronger proof of the truth of this assurance than by declaring that I  can  and  will  forgive him on this one easy condition  That he will never molest me more  In whatever way you choose to make this declaration be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to the Ladies of the noble family and to my Lord M accom∣pany it And do you my dear believe that I shall be to the last moment of my life  Your everobliged and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday July    I Have three letters of thine to take notice of  Letters lxxilxxiilxxiii  But am divided in my mind whether to quarrel with thee on thy unmerciful reflections or to thank thee for thy acceptable particularity and diligence But several of my sweet dears have I indeed in my time made to cry and laugh in a breath nay one side of their pretty faces laugh before the cry could go off of the other Why may I not therefore curse and applaud thee in the same moment  o take both in one And what follows as it shall rise from my pen  How often have I ingenuously confessed my sins against  is excellent creatureYet thou never sparest me altho'  bad a man as myself Since then I get so little by my  fessions I had a good mind to try to defend myself  nd that not only from antient and modern story but from  common practice and yet avoid repeating anything I have suggested before in my own behalf  I am in a humour to play the fool with my pen Briefly then from antient story firstDost thou not think that I am as much intitled to forgiveness on Miss Harlowe's account as Virgil's hero was on Queen Dido's For what an ingrateful varlet was that vagabond to the  hospitable  princess who had  willingly  conferred upon him the last favourStealing away whence I suppose the ironical phrase of  Trusty Trojan  to this day like a thief pretend∣edly indeed at the command of the gods but could that be when the errand he went upon was to rob other princes not only of their dominions but of their livesYet this fellow is at every word the  pius  Aeneas with the im∣mortal bard who celebrates him  Should Miss Harlowe even break her heart which Hea∣ven forbid for the usage she has received to say nothing of her disappointed pride to which her death would be attributable more than to reason what comparison will  her  fate hold to Queen Dido's And have I half the obli∣gation to her that Aeneas had to the Queen of Carthage The latter placing a confidence the former none in he  man Then whom  else  have I robbed Whom  else  have I injured Her brother's worthless life I gave him instead of taking any man's as the Trojan vagabond did the lives of thousands Why then should it not be the  pius  Lovelace as well as the  pius  Aeneas For do  thou think had a conflagration happened and had it bee  in my power that I would not have saved my old Anchi∣ses as he did his from the Ilion bonfire even at the ex∣pence of my Creüsa had I had a wife of that name  But for a more modern instance in my favourHave  used Miss Harlowe as our famous MaidenQueen as she was called used one of her own blood a SisterQueen▪ who threw herself into her protection from her rebelsub∣jects and whom she detained prisoner eighteen years and at last cut off her head Yet credited by worse and weake  reigns a succession four deep do not honest Protestant  pronounce  her  pious tooAnd call her particularly  th  Queen  As to  common practice  Who let me ask that has it i  his power to gratify a predominant passion be it what it will denies himself the gratificationLeaving it to cooler deliberation and if he be a great man to his flatterers to find a reason for it afterwards  Then as to the worst part of my treatment of this lady How many men are there who as well as I have sought by intoxicating liquors first to inebriate then to subdue What signifies what the  potations  were when the same end was in view  Let me tell thee upon the whole that neither the Queen of Carthage nor the Queen of Scots would have thought they had any reason to complain of cruelty had they been used no worse than I have used the Queen of my heart And then do I not aspire with my whole soul to repair by marriage Would the  pius  Aeneas thinkest thou have done such a piece of justice by Dido had she lived  Come come Belford let people run away with no∣tions as they will I am  comparatively  a very innocent man And if by these and other like reasonings I have quieted my own conscience a great end is answered What have I to do with the world  And now I sit me peaceably down to consider thy letters  I hope thy pleas in my favour  See p  when she gave thee so generously gave thee for me my letters were urged with an honest energy But I suspect thee much for be∣ing too ready to give up thy client Then thou hast such a misgiving aspect an aspect rather inviting rejection than carrying persuasion with it and art such an hesitate∣ing such an humming and hawing caitiff that I shall at∣tribute my failure if I do fail rather to the inability and ill looks of my advocate than to my cause Again Thou art deprived of the force men of our cast give to argu∣ments for she won't let thee  swear  Art moreover a very heavy thoughtless fellow tolerable only at a second rebound a horrid dunce at the  impromptu  These en∣countering with such a lady are great disadvantages And still a greater is thy balancing as thou dost at present between old Rakery and new Reformation Since this puts thee into the same situation with her as they told me at Leipsick Martin Luther was in at the first public dispute  which he held in defence of his supposed  new  doctrines with Eckius For Martin was then but a linseywolsey reformer He retained some dogma which by natural consequence made others that he held untenable So that Eckius in some points had the better of him But from that time he made clear work renouncing all that stood in his way And then his doctrines ran upon all fours He was never puzzled afterwards and could boldly declare that he would defend them in the face of angels and men and to his friends who would have dissuaded him from venturing to appear before the emperor Charles the Fifth at Spires  That were there as many devils at Spires as tiles upon the houses he would go  An answer that is admired by every Protestant Saxon to this day  Since then thy unhappy aukwardness destroys the force of thy arguments I think thou hadst better for the pre∣sent however forbear to urge her on the subject of ac∣cepting the reparation I offer lest the continual teazing of her to forgive me should but strengthen her in her denials of forgiveness till for  consistency  sake she'll be forced to adhere to a resolution so often avowed Whereas if left to herself a little time and better health which will bring on better spirits will give her quicker resentments those quicker resentments will lead her into vehemence that vehemence will subside and turn into expostulation and parley My friends will then interpose and guaranty for me And all our trouble on both sides will be over Such is the natural course of things  I cannot endure thee for thy hopelesness in the lady's recovery  See p  and that in contradiction to the Doctor and Apothecary  Time  in the words of Congreve thou sayst  will give increase to her afflictions  But why so Knowest thou not that those words so contrary to common experience were applied to the case of a person while passion was in its full vigourAt such a time everyone in a heavy grief thinks the same But as Enthusiasts do by Scripture so dost thou by the poets thou hast read Anything that carries the most distant allusion from  either  to the case in hand is put down by both for gospel however incongruous to  the general scope of either and to  that case  So once in a pulpit I heard one of the former very vehemently de∣clare himself to be a  dead dog  when every man woman and child were convinced to the contrary by his howling  I can tell thee that if nothing else will do I am deter∣mined in spite of thy buskinairs and of thy engagements for me to the contrary to see her myself  Face to face have I known many a quarrel made up which distance would have kept alive and widened Thou wilt be a madder Jack than him in the Tale of a Tub if thou givest an active opposition to this interview  In short I cannot bear the thought that a lady whom once I had bound to me in the silken cords of love should slip through my fingers and be able while  my  heart flames out with a violent passion for her to despise me and to set both love and me at defiance Thou canst not imagine how much I envy  thee  and her  Doctor  and her  Apothe∣cary  and everyone whom I hear of being admitted to her presence and conversation and wish to be the  one  or the  other  in turn  Wherefore if nothing else will do I  will  see her I'll tell thee of an admirable expedient just come cross me to save  thy  promise and  my own  Mrs Lovick you say is a good woman If the lady be worse she shall advise her to send for a parson to pray by her Unknown to her unknown to the lady unknown to  thee  for so it may pass I will contrive to be the man petticoated out and vested in a gown and cassock I once for a certain purpose did assume the canonicals and I was thought to make a fine sleek appearance my broad rosebound beaver became me  mightily  and I was much admired upon the whole by all who saw me  Methinks it must be charmingly apropos to see me kneel∣ing down by her bedside I am sure I shall pray heartily beginning out of the Commonprayer book the Sick Office for the restoration of the languishing lady and concluding with an exhortation to charity and forgiveness for myself  I will consider of this matter But in whatever shape I shall choose to appear of this thou mayst assure thy∣self I will apprise thee beforehand of my determinedupon visit that thou mayest contrive to be out of the way  and to know nothing of the matter This will save  thy  word and as to  mine  can she think worse of me than she does at present  An indispensable of true love and profound respect in thy wise opinion  See p  is absurdity or aukwardness 'Tis surprising that  thou  shouldst be one of those partial mor∣tals who take their measures of right and wrong from what they find  themselves to be  and cannot  help being  So aukwardness is a perfection in the aukwardAt this rate no man ever can be in the wrong But I insist upon it that an aukward fellow will do everything aukwardly And if he be like thee will rack his unmeaning brain for excuses as aukward as his first fault Respectful Love is an inspirer of actions worthy of itself and he who can∣not shew it where he most means it manifests that he is an unpolite rough creature a perfect Belford and has it not in him  But here thou'lt throw out that notable witticism that my outside is the best of  me  thine the worst of  thee  and that if I set about mending my mind thou wilt mend thy appearance  But pr'ythee Jack don't stay for  that  but set about thy amendment in dress when thou leavest off thy mourn∣ing for why shouldst thou prepossess in thy disfavour all those who never saw thee before It is hard to remove earlytaken prejudices whether of liking or distaste Peo∣ple will  hunt  as I may say for reasons to confirm first im∣pressions in compliment to their own sagacity Nor is it every mind that has the ingenuity to confess itself mis∣taken when it finds itself to be wrong Thou thyself art an adept in the pretended science of reading of men and whenever thou art out wilt study to find some reasons why it was more probable that thou shouldst have been right and wilt watch every motion and action and every word and sentiment in the person thou hast once censured for proofs in order to help thee to revive and maintain thy first opinion And indeed as thou seldom errest on the  favourable side  human nature is so vile a thing that thou art likely to be right five times in six on the  other  And perhaps it is but guessing of others by what thou  findest in thy own heart to have reason to compliment thyself on thy penetration  Here is preachment for thy preachment And I hope if thou likest thy own thou wilt thank me for mine the rather as thou may'st be the better for it if thou wilt Since it is calculated for thy own meridian  Well but the lady refers my destiny to the letter she has written actually written to Miss Howe to whom it seems she has given her reasons why she will not have me I long to know the contents of this letter But am in great hopes that she has so expressed her denials as shall give room to think she only wants to be persuaded to the con∣trary in order to reconcile herself to herself  I could make some pretty observations upon one or two places of the lady's meditation But wicked as I am thought to be I never was so abandoned as to turn into ridicule or even to treat with levity things sacred I think it the highest degree of ill manners to jest upon those subjects which the world in general look upon with veneration and call divine I would not even treat the mythology of the Heathen to a Heathen with the ridicule that perhaps would fairly lie from some of the absurdities that strike every common observer Nor when at Rome and in other popish countries did I ever behave shockingly at those ceremonies which I thought very extraordinary For I saw some people affected and seemingly edified by them and I contented myself to think tho' they were be∣yond my comprehension that if they answered any good end to the  many  there was religion enough in them or civil policy at least to exempt them from the ridicule of even a  bad  man who had common sense and good manners  For the like reason I have never given noisy or tumul∣tuous instances of dislike to a new Play if I thought it ever so indifferent For I concluded first that every one was intitled to see quietly what he paid for And next as the Theatre the epitome of the world consisted of Pit Boxes and Gallery it was hard I thought if there could be such a performance exhibited as would not please some∣body in that mixed multitude And if it did those some∣bodies  had as much right to enjoy their own judgments un∣disturbedly as I had to enjoy mine  This was  my  way of shewing my disapprobation I ne∣ver went again And as a man is at his option whether he will go to a Play or not he has not the same excuse for expressing his dislike clamorously as if he were  compelled  to see it  I have ever thou knowest declared against those shal∣low libertines who could not make out their pretensions to wit but on two subjects to which every man of  tr  wit will scorn to be beholden PROFANENESS and OBSCE∣NITY I mean which must shock the ears of every man or woman of sense without answering any end but of shewing a very low and abandoned nature And till I came acquainted with the brutal Mowbray no great praise to myself from such a tutor I was far from making so free as I now do with oaths and curses for then I was forced to outswear him sometimes to keep him in his al∣legiance to me his general Nay I often check myself to myself for this empty unprofitable liberty of speech in which we are outdone by the sons of the common sewer▪  All my vice is women and the love of plots and in∣trigues and I cannot but wonder how I fell into those shocking freedoms of speech since generallyspeaking they are far from helping forward my main end Only nowandthen indeed a little novice rises to one's notice who seems to think dress and oaths and curses the diagno∣stics of the rakish spirit she is inclined to favour And in∣deed they are the only qualifications that some who are called Rakes and Pretty fellows have to boast of But what must the women be who can be attracted by such  emptysoul'd  profligates Since wickedness  with  wit is hardly excusable but  without  it is equally shocking and contemptible  There again is preachment for thy preachment and thou wilt be apt to think that I am reforming too But no such matter If this were  new light  darting in upon me as thy morality seems to be to thee something of this kind might be apprehended But this was  always  my way of thinking and I defy thee or any of thy brethren to name a time when I have either ridiculed Religion or  talked obscenely On the contrary thou knowest how often I have checked that Bear in lovematters Mowbray and the finical Tourville and thyself too for what ye have called the doubleentendre In  love  as in points that required a  manly resentment  it has always been my maxim to  act  rather than  talk  and I do assure thee as to the first the ladies themselves will excuse the one sooner than the other  As to the admiration thou expressest for the books of Scripture thou art certainly right in it But 'tis strange to me that thou wert ignorant of their beauty and noble simplicity till now Their antiquity always made me reverence them And how was it possible that thou couldst not for that reason if for no other give them a perusal  I'll tell thee a short story which I had from my tutor admonishing me against exposing myself by  ignorant won∣der  when I should quit college go to town or travel  The first time Dryden's Alexander's Feast fell into his hands he told me he was prodigiously charmed with it And having never heard anybody speak of it before thought as thou dost of the Bible that he had made a new discovery  He hastened to an appointment which he had with se∣veral wits for he was then in town one of whom was a noted Critic who according to him had more merit than good fortune for all the little nibblers in wit whose writings would not stand the test of criticism made it he said a common cause to run him down as men would a mad dog  The young gentleman for young he then was set forth magnificently in the praises of that inimitable per∣formance and gave himself airs of secondhand merit for finding out its beauties  The old Bard heard him out with a smile which the collegian took for approbation till he spoke and then it was in these mortifying words 'Sdeath Sir where have you lived till now or with what sort of company have you conversed young as you are that you have never before heard of the finest piece in the English lan∣guage  This story had such an effect upon  me  who had ever a  proud heart and wanted to be thought a clever fellow that in order to avoid the like disgrace I laid down two rules to myself The first whenever I went into company where there were strangers to hear everyone of them speak before I gave myself liberty to prate The other if I found any of them above my match to give up all title to new discoveries contenting myself to praise what they praised as beauties familiar to me tho' I had never heard of them before And so by degrees I got the reputa∣tion of a wit myself And when I threw off all restraint and books and learned conversation and fell in with some of our brethren who are now wandering in Erebus and with such others as Belton Mowbray Tourville and thy∣self I set up on my own stock and like what we have been told of Sir Richard in his latter days valued myself on being the emperor of the company for having fa∣thomed the depth of them all and afraid of no rival but thee whom also I had got a little under by my gaiety and promptitude at least I proudly like Addison's Cato delighted to give laws to my little senate  Proceed with thee byandby  LETTER LXXVIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  BUT now I have cleared myself of any intentional le∣vity on occasion of my beloved's meditation which as thou observest is finely suited to her case that is to say as she and you have drawn her case I cannot help ex∣pressing my pleasure that by one or two verses of it the  arrow  Jack and  what she feared being come upon her  I am encouraged to hope what it will be very surprising to me if it do not happen That is in plain English that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma  This cursed arrest because of the ill effects the terror might have had upon her in that hopedfor circumstance has concerned me more than on any other account It would be the pride of my life to prove in this charming frostpiece the triumph of nature over principle and to have a young Love  ace by such an angel And then for its sake I am confident she will live and will legitimate it And what  a meritorious little cherub would it be that should lay an obligation upon both parents before it was born which nei∣ther of them would be able to repayCould I be sure it is so I should be out of all pain for her recovery  Pain  I say since were she to  dieDie  abominable word how I hate it I verily think I should be the most miser∣able man in the world  As for the earnestness she expresses for death she has found the words ready to her hand in honest Job else she would not have delivered herself with such strength and vehemence  Her innate piety as I have more than once observed will not permit her to shorten her own life either by violence or neglect She has a mind too noble for that and would have done it before now had she designed any such thing For to do it like the Roman matron when the mischief is over and it can serve no end and when the man how∣ever a Tarquin as some may think him in this action is not a Tarquin in power so that no national point can be made of it is what she has too much good sense to think of  Then as I observed in a like case a little while ago the distress when this was written was strong upon her and she saw no end of it But all was darkness and apprehension before her Moreover has she it not in her power to  disappoint  as much as she has been  disap∣pointed  Revenge Jack has induced many a woman to cherish a life which grief and despair would otherwise have put an end to  And after all death is no such eligible thing as Job in his  calamities  makes it And a death desired merely from worldly disappointment shews not a right mind let me tell this lady whatever she may think of it  Mr Lovelace could not know that the lady was  so  thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine as she really was For in letter lxix to Mrs Norton p of this volume she says  Nor let it be imagined that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy for altho' it was brought on by disappointment the world shewing me early even at my first  rushing  into it its true and ugly face yet I hope that it has obtain  d a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has  You  and I Jack altho' not afraid in the height of passion or resentment to rush into those dangers which might be followed by a sudden and violent death whenever a point of honour calls upon us would shudder at his cool and deliberate approach in a lingering sickness which had de∣bilitated the spirits  So we read of a French general in the reign of Harry the IVth I forget his name if it were not Mareschal Bi∣ron who having faced with intrepidity the ghastly varlet on an hundred occasions in the field was the most dejected of wretches when having forfeited his life for treason he was led with all the cruel parade of preparation and surrounding guards to the scaffold  The poet says well  'Tis not the Stoic lesson got by rote  The pomp of words and pedant dissertation  That can support us in the hour of terror  Books have taught cowards to talk nobly of it  But when the  trial  comes they start and stand oghast  Very true For then it is the old man in the fable with his bundle of sticks  The lady is well read in Shakespeare our English pride and glory and must sometimes reason with herself in his words so greatly expressed that the subject affecting as it is cannot produce any thing more so  Ay but to di  and go we know not where  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot  This  sensible warm motion to become  A kneaded cl  d and the delighted spirit  To bathe in fiery floods or to reside  In thrilling regions of thickribbed ice  To be imprison'd in the viewless winds  Or blown with restless violence about  The pendent worlds or to be worse than worst  Of those that lawless and uncertain thought  Imagines howling 'Tis too horrible  The weariest and most loaded worldly life  That pain age penury and  imprisonment  Can lay on nature is a paradise  To what we fear of death  I find by one of thy three letters that my beloved had some account from Hickman of my interview with Miss Howe at Col Ambrose's I had a very agreeable time of it there altho' severely raillied by several of the assem∣blée It concerns me however not a little to find our affair so generally known among the  Flippanti  of both sexes It is all her own fault There never surely was such an odd little soul as this Not to keep her own secret when the revealing of it could answer no possible good end and when she wants not one would think to raise to herself either pity or friends or to me enemies by the procla∣mation Why Jack must not all her own sex laugh in their sleeves at her weakness What would become of the peace of the world if all women should take it into their heads to follow her example What a fine time of it would the heads of families have Their wives always filling their ears with their confessions their daughters with theirs Sisters would be every day setting their bro∣thers about cutting of throats if they had at heart  the ho∣nour of their families  as it is called and the whole world would either be a scene of confusion or cuckoldom must be as much the fashion as it is in Lithuania  In Lithuania the women are said to have  so allowedly  their gal∣lants called  adjutores  that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any party of pleasure without them    I am glad however that Miss Howe as much as she hates me kept her word with my cousins on their visit to her and with me at the Colonel's to endeavour to per∣suade her friend to make up all matters by matrimony which no doubt is the best nay the  only  method she can take for her own honour and that of her family  I had once thoughts of revenging myself on that little vixen and particularly as thou mayst  This plot of his is mentioned Vol iv p  remember had planned something to this purpose on the journey she is going to take which had been talked of some time But I thinkLet me seeYes I  think  I will let this Hick∣man have her safe and intire as thou believest the fellow to be a tolerable sort of a mortal and that I had made the worst of him And I am glad for his own sake he has not launched out too virulently against me to thee  And thus if I pay thee not in quality I do in quan∣tity and yet leave a multitude of things unobserved upon For I begin not to know what to do with myself here Tired with Lord M who in his recovery has play'd upon me the fable of the nurse the crying child and the wolf Tired with my cousins Montague tho' charming girls were they not so near of kinTired with Mowbray and Tourville and their everlasting identityTired with the countryTired of myself Longing for what I have not I must go to town and there have an interview with the charmer of my soul For desperate diseases must have de∣sperate remedies and I only wait to know my doom from Miss Howe and then if it be rejection I will try my fate and receive my sentence at her feet But I will apprise thee of it beforehand as I told thee that thou mayst keep thy parole with the lady in the best manner thou canst  LETTER LXXIX  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  In answer to hers of July    p    Friday night July    I Will now my dearest friend write to you all my mind without reserve on your resolution not to have this vilest of men You gave me in yours of Sunday the d reasons so worthy of the pure mind of my Clarissa Harlowe in support of this your resolution that nothing but selflove lest I should lose my everamiable friend could have prevailed upon me to wish you to alter it  Indeed I thought it was impossible there could be how∣ever desirable so noble an instance given by any of our Sex of a passion conquered when there were so many in∣ducements to give way to it And therefore I was will∣ing to urge you once more to overcome your just indigna∣tion and to be prevailed upon by the solicitations of  his  friends before you carried your resentments to so great a height that it would be more difficult for you and less to your honour to comply than if you had complied at first  But now my dear that I see you fixed in your noble resolution and that it is impossible for your pure mind to  join itself with that of so perjured a miscreant I congra∣tulate you most heartily upon it and beg your pardon for but seeming to doubt that  Theory  and  Practice  were not the same thing with my beloved Clarissa Harlowe  I have only one thing that saddens my heart on this oc∣casion and that is the bad state of health Mr Hickman unwillingly owns you are in For altho' you so well ob∣serve the doctrine you always laid down to me That a censured person should first seek to be justified to herself and give but a second place to the world's opinion of her and in all cases where the two could not be reconciled to prefer the first to the last and tho' you  are  so well justified to your Anna Howe and to your own heart yet my dear let me beseech you to endeavour to recover your health and spirits by all possible means And this as what if it  can  be effected will crown the work and shew the world that you were  indeed  got above the base wretch and tho' put out of your course for a little while could resume it again and go on blessing all within your know∣lege as well by your example as by your precepts  For Heaven's sake then for the world's sake for the honour of our sex and for  my  sake once more I beseech you try to overcome this shock And if you  can  over∣come it I shall then be as happy as I wish to be for I cannot indeed I cannot think of parting with you for many many years to come  The reasons you give for discouraging my wishes to have you near us are so convincing that I ought at pre∣sent to acquiesce in them But my dear when your mind is fully settled as now you are so absolutely determined in it with regard to this wretch I hope it will soon be I shall expect you with us or near us And then you shall chalk out every path that I will set my foot in nor will I turn aside either to the right hand or to the left  You wish I had not mediated for you to your friends I wish so too because it was ineffectual because it may give new ground for the malice of some of them to work upon and because you are angry with me for doing so But how as I said in my former could I sit down quietly knowing how uneasy their implacableness must make you But I will tear myself from the subjectfor I see I shall  be warm againand displease youAnd there is not one thing in the world that I would do however agreeable to myself if I thought it would disoblige you nor any one that I would omit to do if I knew it would give you pleasure And indeed my dear halfsevere friend I will try if I cannot avoid the  fault  as willingly as I would the  rebuke  For this reason I forbear saying anything on so nice a subject as your letter to your sister It  must  be right be∣cause you think it soand if it be taken as it ought that will shew you that it  is  But if it beget insults and re∣vilings as it is but too likely I find you don't intend to let me know it  You were always so ready to accuse yourself for other peoples faults and to suspect your own conduct rather than the judgment of your relations that I have often told you I cannot imitate you in this It is not a necessary point of belief with me that all people in  years  are  there∣fore  wise or that all  young people  are  therefore  rash and headstrong It may be  generally  the case as far as I know And possibly it may be so in the case of  my  mother and  her  girl But I will venture to say that it has not yet ap∣peared to be so between the principals of HarlowePlace and their second daughter  You are for excusing them beforehand for their expect∣ed cruelty as not knowing what you have suffered nor how ill you are They have  heard  of the former and are not sorry for it Of the latter they have been  told  and  I  have most reason to know how they have taken itBut I shall be far from avoiding the  fault  and as surely shall incur the  rebuke  if I say any more upon this subject I will therefore only add at present That your reasonings in their behalf shew  you  to be all excellence their returns to you that  they  are allDo my dear let me end with a little bit of spiteful justiceBut you won't I knowSo I have done quite done however reluctantly Yet if you think of the word I would have said don't doubt the justice of it and fill up the blank with it  You put me in hope that were I actually married and Mr Hickman to  desire  it you would think of obliging me with a visit on the occasion and that perhaps when  with me it would be difficult for you to remove far from me  Lord my dear what a stress do you seem to lay upon Mr Hickman's  desiring  it To be sure he does and would of all things desire to have you  near  us and  with  us if we might be so favoured Policy as well as veneration for  you  would undoubtedly make the man if not a fool  desire  this But let me tell you that if Mr Hickman after marriage should pretend to dispute with me my friendships as I hope I am not quite a fool I should let him know how far his own quiet was concerned in such an impertinence especially if they were such friendships as were contracted before I knew him  I know I always differed from you on this subject for you think more highly of a  husband  's prerogative than most people do of the  royal  oneThese notions my dear from a person of your sense and judgment are noway advantageous to us inasmuch as they justify that insolent Sex in their assumptions when hardly one out of ten of them their opportunities considered deserve any prero∣gative at all Look thro' all the families we know and we shall not find onethird of them have half the sense of their wives And yet these are to be vested with prero∣gativesAnd a woman of twice their sense has nothing to do but hear tremble and obeyAnd for  conscience  sake too I warrant  But Mr Hickman and I may perhaps have a little dis∣course upon these sort of subjects before I suffer him to talk of the day And then I shall let him know what he has to trust to as he will me if he be a sincere man what he pretends to expect from me But let me tell you my dear that it is more in  your  power than perhaps you think it to hasten the day so much pressedfor by my mother as well as wish'dfor by youFor the very day that you can assure me that you are in a tolerable state of health and have discharged your Doctor and Apothecary at their own motions on that accountSome day in a month from that desirable news shall be itSo my dear make haste and be well and then this matter will be brought to ef∣fect in a manner more agreeable to your Anne Howe than it otherwise ever can  I send this day by a particular hand to the Misses Montague your letter of just reprobation of the greatest profligate in the kingdom and hope I shall not have done amiss that I transcribe some of the paragraphs of your letter of the d and send them with it as you at first intended should be done  You are it seems and that too much for your health employed in writing I hope it is in penning down the particulars of your tragical story And my mother has put me in mind to press you to it with a view that one day if it might be published under feigned names it would be of as much use as honour to the Sex My mo∣ther says she cannot help admiring you for the propriety of your resentment in your refusal of the wretch and she would be extremely glad to have her advice of pen∣ning your sad story complied with And then she says your noble conduct throughout your trials and calamities will afford not only a shining Example to your Sex but at the same time those calamities befalling SUCH a person a fearful Warning to the inconsiderate young creatures of it  On Monday we shall set out on our journey and I hope to be back in a fortnight and on my return will have one pull more with my mother for a London journey And if the  pretence must  be the buying of cloaths the  principal motive  will be that of seeing once more my dear friend  while  I can say I have not finally given consent to the change of a visitor into a relation and so can call myself MY OWN as well as  YOUR ANNA HOWE  LETTER LXXX  Miss  HOWE  To the two Misses  MONTAGUE  Sat July    Dear Ladies  I Have not been wanting to use all my interest with my beloved friend to induce her to forgive and be recon∣ciled to your kinsman tho' he has so ill deserved it and have even  repeated  my earnest advice to her on this head This repetition and the waiting for her answer having taken up time have been the cause that I could  not sooner do myself the honour of writing to you on this subject  You will see by the inclosed her immoveable resolu∣tion grounded on noble and highsoul'd motives which I cannot but  regret  and  applaud  at the same time  Applaud  for the justice of her determination which will confirm all your worthy house in the opinion you had conceived of her unequalled merit and  regret  because I have but too much reason to apprehend as well by that as by the report of a gentleman just come from her that she is in such a declining way as to her health that her thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here  The inclosed letter she thought fit to send to me unsealed that after I had perused it I might forward it to you And this is the reason it is superscribed by myself and sealed with my seal It is very full and peremptory but as she had been pleased in a letter to me dated the d instant as soon as she could hold a pen to give me ampler reasons why she could not comply with your pressing re∣quests as well as mine I will transcribe some of the pas∣sages in that letter which will give one of the wickedest men in the world if he sees them reason to think himself one of the unhappiest in the loss of so incomparable a wife as he might have gloried in had he not been so  superlatively  wicked These are the passages  Sec for these passages Miss Harlowe's letter N  o    lxvi  dated July    marked with turn'd comma's thus"  And now ladies you have before you my beloved friend's reasons for her refusal of a man unworthy of the relation he bears to so many excellent persons And I will add for I cannot help it that the merit and rank of the person considered and the vile manner of his proceedings there never was a greater villainy committed And since she thinks her first and  only  fault cannot be expiated but by death I pray to God  daily  and will  hourly  from the moment I shall hear of that sad catastrophe that He will be pleased to make him the subject of his vengeance in some such way as that all who know of his perfidious crime may see the hand of Heaven in the punishment of it  You will forgive me ladies I love not my own soul  better than I do Miss Clarissa Harlowe And the distresses she has gone thro' and the persecutions she suffers from all her friends the curse she lies under for his sake from her implacable father her reduced health and circum∣stances from high health and affluence and that execrable arrest and confinement which have deepened all her other calamities and which must be laid at his door as the action of his vile agents that whether from his immediate orders or not naturally flowed from his preceding base∣ness the Sex dishonoured in the eye of the world in the person of one of the greatest ornaments of it his unmanly methods whatever they were for I know not all as yet of compassing her ruin all join to justify my warmth and my execrations against a man whom I think ex∣cluded by his crimes from the benefit even of christian forgivenessAnd were you to see all she writes and the admirable talents she is mistress of you yourselves would join to admire her and execrate him as I do  Believe me to be with a high sense of your merits  Dear Ladies  Your most obedient humble Servant  ANNA HOWE  LETTER LXXXI  Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Friday July    My dearest young Lady  I Have the consolation to tell you that my son is once again in an hopeful way as to his health He desires his duty to you He is very low and weak And so am I But this is the first time that I have been able for se∣veral days past to sit up to write or I would not have been so long silent  Your letter to your sister is received and answered You have the answer by this time I suppose I wish it may be to your satisfaction But am afraid it will not For by Betty Barnes I find they were in a great ferment on receiving yours and much divided whether it should be answered or not They will not yet believe that you are so ill as to my infinite concern I find you are What passed be∣tween  Miss Harlowe and Miss Howe as I feared has been an aggravation  I shewed Betty two or three passages in your letter to me and she seemed moved and said She would report them favourably and would procure me a visit from Miss Harlowe if I would promise to shew the same to  her  But I have heard no more of that  Methinks I am sorry you refuse the wicked man But doubt not nevertheless that your motives for doing so are righter than my wishes that you would not But as you would be resolved as I may say on life if you gave way to such a thought and as I have so much interest in it I cannot forbear shewing this regard to myself as to ask you Cannot you my dear young lady get over your just resentments But I dare say no more on this subject  What a dreadful thing indeed was it for my dearest tender young lady to be arrested in the streets of London How does my heart go over again for you what yours must have suffered at that timeYet this to such a mind as yours must be light compared to what you had suf∣fered before  O my dearest Miss Clary how shall we know what to pray for when we pray for any thing but that  God's wil  may be done  and that we may be  resigned to it  When at nine years old and afterwards at eleven you had a dan∣gerous fever how incessantly did we all grieve and pray and put up our vows to the throne of grace for your re∣covery For all our lives were bound up in your life Yet  now  my dear as it has proved especially if we are  soon  to lose you what a much more desirable event both for you and for us had we  then  lost you  A sad thing to say But as it is in pure love to you that I say it and in full conviction that we are not always fit to be our own choosers I hope it may be excuseable and the rather as the same reflection will naturally lead both you and me to acquiesce under the present dispensation since we are assured that nothing happens by chance and that the greatest good may for aught we know be produced from the heaviest evils  I am glad you are with such honest people and that  you have all your effects restoredHow dreadfully have you been used that one should be glad of such a poor piece of justice as that  Your talent at moving the passions is always hinted at and this Betty of your sister's never comes near me that she is not full of it But as you say whom has it moved that you  wished  to move Yet were it not for this un∣happy notion I am sure your mamma would relent For∣give me my dear Miss Clary for I must try one way to be convinced if my opinion be not just But I will not tell you what that is unless it succeeds I will try in pure duty and love to  them  as well as to  you  May Heaven be your support in all your trials is the constant prayer my dearest young lady of  Your everaffectionate Friend and Servant  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER LXXXII  Mrs  NORTON  To Mrs  HARLOWE  Friday July    Honoured Madam  BEING forbidden without leave to send you anything I might happen to receive from my beloved Miss Clary and so ill that I cannot attend to  ask  your leave I give you this trouble to let you know that I have received a letter from her which I think I should hereafter be held inexcuseable as things may happen if I did not desire permission to communicate it to you and that as soon as possible  Applications have been made to the dear young lady from Lord M from the two ladi  his sisters and from both his nieces and from the wicked man himself to for∣give and marry him This in noble indignation for the usage she has received from him she has absolutely refused And perhaps Madam if you and the honoured family should be of opinion that to comply with their wishes is  now  the properest measure that  can  be taken the circum∣stances of things may require your authority or advice either to induce her to change her mind or to confirm her in it  I have reason to believe that one motive for her refusal is her full conviction that she shall not long be a trouble to  anybody and so she would not give a husband a right to interfere with her family in relation to the estate her grand∣father bequeathed to her But of this however I have not the least intimation from her Nor would she I dare say mention it  as  a reason having still stronger to refuse him from his vile treatment of her  The letter I have received will shew how truly penitent the dear creature is and if I have your permission I will send it sealed up with a copy of mine to which it is an answer But as I resolve upon this step without her know∣lege and indeed I do I will not acquaint her with it unless it be attended with desirable effects Because other∣wise besides making me incur her displeasure it might quite break her already halfbroken heart  I am honoured Madam  Your dutiful and everobliged Servant  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER LXXXIII  Mrs  HARLOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON  Sunday July    WE all know your virtuous prudence worthy woman we all do But your partiality to this your rash favourite is likewise known And we are no less ac∣quainted with the unhappy body's power of painting her distresses so as to pierce a stone  Everyone is of opinion that the dear naughty crea∣ture is working about to be forgiven and received and for this reason it is that Betty has been forbidden Not by me you may be sure to mention any more of her letters for she did speak to my Bella of some moving passages you read to her  This will convince you that nothing will be heard in her favour To what purpose then should I mention any thing about herBut you may be sure that I  will  if I can have but one second However that is not at all likely until we see what the  cons  quences  of her crime will be And who can tell thatShe mayHow can I speak it and my once darling daughter unmarriedShe may be with childThis would perpetuate her stain Her bro∣ther  may come to some harm which God forbidOne child's ruin I hope will not be followed by another's murder  As to her grief and her present misery whatever it be she must bear with it and it must be short of what I hourly bear for her Indeed I am afraid nothing but her being at the last extremity of all will make her father and her uncles and her other friends forgive her  The easy pardon perverse children meet with when they have done the rashest and most rebellious thing they can do is the reason  as is pleaded to us every day  that so  many  follow their example They depend upon the in∣dulgent weakness of their parents tempers and in  that  dependence harden their own hearts And a little humi∣liation when they have brought themselves into the fore∣told misery is to be a sufficient atonement for the greatest perverseness  But for such a child as this  I mention what others hourly say but what I must sorrowfully subscribe to  to lay plots and stratagems to deceive her parents as well as herself and to run away with a libertine Can there be any atone∣ment for her crime And is she not answerable to God to us to you and to all the world who knew her for the abuse of such talents as  she  has abused  You say her heart is halfbroken Is it to be wondered at Was not her sin committed equally against warning and the light of her own knowlege  That  he  would now marry her or that  she  would refuse him if she believed him in earnest as she has circumstanced herself is not at all probable and were  I  inclined to be∣lieve it  nobody else  here would He values not his rela∣tions and would deceive them as soon as any others His aversion to marriage he has always openly declared and still occasionally declares it But if he be now in earnest which every one who knows him must doubt Which do you think hating us too as he professes to hate and despise us all would be soonest to be chosen here To hear of her death or of her marriage with such a vile man  To all of us yet I cannot say For Oh my good Mrs Norton you know what a mother's tenderness for the  child of her heart would make her choose notwithstand∣ing all that child's faults rather than lose her for ever  But I must sail with the tide my own judgment also joining with it or I should make the unhappiness of the more worthy still greater my dear Mr Harlowe's parti∣cularly which is already more than enough to make them unhappy for the remainder of their days This I know If I were to oppose the rest our son would fly out to find this libertine and who could tell what would be the issue of that with such a man of violence and blood as that Lovelace is known to be  All I can expect to prevail for her is that in a week or so Mr Brand may be sent up to inquire privately about her present state and way of life and to see she is not altogether destitute For nothing she writes herself will be regarded  Her father indeed has at her earnest request withdrawn the curse which in a passion he laid upon her at her first wicked flight from us But Miss Howe It is a sad thing Mrs Norton to suffer so many ways at once had made matters so difficult by her undue liberties with us all as well by speech in all companies as by letters written to my Bella that we could hardly prevail upon him to hear her letter read  These liberties of Miss Howe with us the general cry against us abroad whereever we are spoken of and the  visible  and not seldom  audible  disrespectfulness which high and low treat us with to our faces as we go to and from church and even  at  church for nowhere else have we the heart to go as if none of us had been regarded but upon her account and as if she were innocent we all in fault are constant aggravations you must needs think to the whole family  She has made my lot heavy I am sure that was far from being light beforeI am injoined to tell you truth not to receive any thing of hers from any hand without leave Should I therefore gratify my yearnings after her so far as to receive privately the letter you mention what would the case be but to torment myself without being able to do her goodAnd were it to be knownMr Harlowe is  so  passionateAnd should it throw his gout  into his stomach as her rash flight didIndeed indeed I am very unhappyFor Oh my good woman she is my child stillBut unless it were more in my power Yet do I long to see the letterYou say it tells of her pre∣sent way and circumstancesThe poor child who ought to be in possession of thousandsAnd  will  For her father will be a faithful steward for herBut it must be in his own way and at his own time  And is she  really  illso  very  ill But she  ought  to sorrowShe has given a double measure of it  But does she  really  believe she shall not  long  trouble us But Oh my NortonShe must she  will  long trouble usFor can she think her death if we should be deprived of her will put an end to our afflictions Can it be thought that the fall of such a child will not be regretted by us to the last hour of our lives  But in the letter you have does she without  reserve  express her contrition Has she in it no reflecting hints Does she not aim at extenuationsIf I  were  to see it will it not shock me so much that my  apparent  grief may expose me to harshnessesCan it be contrived  But to what purposeDon't send itI charge you don'tI dare not see it  Yet  But alas  O forgive the distractedthoughted mother You  can  You know how to allow for all this So I will let it goI will not write over again this part of my letter  But I choose not to know more of her than is commu∣nicated to us allNo more than I dare  own  I have seen And what some of them may rather communicate  to  me than receive  from  me And this for the sake of my out∣ward quiet Altho' my inward peace suffers more and more by the compelled reserve  I was forced to break off But I will now try to con∣clude my long letter  I am sorry you are ill But if you were well I could not for your own sake wish you to go up as Betty tells us you long to do If you  went  nothing would be minded that came from you As they already think you too par∣tial  in her favour your going up would confirm it and do yourself prejudice and her no good And as everybody values you here I advise you not to interest yourself too warmly in her favour especially before my Bella's Betty till I can let you know a  proper  time Yet to forbid you to love the dear naughty creature who can O my Norton you  must  love herAnd so must I  I send you five guineas to help you in your present ill∣ness and your son's for it must have lain heavy upon you What a sad sad thing my dear good woman that all  your  pains and all  my  pains for eighteen or nineteen years together have in so few months been rendered thus deplorably vain Yet I must be always your friend and pity you for the very reason that I myself deserve every one's pity  Perhaps I may find an opportunity to pay you a visit as in your illness and then may weep over the letter you mention with you But for the future write nothing to me about the poor girl that you think may not be com∣municated to us all  And I charge you as you value my friendship as you wish my peace not to say anything of a letter you have from me either to the naughtyone or to anybody else I was some little relief the occasion given to write to you who must in so particular a manner share my af∣fliction A mother Mrs Norton cannot forget her child tho' that child could abandon her mother and in so doing run away with all her mother's comfortsAs I can truly say is the case of  Your unhappy Friend  CHARLOTTE HARLOWE  LETTER LXXXIV  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON  Sat July    I Congratulate you my dear Mrs Norton with all my heart on your son's recovery which I pray to God with your own health to perfect  I write in some hurry being apprehensive of the con∣sequence of the hints you give of some method you pro∣pose  to try in my favour With my relations I presume you mean But you will not tell me what you say if it prove unsuccessful  Now I must beg of you that you will not take any step in my favour with which you do not first acquaint me  I have but one request to make to them besides what is contained in my letter to my sister and I would not me∣thinks for their own future peace of mind's sake that they should be teazed so by your wellmeant kindness and Miss Howe's as to be put upon denying me that And why should more be asked for me than I can partake of More than is absolutely necessary for my own peace  You suppose I should have my sister's answer to my letter by the time yours reached my hand I have it and a severe one a very severe one it is Yet considering my fault in their eyes and the provocations I am to suppose they so newly had from my dear Miss Howe I am to look upon it as a favour that it was answered at all I will send you a copy of it soon as also of mine to which it is an answer  I have reason to be very thankful that my father has withdrawn that heavy malediction which affected me so muchA parent's curse my dear Mrs Norton what child could die in peace under a parent's curse so literally fulfilled too as this has been in what relates to this life  My heart is too full to touch upon the particulars of my sister's letter I can make but  one  atonement for my fault May  that  be accepted And may it soon be for∣gotten by  every  dear relation that there was such an un∣happy daughter sister or niece as Clarissa Harlowe  My cousin Morden was one of those who was so earned in prayers for my recovery at nine and eleven years of age as you mention My sister thinks he will be one of those who will wish I never had a being But pray when he does come let me hear of it with the first  You think that were it not for that unhappy notion of my moving talent my mamma would relent What would I give to see her once more and altho' unknown to her to kiss but the hem of her garment  Could I have thought that the last time I saw her would  have been the last  with what difficulty should I have been  torn from her embraced feet And when skreen'd be∣hind the yewhedge on the th of April last  Vol  ii  p    I saw my father and my uncle Antony and my brother and sister how little did I think that That would be the last time I should ever see them and in so short a space that so many dreadful evils would befal me  But I can write nothing but what must give you trouble I will therefore after repeating my desire that you will not intercede for me but with my previous consent con∣clude with the assurance that I am and ever will be  Your most affecionate and dutiful  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXXV  Miss  AR HARLOWE  To Miss  CL HARLOWE  In answer to hers of Friday July    p      Thursday July    O my unhappy lost Sister  WHAT a miserable hand have you made of your romantic and giddy expedition I pity you at my heart  You may  well  grieve and repentLovelace has left youIn what way or circumstances you know best  I wish your conduct had made your case more pitiable But 'tis your own seeking  God help you For you have not a friend will look upon youPoor wicked undone creatureFallen as you are against warning against expostulation against duty  But it signifies nothing to reproach you I weep over you  My poor mammaYour rashness and folly have made  her  more miserable than  you  can be Yet she has besought my papa to grant your request  My uncles joined with her for they thought there was a little more modesty in your letter than in those of your pert advocate And he is pleased to give me leave to write but only these words for  him  and no more  That he withdraws the curse he laid upon you at the first hearing of your wicked flight so far as it is in his  power to do it and hopes that your present punishment may be all you will meet with For the rest He will never own you nor forgive you and grieves he has such a daughter in the world  All this and more you have deserved from him and from all of  Us  But what have you done to this aban∣doned libertine to deserve what you have met with at  his  handsI fear I fear sisterBut no moreA blessed four months work have you made of it  My brother is now at Edinburgh sent thither by my father tho' he knows not this to be the motive that he may not meet this triumphant deluder  We are told he would be glad to marry you But why then did he abandon you He had kept you till he was tired of you no question and it is not likely he would wish to have you but upon the terms you have already without all doubt been  his  You ought to advise your friend Miss Howe to concern herself less in your matters than she does except she could do it with more decency She has written three letters to me Very insolent ones Your favourer poor Mrs Nor∣ton thinks you know nothing of the pert creature's write∣ing I hope you don't But then the more impertinent the writer But believing the fond woman I sat down the more readily to answer your letter and write with less severity than otherwise I should have done if I had an∣swered it at all  Monday last was your Birthday Think poor ingrate∣ful wretch as you are how we all used to keep it and you will not wonder to be told that we ran away from one another that day But God give you true penitence if you have it not already And it  will  be true if it be equal to the shame and the sorrow you have given us all  Your afflicted Sister  ARABELLA HARLOWE  Your cousin Morden is every day expected in England He as well as others of the family when he comes to hear what a blessed piece of work you have made of it will wish you never had a being  LETTER LXXXVI  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Sunday July    YOU have given me great pleasure my dearest friend by your approbation of my reasonings and of my resolution founded upon them never to have Mr Love∣lace This approbation is so  right  a thing give me leave to say from the nature of the case and from the strict honour and true dignity of mind which I always admired in my Anna Howe that I could hardly tell to what but to my evil destiny that of late would not let me please any∣body to attribute the advice you gave me to the contrary  But let not the ill state of my health and what that may naturally tend to sadden you I have told you that I will not run away from life nor avoid the means that may con∣tinue it if God see fit And if he do  not  who shall repine at his will  If it shall be found that I have not acted unworthy of your love and of my own character in my greater trials that will be a happiness to both on reflection  The shock which you so earnestly advise me to try to get over was a shock the greatest that I could receive But my dear as it was not incurred by my  fault  I hope I am already got above it I hope I am  I am more grieved at times however for  others  than for  myself  And so I  ought  For as to  myself  I cannot but reflect that I have had an escape rather than a loss in missing Mr Lovelace for a husband Even had he  not  committed the vilest of all outrages  Let any one who knows my story collect his character from his behaviour to  me before  that outrage and then judge whether it was in the least probable for such a man to make me happy But to collect his character from his principles with regard to the  Sex in general  and from his enterprizes upon many of them and to consider the cru∣elty of his nature and the sportiveness of his invention together with the high opinion he has of himself it will not be doubted that a wife of his must have been misera∣ble and more miserable if she loved him than if she could have been indifferent to him  A  twelvemonth  might very probably have put a pe∣riod to my life situated as I was with my friends perse∣cuted and harassed as I had been by my brother and sister and my very heart torn in pieces by the  wilful  and as it is now apparent  premeditated  suspenses of the man whose gratitude I wished to engage and whose protection I was the more intitled to expect as he had robbed me of every other and hating my own family had reduced me to an absolute dependence upon himself This once as I thought all his view and uncomfortable enough for me if it had been all  Can it be thought my dear that my heart was not af∣fected happy as I was before I knew Mr Lovelace by such an unhappy change in my circumstancesNor perhaps was the wicked violence  wanting  to have cut short tho' not so  very  short perhaps a life that he has sported with  Had I been his but a  month  he must have possessed the estate on which my relations had set their hearts the more to their regret as they hated  him  as much as he hated  them  Have I not reason these things considered to think myself happier without Mr Lovelace than with him My will too unviolated and very little nay not anything as to him to reproach myself with  But with my  relations  it is  otherwise  They indeed de∣serve to be pitied They are and no doubt will long be unhappy  To judge of their resentments and of their conduct we must put ourselves in their situationAnd while  they  think me more in fault than themselves whether my favourers are of their opinion or not and have a right to judge for themselves they ought to have great allowances made for them my parents especially They stand at least  self  acquitted that cannot I and the rather as they can re∣collect to their pain their past indulgencies to me and their unquestionable love  Your partiality for the friend you so much value will not easily let you come into this way of thinking But only my dear be pleased to consider the matter in the following light  Here was my MOTHER one of the most prudent per∣sons  of her Sex married into a family not perhaps so happily tempered as herself but every one of which she had the address for a great while absolutely to govern as she pleased by her directing wisdom at the same time that they knew not but her prescriptions were the dictates of their own hearts such a sweet art had she of conquering by seeming to yield Think my dear what must be the pride and the pleasure of such a mother that in my bro∣ther she could give a  son  to the family she distinguished with her preferable love not unworthy of their wishes a  daughter  in my  sister  of whom she had no reason to be ashamed and in  me  a  second  daughter whom everybody complimented such was their partial favour to me as being the still more immediate likeness of herself How selfpleased could she smile round upon a family she had so blessed What compliments were paid her upon the example she had given us which were followed with such hopeful effects With what a noble confidence could she look upon her dear Mr Harlowe as a person made happy by her and be delighted to think that nothing but purity streamed from a fountain so pure  Now my dear reverse as I daily do this charming prospect See my dear  mamma  sorrowing in her closet endeavouring to suppress her sorrow at her table and in those retirements where sorrow was before a stranger Hanging down her pensive head Smiles no more beaming over her benign aspect Her virtue made to suffer for faults she could not be guilty of Her patience continually tried because she has more of it than any other with repeti∣tions of faults she is as much wounded by as those can be from whom she so often hears of them Taking to herself as the fountainhead a taint which only had in∣fected one of the undercurrents Afraid to open her lips were she willing in my favour lest it should be thought she has any byas in her own mind to failings that never otherwise could have been suspected in her Robbed of that conscious merit which the mother of hopeful chil∣dren may glory in Every one who visits her or is visited by her by dumb shew and looks that mean more than words can express condoling where they used to con∣gratulate The affected silence wounding The com∣passionating  look reminding The halfsuppressed sigh in  them  calling up deeper sighs from  her  and their averted eyes endeavouring to restrain the rising tear provoking tears from  her  that will not be restrained  When I consider these things and added to these the pangs that tear in pieces my FATHER's stronger heart be∣cause it cannot relieve itself by those tears which carry the torturing grief to the eyes of softer spirits The overboil∣ing tumults of my impatient and uncontroulable BROTHER piqued to the heart of his honour in the fall of a sister in whom he once gloried The pride of an ELDER SISTER who had given unwilling way to the honours paid over her head to one born after her And lastly the dishonour I have brought upon TWO UNCLES who each contended which should most favour their then happy niece When I say I reflect upon my fault in these strong yet just lights what room can there be to censure anybody but my unhappy self And how much reason have I to say  If I justify myself mine own heart shall condemn me If I say I am per∣fect it shall also prove me perverse  Here permit me to lay down my pen for a few moments  You are very obliging to me  intentionally  I know when you tell me It is in my power to hasten the day of Mr Hickman's happiness But yet give me leave to say that I admire this kind assurance less than any other para∣graph of your letter  In the first place you know it is  not  in my power to say  when  I can dismiss my physician and you should not put the celebration of a marriage  intended  by  yourself  and so  desirable  to your  mother  upon so precarious an issue Nor will I accept of a compliment which must mean a slight to  her  If anything could give me a relish for life after what I have suffered it would be the hopes of the continuance of the more than sisterly love which has for years unin∣terruptedly bound us together as one mindAnd why my dear should you defer giving by a tie still stronger a  o  her friend to one who has so few  I am glad you have sent my letter to Miss Montague I hope I shall hear no more of this unhappy man  I had begun the particulars of my tragical story But it is so painful a task and I have so many more important things to do and as I apprehend so little time to do them in that could I avoid it I would go no farther in it  Then to this hour I know not by what means several of his machinations to ruin me were brought about so that some material parts of my sad story must be defective if I were to sit down to write it But I have been think∣ing of a way that will answer the end wished for by your mother and you full as well perhaps better  Mr Lovelace it seems has communicated to his friend Mr Belford all that has passed between himself and me as he went on Mr Belford has not been able to deny it So that as we may observe by the way a poor young creature whose indiscretion has given a libertine power over her has a reason  she little thinks of  to regret her folly since these wretches who have no more honour in one point than in another scruple not to make her weak∣ness a part of their triumph to their brother libertines  I have nothing to apprehend of this sort if I have the justice done me in his letters which Mr Belford assures me that I have And therefore the particulars of my story and the base arts of this vile man will I think be best collected from those very letters of his if Mr Belford can be prevailed upon to communicate them to which I dare appeal with the same truth and fervor as he did who says  O that one would hear me and that mine adversary had written a bookSurely I would take it upon my shoulders and bind it to me as a crown For I covered not my trans∣gressions as Adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom  There is one way which may be fallen upon to induce Mr Belford to communicate these letters since he seems to have and declares he always had a sincere abhorrence of his friend's baseness to me But that you'll say when you hear it is a strange one Nevertheless I am very earnest upon it at present  It is no other than this  I think to make Mr Belford the Executor of my last will Don't be surprised And with this view I permit his visits with the less scruple And every time I see him from his concern for me am more and more inclined to  do so If I hold in the same mind and if he accept the trust and will communicate the materials in his power those joined with what you can furnish will answer the whole end  I know you will start at my notion of such an Executor But pray my dear consider in my present circumstances what I can do better as I am impowered to make a will and have considerable matters in my own disposal  Your mother I am sure would not consent that  you  should take this office upon you It might subject  Mr Hickman  to the insults of that violent man  Mrs Norton  cannot for several reasons respecting herself My  Brother  looks upon what I ought to have as his right My  uncle Harlowe  is already my trustee with my cousin Morden for the estate my grandfather left me But you see I could not get from my own family the few pieces I left behind me at HarlowePlace and my  uncle Antony  once threat∣ened to have my grandfather's will controverted My  Father  To be sure my dear I could not expect that my  Father  would do all I wish should be done And a  will  to be executed by a father for a daughter parts of it perhaps absolutely against his own judgment carries somewhat daring and prescriptive in the very  word  If indeed my  cousin Morden  were to come in time and would undertake this trustBut even  him  it might subject to hazards and the more as he is a man of great spirit and as the other man of  as  great looks upon me unpro∣tected as I have long been as his property  Now Mr Belford knows as I have already mentioned everything that has passed He is a man of spirit and it seems as fearless as the other with more humane qualities You don't know my dear what instances of sincere hu∣manity this Mr Belford has shewn not only on occasion of the cruel arrest but on several occasions since And Mrs Lovick has taken pains to inquire after his general character and hears a very good one of him for justice and generosity in all his concerns of  Meum  and  Tuum  as they are called He has a knowlege of lawmatters and has two executorships upon him at this time in the dis∣charge of which his honour is unquestioned  All these reasons have already in a manner determined  me to ask this favour of him altho' it will have an odd sound with it to make an intimate friend of Mr Love∣lace my Executor  This is certain My brother will be more acquiescent a great deal in such a case with the articles of my will as he will see that it will be to no purpose to controvert some of them which else I dare say he would contro∣vert or persuade my other friends to do so And who would involve an Executor in a Lawsuit if they could help it Which would be the case if anybody were left whom my brother could hope to awe or controul since my father who is governed by him has possession of all Nor would I wish you may believe to have effects torn out of my father's hands While Mr Belford who is a man of fortune and a good oeconomist in his own affairs would have no interest but to do justice  Then he exceedingly presses for some occasion to shew his readiness to serve me And he would be able to manage his violent friend over whom he has more influence than any other person  But after all I know not if it were not more eligible by far that my story should be forgotten as soon as possible and myself too And of this I shall have the less doubt if the character of my parents cannot be guarded You will forgive me my dear from the unqualified bitterness which from your affectionate zeal for me has sometimes mingled with your ink A point that ought and I insist upon it must be well considered of if anything be done which your mother and you are desirous should be done  My father has been so good as to take off from me the heavy malediction he laid me under I must be now soli∣citous for a last blessing and that is all I shall presume to ask My sister's letter communicating this grace is a se∣vere one But as she writes to me as  from everybody  how could I expect it to be otherwise  If you set out tomorrow this letter cannot reach you till you get to your aunt Harman's I shall therefore di∣rect it thither as Mr Hickman instructed me  I hope you will have met with no inconveniencies in your little journey and voyage and that you will have found in good health all whom you wish to see well  Let me recommend to you my dear that if your friends and relations in the little Island join their solicitations with your mother's commands to have your nuptials celebrated before you leave them you do not refuse to oblige them How grateful will the notification that you have done so be to  Your everfaithful and affectionate  CL HARLOWE  LETTER LXXXVII  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Miss  HARLOWE  Saturday July    I Repine not my dear sister at the severity you have been pleased to express in the letter you favoured me with because that severity was accompanied with the grace I had petitioned for And because the reproaches of my own heart are stronger than any other person's re∣proaches can be altho' I am not half so culpable as I am imagined to be as would be allowed if all the circum∣stances of my unhappy story were known and which I shall be ready to communicate to Mrs Norton if she be commissioned to inquire into them or to you my sister if you can have patience to hear them  I remembred with a bleeding heart what day the th of July was I began with the eve of it and I passed the day itselfas it was fit I should pass it Nor have I any comfort to give to my dear and everhonoured father and mother and to you my Bella but ThisThat as it was the first  unhappy  anniversary of my birth in all pro∣bability it will be the  last  Believe me my dear sister I say not this merely to move compassion but from the  best  grounds And as I think it of the highest importance to my peace of mind to obtain one further favour I would choose to owe to your intercession as my sister the leave I beg to address half a dozen lines with the hope of having them answered as I wish to either or to both my honoured parents to beg their  last blessing  This blessing is all the favour I have now to ask It is all I  dare  to ask Yet am afraid to rush at once tho' by  letter  into the presence of either And if I did not ask it it might seem to be owing to stubbornness and want of duty when my heart is all humility and penitence Only be so good as to embolden me to attempt this task Write but this one line  Clary Harlowe you are at liberty to write as you desire  This will be enough And shall to my last hour be acknowleged as the greatest favour by  Your truly penitent Sister  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXXVIII  Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday July    My dearest young Lady  I Must indeed own that I took the liberty to write to your mamma offering to inclose to her if she gave me leave yours of the th By which I thought she would see what was the state of your mind what the na∣ture of your last troubles was from the wicked arrest  what the people are where you lodge what proposals were made you from Lord M's family also your sincere peni∣tence and how much Miss Howe's writing to them in the terms she wrote in disturbed you But as you have taken the matter into your own hands and forbid me in your last to act in this nice affair unknown to you I am glad the letter was  not required of me  And indeed it may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and them since my affection for you is thought to proceed from par∣tiality  They would choose no doubt that you should owe to themselves and not to my humble mediation the favour you so earnestly sue for and which I would not have you despair of For I will venture to assure you that your mother is ready to take the first opportunity to shew her maternal tenderness for you And this I gather from seve∣ral hints I am not at liberty to explain myself upon  I long to be with you now I am better and now my son is in a fine way of recovery But is it not hard to have it signified to me that at present it will not be taken well if I goI suppose while the reconciliation which I hope will take place is negotiating by means of the cor∣respondence  so newly opened between you and your sister But if you would have me come I will rely on my good intentions and risque everyone's displeasure  Mr Brand has business in town to solicit for a bene∣fice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment And when there he is to inquire privately after your way of life and of your health  He is a very officious young man and but that your uncle Harlowe who has chosen him for this errand re∣gards him as an oracle your mother had rather anybody else had been sent  He is one of those puzzling overdoing gentlemen who think they see farther into matters than anybody else and are fond of disco  ering mysteries where there are none in order to be thought a shrewd man  I can't say I like him either in the pulpit or out of it I who had a father one of the soundest divines and finest scholars in the kingdom who never made an ostentation of what he knew but loved and venerated the gospel he taught preferring it to all other learning to be obliged to hear a young man depart from his text as soon as he has named it so contrary too to the example set him by his learned and worthy principal  Dr  Lewin  when his health permits him to preach and throwing about to a Christian and Country audience scraps of Latin and Greek from the pa∣gan classics and not always brought in with great pro∣priety neither if I am to judge by the only way given me to judge of them by the English he puts them into is an indication of something wrong either in his head or his heart or both for otherwise his education at the University must have taught him better You know my dear Miss Clary the honour I have for the Cloth It is owing to  that  that I say what I do  I know not the day he is to set out and as his inqui∣ries are to be private be pleased to take no notice of this intelligence I have no doubt that your life and conver∣sation are such as may defy the scrutinies of the most offi∣cious inquirer  I am just now told that you have written a second let∣ter  to your sister But am afraid they will wait for Mr Brand's report before further favour will be obtained from them for they will not yet believe you are so ill as I fear you are  But you would soon find that you have an indulgent mother were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination And this gives me great hopes that all will end well at last For I verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation God give a blessing to it and re∣store your health and you to all your friends prays  Your everaffectionate Servant  JUDITH NORTON  Your good mamma has privately sent me five guineas She is pleased to say to help us in the illness we have been afflicted with but more likely that I might send them to you as from myself I hope therefore I may send them up with ten more I have still left  I will send you word of Mr Morden's arrival the mo∣ment I know it  If agreeable I should be glad to know all that passes between your relations and you  LETTER LXXXIX  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON  Wednesday Aug    YOU give me my dear Mrs Norton great pleasure in hearing of yours and your son's recovery May you continue for many many years a blessing to each other  You tell me that you did actually write to my mamma  offering  to inclose mine of the th past And you say It was not  required  of you That is to say altho' you cover it over as gently as you could that your offer was reject∣ed which makes it evident that no plea will be heard for me Yet you bid me hope that the grace I sued for would  in time  be granted  The grace I then sued for was indeed granted But you are afraid you say that they will wait for Mr Brand's report before favour will be obtained in return to the se∣cond letter which I wrote to my sister And you add  That I have an indulgent mamma were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination and that all will end well at last  But what my dear Mrs Norton what is the grace I sue for in my second letter It is not that they will re∣ceive me into favour If they think it is they are mistaken I do not I cannot expect that Nor as I have often said should I if they  would  receive me bear to live in the eye of those dear friends whom I have so grievously of∣fended 'Tis only simply a blessing I ask A blessing to  die  with not to  live  withDo they know that And do they know that their unkindness will perhaps shorten my date So that their favour if ever they intend to grant it may come too late  Once more I desire you not to think of coming to me I have no uneasiness now but what proceeds from the apprehension of seeing a man I would not see for the world if I could help it and from the severity of my nearest and dearest relations A severity intirely their own I doubt for you tell me that my brother is at Edinburgh You would therefore heighten their severity and make yourself enemies besides if you were to come to me Don't you see that you would  Mr Brand may come if he will He is a Clergyman and must mean well or I must think so let him say of me what he will All my fear is that as he knows I am in disgrace with a family whose esteem he is desirous to cultivate and as he has obligations to my uncle Harlowe and to my father he will be but a languid acquitter Not that I am afraid of what he or anybody in the world can hear as to my conduct You may my beloved and dear friend indeed you may rest satisfied that That is such as may warrant me to challenge the inquiries of the most officious  I will send you copies of what passes as you desire when I have an answer to my second letter I now begin to wish that I had taken the heart to write to my father himself or to my mother at least instead of to my sister and yet I doubt my poor mother can do nothing for me of  herself  A strong confederacy my dear Mrs Norton a strong confederacy indeed against a poor girl their daugh∣ter  sister niece My brother perhaps got it renewed before he left them He needed notHis work is done and more than done  Don't afflict yourself about moneymatters on my ac∣count I have no occasion for money I am glad my mother was so considerate to you I was in pain for you on the same subject But Heaven will not permit so good a wo∣man to want the humble blessings she was always satisfied with I wish every individual of our family were but as rich as youO my mamma Norton you are rich You are rich indeedThe true riches are such content as you are blessed with And I hope in God that I am in the way to be rich too  Adieu my everindulgent friend You say all will be at last happy And I  know  it will I confide that it will with as much security as you may that I will be to my last hour  Your evergrateful and affectionate  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XC  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Aug    I AM most confoundedly chagrined and disappointed For here on Saturday arrived a messenger from Miss Howe with a letter to my cousins  See Letter  lxxx  p    which I knew nothing of till yesterday when my two aunts were pro∣cured to be here to sit in judgment upon it with the old Peer and my two kinswomen And never was Bear so miserably baited as thy poor friendAnd for what Why for the cruelty of Miss Harlowe For have I com∣mitted any  new  offence And would I not have succeeded in her favour upon her own terms if I could And is it fair to punish me for what is my misfortune and not my fault Such eventjudging fools as I have for my relations I am ashamed of them all  In that of Miss Howe was inclosed one to  her  from Miss Harlowe  See Letter  lxxvi  p    to be sent to my cousins containing a final rejec∣tion of me and that in very vehement and positive terms  yet pretends that in this rejection she is governed more by  principle  than  passion  Damn'd lye as ever was told And as a proof that she is says that she  can  forgive me and  does  on this one condition That I will never molest her more The whole letter so written as to make  herself  more admired  me  more detested  What we have been told of the agitations and work∣ings and sighings and sobbings of the French prophets among us formerly were nothing at all to the scene ex∣hibited by these maudlin souls at the reading of these let∣ters and of some affecting passages extracted from an∣other of my fair Implacable's to Miss HoweSuch lamenta∣tions for the loss of so charming a relation Such applaud∣ings of her virtue of her exaltedness of soul and sentiment Such menaces of disinherisons I not needing  their  re∣proaches to be stung to the heart with my own reflec∣tions and with the rage of disappointment and as sin∣cerely as any of them admiring her What the devil cried I▪ is all this for Is it not enough to be despised and rejected Can I help her implacable spiritWould I not repair the evils I have made her sufferThen was I ready to curse them all herself and Miss Howe for com∣panyAnd heartily I swore that she should yet be mine  I now swear it overagain to theeWere her death to follow in a week after the knot is ty'd by the Lord of Heaven it  shall  be ty'd and she shall die a Lovelace Tell her so if thou wilt But at the same time tell her that I have no  view to her fortune  and that I will solemnly resign that and all pretensions to it in whose favour she pleases if she resign life issueless I am not so lowminded a wretch as to be  guilty  of any sordid views to her fortune Let her judge for herself then whether it be not for her honour rather to leave this world a Lovelace than a Harlowe  But do not think I will intirely rest a cause so near my heart upon an advocate who so much more admires his client's adversary than his client I will go to town in a few days in order to throw myself at her feet Bringing with me or having at hand a  resolute wellprepared  par∣son and the ceremony shall be performed let what will be the consequence  But if she will permit me to attend her for this purpose at either of the churches mentioned in the licence which she has by her and thank Heaven has not returned me with my letters then will I not disturb her but meet her at the altar in either church and will engage to bring my two cousins to attend her and even Lady Sarah and Lady Betty and my Lord M in person to give her to me  Or if it will be still more agreeable to her I will un∣dertake that either or both my aunts shall go to town and attend her down and the marriage shall be celebrated in theirs and Lord M's presence here or elsewhere at her own choice  Do not play me booty Belford but sincerely and warmly use all the eloquence thou art master of to pre∣vail upon her to choose one of these three methods One of them she  must  choose By my soul she must  Here is Charlotte tapping at my closetdoor for admit∣tance What a devil wants Charlotte I will bear no more reproachesCome in girl  MY cousin Charlotte finding me writing on with too much earnestness to have any regard for politeness to her and guessing at my subject besought me to let her see what I had written  I obliged her And she was so highly pleased on seeing me so much in earnest that  she  offered and I accepted her offer to write herself to Miss Harlowe with permis∣sion to treat me in it as she thought fit  I shall inclose a copy of her letter  When she  had  written it she brought it to me with apologies for the freedom taken with me in it But I ex∣cused it and she was ready to give me a kiss for joy of my approbation And I gave her two for writing it tell∣ing her I had hopes of success from it and that I thought she had luckily hit it off  Everyone approves of it as well as I and is pleased with me for so patiently submitting to be abused and undertaken for If it do not succeed all the blame will be thrown upon the dear creature's perverseness Her cha∣ritable or forgiving disposition about which she makes such a parade will be justly questioned and the pity of  which she is now in full possession will be transferred to me  Putting therefore my whole confidence in this letter I postpone all my other alternatives as also my going to town till my empress send an answer to my cousin Mon∣tague  But if she persist and will not promise to take time to  consider  of the matter thou mayest communicate to her what I had written as above before my cousin entered and if she be still perverse assure her that I  must  and  will  see her But this with all honour all humility And if I cannot move her in my favour I will then go abroad and perhaps never more return to England  I am sorry thou art at  this critical time  so busily employed as thou informest me thou art in thy Watford affairs and in preparing to do Belton justice If thou wantest my assistance in the latter command me Tho' ingrossed and plagued as I am with this perverse beauty I will obey thy first summons  I have great dependence upon thy zeal and thy friend∣ship Hasten back to her therefore and resume a task  so  interesting to me that it is equally the subject of my dreams as of my waking hours  LETTER XCI  Miss  MONTAGUE  To Miss  CLAR HARLOWE  Tuesday Aug    Dearest Madam  ALL our family is deeply sensible of the injuries you have received at the hands of one of it whom You only can render in any manner worthy of the relation he stands in to us all And if as an act of mercy and charity the greatest your pious heart can shew you will be pleased to look over his past wickedness and ingratitude and suffer yourself to be our kinswoman you will make us the hap∣piest family in the world And I can engage that Lord M and Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance and my Sister who are all admirers of your virtues and of your nobleness of mind will for ever love and reve∣rence you and do everything in all our powers to make you amends for what you have suffered from Mr Love∣lace  This Madam we should not however dare to petition for were we not assured that he is most sincerely sorry for his past vileness to you and that he will on his knees beg your pardon and vow eternal love and honour to you  Wherefore  my dearest cousin  How you will charm us all if this agreeable style may be permitted for  all  our sakes for his  soul  's sake You must I am sure be so good a lady as to wish to save a soul and allow me to say for  your own fame  's sake condescend to our joint requests And if by way of encouragement you will but say you will be glad to see and to be as much known personally as you are by fame to Charlotte Montague I will in two days time from the receipt of your permission wait upon you  with  or  without  my sister and receive your further commands  Let me  our dearest cousin  we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of calling you so let me intreat you to give me your permission for my journey to London and put it in the power of Lord M and of the Ladies of the family to make you what reparation they can make you for the injuries which a person of the greatest merit in the world has received from one of the most audacious men in it and you will infinitely oblige us all and particularly her who repeatedly presumes to style herself  Your affectionate  cousin  and obliged Servant  CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE  LETTER XCII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday morning Aug    six o'clock  I Have been so much employed in my own and Belton's affairs that I could not come to town till last night having contented myself with sending to Mrs Lovick to know from time to time the state of the lady's health of which I received but very indifferent accounts owing in a great measure to letters or advices brought her from her implacable family  I have now completed my own affairs and next week shall go to Epsom to endeavour to put Belton's sister into  possession of his own house for him After which I shall devote myself wholly to your service and to that of the lady  I was admitted to her presence last night and found her visibly altered for the worse When I went home I had your letter of Tuesday last put into my hands Let me tell thee Lovelace that I insist upon the performance of thy engagement to me that thou wilt not personally molest her  Mr Belford dates again on Thursday morning    o' clock and gives an account of a conversation which he had just held with the lady upon the subject of Miss Monta∣gue's letter to her preceding and upon Mr Lovelace's alternatives as mentioned in Letter N  o    XC  which Mr Belford supported with the utmost earnestness But as the result of this conversation will be found in the sub∣sequent letters Mr Belford's pleas and arguments and the lady's answers are omitted  LETTER XCIII  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  MONTAGUE  Thursday Aug    Dear Madam  I AM infinitely obliged to you for your kind and con∣descending letter A letter however which height∣ens my regrets as it gives me a new instance of what a happy creature I might have been in an alliance so much approved of by such worthy Ladies and which on their accounts and on that of Lord M would have been so re∣putable to myself and once so desirable  But indeed indeed Madam my heart sincerely re∣pulses the man who descended from such a family could be guilty  first  of such premeditated violence as he has been guilty of and as  he  knows  further  intended me on the night previous to the day he set out for Berkshire and  next  pretending to spirit be so mean as to wish to lift into that family a person he was capable of abasing into a companionship with the most abandoned of her Sex  Allow me then dear Madam to declare with fervour that I think I never could deserve to be ranked with the  Ladies of a family so splendid and so noble if by vowing love and honour at the altar to such a violator I could  sanctify  as I may say his unprecedented and elaborate wickedness  Permit me however to make one request to my good Lord M and to the two Ladies his Lordship's sisters and to your kind self and your sister It is That you will all be pleased to join your authority and interests to prevail upon Mr Lovelace not to molest me further  Be pleased to tell him That if I am designed for  life  it will be very cruel in him to attempt to hunt me out of it for I am determined never to see him more if I can help it The more cruel because he knows that I have nobody to protect me from him Nor do I wish to engage anybody to  his  hurt or to their own  If I am on the other hand destined for  death  it will be no less cruel if he will not permit me to die in peace Since a peaceable and happy end I wish him Indeed I do  Every worldly good attend you dear Madam and every branch of the honourable family is the wish of one whose misfortune it is that she is obliged to disclaim any other title than That of  Dear Madam  Your and Their obliged and faithful Servant  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XCIV  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday afternoon Aug    I AM just now agreeably surprised by the following let∣ter delivered into my hands by a messenger from the lady The letter she mentions as inclosed  See Miss Montague's Letter preceding  I have returned without taking a copy of it The contents of it will soon be communicated to you I presume by another way They contain an absolute rejection of thee  Poor Lovelace    To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Aug    SIR  YOU have frequently offered to oblige me in anything that shall be within your power And I have such an opinion of you as to be willing to hope you meant me at the times more than mere compliment  I have therefore two requests to make to you the first I will now mention the other if this shall be comply'd with otherwise not  It behoves me to leave behind me such an account as may clear up my conduct to several of my friends who will not at present concern themselves about me And Mi  s Howe and her mother are very solicitous that I will do so  I am apprehensive that I shall not have time to do this and you will not wonder that I have less and less in∣clination to set about such a painful task especially as I find myself unable to look back with patience on what I have suffered and shall be too much discomposed by it to proceed with the requisite temper in a task of  still greater  importance which I have before me  It is very evident to me that your wicked friend has given you from time to time a circumstantial account of all his behaviour  to  me and devices  against  me and you have more than once assured me that both by writing and speech he has done my character all the justice I could wish for  Now Sir if I may have a fair a faithful specimen from his letters or accounts to you upon some of the most interesting occasions I shall be able to judge whether there will or will not be a necessity for me for my honour's sake to enter upon the solicited task  You may be assured from my inclosed answer to the letter which Miss Montague has honoured me with and which you'll be pleased to return me as soon as read that it is impossible for me ever to think of your friend in the way I am importuned to think of him He cannot there∣fore receive any detriment from the requested specimen And I give you my honour that no use shall be made of it to his prejudice in Law or otherwise And that it  may  not  after I am no more I assure you that it is a  main part of my view  that the passages you shall oblige me with shall be always in your own power and not in that of any other person  If Sir you think fit to comply with my request the passages I would wish to be transcribed making neither better nor worse of the matter are those which he has written to you on or about the th and th of June when I was alarmed by the wicked pretence of a fire and what he has written from Sunday June to the th And in doing this you will much oblige  Your humble Servant  CL HARLOWE  Now Lovelace since there are no hopes for thee of her returning favour Since some praise may lie for thy in∣genuity having never offered as more diminutiveminded libertines would have done to palliate thy crimes by aspersing the lady or her sex Since she may be made easier by it Since thou must fare better from thy own pen than from hers and finally Since thy actions have mani∣fested that thy letters are not the most guilty part of what she  knows  of thee I see not why I may not oblige her upon her honour and under the restrictions and for the reasons she has given and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communications especially as I might have added  Since thou gloriest in thy pen and in thy wicked∣ness and canst not be ashamed  But be this as it may she  will  be obliged before thy remonstrances or clamours against it can come so pr'ythee now make the best of it and rave not except for the sake of a pretence against me and to exercise thy talent of execrationAnd if thou likest to do so for these rea∣sons rave and welcome  I long to know what the second request is But this I know that if it be anything less than cutting  thy  throat or endangering  my own  neck I will certainly comply and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her  And now I am actually going to be busy in the Ex∣tracts  LETTER XCV  Mr  BELFORD  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Aug    Madam  YOU have engaged me to communicate to you upon honour making neither better nor worse of the matter what Mr Lovelace has written to me in relation to yourself in the period preceding your going to Ham∣stead and in that between the th and th of June And you assure me you have no view in this request but to see if it be necessary for you from the account he gives to touch the painful subjects yourself for the sake of your own character  Your commands Madam are of a very delicate na∣ture as they may seem to affect the secrets of private friend∣ship But as I know you are not capable of a view the motives to which you will not own and as I think the communication may do some credit to my unhappy friend's character as an  ingenuous  man tho' his actions by the most excellent woman in the world have lost him all title to that of an  honourable  one I obey you with the greater chearfulness  He then proceeds with his extracts and concludes them with an address to her in his friend's behalf in the following words  And now Madam I have fulfilled your commands and I hope not disserved my friend with you since you will hereby see the justice he does to your virtue in every line he writes He does the same in all his letters tho' to his own condemnation And give me leave to add that if this everamiable sufferer could but think it in any manner consistent with her honour to receive his vows at the altar on his truly penitent turn of mind I have not the least doubt but that he would make her the best and tenderest of husbands What obligation would not the admirable lady hereby lay upon all  his  noble fa∣mily who so greatly admire her and I will presume to say upon  her own  when the unhappy family aver∣sion which certainly has been carried to an unreasonable  height against him is got over and a general reconci∣liation take place For who is it that would not give these two admirable persons to each other were not his morals an objection  However this be I would humbly refer to you Ma∣dam whether as you will be mistress of very delicate par∣ticulars from  me  his friend you should not in honour think yourself concerned to pass them by as if you had never seen them and not to take any advantage of the commu∣nication not even in argument as some perhaps might lie with respect to the  premeditated  design he seems to have had not against you  as  you but as against the  Sex  over whom I am sorry I can bear witness myself it is the vil∣lainous aim of all libertines to triumph And I would not if any misunderstanding should arise between him and me give him room to reproach me that his losing of you or thro' his usage of you  his losing of his own friends were owing to what perhaps he would call breach of trust were he to judge rather by the events if such should hap∣pen than by my intention  I am Madam with the most profound veneration  Your most faithful humble Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER XCVI  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Friday Aug    SIR  I Hold myself extremely obliged to you for your com∣munications I will make no use of them that you shall have reason to reproach either yourself or me with I wanted no new lights to make the unhappy man's pre∣meditated baseness to me unquestionable as my answer to Miss Montague's letter might convince you  See Letter  xciii    I must own in his favour that he has observed some decency in his accounts to you of the most indecent and shocking actions And if all his strangelycommunicative narrations are equally decent nothing will be rendered criminally odious by them but the vile heart that could meditate such contrivances as were much stronger evidences of his inhumanity than of his wit Since men of very  contemptible parts and understanding may succeed in the vilest attempts if they can get above regarding the moral sanctions which bind man to man and sooner upon an innocent heart than upon any other because knowing its own integrity it is the less apt to suspect that of others  I find I have had great reason to think myself obliged to your intention in the whole progress of my sufferings It is however impossible Sir to miss the natural infer∣ence on this occasion that lies against his predetermined baseness But I say the less because you shall not think I borrow from your communications aggravations that are not needed  And now Sir that I may spare you the trouble of offer∣ing any future arguments in his favour let me tell you that I have weighed everything thoroughly All that hu∣man vanity could suggest All that a desirable reconcilia∣tion with my friends and the kind respects of his own could bid me hope for The enjoyment of Miss Howe's friendship the dearest consideration to me now of all worldly ones All these I have weighed And the result is and  was  before you favoured me with these communi∣cations that I have more satisfaction in the hope that in one month there will be an end of All with me than in the most agreeable things that could happen from an alli∣ance with Mr Lovelace altho' I were to be assured he would make the best and tenderest of husbands But as to the rest If satisfied with the evils he has brought up∣on me he will forbear all further persecutions of me I will to my last hour wish him good Altho'  he hath over∣whelmed the fatherless and digged a pit for his friend  Fa∣therless may  she  well be called and motherless too who has been denied all paternal protection and motherly for∣giveness  AND now Sir acknowleging gratefully your favour in the Extracts I come to the second part of my request Which requires a great deal of courage to mention to you And which courage nothing but a great deal of distress and a very destitute condition can give But if impro∣per I can but be denied and dare to say I shall be at least excused Thus then I preface it  You see Sir that I am thrown absolutely into the hands of strangers who altho' as kind and compassionate as strangers can be wished to be are nevertheless persons from whom I cannot expect anything more than pity and good wishes nor can my memory receive from them any more protection than my person if either should need it  If then I request it of the  only  gentleman possessed of materials that will enable him to do my character justice  And who has courage independence and ability to ob∣lige me  To be the protector of my memory as I may say  And to be my  Executor  and to see some of my dying requests performed  And if I leave it to him to do the whole in his own way manner and time consulting however in requi∣site cases my dear Miss Howe  I presume to hope that this part of my request may be granted  And if it may These satisfactions will accrue to me from the favour done me and the office undertaken  It will be an honour to my memory with all those who shall know that I was so well satisfied of my innocence that having not time to write my own story I could in∣trust it to the relation which the destroyer of my fame and fortunes has given of it  I shall not be apprehensive of involving any one in trou∣bles or hazards by this task either with my own relations or with your friend having dispositions to make which perhaps my own friends will not be so well pleased with as it were to be wished they would be for I intend not unreasonable ones But you know Sir where  Self  is judge matters even with  good people  will not always be rightly judged of  I shall also be freed from the pain of recollecting things that my soul is vexed at and this at a time when its tu∣mults should be allay'd in order to make way for the most important preparation  And who knows but that the man who already from a principle of humanity is touched at my misfortunes when he comes to revolve the whole story placed before  him in one strong light and when he shall have the cata∣strophe likewise before him and shall become in a man∣ner interested in it Who knows but that from a still higher principle he may so regulate his future actions as to find his own reward in the everlasting welfare which is wished him by his  Obliged Servant  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XCVII  Mr  BELFORD  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Friday Aug    Madam  I AM so sensible of the honour done me in yours of this day that I would not delay for one moment the an∣swering of it I hope you will live to see many happy years and to be your own Executrix in those points which your heart is most set upon But in case of survivorship I most chearfully accept of the sacred office you are pleased to offer me and you may absolutely rely upon my fide∣lity and if possible upon the literal performance of every article you shall injoin me  The effect of the kind wish you conclude with has been my concern ever since I have been admitted to the ho∣nour of your conversation It shall be my whole endea∣vour that it be not vain The happiness of approaching you which this trust as I presume will give me frequent opportunities of doing must necessarily promote the de∣sirable end since it will be impossible to be a witness of your piety equanimity and other virtues and not aspire to emulate you All I beg is That you will not suffer any future candidate or event to displace me unless some new instances of unworthiness appear either in the morals or behaviour of  Madam  Your most obliged and faithful Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER XCVIII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday night Aug    I Have actually delivered to the lady the extracts she re∣quested me to give her from thy letters I do assure thee that I have made the very best of the matter for thee  not  that conscience but that friendship could oblige me to make I have changed or omitted some free words The warm description of her person in the  firescene  as I may call it I have omitted I have told her that I have done justice to you in the justice you have done to her unexampled virtue But take the very words which I wrote to her immediately following the extracts  'And now Madam'  See the paragraph marked with inverted commas  'thus p  The lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit her For Heaven's sake your word being given and for Pity's sake for she is really in a very weak and languishing way let me beg of you not to think of it  Yesterday afternoon she received a cruel letter as Mrs Lovick supposes it to be by the effect it had upon her from her sister in answer to one written last Saturday intreating a blessing and forgiveness from her parents  She acknowleges that if all thy letters are written with equal decency and justice as I have assured her they are she shall think herself freed from the necessity of write∣ing her own story And this is an advantage to the  ac∣cruing from the extracts I have obliged her with tho' thou perhaps wilt not thank me for so doing  But what thinkest thou is the second request she had to make to me No other than that I would be her  Execu∣tor  Her motives will appear before thee in proper time and then I dare answer for them will be satisfac∣tory  You cannot imagine how proud I am of this trust I am afraid I shall too soon come into the execution of it As she is always writing what a melancholy pleasure  will the perusal and disposition of her papers afford me Such a sweetness of temper so much patience and resigna∣tion as she seems to be mistress of yet writing of and in the midst of  present  distresses How much more lively and affecting for that reason must her stile be than all that can be read in the dry narrative unanimated stile of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted The minds of such not labouring in suspense not tortured by the pangs of uncertainty about events still hidden in the womb of fate but on the contrary perfectly at ease the relater unmoved by his own story how then able to move the hearer or reader  Saturday morning Aug    I AM just returned from visiting the lady and thank∣ing her in person for the honour she has done me and assuring her if called to the sacred trust of the utmost fidelity and exactness I found her very ill I took notice of it She said She had received a second hardhearted letter from her sister and she had been writing a letter and that on her knees directly to her mother which be∣fore she had not the courage to do It was for a last bless∣ing and forgiveness No wonder she said that I saw her affected Now that I had accepted of the last charitable office for her for which as well as for complying with her other request she thanked me I should one day have all these letters before me And could she have a kind one in return to that she had been now writing to coun∣terbalance the unkind one she had from her sister she might be induced to shew me both together  I knew she would be displeased if I had censured the cruelty of her relations I therefore only said That surely she must have enemies who hoped to find their account in keeping up the resentments of her friends against her  It may be so Mr Belford said she The unhappy never want enemies One fault wilfully committed au∣thorizes the imputation of many more Where the ear is opened to accusations accusers will not be wanting and everyone will officiously come with stories against a disgraced child where nothing dare be said in her fa∣vour I should have been wise in time and not have needed to be convinced by my own misfortunes of the  truth of what common experience daily demonstrates Mr Lovelace's baseness my father's inflexibility my sister's reproaches are the natural consequences of my own rash∣ness so I must make the best of my hard lot Only as these consequences follow one another so closely while they are  new  how can I help being anew affected  I asked If a letter written by myself by her doctor or apothecary to any of her friends representing her low state of health and great humility would be acceptable Or if a journey to any of them would be of service I would gladly undertake it in person and strictly conform to her orders to whomsoever she would direct me to apply  She earnestly desired that nothing of this sort might be attempted especially without her knowlege and consent Miss Howe she said had done harm by her kindlyin∣tended zeal and if there were room to expect favour by mediation she had ready at hand a kind friend Mrs Norton who for piety and prudence had few equals and who would let slip no opportunity to do her service  I let her know that I was going out of town till Mon∣day She wish'd me pleasure and said she should be glad to see me on my return  Adieu  LETTER XCIX Miss  AR HARLOWE  To Miss  CR HARLOWE  In Answer to hers of Saturday July    p      Thursday morn Aug    Sister  CLARY  I Wish you would not trouble me with any more of your letters You had always a knack at writing and de∣pended upon making every one do what you would when you wrote But your wit and your folly have undone you And now as all naughty creatures do when they can't help themselves you come begging and praying and make others as uneasy as yourself  When I wrote last to you I  expected  that I should not be at rest  And so you'd creep on by little and little till you'll want to be received again  But you only hope for  forgiveness  and a  blessing  you  say A blessing for what sister Clary Think for what However I read your letter to my father and mother  I won't tell you what my papa saidOne who has the true sense you boast to have of your misdeeds may guess without my telling you what a justly incensed father would say on such an occasion  My poor mammaO wretch What has not your in∣grateful folly cost my poor mammaHad you been less a darling you would not perhaps have been so graceless But I never in my life saw a cocker'd favourite come to good  My heart is full and I can't help writing my mind for your crimes have disgraced us all and I am afraid and ashamed to go to any public or private assemblée or diversion And why I  need  not say why when your actions are the subjects either of the open talk or of the affronting whispers of both sexes at all such places  Upon the whole I am sorry I have no more comfort to send you But I find nobody willing to forgive you I don't know what  time  may do for you and when it is seen that your penitence is not owing more to disappoint∣ment than true conviction For it is too probable Miss Clary that had you gone on as swimmingly as you ex∣pected and had not your featherheaded villain abandoned you we should have heard nothing of these moving sup∣plications Nor of anything but defiances from  him  and a guilt gloried in from  you  And this is everyone's opi∣nion as well as that of  Your grieved Sister  ARABELLA HARLOWE  I send this by a particular hand who undertakes to give it you or leave it for you by tomorrow night  LETTER C  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To her Mother  Sat Aug    Honoured Madam  NO selfconvicted criminal ever approached her angry and just judge with greater awe nor with a truer contrition than I do you by these lines  Indeed I must say that if the matter of my humble  prayer had not respected my future welfare I had not dared to take this liberty But my heart is set upon it as upon a thing next to God Almighty's forgiveness ne∣cessary for me  Had my happy sister known my distresses she would not have wrung my heart as she has done by a severity which I must needs think unkind and unsisterly  But complaint of any unkindness from her belongs not to me Yet as she is pleased to write that it must be seen that my penitence is less owing to disappointment than to true conviction permit me Madam to insist upon it that I am actually  intitled  to the blessing I sue for since my humble prayer is founded upon a true and unfeigned repentance And this you will the readier believe if the creature who never to the best of her remembrance told her mamma a wilful falshood may be credited when she declares as she does in the most solemn manner that she met the seducer with a determination not to go off with him That the rash step was owing more to com∣pulsion than infatuation And that her heart was so little in it that she repented and grieved from the moment she found herself in his power and for every moment after for several weeks  before  she had any cause from him to ap∣prehend the usage she met with  Wherefore on my knees my everhonoured mamma for on my knees I write this letter I do most humbly beg your Blessing Say but in so many words I ask you not to call me your daughter  Lost unhappy wretch I forgive you and may God bless you  This is all Let me on a blessed scrap of paper but see one sentence to this effect under your dear hand that I may hold it to my heart in my most trying struggles and I shall think it a passport to Heaven And if I do not too much pre∣sume and it were WE instead of I and  both  your honour∣ed names subjoined to it I should then have nothing more to wish Then would I say  Great and merciful God thou seest here in this paper thy poor unworthy creature absolved by her justlyoffended parents O join for my Redeemer's sake thy allgracious  Fiat  and receive a repentant sinner to the arms of thy mercy  I can conjure you Madam by no subject of motherly  tenderness that will not in the opinion of my severe cen∣surers before whom this humble address must appear add to my reproach Let me therefore for God's sake pre∣vail upon you to pronounce me blest and forgiven since you will thereby sprinkle comfort thro' the last hours of  Your  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CI Miss  MONTAGUE  To Miss  CL HARLOWE  In Answer to hers of Thursday Aug    See p      Monday Aug    Dear Madam  WE were all of opinion  before  your letter came that Mr Lovelace was utterly unworthy of you and deserved condign punishment rather than the blessing of such a wife And hoped far  more  from your kind con∣sideration for  us  than any we supposed you could have for so base an  injurer  For we were all determined to love you and admire you let  his  behaviour to you be what it would  But after your letter what can be said  I am however commanded to write in all the sub∣scribing names to let you know how greatly your suf∣ferings have affected us To tell you that my Lord M has forbid him ever more to darken the doors of the apart∣ments where he shall be And as you labour under the unhappy effects of your friends displeasure which may subject you to inconveniencies his Lordship and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty beg of you to accept for your life or at least till you are admitted to enjoy your own estate of one hundred guineas  per  quarter which will be regu∣larly brought you by an especial hand and of the inclosed Bank bill for a beginning And do not dearest Madam we all beseech you do not think you are beholden for this token of Lord M's and Lady Sarah's and Lady Betty's love to you to the  friends of this vile man  for he has not one friend left among us  We each of us desire to be favoured with a place in your esteem and to be considered upon the same foot of relationship as if what once was so much our pleasure to  hope  would  be  had  been And it shall be our united prayer that you may recover health and spirits and live to see many happy years And since this wretch can no more be pleaded for that when he is gone abroad as he now is preparing to do we may be permitted the honour of a personal acquaintance with a lady who has no equal These are the earnest requests dearest young Lady of  Your affectionate Friends and most faithful Servants  M  SARAH SADLEIR  ELIZ LAWRANCE  CHARL MONTAGUE  MARTH MONTAGUE  You will break the hearts of the three firstnamed more particularly if you refuse them your acceptance Dearest Miss Harlowe punish not  them  for  his  crimes We send by a particular hand which will bring us we hope your accepting favour  Mr Lovelace writes by the same hand but he knows nothing of ours nor we of his For we shun each other and one part of the house holds  us  another  him  the remotest from each other  LETTER CII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Aug    I Am so excessively disturbed at the contents of Miss Harlowe's answer to my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday last which was given her by the same fellow that gave me yours that I have hardly patience or considera∣tion enough to weigh what you write  She had need indeed to cry out for mercy herself from  her  friends who knows not how to shew any She is a true daughter of the HarlowesBy my soul Jack she is a true daughter of the Harlowes Yet has she so many excellencies that I must love her and fool that I am love her the more for her despising me  Thou runnest on with thy cursed nonsensical  reformado  rote  of dying dying dying and having once got the word by the end canst not help foisting it in at every pe∣riod The devil take me if I don't think thou wouldst give her poison with thy own hands rather than she should re∣cover and rob thee of the merit of being a conjurer  But no more of thy cursed knell thy changes upon death's candlestick turned bottomupwards She'll live to bury me I see that For by my soul I can neither eat drink nor sleep nor what's still worse love any woman in the world but her Nor care I to look upon a woman now on the contrary I turn my head from every one I meet except by chance an eye an air a feature strikes me resembling hers in some glancingby face and then I cannot forbear looking again tho' the second look recovers me for there can be nobody like her  But surely Belford the devil's in this lady The more I think of her nonsense and obstinacy the less patience I have with her Is it possible she can do herself her fa∣mily her friends so much justice any  other  way as by marrying me Were she sure she should live but a day she ought to die a wife If her  Christian revenge  will not let her wish to do so for her  own  sake ought she not for the sake of her family and of her Sex which she pretends sometimes to have so much concern for And if no  sake  is dear enough to move her Harlowespirit in my favour has she any title to the pity thou so pitifully art always be∣speaking for her  As to the difference which her letter has made between me and the stupid family here and I must tell thee we are all broke in pieces I value not that of a button They are fools to anathematize and curse me who can give them ten curses for one were they to hold it for a day together  I have one half of the house to myself and that the best for the Great enjoy that least which costs them most  Grandeur  and  Use  are two things The common part is theirs the state part is mine And here I lord it and  will  lord it as long as I please while the two pursy sisters the old gouty brother and the two musty nieces are stived up in the other half and dare not stir for fear of meeting me Whom that's the jest of it they have forbidden coming into their apartments as I have them into mine And so  I have them all prisoners while I range about as I please Pretty dogs and doggesses to quarrel and bark at me and yet whenever I appear afraid to pop out of their kennels or if out before they see me at the sight of me run growling in again with their flapt ears their sweeping dewlaps and their quivering tails curling inwards  And here while I am thus worthily waging war with beetles drones wasps and hornets and am all on fire with the rage of slighted love thou art regaling thyself with phlegm and rockwater and art going on with thy re∣formationscheme and thy exultations in my misfortunes  The devil take thee for an insensible doughbak'd varlet I have no more patience with thee than with the lady for thou knowest nothing either of love or friendship but art as incapable of the one as unworthy of the other else wouldst thou not rejoice as thou dost under the  grimace of pity  in my disappointments  And thou art a pretty fellow art thou not to engage to transcribe for her some parts of my letters written to thee in confidence Letters that thou shouldest sooner have parted with thy cursed tongue than have owned thou ever hadst received such Yet these are now to be communi∣cated to  her  But I charge thee and woe be to thee if it be too late that thou do not oblige her with a line of mine  If thou  hast  done it the least vengeance I will take is to break thro'  my  honour given to thee not to visit her as thou wilt have broken thro'  thine  to me in communicating letters written under the seal of friendship  I am now convinced too sadly for my hopes by her letter to my cousin Charlotte that she is determined never to have me  Unprecedented wickedness  she calls mine to her But how does  she  know what the ardor of flaming love will stimu∣late How does  she  know the requisite distinctions of the words she uses in this caseTo think the  worst  and to be able to  make comparisons  in these  very  delicate situations must she not be less delicate than I had imagined her to be But she has heard that the devil is black and having a mind to make one of me brays together in the mortar of her wild fancy twenty chimneysweepers in order to make one sootier than ordinary rise out of the dirty mass  But what a whirlwind does she raise in my soul by her proud contempts of me Never never was mortal man's pride so mortified How does she sink me even in my own eyes Her heart sincerely repulses me she says for my MEANNESSYet she intends to reap the benefit of what she calls so Curse upon her  haughtiness  and her  meanness  at the same timeHer haughtiness to  me  and her meanness to  her own relations  more unworthy of kindred with her than I can be or I am  mean  indeed  Yet who but must admire who but must adore her O that cursed cursed house But for the women of that Then their damn'd potions But for  those  had her  un∣impaired  intellects and the  majesty of her virtue  saved her as once it did by her humble eloquence  In the firescene Vol  iv  p    another time by her terrifying menaces against her own life  Vol  v  Letter  L    Yet in both these to find her power over me and my love for her and to hate to despise and to refuse meShe might have done this with some shew of justice had the lastintended violation been perpetratedBut to go away conqueress and triumphant in every lightWell may she despise me for suffering her to do so  She left me  low  and  mean  indeedAnd the impression holds with her I could tear my flesh that I gave her not causethat I humbled her not  indeed  or that I staid not in town till I could have exalted myself by giving myself a wife superior to all trial to all temptation  I will venture one more letter to her however and if that don't do or procure me an answer then will I en∣deavour to see her let what  will  be the consequence If she get out of my way I will do some noble mischief to the vixen girl whom she most loves and then quit the kingdom for ever  And now Jack since thy hand is in at communicating the contents of private letters tell her this if thou wilt And add to it That if SHE abandon me GOD will and it is no matter  then  what becomes of  Her  LOVELACE  LETTER CIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    In Answer to his of Friday night Aug    p    Monday Aug    AND so you have actually delivered to the fair Implacable extracts of letters written in the confidence of friend∣ship Take careTake care BelfordI do indeed love you better than I love any man in the world But this is a very delicate point The matter is grown very serious to me My heart is bent upon having her And have her I will tho' I marry her in the agonies of death  She is very earnest you say that I will not offer to mo∣lest her  That  let me tell her will absolutely depend upon herself and the answer she returns whether by pen and ink or the contemptuous one of silence which she be∣stowed upon my last four to her And I will write it in such humble and in such reasonable terms that if she is not a true Harlowe she  shall  forgive me But as to the  executorship  she is for conferring upon theeThou shalt not be her  executor  Let me perish if thou shalt Nor shall she die Nobody shall be anything nobody shall  dare  to be anything to her but me Thy happiness is already too great to be admitted daily to her presence to look upon her to talk to her to hear her talk while I am forbid to come within view of her windowWhat a reprobation is this of the man who was once more dear to her than all the men in the world And now to be able to look down upon me while her exalted head is hid from me among the stars sometimes with low scorn at other times with abject pity I cannot bear it  This I tell thee that if I have not success in my effort by letter I will overcome the creeping folly that has found its way to my heart or I will tear it out in her presence and throw it at hers that she may see how much more tender than her own that organ is which she and you and everyone else have taken the liberty to call callous  Give notice to the people who live back and edge and on either hand of the cursed mother to remove their best effects if I am rejected For the first vengeance I  shall take will be to set fire to that den of serpents Nor will there be any fear of taking them when they are in any act that has  the relish of salvation in it  as Shakespeare says So that my revenge if they perish in the flames I shall light up will be complete as to them  LETTER CIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday Aug    LIttle as I have reason to expect either your patient ear or forgiving heart yet cannot I forbear to write to you once more as a more pardonable intrusion per∣haps than a visit would be to beg of you to put it in my power to atone as far as it is possible to atone for the injuries I have done you  Your angelic purity and my awaken'd conscience are standing records of your exalted merit and of my detest∣able baseness But your forgiveness will lay me under an eternal obligation to youForgive me then my dearest life my earthly good the visible anchor of my future hope As you who believe you have something to be for∣given for hope for pardon yourself forgive me and con∣sent to meet me upon your own conditions and in whose company you please at the holy altar and to give your∣self a title to the most repentant and affectionate heart that ever beat in a human bosom  But perhaps a time of probation may be required It may be impossible for you as well from indisposition as doubt so soon to receive me to absolute favour as my heart wishes to be received In this case I will submit to your pleasure and there shall be no penance which you can impose that I will not chearfully undergo if you will be pleased to give me hope that after an expiation sup∣pose of months wherein the regularity of my future life and actions shall convince you of my reformation you will at last be mine  Let me beg the favour then of a few lines encouraging me in this  conditional  hope if it must not be a still  nearer  hope and a more generous encouragement  If you refuse me This you will make me desperate  But even then I must at all events throw myself at your feet that I may not charge myself with the omission of any earnest any humble effort to move you in my favour For in YOU Madam in YOUR  forgiveness  are centred my hopes as to  both worlds  Since to be reprobated finally by  You  will leave me without expectation of mercy from  Above  For I am now awaken'd enough to think that to be forgiven by injured innocents is  necessary  to the Di∣vine pardon the Almighty putting into the power of such as is reasonable to believe the wretch who causelesly and capitally offends them And  who  can be intitled to this power if YOU are not  Your cause Madam in a word I look upon to be the  cause of virtue  and as such the  cause of God  And may I not expect that He will assert it in the perdition of a man who has acted by a person of the most spotless purity as I have done if  you  by rejecting me shew that I have offended beyond the possibility of forgiveness  I do most solemnly assure you that no temporal or worldly views induce me to this earnest address I deserve not forgiveness from  you  Nor do my Lord M and his sisters from  me  I despise them from my heart for pre∣suming to imagine that I will be controuled by the pro∣spect of any benefits in their power to confer There is not a person breathing but yourself who shall prescribe to me Your whole conduct Madam has been so nobly principled and your resentments are so admirably just that you appear to me even in a divine light and in an infinitely more amiable one at the same time than you could have appeared in had you not suffered the barbarous wrongs that now fill my mind with anguish and horror at my own recollected villainy to the most excellent of women  I  repeat  that all I beg for the present is a few lines to guide my doubtful steps and if possible for you so far to condescend to encourage me to hope that if I can justify my present vows by my future conduct I may be per∣mitted the honour to style myself  Eternally Yours  R LOVELACE  LETTER CV Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Lord  M  and to the Ladies of his House In Reply to Miss Montague's of Monday Aug    p      Tuesday Aug    EXcuse me my good Lord and my everhonoured La∣dies from accepting of your noble quarterly bounty and allow me to return with all grateful acknowlegement and true humility the inclosed earnest of your goodness to me Indeed I have no need of the one and cannot pos∣sibly want the other But nevertheless have such a sense of your generous favour that to my last hour I shall have pleasure in contemplating upon it and be proud of the place I hold in the esteem of such venerable personages to whom I once had the ambition to hope to be related  But give me leave to express my concern that you have banished your kinsman from your presence and favour Since now perhaps he will be under less restraint than ever and since I in particular who had hoped by your influences to remain unmolested for the remainder of my days may be again subjected to his persecutions  He has not my good Lord and my dear Ladies offend∣ed against  you  as he has against  me  and yet you could all very generously intercede for him with  me  And shall I be  very  improper if I desire for my own peacesake for the sake of other poor creatures who may be still injured by him if he be made quite desperate and for the sake of all your worthy family that you will extend to  him  that forgiveness which you hoped for from  me  and this the rather as I presume to think that his daring and impetuous spirit will not be subdued by violent methods since I have no doubt that the gratifying of a present passion will be always more prevalent with him than any future prospects however unwarrantable the one or be∣neficial the other  Your resentments on my account are extremely gene∣rous as your goodness to me is truly noble But I am not without hope that he will be properly affected by the evils he has made me suffer and that when I am laid low and forgotten your whole honourable family will be enabled  to rejoice in his reformation and see many of those happy years together which my good Lord and my dear Ladies you so kindly wish to  Your evergrateful and obliged  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CVI  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday night Aug    YOU have been informed by Tourville how much Belton's illness and affairs have engaged  me  as well as Mowbray and him since my former I called at Smith's on Monday in my way to Epsom  The lady was gone to chapel But I had the satisfaction to hear she was not worse and left my compliments and an intimation that I should be out of town for three or four days  I refer myself to Tourville who will let you know the difficulty we had to drive out this  meek  mistress and  frugal  manager with her cubs and to give the poor fellow's sister possession for him of his own house he skulking mean while at an inn at Croydon too dispirited to appear in his own cause  But I must observe that we were probably but just in time to save the shatter'd remains of his fortune from this rapacious woman and her accomplices For as he cannot live long and she thinks so we found she had certainly taken measures to set up a marriage and keep possession of all for herself and her sons  Tourville will tell you how I was forced to chastise the quondam hostler in her sight before I could drive him out of the house He had the insolence to lay hands on me And I made him take but one step from the top to the bottom of a pair of stairs I thought his neck and all his bones had been broken And then he being carried out neckandheels Thomasine thought fit to walk out after him  Charming consequences of  keeping  the state we have been so fond of extollingWhatever it may be in strong health  sickness  and  declining spirits  in the keeper will let him see the difference  She should soon have him she told a confident in the space of six foot by five meaning his bed And then she would let nobody come near him but whom she pleased The hostlerfellow I suppose would then have been his physician his will ready made for him and widowsweeds probably ready provided who knows but to ap∣pear in them in his ownsight as once I knew an instance in a wicked wife insulting a husband she hated when she thought him past recovery Tho' it gave the man such spirits and such a turn that he got over it and lived to see her in her coffin dress'd out in the very weeds she had insulted him in  So much for the present for Belton and his Thomasine  I BEGIN to pity thee heartily now I see thee in earnest in the fruitless love thou expressest to this angel of a lady and the rather as say what thou wilt it is impossible she should get over her illness and her friends implacableness of which she has had fresh instances  I hope thou art not indeed displeased with the extracts I have made from thy letters for her The letting her know the justice thou hast done to her virtue in them is so much in favour of thy ingenuity that I think in my heart I was right tho' to any other woman and to one who had not known the worst of thee that she could know it might have been wrong  If the end will justify the means it is plain that I have done well with regard to you both since I have made  her  easier and  you  appear in a better light to her than other∣wise you would have done  But if nevertheless you are dissatisfied with my having obliged her in a point which I acknowlege to be delicate let us canvas this matter at our first meeting And then I will shew you what the extracts  were  and what connexions I gave them in your favour  But surely thou dost not pretend to say what I shall or shall not do as to the executorship  I am my own man I hope I think thou shouldst be glad to have the justification of her memory left to one who at the same time thou mayst be assured will treat thee and thy actions with all the lenity the case will admit  I cannot help expressing my surprize at one instance of thy selfpartiality and that is where thou sayst She had need indeed to cry out for mercy herself from her friends who knows not how to shew any  Surely thou canst not think the cases alikeFor she as I understand desires but a last blessing and a last for∣giveness for a fault in a manner  involuntary  if a fault at all and  hopes  not to be  received  Thou to be forgiven  premeditated  wrongs which nevertheless she forgives on condition to be no more molested by thee and hopest to be  received into favour  and to make the finest jewel in the world thy absolute property in consequence of that for∣giveness  I will now briefly proceed to relate what has passed since my last as to the poor lady by which thou wilt see she has troubles enough upon her all springing originally from thee without thy needing to add more to them by new vexations And as long as thou canst exert thyself so very cavalierly at M Hall where everyone is thy pri∣soner I see not but the bravery of thy spirit may be as well gratified in domineering there over half a dozen per∣sons of rank and distinction as it could be over a helpless orphan as I may call this lady since she has not a single friend to stand by her if I do not and who will think herself happy if she can refuge herself from thee and from all the world in the arms of death  My last was dated on Saturday  On Sunday in compliance with her doctor's advice she took a little airing Mrs Lovick and Mr Smith and his wife were with her After being at Highgate chapel at divine service she treated them with a little repast and in the afternoon was at Islington church in her way home returning tolerably chearful  She had received several letters in my absence as Mrs Lovick acquainted me besides yours Yours it seems much distressed her but she ordered the messenger who pressed for an answer to be told that it did not require an immediate one  On Wednesday she received a letter from her uncle Harlowe  See Letter  cix  p    in answer to one she had written to her  mother on Saturday on her knees It must be a very cruel one Mrs Lovick says by the effects it had upon her For when she received it she was intending to take an afternoon airing in a coach but was thrown into so vio∣lent a fit of hysterics upon it that she was forced to lie down and being not recovered thereby to go to bed about eight o'clock  On Thursday morning she was up very early and had recourse to the Scriptures to calm her mind as she told Mrs Lovick And weak as she was would go in a chair to Lincoln'sinn chapel about eleven She was brought home a little better and then sat down to write to her uncle But was obliged to leave off several timesTo struggle as she told Mrs Lovick for an humble temper  My heart said she to the good woman is a proud heart and not yet I find enough mortified to my condition but do what I can will be for prescribing resenting things to my pen  I arrived in town from Belton's this Thursday evening and went directly to Smith's She was too ill to receive my visit But on sending up my compliments she sent me down word that she should be glad to see me in the morning  Mrs Lovick obliged me with the copy of a meditation collected by the lady from the Scriptures She has intitled it  Poor mortals the cause of their own misery  so intitled I presume with intention to take off the edge of her repine∣ings at hardships so disproportioned to her fault were her fault even as great as she is inclined to think it We may see by this the method she takes to fortify her mind and to which she owes in a great measure the magnanimity with which she bears her undeserved persecutions  MEDITATION  Poor mortals the cause of their own misery  SAY not thou It is thro' the Lord that I fell away for thou oughtest not to do the thing that he hateth  Say not thou He hath caused me to err for he hath no need of the sinful man  He himself made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel  If thou wilt to keep the commandments and to perform acceptable faithfulness  He hath set fire and water before thee Stretch forth thine hand to whether thou wilt  He hath commanded no man to do wickedly neither hath he given any man licence to sin  And now Lord what is my hope Truly my hope is  only  in thee  Deliver me from all my offences and make me not a re∣buke unto the foolish  When thou with rebuke dost chasten man for sin thou makest his beauty to consume away like as it were a moth fretting a garment Every man therefore is vanity  Turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for I am de∣solate and afflicted  The troubles of my heart are inlarged O bring thou me out of my distresses  MRS Smith gave me the following particulars of a conversation that passed between herself and a young clergyman on Tuesday afternoon who as it appears was employed to make inquiries about the lady by her friends  He came into the shop in a ridinghabit and asked for some Spanish snuff and finding only herself there he de∣sired to have a little talk with her in the backshop  He beat about the bush in several distant questions and at last began to talk more directly about Miss Harlowe  He said He knew her before her  fall  That was his im∣pudent word and gave the substance of the following account of her as I collected it from Mrs Smith  She was then he said the admiration and delight of everybody He lamented with great solemnity her  backsliding  another of his phrases Mrs Smith said He was a fine scholar for he spoke several things she understood not and either in Latin or Greek she could not tell which but was so good as to give her the Eng∣lish of them without asking A fine thing she said for a scholar to be so condescending  He said  Her going off with so vile a rake had given great scandal and offence to all the neighbouring ladies as well as to her friends  He told Mrs Smith  how much she used to be followed by everyone's eye whenever she went abroad or to church and praised and blessed by every tongue as she passed especially by the poor That she gave the fashion to the fashionable without seeming herself to intend it or to know she did That however it was pleasant to see ladies imitate her in dress and behaviour who being un∣able to come up to her in grace and ease exposed but their own affectation and aukwardness at the time that they thought themselves secure of a general approbation be∣cause they wore the same things and put them on in the same manner that  she  did who had everybody's ad∣miration little considering that were  her  person like  theirs  or if she had had  their  defects she would have brought up a very different fashion for that  nature  was her guide in everything and  ease  her study which joined with a mingled dignity and condescension in her air and manner whether she received or paid a compli∣ment distinguished her above all her Sex  He spoke not he said his own sentiments only on this occasion but those of everybody For that the praises of Miss Clarissa Harlowe were such a favourite topic that a person who could not speak well upon any other subject was sure to speak well upon That be∣cause he could say nothing but what he had heard re∣peated and applauded twenty times over  Hence it was perhaps that this gentleman accounted for the best things that he said himself tho' I must own that the personal knowlege of the lady which I am favoured with made it easy to me to lick into shape what the good woman reported to me as the character given her by the young Levite For who even now in her decline of health sees not that all these attributes belong to her  I suppose he has not been long come from college and now thinks he has nothing to do but to blaze away for a scholar among the  ignorant  as such young fellows are apt to think those who cannot cap verses with them and tell us how an antient author expressed himself in Latin on a point which however they may know how as well as that author to express in English  Mrs Smith was so taken with him that she would fain  have introduced him to the lady not questioning but it would be very acceptable to her to see one who knew her and her friends so well But this he declined for several reasons which he gave One was that persons of his cloth should be very cautious of the  company they were in  especially where  Sex  was concerned and where a lady had  slurred her reputation  I wish I had been there when he gave himself these airs Another that he was desired to inform himself of her present way of life and who her visiters were for as to the praises Mrs Smith gave the lady he hinted that  she  seemed to be a goodnatured wo∣man and might tho' for the lady's sake he hoped not be too partial and shortsighted to be trusted to absolutely in a concern of so high a nature as he intimated the task was which he had undertaken nodding out words of doubtful import and assuming airs of great significance as I could gather throughout the whole conversation And when Mrs Smith told him that the lady was in a very bad state of health he gave a careless shrugShe may be very ill says he Her disappointments must have touch'd her to the quick But she is not bad enough I dare say yet to atone for her very great lapse and to expect to be for∣given by those whom she has so much disgraced  A starch'd conceited novice What would I give he had fallen in my way  He went away highly satisfied with himself no doubt and assured of Mrs Smith's great opinion of his sagacity and learning But bid her not say anything to the lady about him or his inquiries And I for very different reasons injoined the same thing  I am glad however for her peace of mind's sake that they begin to think it behoves them to inquire about her  LETTER CVII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday Aug    MR Belford acquaints his friend with the generosity of Lord M and the Ladies of his family and with the lady's grateful sentiments' upon the occasion  He says that in hopes to avoid the pain of seeing him she in∣tends to answer his letter of the th tho' much against her inclination  She took great notice  says Mr Belford  of  that passage in yours which makes necessary to the  Divine  pardon the forgiveness of a person causelesly injured  Her grandfather I find has enabled her at eighteen years of age to make her will and to devise great part of his estate to whom she pleases of the family and the rest out of it if she die single at her own discretion and this to create respect to her as he ap∣prehended that she would be envied And she now resolves to set about making her will out of hand  Mr Belford insists upon the promise he had made him not to molest the lady And gives him the contents of her answer to Lord M and the Ladies declining their generous offers  See Letter CV  p    LETTER CVIII  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  ROB LOVELACE  Esq  Friday Aug    'TIS a cruel alternative to be either forced to see you or to write to you But a will of my own has been long denied me and to avoid a greater evil nay now I may say the greatest I write  Were I capable of disguising or concealing my real sen∣timents I might safely I dare say give you the remote hope you request and yet keep all my resolutions But I must tell you Sir it becomes my character to tell you that were I to live more years than perhaps I may weeks and there were not another man in the world I could not I would not be yours  There is no  merit  in performing a  duty  Religion injoins me not only to forgive injuries but to return good for evil It is all my consolation and I bless God for giving me That that I am now in such a state of mind with regard to you that I can chearfully obey its dictates And accordingly I tell you that where∣ever you go I wish you happy And in This I mean to include every good wish  And now having with great reluctance I own com∣plied with one of your compulsatory alternatives I expect the fruits of it  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CIX  Mr  JOHN HARLOWE  To Miss  CL HARLOWE  In answer to hers to her Mother See p    Monday Aug    Poor ungrateful naughty Kinswoman  YOUR mother neither caring nor being  permitted  to write I am desired to set pen to paper tho' I had resolved against it  And so I am to tell you that your letters joined to the occasion of them almost break the hearts of us all  Were we sure you had seen your folly and were  truly  penitent and at the same time that you were so very ill as you intimate I know not what might be done for you But we are all acquainted with your moving ways when you want to carry a point  Unhappy girl how miserable have you made us all We who used to visit with so much pleasure now cannot endure to look upon one another  If you had not known upon an hundred occasions how dear you once was to us you might judge of it now were you to know how much your folly has unhing'd us all  Naughty naughty girl You see the fruits of prefer∣ring a rake and libertine to a man of sobriety and morals Against full warning against better knowlege And such a modest creature too as you was How could you think of such an unworthy preference  Your mother  can't  ask and your sister knows not in modesty  how  to ask and so  I  ask you If you have any reason to think yourself with child by this villainYou  must  answer this and answer it truly before any thing can be resolved upon about you  You may well be touched with a deep remorse for your misdeeds Could I ever have thought that my doatingpiece as everyone called you would have done thus To be sure I loved you too well But that is over now Yet tho' I will not pretend to answer for anybody but myself for my own part I say God forgive you And this is all from  Your afflicted Uncle  JOHN HARLOWE  The following  MEDITATION  was stitch'd to the bottom of this Letter with black silk  MEDITATION  O That thou wouldst hide me in the grave That thou wouldst keep me secret till thy wrath be past  My face is foul with weeping and on my eyelid is the shadow of death  My friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto God  A dreadful sound is in my ears in prosperity the destroyer came upon me  I have sinned What shall I do unto thee thou Pre∣server of men Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that I am a burden to myself  When I say My bed shall comfort me My couch shall ease my complaint  Then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me thro' visions  So that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than life  I loath it I would not live alwayLet me alone for my days are vanity  He hath made me a byword of the people and aforetime I was as a tabret  My days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart  When I looked for good then evil came unto me and when I waited for light then came darkness  And where now is my hope  Yet all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come  LETTER CX  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  JOHN HARLOWE  Esq  Thursday Aug    Honoured Sir  IT was an act of charity I begged Only for a last bless∣ing that I might die in peace I ask not to be re∣ceived again as my severe sister Oh that I had not writ∣ten  to her is pleased to say is my view Let that grace be denied me when I do  I could not look forward to my last scene with comfort without seeking at least to obtain the blessing I petitioned for and that with a contrition so deep that I deserved not were it known to be turned over from the tender nature of a mother to the upbraiding pen of an uncle and to be wounded by a cruel question put by him in a shocking manner and which a little a very little time will better answer than I can For I am not either a harden'd or shame∣less creature If I were I should not have been so solici∣tous to obtain the favour I sued for  And permit me to say that I asked it as well for my father and mother's sake as for my own for I am sure  They  at least will be uneasy after I am gone that they refused it to me  I should still be glad to have theirs and yours Sir and all your blessings and your prayers But denied in such a manner I will not presume again to ask it Relying intirely on the Almighty's which is never denied when supplicated for with such true penitence as I hope mine is  God preserve my dear uncle and all my honoured friends prays  Your unhappy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CXI  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Yarmouth Isle of Wight Monday Aug    My dearest creature  I Can write just now but a few lines I cannot tell how to bear the  sound  of that Mr Belford for your Execu∣tor cogent as your reasons for that measure are And yet I am firmly of opinion that none of your relations should be named for the trust But I dwell the less upon this subject as I hope and cannot bear to apprehend the contrary that you will still live many many years  Mr Hickman indeed speaks very handsomely of Mr Belford But he poor man has not much penetration If he had he would hardly think so well of  me  as he does  I have a particular opportunity of sending this by a friend of my aunt Harman's who is ready to set out for London and this occasions my hurry and is to return out of hand I expect therefore by him a large pacquet from you and hope and long for news of your amended health Which Heaven grant to the prayers of  Your everaffectionate  ANNA HOWE  LETTER CXII  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE  Friday Aug    I Will send you a large pacquet as you desire and ex∣pect since I can do it by so safe a conveyance But not all that is come to my handFor I must own that my friends are very severe too severe for anybody who loves them not to see their letters You my dear would not call them my  friends  you said long ago but my  re∣lations  Indeed I cannot call them my  relations  I thinkBut I am ill and therefore perhaps more peevish than I should be It is difficult to go out of ourselves to give a judgment against ourselves and yet oftentimes to pass a  just  judgment we ought  I thought I should alarm you in the choice of my Exe∣cutor But the sad necessity I am reduced to must excuse me  I shall not repeat anything I have said before on that subject But if your objections will not be answered to your satisfaction by the papers and letters I shall inclose marked to I must think myself in another instance unhappy since I am engaged too far and with my own judgment too to recede  As I have the accompanying transcripts from Mr Bel∣ford in confidence from his friend's letters to him I must insist that you suffer no soul but yourself to peruse them and that you return them by the very first opportunity that so no use may be made of them that may do hurt ei∣ther to the original writer or to the communicator You'll observe I am bound by promise to this care If thro'  my  means any mischief should arise between this  humane  and that  inhuman  libertine I should think myself utterly in∣excusable  I subjoin a list of the papers or letters I shall inclose You must return them all when perused  A Letter from Miss Montague dated Aug  A copy of my answer Aug  Mr Belford's letter to me which will shew you what my request was to him and his compli∣ance with it and the desired extracts from his friend's letters Aug  A copy of my answer with thanks and request∣ing him to undertake the Executorship Aug  Mr Belford's acceptance of the trust Aug  Miss Montague's letter with a generous offer from Lord M and the Ladies of that family Aug  Mr Lovelace's to me Aug  Copy of mine to Miss Montague in answer to hers of the day before Aug  Copy of my answer to Mr

opportunity or leisure I can have for writing my own story    I am very much tired and fatigued with I don't know whatwith writing I thinkBut most with myself and with a situation I cannot help aspiring to get out of and above  O my dear 'tis a sad a very sad worldWhile under our parents protecting wings we know nothing at all of it Booklearned and a scribbler and looking at people as I saw

your uncle Harlowe chooses not to answer your pert letter to him and as mine written to you be∣fore  Vol  I  p    was written as if it were in the spirit of prophecy as you have found to your sorrow and as you are now making yourself worse than you are in your health and better than you are in your penitence  as we are very well assured  in order to move compassion which you do not deserve having had so much warning For all these rea∣sons I take up my pen once more tho' I had told your  brother at his going to Edinburgh  that I would not write to you even were you to write to me without letting him know So indeed  had we all  for he prognosticated what would happen as to your applying to us when you knew not how to help it  Brother John has hurt your niceness it seems by ask∣ing you a plain question which your mother's heart is too full of grief to let her ask and modesty will not let your sister ask tho' but the consequence of your actionsAnd yet it  must  be answered before you'll obtain from your father and mother and us the notice you hope for I can tell you that  You lived several guilty weeks with one of the vilest fellows that ever drew breath at bed as well as board no doubt for is not his character known and pray don't be ashamed to be asked after what may naturally come of such free living This modesty indeed would have be∣come you for eighteen years of your lifeYou'll be plea∣sed to mark that but makes no good figure compared with your behaviour since the beginning of April last So pray don't take it up and wipe your mouth upon it as if nothing had happened  But may be I likewise am too shocking to your nice∣nessOh girl girl your modesty had better been shewn at the right time and place Everybody but you be∣lieved what the Rake was But you would believe nothing bad of himWhat think you now  Your folly has ruined all our peace And who knows where it may yet end Your poor father but yesterday shewed me this text With bitter grief he shewed it me poor man And do you lay it to your heart  A father waketh for his daughter when no man knoweth and the care for her taketh away his sleep  When she is young lest she pass away the flower of her age  and you know what proposals were made to you at different times  And being married lest she should be hated In her virginity lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house  I don't make the words mind that  And having an husband lest she should misbehave herself  And what follows  Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter  yet no watch could hold you  lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies  as you have made us all to this cursed Love∣lace  and a byeword in the city and a reproach among the people and make thee ashamed before the multi∣tude  Ecclus  xlii  c  Now will you wish you had not written pertly Your sister's severitiesNever girl say that is  severe  that is  deserved  You know the meaning of words Nobody better Would to the Lord you had acted up but to one half of what you know Then had we not been dis∣appointed and grieved as we all have been And nobody more than him who was  Your loving Uncle  ANTONY HARLOWE  This will be with you tomorrow Perhaps you may be suffered to have some part of your estate after you have smarted a little more Your pertlyanswered uncle John who is your trustee will not have you be destitute But we hope all is not true  that we hear of you  Only take care I advise you that bad as you have acted you act not still worse if it be possible to act worse  Improve upon the hint  LETTER CXIV  Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  ANT HARLOWE  Esq  Sunday Aug    Honoured Sir  I AM very sorry for my pert letter to my uncle Har∣lowe Yet I did not intend it to be pert People  new  to misfortune may be too easily moved to impatience  The fall of a regular person no doubt is dreadful and inexcusable It is like the sin of apostasy Would to Hea∣ven  however that I had had the circumstances of mine inquired into  If Sir I make myself worse than I am in my health and better than I am in my penitence it is fit I should be punished for my double dissimulation And  you  have the pleasure of being one of my punishers My sincerity in both respects will however be best justified by the event To  that  I referMay Heaven give you always as much comfort in reflecting upon the reprobation I have met with as you seem to have pleasure in mortifying a poor creature  extremely  mortified and that from a  right  sense as she presumes to hope of her own fault  What you have  heard of me  I cannot tell When the nearest and dearest relations give up an unhappy wretch it is not to be wondered at that those who are  not  related to her are ready to take up and propagate slanders against her Yet I think I may defy calumny itself and ex∣cepting the fatal tho' involuntary step of  April  wrap myself in my own innocence and be easy I thank you Sir nevertheless for your  caution  mean it what it will  As to the question required of me to answer and which is allowed to be too shocking either for a mother to put to a daughter or a sister to a sister and which however  you  say I  must  answerO SirAnd  must  I answerThis then be my answer  A  little  time a much  less  time than is imagined will afford a more satisfactory answer to my whole family and even to my  brother  and  sister  than I can give in words  Nevertheless be pleased to let it be remembred that I did not petition for a restoration to favour I could not hope for that Nor yet to be put in possession of any part of my own estate Nor even for means of necessary subsist∣ence from the produce of that estateBut only for a bless∣ing for a  last  blessing  And this I will further add because it is  true  that I have no wilful crime to charge against myself No free living at bed and at board as you phrase it  Why why Sir were not other inquiries made of me as well as this shocking oneInquiries that modesty  would  have permitted a mother or a sister to make and which if I  may be excused to say so would have been still  l  ss  impro∣per and  more  charitable to have been made by  uncles  were the mother  forbid  or the sister  not inclined  to make them than those they have made  Altho' my humble application has brought upon me so much severe reproach I repent not that I have written to my mamma altho' I cannot but wish that I had not written to my sister because I have satisfied a dutiful consciousness by it however unanswered by the wishedfor success Ne∣vertheless I cannot help saying that mine is indeed a hard fate that I cannot beg pardon for my capital error without doing it in such terms as shall be an aggravation of the offence  But I had best leave off lest as my full mind I find is rising to my pen I have other pardons to beg as I mul∣tiply lines where none at all will be given  God Almighty bless preserve and comfort my dear sorrowing and grievously offended father and motherAnd continue in honour favour and merit my happy sister May God forgive my brother and protect him from the violence of his own temper as well as from the destroyer of his sister's honourAnd may you my dear uncle and your no less now than ever dear brother my second papa as he used to bid me call him be blessed and happy in them all and in each otherAnd in order to this may you all speedily banish from your remembrance for ever  The unhappy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CXV  Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Monday Aug    ALL your friends here my dear young Lady now seem set upon proposing to you to go to one of the Plantations This I believe is owing to some misrepre∣sentations of Mr Brand from whom they have received a letter  I wish with all my heart that you could consistently with your own notions of honour yield to the pressing requests of all Mr Lovelace's family in his behalf This  I think would stop every mouth and in time recon∣cile everybody to you For your own friends will not believe that he is in earnest to marry you and the hatred between the families is such that they will not condescend to inform themselves better nor would believe  him  if he were ever so solemnly to avow that he is  I should be very glad to have in readiness upon occa∣sion some brief particulars of your sad story under your own hand But let me tell you at the same time that no misrepresentations nor even your own confession shall lessen my opinion either of your piety or of your pru∣dence in essential points because I know it was always your humble way to make light faults heavy against your∣self And well might you my dearest young Lady ag∣gravate your own failings who have ever had so few and those few so slight that your ingenuity has turned most of them into excellencies  Nevertheless let me advise you my dear Miss Clary to discountenance any visits that may with the censo∣rious affect your character As  that  has not hitherto suf∣fered by your  wilful  default I hope you will not in a desponding negligence satisfying yourself with a consci∣ousness of your own innocence permit it to suffer Dif∣ficult situations you know my dear young Lady are the tests not only of prudence but of virtue  I think I must own to you that since Mr Brand's letter has been received I have a renewed prohibition to attend you However if you will give me leave that shall not detain me from you Nor would I stay for that leave if I were not in hopes that in this critical situa∣tion I may be able to do you service here  I have often had messages and inquiries after your health from the truly reverend Dr Lewen who has always ex∣pressed and still expresses infinite concern for you He intirely disapproves of the measures of the family with regard to you He is too much indisposed to go abroad But were he in good health he would not as I under∣stand visit at HarlowePlace having been unhandsomely treated some time ago by your brother on his offering to mediate between your family and you  I AM just now informed that your cousin Morden is arrived in England He is at Canterbury it seems look∣ing after some concerns he has there and is soon expected in these parts Who knows what may arise from his ar∣rivalGod be with you my dearest Miss Clary and be your Comforter and Sustainer And never fear but he will for I am sure I am very sure that you put your whole trust in Him  And what after all is this world on which we so much depend for durable good poor creatures that we areWhen all the joys of it and what is a balancing com∣fort all the  troubles  of it are but momentary and vanish like a morning dream  And be this remembred my dearest young Lady that worldly joy claims no kindred with the joys we are bid to aspire after These latter we must be fitted for by afflic∣tion and disappointment You are therefore in the direct road to glory however thorny the path you are in And I had almost said that it depends upon yourself by your patience and by your resignedness to the dispensation God enabling you who never fails the true penitent and sincere invoker to be an heir of a blessed immortality  But this glory I humbly pray that you may not be permitted to enter into ripe as you are so soon likely to be for it till with your gentle hand a pleasure I have so often as you know promised to myself you have closed the eyes of  Your maternallyaffectionate  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER CXVI  Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON  Thursday Aug    WHAT Mr Brand or anybody can have written or said to my prejudice I cannot imagine and yet some evil reports have gone out against me as I find by some hints in a very severe letter written to me by my uncle Antony Such a letter as I believe was never written to any poor creature who by ill health of body as well as of mind was before tottering on the brink of the grave  But my friends may possibly be better justified than the re∣portersFor who knows what they may have heard  You give me a kind caution which seems to imply  more  than you express when you advise me against coun∣tenancing of visitors that may discredit me You should in so tender a point my dear Mrs Norton have spoken quite out Surely I have had afflictions enow to make my mind fitted to bear anything But I will not puzzle myself by  conjectural evils  I  might  if I had not enow that were  certain  And I shall hear all when it is thought proper that I should Mean time let me say for  your  satisfaction that I know not that I have anything crimi∣nal or disreputable to answer for either in word or deed since the fatal th of April last  You desire an account of what passes between me and my friends and also particulars or brief heads of my sad story in order to serve me as occasions shall offer My dear good Mrs Norton you shall have a whole pacquet of papers which I have sent to my Miss Howe when she returns them and you shall have besides another pacquet and that with this letter which I cannot at pre∣sent think of sending to that dear friend for the sake of my  own relations  whom she is already but too eager to cen∣sure heavily From these you will be able to collect a great deal of my story But for what is previous to these papers and which more particularly relates to what I have suffered from Mr Lovelace you must have patience for at present I have neither head nor heart for such subjects The papers I send you with this will be those mentioned in the margin  A copy of mine to my sister begging off my father's maledi∣ction dated July  My sister's answer dated July  Copy of my second letter to my sister dated July  My sister's answer dated Aug  Copy of my letter to my mother dated Aug  My uncle Harlowe's letter dated Aug  C  py of my answer to it dated the th  Letter from my uncle Antony dated the th  And lastly the copy of my answer to it dated the th  You must restore them to me as soon as perused and upon your honour make no use of any intelligence you have from me but by my consent  These communications you must not my good Mrs  Norton look upon as appeals against my relations On the contrary I am heartily sorry that they have incurred the displeasure of so excellent a divine as Dr Lewen But you desire to have everything before you and I think you  ought  for who knows as you say but you may be applied to at last to administer comfort from their con∣ceding hearts to one that wants it and who sometimes judging by what she knows of her own heart thinks her∣self intitled to it  I know that I have a most indulgent and sweettem∣pered mother but having to deal with violent spirits she has too often forfeited that peace of mind which she so much prefers by her overconcern to preserve it  I am sure she would not have turned me over for an an∣swer to a letter written with so contrite and fervent a spirit as was mine to her to a  manly  spirit had she been left to herself  But my dear Mrs Norton might not think you the revered lady have favoured me with one  private  lineIf not might not she have permitted  you  to have written by her order or connivance one softening one  motherly  line when she saw her poor girl borne so hard upon  O no she might notBecause her heart to be sure is in their measuresAnd if  she  think them right perhaps they  must be right  At least knowing only what  they  knowAnd yet they  might  know all if they would And possibly in their own good time they think to make proper inquiry My application was made to them but  lately  Yet how grievous will it be to their hearts if  their  time should be  out of time  By the letters I have sent to Miss Howe you will see when you have them before you that Lord M and the Ladies of his family jealous as they are of the honour of  their house  to express myself in their language think bet∣ter of me than my own relations do You will see an in∣stance of their generosity to me which has extremely af∣fected me  Some of the letters in the same pacquet will also let you into the knowlege of a strange step which I have taken strange you will think it and at the same time give you my reasons for it  She means that of making Mr Belford her Executor    It must be expected that situations uncommonly difficult will make necessary some extraordinary steps which but for those situations would be hardly excuseable It will be very happy indeed and somewhat wonderful if all the measures I have been driven to take should be right A pure intention void of all undutiful resentment is what must be my consolation whatever others may think of those measures when they come to know them Which however will hardly be till it is out of my power to justify them or to answer for myself  I am glad to hear of my cousin Morden's safe arrival I should wish to see him methinks But I am afraid that he will sail with the stream as it must be expected that he will hear what they have to say firstBut what I most fear is that he will take upon himself to avenge meRather than this should happen I would have him look upon me as a creature utterly unworthy of his concern at least of his  vindictive  concern  How soothing to the wounded heart of your Clarissa how balmy are the assurances of your continued love and favour Love me my dear mamma Norton continue to love me to the endI now think that I may without presumption promise to  deserve  your love to the end And when I am gone cherish my memory in your worthy heart for in so doing you will cherish the memory of one who loves and honours you more than she can express  But when I am no more get over I charge you as soon as you can the smarting pangs of grief that will attend a recent loss and let all be early turned into that sweetlymelancholy Regard to MEMORY which engaging us to forget all faults and to remember nothing but what was thought amiable gives more pleasure than pain to survi∣vors Especially if they can comfort themselves with the humble hope that the Divine mercy has taken the dear de∣parted to itself  And what is the space of time to look backward upon between an early departure and the longest survivanceAnd what the consolation attending the sweet hope of meeting again never more to be separated never more to be pained grieved or aspersed But mutually blessing and being blessed to all eternity  In the contemplation of this happy state in which I hope in God's good time to rejoice with you my beloved Mrs Norton and also with my dear relations all reconciled to and blessing the child against whom they are now so much incensed I conclude myself  Your everdutiful and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER CXVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Sunday Aug    I Don't know what a devil ails me but I never was so much indisposed in my life At first I thought some of my blessed relations here had got a dose administred to me in order to get the whole house to themselves But as I am the hopes of the family I believe they would not be so wicked  I must lay down my pen I cannot write with any spirit at all What a plague can be the matter with me  LORD M paid me just now a cursed gloomy visit to ask how I do after bleeding His sisters both drove away yesterday God be thanked But they asked not my leave and hardly bid me goodbye My Lord was more tender and more dutiful than I expected Men are less unforgiving than women I have reason to say so I am sure For besides implacable Miss Harlowe and the old Ladies the two Montague Apes han't been near me yet  NEITHER eat drink nor sleepA piteous case Jack If I should die like a fool now people would say Miss Harlowe had broke my heartThat she  vexes  me to the heart is certain  Confounded squeamish I would fain write it off But must lay down my pen again It won't do Poor Love∣laceWhat a devil ails thee  WELL but now let's try for'tHoyHoyHoy Con∣found me for a gaping puppy how I yawnWhere shall  I begin At thy ExecutorshipThou shalt have a double office of it For I really think thou mayst send me a coffin and a shroud I shall be ready for them by the time they can come down  What a little fool is this Miss Harlowe I warrant she'll now repent that she refused me Such a lovely young widowWhat a charming widow would she have made How would she have adorned the weeds To be a widow in the first twelvemonth is one of the greatest felicities that can befall a fine lady Such pretty employment in  new dismals  when she had hardly worn round her  blazing joy∣fuls  Such lights and such shades how would they set off one another and be adorned by the wearer  Go to the devilI  will  writeCan I do anything else  They would not have me write BelfordI must be ill indeed when I can't write  BUT thou seemest nettled Jack Is it because I was stung It is not for two friends any more than for man and wife to be out of patience at one time What must be the consequence if they areI am in no fighting mood just now But as patient and passive as the chickens that are brought me in brothFor I am come to that already  But I can tell thee for all this be  thy own man  if thou wilt as to the Executorship I will never suffer thee to ex∣pose my letters They are too ingenuous by half to be seen And I absolutely insist upon it that on receipt of this thou burn them all  I will never forgive thee that impudent and unfriendly reflection of my  cavaliering  it here over half a dozen per∣sons of distinction Remember too thy poor  helpless or∣phan  These reflections are too serious and thou art also too serious for me to let these things go off as jesting not∣withstanding the Roman stile is preserved and indeed but just preserved By my soul Jack if I had not been taken thus egregiously cropsick I would have been up with thee and the lady too before now  But write on however And send me copies if thou canst of all that passes between our Charlotte and Miss Harlowe I'll take no notice of what thou communicatest of that sort I like not the people here the worse for their  generous offer to the lady But you see she is as proud as implacable There's no obliging her She'd rather sell her cloaths than be beholden to anybody altho' she would oblige by permitting the obligation  Oh Lord Oh LordMortal illAdieu Jack  I WAS forced to leave off I was so ill at this place And what dost think My uncle brought the parson of the parish to pray by me for his chaplain is at Oxford I was lain down in my nightgown over my waistcoat and in a doze And when I open'd my eyes who should I see but the parson kneeling on one side the bed Lord M on the other Mrs Greme who had been sent for to  tend me  as they call it at the feet God be thanked my Lord said I in an ecstasyWhere's Miss For I thought they were going to marry me  They thought me delirious at first and pray'd louder and louder  This roused me Off the bed I started slid my feet into my slippers put my hand in my waistcoat pocket and pulled out thy letter with my Beloved's meditations in it My Lord Dr Wright Mrs Greme you have thought me a very wicked fellow But see I can read you as good as you can read me  They stared at one another I gaped and read Poor moortals the cauoause of their own their own misserry  It is as suitable to my case as to the lady's as thou'lt ob∣serve if thou readest it again  See p    At the passage where it is said That when a man is chastened for sin his beauty consumes away I stept to the glass A poor figure by Jupiter cried IAnd they all praised and admired me lifted up their hands and their eyes and the Doctor said He always thought it impossible that a man of my sense could be so wild as the world said I was My Lord chuckled for joy congratulated me and thank my dear Miss Harlowe I got high reputation among good bad and indifferent In short I have established myself for ever with all hereBut O Belford even this will not doI must leave off again  A VISIT from the Montague sisters led in by my hob∣ling uncle to congratulate my amendment and reforma∣tion both in one What a lucky event this illness with this meditation in my pocket for we were all to pieces before Thus when a boy have I joined with a croud coming out of church and have been thought to have been there myself  I am incensed at the insolence of the young Levite Thou wilt highly oblige me if thou'lt find him out and send me his ears in the next letter  My charmer mistakes me if she thinks I proposed her writing to me as an alternative that should dispense with my attendance upon her That it shall  not  do nor did I intend it should unless she had pleased me better in the contents of it than she has done Bid her read again I gave no such hopes I would have been with her in spite of you both by tomorrow at farthest had I not been laid by the heels thus like a helpless miscreant  But I grow better and better every hour  I  say The  Doctor  says not But I am sure I know best And I will soon be in London depend on't But say nothing of this to my dear cruel and implacable Miss Harlowe  Adieuu JaaackWhat a gaping puppy Yawn yawn yawn  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER CXVIII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Monday Aug    I Am extremely concerned for thy illness I should be very sorry to lose thee Yet if thou diest so soon I could wish from my soul it had been before the beginning of last April And this as well for thy sake as for the sake of the most excellent woman in the world For then thou wouldst not have had the most crying sin of thy life to an∣swer for  I was told on Saturday that thou wert very much out of order and this made me forbear writing till I heard further Harry on his return from thee confirmed the  bad way thou art in But I hope Lord M in his unmerited tenderness for thee thinks the worst of thee What can it be Bob A violent fever they say but attended with odd and severe symptoms  I will not trouble thee in the way thou art in with what passes here with Miss Harlowe I wish thy repent∣ance as swift as thy illness and as efficacious if thou diest for it is else to be feared that She and You will never meet in one place  I told her how ill you are Poor man said she  Dan∣gerously  ill say you  Dangerously  indeed  MadamSo Lord M sends me word  God be merciful to him if he die said the admirable creature Then after a pause Poor wretchMay he meet with the mercy he has not shewn  I send this by a special messenger For I am impatient to hear how it goes with theeIf I have received thy  last  letter what melancholy reflections will that  last  so full of shocking levity give to  Thy true Friend  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER CXIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Aug    THANK thee Jack most heartily I thank thee for the sober conclusion of thy last I have a good mind for the sake of it to forgive thy tillnow absolutely unpardonable extracts  But dost think I will lose such an angel such a  forgiving  angel as thisBy my soul I will notTo pray for mercy for such an ingrateful miscreantHow she wounds how she cuts me to the soul by her exalted generosityBut SHE must have mercy upon me firstThen will she teach me a reliance for the sake of which her prayer for me will be answered  But hasten hasten to me particulars of her health of her employments of her conversation  I am sick only of love O that I could have called her mineIt would then have been worth while to be  sickTo have sent for her down to me from town and to have had her with healing in her dovelike wings fly∣ing to my comfort her duty and her choice to pray for me and to bid me live for her sakeO Jack what an angel have I  But I  have not  lost herI  will not  lose her I am al∣most well should be quite well but for these prescribing rascals who to do credit to their skill will make the dis∣ease of importanceAnd I will make her mineAnd be sick again to intitle myself to her  dutiful  tenderness and  pious  as well as  personal  concern  God for ever bless herHasten hasten particulars of herI am sick of loveSuch generous goodnessBy all that's great and good I will not lose her So tell herShe says That she could not pity me if she thought of being mine This according to Miss Howe's transcriptions to Charlotte But bid her hate me and have me And my behaviour to her shall soon turn that hate to loveFor body and mind I will be wholly hers  LETTER CXX  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday Aug    I Am sincerely rejoiced to hear that thou art already so much amended as thy servant tells me thou art Thy letter looks as if thy morals were mending with thy health This was a letter I  could  shew as I  did  to the lady  She is very ill Cursed letters received from her impla∣cable family So I could not have much conversation with her in thy favour upon itBut what passed will make thee more and more adore her  She was very attentive to me as I read it and when I had done Poor man said she what a letter is this He had timely instances that my temper was not ungenerous if generosity could have obliged him But his remorse and that for  his own  sake is all the punishment I wish himYet I must be more reserved if you write to him everything I say  I extolled her unbounded goodnessHow could I help it tho' to her face  No goodness in it she saidIt was a frame of mind she had endeavoured after for her own sake She suffered too much in want of mercy not to wish it to a penitent heartHe  seems  to be penitent said she and it is not for me to judge beyond appearancesIf he be not he deceives himself more than anybody else  She was so ill that this was all that passed on the occa∣sion  What a fine subject for Tragedy would the injuries of this lady and her behaviour under them both with regard to her implacable friends and to her persecutor make With a grand objection as to the moral nevertheless  Mr Belford's objection▪ That virtue ought not to suffer in a Tragedy is not well considered Monimia in the Orphan Belvidera in Venice Preserv'd Athenais in Theodosius Cordelia in Shakespeare's King Lear Desdemona in Othello Hamlet to name no more are instances that a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy if virtue did not tempo∣rarily suffer and vice for a while triumph But he recovers himself in the same paragraph and leads us to look up to the FUTURE for the Reward of Virtue and for the Punishment of Guilt And observes not amiss when he says He knows not but that the virtue of such a wo∣man as Clarissa is rewarded in missing such a man as Lovelace  for here virtue is punished Except indeed we look for∣ward to the rewards of HEREAFTER which morally  she  must be sure of or who can Yet after all I know not so sad a fellow art thou and so vile an husband mightest thou have made whether her virtue is not rewarded in missing thee For things the most grievous to human na∣ture when they happen as this charming creature once observed are often the happiest for us in the event  I have frequently thought in my attendance on this lady That if Belton's admired author Nic Rowe had had such a character before him he would have drawn another sort of a penitent than he  has  done or given his Play which he calls  The Fair Penitent  a fitter title Miss Harlowe is a penitent indeed I think if I am not guilty of a contradiction in terms a penitent without a fault her parents conduct towards her from the first considered  The whole story of the other is a pack of damn'd stuff Lothario 'tis true seems such another wicked ungenerous varlet as thou know'st who The author knew how to draw a Rake but not to paint a Penitent Calista is a de∣siring luscious wench and her penitence is nothing else  but rage insolence and scorn Her passions are all storm and tumult nothing of the finer passions of the Sex which if naturally drawn will distinguish themselves from the masculine passions by a softness that will even mine thro' rage and despair Her character is made up of deceit and disguise She has no virtue is all pride and her devil is as much  within  her as  without  her  How then can the fall of such a one create a proper distress when all the circumstances of it are considered For does she not brazen out her crime even after detection Knowing her own guilt she calls for Altamont's vengeance on his best friend as if he had traduced her yields to marry Altamont tho' criminal with another and actually beds that whining puppy when she had given up herself body and soul to Lothario who nevertheless refused to marry her  Her penitence when begun she justly stiles  The phrensy of her soul  and as I said after having as long as she could most audaciously brazened out her crime and done all the mischief she could do occasioning the death of Lo∣thario of her father and others she stabs herself  And can this be an act of penitence  But indeed our poets hardly know how to create a di∣stress without horror and murder and must shock your soul to bring tears from your eyes  Altamont indeed who is an amorous blockhead a cre∣dulous cuckold and tho' painted as a brave fellow and a soldiera whining Tom Essence and a quarreller with his best friend dies like a fool without sword or popgun of mere grief and nonsense for one of the vilest of her sex But the  Fair Penitent  as she is called dies by her own hand and having no title by her past crimes to  laud∣able  pity forfeits all claim to  true  penitence and in all probability to future mercy  But here is MISS HARLOWE virtuous noble wise pious unhappily insnared by the vows and oaths of a vile Rake whom she believes to be a man of honour And being ill used by her friends for  his sake  is in a manner  forced  to throw herself upon his protection who in order to obtain her confidence never scruples the deepest and most solemn protestations of honour After a series of plots  and contrivances all baffled by her virtue and vigilance he basely has recourse to the vilest of arts and to rob her of her honour is forced first to rob her of her senses Un∣able to bring her notwithstanding to his ungenerous views of cohabitation she awes him in the very entrance of a fresh act of premeditated guilt in presence of the most abandoned of women assembled to assist his cursed pur∣pose triumphs over them all by virtue only of her inno∣cence and escapes from the vile hands he had put her into Nobly not franticly resents Refuses to see or to marry the wretch who repenting his usage of so divine a crea∣ture would fain move her to forgive his baseness and make him her husband And tho' persecuted by all her friends and abandoned to the deepest distress obliged from ample fortunes to make away with her apparel for subsistence surrounded by strangers and forced in want of others to make a friend of the friend of her seducer Tho' longing for death and making all the proper pre∣paratives for it convinced that grief and ill usage have broken her noble heart she abhors the impious thought of shortening her allotted period and as much a stranger to revenge as despair is able to forgive the author of her ruin wishes his repentance and that she may be the last victim to his barbarous perfidy And is solicitous for no∣thing so much in this life as to prevent vindictive mischief  to  and  from  the man who has used her so basely  This is penitence This is piety And hence a distress naturally arises that must  worthily  affect every heart  Whatever the illusage of this excellent lady is from her relations it breaks not out into excesses She strives on the contrary to find reason to justify them at her own ex∣pence and seems more concerned for their cruelty to her for their sakes hereafter when she shall be no more than for her own For as to herself she is sure she says God will forgive her tho' nobody else will  On every extraordinary provocation she has recourse to the Scriptures and endeavours to regulate her vehemence by sacred precedents Better people she says have been more afflicted than she grievous as she sometimes thinks her afflictions And shall she not bear what less faulty persons have born On the very occasion I have men∣tioned  some new instances of implacableness from her friends the inclosed meditation will shew how mildly she complains and yet how forcibly See if thou in the wicked levity of thy heart canst apply it as thou didst the other to thy case If thou canst not give way to thy conscience and That will make the properest application  MEDITATION  HOW long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words  Be it indeed that I have erred mine error remaineth with myself  To  her  that is afflicted pity should be shewn from her friend  But she  that is ready to slip with  her  feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of  them  that  are  at ease  There is a shame which bringeth sin and there is a shame which bringeth glory and grace  Have pity upon me have pity upon me O ye my friends for the hand of God hath touched me  If your soul were in my soul's stead I also could speak as ye do I could heap up words against you  But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the move∣ing of my lips should assuage your grief  Why will ye  break a leaf driven to and fro  Why will ye  pursue the dry stubble  Why will ye  write bitter words against me and make me possess the iniquities of my youth  Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction as clouds of rain in the time of drought  Are not my days few Cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a littleBefore I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and shadow of death  POSTSCRIPT  THIS excellent lady is informed by a letter from Mrs Norton that Colonel Morden is just arrived in England He is now the only person she wishes to see  I expressed some jealousy upon it lest he should have place given over me in the Executorship She said That she had no thoughts to do so now for that such a trust were he to accept of it which she doubted might from the nature of some of the papers which in that case would necessarily pass through his hands occasion mis∣chiefs between my friend and him that would be worse than death for her to think of  Poor Belton I hear is at death's door A messenger is just come from him who tells me He cannot die till he sees me I hope the poor fellow will not go off yet since neither his affairs in this world nor for the other are in tolerable order I cannot avoid going to the poor man Yet am unwilling to stir till I have an assurance from thee that thou wilt not disturb the lady For I know he will be very loth to part with me when he gets me to him  Tourville tells me how fast thou mendest Let me conjure thee not to think of molesting this incomparable woman For thy own sake I request this as well as for hers and for the sake of thy given promise For should she die within a few weeks as I fear she will it will be said and perhaps too justly that thy visit has hastened her end  In hopes thou wilt not I wish thy perfect recovery Else that thou mayst relapse and be confined to thy bed  LETTER CXXI  Mr  BELFORD  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Sat morn Aug    Madam  I Think myself obliged in honour to acquaint you that I am afraid Mr Lovelace will try his fate by an inter∣view with you  I wish to Heaven you could prevail upon yourself to re∣ceive his visit All that is respectful even to veneration and all that is penitent will you see in his behaviour if you can admit of it But as I am obliged to set out di∣rectly for Epsom to perform as I apprehend the last friendly offices for poor Mr Belton whom once you saw and as I think it more likely that Mr Lovelace will  not  be prevailed upon than that he  will  I thought fit to give you this intimation lest otherwise if he should come you should be too much surprised  He flatters himself that you are not so ill as I represent you to be When he sees you he will be convinced that the most obliging things he can do will be as proper to be done for the sake of his own future peace of mind as for your healthsake and I dare say in fear of hurt∣ing the latter he will forbear the thoughts of any further intrusion at least while you are so much indisposed So that  one halfhour's shock  if it  will  be a shock to see the unhappy man but just got up himself from a dangerous fever will be all you will have occasion to stand  I beg you will not too much hurry and discompose  yourself It is impossible he can be in town till Monday at soonest And if he resolve to come I hope to be at Mr Smith's before him  I am Madam with the profoundest veneration  Your most faithful and most obedient Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER CXXII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    In Answer to his of Aug    p    Sunday Aug    WHAT an unmerciful fellow art thou A man has no need of a conscience who has such an imper∣tinent monitor But if Nic Rowe wrote a Play that answers not his title am I to be reflected upon for thatI have sinned I repent I would repairShe for∣gives my sin She accepts my repentance But she won't let me repairWhat wouldst have me do  But get thee gone to Belton as soon as thou canst Yet whether thou goest or not up I  must  go and see what I can do with the sweet oddity myself The moment these  prescribing  varlets will let me depend upon it I go Nay Lord M thinks she ought to permit me one interview His opinion has great authority with mewhen it squares with my own And I have assured him and my two cou∣sins that I will behave with all the decency and respect that man can behave with to the person whom he  most  re∣spects And so I will Of this if thou choosest not to go to Belton mean time thou shalt be witness  Colonel Morden thou hast heard me say is a man of honour and braveryBut Colonel Morden has had his girls as well as you and I And indeed either openly or secretly who has not The devil always baits with a pretty wench when he angles for a man be his age rank or de∣gree what it will  I have often heard my Beloved speak of the Colonel with great distinction and esteem I wish he could make matters a little easier for her mind's sake between the rest of the implacables and herself  Methinks I am sorry for honest Belton But a man  cannot be ill or vapourish but thou liftest up thy shriekowl note and killest him immediately None but a fel∣low who is fit for a drummer in death's forlornhope could take so much delight as thou dost in beating a deadmarch with thy goosequills  I shall call thee seriously to account when I see thee for the extracts thou hast given the lady from my letters not∣withstanding what I said in my last especially if she con∣tinue to refuse me An hundred times have I known a woman deny yet comply at last But by these extracts thou hast I doubt made her bar up the door of her heart as she used to do her chamberdoor against me This therefore is a disloyalty that friendship cannot bear nor honour allow me to forgive  LETTER CXXIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    London  Aug    Monday  I Believe I am bound to curse thee Jack Nevertheless I won't anticipate but proceed to write thee a longer letter than thou hast had from me for some time past So here goes  That thou mightest have as little notice as possible of the time I was resolved to be in town I set out in my Lord's chariot and six yesterday as soon as I had dispatched my letter to thee and arrived in town last night For I knew I could have no dependance on thy friendship where Miss Harlowe's humour was concerned  I had no other place so ready and so was forced to go to my old lodgings where also my wardrobe is and there I poured out millions of curses upon the whole crew and refused to see either Sally or Polly and this not only for suffering the lady to escape but for the villainous ar∣rest and for their insolence to her at the officer's house  I dress'd myself in a neverworn suit which I had in∣tended for one of my weddingsuitsAnd liked myself so well that I began to think with thee that my outside was the best of me  I took a chair to Smith's my heart bounding in almost audible thumps to my throat with the assured expectation  of seeing my Beloved I clasped my fingers as I was danced along I charged my eyes to languish and sparkle by turns I talked to my knees telling them how they must bend and in the language of a charming describer acted my part in fancy as well as spoke it to myself  Tenderly kneeling  thus  will I complain  Thus  court her pity and  thus  plead my pain  Thus  sigh for fancied frowns if frowns should rise  And  thus  meet favour in her softning eyes  In this manner entertained I myself till I arrived at Smith's and there the fellows set down their gay burden Off went their hats Will ready at hand in a new livery up went the head out rush'd my Honour the woman behind the compter all in fluttersrespect and fear giving due solemnity to her features and her knees I doubt not knocking against the inside of her wainscot fence  Your servant MadamWill let the fellows move to some distance and wait  You have a young lady lodges here Miss Harlowe Madam Is she above  Sir Sir and please your Honour The woman is struck with my figure thinks I Miss Harlowe Sir There is indeed such a young lady lodges hereBut but  But what Madam I must see her One pair of stairs is it notDon't trouble yourselfI shall find her apartment And was making towards the stairs  Sir Sir the lady the lady is not at homeShe is abroadShe is in the country  In the country Not at homeImpossible You will not pass this story upon me good woman I  must  see her I have business of life and death with her  Indeed Sir the lady is not at home Indeed Sir she is abroad  She then rung a bell John cried she pray step downIndeed Sir the lady is not at home  Down came John the good man of the house when I expected one of his journeymen by her sawcy familiarity  My dear said she the gentleman will not believe Miss Harlowe is abroad  John bow'd to my fine cloaths Your servant SirIn∣deed  the lady is abroad She went out of town this morn∣ing by six o'clockinto the countryby the Doctor's ad∣vice  Still I would not believe either John or his wife I am sure said I she cannot be abroad I heard she was very illShe is not able to go out in a coach Do you know Mr Belford friend  Yes Sir I have the honour to know 'Squire Belford He is gone into the country to visit a sick friend He went on Saturday Sir  This had also been told from thy lodgings to Will whom I sent to desire to see thee on my first coming to town  Well and Mr Belford wrote me word that she was ex∣ceeding ill How then can she be gone out  O Sir she is very ill very ill indeedCould hardly walk to the coach  Belford thought I  himself  knew nothing of the time of my coming neither can he have received my letter of yesterday And so ill 'tis impossible she would go out  Where is her servant Call her servant to me  Her servant Sir is her nurse She has no other And  she  is gone with her  Well friend I must not believe you You'll excuse me but I must go up stairs myself And was stepping up  John hereupon put on a serious and a less respectful faceSir this house is mine and  And  what friend not doubting then but she was aboveI must and will see her I have authority for it I am a justice of peace I have a search warrant  And up I went they following me muttering and in a plaguy flutter  The first door I came to was lock'd I tapp'd at it  The lady Sir has the key of her own apartment  On the inside I question not my honest friend tapping again And being assured if she heard my voice that her timorous and soft temper would make her betray her∣self by some flutters to my listening ear I said aloud I am confident Miss Harlowe is here Dearest Madam open the door Admit me but for one moment to your presence  But neither answer nor fluttering saluted my ear and the people being very quiet I led on to the next apartment and the key being on the outside I opened it and looked all round it and into the closet  The man said He never saw so uncivil a gentleman in his life  Hark thee friend said I Let me advise thee to be a little decent or I shall teach thee a lesson thou never learnedst in all thy life  Sir said he 'tis not like a gentleman to affront a man in his own house  Then pr'ythee man replied I don't crow upon thine own dunghill  I stepped back to the locked door My dear Miss Har∣lowe I beg of you to open the door or I'll break it openpushing hard against it that it crack'd again  The man looked pale and trembling and with his fright made a plaguy long face and called to one of his bodicemakers above  Joseph come down quickly  Joseph came down A lion'sface grinning fellow thick and short and bushyheaded like an old oakpol∣lard Then did master John put on a sturdier look But I only humm'd a tune travers'd all the other apartments sounded the passages with my knuckles to find whether there were private doors and walked up the next pair of stairs singing all the way John and Joseph and Mrs Smith following me trembling  I looked round me there and went into two opendoor bedchambers searched the closets the passages and peeped thro' the keyhole of another No Miss Harlowe by Jupiter What shall I doWhat shall I doNow will she be grieved that she is out of the way  I said this on purpose to find out whether these people knew the lady's story and had the answer I expected from Mrs SmithI believe not Sir said she  Why so Mrs Smith Do you know who I am  I can guess Sir  Whom do you guess me to be  Your name is Mr Lovelace Sir I make no doubt  The very same But how came you to guess so well dame Smith You never saw me beforeDid you  Here Jack I laid out for a compliment and missed it  'Tis easy to guess Sir for there cannot be two such gentlemen as you  Well said dame SmithBut mean you  good  or  badHandsome  was the least I thought she would have said  I leave you to guess Sir  Condemned thinks I by myself on this appeal  Why father Smith thy wife is a wit manDidst thou ever find that out beforeBut where is widow Lo∣vick dame Smith My cousin John Belford says she is a very good woman Is she within Or is  she  gone with Miss Harlowe too  She will be within byandby Sir She is not with the lady  Well but my good dear Mrs Smith where is the lady gone And when will she return  I can't tell Sir  Don't tell fibs dame Smith don't tell fibs chucking her under the chin Which made John's upperlip with chin shortened rise to his noseI am sure you knowBut here's another pair of stairs Let us see Who lives up there But hold here's another room lock'd up tapping at the doorWho's at home cry'd I  That's Mrs Lovick's apartment She is gone out and has the key with her  Widow Lovick rapping again I believe you are at home Pray open the door  John and Joseph muttered and whispered together  No whispering honest friends 'Tis not manners to whisper Joseph what said John to thee  JOHN Sir disdainfully repeated the good woman  I beg pardon Mrs Smith But you see the force of ex∣ample Had  you  shewed your honest man more respect  I  should Let me give you a piece of adviceWomen who treat their husbands irreverently teach strangers to use them with contempt There honest master John why dost not pull off thy hat to meO so thou wouldst if thou hadst it on But thou never wearest thy hat in thy wife's presence I believe dost thou  None of your fleers and your jeers Sir cry'd John I wish every married pair lived as happily as we do  I wish so too honest friend But I'll be hang'd if thou hast any children  Why so Sir  Hast thouAnswer me man Hast thou or not  Perhaps not Sir But what of that  What of thatWhy I'll tell thee The man who has no children by his wife must put up with plain John Hadst thou a child or two thou'dst be called Mr Smith with a courtesy or a smile at least at every word  You are very pleasant Sir replied my dame I fancy if either my husband or I had as much to answer for as I know whom we should not be so merry  Why then dame Smith so much the worse for those who were obliged to keep you company But I am not merryI am sadHeyhoWhere shall I find my dear Miss Harlowe  My beloved Miss Harlowe calling at the foot of the third pair of stairs if you are above for God's sake an∣swer me I am coming up  Sir said the good man I wish you'd walk down The servants rooms and the working rooms are up those stairs and another pair and nobody's there that you want  Shall I go up and see if Miss Harlowe be there Mrs Smith  You may Sir if you please  Then I won't for if she was you would not be so obliging  I am ashamed to give you all this attendance You are the politest traders I ever knew Honest Joseph slapping him upon the shoulders on a sudden which made him jump didst ever grin for a wager manFor the rascal seemed not displeased with me and cracking his flat face from ear to ear with a distended mouth shew'd his teeth as broad and as black as his thumbnails But don't I hinder thee What canst earn aday man  Half a crown I can earn aday with an air of pride and petulance at being startled  There then is a day's wages for thee But thou needest not attend me further  Come Mrs Smith come John master Smith I should  say let's walk down and give me an account where the lady is gone and when she will return  So down stairs led I John and Joseph tho' I had dis∣charged the latter and my dame following me to shew their complaisance to a stranger  I reentered one of the firstfloor rooms I have a great mind to be your lodger For I never saw such obliging folks in my life What rooms have you to lett  None at all Sir  I am sorry for that But whose is this  Mine Sir chuffily said John  Thine man Why then I will take it of thee This and a bedchamber and a garret for my servant will con∣tent me I will give thee thy own price and half a guinea a day over for those conveniencies  For ten guineas a day Sir  Hold John Master Smith I should sayBefore thou speakest considerI won't be affronted man  Sir I wish you'd walk down said the good woman Really Sir you take  Great liberties I hope you would not say Mrs Smith  Indeed Sir I was going to say something like it  Well then I am glad I prevented you for the words better become my mouth than yours But I must lodge with you till the lady returns I  believe  I must How∣ever you may be wanted in the shop so we'll talk that over there  Down I went they paying diligent attendance on my steps  When I came into the shop seeing no chair or s  ool I went behind the compter and sat down under an arched kind of canopy of carvedwork which these proud traders emulating the royal nichfillers often give them∣selves while a jointstool perhaps serves those by whom they get their bread Such is the dignity of trade in this mercantile nation  I looked about me and above me and told them I was very proud of my seat asking If John were ever per∣mitted to fill this superb nich  Perhaps he was he said very surlily  That is it cry'd I that makes thee look so like a sta∣tue man  John looked plaguy glum upon me But his man Jo∣seph and my man Will turned round with their backs to us to hide their grinning with each his fist in his mouth  I asked What it was they sold  Powder and washballs and snuff they said and gloves and stockens  O come I'll be your customer Will do I want washballs  Yes and please your Honour you can dispense with one or two  Give him half a dozen dame Smith  She told me she must come where I was to serve them Pray Sir walk from behind the compter  Indeed but I won't The shop shall be mine Where are they if a customer should come in  She pointed over my head with a pursemouth as if she would not have simper'd could she have help'd it I reached down the glass and gave Will six Thereput 'em up sirrah  He did grinning with his teeth out before which touching my conscience as the loss of them was owing to me Joseph said I come hither Come hither man when I bid thee  He stalked towards me his hands behind him half willing and half unwilling  I suddenly wrapt my arm round his neck Will thy penknife this moment Dn the fellow where's thy penknife  O Lord said the pollardheaded dog struggling to get his head loose from under my arm while my other hand was muzzling about his cursed chaps as if I would take his teeth out  I will pay thee a good price man Don't struggle thus The penknife Will  O Lord cry'd Joseph struggling still more and more And out comes Will's pruningknife for the rascal is a gardener in the country I have only this Sir  The best in the world to launch a gum Dn the fel∣low why dost struggle thus  Master and Mistress Smith being afraid I suppose that I had a design upon Joseph's throat because he was their  champion and this indeed made me take the more no∣tice of him coming towards me with countenances tragi∣comical I let him go  I only wanted said I to take out two or three of this rascal's broad teeth to put them into my servant's jawsAnd I would have paid him his price for themI would by my soul Joseph  Joseph shook his ears and with both hands stroaked down smooth as it would lie his bushy hair and looked at me as if he knew not whether he should laugh or be angry But after a stupid stare or two stalked off to the other end of the shop nodding his head at me as he went still stroaking down his hair and took his stand by his master facing about and muttering that I was plaguy strong in the arms and he thought would have throttled him Then folding his arms and shaking his bristled head added 'Twas well I was a gentleman or he would not have taken such an affront  I demanded where their rappee was The good woman pointed to the place and I took up a scollopshell of it refusing to let her weigh it and filled my box And now Mrs Smith said I where are your gloves  She shewed me and I chose four pair of them and set Joseph who looked as if he wanted to be taken notice of again to open the fingers  A female customer who had been gaping at the door came in for some Scots snuff and I would serve her The wench was plaguy homely and I told her so or else I said I would have treated her She in anger No woman is homely in her own opinion threw down her peny and I put it in my pocket  Just then turning my eye to the door I saw a pretty genteel lady with a footman after her peeping in with a What's the matter good folks to the starers and I ran to her from behind the compter and as she was making off took her hand and drew her into the shop begging that she would be my customer for that I had but just be∣gun trade  What do you sell Sir said she smiling but a little surprised  Tapes ribbands silklaces pins and needles for I am  a pedlar Powder patches washballs stockens garters snuffs and pincushionsDon't we goody Smith  So in I gently drew her to the compter running behind it myself with an air of great diligence and obligingness I have excellent gloves and washballs Madam Rappee Scots Portugal and all sorts of snuff  Well said she in very good humour I'll encourage a young beginner for once Here Andrew to her footman you want a pair of gloves don't you  I took down a parcel of gloves which Mrs Smith point∣ed to and came round to the fellow to fit them on myself  No matter for opening them said I Thy fingers friend are as stiff as drumsticks PushThou'rt an aukward dog I wonder such a pretty lady will be followed by such a clumsy varlet  The fellow had no strength for laughing And Joseph was mightily pleased in hopes I suppose I would bor∣row a few of Andrew's teeth to keep him in countenance And like all the world as the jest was turned from them∣selves father and mother Smith seem'd diverted with the humour  The fellow said the gloves were too little  Thrust and be dn'd to thee said I Why fellow thou hast not the strength of a cat  Sir Sir said he laughing I shall hurt your Honour's side  Dn thee thrust I say  He did and burst out the sides of the glove  Will said I where's thy pruningknife By my soul friend I had a good mind to pare thy cursed paws But come here's a larger pair Try them when thou gettest home and let thy sweetheart if thou hast one mend the other and so take both  The lady laughed at the humour as did my fellow and Mrs Smith and Joseph Even John laughed tho' he seemed by the force put upon his countenance to be but half pleased with me neither  Madam said I and stept behind the compter bowing over it now I hope you will buy something for yourself Nobody shall use you better nor sell you cheaper  Come said she give me six penyworth of Portugal snuff  They shewed me where it was and I served her and said when she would have paid me I took nothing at my opening  If I treated her footman she told me I should not treat her  Well with all my heart said I 'Tis not for Us trades∣men to be saucyIs it Mrs Smith  I put her sixpence in my pocket and seizing her hand took notice to her of the croud that had gathered about the door and besought her to walk into the back shop with me  She struggled her hand out of mine and would stay no longer  So I bow'd and bid her kindly welcome and thanked her and hoped I should have her custom another time  She went away smiling and Andrew after her who made me a fine bow  I began to be out of countenance at the crowd which thicken'd apace and bid Will order the chair to the door  Well Mrs Smith with a grave air I am heartily sorry Miss Harlowe is abroad You don't tell me where she is  Indeed Sir I cannot  You  will  not you meanShe could have no notion of my coming I came to town but last night Have been very ill She has almost broke my heart by her cru∣elty You know my story I doubt not Tell her I must go out of town tomorrow morning But I will send my servant to know if she will favour me with one halfhour's conversation for as soon as I get down I shall set out for Dover in my way to France if I have not a coun∣termand from her who has the sole disposal of my fate  And so flinging down a Portugal Sixandthirty I took Mr Smith by the hand telling him I was sorry we had not more time to be better acquainted and bidding ho∣nest Joseph farewell who purs'd up his mouth as I passed by him as if he thought his teeth still in jeopardy and bidding Mrs Smith adieu and to recommend me to her fair lodger humm'd an air and the chair being come whipt into it the people about the door seeming to be in good humour with me one crying A pleasant gentle∣man  I warrant him And away I was carried to White's according to direction  As soon as I came thither I ordered Will to go and change his cloaths and to disguise himself by putting on his black wig and keeping his mouth shut and then to dodge about Smith's to inform himself of the lady's motions  I GIVE thee this impudent account of myself that thou mayst rave at me and call me harden'd and what thou wilt For in the first place I who had been so lately ill was glad I was alive and then I was so balked by my charmer's unexpected absence and so ruffled by that and by the bluff treatment of father John that I had no other way to avoid being out of humour with all I met with Moreover I was rejoiced to find by the lady's absence and by her going out at six in the morning that it was im∣possible she should be so ill as thou representedst her to be and this gave me still higher spirits Then I know the Sex always love chearful and humorous fellows The dear creature herself used to be pleased with my gay tem∣per and lively manner and had she been told that I was blubbering for her in the back shop she would have de∣spised me still more than she does  Furthermore I was sensible that the people of the house must needs have a terrible notion of me as a savage bloodyminded obdurate fellow a perfect womaneater and no doubt expected to see me with the claws of a lion and the fangs of a tyger and it was but policy to shew them what a harmless pleasant fellow I am in or∣der to familiarize the John's and the Joseph's to me For it was evident to me by the good woman's calling them down that she thought me a dangerous man Whereas now John and I having shaken hands together and dame Smith having seen that I have the face and hands and looks of a man and walk upright and prate and laugh and joke like other people and Joseph that I can talk of taking his teeth out of his head without doing him the least hurt they will all at my next visit be much more easy and pleasant with me than Andrew's gloves were to him and we shall be  hail fellow well met  as the say∣ing  is and as thoroughly acquainted as if we had known one another a twelvemonth  When I returned to our mother's I again cursed her and all her nymphs together and still refused to see ei∣ther Sally or Polly I raved at the horrid arrest and told the old dragon that it was owing to her and hers that the fairest virtue in the world was ruined my reputation for ever blasted and that I was not married and happy in the love of the most excellent of her sex  She to pacify me said she would shew me a new face that would please me since I would not see my Sally who was dying for grief  Where is this new face cry'd I Let me see her tho' I shall never see any face with pleasure but Miss Harlowe's  She won't come down reply'd she She will not be at the word of command yet Is but just in the tramels and must be waited upon I'll assure you and courted much besides  Ay said I that looks well Lead me to her this instant  I followed her up And who should she be but that little toad Sally  O curse you said I for a devil is it you Is yours the new face  O my dear dear Mr Lovelace cry'd she I am glad anything will bring you to me And so the little beast threw herself about my neck and there clung like a cat Come said she what will you give me and I'll be vir∣tuous for a quarter of an hour and mimic your Clarissa to the life  I was  Belforded  all over I could not bear such an in∣sult upon the dear creature for I have a soft and gene∣rous nature in the main whatever you think and cursed her most devoutly for taking her name in her mouth in such a way But the little devil was not to be balked but fell a crying sobbing praying begging exclaiming fainting so that I never saw my lovely girl so well aped and I was almost taken in for I could have fancied I had her before me once more  O this Sex this artful Sex There's no minding them At first indeed their grief and their concern may be real But give way to the hurricane and it will soon die away  in soft murmurs trilling upon your ears like the notes of a welltuned viol And by Sally one sees that Art will generally so well supply the place of Nature that you shall not easily know the difference Miss Harlowe indeed is the only woman in the world I believe that can say in the words of her favourite Job for I can quote a text as well as she  But it is not so with me  They were very inquisitive about my fair one They told me that you seldom came near them that when you did you put on plaguy grave airs would hardly stay five minutes and did nothing but praise Miss Harlowe and lament her hard fate In short that you despised them was full of sentences and they doubted not in a little while would be a lost man and marry  A pretty character for thee is it not Thou art in a blessed way yet hast nothing to do but to  go on in it  and then what a work hast thou to go through If thou turnest back these sorceresses will be like the Czar's Cossacks at Pultowa I think it was who were planted with ready primed and cocked pieces behind the regulars in order to shoot them dead if they did not push on and conquer and then wilt thou be most lamentably despised by every harlot thou hast made And O Jack how formidable in that case will be the number of thy enemies  I intend to regulate my motions by Will's intelligence for see this dear creature I must and will Yet I have pro∣mised Lord M to be down in two or three days at far∣thest for he is grown plaguy fond of me since I was ill  I am in hopes that the word I left that I am to go out of town tomorrow morning will soon bring the lady back again  Mean time I thought I would write to divert thee while thou art of such importance about the dying and as thy servant it seems comes backward and forward every day perhaps I may send thee another tomorrow with the particulars of the interview between the dear lady and me after which my soul thirsteth  LETTER CXXIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Aug    I Must write on to divert myself For I can get no rest no refreshing rest I awaked just now in a cursed fright How a man may be affected by dreams  Methought I had an interview with my beloved I found her all goodness condescension and forgiveness She suffer'd herself to be overcome in my favour by the joint intercessions of Lord M Lady Sarah Lady Betty and my two cousins Montague who waited upon her in deep mourning the ladies in long trains sweeping after them Lord M in a long black mantle trailing after  him  They told her they came in these robes to ex∣press their sorrow for my sins against her and to im∣plore her to forgive me  I myself I thought was upon my knees with a sword in my hand offering either to put it up in the scabbard or to thrust it into my heart as she should com∣mand the one or the other  At that moment her cousin Morden I thought all of a sudden flash'd in thro' a window with his drawn swordDie Lovelace said he this instant die and be damned if in earnest thou repairest not by marriage my cousin's wrongs  I was rising to resent this insult I thought when Lord M run between us with his great black mantle and threw it over my face And instantly my charmer with that sweet voice which has so often played upon my ravished ears wrapped her arms round me muffled as I was in my Lord M's mantle O spare spare my Lovelace And spare O Lovelace my beloved cousin Morden Let me not have my distresses augmented by the fall of either or both of those who are so dear to me  At this charmed with her sweet mediation I thought I would have clasped her in my arms When immedi∣ately the most angelic form I had ever beheld vested all in transparent white descended from a ceiling which opening discovered a ceiling above that stuck  round with golden cherubs and glittering seraphs all exulting Welcome welcome welcome and encircling my charmer ascended with her to the region of sera∣phims and instantly the opening ceiling closing I lost sight of  her  and of the  bright form  together and found wrapt in my arms her azure robe all stuck thick with stars of embossed silver which I had caught hold of in hopes of detaining her but was all that was left me of my beloved Miss Harlowe And then horrid to relate the floor sinking under  me  as the ceiling had opened for  her  I dropt into a hole more frightful than that of El∣den and tumbling over and over down it without view of a bottom I awaked in a panic and was as effectu∣ally disordered for half an hour as if my dream had been a reality  Wilt thou forgive me troubling thee with such visionary stuff Thou wilt see by it only that sleeping or waking my Clarissa is always present with me  But here this moment is Will come running hither to tell me that his lady actually returned to her lodgings last night between eleven and twelve and is now there tho' very ill  I hasten to her But that I may not add to her indis∣position by any rough or boisterous behaviour I will be as soft and gentle as the dove herself in my addresses to her  That I do love her O all ye host of heaven  Be witnessThat she is dear to me  Dearer than day to one whom sight must leave  Dearer than life to one who fears to die  The chair is come I fly to my beloved  LETTER CXX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  CURSE upon my starsDisappointed again  It was about eight when I arrived at Smith'sThe woman was in the shop  So old acquaintance how do you now I know my Love is above Let her be acquainted that I am here  waiting for admission to her presence and can take no denial Tell her that I will approach her with the most respectful duty and in whose company she pleases and I will not touch the hem of her garment without her leave  Indeed Sir you're mistaken The lady is not in this house nor near it  I'll see thatWill beckoning him to me and whis∣pering See if thou canst any way find out without losing sight of the door lest she should be belowstairs if she be in the neighbourhood if not within  Will bowed and went off Up went I without further ceremony attended now only by the good woman  I went into each apartment except that which was lock∣ed before and was now also locked And I called to Miss Harlowe in the voice of Love but by the still silence was convinced she was not there Yet on the strength of my intelligence I doubted not but she was in the house  I then went up two pair of stairs and looked round the first room But no Miss Harlowe  And who pray is in this room stopping at the door of another  A widow gentlewoman SirMrs Lovick  O my dear Mrs Lovick said I I am intimately ac∣quainted with her character from my cousin John Belford I must see Mrs Lovick by all means Good Mrs Lovick open the door  She did  Your servant Madam Be so good as to excuse me You have heard my story You are an admirer of the most excellent woman in the world Dear Mrs Lovick tell me what is become of her  The poor lady Sir went out yesterday on purpose to avoid you  How so She knew not that I would be here  She was afraid you would come when she heard you were recovered from your illnessAh Sir what pity it is that so fine a gentleman should make such ill returns for God's goodness to him  You are an excellent woman Mrs Lovick I know that by my cousin John Belford's account of you and Miss Harlowe is an angel  Miss Harlowe is indeed an angel replied she and soon will be company for angels  No jesting with such a woman as this Jack  Tell me of a truth good Mrs Lovick where I may see this dear lady Upon my soul I will neither fright nor offend her I will only beg of her to hear me speak for one halfquarter of an hour and if she will have it so I will never trouble her more  Sir said the widow it would be death for her to see you She was at home last night I'll tell you truth But fitter to be in bed all day She came home she said to die and if she could not avoid your visit she was unable to fly from you and believed she should die in your presence  And yet go out again this morning early How can that be Widow  Why Sir she rested not two hours for fear of you Her fear gave her strength which she'll suffer for when that fear is over And finding herself the more she thought of it the less able to stay to receive your visit she took chair and is gone nobody knows whither But I be∣lieve she intended to be carried to the waterside in order to take boat for she cannot bear a coach It extremely incommoded her yesterday  But before we talk any further said I if she be gone abroad you can have no objection to my looking into every apartment above and below because I am told she is actu∣ally in the house  Indeed Sir she is  not  You may satisfy yourself if you please But Mrs Smith and I waited on her to her chair We were forced to support her she was so weak She said Where  can  I go Mrs Lovick Whither  can  I go Mrs Smith Cruel cruel man Tell him I called him so if he come again God give him that peace which he denies me  Sweet creature cry'd I and looked down and took out my handkerchief  The widow wept I wish said she I had never known so excellent a lady and so great a sufferer I love her as my own child  Mrs Smith wept  I then gave over the hope of seeing her for this time I was extremely chagrined at my disappointment and at the account they gave of her ill health  Would to Heaven said I she would put it in my power to repair her wrongs I have been an ungrateful wretch to her I need not tell you Mrs Lovick how much I have injured her nor how much she suffers by her rela∣tions implacableness 'Tis the latter Mrs Lovick 'tis That Mrs Smith that cuts her to the heart Her family is the most implacable family on earth and the dear creature in refusing to see me and to be reconciled to me shews her relation to them a little too plainly  O Sir said the widow not one syllable of what you say belongs to this lady I never saw so sweet a creature so edifying a piety and one of so forgiving a temper She is always accusing herself and excusing her relations And as as to You Sir she forgives you She wishes you well and happier than you will let her be Why will you not Sir why will you not let her die in peace 'Tis all she wishes for You don't look like a hardhearted gentle∣manHow can you thus hunt and persecute a poor lady whom none of her relations will look upon It makes my heart bleed for her  And then she wept again Mrs Smith wept also My seat grew uneasy to me I shifted to another several times and what Mrs Lovick farther said and shewed me made me still more uneasy  Bad as the poor lady was last night said she she tran∣scribed into her book a meditation on your persecuting her thus I have a copy of it If I thought it would have any effect I would read it to you  Let me read it myself Mrs Lovick  She gave it to me It has a Harlowespirited title And from a forgiving spirit intolerable I desired to take it with me She consented on condition that I shewed it to 'Squire Belford So here Mr 'Squire Belford thou may'st read it if thou wilt  On being hunted after by the enemy of my soul  Monday Aug  DELIVER me O Lord from the evil man Preserve me from the violent man  Who  imagines mischief in  his  heart  He  hath sharpened  his  tongue like a serpent Adders poi∣son is under  his  lips  Keep me O Lord from the hands of the wicked Pre∣serve me from the violent man  who hath  purposed to over∣throw my goings  He hath  hid a snare for me He hath spread a net by the wayside  He hath  set gins for me in the way wherein I walked  Keep me from the snares which  he hath  laid for me and the gins of  this  worker of iniquity  The enemy hath persecuted my soul He hath smitten my life down to the ground He hath made me dwell in dark∣ness as those that have been long dead  Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me My heart within me is desolate  Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble  For my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burnt as the hearth  My heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I for∣get to eat my bread  By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin  I am like a pelican of the wilderness I am like an owl of the desart  I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop  I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down  My days are like a shadow that declineth and I am wi∣thered like grass  Grant not O Lord the desires of the wicked further not his devices lest he exalt himself  Why now Mrs Lovick said I when I had read this meditation as she called it I think I am very severely treated by the lady if she mean  me  in all this For how is it that I am the  enemy of her soul  when I love her both soul and body  She says that I am a  violent  man and a  wicked  man That I have been so I own But I repent and only wish to have it in my power to repair the injuries I have done her  The  gin  the  snare  the  net  mean matrimony I sup∣pose But is it a crime in me to wish to marry her Would any other woman think it so and choose to become a  pe∣lican in the wilderness  or a  lonely sparrow on the housetop  rather than to have a mate that would chirp about her all day and all night  She says she has  eaten ashes like bread  A sad mistake to be sure and  mingled her drink with weeping  Sweet maudlin soul should I say of anybody confessing this but Miss Harlowe  She concludes with praying that  the desires of the wic∣ked  meaning poor me I doubt  may not be granted  that  my devices may not be furthered lest I exalt myself  I should undoubtedly exalt myself and with reason could I have the honour and the blessing of such a wife And if my  desires  have so honourable an end I know not why I should be called  wicked  and why I should not be allowed to hope that my honest  devices  may be  furthered  that I MAY exalt myself  But here Mrs Lovick let me ask as something is un∣doubtedly meant by the  lonely sparrow on the housetop  Is not the dear creature at this very instant tell me truly concealed in Mrs Smith's cockloftWhat say you Mrs Lovick What say you Mrs Smith to this  They assured me to the contrary and that she was actu∣ally abroad and they knew not where  Thou seest Jack that I would fain have diverted the chagrin given me by the womens talk and by this collec∣tion of Scripturetexts drawn up in array against me And several other whimsical and light things I said all I had for it for this purpose But the widow would not let me come off so She stuck to me and gave me as I told  thee a good deal of uneasiness by her sensible and serious expostulations Mrs Smith put in now and then and the two Jackpudden fellows John and Joseph not being present I had no provocation to turn the conversation into a farce and at last they both joined warmly to endeavour to prevail upon me to give up all thoughts of seeing the lady But I could not hear of that On the contrary I besought Mrs Smith to let me have one of her rooms but till I could see her and were it but for one two or three days I would pay a year's rent for it and quit it the moment the interview was over But they de∣sired to be excused and were sure the lady would not come to the house till I was gone were it for a  month  This pleased me for I found they did not think her so very ill as they would have me believe her to be but I took no notice of the slip because I would not guard them against more of the like  In short I told them I  must  and  would  see her But that it should be with all the respect and veneration that heart could pay to excellence like hers And that I would go round to all the Churches in London and Westminster where there were Prayers or Service from sunrise to sunset and haunt their house like a ghost till I had the op∣portunity my soul panted after  This I bid them tell her And thus ended our serious conversation  I took leave of them and went down and stepping into my chair caused myself to be carried to Lincoln'sInn and walked in the gardens till Chapel was opened and then I went in and staid prayers in hopes of seeing the dear creature enter But to no purpose and yet I prayed most devoutly that she might be conducted thither either by my good angel or her own And indeed I burn more than ever with impatience to be once more permitted to kneel at the feet of this adorable woman And had I met her or spy'd her in the Chapel it is my firm belief that I should not have been able tho' it had been in the midst of the Sacred Office and in the presence of thousands to have forborne prostration to her and even clamorous supplication for her forgiveness A Christian act the ex∣ercise of it therefore worthy of the place  After Service was over I stept into my chair again and once more was carried to Smith's in hopes I might have surprized her there But no such happiness for thy friend I staid in the backshop an hour and half by my watch and again underwent a good deal of preachment from the women John was mainly civil to me now won over a little by my serious talk and the honour I professed for the lady and they all three wished matters could be made up between us But still insisted that she could never get over her illness and that her heart was broken A cue I suppose they had from you  While I was there a letter was brought for her by a particular hand They seemed very solicitous to hide it from me which made me suspect it was for her I de∣sired to be suffered to cast an eye upon the seal and the superscription promising to give it back to them un∣opened  Looking upon it I told them I knew the hand and seal It was from her sister  See Vol  VI  p    And I hoped it would bring her news that she would be pleased with  They joined most heartily in the same hope And give∣ing the letter to them again I civilly took my leave and went away  But I will be there again presently for I fancy my courteous behaviour to these women will on their report of it procure me the favour I so earnestly covet And so I will leave my letter unsealed to tell thee the event of my next visit at Smith's  THY servant just calling I send thee this And will soon follow it by another Mean time I long to hear how poor Belton is To whom my best wishes  END of  VOL VI
