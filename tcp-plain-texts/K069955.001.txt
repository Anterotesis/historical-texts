 GLEANINGS IN  WALES HOLLAND AND WESTPHALIA  WITH VIEWS OF PEACE AND WAR AT HOME AND ABROAD  GLEANINGS THROUGH  WALES HOLLAND AND WESTPHALIA  WITH VIEWS OF PEACE AND WAR AT HOME AND ABROAD TO WHICH IS ADDED HUMANITY OR  THE RIGHTS OF NATURE  A POEM  REVISED AND CORRECTED  BY Mr PRATT  VOLUME I  See content the humble Gleaner  Takes the scatter'd ears that fall  LONDON PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN AND L B SEELEY PATERNOSTERROW  DEDICATION  BUT that the Gleaner knows  true  Generosity is ever governed by  true  Delicacy and that Persons really in Possession of those Qualities will literally  "Do good by Stealth and  blush  to find it Fame"  Nay that they would be actually  pained  by any public Recital of the private Conduct which it would even be honourable to human Nature to record he should with Pleasure and Pride enrich his Work with an Account of Actions that would justify him in changing the humble Title of his Book into something expressive of that copious  Harvest  which Talents Virtues and Misfortunes have been continually reaping from the Bounty of an Individual whose  sible for an honest man to see what was acting on the bloody theatre of the French nation while such an example of human degeneracy as Roberspierre filled the scene and conducted the drama without execrating every measure adopted by that  Scourge of Mankind  and all his accomplices But when according to the strictest law not simply of poetical or human but of divine justice those  The reader is intreated to pardon the liberty here taken with the sacred words of Shakspeare in order to render them more applicable  "Bloody instruments which he taught  "Have return'd to plague the inventor  "And evenhanded Justice has commended  "The ingredients of his poison'd chalice to  his own lips"  And when in the fall of that  Hero of Enormity  wherein all his petty instruments were involvedwhen by the bounty of Providence shewn in the salvation of his "taking off" the human race was in a manner  again  redeemed  from the utter destruction his insatiate appetite for the blood of man had complotted in short when the death of this tyrant proved the resurrection of humanity the degree of censure must diminish in proportion to the diminution of offences  I should be sorry to suppose there existed a man in GreatBritain however warmly his affections might glow and his heart beat in her cause who thought that the detested system of those tyrants abovementioned has not been meliorated by those who succeeded The successors were indeed the meliorators and though there yet remains much to be done ere a man who duly poises civil and political good and evil shall dare to assert all that was wrong is done away it would be as palpable an absurdity to confound their former with their present conduct as to compare utter darkness with the manifest rays of returning light  While the French people were the most flagitious amongst existing mortals the Gleaner reprobated them as such and he wishes that reprobation may serve the double purpose of  record and example  Now that their system is reformed in many of its worst abuses he is as earnest to congratulate as he had been to condemn And he dares aver that every considerate man in Englandnay more every considerate man who in loyalty or terror had sollicited the protection of any  other  country feels that the distinction here made is warranted  He cannot in any one feature soften the portrait drawn of the horrors which to the point of time he held the pencil deformed a devoted land Neither can he with feelings that would satisfy his own heart omit the opportunity of softening many of the shades and of expressing a wish interesting to every fibre of that heart and he trusts of a  million more that the picture not only of the bleeding land alluded to but of every other over which the sword of desolation is yet drawn may soon exhibit in the best light that PEACE WHICH IS MORE GLORIOUS THAN VICTORY  The greater part however of these Gleanings being written on less local and of course more comfortable because more humane subjectsthe beauties of nature and of artwill lose nothing of their interest by being thus "mixed with baser matter" for such war must ever be considered whether flushed with conquest or humbled by defeat The  utility  indeed of such observations as are designed to  "Guide the traveller on  his way"  and assist him in the article of expence c c must of course be  practically  suspended till  "Grimvisag'd War has smooth'd his wrinkled front"  For while every path abroad is clogged with blood it is to be presumed that few even of those who are disposed to quarrel with their country will uncalled by duty forsake that happy land in whose bosom amidst all their discontent they still find a SECURE AND PEACEFUL HOME  On a return to that  peaceful home  after looking for so long a time on its turbulent contrast in other lands the Gleaner hesitates not to confess that he felt all the ardour of a Briton and amidst the laudable enthusiasm of that character woo'd once more the Muse of  Sympathy a poem  Sympathy to pay her honest tribute to the country which in comparison of others he found literally what that Muse had called it  Th' asylum of the suffering earth  With the sacred effusions then that on this conviction flowed from his grateful heart he  shall open his GLEANINGSin the course of which he flatters himself no narrow prejudices of any kind will be found On the contrary prejudices will be strongly combated whether the growth of his own or any other country  ODE TO THE BENEVOLENCE OF ENGLAND  ADDRESSED TO ALIENS AND NATIVES  THESE VERSES DESCRIPTIVE OF THE CHARACTER OF THE BRITISH NATION ARE NOT HUMBLY BUT  PROUDLY  FROM A CONVICTION OF THEIR TRUTH INSCRIBED TO  ALIENS AND NATIVES  OF ALL PARTIES  A few copies of this Ode were printed immediately on the author's arrival from the Continent  ODE TO THE BENEVOLENCE OF ENGLAND  STRANGER would'st thou ALBION know  Ask the family of woe  Ask the tribes who swarming round  In her arms have succour found  Or if one of that sad band  Thou  hast sought her sacred land  To thy  heart  thou may'st refer  For BRITANNIA's Character  If  that heart hath pow'r to feel  This glorious truth it will reveal  Be thou the humblest child e'en  Care  will own  Or the illustrious ruin of a throne  'Twas not thy rank or station'twas thy GRIEF  Spread her protecting arms to offer thee relief  II  Yet stranger had'st thou brought her mines of wealth  Or come beneath the  smile  of Heaven  In all the gay festivity of health  Thou had'st but  bought  what she has given  Nor had thy purchas'd welcome been sincere  But never can'st thou doubt her homage to thy tear  III  Behold th' immeasurable train of care  Exil'd like thee to our BRITANNIA come  She their sure refuge in the last despair  The child of Sorrow's universal  home  Her Peasants with her Princes vie  Who shall softest balms supply  These  their Palaces bestow  And scepter'd Grief forgets its woe  Those  uplift the lowly latch  And beckon Sorrow to their thatch  Friend to the Wretched ALBION's equal eye  Warms like the Sun ALL human misery  IV  But favour'd Stranger would'st thou know yet more  Her tempersee her in the grace of Power  Oh if by some reverse of sudden fate  Conquest again should on her Banners wait  And her now exulting Foe  Yield to allsubduing woe  And in the hour of need  her  aid explore  From vict'ry fallen to distress  The Lion rage of ALBION would be o'er  Prompt to pardon and to bless  Her mighty heart would by the warmth of love  Melt to the softness of the mated dove  V  Ye fragments of each plunder'd coast  Check the Muse if here she boast  No ye sad Band who midst your ruins smile  Ye own for ye have felt the Genius of our Isle  ALBION succours all who sigh  Such is  her  EQUALITY  VI  Sure Pity's angel at her birth  Breath'd bounty in her soul to temper Power  And bade her be in deep Misfortune's hour  Th' asylum of the suffering Earth  VII  Say ye who with her spirit proudly glow  Her native sonssay have ye in her laws  Ye who have dar'd to hope for Heaven below  Found as her earthly mark some venial flaws  Nobly  reform thembut with filial hand  Devote yourselves to save a generous Land  Who  in an hour like this but would his force impart  His arm his bloodto guard a parent's heart  Say ye who now defended by her Laws  Ye Strangers in her gate would  ye  not rise  As her  adopted  Sons to aid her Cause  And dying triumph in the sacrifice  Yes ye have seen the wretch howe'er oppress'd  To her shelt'ring bosom fly  As if it were their tender mother's breast  And there as in a cradle lye  VIII  And shall those whom she has bred  Nurs'd in her arms and at her bosom fed  Shall her  own  Sons whom first she taught to know  The awful  Rights  e'en of that Alien's woe  And all the sacred truths which lye  In the rich code of Hospitality  Shall they forgetful of the precepts giv'n  Call down the "THANKLESS CHILD'S" dread curse from Heav'n  Ah no To save her from a  threaten'd  wound  What hosts have perish'd on the reeking ground  Nor shall th' embattled Thousands that remain  Inactive view this crisis of their fate  Her Patriots with a manly pride  All little quarrels thrown aside  All petty strife for place or power  The contests of an idle hour  Shall with one soul unanimously great  By wisdom and heroic deeds embalm their  Breth'ren slain  IX  Nor ye her Patriots doubt BRITANNIA's care  Nor think she will with fatal rashness DARE  To waste the treasure of her Children's blood  Alas already has the crimson flood  Like Life's rich streams drawn from their parent source  Profusely drain'd the allsupplying heart  The mass impoverished in its wholesome course  And check'd the action of each nobler part  X  This awful truth she feels in ev'ry vein  And feels it with an anxious mother's pain  And though to guard inviolate her Land  Her Laws her Life she claims the filial hand  Ev'n while she views her loyal Sons in arms  She trembles with a parent's fond alarms  With pride she sees bright FREEDOM grace  her  Throne  Nor grudges other States the blessings of her own  She wars alone with ruthless strife  That dooms the Orphan and the Wife  To dungeons chains or death  Because the Sire who gave them breath  Or the lov'd Lord in trembling terror flew  Proscription and his fate in view  And what their crimes Too oft the chance of birth  Sublimer genius or superior worth  Foe to the cruel  means  but to the END  BRITANNIA and her BRITONS are a friend  Oh ne'er would ALBION quench the sacred flame  Divinely bright that gilt  her  path to fame  Ah no when the dread thirst of blood is o'er  And ruthless rage shall stain the cause no more  With honest joy our ALBION shall embrace  Her Gallic foes and own them of a kindred race  XI  But when fair Honour's voice'twill be a voice from Heav'n  Shall cry Hold hold the  pow'r to spare  is giv'n  Thy Land thy Law thy Liberty secure  The offer'd Olive now will Peace ensure  O should she  then  with fell disnatur'd rage  Waste one rich drop of gen'rous ENGLAND'S blood  The Muse that freely gives this votive page  Will pour indignant Censure's broadest flood  Ev'n though like ROME's firm Sire to be sincere  Justice should strike her victim with a tear  THE GLEANER'S RETURN  Connected with these sentiments is a view at  Home  During the course of the war twice did the Gleaner revisit the benevolent land here praised The date of his first return will be ascertained when he observes that the cannon of Dumourier almost shook the battlements of the pleasant and kindly remembered little frontier town the  In Holland  Brielle of which a not scanty Gleaning will be found in its place Doubtful however of events he did not wish to abide the chance of being taken by the French whom his country had irritated he remained therefore on the apparently unsafe side of the water's  edge  till selfpreservation bade him set sail for the other for even as he sat in the cabin of the Packetboat in which he embarked the fire and smoke from the besiegers and the besieged at Williamstadt seemed to pursue the track of the vessel and made her tremble on the waves as if shaken by a  sea quake  She reached however the coast of Albion without any adverse  rencontre  and the Gleaner felt himself again  literally  on  terra firma  This happened in an advanced part of the spring he looked at the gardens of some cottages running down almost to the rim of the Ocean at Harwich and could not but exemplify  their  peaceful and prosperous state by applying pardon him a verse of his own Ah happy islanders  Humanity  "There's not a King dares rob ye of a Rose"  A few hours before he had witnessed even at Helveotsluice the internal the domestic foe of Holland unnaturally and almost openly assisting the machinations of the foe without The disaffected patriots of the  disunited  Provinces had spiked several of the cannon mutilated the cornmills and cast obstructions in the way of the waterworks to augment the difficulty should it become necessary to open the Dutch sluices The  Gleaner had the mortification to behold the English troops who were sent to assist the cause of these very people received with an air of chagrin by some and of poorlydissembled satisfaction by others and although Breda had been taken on the one side and Williamstadt attacked on the other insomuch that the Republic was almost rent in twain there was scarce a soldier or citizen who did not wish the transports that brought over the brave auxiliaries with a Prince of the English Realm at the head at the bottom of the sea He even overheard a Dutch burgher exclaim while the vessels filled with his noble countrymen were dropping their anchors "  the devil sink every one of ye  That is a pretty general opinion the Gleaner finds at home as well as abroad  You have no business here"  At the time of gaining the harbour the weather had been so stormy and the  sea ran so high there could not be a safe landing made for the troops who remained therefore on board the ships near three days Had you seen reader how the redoubted  patriots  of the Dutch enjoyed this temporary distress of the brave fellows who unused to the sea suffered more you would have presumed that instead of the troops coming to their protection they were attempting to land only to make them prisoners nay I am perfectly satisfied that a general wreck of near two thousand of the finest men in the world would have been a greater joy to numbers of the persons at that time assembled than what did for the moment really result from their assistance  The Dutch Patriots even then called it their  slavery  Their country being now in captivity they are become  free men  How long it may be before they sigh again for their former  slavery  it is impossible to determine So true is it that  "Our very wishes give us not our wish"  The Dutch are certainly an industrious but a most grumbling hive  the  Salvation of the Republic  From a variety of malicious actions and expressions the Gleaner is free to say that could they have poisoned the water or dared they to have envenomed the food they would have been glad to do either  After an absence of so many years his return at so singular a moment when the emigrant enemies of his country sued for its pity and protection and sued not vainly was attended with those sentiments which on his second return to his native land produced the Ode He had been witness to the ravages of many fair countries to the destruction of many beautiful towns majestic castles magnificent churches and the terror desolations and deaths of numbers of the human race and although the scenes which at that period of the war had pass'd under his eyes were soft and  merciful  in comparison of those he has  since  viewed and of which also descriptions  will in due order appear the contrast was powerful enough for him or for any man so circumstanced to have blest the British shore honoured the British King and venerated the British government had he  not  been born under their auspices had he even been their  foe  For the reverse of this picture then he looked  at home  In the midst of the most vigorous preparations for war he felt himself in the bosom of peace The sailors were singing and as it were fitting out for victory on the rigging regulating the top or guarding the bottom of their vessels The soldiers were merry in garrison or smiling on their post The huzza of  God save the King  reechoed to the waves French politics were scouted and good old English maxims were recited with hereditary veneration If even at  that  hour treason prophaned the realm it was conscious of no less shame  than weakness and like other unclean and ravenous beasts it shunned the day If ever the voice of loyalty was general it then resounded thro' comparatively the happiest land The contrast empowered the Gleaner to feel it in all its force In passing a little highroad village he saw a train of children of both sexes not forced into the service of the Convention at that time a new  Council of Blood  not carrying in their feeble hands the mangled heads or limbs of the brother or sister infants on whom  they had elaborated a murder  but a little battalion of boys and girls of British growth who catching the spirit of the times and of the country formed themselves into  volunteer  bodies and employed their scanty allowance of play hours in a kind of  military  nursery Their pocketmoney went to purchase drums whistles wooden swords spears guns and other instruments of mimic war A pair  of colours seemed to have been bought at the price of a flowered Sabbathday slip and Sunday waistcoat and a smart martial looking lad of about ten years of age was the commanding officer  Guess reader the nature of the Gleaner's sensations Consider the countries he had left and that to which he returned and when you are better acquainted with his usual habits you will not wonder he forgot that he had farther to go and in the warmth of the welcome oblivion which though it lost him a place in the coach was no deduction to his pleasure he followed the little troop round the town like a new recruit When it came to a stop the youth who commanded made a speech which was a morsel of most exemplary loyalty indeed for it blessed the king and then blessed God for blessing the king at the end of every sentence Though they  were by no means mercenaries they sollicited a little help from the company around just to answer military exigences The small corporal presented his cap to which all the birds of air appeared to have right loyally contributed a feather The Gleaner's mite was not withheld Indeed he was heated enough to have actually enlisted had they invited him to join the corps He left them with reluctance after they disbanded for the night which he pass'd at a little public house in the village Here he met with an honest kind hearted slipslop of a landlady a lovesick palefaced maiden who said  she  hated polities and a landlord who said  he  was a profound politician He had amusement at the moment in  Gleaning  them but as their counterparts are to be seen in almost every public house  "Where news much older than their ale goes round"  He shall wish them to be as well as they are  harmless and pass on He had intended to revisit London Some unexpected events determined him to another route and resolving to remain in the track of foreign intelligence he repaired to a place whither two motives guided him First its being a small spot near a great passagetown and secondly in a part of England he had never visited Having time to spare and a disposition to  Glean  you shall judge of his satisfactions He will endeavour to make you think you are a spectator of a  day's Gleaning in his native land  He began to compare all he had viewed in other places with the sweetly varied spots before him not so much with respect to their beauty as their secure tranquillity With regard to the surrounding residents he was amongst strangers but they were human beings and his countrymen or they were happy domestic creatures under the protection of an easy government He knew no one yet by a certain magic  that works in the heart of every philanthropist and without meriting that character he fears no man can be a patriot he seemed to be interested about every body and all the objects which his eyes could reach his heart seemed to embrace It appeared on this singular occasion as if he had met with a large part of his own family whom he had never before encountered and coming from foreign lands where anarchy and ruin had taken up their dwelling his heart bounded to behold all those who were at length brought so close to him in the fullest enjoyment of their lives and properties In other countries he had often seen the hired servants the peasant and farmers imperiously ordered to leave their own or their master's affairs and labour in the pleasure grounds or palace of some petty prince whose whole principality sometimes does not measure to the acres of a good English domain But in England the seed which the husbandman  had sown he was preparing to reap nor is it in the wish or the  power  of a monarch to plunder him of a moment His toil is his  own  so are the fruits of it And while he is getting in the copious harvest the expectations and efforts of the year are in many other parts of the globe seized on by lawless hands or clotted by gore to prevent it The carol of the  lawdefended subject  touched all the chords of the Gleaner's heart the birds that flew over his head seemed less independent and to have less of "perfect freedom" A party of haymakers were at the moment following the last wellheaped load or sporting on its top their rakes wreathed with triumphant garlands while a feast in the open air and within view of the finished haystacks awaited them Every syllable in the delicious description  "Now swarms the village o'er the jovial mead" c  of the British Maro was illustrated  How different is the jovial scenery in the poet's description from the inhuman yell of  Ca Ira  in the accursed times of Roberspierre for then was his horrible power in force opposite even as the song of rural innocence and the dissonant roar of guilt and rapine overrunning the fields It was a pleasant an interesting sight it warmed the bosom of the Gleaner to its inmost recesses he was in humour with every thing the comfortlooking huts the ample downs the sheep that fed upon them the soft and peacefulseeming inclosures the stretches of wood water and gardengrounds the captivating interspersed villas the aweful mansions and good old halls of hospitality the very cluck of the English household fowl and the domestic rookery He spoke to every labourer with the voice of a countryman and friend The charm was indeed heightened by a visit to the English cottages the appearance of the sturdy swains and blooming damsels who  inhabited themso utterly different in air dress complexion shapes and language from the peasantry he had quitted  Such is the journal of a flowery day's sensations in returning to the land whose scenery places and persons by a sort of indefinable attachment not only appears to belong to us but of which one seems to be a  part  Perhaps they were not the less agreeable to the Gleaner for the pains that afflicted his feelings in other countries How he wandered over gazed on and lingered in the scene He had fled from a repining and oppressed people oppressed beyond any power of relief and took sanctuary with the peaceful and contented All seemed natal The trees that shaded the sun that warmed the earth that received him and the air he breathed  And are there those who would reduce all  this  into a wilderness Ye Britons be  not deluded into misery Even that which may be a good cause to one nation may be a bad one to another  "Think O think  "How good the God of Harvest is to you  "Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields  Had the most clamorous the most discontented half the opportunities of the Gleaner they would even with all its errors think England the happiest country and themselves the happiest people now on the face of the globe As to  faults  he can only repeat the wish he has earnestly breathed in the Ode that they may be  "NOBLY reformed"  The Gleaner could have wished however to have found the benevolence of the country celebrated in the Ode more  uniform  and that while it was holding out the hand of  hospitality to distressed  aliens  who had been driven from their homes that it had ceased to inflict tyranny and slavery on a yet more numerous body of unfortunates He grieved to observe even on his second return an  The Slave Trade  evil which long before his setting out was deemed inconsistent with the mild humane and generally speaking wholesome principles of the British Government and which he had heard discussed on the Continent with every mark of wonder and reprobation It is almost needless to specify that he alludes to the immitigable  persecution  of more than half of the inhabitants of the globe merely because they differ from their  persecutors  in complexion  And yet we rank ourselves amongst the generous lovers of freedom and have bled in her sacred cause at every pore It is somewhat humiliating however that the very men we are fighting on the ground of imputed  barbarity  and considering too we have so long debated the subject in the great assembly of the nationto find that this  savage foe  against whose ferocity we have raised the arm should have  done  that generous act in a single day which Britons have been so many years  talking  about It cannot be denied that the French people have got the start of us in giving real freedom to that unhappy race of beings who though they have unquestionably all the rights of men are treated as beasts of the fields without  any rights at all  nay as condemned criminals who have by the prosoription of crimes forfeited not only  those  rights but every kindred claim that attaches to  species  or even springs from common charity The Gleaner certainly has been amongst the first as will appear on the face of these Gleanings to reprobate such parts of the French measures as justice no less than philanthropy must reject but he was one of the first to  honour  them for this part of their conduct Their plan of Equality  there  was great glorious and exemplary and even if it was but intended as a stroke of policy it ought like Abraham's faith to be imputed to them as righteousness Strenuously has the Gleaner insisted and will insist for ever because on the ground of eternal truth that  "THE RIGHTS OF MAN BY NATURE STILL ARE DUE  "TO MEN OF EVERY CLIME AND EVERY HUE  Humanity book ii  "  It is difficult to conceive indeed how the sons of avarice can bring their feeble arguments to carry any weight when in the opposite scale are to be placed all the motives of common honesty and every principle of justice and of reason And yet on coming home the author of the Poem abovequoted heard the same unwarrantable unfeeling and sordid arguments for  continuing  this iniquitous tyranny that had been polluting  the  public humanity of the country  so many years Nay the truly worthy  Mr Wilberforce  mover of the Bill for doing away this enormity has it seems been  harrassed out  with the perpetual checks his benevolent plan received It has been put off from time to time till most probably it will totally die away And all this in despite of the most liberal support from men of  all  parties led on by Pitt Fox Sheridan c  No wonder then that the Lyre has failed to effect what the best and brightest Powers of the British Parliament seem to have relinquished  in despair  As a last effort however the Gleaner will place his mite once again in the  way  of being seen by some of the advocates of this  unblessed unchristian trade  and should but  one  purchaser or salesman of his species be moved to pity and redress the wrongs of one enslaved fellowcreature he will triumph in having put an end  to the captivity of that one or if a niggard taskmaster still holds him in bonds deaf to the voice of nature and conscience the attempt will have been made and both conscience and nature shall unite to sooth the disappointment Bitter already has been that disappointment for he who praised the BENEVOLENCE of Albion had hoped she would have extended that freedom which she loves and which is the basis of her happiness beyond the narrow circle of  her own land  but as that is not the case it seems a duty imposed by compassion and justice on every man to awaken the public mind so far as in him lies to a sense of what it owes to this important subject For all these reasons instead of republishing the arguments which have been offered on this topic by the Gleaner in a separate form a new impression being called for those arguments shall be presented at the end of these volumes so shall the sheaves be crowned with a wreathe of HUMANITY  The introductory parts to our sheaves having hitherto been employed in homefelt subjects there will be a sort of propriety in closing therewith On which idea our preliminary matter shall conclude with a Gleaning of the English Stage which seems like many other things to have undergone a revolutionary shock and like some others we will not  now  say  all  to be by no means the better for it  MODERN THEATRES  TO J KEMBLE ESQ OCCASIONED BY SEEING HIS ADMIRABLE PERFORMANCE OF  PENRUDDOCK  MODERN

 But court no less the aid of tender showers  IN regard to the  Gleanings  themselves now to pass from the closet of an indulgent circle of private friends to the public I have by the nature and licence of the epistolary form of writing been led to say so much in the first person that in so seducing a part of speech I will not trust myself to enlarge in this general Introduction but conclude with quoting a passage in the account which has been given in one of the monthly publications of a "Journey" nearly in the track of the Gleaner by the author of "the Mysteries of Udolpho" and several other very beautiful compositions  "It is not always easy to obtain information that has not been communicated by some former pen but it will always happen that  the same objects shall be viewed in different lights by different persons and that the reader will be insensibly delighted with the appearance at least if not the reality of novelty"  However completely this judicious observation may apply to the labours of Mrs  The Gleaner cannot mention the merits of this charming writer without paying a passing tribute of no less justice in their different stiles to the exquisite pen of Mrs

the Continent he cordially took my hand and thus addressed me  You are going to travel travelling like love makes authors authors make books men women and children publish at home what they have seen or heard abroadErgo were not you already an author it would be expected of you to  write a book  To travel then and to publish are become things of course said I  As much so rejoined my friend as cause and effect  It would be difficult however I presume to prove that though they may be equally in order they are equal in value for to multiply  copies of copies of copies  is surely adding to the bulk of  an evil that  has increased is still increasing and ought to be diminished  I admit your observation proceeded I that every body publishes travels but am in doubt about the use of the inference for if people who leave their own country  predetermined  to make a book out of what they meet with what they see or seem to see in others it either is an argument against the farther overstock of the literary market or a proof positive that the innumerable  travelling bookmakers  who have "beat the beaten road" these thousand years have told us nothing we did not know better before and hereupon a pretty curious question arises How far those who have undertaken to conduct our persons and purses through countries remote or near have proved themselves true or false guides how far readers who have taken abroad with them such publications as the Vade Mecums of their respective tours have found themselves more or less perplexed and misled than if they had been left to their own ignorance and to the experience which however dearly perhaps more truly corrects it  You think then resumed my friend that an answer to these interrogations would determine the propriety of giving or refusing to give another book of travels to those already  published You imagine that a new edition every ten years of the first and only original work marking the fresh modes by way of addenda would preclude and render useless all the labours of imitative travellers  I told him this would be perhaps going too far but that were the replies to be made by those admirable critics the eye and the pocket we should  "see feelingly"  that our knowledge by no means increases in proportion to the number of our books on the same subject  It must be acknowledged interpos'd he that the regions not of fact only but of fairy land have been  overrun with travellers  Every thing therefore of either use or ornament might be supposed at this time of day to  "Live in description and look green in song"  but the truth is that much is always left to be found by him who is diligent to seek and that of the innumerable travellers who have gone the  same  roads there are few who have not added  something  to our stock of information or amusement and moreover that every person of talents  is in reality original  either in the matter or manner of exerting them no two people even of equal abilities  employing them on the same occasion seeing or feeling the very same objects or occurrences in the same way so that there must be I say a degree of novelty in every work not servilely purloined from what the plagiary had neither candour to avow nor ingenuity to improve But even granting that the greater crop of general observation has been gathered by others who have made their intellectual harvest abroad and brought it home  pro bono publico  let me remind you by the help of an allusion borrowed from husbandry that the vigilance of the farmer has never yet been able to clear the ground of its produce so as to leave nothing wherewith to reward the industrious  gleaner  Some ears of the valuable grain escape the jealous rake even of avarice itself and where the fields are spacious there must always be something worth stooping for even where the labourers are many  Pleased and encouraged by this mode of reasoning I exclaimed Be it so then another  Book of Travels shall be written  and to shew my gratitude for the present conversation the work shall owe its title to an idea that is this moment suggested by the agricultural images you have so agreeably played with I will call my book  that is to be GLEANINGS  c  gathering up whatever may be left to humble industry or excursive curiosity in the path of my wanderingsnow and then deviating into the fields of fancy mixing thus my  wheat  with such  flowers  as grow in its neighbourhood whether in hedge rows or gardens whether the productions of art or nature  Good cried my friend rubbing his hands together and at length you shall bind your collected gleanings into sheavesthat is volumesand present them neat as imported from the foreign markets to your  friends and enemies  To both of whom added he smilingly and with a brisker friction of his hands they will supply food of a different kind the one banquetting on whatever you set before them with hearty goodwill the other satiating on the best you can offer with as hearty malice Besides continued he you will thus furnish a feast to yourself and be entertained while you entertain  I will have it so  Farewell Be sure you write a book and do not return to me till you can come volume in hand  He departed without suffering me to say more asserting that the best proof of my regard for him would be given in my adoption of his councils  The councils were wholesome and I shall follow them Before my leaving London it was settled at another conversation with the same friend that my  Gleanings  were to be dispensed by parcels to  him  that he was to put them into the granarythat is his librarytill their bulk increased sufficiently to be of public use and not a month was to pass without a small  sheaf  being sent to him Alas it was decreed that ere the  first  month was expired this amiable counsellor and friend should go  "To that bourne from whence  no traveller  returns"  "Still drops from life some withering joy away"  saith our celebrated Johnson The impression made upon me by his death would perhaps have induced me to give up an idea which could not be pursued without a sentiment of regret for the loss of him who inspired it had I not reflected that there existed still  another  whose mind no less than my own required amusement and at length to conclude that the best mode of testifying my esteem and veneration for the deceased would be to fulfil  his  wishes even while I fulfilled yours my dear surviving comfort at the same time  To these ends I now address to  you  from the most beautiful part of the British Empire for  such I think we may fairly call the principality of the ancient Britons the first offerings of my Gleanings An humble employment perhapsto collect ear by ear as it were the  refuse  of what others have either  overlooked or neglected  but if out of this lowly occupation you and I my excellent friend in the first instance and my readers in the second when the corn is gathered into sheaves and bound up should be able to make that bread which strengtheneth the heart or press from the scanty vintage that wine of life which exhilarates and gives a cheerful countenance in the drooping moment if it affords the transient sweets of a foreign shore when the flowers at home are withered or despoiled I shall not have stooped in vain  Adieu my friend Our convention is settled and you shall soon hear from me again  LETTER II TO THE SAME  South Wales  AS it behoves a  Gleaner  to be diligent deliberate and not hurry over his ground like those who come to a  full crop  and whom abundance makes careless I have resolved not only for your sake but my own to stay always some days frequently some weeks and not seldom some months in every town city or village from whence I shall write A rule which inverts the general one Instead of adding to the long list of  posthaste travellers  I am determined to perform my journies at a footpace rather than a full gallop convinced from a deal of experience that although  he who runs may read  he who  rides as it were express through a country  cannot write any thing worth the attention even of a  running reader  At least it becomes a question worth answering whether the deliberate mode is not more likely to discover and describe what merits communication than the helterskelter fashion of writing on the spur whip and wheel our accounts of people and places I am of opinion it is and I have the support of good old people  and good old proverbs in Latin and English "  Festine lente"  says the one  He stumbles who goes fast  echoes the other To believe therefore that He who "  moves slow moves sure"  is a reasonable conclusion Indeed I have wondered that so very few of my emigrating countrymen have been of this way of thinking On the contrary they hurry through the destined course as if they were running a race against time and were to perform such a given portion of it within the hour by a stop watch  The most pleasantly  fanciful  at least of all modern travellers in his inimitable "journey" has given us in his own sportive manner a catalogue of travellers with the epithets proper to and characteristic of each such as the sentimental political idle diligent  et caetera  but he has not to my recollection said any thing about the  deliberate  or more correctly speaking the  residentiary  traveller who sets out on a plan of sojourning in the parts of the world he describes and mixes in the societies of each long enough to observe  accurately  manners customs and events The infinitely diversified modes of these must be overlooked seen very partially or not seen at all by the modern  Mercuries  who go at full speed to the grand  point of their destinationsome of the capitals and scarce give time for the horses to be changed at the intermediate stages or if they are under the  necessity  to stay a night at any of these the most inquisitive of them stroll thro' the streets or saunter round the ramparts  while the supper is preparing  the rest throw themselves on chairs and sophas till arous'd by the return of their companions who generally come back dissatisfied with their ramble and if they write at all sit down betwixt sleeping and waking and insert in the meagre journal of the day a drowsy yet splenetic account of what they met with in their walk depending on the sexton as the historian of the buildings and on some chance passenger as the intelligencer of the inhabitants environs police c c At day break the next morning they are off scarce allowing time for swallowing a comfortless dish of coffee squabbling with their host for extortion cursing the country they are under the immediate protection of and disgracing the manners of their own This done they continue their expedition  as upon life and death  and often alas how much too often finish their folly their fortune and their tour at the same time for it is not till after their return to their native country that these  dashing travellers  discover that their most precious thingstime money  and talentshave been wasted to receive only contempt fatigue and vexation in returna sad barter  But not to circumscribe the inutility of  rapid  travelling to these cyphers of society who in all countries are insignificant the remark I fear and the censure involves in some degree persons of a different description in as far as the customary method of  writing post  on the policy and practice of nations must be injurious to the most respectable abilities which cannot intuitively know occurrences characters and usages that arise out of  time place and circumstance  and cannot except to a lucky traveller indeed and to him very occasionally happen while arrangements are making for the accommodation of man and horse between stage and stage and when all one can expect to see are the most slight and ordinary objects that float like weeds and offal on the stream on the surface of the places through which we pass Neither is the human mind whatever be its powers well disposed to paint scenes and incidents when the body is worn down by the day's travel and the spirits jaded by the fatigue of motion yet if we look at the dating of our modern travels the avowed objects of which are customs and manners we shall find that most of  the observations are the productions of  the moment  written amidst the dust and hurry of going from the spot described to another which is in due time to be dispatched in the same way Is it therefore to be wondered at if we frequently find the common effects of an over hasty judgmentmistated facts and false inferences  All these convictions have strengthened me in the resolution of being a  residentiary  traveller making a rest in every country which I design to  glean  This you will say my dear friend is in character but I scruple not to assert on an experience which I hope to make you partaker of that tourmakers of the first distinction and respectability have left many things unnoticed highly worthy their and the public observation and which could not have escaped had they suffered their patience to keep pace with their penetration  The illustration of this I trust you will gather as we go along  The scenery of  Nature  in a summer dress is a volume open to every eye and a copious page may be read at a glance The most nimble traveller might luxuriate as he runs by them and his landscape though but the etching  of an instant of time must if he has skill to "catch the objects as they rise" and richness of genius to tint them be various and delightful Here the border of Brecknockshire which begins just where what is  now  called England owns its boundary I was enchanted with the  first  view but discovered at a second third fourth onward to a fortieth in various excursions to and fro during a six months' residence a thousand and ten thousand particular charms which a first general survey could never afford I devoted an equal proportion of time to the northern as to the southern division of this paradisaical principality going to the extreme verge both ways and traversing backwards and forwards to look at their beauties in different seasons of the year and it is the result of these repeated visits which at the present moment I give you I give it you in the grateful warmth of my heart for pleasure received not without an earnest hope at the same time that you and others who have taste and affections to relish the blooms of nature and patriotism enough to admire them not the worse for appertaining to their  natal island  may be tempted to enjoy the same scenery  That Wales hath a claim to preeminence on the score of romantic beauty can only be  doubted by those who never have traversed it or who traversing rather run a race than make a regular tour It is certain that several detached spots in several different English counties exhibit to the eye of the traveller as much of simplicity here and there as much of the sublime and frequently more of cultivation but then those are to be considered as pickt and chosen places and are therefore particular whereas the natural graces of Wales the spontaneous fragrance of the wild herbs and flowers the unrestrained redundance of the foliage and the unlaboured fertility of the southern soil are general They often expand from one shire to another with successions both of the beautiful and sublime sometimes to the stretch of thirty or forty miles in the progress of which the fancy and the heart the understanding and all the higher emotions of the soul are by turns regaled and delighted Hence it is impossible for a traveller of a just taste not to catch pleasure and instruction from that endless variety of land and water hill and valley dizzy ascent and apparently fathomless precipice which in Merioneth and Carnarvonshire would strike his eye at almost every hour's journeying The traveller of imagination would feel an unwonted glow of head and heart perhaps in a warmer degree and of a more fascinating  kind than the traveller of merely a just taste The poetic and pictorial traveller endued with the enthusiasm proper to those characters would have a more animated pleasure from a survey of such sort of beauties than a person who has been in the habit of deriving his satisfactions rather from the refined labours of art than the easy operations of nature but all degrees of understanding and feeling nay the soul itself would be gratified in a tour through Wales allowing time to do justice to nature and themselves and indeed none but the most worthless or dissipated of human kind could observe within the limit of a morning's ride or walk such an assemblage of natural wonders viewed at any period of the year without tasting a pleasure of that moral kind which in looking above or below must pronounce the objects of divine origin I have stood gazing on someSnowden and Plinlimmon the vales of and of Cluyn for instance till they seemed of themselves to sayTraveller well mayest thou gaze we merit your pious admirationfor we are of God  But my enthusiasm is running my letter into too much length Invoking therefore the blessing of that God on you I bid you for the presentadieu  LETTER III TO THE SAME  South Wales  A YOUNG painter of genius in a summer tour from Abergavenny to Milford Haven South and from Aberconway to Holyhead including the Isle of Anglesey North taking into his route the intermediate landscapes and seapieces right and left and making those pauses which are necessary to exact observation and those deviations from the beaten to the unfrequented tract where indeed the chaster beauties of nature are to be found as if they modestly withdrew from the gaze of every common passenger could not fail returning home richly stored with materials for the winter exercise of his finishing pencil Or more properly advised and duly ambitious of being just to nature as his original and to himself as her imitator were he to employ the winter only in giving to his first sketches a more correct form then to make the same tour the succeeding summer to meliorate and improve to catch new graces which new verdure may possibly have given them to bestow that mellowing which the most vigorous mind and brightest fancy derives from precision without which indeed every composition of  human art can hope but transitory fame were he then to occupy his second winter to the last polishes then send them to Somerset House I will venture to say he would exhibit to his country one of the most beautiful one of the most valuable collections that had till then been seen in the most select of her cabinets accompanied by this peculiar honour and noveltynamely that it was taken from an original properly her own a truth which nineteen out of twenty that had never seen that original would be far from suspecting nay I am furthermore convinced that even the best judges the most celebrated artists under the like predicament would distribute the different landscapes to as many different countries appropriating the scenery of one to Savoy a second to Lausanne a third to the beautiful Pays de Vaud and so on for all that characterise these lovely countries assemble in the principality of Wales The Cambrian excursion I have here recommended to the young and ingenious artists of my country in particular would were they to travel pencil in hand unite the merits of the patriot to the talents of the painter and be productive of objects no less worthy the lovers of their art than the lovers of their country It is hence that I would incite those who are blest with abilities  and who incline to devote them to the muse of painting to a journey of  deliberation  through Wales before they go farther from home convinced that if the study and imitation of nature only were as it obviously is the perfection of their art a great deal of that time and money which is expended in getting to the usual seminaries and scenery might be saved for I repeat that this little appendage to the crown of England contains within itself the richest stores for the pencil which can be contented with nature or with nature's God  Does the painter look for the broad and beautiful expanse of the sea with all its attendant rocks terminating towers romantic shellwork and surrounding shores They await him on the coast of Wales at innumerable openings They salute him at the new and old passage even as he first sets his foot on the Cambrian soil He meets them again gathering beauties as he goes in various parts of Caermarthenshire they smile on him as he visits the mouldering castle and romantic scenery of the sweet village Laugharne in that county At Kidwelly and Llanelthy they again regale Swansea offers them to him in all the pride of charms that have drawn the admiration of the fashionable world They accompany  refresh and delight him even to MilfordHaven where they lose themselves in unbounded ocean Nor are the marine objects less beautiful in the northern districts At Towyn Aberestwith Caernarvon Harleigh Penmorva Bangor Anglesey Barmouth c they increase in every grace of the grand and minute  Does the youthful enthusiast pant after the sublime beauties peculiar to the land Here are they in the most profuse abundance The mountains are here whose immense height illustrates and justifies that bold imagery of the Poet whose descriptions would appear the work of fancy and of fancy run riot to all those who have never yet look'd at the aspiring sublimities of nature as they present themselves in Merionethshire and other northern parts of this island The truth and the description of it are thus exactly given in the poetry of Goldsmith  "As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form  "Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm  "Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are spread  "Eternal sunshine settles on its head"  The clouds indeed seem sometimes to issue from the feet and sometimes from the bowels of these mountains in passing the steaming sides of  which the traveller is on the brightest day involved in the thickest mist while the summit of the mountain above and of the valley below are gilded by sunbeams which the vapours have not fullied  Or languishes our child of genius for the mountain Cataract whose white foam is precipitated by the torrent down its romantic but rugged sides till it reaches the distant vale where it rolls over the dark rocks made yet darker by the thick oaks that overhang them the deepest green moss growing on the parts of rock not washed by the turbulent but laved only by the gentle waves that occasionally overflow them Would he wish to hear a beauty that he could not paint the description of which he must resign to the poet viz The stunning sound of the same Cataract softening by degrees into the still small and sweet voice of the rill which steals gradually out of hearing along the woody dingle where it dies away If his genius leads to these they are to be met with in Wales I have clambered up the mountains where they were passable to human ascent I have followed the sound of the torrents from the first deafening impetuosity to the last of its meanders through the valley and have been paid for my excursion by innumerable  beauties which nature hides as it were in her nooks and corners and denies the sight or scent of to every one who does not deem them worth searching for It is almost a partiality unwarranted to point at any place in particular where these charms for the true lovers of nature may be discovered they are so generally distributed throughout the principality but if I am justified in giving the preference to any spots I should mention Merionethshire and the country about Pontipool as most replete with these beauties these and a thousand more  It is impossible for me indeed to give adequate sketches of the countless charms a traveller of genius will discover in this route The most vivid descriptions of Gilpin joined to the solid narratives of Pennant should rather animate than discourage to the journey The living eye of such a traveller should not be contented with any thing short of the living volume in every page and passage of which nature will here present him with something to admire and imitatesomething which though admired and described before will supply new description new imitation In truth the proper objects of genius can here never be exhausted nor genius itself fatigued with representing  them So redundant are the sports of nature in this happy soil that with a slight change of your point of view and the same spot of ground will afford a set of landscapes Taken from the top of the mountain you may sketch the valley apart and it is sufficiently enriched to fill your canvass and call your imitative powers into the warmest exertion taken from the valley you have another separate picture the first interesting soft and delicate the second noble animated and sublime join their several beauties by taking them in a middle direction between both and reverencing nature and yourself you will prove the truth of my before repeated assertion that it is unnecessary to quit your native empire to gain the wreathe of immortality as a painter  Excuse me I beg of you for thus enlarging on these beauties with a view to bringing them upon canvass but besides that I know you both love and cultivate the art in private many of our mutual friends amongst which is the enchanting De Loutherberg and the brother of the ingenious Barsett worthy the relationship are public ornaments of it I am persuaded that if the former of these artists were to visit the scenes I have here alluded to his most glowing and justly celebrated landscapes  from Switzerland which we have so often admired in his descriptions as well as on his canvass would have companions of Welsh extraction highly deserving that honour And I wish in your next conversation you would suggest these hints  But it is time to commit my long letter upon paintingswhich you may perhaps call an epistle to paintersto the post Farewell then for the present  LETTER IV TO THE SAME  North Wales  WHAT I have already said and what I still wish to communicate in regard to this finely romantic country is as I before noted rather the result of the remarks I made some months ago than what occurs at the present time My health as you remember compelling my immediate absence from London and my affairs nevertheless requiring some arrangement before I could quit the English territories for any length of time likely to do essential good to my constitution or to the circumstances that tended to impair it I accepted in the mean while of an occasion that offered to make a circuitous tour of Wales You may be sure that the sentimental pictures of Gilpin and the historical accounts of Pennant were in my portmanteau  Both of the above named authors being deliberate and even residentiary travellers nothing was left behind but a few general observations such as I have offered you in the two preceding letters and some local particulars of which I  have still to beg your acceptance but after so copious an harvest as has been presented by such labourers the Gleanings must needs be scanty though I hope well worth stooping for  The scenery of Mahuntleth is in the true stile of awful grandeur stupenduous rocks rising above one another in barren sublimity and forming a natural rampart round the town in the neighbourhood of which you ride through one of the most lovely vales even  your  imagination can conceive the more delightful for coming unexpectedly as on your first leaving the town you are prepared only for rocks instead of which you enter a lane about half a mile from the village which shuts you from the farther view of both rocks and village and conducts you along a green recess which continues for many miles every step almost of which introduces a fresh beauty Wood water hill and vale can scarce take a form the sound of streams the carol of birds the diversity of foliage can hardly be fancied by the most enthusiastic lover of nature which blends not in this short excursion Every thing blooms around you the mountains vegetate to the top all the tints and shades of verdure are in your view neat white cottages and pretty farmhouses  with here and there a modern villa or ancient mansion introduce themselves to your eye as you move on at such acceptable distances and in such happy situations that even a matter of fact traveller must forget all commonplace circumstances and wish to be  residentiary  What then must be the effect of such scenery on the children of fancy The poetical traveller for instance For my own part I was so rapt and entranced that giving my self up unreservedly to the enchantments that surrounded me I felt a sort of attachment to every object that contributed its beauty to the scene and was absolutely in friendship in alliance with the woods as if I had vegetated with them A sober citizen who had seen me at this time would have pronounced me mad but while he pitied me I should have compassionated him since in this kind of delirium arising from an heart and imagination delighted and as it were carried beyond themselves by the charms of nature there is a pleasure which what is properly understood by the words sober citizen never knew I have often told youwith selfgratification and grateful thanks to the bounteous bestowerof this my excessive sensibility of vegetable beauty It began from the first hour that I could distinguish betwixt sterility and bloom A garden a wood a rill an immense  mountain an almost untrodden path in a valley the interminable ocean the contracted stream and all that nature inherits were my delight when my love of them was rather instinct than observation The passion  grew with my growth and strengthened with my strength  It strewed roses over the years of my youth and made me often forget the numberless thorns which environed them The years of manhood that have strengthened my reason have in no degree abated my sincereI had almost writtenmy tender delight in these charms of the creation And why should I not feel a tender affection towards them Do they not lead from things temporal to things eternal from earth to heaven from creation to the Creator Is not therefore the adoration I pay to them a virtue A part of religious worship At the time I was enveloped  emparadised  let me call it rather in this blissful solitude I felt that it was a time more detached from the dross of the world and more pure than probably the best society could have made it Will the man of cold sense pronounce all this visionary No It is substantialto me at least it has been the source and I hope will continue to be of the highest sentiments and contemplation  May I live only while I am sensibly alive to the beauties of nature For in the hour this affection quits me the sacred sense of the great Author of these beauties which my exquisite sensibility of them kindles in my soulwhich even the lowliest shrub or simplest blade of grass now inspires could no more ascend to the power from whom I received this sensibility than the autumnal leaf that has withered on the ground can again mount and flourish on the tree from which it has fallen  The pleasure therefore of which I have been speaking is amongst the few that belong to the poetical mind in balance of the numberless evils which are said to be inseparable from the votaries of the muse  But you have been museled too long and I have to beg your pardon for a digression which offers you rather a description of my own sensations than of the place which excited them Let us return then to the sweet shades out of which my selfish fancy flew away with you I really abhor egotism but in letters that mix the history of ones feelings with that of our wanderings it is the most difficult thing in the world not to be an egotist All that can be fairly expected indeed in travelling epistles  is to make as it were our absent correspondent enjoy what we have enjoyed profit by his pleasures by making them our own if ever we take the same route and escape the inconveniences which he warns us to avoid In this character of a friendly directionpost I may be useful Take courage therefore and accompany me once more into the woods of Mahuntleth and let me instruct you by the way that this is a little market town in northern Cambria in the road to Aberestwith a town in some reputation as a bathing place you know If you who I know pay an annual visit to the sea nymphs should direct your watery course hitherward I charge you in the name of nature to make a day's pause at Mahuntleth where you will find good accommodation and dedicate it to wood nymphs in the silvan scenes I have been describing remembering only to take the horse road to Dolgelthy another place abounding in vegetable beauty The distance from Mahuntleth to the last named town this bridle way is scarcely seven miles not to be complained of with a steed you have faith in and even if the horse had forfeited your confidence fifty times while your eyes escaped you would forgive him for shewing you so many delicious scenes what is better he would annihilate the sense  of danger by making you forget both his errors and those of every body else Do you not perceive that my fancy is again kindling An hazardous time to reenter the woods Is it not to be feared I shall lose myself in them Suppose then I allow myself time to cool before I venture again into this wilderness of sweets It may be as well perhaps for us both Adieu then  LETTER V TO THE SAME  North Wales  AFTER about two hours riding in this charming country you come to a spot so exquisitely delightful that it seems impossible for a poet or a lover whether his mistress is nature or a pretty woman or indeed for any traveller who has enough of romance to keep in motion those passions which like wholesome breezes should always ventilate to prevent the mass from stagnatingIt is in short impossible for any but the sordid worldling not to pause in this place and wish to pass the evening of his days in its vicinity  "Ducere solicita jucunda oblivia vitae"  It is a part of the valley defended by an immense screen of many coloured rocks behind out of which springs here and there a few hardy shrubs and flowers stupendous crags which the hurricanes have thrown from a ridge of mountains whose mutilated heads are still in the clouds Some of these crags have been stopped midway where though they menace a farther descent when assailed by the next storm they have stood the fiege of the elements unmoved for ages Other vast and mishapen masses have found their way to the bottom and lie at the side of the roadto the left of which is a broad stream of water here foaming into natural cascades and there displaying a bason so untroubled and limpid that you languish to bathe in it which you might very securely do for it is in many places so shaded and if you follow the labyrinths will guide you to retreats where losing the foot path you reach a recess where the Graces might bathe without alarm Had Thomson's Musidora chosen this spot she might have  "Stripp'd her beauteous limbs  "To taste the lucid coolness of the flood"  without the least hazard of being surprized by a Damonunless his residence in the neighbourhood gave him knowledge of the secret  hauntor as in Damon's Case he was remarkably fortunate For Damons there are even here I can assure you and Musidoras too amongst the peasantry in particular the swains being as hale happy a set of round faced rosy cheeked youths and the damsels as well featured a race of white toothed blackeyed red lipped lasses as in any part of the world  I should not omit to tell you that the natural cascades and transparent baths before described are so tinted by the refractions of the light and shade and the variegated rocks spars shells c at the bottom that the water itself as well as the flooring if you will give me leave so to call it exhibit all the colours of the rainbow in no less inimitable dies This is a natural beauty I never saw imitated by the painters perhaps the imitation of it is impracticable indeed I do not remember ever to have seen it in nature equally perfect as in this valley Nor is it less worthy note that the foliage of the fine woody mountains that rise above these waterworks of nature in nobly sublime contrast of the no less natural rockwork on the opposite side is not less diversified than the stream The vegetation is of every hue of which green is capable  and an adequate idea of its effect must be as difficult for the pen as the pencil Let it be added that your eye beside the already mentioned beauties takes in the celebrated CaerIdris one of the loftiest of the Welch mountains the summit of which like its famous rivals Snowden and Plinlimmon is covered with eternal snow while numberless flocks of sheep whose fleeces bleached by the wind blowing fresh from the heavens are scarcely less white than that snowfeed frolick and repose on its ample sides The eye aches to view the top of this mountain giant and the brain turns dizzy as it surveys by a sudden transition the depth of the valley below Habit however familiarises both these natural wonders and yet they seem for ever new  My imagination was at work to build just such a comfortable residence on this spot as might hold all those whom I loved and who had taste to share with me its beauties amongst these you my dear friend were not forgotten The above ingenious artist had already consecrated an apartment to you such as must needs have given you content I had allotted another adjoining to yours to our charming friend Mrs L S whose spirit so accords with yours and permit me the flattery of thinking  with my own This pleasant castle in the air went briskly though insensibly forwards as I rode on and the edifice was begun and finished in the most commodious manner possible with all appurtenances thereto belonging such as good fare good furniture good wine and good friends in about a quarter of an hour The herds and flocks that grazed on CaerIdris I had appropriated some fine oxen at feed in the pastures below were with the pastures themselves mine also in short I had fitted up my place fit for the reception of company and began to exult in the work of my own fancy when casting my eyes to the left from that fixed groundloving reverie in which they had been involved during these operations I discovered exactly such a mansion ready made to my hands Consider the state the heat of mind in which I made this discovery and wonder not if in the first moment I fancied I saw only my own edificeIt started to my view precisely when I had given it the last aerial finishes it was embosomed in trees just as I would have it in a word it was to all intents and purposes such as I had been erecting adorning c I need not tell you who know my soliloquizing way that I was sauntering onward all this while"Sometimes fast and sometimes slow" as the poet says  Truly it was a very odd sensation I felt on being obliged at last to confess that it was actually a house of more solid materials than imagination commonly works with How shall I describe this to you I was pleased to see so pretty a villa in so happy a situation as well as to find that others had taste as well as myself but I was a little mortifiedforgive meto perceive any one had as it were built upon  my  ground and superceded me Ye rigid people of the world I pray your pardon Which of you has not erected his airy castle been delighted while it was in progress triumphed in its completion and mourned its fall  My chagrin however was but of a moment I had been sufficiently amused with the shadow and was soon in friendship with the substance I had soon reason to be so The proprietor of this mansion with a child in each hand was standing at his gate He had one of the most inviting countenances I ever saw it encouraged a stranger to begin conversation and to ask any questions with an assurance of their being graciously answered On my first greeting he came down to the road side and with an urbanity that would have graced a court entered with me into discourse On hearing my  eulogy on the beauty of the place and receiving my felicitations on the enviable situation of his villa he begged I would consider myself as the master of it as long as might be agreeable or convenient to me assuring me of the most unfeigned welcome if I could put up with cottagers' fare To strengthen his invitation he observed that the surrounding objects could not possibly be duly seen at one viewthat the colouring of the water its repose its rapidity the contrast of the barren and fertile mountains and of the rocks had different beauties at different times of the day and that after a night's refreshment I should find them far more interesting adding that there were many others which lay out of the common tract in the like style of softness and sublimity and to which he would be himself my conductor in the morning on the condition of my being his guest that night This was offered with so frank an air with so much unquestioned disinterestedness that I intreat of you and your party if you ever take this tour to make your best bows and curtseys to this hospitable cottager His villa is about the midway between Mahuntleth and Dolgelthy but it is impossible it should escape your notice for without these memento's I am sure  here would your foot be fixed and here your heart would warm  Nor is this hospitality rare in this country It anciently you know formed its characteristic Modern manners have not altogether refined it away I witnessed its existence during my tour in a great many instances In taking the exercises of the field for example every farm every cottage is yours as places of repose and refreshment and the bounty extends to your dumb companions as well as to yourselfmilk butter cheese and barakerk oatbread a clean cloth a platter of hungbeef a jugg of beer and a cann of cyder are placed before you as matters of course without asking for and your being a stranger is a sufficient recommendation nay you would be thought cruel to suffer from fatigue hunger or bad weather while such shelter and entertainment was in your reach As this is amongst the facts which a residentiary traveller only could know and as it is really a truth that runs through the country especially the northern parts I feel myself the more bound to mention it Nor is it confined to the low and middle ranks only People of family are every where under a prescriptive necessity of keeping up certain forms but with respect to  Wales a very slight acquaintance with you would secure a most cordial reception in the houses of the gentry and nobility and many of these live in the solid fashions and keep up the good old customs of ancient daysstill retaining their hawker their harper their domestic bard c  A venerable man  Mr Vaughan member for Merionethshire who since this letter was written is dead  member for the very county which supplies the scenes I have been describing may be quoted as an instance His state of health has for some time "check'd the genial current of his soul" but his house has been long the temple of good humour hospitality and cheerfulness in a stile that might put to the blush the proud reserves and selfish pomps of upstart greatness and mushroom pretensions to state and distinctions  Such in very general expressions are the farmers peasants and gentry of the country which gives a title to the Heir Apparent of one of the most valuable crowns and to one of the most accomplished Princes in the Christian world It were devoutly to be wished that with equal truth I could pay an  equal tribute to the peasantry farmers and gentry in England but I fear the unbought disinterested urbanity of these to strangers whether of their own country or of any other must be looked upon rather as exceptions than general rules When I reflect upon the substantial charities and benevolence of the people of England on all great occasions I triumph in being myself an Englishman but I shall cease to regret my friend that in the spontaneous courtesies the little impromptu's of civility that grow out of the wants and wishes of the moment and are to be gratified by dispensing with all formal reserves tedious introductions and suspicious balancings the Welch the Scotch the Irish the French and many other people are their superiors  Whence can this take its rise Is it pride distrust an apprehension of being deluded Is it an insular kind of reservation A shutting up of the heart till it is woo'd and won Or is it a mixture of all these Whatever be the cause the effect is to be deplored for much pleasure is lost to him who has too much etiquette fear or dignity to stoop to immediate occurrences the opportunity of doing a kindness is lost in a moment and if our doors are to be opened only to receive a friend  and a stranger must bring credentials of his being entitled to the en passant benevolence by being known to some of our friends or neighbours though unknown to ourselves a thousand urbanities which might have been shewn must be omitted A temper betwixt the extremes of French officiousness and English phlegm would form a good middle character From many observations daring my late intercourse amongst all ranks in this country I am disposed to think that Welch courtesy is the happy medium so far as goes to the reception of and good offices shewn to strangers The fire of the French at first fight is too hot to last the frost of the English takes too much time in thawing and though their bounty is but the more solid and effectual when the ice of their constitutionalperhaps only atmospherical reserve is dissolved like certain fruits of the earth after the snow that long covered them is melted the occasion is past away and the object that stood in need of our temporary exertions may have gone even beyond the reach of our best services while the fires of benevolence are kindling Not but I know many happy exceptions amongst which I should not scruple were I called upon by way of challenge to produce a native  of the gloomy island as foreigners sometimes call it who to peculiar tenderness of the affections for particular and private friends unites a large and indeed universal philanthropy the effect of which extends courtesy gentleness and generous actions to people of all nations dispensing kind words and good deeds wherever they are implored I should name yourselfand not without exultation that I have the honour to be your friend Adieu  P S I shall leave the northern and return to the southern part of Wales tomorrow with intent to take a little seabathing before I entirely quit the country I will give you the rest of my Gleanings from the court of Neptune  LETTER VI TO THE SAME  Barmouth North Wales  I HAVE as the date will shew you altered my route to which I have been induced by a wish to pay my parting tribute to the place from which I now address you The road from Mahuntleth to Dolgelthy I trust my last has made you acquainted with that from Dolgelthy to Barmouth a space only of ten miles can like the other be done full justice to only by your own eyes for its beauties are so manifold and extraordinary that they literally "beggar description" Suppose yourself mounted on your horse or seated in your carriage on a clear genial day as able from health as disposed from taste and temper to enjoy the beauties that offer themselves to your view Under these happy circumstances these ten miles would be the shortest and the most pleasant you have past in your whole life New pastures of the most exuberant sertility new woods rising in the majesty of foliage the road itself curving in numberless unexpected directions at one moment shut into a verdant recess so contracted that there seems neither  carriage or bridle way out of it at another the azure expanse of the main ocean filling your eyeon one side of you rocks glittering in all the colours of that beauty which constitutes the sublime and of an height that diminishes the wild herds that browse or look down upon you from the summits where the largest animal appears insignificantly minuteon the other hand plains villas cottages venerable halls or copses with whatever tends to form that milder grace that belongs to the beautiful Such are some of the objects you will meet with in your excursion to Barmouth on your arrival at which place so far from your prospects terminating with your journey they open upon you fresh attractions which are as singular as unexpected  This little seaport consists of one irregular street only one side of which is built upon the solid rocky mountain that is of so stupendous an height that the first view of it upon the traveller's entrance into the village or taken from the seaside makes him not only tremble for himself but for the aerial inhabitants out of that mountain rock are their habitations formed and though the consistence is rather weak than strong as after much drought or rain it will crumble under your feet as you  tread on it the houses are in excellent repair and seem like those that reside in them to set winds and waves at defiance The villagers are probably more hardy than their native mountainsmuch more so I should judge than their crumbling rocks if their weather beaten complexions and hard hands which in my familiar characterexploring way I have sometimes shakenmay be considered as samples You seem to be caressing a man of iron and that iron appears to be covered with a leather that has undergone the process and taken the tan of the material with which our English waggon whips are commonly made The chief food of the peasantry is fish which is had in the greatest abundance and it may be reckoned amongst the pleasant objects of the place to see the natives in their little fishing boats on a fine morning when the sea is calm If you look at them from the rocky side of the village the boats seem like buoys and the people that guide them are scarcely perceptible The village itself viewed on the contrary from the ocean is the most picturesque you can imagine On account of the excellence of the beach it is an admirable watering place and a good bath may be had almost every day In tempestuous weather the assemblage of objects are taken together the  most sublime of any in the principality The dark shading and stupendous height of these rocks which overhang the ocean the mountain billows that ascending midway dash against them as if disappointed in their ambition to reach the summitThe vessels that seem crouding into the harbour and almost taking shelter in the houses upon the beach The buildings on the rocks meanwhile seeming to demand no protection but to mock the stormthe innumerable quantity of seabirds that enjoy it all these go towards the sceneryand if thunder and lightning are added to it which are very frequent accompaniments the reverberation of the sound amongst the rocks the terrific charms of the flashes on the objects both on sea and shore with the intermingled roar of the waves finish the climax if I may so call it of the true sublime You may perhaps ask if this scenery is not in every mountainous country near the sea pretty much the same I answer certainly in a degree but it is the  superlative  degree of awful grandeur you find in this place and all I have hitherto seen of the magnificence of nature in the time of her trouble has been comparatively feeble to her exhibitions in and about Barmouth  But it is time that I bring both you and myself safe down from these Alps of Cambria where you may perhaps think I have staid with you too long particularly when the black mountains were wrapt in storm and the nature of the surrounding objects made me in danger of becoming poetical which is a rock worse to the sober minded reader than any I have mentioned yet on which too many travellers split Nevertheless I have only cropp'd a few of the flowers which others failed to gather In traversing a spacious garden even with avowed intent of forming a bouquet it is impossible amidst a profusion of sweets bestowed in "the prodigality of nature" not to leave or overlook many flowerets and particular spots of exquisite beauty and fragrance To pluck and to examine these and occasionally to borrow from others what may be honourable to them in the repetition as authors and agreeable to you as a reader is the "head and front" of my office as a Gleaner  From the labours of the late Mr Grosse you and every reader of taste are so well acquainted with the abbeys castles and other reliques of that time and of the time of more destructive men in the shapes of Kings Protectors c who like death "put all things under their feet"  that I shall not attempt to reconduct you to these remains of power priestcraft and superstition Indeed were I inclined to search diligently it is doubtful whether I should be able to pick up a single ruin that accurate antiquarian having left nothing for my gleaning Neither shall I say any thing of Snowden nor ask you to accompany me to the country where  "Huge Plinlimmon rears his cloud topp'd head"  both of which have been introduced to you in the best manner by Mason and Gray the latter of whom possessed a genius loftier and more sublime than the mountains he described  A few objects however  nearer the ground  remain for me and if you will condescend to accept such humble offerings after the giddy heights and fearful precipices from which I have just let you down they are at your service A quiet walk in the valley after clambering hills and buffeting with storms may relieve you  Suppose therefore by way of shewing you a specimen of the hardy manner in which the poor natural inhabitants of these craggy abodes live you step with me into a hut belonging to one of the Barmouth peasants In point of  situation it might vie with any hermitage cot or palace that priest peasant or prince ever fixed on for residence A noble beach of the finest sand spreads itself at the bottom the ocean yet nobler extends in front with all the scenery that moves on the face of the waters the cliffs of Cardiganshire bounds the prospect to the right to the left are seen those of Caernarvonshire Close at its foot a rill which is for ever heard but never seen the shrub wood and weeds of a little halfcultivated piece of garden ground bidding defiance to the most narrow inspection and close at its back is part of that immense and continuous rock on which one half of the village is erected but as those are on the summit this is at the bottom The sides and far the greater part of this hovel for it is little better are so thick with ivy that at a small distance nothing but that romantic evergreen is to be discovered A novel writer or a lover or a misanthrope could imagine nothing half so congenial to their pensive dispositions it belongs to neither of these personages Enter it and survey the inhabitants Perhaps there never was contained in so small a space such a variety of occupations going on at the same time nor probably such a number of living beings crouded into one cottage consisting not only  of one floor but one very contracted room That room was built barn fashion had more light from the large gaps in the roof which was of thatch than from the window Its walls are of avowed mud for not so much as a common white wash ever attempted to conceal their real composition The family consisted of fourteen persons of which three were too young to relieve their poverty though just old enough to smile at and disregard itthe rest were as I said busily employed The father of the family was making nets the mother of it was shaving one of the innkeepers of the placeof her more anonthe eldest son was weaving ribbonsthe eldest daughter weaving cloththe second son was mending a petticoat that for variety of patchwork might triumph over Otway's Hagthe second daughter was attempting to repair what I guess might have been intended for her father's breeches in his younger days and was now to be converted into a pair for his heir apparentthe third daughter he had but three sons was combing the head of the fourth who was with no less industry knitting a pair of stockingsthe sixth girl was making bread the seventh was making broth that is a collection of potatoes carrots and other vegetablesand the eighth and last was rocking  the cradle of the youngest child with her foot and dandling another in her armswhile the fifth was making first experiments at the spinning wheel  The tatters which were thrown over these poor artizans were even more bare and ragged than the furniture which consisted of only three miserable beds of which one only had curtains and those of yellow stuff in so ruinous a state that as the Copper Captain says of the ratsthe moths and other vermin "had instinctively quitted it"There was a fourth bed of a little dirty looking straw in a corner of the room with a covering of old sacks Never did I see so much indigence and so much industry united for though the latter was unremitted the low price of labour and the number to be supplied from it and the tender years of most of the labourers made the source inadequate to the demand upon it but neither the industry nor the indigence had banished the virtues or the felicities They were indeed within this lowly residence in a more flourishing state than is generally to be found in prouder dwellings All the varieties which characterise happiness in different minds and ages were presented before me The father while he constructed his net taught the alphabet  to one of his smaller children who was armed with an hornbookThe matron strongly recommended the last piece of cloth of her eldest girl's making to the innkeeper whose chin she was reaping thus contriving to carry on two bargains at the same time and it is not easy to describe to you the satisfaction with which the good man of the house kissed the dirty face of the child on her getting through her letters without miscalling or forgetting more than sixteen out of the twentyfour or how the good woman chuckled when her encomia of the linen conquered the reluctance of mine host who not only promised to become a purchaser of the cloth then under hand but to speak favourably of her daughter's handyworks to the gentry at his house The joke however which was meanwhile carrying on between the second son and daughter about the  inversion  of their usual occupations which was a thing agreed on out of pure sport supplied a mirth yet more ardent The convention was "Sister if you will repair my breeches I will mend your petticoatOne good turn deserves another" Accordingly both went to work during which a thousand rustic repartees and sallies of uncultivated wit which made up in harmlessness what they wanted in brilliancy passed in reboundbut  the jet of the joke lay in a struggle that happened between them in the progress of their business the brother declaring his sister was a bungler whereupon there arose a pleasant contention which was of serious consequence to the breeches for they were torn in twain and furthermore so rent as to be unfit for either father or son this though no trifling loss to a family under such circumstances made the jest so much the better that the father forgave the misfortune for the sake of the pleasant manner with which it was brought about assuring me that there was more wit in that girl who had torn the breeches and more slyness in the young dog that was laughing at it than I could believe The mother shook her head saying they were always at some mischief and would be the ruin of the family but patted the girl on the cheek and clapped the boy on the back while she passed the censure on them Thus does the tenderness of nature administer equivalents for the poverty of her meanest offspring The rest of the family were no less successful in mixing amusement with business The little stockingknitter was telling to the bread maker a story of the lights being seen and the groans heard when there was no person to carry the one or to make the otherA superstition by the bye  that is interesting to children of a larger growth than those who were then listening to it of which in its place The little cradlerocker was singing a lullaby to the suckling which was hugging an half starved kitten in its arms Find me a family at once so happy and numerous my friend When the innkeeper was gone I sat down in the shaving chair and from that day have never ceased to wish there was at least one female barber in every town I passed through This however with another at Mahuntleth were the only ones I ever met with in my life and both of them beat the men at a beard all to nothing  I trust that you who I know are delighted with the sight of "happy human faces" wherever they can be seen will not be displeased at my having taken you into this humble abode It may serve to shew you as a specimen the chearful and incessant labours of the industrious poor for there are very many of this description in Wales and they are the more meritorious as though there is infinite poverty there is scarcely any appearance of it in the whole principality it being a general almost an universal principle of the rich to take care of the poora principle which like every other good is often abused For the  number of common beggars throughout every part of Wales is astonishing they come in tattered tribes to your doors from which they never go away if they have no worse faults than idleness and indigence without being relieved It would even be thought impious to refuse them Profiting hereby there are whole families who subsist solely on the charity of their better supplied neighbours The begging brotherhood of Saint Francis are not more vagrant nor more successful in their mendicatory pilgrimages and it is not uncommon for the parents who happen to have some compunction on the score of asking alms while they are able to procure the means of life by their labour to send out their children to shift as they can while they themselves are at work preferring this casual and disgraceful mode of subsistence for their children to the honest industry by which they procure their own maintenance There is however as you may suppose a material difference even in the poverty of the industrious and that of the idle the former as in the example of the barber of Barmouth covering the shoulders of his family with  remnants  which although  "Coarsely  patch'd  with different colour'd rags  "Green red blue white yellow"  certainly speak "variety of  industry"  while the latter though they are neither ashamed to beg nor steal and of course get their cloaths with much less trouble suffer them to get into tatters merely because they are too lazy to mend them before they are irreparable My friend the barber indeed valued himself on his true British blood very seriously asserting that notwithstanding his present condition he was the first of his family that had ever gained his bread by the sweat of the brow and that his father sacrificed the estate which ought to have descended to his posterity to an act of generosity to the  unfortunate Prince  meaning the Pretender who he added pointing to an almost worn out print of him that hung on the wall was more obliged to his father and better deserved it than he dared tell me Not continued he but I am a true friend and loyal subject to his Majesty King George but that poor Princeagain pointing to the printwas a disappointed outcast man wandering up and down this country and I am proud that my father opened his door to him though he let out at the same time what pluckt up the hopes of his family by the roots Hereby hangs a sorrowful tale master said he sighing but it is of no use to trouble you with it and as for me it is but doing something  instead of nothing for my living which is all the difference you know Sir betwixt a poor man and a gentleman so work away my lads and lasses work away old Dame Partlet for as the song says  "The world is a wellfurnish'd table  "Where guests are promiscuously set"  sung the mother of the family continuing the tune  "We all fare as well as we are able"  carolled the eldest daughter who had really a fine voice  "And scramble for what we can get"  chorus boys and girls chorusHere the rest of the labourers took up the burthen and the "long loud laugh" succeeded which not only "spoke the vacant" but the happy soul I joined in it with all my heart and resolved to recommend as many customers as I could to the independent cottagers And I hereby beg they may be had in remembrance whenever either you or your friends emigrate to this part of the world and should want either nets shaving in the easiest manner homespun ribbons homeknit stockings petticoats repaired or breeches destroyed Adieu  LETTER VII TO THE SAME  South Wales  I HAVE now resumed my southern route and write to you from Aberestwith in my way to which I met with another little cottage enterprise that is so descriptive of that happiness in the most lowly stations of life of which people in the affluent or even the middle ranks of this variegated world have no manner of idea that I cannot but imagine a relation of it will be welcome to  you  whom I know to delight in viewing all sides of the human picture particularly such as represent any part of the happiness of human beings  You are yet to learn that I performed and am still performing this Cambrian expedition upon the back of my old faithful steed now in the twentyfourth year of his age a creature the best calculated of all others for the purposes of a deliberate and residentiary traveller having every disposition in the world to allow his master time for observation and reflection His character is very truly given in the words of the good old axiom"slow and sure" His own history is sufficiently interesting and eventful to find a place in a heart like your's and  in abridgement I will here give it you The whole life of this poor slave till within the two last years has been a continued trial of strength labour and patience He was broken to the bit by a Yorkshire jockey to be rode the moment he was fit for service by an Oxonian scholar who whatever might have been his learning in the abstruser sciences was little conversant in the rudiments of humanity though they are level with the lowest understanding and founded on the tender code of that great Lawgiver who has told us "a just man is merciful to his beast" During the very first vacation this sprightly youth so completely outrode the strength of his steed that he sold him on the same day that he regained his college at the recommencement of the term for two guineas to one of those persons who keep livery stables and at the same time have horses to let It was not easily possible for a poor wretch so badly situated before to change so much for the worse and of all the fates that attend a hackney horse that which belongs to the drudge of a public university is the most servere it is even harder than that of the servitors of the college He remained in this servitude however sixteen years during which he was a thousand times not only priestridden but parish ridden and yet was rarely  known to stumble and never to fall Is it not questionable whether half the parishioners or even the priests with reverence be it spoken could say as much for their  own  travels in the rugged journey of life His master rather from policy than compassion thought it most for his suture interest to allow his fourfooted servant a short respite and he was accordingly favoured with a month's run in what is called a salt marsh but before his furlow was expired he was  borrowed  by some smugglers who then infested the coast and who made him the receiver of contraband commodities as well as aider and abetter in practices which like many other underhand actions are best carried on in the night time I say  borrowed  because after a winter's hard work in the company of these landpirates the horse was thrown up by his temporary employers in the very marsh out of which he had been pressed into their service and a leathern label on which was marked this facetious intelligence fastened to his fetlock  Owner I have been smuggled  By these means he unexpectedly came again into his quondam master's possession out of which however he departed the summer after in the society of an old fellow commoner who after many years close confinement in the cloisters was disposed to relinquish them in favour of a  piece of church preferment in Norfolk which happened to be in the gift of a lady about his own standing in life and who in the days of her youth avowed so strong a partiality for this gentleman that her father disapproving her alliance with a person who had only the hopes of a curacy before his eyes thought fit to clog her inheritance over which he had complete authority with a formidable condition of forfeiting the whole estates should she marry a son of the church shutting out hereby the whole body of divinity to exclude the aforesaid individual member Faithful however to the merits of the man who had won her heart she was glad to find that the parental tyranny which had tied her hand had left free her fortune she therefore took the first opportunity to present the object of her early choice with the only piece of service in her powera presentation to the living of which she was become the patroness thinking this a better evidence of her still existing partiality than if she had set fortune at defiance and sacrificed not only her own advantages but her lover's to gratifying a passion which would have impoverished both An example of tenderness this well worthy the imitation of more romantic minds It was to be inducted to this living our learned clerk now journeyed on the ancient steed  whose memoirs I am now writing and as he did not intend to revisit the banks of Isis and had often been securely carried to a neighbouring chapel where he officiated on the back of this identical horse he purchased him to the intent that he should get into a good living also But the turbulent part of this poor brute's adventures was not yet performed His patron died without himself deriving what might have been expected from his benefice and soon after the decease of the master the servant fell into the hands of a man in the same parish who to a variety of other endeavours to subsist a large and needy family added that of letting out occasionally a horse Our hero still unbroken in either knees or constitution was deemed fit for his purpose and being thought of little value was obtained at an easy price His new master removed soon after to Lowestoft which you know is a considerable seabathing town in the county of Suffolk where the toils imposed by his Oxford tyrant were more than accumulated for besides dragging a cart all the morning with loads of bread a baker being amongst the businesses of his master he was on account of his gentle disposition the horse fixed upon to take a couple of gouty invalids in the bathing machine after the more vigorous divers  and dippers had finished their ablutions In the afternoon he was harnessed to the London postcoach which daily past from Lowestoft to Yarmouth The next morning by daybreak he came with the return of the said coach and was then ready for the diurnal rotation at home unless a more profitable offer happened to take him another way Four years of his life were passed in this miserable round of labours and it was at this period of his history he and I became acquainted I was then on a visit to one of the  The venciable translator of Sophocles Eschylus and Euripides  best scholars and men in the world and being in want of a little horse exercise my friend mentioned to me this poor but honest slave recounting to me at the same time what I have now dilated of his story adding that he did not exactly know in what condition he might be at that time but that he could answer for what was left of him to be good which is much more than can fairly be said of a third of those who are nearly worn out in the business of the world  My affections were engaged and I was predetermined to make a present to them of this horse for a sight of which I immediately sent my servant but when he was led to the door of my friend's house and though my resolution  to mark him for my own grew firmer as I gazed upon his pitymoving carcase I totally gave up all ideas of his utility The owner himself confessed he was almost done up at which thought a long sigh ensued and a confession that he had been the chief support of the family observing while he patted his neck that the poor fellow might be said not only to carry his children's bread to be sold but to make itBut it's all over with you now my old boycontinued the bakeryou may get me through the autumn mayhap and then What then said I He must hobble away to the kennelTo the kennel Even so masterWhat must be must be I can't afford to let him die by inches and if I could I don't see the humanity of that better give him to the dogs while they can make a meal of him and pay me a small matter for their entertainmentHe will however carry your honour this month to come creditably  Predetermined as I said to spare the remains of this poor wretch I bought him on the spot convinced that it would be difficult to find any other person who would receive him on any terms His appearance was such as would have justified Rosinante in refusing his acquaintance on the etiquette of comparative poverty The association would have disgraced  that celebrated spectre nor did Quixote himself exhibit so woeful a countenance If ever therefore I could boast of an action purely disinterested and which had unalloyed compassion for its basis it was the giving five times more than he was worth that is to say five guineas for this old horse intending only at the time that he should pass the residue of his days in peaceful indolence broke in upon by the infirmities of life and die a natural death To this end I obtained him the run of a friend's park where I considered him as a respectable veteran retired on a pension In this verdant hospital he remained unsought unseen a whole year at the end of which being invited to pass the Christmas with the noble and generous owners of the park aforesaid I paid a visit also to my pensioner who had grown so much beyond himself on their unmeasured bounty that he seemed to be renovated Do not wonder that I scarce knew him in his improvements for he appeared not to know himself The poor fellow's very character was inverted the alteration reached from head to heel he neighed snorted kicked and frolicked about the pasture on my first attempt to stop him with the airs of a fillyfoal I reminded him that he ought to deport more humbly considering the melancholy  situation from which he was but recently delivered yet so far from paying any attention he turned from my morality with another snort of disdain tossed up his saucy head and threw up his heels wholly forgetting like other ingrates his former condition Like them too he appeared to consider the world now made for him and therefore betwixt jest and earnest I was resolved once more to shew him he was made for the world  The very next day I caused him to be taken from his green recess and performed the tour of the environs on his back More airily more pleasantly I could not have been carried nor towards the end of the ride more soberly The spirit which he shewed in the pastures was but as the levities of a hearty and happy old age in the plenitude of uncurbed leisure like the gaiety of a veteran who finding himself in health might take it into his head to finish in a country dance but these are sallies for a moment Ah my friend how many poor starving wretches worn down by their cruel taskmasters goaded like this horse by the "whips and spurs of the time" and driven out of one hard service to another might like him be rescued in the extremity at small expence and by the hand of bounty be protected  from farther rigours even till they were renewed for a serviceable instead of a diseased old age How many halffamished hardridden creatures of the human race I say might in like manner be replenished Reject not this long storythis episodethis heroicomiepic if you pleasebut I cannot allow you to call it a digression You will admit it to be in point when you are given to understand that on this very horse thus restored by a little indulgence I have measured a thousand miles and find my associate in sufficient heart to measure a thousand more On the fourandtwentieth year of his age we sallied forth and if the master had in course of his travels made as few trips as few false steps as the servant he might be a match for the safest goer on the road of life  Should this correspondence reach the professional critics think you that I should "scape calumny" for taking up so much of their time about an old horse And why should I not pay an old faithful companion to whom I owe much health much happiness this grateful effusion If the Rosinante of Cervantes had more wit the cat of Montaigne more wisdom and the afs of Yorick more sentiment none of them could be better qualified as I before told  you for a deliberate traveller He was in short may he is being at this very minute at feed before methe horse in the world for a  Gleaner  A month's close connexion and converse with each other before I set out on this tour in little experimental excursions gave him such an insight into my habits that we perfectly understood one another by the time we set out on our northern expedition He follows me when I wish to be a foot waits for me at a gate or hedge without tying when I imagine there is any thing Gleanworthy out of the main road and when as is my custom I sit down to make minutes of my observations or luxuriate on the scenery around me although he has never discovered any remarkable relish for these sort of banquets he contents himself with picking a dinner from the grass on the road side or if this  agrément  is wanting he takes a comfortable nap as he stands and leaves me to my reflections after which though often roused suddenly he wakes in the sweetest temper in the world and is perhaps the only companion a traveller of my disposition could go a long journey with and not be extremely complained of I have sometimes set out at early dawn with the intention of travelling even in my sauntering way at least twenty miles but the beauty of the day  the abundance of the objects and a frame of mind to enjoy them has with diffiendty permitted me to reach the first village town or cottagefor I stop any where and am at home every where Where is the man or woman who would find this supportable Where is even the beast who would not think it a little troublesome I never however saw my poor old fellow even look as if he had less patience or philosophy than myself And shall not such a horse for once in my life be made the chief subject of a letter How many worse topics have filled folios Forgive me my friend I would not build a palace for him were I as rich as Caligula but I would under your auspices dedicate to him this part of my present epistle assuring you if in my correspondence you find any spirit novelty sport or information as you flatter me you do the meek pliability of this aged thing had his share in producing it As to the critics should I come under their lash for the trespass I shall only beg them as they value their own hobbyhorses and love to praise them to boast how well they carry and how much safer and better they go through this dirty world than their neighbours to bear this once with the history of mine But I promised you another cottage  adventure which this history has thus long postponed You shall have it now  In effect it was a reflection on the grotesque situation to which both man and horse were reduced that brought upon you this curious morsel of equestrian biography I set off from a lone house on a sandy heath very properly called the barren island about a mile on the Aberestd with side of Aberavon where I had passed a stormy night rendered yet more troublous by there being every hour brought to the FerryHouse the dead bodies of sishermen who had perished in a tempest which a few nights before had wrecked a number of vessels on the coast of Wales It was the season of the herring fishery in progress of which there are many misfortunes of this sort and of other kinds for a bad season or which is tantamount bad luck will ruin a whole family sometimes a whole village the sole dependence of which are the herrings the staple commodity of the inhabitants At the time of my quitting the barren island the clouds made the fairest promises and a beautiful rainbow stretched its arch across the heavens to confirm them but I had not gone a league before all these fair promises were broken and I was drenched to  the skin notwithstanding my horse did the best in his power for both our sakes to prevent it  We took shelter at a most miserable looking hut at the side of the heath and accepted the protection it offered with as entire good will as if it had been an eastern palace My horse was obliged to crawl into a kind of outhouse where a swine driver and his pigs had the instant before taken refuge and while I was reconciling my steed to this society a Jew pedlar and his pack and another traveller with his dog crouded in Necessity as Shakspeare says brings one acquainted with strange company not that these are the words of that immortal Bard and of course my memory has injured even the sentiment but you who have literally his works by  heart  can do him justice  A being scarcely human in appearance invited me to enter the hut I enter'd Its inhabitantsHow shall I describe them Fancy something which assembles the extremes of filth penury health and felicity personify these amongst men women and childrengive to each of them forms and features which confer a sort of grace and  beauty on the household of the barber of Barmouth by comparison Put all this filth penury health and felicity into motion and having formed your groupe imagine that you see it unshod unstockinged uncapped and nearly unpetticoated and unbreeched Young and old were busied in counting the finest and freshest herrings I ever saw that instant brought in from the fishingboat The father of the family to whom the boat belonged declared he had never had so prosperous a voyage and though he was almost blown away he would hazard twice as much danger for such another drag look what a size they are of and how they shine my boys and girls i'faith they seem'd plaguily afraid of the hurricane and came in shoals to the nets as if they took shelter in themlittle thinking poor fools that this was a jump from the water to the fire and now I talk of that here put half a dozen of them into the pan for I am deuced hungry and mayhap this gentleman may be so too and if so be that he is he shall be as welcome to a fresh herring and a brown biscuit as myselfWhat say you my heart of oak continued he clapping me as familiarly on the shoulder as if I had been his messmate and indeed treating me as hospitably as if I had been so and we had both escaped from a  wreck to his cabin Perceiving my dripping situation he said "Come shipmate doff your jacket put on this rug come to an anchor in that corner warm your shivering timbers with a drop of this dear creature which will make a dead fish speak like an oratorthereanother swigdon't be afraid of itone moreand now you will do while your rigging and canvass are drying  All this time mine host of the hovel stood in his seadrench'd apparel on my reminding him of which he cried out smilingly Ah you are a freshwater farlor I perceive and would take a deal of seasoning before you were good for any thing but for me all winds and weathers are alike to old Jack while I can get good fish abroad and good flesh at home so fry away Molly for the wet has made me as hungry as a snark and though I have drank like a whale I shall now eat like a lionand I hope you will do the same messmate By this time mine hostess set before us our dish of herrings which with oatmeal cakes potatoes and buttermilk furnished one of the heartiest dinners I ever ate after which the sailor made me partaker of a can of flipsung a song about the dangers and hardships of the seafaring life and made me take notice that he was  the happy father of a cabin full of children that I might see another was upon the stocks and that if it pleased God to send him a dozen such pieces of good fortune every year for a dozen seasons he should be as able as he was willing to procure a snug birth for every one and meantime master we will have another sip of grog to drink success to the herring fishery  Our regale was interrupted by the sudden exclamations from without doors of  She's lost she's lostshe can't weather itshe must go to the bottomthere is not water enough for her to come in and the wind blows like the devil in her teethshe's sinkingthe next sea will finish her  All the cottagers ran to the beach which was within a few paces I followed instinctively The hurricane was again renewed the seas ran mountain high and a small coasting vessel was struggling with them In a few minutes the strand was covered with spectators but not idle ones The whole of the villagers hurried to give assistance Amongst the croud I discovered both the pig driver and the pedlar whose situation I had begun to relate to my kind hearted host but the most assiduous of the whole multitude was a young woman who  while the tears ran down her cheeks was amidst the first to leap into a small boat which had been anchored on the beach and in which the master of our cottage and three others resolved to trust themselves to offer such assistance as was in their power The wind did not abate of its fury but shifted a few points more inshore this perhaps in a vessel of greater burthen might have been fatal but was in some sort favourable to the little bark in distress She had by tacking gained a station parallel to a part of the harbour where she might run ashore which she did at length without much damage and the only thing now to be apprehended was the loss of the boat that had gone out to her succour The people on board the vessel were almost instantly on land and one of them being shewn the boat and told at the same time that she went out to the relief of the crew was amongst the boat and told at the same time that she went out to the relief of the crew was amongst the most active to throw out a rope and try to return the favour intended him in kind The same circumstance however which brought in the vessel presently befriended the boat who venturing to set her sail was after a few desperate rolls impelled over the billows and driven as it were headlong on shore but not before the sailor who had been handing out the rope perceived the female in the boat  on which he threw himself to the ground in the eagerness of catching her in his arms You already feel they were lovers they were more The bands of matrimony had united them the week before The very fishing boat which was now driven on shore was the mutual property of the two fathers who had agreed to give up each his share to their son and daughter as the wedding portion two of the men in the little skiff were the fathers the profits of the herring season were to be the childrens fortune How thin are the bounds that separate the extremes of happiness from the excesses of misery The former however were now realized the vessel brought in a good freight the fathers were saved and the children were happy They all resided and were indeed natives of the village but mine host whose house was nearest to the place of landing and had a heart sufficiently expanded to fill a palace with people that stood in need of hospitality insisted that as soon as the Little Sally and Jack which it seems was the name of the fishingboat could be left for half an hour they should pass it with him this being agreed to all hands went to work upon the Little Sally and Jack and if I had not been apprehensive that my ignorance in what was to be done would rather have confused  than assisted my poor  id should not have been withhold Matters being put to rights and less mischief done than might have been expected the company set off for the hut of my generous host who took a hand of each of the married lovers walking between them and told them he hoped that as they had so well escaped Davy's Locker this time they would tumble in a hammock together these fifty years A fresh supply of fish was immediately ordered into the pan my landlord swearing a terrible oath that on this occasion for there was a strict friendship between him and the parties preserved the old saying should be verified as to their swimming thrice accordingly for their second ocean it was determined that the bowl which some years before had commemorated an escape from a shipwreck in his own fortunes should now be filled to the brim to celebrate the success of the Little Sally and Jack I was pressed to stay and take my share on pain of being deemed too proud to be happy amongst poor people and on observing that my steed all this time was in a state which reproached me for faring so sumptuously he started up declaring that though he could not ride he loved a horse next to a man and that if mine would put up with a mess of bran instead  of hay of which he had none and a draught of ale instead of water he should be as welcome as his own soul I took him at his word and staid to witness and join in the festivities till there was just enough of the evening left to reach Aberestdwith I would have offered a small token of acknowledgment for what I had received but that I saw a tremendous frown gathering on the brow of my host and an oath quivering on his lip which frightened me from my design and made me only take his hand with an assurance that I would never pass his house without stopping to see if all was well on board and how the herring fishery succeeded This so pleased him that he made the bowl go around to my health and wishing another gale of wind would blow me into his hovel as often as I should come along side of it then led out my horse held my stirrup while I mounted and huzza'd me in three hearty cheers till I was out of sight  My dear friend how fallacious how contracted are our judgments on that part of human nature which we have not had opportunities of seeing and which therefore we too often suppose does not exist We lay much of what are called the courtesies civilities and  interesting humanities to the account of education we conceive that to enlarge the human heart we should refine it in short we are extremely apt to circumscribe elevated action to elevated life or at best to consider the nobler effusions when they proceed from low born and uncultured men as exceptions to a general sordidness and vulgar way of  feeling  as well as thinking You will not suspect me of an overfondness for what is termed low company the error of my life perhaps is to have past too much of it in the society of what is called high company for what commonly speaking does it shew us but the smooth shillings that Sterne has so finely described as rubbing out all character and impression in the act of polishing I love however to mix with and as it were blend myself in all ranks and orders of mento see converse with and weave myself into their most familiar habitudes and as I never yet could bring any other person exactly into the same way of thinking I have pursued this inclination for the most part  alone  till by long usage solitary travelling though I trust you will allow me to be of a social disposition is become agreeable to me And suffer me to say that I think I have derived from this very singularity a more thorough insight into nature the hearts  and manners of human kind than if I had gone the grand tour in what is denominated the  best company  By means of my humbler but less encumbered mode of travelling I am as free to observe what is passing as the birds that fly over my head like them I stop to amuse myself with a song regale myself with gleaning what I feel to be solid food but which grew up in places where another traveller would not go to look for it like them I enjoy the blazing hearth and partake the crumbs of the peasant or pause to observe upon the magnificence and luxuries of the prince I pass in rapid transitions from one to the other In a circuitous way revisit the places I have left renew my acquaintance with particular persons and places glean the characters and hearts of the poor and the rich break in upon them unawares open the path by no former notices which gives folks time to put on the mask of the world and receive me in disguiseI love to take them by surprize and so discover my welcome It delights me to lift the latch of a cottage such for instance as I have been describing towards nightfall and to see the hearts of the inhabitants fly out suddenly to greet me And to treat my friends in higher life in like mannerto steal into their familiar family rooms unexpectedly  and almost unseen at hours they are most likely to be gathered together When a year's absence is expected it delights me to cut it short sometimes to cut it in halfsometimes even in quartersCan there be any thing more pleasant to the traveller who has luckily  "The world before him where to choose"  than to see the countenances of a whole family of whatever condition and of whatever country for what points or boundaries of earth or water can set limits to a temper that cultivates the kind the good and the ingenious wherever it meets themto see I say the countenances of such lighten up at your sudden appearance and each person contributing to your welcomeone offering "the ready chair" another refreshment c c and thus as I said feeling yourself at home with the worthy and hospitable in all countries I protest to you that I bear a goodwill bordering on friendship for even the trees or hedgerows that have formerly afforded me shade in summer or shelter such as they had to bestow in winter and I do not pass them bye in my returns without a smile and sometimes a nod of acknowledgment  Am I exhibiting traits of an humourist in all this Be it so if they serve to keep me  in spite of many vexations from the world in humour with  it  if they open my eyes to the beauties of nature and my heart to the author of them if in the cultivation of new friendships they help me to forget or forgive at least old enmities if in a word they enable me to draw both from solitude and society those satisfactions which though unfelt or unknown to others are extremely appreciated by me would you wish me to forego them in complaisance to those who think they are  right on  travellers and I a mere idler by the way because we perform our journeythe same short journey alas with respect to human life in a different manner and with different degrees of expedition as well as by different roads No You have too much philosophy too much toleration too much affection about you not to let every man amuse himself in his travels through life in his own way and with respect to myself you would be in friendship with the most inanimate objectswith a clown that opened the door of his hut to me but for an hour amidst the Appenines to lighten the toils of ascending them or with the simplest shrubs that saved me but a minute from the "pitiless storm" in the deserts of Arabia  In return every thing that contributes to your ease comfort or happiness is interesting to your friend and were you to tell me that a poor sparrow that sat on your housetop gave you pleasure to have him amongst your domestics I must mourn the fate which should bring that sparrow to the ground  How have I been seduced into these delineations of myself I know not But I remember that they grew out of an apology I was making for stopping so frequently on the road going backwards and forwards so irregularly and vindicating the humble companions amongst whom I every now and then throw myself  In the course of our correspondence you have had reason I trust to approve of the pauses I have made in the most lowly dwellings At the last resting place for example did I not bring you acquainted with a set of as humane openhearted sincere industrious and innocent creatures as ever struggled with the winds and waves for a subsistence Exposed to the most furious elements do you not feel that the gentlest and the best are mixed up in their compositions even while their lives are passed in the rudest occupations Do you  not see that the hardest hands and the softest hearts belong frequently to the same persons Is not hospitality good faith good neighbourhood and every social virtue that would emblazon a court shut into that claybuilt hut I have so lately left Are you not in alliance with the whole party Does not your heart warm to every individual member of it though you will probably never know them but by my report Does not your attaching sentiment extend in a manner to the very vessel that brought the happy pair again together and to the adventurous skift that braved the tempest for her relief  Had I not been a  deliberate  if you will have it so a  sauntering  traveller and of the temperament I have pourtrayed you would have past your whole life perhaps without knowing there was such a groupe in existence hid as they are from high minded observers  There is a beautiful sentiment somewhere in Shenstone's prose volume which purports that he never casts his eye over a spacious map but he fancies in such and such countries are numberless amiable persons he would like to know and concludes with a sigh of regret  that it is impossible he ever should The traveller of my cast certainly stands a better chance of hitting upon some of these than he that is in and out of the country as fast as horses or wheels can carry him and of course though he passes by as many amiable people as even a generous heart could expect to find knows as little about them as those wheels or horses Whatever therefore you were before I set you down from this moment as a convert to residentiary travelling and moreover whenever you next examine your map to trace the wanderings of your correspondent you will be pleased to know what you certainly did not know before that upon the side of a barren heath at the edge of a roaring isea between Aberavon and Aberedstwith there stands a solitary hut which would open to distress as readily as to prosperity and afford its impartial bounty to whosoever is in want of it Ah that truth would warrant our saying so much in praise of half the houses that have the most room to spare and the best accommodation to bestow in the great city of London or any other great city but as Cooper says very sweetly though perhaps a little quaintly  "God made the country and man made the town"  After all there are good people every where if we take the trouble to look for them and to expect them without trouble or research in a world like this is preposterous As cities have their virtuous characters cottages have their villains and wherever censure is  general  it is in life as in literature perhaps  "Ten censure wrong for one who  acts  amiss"  At least the practise of condemning in the lump and erecting our panegyric on cottages on the ruins of old threadbare satire on courts is my abhorrence In either station one of your principles would be a just object of the love I bear you Is this a letter or a volume Lest in looking back you should  ask what it is about  I will abruptly end it by bidding you Adieu  LETTER VIII  TO THE SAME  Aberedstwith  TRUE my friend I plead guilty to your accusation of silence it has been a whole month since I last addressed you but I understood by yours which came to hand soon after mine was dispatched that you were in your bed of sickness and that heavy grief for the loss of one of the earliest adopted and most dearly loved of your friends occasioned it I have the most rooted dislike to interrupt or to be interrupted in the awful duties and inclinings of distress on these occasions It is usual I know to write a very long epistle of condolence and consolation on such cases but did not the intention sanctify the practice I should pronounce it impertinent if not impious It is obtruding upon our sorrow in its sabbath One whom we have long valued long conversed with will be seen by us in this world no more the day that bereaves us and the days of mourning that succeed it should be kept holy It should be hallowed with our tears Such tears often "do us good" or at worst they do us less harm than an unreasonable attempt to wipe them away And such efforts are always  more or less ineffectual the eloquence of Cicero cloathing the morality of Seneca would neither reach our hearts nor convince our understandings under the recent impressions of grief for the death of a long tried and long loved friend The ordinary applications are packs of proverbs and strings of maxims which tell us what we know to be true and  impracticable  Had I insulted you with any of these I should have dishonoured both the living and the dead I am not to learn that you have "the virtue to be moved" and that her you mourn had a double claim on your tender regrether own admirable qualities and her veneration for yours  As there is a point however beyond which sorrow should not pass so is there one that should bound the salutary silence of a friend That point is methinks arrived to you and to myself Your favour by the post of yesterday convinces me  "Discretion hath so far fought with Nature  "That you with  wisest  sorrow think on her  "Together with remembrance of yourself"  Your observation that there was a resemblance betwixt me and the deceased in the construction of our minds or at least in the formation of our taste is extremely flattering particularly in  an hour like this when you have been as it were embalming the qualities that most pleased you in the latter with your tears I remember you was formerly of this opinion The difference of our ages made nothing against the similitude of our spirits The few days I passed in the company of this second De l'Enclos at your house in the winter of were amongst the few that hurried away from life without feeling one moment too long Shall we ever forget the enthusiasm of sympathy that by an involuntary impulse threw us into each other's embraces on our discovery that we both held long conversations with ourselves and as regularly went on with question and answer as if we had been in the heat of debate in a room full of company You remember likewise I trust our satisfaction on finding that we had been both set down for people out of their wits by the  "Sly flow things with circumspective eyes"  and that we should both descend to the grave with the  reputation  of having been distracted that is to say having had the power of extracting sweets from those flowery trifles which others who are as pleased with trifles not a whit better themselves reckon amongst the weeds of life  Her journey to the tomb of her grandmother from whose bounty she had received many valuable things and from whose pious conduct in life the rich legacy of a virtuous example is never to quit either your memory or mine my dear friend The distance betwixt the spot where she herself liv'd and that where her venerable ancestor was buried the difficulties she encountered on the way and the pleasure of accomplishing her purpose were all circumstances to interest her excellent heart but how was this pleasure augmented by the little adventures she met with in the village where the bones of this amiable relative were deposited Her own eloquent manner of relating is necessary to give the portrait of both the cause and effect on that occasion The face and figure over which Beauty's great destroyer Time could gain but a partial and imperfect victory should be before you to feel the fulness of her happiness on her hearing from the whole neighbourhood who had her in remembrance a long detail of the worthiest kindest actions She made the tour of the village and in almost every house saw or heard of something to make her proud that she sprung  "From unattainted blood  "And claim'd a  birthright  to be good"  What indeed must have been the transport of a mind like her's on gathering from one poor family that to the deceased they owed their preservation from a prison from another the portion of a daughter from a third a timely rescue from the jaws of poverty and so on in benevolent successions This village too was the abode of her early days How vivid were the pictures she drew of her revisitation to the scenes which had made upon a susceptible heart the first impressions and which half a century's absence had not power to impair Like a lover faithful to his first affections she told us you know how she saluted many of the green lanes allies and old inhabitants as friends for whom though long parted she retained a kind remembrance she paid particular respect to the yews that shaded her relation's grave and had a long interview with some elms now grown into stately trees which were of her own planting she called them her children and told them she rejoiced to see them do well in the world and prosper  But that which had more magic for me on this occasion was I confess the very points which your very sober sensical people who are vain of their rationality would be the least satisfied withthe romantic means she  used to bring this journey of her heart to bear Nothing could favour it moreeven a writer of romances could not than the character and disposition of the resident clergyman of the village who in answer to her letter of enquiry respecting the possibility of a few days accommodation and describing the motives sent her a pressing and indeed irresistible invitation to his own house assuring her at the same time that himself and every part of his family entered so cordially into the virtuous spirit of her intended adventure that they were desirous to give it every encouragement and assistance begging her withal to remember that the moment she entered the Parsonage of she was at  home  because wherever there is  sympathy  there is  natural affection  and of course though personal strangers before they meet on the terms of near relations whom a wiser and better Director than Chance has at last brought together  Her first grand point being thus carried and so much in her own way the rest was of no difficult attainment for though Mr L S her husband is a man of the world and well knows how to traffic with it the spirit of trade had not so far absorbed the spirit of conjugal love as to obstruct any innocent dispositional  impulse his wife wished to follow The Quixotism before mentioned indeed appeared to him carrying the joke too far and it was no easy matter to make him believe the fair Quixote serious His reasoning upon it was so characteristic of the man of business that it formed the finest contrast to the ideas and expectations of the woman of genius  What my dear take a journey of an hundred miles to visit the grave of your grandmotherWrite a long rigmerole epistle which I dare say is very fine and all that to a man you never saw Why what sort of answer can you expect Depend on it the gentleman will set you down as a madwoman and so write you no answer at all  And when the answer did come all I can say is added Mr L S he is as mad as you Go by all means continued he heartily laughing in a good humoured manner pray go wise for 'tis pity two houses should part you Have your frolic out I beg only if when you get together you should make one another worse and should wish for apartments nearer Moorfields drop me a line and I will do the needful  Our heroine you know was too much in earnest to be laughed out either of her feelings or her object and set out at "peep of dawn" on her expedition The worthy family more than justified their promises and the congenial spirits which were thus made known to each enjoyed a higher "feast of reason" or at least "flow of soul" than they had ever before experienced On her return Mr L S received her with the same goodnature he had suffered her to depart and contented himself with pleasantly observing that as she had overstayed her intended time of coming back many days he hoped she was as happy as she had expected to be on which my dear cried he embracing herI have only to say that your fine sentimental people of genius about love friendship sympathy congeniality of souls and all that are the most forward thoughtless and impudent folks in the world for I could no more go to a stranger's house and feel myself at home in it without having any manner of business with the family than I could fly in the airI hope however you have had the grace to invite them here by way of  per contra  for we are devilishly in arrears to the gentleman at present and as I trust I am a tolerably honest man though thank God no genius I shall be glad to assist  you in paying the debts you have contracted with all my heart But now tell me fairly as 'tis all overadded hedid you find it answer Was you not plaguy sick of each other of yourselves and of your old Granny into the bargain before you had been there three days only you were ashamed to own it for fear of being laughed at  Sick tired reiterated Mrs L S why I was in Paradise and we could have passed our whole lives together without knowing a weary moment Tired there was not a dry eye in the whole family when I got into the carriage to come back and for my part I thought I should have broke my heart  I thank you for the compliment however with all my heartreplied the husband taking off his hat and making her a bow In Paradise was you well that is amazing for I know I should have been the most miserable fellow in the worldnevertheless invite the strange gentleman and his strange family here that we may settle accounts and strike the balanceI have no more to say upon it  How wonderful my dear friend is it to consider the  variety  of human minds We are  told there are more different forts than of mossOught we not rather to say the forts are as numerous as there are sands on the shore In every single family there are usually as many different tastes and tempers as there are persons and if in some there happens to be a  family likenèss  in  feelings  as in features though the resemblance may be striking in some things there is almost always a marked difference in others and with respect to pains and pleasures the means of avoiding the one and of promoting the other are as diversified as the objects which produce them nay the fond prepossession we have for our own amusements and pursuits gives us so strong a prejujudice against those of other people of other dispositions and habits that we too often want candour and toleration enough to suffer our neighbours to be happy in their own way Persons of a vigorous fancy and a warm heart accuse those who are less ardent of being insensible while these on the other hand  censure their censurers  as excentric and visionary on both sides with as little reason as we should condemn the greyhound for wanting the sagacity of the pointer or of the pointer for being less swift than the greyhound each being gifted by nature with the talent and quality best accommodated to its ease and felicity  An ingenious friend of mine who by the bye takes many curious ways of making up his own happiness is used to say whenever he meets with or hears of any thing that does not accord with his plans of acting or thinking "  there must be people of all sorts"  Now as there is certainly room enough in the world  for all sorts of people  it seems rather selfish that we should jostle against each other in the journey we are all taking and "fall out by the way" because some are able or willing to go faster than others because one takes delight in the objects which another passes unnoticed All that can fairly be said on that is should any one be disposed to find fault these are  my  objects friend though they are not your's I was born to relish them you were not when we come to your's I promise you you shall stop to enjoy them as long as you please and though possibly I shall find as little satisfaction in them as you do in mine  considered in themselves  yet the thought of their giving you pleasure shall make me endure them meantime I trust you will bear with mine  Can any thing be more equitable Can any thing be more easy yet half the bickerings of the human race in civil affairs proceeds  from a scorn of this fair dealing betwixt man and man each insisting not only in taking the road he himself likes best but that others of tempers and business utterly different and whose objects perhaps lie in a quite contrary route must take it too and if he refuses be set down as an obstinate mortal that is resolved to go his own way  I do really think this is a very unreasonable mode of proceeding especially as I before said there are objects sufficient for us all and certainly I may with as much propriety quarrel with a person for having a different complexion as a different taste and just as rationally expect he should to humour my caprice take my skin and throw away his own as to cast off those feelings which naturally belong to him and put on mine yet the best and kindesthearted people often dispute the point Were the worthless only engaged in and hurt by the strife and were the matter in debate only a choice of vicious pursuits one might be content to let them battle it out but I have seen indeed every body sees many instances where persons of good minds and understandings yet differing in the mode of exercising them have so little respect for what pleases others and so great a veneration for what  pleases themselves that unless they are all pleased with the same thing they effectually take care that there shall be no pleasure at all Ah my friend how many elopements separate maintenances divisions in friendship disorders in the church and disturbances in the state has this selfwilled tenaciousness occasioned Unquestionably "the aim and end of "our being" is happiness but it is to be found associated too with equal innocence in ten thousand times ten thousand paths  "Each happy in his own"  "The learn'd is happy nature to explore  "The fool is happy that he knows no more  "The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n  "The poor contents him with the care of heav'n  "See the blind beggar dance the cripple sing  "The sot a hero lunatic a king  "One prospect lost another still we gain  "And not a vanity is given in vain  "Whate'er the knowledge passion fame or pelf  "Not one will change his neighbour with himself"  All this is the very perfection of poetry and it has a considerable degree of truth but though each  is  thus "happy in his own" there is not one of the characters here described who is not at times out of humour even with himself because his neighbour is or wishes to be as happy as he but begs leave to borrow  it from  another source  Surely this is not asking too much and yet it is "hardly granted"  Possibly my highly endowed and highlyrespected friend I may all this time have been forcing  you  out of the path of your contemplations into mine but I had a better motive for it than most intruders can give and I trust my design is in some measure answered  Our  desires and aversions you know are for the most part the same I exult in the resemblance and wherever we are of opposite ideas I am so satisfied you have the best reasons for your opposition that I immediately set about examining my own ideas and have been more than once the better for the scrutiny In life and at death I will thank you Farewell  P S I have a month's Gleanings to present you with and shall lay the whole sheaf at your feet in my next It would be doing a violence to my feelings were I to mix any matter with this letter not in keeping with the object to which it is sacred You can account for this Adieu  LETTER IX TO THE SAME  Aberesidwith  THIS town is neither good nor bad The streets are beyond comparison the dirtiest I ever saw a proof of which is their being at this moment indicted by the inhabitants No wonder therefore if strangers complain Indeed they must be rugged and unpleasant at all times for the country here is flat stoney and rugged The environs are neither barren nor fertile and the only walks or in truth  walkable  places are those at the end of the town round the ruined castle another round the churchyard and another very short one by the side of the harbour The beach is impassable and the bathing places difficult and unchearful In fine it is in almost all respects the reverse of Barmouth except that it has the advantage in the number of houses and of course in the company I should not have thought any thing here worth mentioning had it not been to give you a few hints by way of directory not to let the greater popularity of this place draw you from the other Barmouth where your bath will be more  comfortable and your  agrémens  from the surrounding objects out of all comparison whatever  For want of other allurements I chose this place to throw together the observations that were scattered about my notebook respecting certain customs usages and a variety of other things it may be proper for a traveller to be apprized of particularly the articles of  expenditure  In the first place it is a settled usage and custom throughout the principality for the trading part of the people to overreach you in your little marketings or bargains with them that is to say they will ask all strangers of genteel appearance about a third more than they would ask a native or countryman but even allowing this you will have almost all the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life at least by a third cheaper than with very few exceptions the cheapest parts of England at first you may put up with a little extortion which will diminish as you become residentiary All places as they get into reputation for any beauty or convenience and are therefore the resorts of people that since they can afford to travel are supposed to  be wealthy grow dear at first imperceptibly till in a few years that commodity which you could procure for sixpence is not to be obtained for a shilling and so on in proportion This is remarkably verified in Wales ground houserent and the necessaries of life are so much raised in price since my first tour of this country about twelve years ago that were not the fact universally admitted I should be afraid you would suspect me of profiting by the licence  expected  to be taken by travellers were I to mention the comparative difference betwixt that time and the present in both North and South Wales  Nevertheless a good oeconomist might in the family way even at the present day make one hundred pounds tell in this country to three hundred in any other belonging properly to England I here speak however of comparative prices in the smaller towns and villages in the cities the estimate must be about two to one in favour of Wales In Caermarthen and Caernarvon for example the one a principal town to the southward the other northward you get fish fowl butcher's meat eggs bacon and firing certainly the grand articles in domestic establishment on an average at the following rates  salmon fresh and fine from the  s  d  market per pound      A fine turbot ditto    ½  Fine cod each      Eggs eight nine ten for      Couple of ducks or fowls fit for killing      Very often      Chickens half grown each for      A fat goose or turkey each      Bacon per pound      Beef mutton c c      Coals or rather culm per bushel      In little villages higher up the country both ways the cheapness for want of a market is still more extraordinary if we except the remote places of England near the seacoast and certain parts of Cornwall and Yorkshire this statement which you may depend on it is the correct result of residentiary remark will convince you that this principality is not more abundantly supplied with the ornamental than the useful and that as those who have taste fortune and talents could not be more gratified in visiting it on the score of romantic beauty they who found it expedient to retrench to narrow their establishment and yet to diminish none of the comforts to which they  have been accustomed could not any where find a more peaceful plentiful and healthy retreat With this additional  agrément  that almost all places are so surrounded by good neighbours and there is really a dispositional as well as hereditary hospitality amongst the native gentry that a new settler never need to be in want of agreeable society  I insist upon this the rather as it is not more the chimera of persons of genius going into foreign countries for fine scenery than it is for people of small or broken fortunes to gather the wrecks of their property and carry them  abroad  on the false superstition that they may there sooner  repair their ruins  and as it were rebuild themselves and families than in any parts of the British dominion I must own that although I have travelled too much not to have rubbed off all the little or great national prejudices that cling to my honest friend  John Bull  and although I have had abundant reason to prove that Providence has been far more equal in its indulgences to all the inhabitants of the globe than stayathome people can ever be made to believe I am Englishman enough to adopt that sentiment of a brother wanderer which advises us not to spend more money out of our own country than is necessary  Methinks indeed it is but fair to give our own country the preference where advantages are at least equal If for example a family finds an arrangement in London or any of the provincial towns no longer supportable and can accomplish all the objects of a change of place as well at the end of two hundred as two thousand miles I humbly conceive that the shortest cut to the land of oeconomy is the best in which the good old maxim of choosing the least of two evils is confirmed by common sense Should any of your friends therefore henceforward find such retirements worth looking after they may be found in almost any part of the principality north or south two hundred miles from the British capital and if the other hundred is added the expence of making it would in the end be well repaid by the beauty of the country and the reasonableness of provisions House rent is likewise a very important article A friend of mine occupied an exceeding large well furnished house sufficient for his numerous family and had more than enough of garden and orchard ground to supply it with vegetables and fruits and pasturage for a couple of horses and a cow at the yearly rent of l a year free of taxes I saw many others on a smaller scale at l and l unfurnished houses with  land enough to pay a considerable part of the rent and reserves for your own use may be had in the most beautiful situations at a proportionate rate You will please to note that this is not meant as a character of partial places but as general information with respect to the whole country  The exceptions to the rule are made not so much by the people of Wales as those of England and Ireland the imprudence of whom I shall enlarge on in its place At present I shall content myself by observing that when they have lost their estates it would be well for them if they could contrive to lose the folly by which their insolvency was produced But unfortunately that prodigal spirit which attended them in affluent accompanies them in slender circumstances and wherever they go for refuge they carry their expensive ideas and habits along with them absurdly supposing they can reconcile their former notions with their present system of oeconomy as if like a person in a fever they imagined a cure could be performed by merely changing their posture A great deal more is necessary in a family reform than quitting the haunt of its former follies or misfortunes They come into a new country find it reasonable take the first opportunity  to play off their pride against their poverty shew the people they mix with that they still wish to be looked on as personages of distinction boast of what fortunes they have already squandered and what they can still afford to lavish put the natives first upon extortion furnishing them with the  hint  to cheat and then but too late quarrel with them for  taking  it Thus deep play late hours and every excess of London and Dublin are at the time I am now writing together with clubs and other townbred luxuries in the  high ton of folly  in many places where the inhabitants grow rich and roguish by supplying them I extremely dislike personality or could give you no inconsiderable catalogue of rustic gaming houses White's Brookes's c in the very heart of Cambria In as much therefore as they have degenerated from the simplicity of ancient manners and from the honesty of ancient maxims into the  refinements  of the world on which we so much pique ourselves the fault is originally our own and we must take the consequences Luxury is a wide spreading evil my friend and soon passes from one country to another making proselytes as it goes Assure yourself it has travelled into this country and has its votaries in the mountains They contain more than one farmer  who in imitation of his English brothers of the plough keeps his pair of geldings for the chace and a sidesaddle pad for the lady of the dairy who feathers her cap with the finest of the farmers wives and daughters whom we have seen at the rural assemblies and acting the characters of duchesses for that night only Although some twenty years back when the town had not quite journeyed so far into the north country Welchward at least these newmade gentry were contented to trudge on foot ten or a dozen miles after the duties of the morning were over to a rustic hop at the summons of a blind harper and the dames and damsels thought themselves well off if they could get into one of the carts or mount by pairs on the back of one of the carthorses to give the Corydons of the hills the meeting The corruption stops not at amusement it extends to business the first must be supplied by the last but as this cannot be done in the way of ordinary it must be effected by extraordinary means Supernumerary horses dresses c are not to be maintained at the old market profits these though equivalent to the necessaries are inadequate to the luxuries of life and luxuries once indulged soon become necessaries for where is the male swain that having as it were  flown  over the  mountains on a hunter will stoop again to  creep  over them on "Dobbin or the foundered mare" or the female who will for the sake of oeconomy dismount her feathers and exchange again the glaring folly of her shewy attire for her wheel of cottage industry  "and robes of country brown"  It is out of the nature of pleasingly pernicious effects to expect it  ergo  the price of their commodities must be raised and it is but reasonable that as we occasioned the folly we should contribute to its support  As we advance however into the interior parts of the country and the farther from the route of modish travellers always the better as we get more into those unfrequented places from whence "the sober wishes" of the inhabitants have "not learned to stray" and where none but literary and gleaning travellers delight to explore we find this hardy and happy race of people rejoicing like their country in the simplest charms of nature and Mr Gray who made a philosophical tour of Wales you know must have had numberless living reasons in the course of it to exclaim  "Since ignorance is bliss  "'Tis folly to be wise"  and to see the sentiment brought to the test truth indeed warrants our carrying the sentiment much farther for in this case the wisdom of the world is worse than foolishness it is knavery and we may rather cry out with Addison  "If knowledge of the world must make men vicious  "May peasants ever live in ignorance"  I have seen groupes of poor people in the sequestered spots of both North and South Wales sporting amongst the precipices or in the glens with a "content so absolute" as to look on any objects less in a state of nature than themselves as unwelcome at the sight of an unexpected man of the world they will run from him into a rocky cavity like a rabbit into its hole or plunge into the thickest shade of the valley as if they were escaping from a beast of prey Were they to know what a snaky train of passions are probably folded up in the bosom of that welldressed worldling which never crept into their breasts they would often have reason to believe he was the most dangerous monster they could encounter and double their diligence to avoid him  And here amongst the usages and customs I must not omit to inform you that what you have perhaps often heard without believing  respecting the  mode of courtship  amongst the Welch peasants is true The lower order of people do actually carry on their love affairs in bed and what would extremely astonish more polished lovers they are carried on honourably it being at least as usual for the pastora's of the mountains to go from the bed of courtship to the bed of marriage as unpolluted and maidenly as the Chloes of fashion and yet you are not to conclude this proceeds from their being less susceptible of the  belle passion  than their betters or that the cold air which they breathe has "froze the genial current of their souls" By no means if they cannot boast the voluptuous languors of an Italian sky they glow with the bracing spirit of a more invigorating atmosphere I really took some pains to investigate this curious custom and after being assured by many of its veracity had an opportunity of attesting its existence with my own eyes The servant maid of the family I visited in Caernarvonshire happened to be the object of a young peasant who walked eleven long miles every sunday morning to favour his suit and regularly returned the same night through all weathers to be ready for monday's employment in the fields being simply a day labourer He usually arrived in time for morning service which he  constantly attended after which he escorted his Dulcinea home to the house of her master by whose permission they as constantly past the succeeding hour in bed according to the custom of the country These tender sabbatical preliminaries continued without any interruption near two years when the treaty of alliance was solemnized and so far from any breach of articles happening in the intermediate time it is most likely that it was considered by both parties as a matter of course without exciting any other idea On speaking to my friend on the subject he observed that though it certainly appeared a dangerous mode of making love he had seen so few  living  abuses of it during six and thirty years residence in that county where it nevertheless had always more or less prevailed he must conclude it was as innocent as any other One proof of its being  thought  so by the parties is the perfect ease and freedom with which it is done no aukwardness or confusion appearing on either side the most wellbehaved and decent young women giving into it without a blush and they are by no means deficient in modesty What is pure in idea is always so in conduct since bad actions are the common consequence of ill thoughts and though the better sort of people treat this ceremony as a  barbarism it is very much to be doubted whether more  faux pas  have been committed by the Cambrian boors in this  free access  to the bed chambers of their mistresses than by more fashionable Strephons and their nymphs near  "Dimpled brook and fountain brim"  in groves and shady bowers The power of habit is perhaps stronger than the power of passion or even than of the charms which inspire it and it is sufficient almost to say a thing is the  custom of a country  to clear it from any reproach that would attach to an innovation Were it the practice of a few only and to be gratified by stealth there would from the strange construction of human nature be more cause of suspicion but being ancient general and carried on without difficulty it is probably as little dangerous as a teteatete in a drawingroom or in any other fulldress place where young people meet to say soft things to each other A moonlight walk in Papa's garden where Miss steals out to meet her lover  against the consent of her parents  and of course extremely agreeable to the young people has ten times the peril  Amongst the customs that had peculiar attractions for me was the tender veneration paid externally at least to the dead the  churchyards being kept with an attentive decency we in vain look for in many other countries There is something extremely simple and pleasing in the  idea  as well as in the practice of strewing flowers and evergreens over the graves of departed friends and relations Every Saturday some of the survivors perform the established duty at the family grave This confists in clearing it of all weeds repairing the mould dressing the verdure mending the little fences of white tiles or shells that surround it and in short putting it in order against the Sabbath then the whole parish are to be eye witnesses of the pious cares of each other I have seen graves so diligently cultured that it has every week been planted with the choicest flowers of the season others have been ornamented with the more permanent shrubs and the little hillocks sacred to infants have literally bestowed on them  "All the incense of the breathing Spring"  Several good purposes are answered hereby I will recount some of them to you in the words of a Pembrokeshire widow whom I lately saw decorating the graves of her husband and a child their first born who died in the same year The following is a faithful copy of our conversation  Your employment must be very interesting to you  It is our way in these parts Sir Some think it a trouble I have no pleasure now that equals it yet I am sure to have wet eyes all the time it is doing  The relations then at whose graves you are performing this sadly pleasing duty must needs have been very near and dear to you  They could not be more so This was the best husband and the most honest man in Wales and the roses and violets which I have just been setting at the head and feet of this grave are not sweeter or prettier than the poor little girl who lies under them But they are in a better place and I ought to be happy and so I am  Here she wept very bitterly  I see yonder an old man entering the churchyard with a large bundle of young plants which he can scarce carry  That man is in his ninety third year and has buried all his family the last was a grandson to whose grave he is now going and which he will make like a garden before he leaves it Almost all that end of the church yard are  his dead  and he is very neat and nice about the graves of all but the grandson's the most  Then he was the favourite of the family as the last and youngest perhaps he was the poor old man's Benjamin  On the contrary he lov'd him the least and some think that an unlucky blow given by the old man was the cause of the young one's death but it cannot be proved so he escapes but by his care about the poor young fellow's grave our townfolk imagine his conscience smites him though for that matter we all dress our dead here whether we love or hate them it is quite a scandal to let a Saturday pass without making every grave as clean as ourselves for the Sabbath  It is a very commendable custom and I wish with all my heart it were adopted in England where too generally speaking the repositaries of the dead are shockingly violated Horses cows sheep are often suffered to feed upon the grave nay the parson himself frequently turns his pad to fatten on his deceased parishioners This you will say is being priestridden with a vengeance still worse the hogs of half the parish are allowed to rootle up the earth and bones  Blessed be God the bones of my dear dear babe and husband do not lie in England  And as to cleanliness in other respects that article so properly an object of your care is very rarely attended to with us The weeds and nettles are permitted to choak up half the graves in a churchyard and every other species of negligence and filth is thrown there as if instead of being the decent receptacle of the forefathers of the village or town to which it belongs it were the common sewer of the parish Some few indeed are kept a little more orderly because they are either public walks and have therefore a degree of fashion or the bishop of the diocese is residentiary there but even these exceptions are for the most part confined to the pathways and the green avenues that shade them the rest of the spot being left in a condition both shameless and indecent In the northern district of shire two churchyards were indicted as nuisances by the parish and a third much nearer the seat of magistracy supreme was in so abominable a state that the clergyman and overseers after many fruitless complaints on the part of the inhabitants were cited to answer accusations in the Spiritual Court  Good heaven we want no overseers bishops or spiritual courts to make us keep our dead which surely Sir are a part of ourselves  whether above the earth or under it as free from such as we can If the grave we clean holds a good relation we shew our gratitude in our diligence if a bad one our constant attention is a mark that whatever trespasses he or she may have committed against us it is forgiven If a nettle or a weed was to be seen tomorrow in this churchyard the living party to whom it belongs would be hooted after divine service by the whole congregation I would part with my last farthing rather than see these two little heaps go to ruin nay except a few feet of earth I cultivate for use I decorate my garden with flowers and shrubs only for my dead and look upon it to be as much theirs as if they were both alive  The good woman here finished her discourse during the greater part of which she was upon her knees plucking up every thing which was unseemly freshning the mould fastning the loose tilework and forming with a mixture of maternal and conjugal tenderness the roseslips and violet roots into forms expressive of her affection  I cannot tell you how much I was moved Nor is it necessary You have an heart that has a beating sacred to such incidents  This custom is I believe peculiar in European countries to Wales and the Swiss Catholic Cantons but in the latter to an iron cross is suspended a bowl containing holy water with which the relatives sprinkle the graves of the deceased as often as they come to church  Shakspeare says and with his accustomed sweetness  "With fairest flowers while summer lasts  "I'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack  "The flow'r that's like thy face pale primrose  "Nor the azure harebell like thy veins no nor  "The leaf of Eglantine which not to slander  "Outscented not thy breath"  I trust my friend you will long continue your good wishes to the Pembrokeshire widow It is in this part of Wales that the women dress their heads in a peculiar manner they wear a cumbrous gown of dark blue cloth even in the midst of summer instead of a cap a large handkerchief is wrapt over their heads and tied under the chin in other places the women as well as the men wear large hats with broadbrims often flapping over their shoulders  These Gleanings however in the churchyard are a little out of place for when I was  on the subject of Welch courtships I ought to have immediately gone to Welch weddings this being you know the natural order unless you are of the opinion of not a few who assert that marriage and death are pretty much the same thing and that the former is only buying the living instead of the dead Many of my fair country women I fear think the latter would be a resource to them  The ceremonies of the Cambrian peasants in the unpolished parts of the country are no less singular than those at their wooing The friends and relations of both parties not only testify the usual demonstrations of joy during the daytime but keep it up the whole night the men visitors putting to bed the bridegroom and the females the bride after which the whole company remain in the chamber drinking jocund healths to the new married couple and their posterity singing songs dancing and giving into every other festivity sometimes for two or three days together  Preposterous enough you will say but as this generally speaking happens to a man and woman but once in a life and gives now and then an holiday that is a few hours or days labour to a race of harmless hardtoiling creatures  it may be dispensed with Their relaxations are few and our own many There is undoubtedly less refinement perhaps less delicacy in theirs but are they not as innocent as reasonable as ours  "A little softer but as senseless quite"  To you who are always  "blest yourself"  "To see your fellows blest"  I need not ask you to allow for the strange but unoffending usages of these humble children of nature Pride looks down upon them but is not pride more truly an object of pity But for these clods of moving earth as they are arrogantly called feeling themselves contented in their "happy lowly" situations what would become of that helpless part of the species who neither "toil nor spin" How frequently does it happen that an honest hind who seems scarcely distinguishable from the soil which he works into bread is of more use in the great community of mankind and of course a better member of it than a whole generation of those conceited beings who spurn his cottage and squander the noble inheritance of their ancestors amidst the vices of refinement How preferable the virtues of rusticity  LETTER X TO THE SAME  I Asserted that the lower order of people in this country are superstitious They were so at all times Anciently its contagion tinctured the more enlightened One of the old historians very gravely recounts numberless preternatural instances of casualties which he construed into divine judgments Amongst others he tells us that in the reign of Ivor the third prince of Wales there happened a remarkable earthquake in the Isle of Man which much disturbed and annoyed the inhabitants and in the year following that it rained  blood  both in Britain and Ireland insomuch that the butter and milk resembled the colour of blood What sanguinary torrents my friend must have fallen to have thus changed the nature of the grass and literally to make "the green one red" He adds these accidents of nature might probably presage some rumults and disturbances in the kingdom The same author I remember asserts that as a prognostic of the death of Elbodius archbishop of North Wales there happened a very severe eclipse of the sun  and the year following there was an eclipse of the moon and upon Christmas day and these he confiders as portents that boded no good to the Welch affairs By way of making out the prediction of the effect of these fatalities we are solemnly informed they were followed by a very grievous and general murrain of cattle which impoverished the whole country and the year preceding A D was marked by the West Saxons laying the city of St David's in ashes Thus it is my friend that soothesayers of every age first frame their prophecies and then inveterately fulfil them for the very next good or evil event that takes place is brought in evidence of what was foretold and however absurd in the nature of things or contradictory to the point in question at the time is tortured and twisted to answer the purpose of illustrating Hence the most improbable physically speaking the most impossble and heterogeneous circumstances are forced into contact and effects are traced to causes with which they have no sort of connection  The present descendants of Cadwallader are true to the faith of their forefathers on this article I saw it operating during my residence amongst them in a thousand ways but in none  more than in the instance which follows In a little village betwixt Caermarthen and Haverfordwest beautifully washed by the ocean I walked by the side of the sea where a mixed multitude were gathered on the beach I enquired the occasion and was told that the peculiar roaring of the waves to the westward indicated that some fatal accident would soon befal certain poor creatures out at sea for that in the memory of the oldest man living the billows were never known to make that hideous noise from that quarter without being succeeded by either the wreck of a vessel or the destruction of some of the crew or both that this being the first day of the roaring the disaster would probably happen in the course of two days more  three  being the usual term of these grumbling notices and therefore they were now come down to the beach as well to see whether any vessel had hoisted signals of distress or if too late for assistance to receive dead should any of the bodies be thrown on shore The time at which this happened was that of the herring season when prositing by the previous calm weather a great many fishingboats were out and it is by no power that I have over language nor indeed in language itself to give you a just idea of the consternation of many persons of both sexes now  gathered together most of them being wives children masters or relations of those whose destiny was thus denounced by the troubled spirit of the waters The fishingboats however in the course of the next day and evening all arrived safe with their crew and with singularly good cargoes some other vessels which had stood farther out to sea on coasting voyages took shelter in the same harbour till the storm should cease or rather till the fair weather should be more confirmed for it had considerably cleared and calmed before they pointed their canvass to the shore All they wanted was a slight repairing which could not be conveniently given at sea The little fishingsmacks performed several lucky excursions after this the other barks proceeded on their respective voyages and though in the mean time there was not heard any more prophetical growlings the people were not in the least staggered in their belief of some calamity having happened roundly asserting that the voice of the ocean was always oracular that its mouth was opened by God and that it could not therefore utter the thing that was not Another evidence was that more than one instance was within the recollection of every man woman and child in the parish About a month after happening to pass through  this village in my way back from Milford Haven I understood from the landlord of the inn where I stopped that notwithstanding my incredulity about the roarings the sea did not roar  without reason  for the bodies of two sailors were floated into the harbour the very day after I went away This your are to know was above three weeks after the tempest but on my venturing to doubt the connection betwixt the effect and the cause on account of the distance of time mine host grew seriously angry and asked me whether I was a believer or an heathen I did not think proper to reply to this angry question convinced that a man  predetermined  either to believe or disbelievewhether in politics religion or any other matter hardens his heart against every thing that does not feed his faith and is prepared against all arguments human or divine and like a cat pent up in a corner is only more spiteful and resolute as it appears difficult to break away Just as the Ostler was leading my horse to the door a couple of sailors came to the inn and in presence of my landlord informed me that they were brother and uncle to the aforesaid dead mariners who had deserted after mutiny were brought back once and pardoned then threw themselves overboard thinking to swim ashore  and would have been hanged if they had not been drowned as 'twas on board a king's ship Thus you see the poor sea was made to sympathise with these offenders unless you can borrow a little of my landlord's faith and believe that it drowned them in a judgment and then sent forth its roarings to shew its sense of such wickedness as a warning to others There exclaimed mine host with much exultation is not the thing plain enough now Was the sea in the right or not But some folks will never believe till a judgment falls on themselves Perceiving a tempest gathering in the countenance of this friend of the roaring sea I thought it the wisest way to leave him in full possession of a faith which had certainly the merit of being impregnable to all attacks from within or without  A second superstition universally prevalent in South Wales is of a nature no less extraordinary You will scarce meet with a peasant or even a manufacturer who does not pretend to have heard the groan or sigh of a voice rush like a sudden wind from out of the earth and sometimes entering into a very long and solemn harangue on the topic either of this world or the next Sometimes it assumes the tone of a friend sometimes of a foe sometimes  it is the wellknown sound of a person living but more usually one that has been in the grave long enough one should have thought to have done with conversation  A third object of Cambrian credulity is that of a lighted candle springing up before you without a moment's warning and going the way of your intended walk or ride for a number of miles together for it perfectly knows the road you are to take and what is no less singular the candle is carried by some invisible agent who was never known to make his appearance though some say it moves by a power of its own With respect to the moral agency of these it is generally allowed by the believers that both the voice and the light are sent on "errands full of love" The first is thought to be literally a  warning  voice and the last with a little more difficulty though nothing is in the end too arduous for superstition is made to be no less subservient to the purposes of a faith which even in its excesses leans to virtue  For this reason I have seldom attempted to argue down or treat lightly these and other little traditionary credulities in constant circulation amongst the uneducated part of mankind  since I am persuaded what they want in philosophy they make up by a much better thing for there is almost always a sense of religion accompanying these village legends a person who sees or seems to see these sights or hear these sounds is too sensibly affected by his imaginations to mix immediately in worse weaknesses the invisible voice will never argue in favour of a guilty deed nor the visionary candle conduct the man it attends to scenes of debauchery On the contrary the former will more surely suggest repentance to the erring swain and the other light him on his way to at least harmless thoughts and actions Could we therefore say to superstition "thus far shalt thou go and no farther" the simple of life and of heart might enjoy those little wanderings uncontrouled  But Superstition like Power is amongst the encroachers we dare not trust Indulgence makes her bold and unseasonable till in the end she becomes the parent of the worst disorders to which the human soul is incident You will hardly suppose that the most foaming sectaries infest the innermost recesses of this country that methodists of all denominations make the mountains reverberate with their fulminations louder than the anathemas of Rome and that  there is scarce a village or a dozen scattered hamlets which receive not twice or thrice a week the effusions of a strolling preacher  Something more affecting than curiosity has made me several times an auditor of these flaming discourses which are held in barns stables or the open fields It seems incredible that half the congregation should be contained in the villages but the fact is that on the preaching days the people come pouring in from all quarters within the district and vales and mountains give up their inhabitants I shall not speak to you of the doctrine which is pretty much the same every where and England is sufficiently overrun by these itinerants to make its jargon familiar to every one except that both the doctrine and the way of delivering it is more vehement and vociferous in Wales than I ever remember to have witnessed elsewhere In speaking of the Lamb of God the preacher assured his hearers that if they were sincere believers they would feel it move and hear it bleat within their hearts that if lifted up by the Holy Spirit they might see it that if they folded up their hands they might reach it touch it and embrace it as he did under divine assistance at that moment  Previous to this last round in the ladder of fanaticism being gained like the Delphic God "his voice enlarged and his form was  more  than ruffled" but on mounting the climax his bellowings could be equalled in horror only by his contortions No bull driven into madness by the annoying dogs and more distracting men so flounced or so shifted his attitudes or roared with so much mingled rage and agony but if the phrenzy of the preacher could have been surpassed it would have yielded to that of the congregation the tears sighs and yellings of which accompanied by the extravaganza's of action really threw at  sober  distance all that I ever saw all that I ever heard of human or of beastial violence  I do not know whether this intemperate zeal obstructs or promotes the industry of these poor creatures whether they return to their several occupations with more or less assiduity after these ebullitions but as the preachings begin about noon and continue some hours it must absorb a great deal of that time which might be past in more useful though less violent labour for I dare venture to say the hardest work they were ever put to for a day together never so wasted their animal spirits strained their muscles or wearied  limbs as two hours past in this religious fury  But even this is better than the opposite extreme of fitting arrogantly loose to all religions or what is worse scoffing at the faith of others and affecting to have none oneself This is amongst the errors into which the sons and daughters of simplicity rarely fall It is reserved for the children of refinement to spurn at all things holy with them religion is a mighty convenient wellcontrived bugbear to keep the slaves of the world in order just as birds are scared by a maukin but that more enlightened fouls cannot be expected to give into the illusion so that the rich the prosperous and all those who have received the greatest bounties and indulgencies at the hands of Providence are the only persons who think themselves exempt from the duty or necessity of acknowledging it  My friend I have lived in the world and travelled over it long enough to be convinced that what superficial pretenders call philosophy has done more mischief a thousand times a thousand than either ignorance or superstition Every conceited spark that has courage enough to avow himself an Atheist  and just wit enough to sport the old threadbare arguments in support of it is now a philosopher that is he can laugh at the jest he breaks on religion and repeat with vivacity the blasphemous  bonmots  that others have made against the author of it not reflecting that indecency in wit like immodesty in beauty is a base prostitution of those sacred gifts which are truly delightful only in the proportion that they are innocently exercised  But this irreverence of things holy is by no means the effect either of true philosophy or true courage for both these are friends to piety and there is as much difference betwixt a commonplace Atheist and a Christian philosopher as betwixt an hero and a coward Pretenders to infidelity are indeed always cowards they are afraid of their own consciences the "compunctious visitings" of which they attempt to escape by a loud laugh as children and common country people endeavour to disguise their terrors in passing through a churchyard in the dark by making a noise or whistling as they run No my friend philosophy is what our poet of nature the Virgilian Thomson has described it  "Effusive source of  evidence and truth  "A lustre shedding o'er th' ennobled mind  "Stronger than summer noon and  pure  as that  "Whose mild vibrations sooth the parted soul  "She springs  al  f  with elevated pride  "Above the tangling mass of low desires  "And angel wing'd  "The heights of science and of  virtue  gains"  Look at the modern affecter of philosophy that is of infidelity in his hours of sickness or in the moments of death Did those friends or relatives who are then behind the curtain ever report satisfactory or consistent accounts of the philosophy of the expiring guilty The instances are rare even where the most illustrious  philosopheratheists  have died without either formally disavowing or by implication believing their miserable system As the excess of wickedness is certainly the extreme of folly we may fairly adopt the maxim of our truly Christian poet  "Men may live fools but fools they cannot die"  Will you not then come into my apology for a village superstition under certain restrictions Sacred be the visionary candle and the fancied voice They may lead perhaps to the paradise of simplicity but will not seduce the easy of faith into the paradise of fools  May faith philosophy and the virtues which are their offspring be their guide Farewell  LETTER XI TO THE SAME  I Rejoice to hear by your's that you are well amused with the subject of my last for I have not yet done with it I have in reserve another Welch superstition by way of  BonneBouche  for if I can give it to you with any of the impressions it made on me you will find it more entertaining than any I have yet recounted  Contrive to be serious I beg of you while in soberness I acquaint you that queen Mab and all her Elsin train however banished out of England have at all times had both house and land in Wales There is not a more general received opinion throughout the principality than that of the existence of  fairies  Amongst the commonalty it is indeed universal and by no means unfrequently credited by the second ranks my insatiable curiosity in tracing this fact has enabled me to discover it in more than one instance amongst the first During my residence in Glamorganshire I was told of a clergyman who had not only a belief in these little creatures but who had  written a book containing a great many of their exploits The gentleman who gave me this information was acquainted with the author to whom I was introduced but was apprized by my conductor as we walked along that he was generally thought to be "a little cracked" As I well know that all sorts of people who follow up any pursuit or passion out of the common track of action or sentiment with the enthusiasm necessary to excel in it are accounted more or less out of their minds and as I have myself been long in the enjoyment of this reputationfor surely it is a kind of  fame  to suffer in the opinion of the cold and unfeeling for one's warmth of heart I laid little stress upon this part of my guide's information The subject which the author had chosen and the solemn manner in which he treated it went much more in my mind to impeach his judgment than his intellect but as every man has his hobbyhorse a fairy  tale  is perhaps as pleasant to carry one to fairy  land  as any other so I made my how to him without prejudice for just as his friend my companion had finished this very friendly account of him we came within view of his parsonage at the door of which he was regaling himself with a pipe We entered into familiar conversation almost immediately that  we had changed the civilites of meeting for he had been apprised of our coming and was so full charged with his favourite topic that he went off like a rocket The first shot being his I had no opportunity to return it till he had most solemnly attested every story of his book to be apostolical he related to me as much supplementary matter intended to enrich a second edition as would have made an eighteenpenny pamphlet of itself But our Parson rode his fairy pad so furiously that it not only run away with him but with our dinner and though I have all possible disposition to indulge people in these fallies hoping for and insisting upon the like complaisance when I am galloping away on my  own  poney I felt such an incorrigible desire on this occasion to weigh "solid pudding against the empty praise" of these little imaginary beings in Elfin Land that I left the good priest to his "lenten entertainment" and made the best of my way back to a more eleemosinary banquet  Did I not tell you quoth my introducer as we went home that the poor man was mad though I think he was more  compos  to day than I have ever known him Indeed replied I if this is his lucid interval what must be his perfect distraction O this is nothing  answered his friend I have known him run on about the fairies till he has foamed at the mouth like a mad dog and sworn that there were then a thousand in the room with him visible only to himself on account of his great respect for them and I remember once one our townsfolk laughing at him in one of these sairyfits he fell into a passion and said he would make these little mischiefs pinch and baunt them by day and night for their tauntings and as sure as you are alive continued my guide upon two of the company snapping their fingers and saying they neither cared for him nor the fairies he made them both repent it for that very night and all the next day the poor men were so tormented by these little devils God forgive me that they were obliged to make interest with Parson the gentleman we have just left to get them off the premises  Then you believe in their existence yourself  Heaven forbid that I should not I have been sufferer enough by them I know to have my creed well settled in that respect But to tell you the truth they always had a spite against me and my whole family and for a  trifle which would not have put a fly out of temper  What did you do to vex them  Only barred up a window next to the room where you slept last night  What objection had they to that  Why they used to throw up the fash every night and steal every thing they could lay their hands on  Are they such dishonest brats The little rouges Who could have thought it  The greatest thieves in the world Sir little as they are  Are you serious Do you really believe in them  Believe I wish you would to night sleep in the barred room that's all  With all my heart  I would not advise you You had better not I wish I could throw it out of my house without pulling the whole building to pieces  I'll venture however  No you shan't I won't have your life nor your limbs to answer for besides the little toads begin to be tired of hankering about and if I keep it closed another year I expect they will find another haunt For they don't fancy any apartment but that  If there is a similarity in the faith of you and your friend on this article why laugh at him or consider him as out of his senses  Let us call a better subject Sir for you see we have got safe home and if you are half as hungry as I am you will think a good sparerib of pork which I expect to find on the table though betwixt hot and cold is worth all fairyland  Thus it is my friend we are accurate criticks in discovering and exposing the weaknesses of others but are quite blind to our own  tho' of the same size and kind  How true it was from the beginning How true it will be to the end that "we see the more in the eye of our brother but discover not the beam in our own"  Believing that I had fallen partially amongst the votaries of the fairy legions by meeting with two men who though of different manners  and characters had nearly the same degree of credulity the one a worshipper from fear the other from reverence I resolved to see farther into the subject before I concluded the opinion about these airy sprites to be general for to tell you the truth I came with a mind little favourable to admit the impressions which Camden and other Cambrian biographers had attempted to make upon it shall I confess that I not only contested the fact itself as to the agency of these beings as sincerely as I did those gentry of Liliput about their own supposed size and dimensions but I thought the report of these historians  likewise  a fiction allowed to travellers as an indulgence in the way that we grant a poetical licence to the votaries of the muses Having therefore an equal degree of leisure and curiosity I was fixed to make farther enquiries accordingly the day following I accepted the offer of an agreeable and intelligent companion who proposed an excursion to the hills in the neighbourhood of Pontipool which had been immemorially celebrated for the ancient and modern haunts of this tiny people In this little tour the beauty of the day and of the country rich in whatever could gratify a traveller I collected abundant living evidence that the  belief  in these small personages was  solemn and general Those said my associate pointing to a chain of stupendous and even Alpine hills to the left those though I believe it not are thought to be every night traversed by thousands of fairies the centre part of the middle mountain is called their table and on numberless green circles which grow greener under their stootsteps they are said to revel We entered with freedom several little picturesque cottages scattered round these delicious hills and vales and I perceived that on the subject of fairies the creed of every peasant was the same in every hut I found superstition had a seat but I found that better at least more hospitable guests were also the inmates health happiness simplicity industry innocence and paternal love The heartechoing kiss which a labourer gave to his twelfth child the nurseling while six others were gathering round him after a separation only of a few hours and while bread is all his utmost toil could work out of the mountains was a sight that might have taught wisdom to a philosopher envy to avarice and humility to a monarch It reached my very heart It will not be remote from yours but to move to melt it in the same degree you must make a visit to the fairy mountains and on such a day amidst such  scenery have your mind  possessed  with such objects upon the spot where they grow  It is singular that there are particular places all over this country where the malign influence of the fairy tribe has made the people look upon them as under a sort of spell Thus if we put the collective accounts together we shall perceive that the fairy race are rather bad than good neighbours for you will hardly meet with a Welch peasant who is not provided with some instances to their discredit within his own knowledge It is incredible to what lengths the malice of these sprites will go if we are to believe the asseverations of the swains they live amongst instead of being in goodfellowship as might be expected of welldisposed fairies they take delight only in cheating and annoying them There are several houses particularly some antique halls which have so ill fame for being  haunted  by the fairies that the poorest persons in the country would rather sleep unsheltered and  "Bide the pelting of the pitiless storm"  than have the finest apartments therein I am certain they would not pass a single night in any of these  proscribed  places for the seesimple of the estates thereunto belonging  The outrages said to be committed nightly by the fairy generations exceed the pranks of that order of young fellows or old fellows with young follies known by the spirited names of bucks and bloods and their thefts and depredations about the country surpass those of the gypsey tribes with this aggravation too that there is no constable to take them up nor any justice able to make them keep the peace or commit them to the house of correction or even bind them over to better behaviour They are above all law and of course beyond the reach of an act of parliament which is certainly a great hardship on the Welch peasants who though overrun with them and put nightly into bodily fear can neither sue for trespass nor recover damages nor make them pay for an assault  Their malicious devises would fill as many folios as Sir John Hill's Vegetable System and their petty larcenies are as numerous And these are not confined to the neighbourhood of Pontipool but extend northward to the boundaries of the Principality I heard of their naughty doings again in Merionethshire Carnarvon and Anglesey not only the firm belief in their existence extending to these places but as thorough a conviction  that they are with very few exceptions as errant a pack of Little Pickles as any in the world and a kitten with a cracker at its tail or a bird with a string to its leg is more likely to rest in the hands of a parcel of schoolboys than a poor swain or damsel in the clutches of an offended fairy  It was impossible in these enquiries not to have often in mind the many beautiful descriptions of Shakspeare and my old friends Puck Peaseblossom and Robin Goodfellow were frequently playing their waggeries in my fancy but little did I suppose when I have been delighted with these personages that there was a part of the world appertaining to my own country where a countless number of really shrewd people believed as firmly in the existence and potency of these creations of superstition as in that of their God  I have forborn the relation of a thousand sad and merry fairy tales the result of my researches into this curious subject because one is as good as a thousand and that one you shall have here as a specimen of the rest  In my way to England I slept a night in the village of Festiniog and being the only traveller  then in the house had the choice of the bed chambers I fixed upon that which I thought the most commodious and after I had taken my solitary repast was preparing to retire when my landlady made her appearance and said that she could not answer it to her conscience to let me go to rest without telling me that the apartment I had chosen though the best in her house had the misfortune to be troubled by the fairies that had I been an ordinary stranger she should not have mentioned it but being recommended to her house by one of her best friends and customers she felt it her duty to apprise me of the circumstance after which I might do as I pleased She concluded this aweful intelligence by informing me she had soundly rated the chambermaid for her carelessness in shewing that apartment the door of which was never opened but when the inn was full of company and not another bed to be had  Whether it proceeded from that queer propensity in human nature to do what you are warned not to do or from a spirit of resistance to these simplicities of faith I do not know I can only tell you that my landlady's caution determined me not to profit by it I thanked her however for the hint and desired  to be shewn to the haunted chamber declaring to her at the same time that I had been so great an admirer of fairies ever since I read one of our great poet's account of them that I was perfectly satisfied they would rather look on me as an old acquaintance than a stranger and treat me as such and furthermore as it was excessive cold weather if fifty or an hundred of the little gentlefolks were disposed to pass the night with me they would be extremely welcome to part of my bed and I did not doubt butthat should this be the case I should be able in the morning to give a very good account of my bedfellows  For that matter Sir said mine hostess one of your great poetmen and who was a lord into the bargain took a fancy likewise to that very room where he slept three nights and past his days where you are now sitting after clambering up and down the mountains for hours together  Well and did  he  make any complaints of the common disturbers of that chamber  He was too mild and sweettempered a gentleman to make complaints about any thing but on my asking if he saw or heard more  than he wished or found his window thrown open or any of his things toss'd about the room or any pattering of little feet or in short any fairy work going forward He shook his head and said it was almost impossible for a man he saw plainly to be in the most retired parts of the world but he would be annoyed with busy bodies and impertinents that would be asking questions and forcing themselves uncalled into company This was pretty plain I think Sir  I think so too and will therefore go to bed landlady for you have mentioned a reason for my preference of that chamber that outweighs all the fairies of Merionethshire were they every one at this moment making merry in my bed the great poet you allude to was Lord Lyttleton I know he was at Festiniog and am glad to find that accident has conducted me to the same inn and even into the same apartment I have read what he wrote here  Aye he was always  scribbling  poor dear gentleman when he was within doors and when he was without he ran up and down hills and dales in such a manner though neither young nor strong that folks hereabouts thought him  a madman but his  valet de sham  told us he was only a poet and was making a book about us Welch people and our country tho' what he could find here worth putting in a printed book I cannot think yet he was quite beside himself with joy and often told my husband that we ought to think ourselves very happy as we lived in Paradise for that matter we do not live amiss considering a poor lone place we get fish and game of all sorts in plenty and now and then can shew a joint of meat with any body as your honour shall see if you should like to stay with us as long as the Poet Lord  Finding that the good woman had no other idea of Paradise than that we should there be sure of the best provisions and choicest rarities for the palate which idea is by the bye to the full as refined as that of numberless inhabitants in polite cities I again bade her good night and withdrew to the haunted chamber  I declare to you that the honest people who are terrified about these little fellows y'clept fairies never more earnestly wished they might be free from their visitations than I did for their appearance at the same time that I despaired  of being honoured by this fairyfavour Nevertheless I was kept some hours from the least desire to sleep the night was piercingly cold but it was about the third quarter of the moon whose frosty clearness threw into the apartment precisely that sort of elfinlight which these little personages are said to love and certainly if they have any human sensations about them or are at all sensible to the change of seasons on their tiny frames which by being so often seen in  propria persona  must be occasionally corporeal a snug birth in a warm bedchamber would be preserable to any thing they could meet with on the snowy mountains or in icy vallies I had talked myself and thought myself neither into expectation or hope yet whosoever follows up an enquiry of any kind with undiminishing ardour of curiosity will be less disposed to slumber than he whose investigations have attained their proposed end  As I lay in this wakeful state I ran over all the pretty things that have been said by our Poets on the fairy subject  I repeated aloud several of the favourite passages from the beautiful poems of Parnel in  his  "Fairy Tale" and in the "Ode to Indifference"  I invoked the sprites even by the Spirit of Shakspeare which I cannot but believe has a potency far superior to their own in this musing mood I remained till the peep of dawn when it is admitted that these children of darkness like all others of that cast and character  steal  off I therefore composed myself to a short sleep after which I rose with an intention to prosecute my journey  The very moment I got down stairs my landlady took notice that I looked very poorly and no wonder said she I was sure your honour could not sleep for all your  braggadosia  I heard you Sir talk to the fairies for half an hour together our rooms are parted only by a thin boarded partition I warrant you had your room full of them don't deny it Sir because I heard you speak to them as plain and indeed louder than I now hear myself nay if it had not been for fear I would have come and knocked at your door for they cannot bear to be surprised at any of their tricks  It seems I had been taken in the fact of reciting the verses which my landlady interpreted into addresses to the fairies for as to repeating at such a time of night and in such a chamber for my own diversion it could neither  enter voluntarily nor be driven coercively into her head without admitting at the same moment the most thorough conviction of my insanity Besides this there is something so unwelcome in combating any notion a person has taken up and is pleased with that I contented myself with leaving the matter open to the good woman's interpretation by saying in the words of Beatrice "I confess nothing and I deny nothing" It was therefore taken for granted that I had not only seen but discoursed with the fairies all night that I had intre ted them to be civil that I had begged pardon for not before having faith in them and that if they would spare me only that once I promised to build a temple for them to kiss their "tiny footsteps and to worship them for ever" To this effect did mine hostess construe the different recitations many of which you who are versant in all that our great bard and the minor poets have sung or said on the subject will recollect to be applicable to the occasion particularly the following passages  "Ye Elfin sprites  "Come now a roundel and a fairy song  "Come sing me now asleep then let me rest"  This my landlady said was begging what they never granted for they always broke  people's rest when they got into their bedchambers  After I had laid about an hour without any visitant I invoked Queen Mab herself and in language which had she been within hearing she must have answered in person or been looked on as a fairy of no taste or genius  "Thou art I know a spirit of no common rate  "Thou can'st give fairies to attend me strait  "Can'st bid them fetch me jewels from the deep  "And fing while I on pressed flowers do sleep  "Hop in my walks and gambol in my eyes  "Feed me with apricots and dewberries  "With purple grapes green figs and mulberries  "Steal for me honeybags from humble bees  "For my nighttapers crop their waxen thighs  "And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes  "And pluck the wings from painted butterflies  "To fan the moonbeams from my sleeping eyes"  Yes yes quoth mine hostess I heard you begging and praying them to fetch you fruit and honey but the deuce a grape or a morsel even of beeswax you get from them You soon was of that opinion too your honour I fancy for you gave them their true character soon after I judge she interpreted the malign properties attributed to them by our great bard in the subsequent lines which I remember I repeated with a sort of malicious energy as if  filled with their subject I felt myself piqued at their refusing to pay me a visit We know a thing is very little likely to happen and yet we work up our wishes to a warmth so fairylike as to be frequently displeased and disappointed that it does not Who has not found this unreasonable sally in himself  What will none of you appear ye little tormentors cried I in my soliloquising way  "This must be the spite  "Or I mistake of that shrewd knavish sprite  "Call'd Robin Goodfellow  "That frights the maidens of the villagery  "Skims milk and sometimes labours in the quem  "And bootless makes the breathless houswise churn  "And sometimes makes the drink to bear no barme  "Mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm"  I have heard of your pranks my little masters continued I and presume you are upon some now Each mischievously employed I warrant you  "Some to kill cankers in the musk rosebuds  "Or war with rearmice for their leathern wings  "To make them coats  And as for you Master Puck  "Up and down then up and down  "You are fear'd in field and town  "Over hill over dale  "Through bush through briar  "Orer park over pale  "Through flood through fire  "You do wander every where  "Swifter than the moon's sphere  "You do serve the fairy queen  "To dew her orbs upon the green"  Nay I have heard you boast you could  "Put a girdle round about the earth  "In forty minutes  My landlady told me they were capable of taking all shapes but she gave into the common notion of their tripping off at daybreak On her asking my opinion of this very gravely I with no less solemnity pretended to believe it in the general but that a very great poet in my country greater than her friend Lord Lyttelton and who had a mighty veneration for all these little persons declared that although many of them  "Wilfully exile themselves from light  "For fear that day should look their shames upon  "Yet there are spirits of another sort  "Who with the morning light have oft made sport  "Who like a forester the groves may tread  "Even till the eastern gate all fiery red  "Opening on Neptune with far blessing beams  "Turns into yellow gold his saltgreen streams"  Your fine poetmen seldom speak so as a poor body can understand them said the good woman all I know is our Welsh fairies are seen only at night but I am glad you believe in them or they would do you an ill turn before  you get home Now though I had as much belief in the wall and moonshine of Pyramus and Thisbe I pretended my faith was fixed I was a convert  By way of present comfort and future security however mine hostess promised me on my expressing a design to pass another night under her roof to put me into the yellow room to which she assured me the little tormentors had a particular objection Determined to humour the jest I affected to be highly satisfied with this and she then told me the story of a neighbour who had lost a chest of drawers and several other pieces of furniture which were found after many days above a league off upon one of the enormous druidical stones as at the top of an high mountain where added she not an hundred men could drag it and that therefore it must be  sprighted  away by fairies Upon my shewing tokens of surprise that these miserable Lilliputians should be more powerful than an hundred men my landlady informed me that it was all done by magic and that they had been known to move trees and carry away men and horses out of their warm beds and set them fast in the middle of a quagmire or drop them on a bare heath merely by charming▪ As I wish'd to see a little more of  this fairy land than was to be discovered through the windows of my inn I ended the conversation by observing to my hostess that this was carrying the slight of hand to a wonderful perfection indeed and it would be highly worth while for Messrs Jonas Breslaw and the other presto pass gentlemen who  live by enchanting  to come and make a few improvements in the art of magic or "delicate deceptions" as they have been called by the  professors  in conjuration  Such a fall of snow had happened in the night in addition to what was on the ground before that though the sun did the best that it could for me at that season of the year neither my old horse nor his master were disposed to proceed that day any farther at least together so I made a tour of the mountains and vallies on foot vehemently refusing all offers of a guide whom in a ramble of this kind I have all my life considered as an insupportable interruption for it is amongst my supreme pleasures to find out the wonders and beauties of nature with my own eyes to reason about them with my own understanding and to extract all the knowledge they are able to give me out of themselves before I ask other people who officiously tell you every thing  before you come to it and then it is ten to one but their account of the fact and the fact itself is at least as wide from each other as would have been my own unassisted conjectures besides that it deprives me of the  pleasures  of conjecture which are to an inquisitive mindthat is to a mind that likes to answer its own questionsalways something Moreover I have found these commonplace historians of the village or country to be not a whit more useful though full as learned as those biographers in great cities appointed to explain the wonders of St Paul's in London or St Peter's at Rome their explanations being nearly as illustrative of the objects as the elaborate commentators on the texts of Shakspeare or the Holy Bible The volumes of Nature and Religion my friend rarely require any of these darkling elucidations for both are so simple and so intelligible that in general he that runs may read and understand them and wherever there are difficulties in either they are usually made worse and more intricate by bungling guides who confound confusion For all these reasons I perambulated the environs of Festiniog alone and thus added another instance of my obstinate adherence to my own plans which produced  a portentous shake of my landlady's head  Just as I was going out of the door she hinted that the young peasant she designed to accompany me was thought a good  scholard  and could talk English by the hour together Had it been possible for my former resolution of being a solitary to have received any accessions of strength this intelligence would have the more determined me for the affectation of science amongst common people produces such insufferable jargon that it is even more nauseating than the pomposity of pedantry itself Had the guide only spoken Welch or been gifted with absolute silence he might have had his use just to keep me from two or three pitfalls into which I tumbled head over heels in course of my walk the snow having treacherously covered their surfaces But to escape these little casualties at the expence of having one's ears assailed by a  good scholard  while the stupendous works of Nature were inrolled in volumes before me by the Divine Author unsullied volumes that reached almost to the skieswould have been blasphemy For never surely in any part of his  creation  did the  Creator  display himself with more awful magnificence with more astonishing grandeur than  in the precincts of the little village of Festiniog on the day that I made my survey of it  This you are already apprised is the place the Summer dress of which Lord Lyttleton so agreeably describes He tells us that at the time he visited it it was in the perfection of beauty From the height of this Merionethshire village which is the most lovely one my eyes ever beheld you have says his Lordship a view of the sea the hills are green and well shaded with wood there is a delightful rivulet which winds through the bottom on each side are meadows and above are cornfields on the declivities of the immense mountains at each end are mountains still higher which seem placed there by nature to guard this charming retreat against any invaders With the woman one loves with the friend of one's heart and a good study of books one may pass an age there and think it a day If one has a mind to live long and renew his youth let him come and settle at Festiniog Not long ago there died there an honest Welch farmer who was an years of age by his first wife he had thirty children ten by his second and four by his third his youngest son was eightyone years younger than his eldest and eight  hundred persons descended from his body attended his funeral  My second visit to this happy vale in the spring justified the above luxurious account Its aspect when covered with snow gave to the respective objects a sublimity which  cannot  be done justice to but by the memories of those who have seen a country abounding with aspiring mountains and humble glens and every other grand irregularity of Nature under the domination of frost and snow These in flat countries present nothing but one uniform uninteresting waste amidst the mountains there is the cataract which resists the powers of ice the variety of ground that throws even the ice itself and the snow into a thousand fantastic forms the hardy peasants that brave the weather in a manner utterly unknown to southern regions the adventurous animals that impelled alike by the element and their appetite dig the shrub on the points of the rocks hunt for the perished herb through mountains of snow piled on the mountains of earth and an infinity of objects there only to be observed  Full of this kind of imagery I past several hours of the coldest day but therewithal the  brightest of winter The snow had drizzled for about half an hour but more radiant sunshine succeeded yet the frost was so much stronger than the thaw that the flakes encrusted on my hat and cloaths as they fell and I was as complete an icicle on my return to the inn as any of the surrounding objects  The surrounding objects indeed on my return were in perfect contrast to those without doors The whole peasantry of the village of Festiniog appeared to be got into the public house where the blazing hearth and vacant hilarity set frost and snow at defiance These happy groups are very frequent in North Wales and particularly in those seasons when the rigorous elements drive men more upon their internal resources This however was an extraordinary occasion The member for Merioneth in which county stands this sweet village had given a fat sheep and a barrel of homebrewed to the poor of every parish within his district to counteract the inclemency of the frost and this animal was roasting whole in the kitchen while the guests were gathered together in blissful expectation in a room adjoining All that could beat an alarm to appetite or give to appetite gratified its most perfect tranquillity was at work an harper  played the Triumph of Wales in one corner a poet sung his own compositions in imitation of the ancient bards in the other several Welch damsels joined in chorus the first foaming jug of ale was drank off to the founder of the feast the snow fell fast and was drifted on the windows and the warmth of heart that reigned within when the roasted sheep made its appearance was more than enough to baffle the rigour of a December in Siberia  You know enough of my disposition to be certain I mixed in these jovial doings with all my heart Without staying to be asked I saw that I was welcome I was in a land of hospitality and had I not been so the company were at the moment too replete with festivity to be churlish to a stranger Could one enter the house of a miser while he was enjoying himself on the bounty of a friend he could scarcely shut his heart to one that wished to be happy also Happiness is naturally benevolent and as the poor in their hours of relaxation are perhaps the happiest of the happy so are they when they have any thing to give the most bountiful of the generous Many of these willI have known them to do itshare their last shilling their last meal with a good  will as servent an urbanity and as courteous as if they were only dividing with you the superfluities of their ordinary table The poor of Wales are on all festive occasions the kindest of the liberal "I eat drank and was merry" and in process of the evening every gambol that health innocence rusticity and good fellowship let loose from toil could devise took its round Since the days of Cadwallader to those of the present Prince of Wales there never was seen a more comfortable set of human creatures on a more stormy night through which many of them had to seek their way to their habitations in the different huts that were scattered in the mountains or in the valley But this idea did not break in upon the present moments which were devoted to joys that in sweet oblivion absorbed the future You remember the winter evening of the English peasants described by Thomson It was now realized in Wales The charming lines came to my memory as I sat at the festival and they again recur at this instant they are at the end of my pen You would not forgive me for driving them back Here then let them flow on the paper  "Meantime the village rouses up the fire  "While well attested and as well believ'd  "Heard solemn goes the Goblinstory round  "The rural gambol and the rustic mirth  "The simple joke that takes the shepherd's heart  "Easily pleas'd the long loud laugh sincere  "The kiss snatch'd hasty from the sidelong maid  "On purpose guardless or pretending sleep  "The leap the slap the haul and shook to notes  "Of native music the respondent dance  "Thus jocund fleets with them the winternight"  After this harmless merrymaking which was certainly as pastoral as if it had been the arcadia of primitive times each departed to his home and were fenced within by hilarity and good cheer against all annoyance from without so effectually that I suspect it was neither in the power of frost snow or superstition to chill them Such are truly what my friend Goldsmith so poetically called  "The still small joys that ask but little room"  I do not know the time when I passed an evening more to my satisfaction nor when I crowned the night with a more quiet rest in despite of fairies and fairy tales May your's my friend this and every other night be as undisturbed after as pleasant days  LETTER XII TO THE SAME  IF we examine Lord Lyttelton's description of Festiniog shall we not think him a little unreasonable and in one or two passages not quite correct as to sentiment With the woman one loves the friend of one's heart and a good study of books there is surely scarce a man in the world whose mind is fitted to relish them but would convert Arabia Infelix into a Paradise There needs no such happy vales as that of Festiniog to render a person so environed with heartfelt resources more than content I argue that even in absence of these at least the last article many a year might pass without a weary moment No I renounce the thought in the very instant that I have made it I feel that if the study of books might be dispensed with the social bosom joys which the two other sources afford may not be given up His Lordship is in the right The charm of seeing others happy and being one of the party made me for a little while forget that the best part of their felicity proceeds from domestic happiness The men were surrounded by their families  and such as were not I remember had less jocund countenances and seemed "maimed of half their joys" On finding that the snow continued to fall violently had you seen how the mothers folded up their little ones and how the fathers forced their great coats on the shoulders of the mothers and almost stripped themselves to fortify their wives and loves against the cold in particular had you observed as I did how a young fellow after putting the handkerchief that tied his own neck on that of a lass whom he loved carried her in his arms to the merriment of the whole company and desiring every man to do as he did while in a frolic betwixt the tenderness and glee of their hearts they set off with the women in the same manner the mountains reverberating with the "long loud laugh sincere" you would have stood at the door as long as I did and been as little sensible of the cold  Ah my friend there is nothing to be long enjoyed in the absence of those who are dear to us I feel that I am renewing the happiness of the scenes I have been pleased with in my journeyings by describing them in correspondence to you and other of my friends nay I felt while they were passing before me that I  should again take delight in them when I prepared them for the post and I often have amused myself with thinking as I rode by a beautiful prospect met with agreeable people or gave way to the emanations of a tender disposition how strongly will I point and recommend all these to the friends of my heart  Pr'ythee tell me does absence soften the memory of injuries received Does it take off the edge of that indignation one naturally feels for those who have used us ungratefully I have left behind me now some hundred miles more than a few persons the recency of whose unkind thoughts and practices towards me ought to prevent my ceasing to think of them I do not cease to think but I think of them every day with less asperity My sense of their injustice is the same perhaps it is the more impressive the oftener it is reflected upon but there is something in my nature either so excessively tender or weak that without affectation I assure you if in the particular conduct of an avowed enemy one for instance who has said and done all that an enemy can or dare do and say there is on my recollection a single trait of goodwill or goodnature shewn to me prior to the date of his enmity and I have a memory very  faithful and retentive to kindness I fasten upon  that  trait as a fort of resource from the  pain  of thinking on the general tenor of his behaviour Nay if I have ever passed any happy days or hours in the society of those who have afterwards made me pass many comfortless or bitter ones it is not easy to express how I feel within me a propensity to sink the memory of the latter and take refuge in the former This I have reason to believe hath not a relish of benevolence in it because my ideas of the illtreatment I may have received are unaltered of course the persons of such as have occasioned it are no less irksome to thought but it is a great relief to me from that very misery of dwelling on the dark side of human nature where there is but a ray of light to turn it on the other For this reason though it is a selfish one perhaps I am hourly more convinced that I am not made for long resentments for to you and to God I declare that though I have not parted many years from some who I have reason to think seek to do me an ill turn for no other cause that I can recollect but that they have injured me too greatly ever to forgive me I cannot pay them in kind by meditating illwill or even ill wishes and though as I observed above there is neither "the milk of human kindness" nor  any other softening quality in all this but to get rid of the uneasy sensations that accompany even a just revenge or the contemplations which lead to and prepare it it is at least so far a greater felicity in temperature than the bias which disposes a man to brood over his wrongs and lie in wait as some minds have shewn a power of doing for months years half a long life till opportunity gives effect to accumulated vengeance To obtain at the end of only one year the most compleat revenge over those most injurious I would not exchange this constitutional gift of tenderness selflove or whatever you think fit to denominate this capacity of preferring pleasant to disagreeable reflections  I would claim a much greater degree of merit from the eternally unfading freshness with which I remember my absent  friends  did not their virtues talents or kindness to me preclude all sort of merit even on that subject and make that remembrance a simple act of justice But I may at least say that my memory of them is green and immortal as the laurel and triumphs over absence adversity and even over the more oblivious power that often attends on prosperity The deliberate traveller must either be worthless himself or associate only  with those that are of that description if in his route he does not find some who have demands on his admiration for their genius pity for their misfortunes or friendship for their good offices Of all these I have had my share but believe me none have or ever can have power to impair the sentiment with which I retain every impression due to those from whom I am separated My "untravelled heart" turns to them even when silence has been construed into neglect and I appear to have forgotten them Each of them comes to my memory with a fondness which often makes my heart ache that human life occupation and events permit not the power of giving as frequent expression to kind wishes as they are felt and excited In years of greater leisure and fuller health the delights of correspondence more than compensated for the quantity of time employed in sustaining it I neither seemed nor desired to have any other employment than to receive and reply to the letters of my friends Every post brought me the continued history of their joys and sorrows and I gave mine in return with an ardour that doubled the one and took from the other at least half its stings But alas the wants of health of time or of happiness  "check'd the genial current of the  pen"  which is an instrument of "the soul" Deep heavy and incessant too are the taxes which certain incidents of life levy upon us Many of these may make us sacrifice the sweetest occupations of the heart on the altar of more severe exercises but never have the  most  violent of these extinguished one spark of that tenderness I bear to those from whom I am divided and every hour proves to me that I recollect the virtues the talents and endearments of old friends as affectionately as if this maturity of my life was engaged like its earlier youth only in the exchanges of personal or epistolary professions Ah could my powers keep any pace with or bear any proportion to my inclinations on this subject a correspondence regular as that I keep up with you my friend should attempt the amusement of every other whom I love If by my silence I am suffering in the opinion of any on the idea of that silence being induced by motives less cogent than that deprivation of health leisure and spirits which make such frequent breaks in the lettered intercourse I carry on with you my loved friend and a very few others could they look into my soul at this moment could they enter into its thoughts almost every moment of every day they would not simply acquit me of  raising new friendships on the ruins of the old but confess that I reflected on their merits as warmly and on their failings when I thought on  them  at all as candidly as in the most glossy seasons of attachment  How have I rambled into these selfish developements Must I needs call them by so harsh a name In absence many delicate apprehensions assail us The very physician that recommended the exercises of my pen set very unsocial bounds to them for he knew that the very posture of writing was if long continued pernicious to that inveterate pain and malady in my breast which has so incessantly vexed me It stops the progress of my public engagements it continues to limit my private communications and though my mind and body are relieved when I can in any measure surmount these bosomevils and I am daily  gleaning  a little more of health as I go along I am never so churlish as to keep an unbroken hour to myself but invariably devote the best part of it to you and to others whom I appreciate and in the seasons that I cannot do this I at least  think  kindly of you  Accept then these pages of selfdefence for I know that the spirit of accusation has gone  forth against me on the article of correspondence and if any thing could induce me to believe your welcome flatteries as to the merit of these letters I should derive the greatest joy from the hope that if I adopt the proposal you have made of publishing them I might acquire a sensible gratification by uniting public with private favour  Forgive me and return with me to Festiniog or rather to my Lord Lyttelton's description of its attractions amongst which he seems to reckon  longevity  I fear however this is a complaisance he was disposed to shew the country Those who have long lived in towns assume the ideas and feelings of a poet happy though but for a few weeks or days to forget that they are men of the world Country churchyards are amongst the objects most travellers visit transiently and when we have tasted the rural breeze luxuriated in its prospects and been freshened by a change of air and objects we naturally enough conclude that we have left the abodes of disease langour and untimely old age and have at length found the regions of perpetual health and of life equally happy and long From experience nevertheless of the fallacy of supposing our "days of nature" are more in  number when past in the shade than amidst the "hum of men" I have regretted I know not how often that in this case as in many others truth and poesy are so much at variance  I usually pass an hour amidst the mansions of the dead in every town or village at which I pause and I am you know a pausing traveller I always have been such but if graves and tombstones are to be considered as the faithful registers of their respective parishes and I believe they are to be pretty much depended upon for all our little vanities are there useless and even the buried beauty there confesses her agethe village annals will I believe have little to boast of the antidote of zephirs or the anodyne of wholesome labour after undisturbed repose I have more than once had the curiosity in this country and in others both at home and abroad to compare the dates of life and death as they are stated in the burial grounds and if I have sometimes been inclined to think the country churchyard on a calculation of equal inhabitants the repository of fewer young and of more advanced old age I have on the general average found that the assertion of a celebrated tourist on this subject is founded in fact It is generally supposed says he that life is longer where there are fewer  opportunities of luxury but a cottager grows old over his oaten cakes like a citizen at his turtle feast A poor man is indeed seldom incommoded by corpulence Poverty preserves him from sinking under the burthen of himself but he escapes no other injury from time Instances of long life are often related which those who hear them are more willing to credit than examine To be told that any man has attained an hundred years as in the case Lord Lyttelton has related gives hope and comfort to him who stands trembling on the brink of his own climacteric Length of life is indeed distributed impartially to very different modes of life in very different climates and the mountains have no greater instances of age and health than the low lands nor can villages and small towns produce more examples than great cities on a comparative average Even in the villagereceptacle of the dead at  Festiniog  the infant the youth the mature man and the veteran lie mixing their ashes together and the instance which his Lordship has recorded is amongst the very few who have materially exceeded the human span  But in this little country there live those whom for the sake of human kind a benevolent traveller could not but wish he might continue in  the world till that world itself should be no more The snowclad mountains of Cambria my friend have not affrighted the spirit of philanthrophy from visiting their inhabitants nor has the thickribb'd ice that sometimes places an impassable gulph betwixt a man and his neighbour  "Frozen the genial current of their fouls"  The torrid zone boasts not more glowing hearts nor animated natures It would be an heresy committed against the beauties of the creation to leave Wales without visiting the several delicious domains that appertain to my Lord Powis and his family especially that part which is  emparadised  by Lord and Lady Clive I make free with that word as most expressive of the fact for the two noble persons last mentioned have literally raised a paradise around them but though you will see wood water hill and dale mansionhouses and cottages in the most enviable abundance all these are but secondary to another kind of beauty which is here to be seen in perfection Were you for example to make a circuit of the towns and villages adjacent to the seat of Lord and Lady Clive and enter every house where either industry indigence sickness sorrow or misfortune had entered before you you would hear the voice  or see the tear and smile of gratitude pouring forth the heartfelt praises of this noble pair I know not when I have past a more delightful hour than that which I spent on the road from Oakley Park to Welch Pool My eyes were gratified with every grace of nature and art in vegetable beauty my ears were regaled yet more voluptuously with a number of village annals that have made me think more highly of human nature ever since  I encountered one of Lord Clive's neighbours and here follow  verbatim  the answers he gave to my enquiries You are just to premise that we are jogging on in a very neighbourly way through his lordship's park on a fine day and in the finest month of the year and that having conversed sufficiently on the only acquaintancemaking topic which renders strangers companionablenamely the weather we struck into other subjects drawn principally like most conversations on the road from the surrounding objects  "Yes Sir" cried my associate in answer to a remark I had made on the beauty of the park through which we were as I said taking our way  It is full of good ground has some thousand pounds worth of good timber  a brave head of deer and game in abundanceAll these to be sure are good things but the folks to whom they belong are better than all of them I am not a prejudiced person never wanting a favour of lord or lady I never received one but from my own industry since I was born I therefore may speak  'No doubt you are an independent man'  As an independent man then I inform you that when either the lady or the lord to whom this domain belongs leave this world all the hearts within a score of miles round them ought to break for it As for my lady it would comfort your soul and make it better if it wants mendingbegging your pardonto see so fine so pretty and so good a creature go her rounds of lovingkindness sometimes on foot sometimes on horseback and stopping at every hut and cottage attended by all her children by way of making them take after her  'And what is the end of those circuits'  Nothing on earth but to make the poor rich the sick well and the sad merry I have often thoughtGod pardon mewhen I have beheld her ladyship and four or five of  her young ones open the door of a miserable dwelling which some of your great folks would not deign to look at that it was more like an angel from heaven and some little children who dying innocent became cherubims than human creaturesThen they are as affable as if the poor things they make comfortable were their equals and in short instead of spending their time at a lookingglass as thousands do who have not half such handsome faces to look at or their substance in the follies of the age they may fairly be said to keep a kitchen cellar and warehouse wellstored with good things for those that want them  That is strange indeed for commonly speaking to  want  the comforts which a fine house can supply is the only objection my good friend for withholding them for which reason I presume it is that the very knockers on the outside of the doors of great men's houses are held by the ironheaded lion tiger or some other beast of prey and that even if a poor visitor is so sorely impelled by necessity as to brave this emblem of severity  without  and having the hardiness to knock should thereby gain admittance  within  he has generally to encounter another beast of  prey in office whose orders are to suffer those only to gain entrance or at least to pass who bring no wants but those of which they can pay for the gratification Nay our town refinements are carried yet higher for as if neither the iron or brazenheaded monster before the door nor the Cerberus behind it were sufficient guards to repel the sighings of the sorrowful or the cries of the indigent the very history of a man's grievances either of mind body or estate are forbidden to obtrude themselves on the nerves and feelings of the great personages who inhabit these great houses and if a letter is not fashionably folded up superscribed in a style of fashionable illegibility and impressed with arms that certify the writer to be a petitioner for nothing but what he can purchase by some commodity equivalent to that he receives whether of courtesy or commerce the letter is thrown out of doors or referred to a reader of all papers suspected to be filled with the complaints of those poor devils who throw themselves on the barren soil of a great man's humanity All such papers being found guilty of containing tales of distress and petitionary representations of calamities of any kind are condemned to lie on the inspector's desk or be given up to the derision of the domestics who fatten in the  servants' hall but on pain of losing their places these pauper appeals and mendicant manuscripts are kept from the master and mistress of the mansion who cannot have their delicate sensibilities shocked by the miseries of their fellowcreatures and imagine that when they subscribe to the public hospitals in whose telltale books the names of the contributors are pompously and ostentatiously inserted they have fulfilled the whole duty of great men and women  The great people  I  have been speaking of continued my companion are not of that description I remember a passage in one of the Spectators the only books except the Bible and Common Prayer I ever read or ever shall read that just suits them and as I got it by heart when I was first struck with its force I will repeat it to you'If they have not the pomp of a numerous train they have every day they live the consciousness that the widow the fatherless the mourner and the stranger bless them in their prayers they give up the compliments which people of their own condition could make to them for the pleasures of helping the afflicted supplying the needy and befriending the neglected Thus keeping still to themselves  more than they want they give a vast refuse of their superfluities to purchase heaven and by freeing others from the temptation of worldly want carry a retinue with them thither'I could employ twice the time it would take us in getting to Welch Pool were I to tell you of onethird of the good things that I know to have been done by this noble family They apprentice out the orphans give portions to young women in marriage grant annuities to the widows put their old servants into farms on their own estate and though too often imposed on are still as bountiful as if they had never met with an ungrateful person  There was something in the  manner  of this my fellowtraveller so illustrative of the  matter  that both at once cooperating on my heart brought tears into my eyes which being perceived and the cause mistaken the honest historian of the place caught hold of my horse's bridle with one hand and of my arm with the other exclaiming  Perhaps you one way or other stand in need of the help of this noble couple for there are decayed gentlemen as well as decayed tradesmen and if it be so I should be very sorry that Lord and Lady C are both from home at this  time on a visit to Lord P I say I should be very sorry for this had not I a tolerable good house in the neighbourhood on t'other side Pool where you may wait the family's return which is expected on Saturday  The influence of a good great man's hospitality is more extensive than we imagine and it is in general a sufficient motive of virtue that it makes other emulous to "do likewise" Had time and circumstance permitted I would have humoured this honest man's misconception and gone home with him As it happened I could only very truly assure him the tears he observed on my cheek were those of pleasure and that though I was now constrained to take a different road if ever I again met him in the journey of life that pleasure would be increased and in the mean time I had a new source of most agreeable reflections for which I should bear an hearty goodwill to all the inhabitants of Okely Park and its environs while I had a being  Soon after this he turned up a bye lane which my companion said would take him a short cut across the country to his house which as it did not suit me to make a stop at now would be equally at my service another time  In the direct road I had about three miles to Pool from the place at which we parted and though the scenery merits all that travellers have said of it even to the luxuriant description which Lord Lyttelton has given of Powis castle which is the foreground object under your eye all the way I looked at it  then  almost without seeing it my mind's eye being employed on what excels in loveliness all the castles and prospects of the eartha good heart engaging itself in acts of gentleness and mercy  for the sake of goodness  A single deed described by my travelling companion in the daily benevolence of Okely Park is sufficient to overset the selfish systems of Rochfaucault Mandeville and all the herd of Satirists on Human Nature that ever sordidly narrowed its fair proportions for after all they can say Pope is right when he insists that selflove and social are the same Is not the pleasure you will receive even from the simple recital of so much real virtue purely benevolent Is not the gratification I feel in writing it a species of benevolence also and if either of us in the course of our day shall have added but a mite to the ease accommodation or comfort of any one mortal of even any one animal to which we have the power of doing good will it not strew upon our pillows  those roses which shall sweeten our repose and prove to us that it is not for our own sakes  alone  that we have "done that which we ought to have done" But I need not press this argument in defence of the motives of benevolence on you my dear friend whose whole life is a refutation of every attack that has ever yet been made on the  principle  that governs the social virtues Long very long may it continue to you a source of happiness Adieu  N B Whenever you visit WelchPool you will be called upon by Nature herself to visit Powis castle which is in its vicinity The noble owner being now frequently the inhabitant and having laid out in improvements more than the three thousand pounds which my Lord Lyttelton considered necessary to making it one of the most august places in the kingdom it commands the admiration of every traveller and justifies the poetical language which it has received in the following eulogy It stands on the side of a very high hill below lies a vale of incomparable beauty with the Severn winding through it and the town of WelchPool terminated with sublime mountains the opposite side is beautifully cultivated half way up and green to the top except  in one or two hills whose summits are rocky and of grotesque shapes that give variety and spirit to the prospect Above the castle is a long ridge of hills finely shaded part of which is the park and still higher is the terrace up to which you are led through very fine lawns from whence you have a view that exceeds all description  It will not give a bad finishing to this faithful though glowing picture to understand that Lady Clive and the Earl of Powis are of the same family and not more nearly allied in blood than by their virtues As you survey Powis castle you will think of this and feel every beauty of the place expand on your heart from the recollection  LETTER XIII TO THE SAME  YOUR affections are touched you tell me that you cannot pay due homage to the parks and castles I have described just at present but that you would take a pilgrimage to Okely barefoot and that you would do so were  Okely in the deserts of Arabia to offer the incense of a throbbing heart to the Lord and Lady of the domain You even bid me give you a post's respite from description adding that your heart is brimful and feels a bliss which edges upon pain from its excess I have obeyed you Four posts have past by during which you have been delivered up to the undisturbed enjoyment of your feelings Your letter of yesterday breaks the truce I had made with your heart by requesting me to proceedstill in conformity to your wishes I will go on but as you say your mind is even yet more open to the charms of philanthropy than accounts of fine scenery in which are to be seen only the charms of nature this is the moment as it is the place to offer you a little history which I have often intended to six upon paper and which deserves for its intrinsic worth to be engraven by the registering angel on leaves of adamant But in the very outset I have acted unskilfully for I have roused your expectation and wound up your curiosity before hand instead of taking them by surprize and thereby have rendered the gratification more difficult Your heart is prepared for its impression and to anticipate an emotion is to weaken it As an author I  have done wrong as a man you will pardon me I felt the force of the facts I was about to dilate too sensibly to be upon my guard My affections were too much warmed to think of taking your's captive by any stratagems of cold dexterity To write my letter over again would injure the glow that is now animating my bosom and would be an artifice something like practising on your sensibility Accept then the story just as it rises from my heart to my pen and without considering how much a more adroit arrangement of the incidents might have moved you take it as an instance of my love for you that I stand not upon the ceremonies of composition but give you my correspondence"warm from my heart and faithful to its fires" I have only further to promise that every sentence of the ensuing scenes records an unadorned unassisted truth and that the only injury they can suffer will be from the defects of the relation  A merchant of considerable eminence in London was reduced to the situation of poor Bassanio and from precisely the same run of illluck in his sea adventures  "The dangerous rocks  "Touching his gentle vessel's side  "Had scatter'd all his spices on the stream  "Enrob'd the roaring waters with his silks  "And not one vessel 'scap'd the dreadful touch  "Of merchant marring rocks"  To these miscarriages abroad were added fimilar calamities at home Several great houses broke in his debt and with the wrecks of his fortune gathered together he lest the metropolis and took refuge in the mountains of Montgomeryshire A little girl then only nine years of age his only surviving child was the sole companion of his retreat and smiled away his misfortunes The care of her education was his most certain relief from the corroding reflections of the past and the certainty of her possessing at his death sufficient to prevent a good mind from the horrors of dependence softened his thoughts of the future the present was filled up with the delights of seeing her ambition yet humbler than her fortunes and literally bounded by the objects that surrounded her To tend the flowers she had set with her own hand to nurse the shrubs she had planted to sport with and feed the lamb she had domesticated to see it follow her in her rambles and to listen to the melodies of Nature as they murmured in the waters or echoed through the woods were her chief amusements without doors and by a  thousand lovetaught duties to make a father forget that he had ever been unhappy or unfortunate her dearest study within Of her personal attractions I shall say little a single line of Thomson's gives the truest image of them and of the unaffected mind by which they were illumined  "Artless of beauty she was beauty's self"  It is not easy to be wretched in the constant society of perfect innocence the company of a beautiful child wholly unpolluted by the world affords one the idea of angelic association Its harmlessness appears to guarantee one from harm we reflect nay we see and hear almost every moment it is climbing our knees playing at our side engaging our attentions or reposing in our arms the words and acts of an unspotted Being and one can scarce be persuaded any real ill  can  befal us while a companion so like a guardian cherub is near When the babe is our ownsay ye parents how the sensation is then exalted Which of you having at your option the loss of the amplest fortune or of the feeblest infant would not cleave to the last and resign the former or if any of you balanced a moment would not one lisping word one  casual look turn the scale in favour of nature and make you think it a crime to have hesitated  Such were the sentiments of the merchant and under their chearing influence he lived many years during which a few mountain peasants an old relict of his better days as a servant who had been nurse to the young lady and his daughter were the only objects with whom he conversed So powerful is habit that we assimilate to persons places and things that on our first introduction to them we might imagine neither philosophy custom or religion could make supportable We are surprised to find we attach to them even to endearment In time even our former habits no less strong in us are but slightly remembered and those pursuits diversions and societies without which it once appeared impossible we should ever pass a day are yielded for others that it  then  would have been thought as impossible even to be endured Our merchant would have deemed the company of a monarch an intrusion and the jargon of the Exchange which had for so many years been music to his ears could not now have been borne I have here given you some of his own expressions At length he fell sick His daughter was then  in her eighteenth year the disorder was of a gradual kind that threatened to continue life after one has ceased to love it and to close in death He lingered eleven weeks and the old domestic being now superannuated and almost blind his daughter was at once his nurse his cook his consoler and might truly be said to make his bed in his sickness She wanted not the world to teach her the filial duties Her own pure heart supplied them all and her own gentle hands administered them But now for the first time of her existence she added to her father's anguish It almost kills me to look on you my only love cried he with an emphasis of sorrow and bursting into tears I am sure replied she falling on her knees at his bedside it has almost killed me to hear you say so and if it would make my dearest father better I would kill myself this moment and trust in God's mercy to forgive me Ah my child you mistake the cause and motive of my regrets resumed the parentthe thoughts of leaving you without protectionthere is the bitternessI am not going to be left said she rising hastily I have a presage you will be well soon and I am a great prophetess my beloved father Be in good spirits for I am sure you will recover I have sent to  Montgomery and Welch Pool and tomorrow I am to have the two best doctors in Wales  Your goodness is always a comfort my darling replied the desponding merchant but two thousand Welch doctors could not set me again on my legsIf indeed I was in a condition to procurebut that's impossible  Procure what Whom Nothing is impossible answered his daughter with the most eager haste  I have an idle and romantic faith in the only man in the whole world that knows my constitution and he is as far beyond my reach as if he were out of existence  Good heaven you mean Dr ****** exclaimed the daughter I have heard you often speak of his having twice before saved your precious life for which I have had him in my nightly prayers ever since and shall go on blessing him to the hour of my death O that I were a man to fetch him  The father pressed her tenderly in his feeble arms in acknowledgment of her affection but told her that from a multiplicity of other  claims it would be as impossible for the Doctor to get down to Wales as for himself to go out of his sick bed to London Do not therefore let us think of it my child continued the father since it is only the aggravation of a vain wish to know that it must end in disappointmentI am resigned  Notwithstanding this declaration the merchant receiving no manner of benefit from the Welch Doctors and being unable indeed to pay for their continued attendance without an injury to that scanty fund out of which he had to draw all the necessaries of life he often sighed out in a voice of pining as it were involuntarily the name of ****** The sound of that voice languishing for that which might possibly change its tone to gladness penetrated the soul of his daughter who needed not so pathetic a memento of her father's wishes to make her bitterly regret her inability to gratify them The poor gentleman grew worse and expressing a desire for something which he imagined might afford a momentary relief his Amelia so was the young lady named took the first opportunity of his being composed to go into the neighbourhood in search of a person to setch it from Montgomery A  little roadside publichouse about a mile from her father's cottage appeared the most likely place to find a messenger Thither she repaired and arrived just in time to take shelter from a sudden storm that fell with great violence At the moment of her entrance there were none but the old host and hostess in the alehouse but in a very few minutes after it filled with labourers and passengers who like herself sought protection from the hurricane during the fury however of which she had too much compassion to mention her wishes for she was amongst those whose nature would not suffer her to "turn an enemy's dog out of door at such a season" This necessary delay nevertheless greatly increased her uneasiness and she kept watching the rain and the hoped return of fine weather at the window Seeing no prospect of its clearing she determined to do that herself at all hazards which she could not ask another to performnamely to be herself the messenger to which end she desired to know whether the road she saw from the window was the nearest and most direct to Montgomery or to any other town where there was an apothecary's shop and what might be the distance to any such place  The affecting voice in which these questions were demanded and the prevailing appearance of the speaker gained her an interest in every hearer and beholder several of whom knew and acknowledged her for a neighbour mingling their expressions of goodwill with numberless kind enquiries after her sick father for whose languishing situation they unanimously declared their pity and regard and whose death if it should please God to snatch him away they should long lament  This last observation bringing to mind the image of her father's danger more closely the trembling Amelia lost all thought of herself or of the weather and thanking every body around her for their civility while her lovely face was covered with her tears she had got the latch of the door in her hand and was preparing to hurry out on her commission according to the directions she had received when a traveller who had not opened his lips during the conversation of the peasants but sat drying himself at the fire rose up suddenly and begged permission to speak to her She went with surprize and tottering steps into an adjoining room where he used to her these very words  "One of your neighbours young lady has told me you have been for many years the  best daughter in the world to the best father who has been once the richest though now the poorest man in Wales considering you and he are to be supported as gentlefolks It is plain to see there is a great deal of distress upon your mind and it is natural to guess the cause of it may be removed I am not by any means a wealthy man but I have had my share of evils sufficiently to make me feel for the unfortunate and I have always thank God a something to spare for the mitigation of honest distress in whatever country it is presented to my view I beg you will present this trifle giving her a bank bill with compliments begging the favour of his making use of it till it may suit his circumstances to return itI have no manner of occasion for it till about this time next year when I will call to ask after his health which I hope will long ere that be established and if it should not at that time be convenient to make restitution of the loan we will put it off till the year after when I will pay a second visit to you as I purpose passing through this country into Ireland where I have concerns annually I am now going to London"  The last sentence seemed to annihilate the rest The very name of London had at that  instant more charms for Amelia than it could ever boast of creating in the head of any Miss in her teens who had her mamma's promise to pass a winter amongst the sine folks and fine sights with which it abounds But it drew the attention of Amelia from superior motives It was the residence of her poor father's physician on whose heart she now resolved to make an attempt by the medium of the generous stranger who she rightly judged would suffer his bounty to take any direction she might wish and to whom she stated the merchant's anxious but hopeless desires  You have just the soul my dear friend to suggest the extacy of Amelia's on hearing that this muchwished for physician was an intimate acquaintance of the traveller and all the interests of an old affection shall be tried with the doctor exclaimed the stranger as soon as I get to town on condition that you will now go home to your father with this purse and as an assurance that although I am an  usurer  I will receive neither principal nor interest till he is very able to pay both  He did not give the astonished Amelia time to refuse but seeing the weather inclined to remit its rigours he put halfacrown into the  hands of the peasants to drink the young lady and her sick father's health and ordering his horse to the doormounted and proceeded on his journey  Does not your bounding heart assure you his feelings would have defended him from bestowing a thought on the peltings of the pitiless storm had they continued to rage And does it not also inform you that this fair pattern of filial piety was proof against the war of elements the sunshine of benevolence had indeed so animated her that its sudden and intense rays might have been too strong for her tender frame had they not been moderated by a shower of tears She had scarcely regained her cottage indeed when overcome by her sensations she fainted in the arms of her aged nurse who had been mourning her delay  Alas my friend what fragile creatures we are How much at the disposal of contrary events How totally the vassals of sorrow and of joy How little able to encounter the extremes of either But you will not easily forgive exclamations that detain you from poor Amelia whom I left in distress to indulge them My heart is but too often the master  of my pen and guides it as it listeth Let me hasten to make atonement by informing you that our lovely sufferer on her recovery had the pleasure to find her father had dosed best part of the morning and though he missed her from his apartment when he awoke he told the nurse that he hoped she was taking a little necessary rest in her own room where he desired she might remain undisturbed  This gave her opportunity to manage her good fortune of which she resolved to be so excellent an oeconomist that the supply she had received should answer the wisest and happiest purposes she recollected that the day before she met the benevolent stranger her father had received by the post a Bankbill to the amount of the quarterly division of his annuity of course a farther reinforcement was not immediately necessary on which account she had to regret that the flurry into which her spirits were thrown had hindered her from persisting in her refusal of the loan to the acceptance of which however she was somewhat reconciled when she reflected on the condition annexed to her borrowing it and an idea which just then started to her imagination of the manner in which it might be  propriated completely satisfied her feelings on the occasion She considered the gentleman's bankbill as the luckiest fund in the world to serve as the physician's see in case the generous stranger should prevail on him to come and to that sacred use her heart devoted it The sum was fifty pounds A recompence which her ignorance in the price of medical advice in the golden climes of England led her to suppose would be allsufficient for a journey down to Wales Alas were a regular charge to be made out by Doctors W R G F L or any other of the popular sons of Esculapius of London for such a tour from the grand mart of custom the l would scarcely be thought by those messieurs a more than sufficient sum to pay travelling expences In many parts of the continent indeed where a shilling value in coin that has less of silver in its composition than would be found in the analysis of a silver penny is received as a settled gratuity for running a German mile l would cut a handsome figure in physic and go very far towards curing a whole city of an epidemy so far as prescriptions could assist in its recovery  As however the visit of Dr ****** was a point rather "devoutly to be wished" than  expected it being the middle of a very hard winter Amelia thought it prudent to conceal the little adventure at the public house from her father whose malady nevertheless rather increased than abated and his love of life being in effect his love for his daughter he could not help oocasionally regretting his impassable distance from the only man by whose aid there might be a chance of resisting his disease There is you know a sort of superstition which often runs through a family in favour of its family physician Nor is it altogether without a support from reason since the person who has long been in the secrets of our constitution and familiar with our habits of living must in all general cases be better able to apply the proper remedies than he who is called into our bedchambers when there is a disease in it and when he sees us for the first time under its influence besides which an old physician is commonly an old friend and unites the lenitives of affection to the cathartics of science no wonder then that we have faith in him and faith you know is a great doctor in itself performing a thousand cures which the highest professional skill has not been able to accomplish without it  You will readily believe that the bountiful stranger did not break promise to Amelia He  kept it indeed so religiously holy that in less than ten days from the date of his departure our pious daughter received a message purporting that a person at the public house begged to speak with her You my friend whose fancy is ever warmed by your affectionate heart will immediately conclude what was concluded by Amelia that it could be only the muchdesired Doctor who had thus delicately to prevent the ill effect of surprize on the sick merchant announced his arrival If so you are in the right However inconsistent with the spirit of business such a long journey might be it was perfectly in unison with the spirit of benevolence by which Dr ****** was moved to determine upon it the instant the case was stated to him and to execute what he had so determined with all the dispatch necessary to an affair of life and death and the life and death moreover of an old and unfortunate friend My good little girl said he on the entrance of Amelia who gliding from her father's bedside with Sylphid steps ran with duteous haste to the village innMy good little girl I am come from Heaven interrupted Amelia falling on her knees you are come from heaven to make my father wellUnder the auspices of that heaven I trust I am resumed the Doctor Let  us fly this instant exclaimed Amelia in the animated accents of naturelet us do all things in order replied the Doctor in the language of friendly discretion otherwise we shall do more harm than goodI presume I am not expected Amelia bowed a negative Then my sudden appearance would make thy father worse child continued the Doctor No go back to him and by telling him an old friend of his from London and who has particular business in that part of Wales which he inhabits means to pay him a visit on the score of ancient amity and will take cottage fare from him in his chamber The name of this old London friend will then be a matter of amuseing conjecture in the midst of which thou child mayst suggest that thou shouldst not wonder if it were me telling him as much of the adventure that I find happened at this inn between thee and the gentleman who brought me thy message and with it the story of thy virtues and misfortunes to support and to relieve which would have brought me ten times as far but we have no time for profession I am come here to practise so fare thee well my good little maidAll that I have premised will be the work only of an hour at the end of which I will be with thee  She kissed his hand servently and without speaking a single word sprung up and might rather be said to fly than run to the cottage though the paths thereto were lost in snow Her father was sitting up in his bed supported by pillows which the aged adherent had made shift to place in the absence of his filial nurse who gently chid the old woman for taking her proper business out of her hands but that if her dear father had found a moment's ease by this usurpation of her natural rights she would then forgive the usurper She then entered on her errand which she managed so well as to make the old friend's name after much pleasant conjecture on both sides the subject of a wager the father observing that if it should prove to belong to the Doctor Providence had sent him to reward the virtue of his daughter who on her part maintained that it would be chiefly owing to the value which heaven itself would set on her parent's life This amicable strife had put the invalid into unwonted spirits and thereby perhaps not only prepared the way for the cure of a fever on the nerves but laid the best foundation of it The poor gentleman did not dare to lay any stress on the possibility of a visit from the physician and yet a faint blush of  hope denoted that he should think himself most happy to lose his wager  At this auspicious crisis it was that our Doctor made his entrè saying as he advanced to the bedside "My esteemed friend I am come to return my personal thanks to thee for having me in thy thoughts when thou wert too sick to remember any but those who are dear to thee and of whom thou hast a good opinion Give me thy hand and without entering into long histories let us see if in return for thy kindness I can make thee well again Yes this pulse I foresee before I have done with it  Shall temperately keep time and beat  More healthful music  Those eyes have I see still the spirit of life in them and this heart shall yet bound with renovated enjoyments"  The emotions of Amelia during these favorable prognostications no words can tell you The merchant was strongly affected The Doctor perceived that his patient was recoverable both in the maladies of body and mind and as he was no less a philosopher and philanthropist than a physician he could with equal skill prescribe for each He was one of the  people called Quakers and to a perfect knowledge of the world of his profession and of the human heart united all the honest plainness of the character The merchant's disorder was as I have said a fever on the spirits of which the symptoms were as usual want of apperite lassitude watchfulness and dejection of mind a pulse slow and creeping difficulty of respiration and a dread yet hope of death  I need not tell you that in this disease the cathartics of the mind such as exhilerate enliven and amuse the patient are the most effectual remedies and such as were administered with uncommon success on the present occasion In less than a fortnight the sick man not only was in a condition to leave his bed but his chamber and play his part in the little cottage parlour in a thousand little frolics that Amelia and the Doctor devised to entertain him in the course of the third week he resumed his accustomed exercises and under the cordial supports of his friend and his child he could ascend the mountains that environed his habitation In the middle of the fourth week his spirits and strength were so well restored that in returning home to dinner after a walk of some miles he jocularly proposed to run against the Doctor and Amelia for a  wager which being agreed upon by the other parties he set off and beat them both It was in the afternoon of this victorious day that the good Doctor intimated the necessity of his return to town goodhumouredly observing that although by a lucky arrangement he had left his sick and wounded in very good hands with a brother physician in London he could not trespass any longer without fear of being set down by the college as a deserter and he must therefore repair to head quarters in the morning  The reasonableness of this was admitted yet the merchant sighed and Amelia wept The Doctor knew it must be done and he saw that his prophecy as to his friend's recovery was fulfilled to his heart's content but there is a sympathy in generous regret and his eyes were not more dry than Amelia's In despite of exertions the evening past heavily away the morning did not rise without casting clouds on every countenance The hour the almost instant that was to separate the cottagers from their preserver approached  Friend said the Doctor to his patient as he heard the wheels of his carriage advancing since I saw thee last in the great city I have  prospered exceedingly All those families to whom thou tookest me by the hand were more for thy sake than mine on  my list  Some merit however or infinite good fortune I must needs have had since from an yearly gain of one hundred I have increased my income to several thousands per annum and yet I do not take fees for one in forty of my prescriptionsMy house is too large for my family Wilt thou come once again into the busy world with this mountain blossom and occupy some of the apartmentsThis as thou wiltAt present I must give thee a few words of parting advice and must rely on this damsel to see that it is adopted Thou art so much thy former self friend that I fear not a relapse but to fortify and strengthen thee in my absence I have written and made up a prescription which I am convinced hits thy case exactly Hearing something of thy maladies from the friend who conveyed to me thy Amelia's message and forming a judgment soberly thereupon I brought with me such drugs as I thought could not be readily procured in thy neighbourhood They lie however in a small compass even in this little box yet being compounds of peculiar strength they will last you I judge for at least a year to come probably moreif they should not  thou knowest where to address the prescriber for a fresh supply There friend take it but do not open it till you seem to wish for something of a  cordial  nature It will then I have no doubt do thee good  He received their tearful embraces and departed You are impatient to lift up the lid of the box When it was opened by the merchant and his daughter they discovered two separate pieces of paper each containing a draft on a different banker for  one thousand pounds  the one a present from the physician the other from the stranger who had given him an account of this little family Wrapt round these drafts was a slip of paper in the Doctor's handwriting containing these words "Tributes from the friends of filial piety and parental love"  I must not deny you the gratification of knowing that the father recovered and the child added to his blessings and her own many years in the smiling course of which the young lady's virtues attracted the affections of a very wealthy and worthy gentleman whose power and inclinations not only enabled the merchant to make restitution of the generosity received from the physician but to make also  the residue of that man's life from whom he derived the best and loveliest of wives as happy in prosperity as it had been respectable in misfortune  There is an air of romance about this little history better suited to the spirit of the days of chivalry when to sally forth in  quest  of the unhappy and of the oppressed and to relieve them was a vital part of the educationnay and even of the religion of a gentleman than to the present times which though perhaps not less distinguished for liberal actions than any age whatsoever less encourages that  quixotism  in benevolence which marked the character of former aeras On  your  heart I need not press my repeated assurances of the simple truth of the above transactions You will easily credit words and deeds of which you are yourself so capable indeed to  your  feelings there will be nothing surprizing in all this for you will follow the good old rule of judging others by yourself Nay I am persuaded that the wonder will cease and die away in every heart you think fit to make partaker of these  facts  when given to understand that they proceeded from a physician who was the means of converting an highwayman who had  violated  the public  faith into a man who was afterwards chosen to  guard  the public faith by holding a place of the highest  trust  in one of the public treasuries of his country and that the Doctor's colleague in the bounty shewn to our merchant and his Amelia was no less a benefactor to human kind than the late Mr HOWARD who happened on the day that he was driven for shelter into the village inn which was then graced with the presence of Amelia to be returning to England from one of his usual  tours of benevolence  to the different prisons of Ireland and Wales My friend farewell  LETTER XIV TO THE SAME  SINGULAR indeed that you should be perusing the account of the death of the philanthropist mentioned in my last at the moment that you received my letter and that on the morning of the same day you should have fallen in company with Dr ****** of whose tour of loving kindness I had prepared for you so ample a detail  Things of this sort are occasionally so welltimed that there seems more in them than our  philosophy can find out It is impossible to hear that the King of Terrors has taken out of the world one of the best that ever entered it for such Mr John Howard unquestionably was without quitting one's subject whatsoever it might be at the time of receiving such intelligence and fastening upon that which adds a fresh proof to the certainty of that hour which is appointed for our own dissolution The loss of the dearest objects one by one as they drop from us makes perhaps the approaches of that hour less formidable inasmuch as we thereby feel our ties to life diminished The friendly intercourse that subsisted betwixt me and the good Howard is amongst those pleasures of reflection which though at the present moment dashed by painful regrets will be cherished for ever I picked up many things respecting him well worthy of my gleaning hand in the course of our conversations some of which I should send you were I not certain that there will be more than a plenty of biographers follow fast upon his funeral and more lives like more last dying speeches is an evil that is levied on every great man's ashes A few only of his particular habits as they occur at the moment shall wait upon you  Howard had many singularities but very few affectations It was singular for mere mortal man to go about doing good for the sake of doing it to devote his fortune and his life to explore the most neglected and the most forlorn of the wretched and to relieve them "according to their several necessities"to  begin  the work of benevolence where other people's bounty commonly  ends  it in a prison All this I say was very singular but wholly pure of affectation Further it was singular deserving that word indeed inasmuch as in human historyit is without a parallelto put himself to the greatest personal inconveniences and to encounter the greatest dangers often of life itself to accomplish the proposed ends of his philanthropy since it is notorious that he traversed the earth without any consideration of political distinctions or the nature of climate in search of his objects by which perseverance and intrepidity of resolution he overcame all impediments that would have deterred many excellent persons from attempting the like enterprizes and made even those faint by the way who with like good hearts but with less firm minds would have found themselves unequal to like undertakings yet in Howard this was altogether unaffected and before any man sets  down any part of it to a love of being particular or to a love of same arising therefrom let him well and truly examine his own heart his own disposition and see that he is not hunting about for an excuse to his own  want  of benevolence or to his own  vanities  in being bountiful by lowering the  principle  of benevolence in another Let it not be imputed to John Howard as a dishonour that he had enemies who while they could not but applaud the blessed effects of his virtue laboured to depreciate the cause the Saviour of the whole world whom perhaps of human creatures he most correctly imitated had the same and to resemble his divine example even in the wrongs that were heaped on his sacred head is rather glory than shame  He was singular in many of the common habits of life for instance he preferred damp sheets linen and cloaths to dry ones and both rising and going to bed swathed himself with coarse towels dipped in the coldest water he could get in that state he remained half an hour and then threw them off freshened and invigorated as he said beyond measure He never put on a great coat in the coldest countries nor had been a minute under or over the time of an appointment so far as it depended on himself  for six and twenty years He never continued at a place or with a person a single day beyond the period prefixed for going in his whole life and he had not for the last sixteen years of his existence are any fish flesh or fowl nor sat down to his simple fare of tea milk and rusks all that time His journeys were continued from prison to prison from one groupe of wretched beings to another night and day and where he could not go with a carriage he would ride and where that was hazardous he would walk Such a thing as an obstruction was out of the question  There are those who conscious of wanting in themselves what they envy in others brand this victorious determination of suffering no let or hindrance to stop him from keeping on in the right way as madness Ah my friend how much better would it be for their neighbours and for society were they half as mad Distractions they doubtless have but it is to be feared not half so friendly to the interests of human kind But indeed all enthusiasm of virtue is deemed romantic excentricity by the cold hearted  With respect to Mr Howard's personal singularities above described though they were  certainly hazardous experiments in the first instance it was not useless for a man who had preresolved to set his face against wind and weather and after passing all sorts of unhealthy climes to descend into the realms of disease and death to make them  Some days after his first return from an attempt to mitigate the fury of the plague in Constantinople he favoured me with a morning visit in London the weather was so very terrible that I had forgot his inveterate exactness and had yielded up even the hope for his own sake of expecting him Twelve at noon was the hour and exactly as the clock in my room struck it he entered the wet for it rained torrents dripping from every part of his dress like water from a sheep just landed from its washing He would not even have attended to his situation having sat himself down with the utmost composure and begun conversation had I not made an offer of dry cloaths c  Yes said he smiling I had my fears as I knocked at your door that we should go over the old business of apprehensions about a little rain water which though it does not run from off my back as it does from that of a duck goose or any other aquatic bird  it does me as little injury and after a long drought is scarcely less refreshing The coat I have now on has been as often wetted through as any duck's in the world and indeed gets no other sort of cleaning I do assure you a good soaking shower is the best brush for broad cloath in the universe You like the rest of my friends throw away your pity upon my supposed hardships with just as much reason as you commiserate the common beggars who being familiar with storms and hurricanes necessity and nakedness are a thousand times so forcible is habit less to be compassionated than the sons and daughters of Ease and Luxury who accustomed to all the enfeebling refinements of feathers by night and fires by day are taught to feel like the puny creature stigmatised by Pope who shivered at a breeze All this is the work of art my good friend nature is more independent of external circumstances Nature is intrepid hardy and adventurous but it is a practice to spoil her with indulgencies from the moment we come into the worlda soft dress and soft cradle begin our education in luxuries and we do not grow more manly the more we are gratified on the contrary our feet must be wrapt in wool or silk we must tread upon carpets  breathe as it were in fire avoid a tempest which sweetens the air as we would a blast that putrifies it and guarding every crevice from an unwholesome breeze when it is the most elastic and bracing lie down upon a bed of feathers that relax the system more than a night's lodging upon flint stones  You smile added Mr Howard after a pause but I am a living instance of the truths I insist on A more 'puny whipster' than myself in the days of my youth was never seen I could not walk out an evening without wrapping up if I got wet in the feet a cold succeeded I could not put on my shirt without its being aired I was politely enfeebled enough to have delicate nerves and was occasionally troubled with a very genteel hectic To be serious I am convinced what emasculates the body debilitates the mind and renders both unfit for those exertions which are of such use to us as social beings I therefore entered upon a reform of my constitution and have succeeded in such a degree that I have neither had a cough cold the vapors nor any more alarming disorder since I surmounted the seasoning Prior to this I used to be a  miserable dependent on wind and weather a little too much of either would postpone and frequently preventnot only my amusements but my duties and every one knows that a pleasure or a duty deferred is often destroyed Procrastination you very justly called the Thief of Time And if pressed by my affections or by the necessity of affairs I did venture forth in despite of the elements the consequences were equally absurd and incommodious not seldom afflictive I muffled up even to my nostrils a crack in the glass of my chaise was sufficient to distress me a sudden slope of the wheels to the right or left set me a trembling a jolt seemed like dislocation and the sight of a bank or precipice near which my horse or carriage was to pass would disorder me so much that I would order the driver to stop that I might get out and walk by the difficult places Mulled wines spirituous cordials and great fires were to comfort me and keep out the cold as it is called at every stage and if I felt the least damp in my feet or other parts of my body dry stockings linen c were to be instantly put on the perils of the day were to be baffled by something taken hot going to bed and before I pursued my journey the next morning a  dram was to be swallowed down to fortify the stomach In a word I lived moved and had my being so much by rule that the slightest deviation was a disease  Every man continued Mr Howard must in these cases be his own physician He must prescribe for and practise on himself I did this by a very simple but as you will think very severe regimen namely by denying myself almost every thing in which I had long indulged But as it is always much harder to get rid of a bad habit than to contract it I entered on my reform gradually that is to say I began to diminish my usual indulgencies by degrees I found that a heavy meal or a hearty one as it is termed and a chearful glass that is to say one more than does you good made me incapable or at best disinclined to any useful exertions for some hours after dinner and if the diluting powers of tea assisted the work of a disturbed digestion so far as to restore my faculties a luxurious supper comes so close upon it that I was fit for nothing but dissipation till I went to a luxurious bed where I finished the enervating practices by sleeping eight ten and sometimes a dozen of hours on the stretchYou  will not wonder that I rose the next morning with the solids relaxed the nerves unstrung the juices thickened and the constitution weakened To remedy all this I ate a little less at every meal and reduced my drink in proportion It is really wonderful to consider how imperceptibly a single morsel of animal food and a teaspoonful of liquor deducted from the usual quantity daily will restore the mental functions without any injury to the corporeal nay with increase of vigour to both I brought myself in the first instance from dining upon many dishes to dining on a few and then to being satisfied with one in like manner instead of drinking a variety of wines I made my election of a single sort and adhered to it alone  "In the next placebut I shall tire you"  I intreated him to go on till I either shewed by words or actions that I was weary  He proceeded thus  My next business was to eat and drink sparingly of that adopted dish and bottle My ease vivacity and spirits augmented My cloathing c underwent a similar reform the effect of all which is and has been for many years that  I am neither affected by seeing my carriage dragged up a mountain or driven down a valley If an accident happens I am prepared for it I mean so far as respects unnecessary terrors and I am proof against all changes in the atmosphere wet cloaths wet feet night air damp beds damp houses transitions from heat to cold and the long train of hypochondriac affections  Believe me we are too apt to invert the remedies which we ought to prescribe to ourselvesfor instance we are for ever giving hot things when we should administer cold On my going down to my house last week in Bedfordshire the overseer of my grounds met me with a pail full of comfortable things as he called them which he was carrying to one of my cows which was afflicted sorely with as he called it a  racketty  complaint in her bowels I ordered him to throw away his pail of comforts and take to the poor beast a pail of cold water Cold water your honour exclaimed the man with every mark of consternation Would you kill the poor dumb creature Why she is in such  desperations  pain that I don't think a bucket of sheer brandy would have any more effect upon her than if I were to pour  it against a dead wall No matter for that said I take her a pail of water Suppose honest friend she had all her life run wild in a forest and fell into the sickness under which she now labours dost thou think that nature would ever carry her the hot comforts you have got in that pail Nature your honour but with submission nature must when either man or beast is sick be clapped on the back a little if not nature will let them die Not she truly if they are recoverable she will on the contrary make them well Depend upon it she is the best physician in the world though she has not taken her degrees in the college and so make haste to throw away what is now in your pail and fill it as I directed for whether my cow die or live she shall have nothing but grass and cold water Though the poor fellow dared not any longer resist I could see plainly that he put me down as having lost not only my senses but my humanity However the cure did very well and I am satisfied that if we were to trust more to nature and suffer her to supply her own remedies to cure her own diseases the formidable catalogue of human maladies would be reduced to a third of their present  number Dr Sydenham I think reckons sixty different kinds of severs for example of these I cannot suppose less than fifty are either brought about or rendered worse by misapplication of improper remedies or by our own violation of the laws of nature And the same I take it may be said of other disorders  He now pulled out his watch telling me he had an engagement at half past one that he had about three quarters of a mile to walk to it that as he could do this in twenty minutes and as it then wanted seven minutes and almost an half of one he had exactly time enough still to spare to state the object of his visit to me  Which is to thank you very sincerely said he taking my hand for the honour you have done me in your verses I read them merely as a composition in which the poetical licence had been used to the utmost poets you know my dear Sir always succeed best in fiction  You will see by this conversation that it was about the time when the English nation had been emulous of commemorating their respect for this great and good man by erecting a statue towards which I had contributed  my mite by devoting to the fund the profits of my little Poem called "The Triumph of Benevolence" and while I am touched very sensibly with even the recollection of the public favour which crowned this little work I very sincerely attribute a great deal of its success to the popularity of a subject in which every lover of humanity took such an interest  In reply to Mr Howard I assured him that he ought to be and doubtless was conscious the liberty allowed a poet was never more unnecessary or less made use of than on the occasion alluded to and that if an agreeable fiction was any test of the poetical art I could pretend to none from having very closely as his heart could not but at that moment tell him adherred to truth and that I assured myself he would admit that truth was the same whether expressed in prose or verse I added it was my earnest hope there was no ground for an idea that had gone forth of his refusing the offering of gratitude which his country were preparing for him  Indeed but there is answered he with the most lively earnestness I was never more serious than in my refusal of any and every  such offering and for the simplest reason in the world namely my having no manner of claim to it What I do have done or may hereafter do is has been and will always be matter of inclination the gratifying which always pays itself and I have no more merit in employing my time and money in the way I am known to do than another man in other occupations Instead of taking pleasure in a pack of hounds in social entertainments in a fine stud of horses and in many other similar satisfactions I have made my election of different pursuits and being fully persuaded a man's own gratifications are always more or less involved in other people's I feel no desire to change with any man and yet I can see no manner of pretension whereon to erect a statue beside all which I have a most inconquerable aversion and ever had to have public exhibitions made of me insomuch that I protest to you it has cost me a great deal of trouble and some money to make this insignificant form and ugly face escape a pack of draftsmen painters c that are lying in wait for me    Unless you had personally known Mr Howard it is impossible you should have the smallest idea of the pleasant manner with  which he spoke on his own personal subject  I have detected a fellow at work upon this face of mine ugly as it is said he even as I have been walking in the streets of London and if a hackneycoach has been within call I have popped into it drawn up the blinds and sat snug till I got to my own door and then I have leaped out and run into my own house as if I was apprehensive a bailiff was at my heels Nay I have often had my door itself infested by a lurking artist who was literally in wait to take me off But one day since my return a trick I played one of these takers off diverted me excessively You must know I am a great gaper at the novelties that are continually presented at the printshops in this great city I was standing at that of Carrington Bowles in St Paul's Churchyard the other day to look at some political caricatures very pleasantly executed when happening to cast my eye sidelong I discovered a fellow operating on my phiz with all his might Perceiving himself caught in the fact he lowered his paper and pretended to be like myself and a number of others looking only at the prints I was just then in the humour to pay off this deception by another so seeming like him to be wholly  engrossed by a figure called Scotch Oeconomy well calculated to provoke the risible muscles I threw mine into such contortions and gave such sudden changes from one deformity to another that had my painter etched any one of my features in its then position the resemblance betwixt my actual self and the copy would have been just as striking asI could desire it to be The painter however at length perceived the stratagem and smiling as if he gave me credit for it put his pencil into his pocket and went away I own I enjoyed the joke and have since practised it more than once with no less success  You will doubtless throw these sallies amongst his singularities my friend but they are by no means to be stigmatized as affectations From a very intent observation on Mr Howard I am perfectly satisfied that as he had but few who  acted  like himself the proportion of those who  felt  in the same way the ordinary results of such actions were not greater That he was insensible to honest praise cannot be supposed without depriving him of emotions which the most ingenuous modesty may indulge and which are indeed amongst the most natural pleasures of the human mind but  to court the  reputation  of benevolence by suffering the lucre of it to mix with any of his motives or still worse to make it as alas too many people do a first great cause of being bountiful argues an envy or a depravity in those who impute to him such vanities In a word if ever a human being could be truly said to "do good and blush to find it fame" it was the late Mr John Howard  I presume you have heard that amongst his other singularities is to be enumerated his generous care of his superannuated horses He had a range of pastures sacred to the old age of those who had carried him pleasantly or worked for him honestly and industriously till they were no longer fit for service This is the moment when horses are in general either sold at an under price to people who are constrained to allow no touch of pity to predominate over that charity which begins at home or else they are destroyed and given to the dogs their masters alledging that it is an act of humanity Our Philanthropist's humanity never leading him to kill an old servant he turns his useless horses into the aforesaid pastures where they remain happy pensioners on his bounty for the rest of their lives  I was much delighted on walking over those grounds with the generous master of them to see twenty or thirty of these quadruped pensioners enjoying themselves in perfect freedom from labour and in full supply of all that old age requires Each of the fields has a comfortable shed where the inhabitants can resort to in the hard weather and are sure of finding the rigours of the season softened by a wellfurnished crib of the best hay and a manger either of bran or corn ground or some other nourishing food Chelsea hospital is not better accommodated the day on which I made the circuit of the pastures was one of the finest of August some of the pensioners were renovating in the sun others reposing in the shade but on the approach of their benefactor all of them actuated by a spirit of gratitude worthy of imitation that could move with ease came towards him invited his attentions and seemed very sensible of their situation Some whose limbs almost refused their offices put themselves to no small difficulties to limp towards him and even those who being confined to their hovels might be fairly said to be bedridden turned their languid eyes to him and appeared sensible of his pity and caressings  These have been all very faithful creatures Sir said he and who have strong claims upon me that poor fellow who has now scarce a leg to stand upon was the constant companion of my peregrinations for six and twenty years and was as proud and prancing as he is now humble and decrepid and the iron grey invalid which you see yonder dragging his slow length along was in the days of his youth such a roving riotous fellow that no gate or hedge could keep him within bounds and it was a day's work sometimes to catch him nay when he was caught it required more address and horsemanship than ever I was master of to make him understand that the philosophy of a parson's pad had more charms for me than all the flights of Bucephalus or even of Pegasus himself Look at him now The morality of the contrast is obvious  In this manner he went on enumerating the several qualities and historical anecdotes of the several pensioners The one last described he told me  was at no time a horse for him and would not probably have been amongst his pensioners but that he had been once rode by a relation of his a young agreeable rake  who valued him for the very points that made him useless to me his skittishness and impetuosity all which he asserted were the sure marks both in man and beast of a generous spirit high heart and noble disposition Now as my little frolicloving cousin was precisely of this character himself and after a mad but not vicious career of fifteen years consolidated into a very good man I suffered the horse and his master to reform themselves at leisure and wish with all my soul that half the reformed rakes about town had turned out so well after sowing their wild oats as did this young gentleman and his favourite steed who for the eight last years of his servitude was a pattern of sobriety to horses and riders  I do not recollect any other singularities respecting this extraordinary man but if what I have here set down gives you a curiosity for more I have no doubt but it will be amply gratified as there needs no ghost to foretel us there will be an historian for almost every anecdote and incident in his life Luckily he is one of the subjects which can never be exhausted and as Dr Johnson once said to me of his friend Goldsmith"he was one who cannot be too much praised or lamented" And  never perhaps was the famous expression of Hamlet more applicable though quoted on ten thousand occasions than to Howard  "He was a man take him for all in all  "We may not look upon his like again  LETTER XV  TO THE SAME  IT is a very high satisfaction to give you pleasure it increases my obligations to you for it increases my happiness Your last letter therefore wherein you express so vivid a sense of the Howardine scraps I sent you could not but be most welcome neither can I refuse the flattering compliment you pay to my muse in desiring a copy of the tributary verses she paid to our Great Philanthropist at the time that the British empire which he so much adorned and dignified was preparing its memorial of national exultation You tell me that you have applied to the booksellers and to the publisher of that little poem in vain Had I known your wishes I could have prevented your having any trouble to gratify them on this occasion having long known the poem was  out of print and as long been applied to for sending it again to the press but the sale of the former editions having answered the end of something enlarging the fund which was intended to defray the expences of the statue and that design being suspended by Mr Howard's wish that it might not be carried into execution I considered that the subject was too local to warrant a republication when that locality was taken away amongst a few partial friends therefore I distributed the copies that remained of the present which was made me by the committee who published the poem and reserving only a single copy for myself I thought no more about it The death however of the meritorious man who was the subject the report that prevails of the committee's completing a design which can no longer affect the delicacy of Mr Howard the pleasure I take in obeying your commands and the desire I have to preserve my tribute to this excellent character in my correspondence with you united with the confidence which the approbation of the world on the original publishing gives me are all motives so persuasive that to combat with or to resist them might appear an affectation more unpardonable than the indulgence of my vanity at a moment when it is connected with my duty to the dead my  friendship for the living and my gratitude to the public It is under such supports and suffrages I republish in this place my dear friend "THE TRIUMPH OF BENEVOLENCE" not however from the reserved copy I spoke of but from memory that copy being amongst the manuscripts missing or lost stolen or strayed with my trunks who as well as myself have been upon their travels but by a set of  contretems  have not been my  fellow  travellers I hope however as amongst other matters they contain the literary labours of some years not yet published including the materials for "Society" on which the public have a claim I hope I say we shall meet ere it be long like old friends and part no morethe rather as some of the characters in those unfinished performances are left in a very forlorn situation out of which no hand but mine can properly extricate them A heroine is in a a deep swoon and a hero at his last gasp in tragedy but can neither die or recover without my assistance two whole families are thrown into a labyrinth of perplexities and have no chance of extrication but from the author who involved them but who was "cruel only to be kind" In short all these good people are wandering in their several distresses and look to me only for consolation  join with me therefore I beg of you that they may speedily be conducted from the  cross  roads of lifepardon the pun for the sake of having the philosophy of sport with my misfortune and by making use of the enclosed clue help me to set them in the right way  I am this moment interrupted in my design of transcribing the poem which however shall wait on you shortly In the mean time look into your own generous heart for all those principles of affection and sympathy you bear me and be assured while you survey them you are looking at the faithful counterparts of those which animate the breast of your friend  LETTER XVI TO THE SAME  THE TRIUMPH OF BENEVOLENCE  I  WHAT lofty sounds through echoing Albion rings  What raptur'd notes as if by angels giv'n  What thrilling airs as from celestial strings  Pour in full tides the harmony of heav'n  II  From public gratitude the notes arise  To honour virtuous Howard while on earth  While Providence yet spares him from the skies  Th' enduring statue shall record his worth  III  Lo Albion's ardent sons the deed approve  Wide o'er the realm to spread the generous flame  A spirit like his own begins to move  And all the virtues kindle at his name  IV  This this the moment Britons ye should chuse  While the fair act no modest blush can raise  The good man's absence shall our love excuse  And give the godlike luxury of praise  V  By heav'n commission'd now our patriot flies  Where Nature scourges with her worst disease  Where Turkey's plaguedevoted victim lies  And spotted deaths load every tainted breeze  VI  With love unbounded love that knows no fear  Wherever pain or sorrow dwells he goes  Kindly as dew and bounteous as the sphere  His social heart no poor distinction knows  VII  Ah what is friend or foe to him whose soul  Girding creation in one warm embrace  Extends the faviour arm from pole to pole  And feels akin to all the human race  VIII  To all the human all the brutal too  Bird beast and insect bless his gentle pow'r  From the wor'n steed reposing in his view  To the tame redbreast warbling in his bow'r  IX  Well may the spirit of the isle arise  With loud accord its best good man to grace  Well may the statue point to yonder skies  And call down cherubim to guard the place  X  Ye pomps of Egypt moulder fast away  Ye Roman vanities your arches hide  Ye Gallic pageantries profusely gay  Ye tombs ye triumphs here resign your pride  XI  Notnot to grandeur tow'rs our destin'd bust  No muse we bribe a sordid wreath to twine  Round the frail urn of infamy in dust  Nor bid our incense deck a villain's shrine  XII  Nor yet to pride the venal statue raise  Preserving ashes virtue had forgot  We bid no trumpet sound a bad man's praise  Nor memory restore what time should rot  XIII  Nor to the slave of gold though largely grac'd  With all that wealth or folly could bestow  With all that vanity on dust could waste  Living and dead alike fair virtue's foe  XIV  Nor yet for thee thou tyrant of the plain  Illustrious scourge and butcher of mankind  Whose murthering hands whole hecatombs have slain  Thy glory gathering as it thins thy kind  XV  Not even to thee O Frederick tho' thy name  Idol of Prussia now is breath'd in sighs  Tho' foremost in the list of sanguine fame  Exulting vict'ry claims thee in the skies  XVI  Ah no the monument our love would rear  Is to the man of peace who may descend  Ev'n at this moment into dungeons drear  The prisoner's guardian and the mourner's friend  XVII  To noxious caverns and abhorrent caves  Deepscooped vaults and slowconsuming cells  Where wretches pace alive around their graves  And hollow echoes ring their endless knells  XVIII  To scenes where all th' antipathies assail  Which instinct reason nature most would shun  Haunts of the filthfed toad and slimy snail  Behold the friend of man undaunted run  XIX  Ev'n now perchance he bears some victim food  Or leads him to the beams of longlost day  Or from the air where putrid vapours brood  Chaces the spirit of the pest away  XX  Where deadly venom poisons now the gale  The newborn zephirs soon he bids to glow  Where the heart sickens soon shall health prevail  Where the lake stagnates living waters flow  XXI  For who Benerolence thy power shall bound  Thy guide the God of what should'st thou despair  Let vice still deal her desolation round  Virtue shall rise the ruin to repair  XXII  That may destroy but this was born to save  And while the warrior lays a nation low  While one proud Caesar would the earth enslave  One humble Howard would a heav'n bestow  XXIII  Lo as by touch divine before him flies  Fever that seizes on the burning breath  The icy power that kills with shivering sighs  And thirst unquenchable that drinks its death  XXIV  And torpor wrapt in his Lethean fold  And swoln Convulsion with his eyeballs strain'd  And purple Tumour loathsome to behold  And plaguestruck Phrensy foaming unconstrain'd  XXV  All these defended by no Theban charm  No mail save that which purity supplies  Our Christian hero meets without alarm  And at each step some giant mischief dies  XXVI  Quit Prussia quit thy Frederick's crimson shrine  With olive garlands join our whiterob'd band  At Howard's statue how unlike to thine  Full many a sainted form shall duteous stand  XXVII  At thine perchance shall loftier trophies rise  The regal banner and the blazing car  Sculpture more gorgeou  emblems shall devise  And adulation gaudier rites prepare  XXVIII  High o'er the tomb the storied war shall glow  The black'ning siege and desolated tower  The victor's carnage redden all below  To mark the bloodtracks of ungovern'd power  XXIX  Rage glory havockall the soldier train  Their spears inverted shall in marble frown  Unnumber'd captives clank the brazen chain  And death himself embrace a favourite's urn  XXX  Then as in martial pomp the youths pass by  Ev'n the cold tomb shall kindle hostile fire  To arms to arms each madd'ning chief shall cry  And Frederick's ashes future wars inspire  XXXI  Yet ah not laurell'd youths nor chiefs alone  To Frederick's sanguinary shrine shall go  For there the execrating  ire shall groan  And there the orphan melt in filial woe  XXXII  There shall the virgin with affliction wild  At dead of night explore the monarch's tomb  The wailing matron claim her murther'd child  Whose ghost shall rise to meet her in the gloom  XXXIII  There the pale shade shall join her deep despair  And fill with loud complaints the sounding aisle  Fierce from the vault the pageant trophies tear  Conquest deplore and spurn th' accursed spoil  XXXIV  Welcome thrice welcome Prussia to the pride  The mould'ring honours of the grave afford  Britain from these indignant turns aside  Wooes private worth and leaves the scepter'd lord  XXXV  The muse no vain idolater disdains  Proud of her trust to prostitute her fires  Let minions waste on power their meteor strains  Till flatt'ry nauseates and till echo tires  XXXVI  The sweet memorial of one gentle deed  One pang prevented or one wrong redress'd  A generous morsel at the poor man's need  A sorrow sofren'd or a sigh express'd  XXXVII  One artless rhime a record small and dear  That graves these virtues on the village stone  Where love retires to shed th' unwitness'd tear  Surpasses all that ever armies won  XXXVIII  O panegyric if thy Frederic's name  One peaceful tribute has to mem'ry given  Direct to that th' uplifted trump of fame  For that when tombs are dust shall mount to heav'n  XXXIX  And ah behold what visions of the skies  Rob'd in the pure serenity of light  To consecrate our Howard's statue rise  And mark the holy spot with fond delight  XL  Mercy her lightest footsteps here shall bend  Fearing to crush some harmless insect near  Humanity her fost'ring wing attend  With pity softly smiling thro' her tear  XLI  And charity shall come with Seraph air  And pleasing melancholy pace around  And warm Benevolence be ever there  And Christian meekness bless the hallow'd bound  XLII  Here too some mortal visitantsthe wife  Parent or child restor'd their joys shall tell  Here sharp remorse shall wail a guilty life  And hardness learn for human woes to feel  XLIII  With pious offerings hither shall repair  What once was want contagion and disease  Restor'd to all the liberty of air  Here shall they hail the renovating breeze  XLIV  And dissipation as he passes by  Abash'd that vice has ravish'd all his store  Conscious shall drop the penitential tear  And spurn the follies which deny him more  XLV  And avarice too shall here suspend his art  His bosom loosing from the sullen ore  The statue shall subdue his niggard heart  And the rock gush in blessings to the poor  XLVI  And envy devious from her wonted plan  Taught by the statue even a foe to save  Shall tell her snakes to spare one virtuous man  And own his goodness e'er he reach the grave  XLVII  But should some bloodpolluted hero come  Flush'd with the crimson waste his sword has made  Meek Howard's statue on that sword shall gloom  Till tears shall seem to trickle on the blade  XLVIII  And many a wondering traveller shall pause  To hail the land that gave a Howard birth  Till jealousy itself aids virtue's cause  Prompting the spirit of congenial worth  XLIX  Here too the willing muse shall oft retire  To breathe her vows in many a graceful line  From the blest statue catch sublimer fire  While inspiration hovers o'er the shrine  L  Thou to whose praise these honours gather round  Receive this tribute from thy country's hand  Thou who alike by vice by virtue crown'd  Accept the homage of thy native land  LI  And tho' the memory of thy deeds shall bloom  When sculpture's proudest boast shall be no more  When urns like what they guarded meet their doom  And time o'er Adamant exerts his power  LII  And tho' thy modest goodness shuns its right  Tho' blushing it would shrink from just applause  Unseen would bless like show'rs that fall by night  And shew th' effect while it would hide the cause  LIII  True to the awful charge by justice giv'n  Fame still will follow with her clarion high  On rapture's pinion bear the sound to heav'n  Nor suffer virtue such as thine to die  LIV  And well that wondrous virtue has been sung  In deathless lays by Briton's lofty bard  Hymn'd by a lyre that seraphs might have strung  For Hayley's muse has giv'n her fair reward  LV  But feeble all that mortal man can raise  Feeble the trump that peals each honour'd name  Feeble a Hayley's lyre a nations praise  And all th' applausive note of human fame  LVI  Yet take our pledge tho' mixt alas with earth  Then hear the prayer that whifpers in thy breast  That voice from heav'n alone can speak thy worth  A recompensing God will give the rest  My friend I have obeyed you It is pleasing to me at this moment to reflect that I enjoyed the friendship of the valuable and extraordinary man who gave birth to these verses I thought so while I had the benefit of his conversation but I think of it now more feelingly as a benefit I can partake of no more How infinitely touching is an idea of this sort of deprivation How anxiously does the soul fly about for succour on such occasions She takes refuge in a thousand circumstances little attended to while the good we have lost was in our possession We take a retrospect of the discourses which have past between us and the friends deceased the very places where we met are in a manner consecrated their persons manners accents are before us We kindle ourselves into an enthusiasm of forrow but feel that such "sorrow is heavenly" it literally lifts us above the earth it truly and necessarily sets our affections on things above we are moved we are awed And after all but for these warningsthese proofs of the "attenuated thread" on which hangs the life and death of what is precious what careless arrogant  wretches should we beHow independent even of heaven itself Alas with all these checks are we not sufficiently headstrong presumptuous and vain and instead of being as the solemn poet of the night finely calls us the pensioners of an hour do we not seem proudly to think that time and space are our vassals and that instead of being in a few years possibly in a few moments vanquished ourselves is not the crest uplifted as if we could put all things under our feet  LETTER XVII TO THE SAME  ANCIENT manners are less worn away by time and the varying modes of life in Wales than in most other countries There is a harper in almost every village and more than a bard to every mountain The poetical enthusiasm has descended from the earliest to the latest generation with no loss of its original fervor at least for the Cambrian poets have monthly meetings and annual festivals on which there is a strife in rhime which makes the very rocks poetical I received a card of invitation to one of these and was much amused with the novelty of the ceremony About a hundred and thirty bards  assembled at a public house in the village of Penmorva in Merionethshire Twelve judges were appointed to decide of the superiority of the poems the six best of which were to have prizes the one an armchair decorated with the ensigns of Apollo a second a chaplet of laurels bespread with gold leaf and so on only fiveandtwenty bards were to recite and each recitation not to exceed twenty minutes This I soon found was a very proper restriction for had the poesy been equal to the vehemence of delivering it had the sense echoed to the sound Phoebus himself might have been proud of his votaries It was however a very merry association and though only half a dozen could obtain prizes every man went away about daylight well satisfied with others and with himself for if each happy candidate was pleased with present success each unlucky one was whispered to by his selflove that the next meeting would atone for the disappointment Thus  "Not a vanity is given in vain"  and we are to be convinced of every thing but our want of merit in the art we cultivate This good opinion of ourselves is not only to be reckoned amongst the painted clouds that beautify our days but incites us to industry and emulation in the science or occupation we pursue  The bards of old are too famous and you are too well read in their story as it has been given in modern and ancient performances to stand in need of much information Old Caradoc Craddock of Lancarvon whose book was originally written in British and  published  in English by Doctor Powel as it is quaintly called has furnished the best as well as the earliest account of them and it appears that one of the ancient Princes of Wales named Gruffydth Griffith ap Conan who died about the year to the grief and discontent of all his subjects amongst other wholesome laws and statutes enacted in his time reformed the disorders and abuses of the Welch minstrels  Of these minstrels there were three sorts the first composed several songs and odes of various measure wherein says Craddock appeared not only the poet's skill but also a vein which the Latins call Furor Poeticus These of the first order likewise kept the records of the gentlemen's arms and pedigrees a very sacred trust amongst these descendants of Cadwallader in former times on which account they were held in great veneration both by their brother poets and by the people The next were such as played upon instruments of music chiefly the harp and the crowd the latter of which  Prince Griffith who descended from Irish parents and was born in Ireland brought over with him from that country and who not contented with giving his Welch subjects the instrument sent over for some of the best performers upon it and although the Welch contend for the honour of the invention it seems to belong principally to those very Hibernians The last sort of Welch minstrels and bards were to sing to an instrument played by another Each of these by the same statute held their several rewards and encouragements allotted them their life and behaviour was to be spotless otherwise their punishment was very severe every one on proof of a wellfounded complaint having authority to correct them even to a deprivation of all they had They were also interdicted entering any man's house or to compose any song upon any one without the special leave and warrant of the party concerned  These regulations gave virtue to amusement by adding morality to music and poetry It must be confessed that although the harmony as well social as vocal and instrumental still remains in a certain degree the morality so far as sobriety and temperance is a part of ethics is a little the worse for wear The orgies  of Bacchus generally finish those of Apollo at the festivals of the modern Welch minstrels who after the poetic trials of the day eat and drink like so many aldermen at a turtle feast Formerly bard and minstrel united in the same person at least frequently at present the harper and the poet are for the most part distinct The poet like the harper is still welcome wheresoever he goes they both migrate in a pleasant wandering kind of life from one place to another making sometimes a circuit of their neighbouring hills and vallies and sometimes of the whole principality They travel with the harp at their backs or their works in their pockets They enter a house without invitation and are considered as one of the family while they stay which is seldom less than a week at a time If any little domestic incident happens while they are inmates it is celebrated on the spot if the event be fortunate the bard greets it by a gay and spirited impromptu and the harper hails it with his most lively ditty If it is distressful they commemorate it by an extemporaneous elegy and attempt to soften it by soothing sounds The marriage of children the death or sickness of parents a fair prospect of harvest an untimely frost and in short almost every change and chance of human  life is either gratulated or bewailed This practice is not without its use it excites to good neighbourhood it prevents the industrious labourer as well as his employers from wandering abroad for those relaxations and recreations which they find at home The village hinds and husbandmen can have a dance and song at their own cottages and farms and all the family is regaled invigorated and amused at a very small charge merely that of the occasional entertainment of the bard and harper on a scale of comparative expence how much cheaper as well as more free from hazard is this than the county town balls to which the highdressed farmers daughters repair monthly in chaises or on their brothers' hunters in all the extravagance of the latest fashions ridiculously imitated In a word those musicopoetical vagabonds are a very happy and useful set of people and it is wonderfully pleasant for a residentiary traveller particularly if he is also a perambulating one to be sure not only of hospitable reception but to be gratified with music and song into the bargain wheresoever he makes a pause for it may very truly be said in this country that "every stranger finds a ready chair" With respect to myself I have to render my acknowledgments even to some of  the untoward accidents of life for carrying me into several agreeable scenes and adventures for instance a shower a sudden turn of weather from intense heat to cold or  vice versâ  a considerable distance from a town or inn thirst hunger or the want of any thing that offers but the shadow of an apology for making another's house my own has often been matter of felicitation to all parties and I have sometimes sought the shelter of a few minutes but found it impossible to quit it for days The harper always gives a zest to every meal by a tune and in the evening the bard though often an unlettered votary of the muse offers the best poetry he has to bestow The brevity and dispatch are recommendations in the worst of times for while a jug of ale or cyder is drinking the bard will make a stanza of gratitude for it While supper is dressing he is ready to serve it up with a copy of verses in praise of Benevolence And though it may happen that neither the music nor the poetry have charms for the fastidious critic they are not destitute of attraction for the philanthropist  The northern part of the principality is said to have been the most famous at all times as it is at present for the bards A very curious contention indeed is reported to have  taken place betwixt the North and South poets in Lord Rhys Rice Prince of South Wales says the history made a very great feast at Christmas in his castle of Abertrifi which he caused to be proclaimed through all Britain Ireland and the islands adjacent some considerable time before and according to his invitation many hundreds of English Normans and others were very honourably received and courteously entertained Amongst other tokens of their welcome the prince caused all the poets throughout all Wales to come to his castle and for a better diversion to the company he provided chairs to be set in the hall in which the bards being seated they were to answer each other in rhime and those that overcame the rest in this pitched engagement of poetical repartee were rewarded with rich presents The North Wales bards obtained the victory with the applause of the whole company and amongst the harpers also between whom there was a similar strife the prince's own servants were accounted the most expert  You may be sure I did not fail to include amongst the objects of my most accurate attention the most attractive of all that Cambria in ancient times most venerated the Druids  In my researches on this fruitful subject though I was very highly gratified I found nothing sufficiently new to glean A tour through Anglesea which I made in the company of a very intelligent man who luckily for my purpose was mounted on a horse that like my own had long since adopted the mode of deliberate travelling presented to me a full view of all the reliques of druidical antiquity still to be seen in the island The places of sacrifice where the blood of human victims was devoted by craft to superstition the enormous pile of rocks under which they erected their sanguinary altars the now craggy heaths once covered with their temples and the remains of those immense woods wherein they performed their tremendous rites were all visited with an eagerness of curiosity which the subject is so well fitted to inspire I really felt a sacred kind of horror as I traversed the isle celebrated for so many ages as the theatre of religious rapine and although at every step I was reminded of some act more characteristic of an assassin or of a murderous banditti than of the ministers of a religion pure and peaceful at every step I experienced that solemn sensation which mixes itself with every object of antiquity over which poetry has thrown a charm The power of the muse  is manifested perhaps more in this than in any thing else In that sober state of the mind which fits us for seeing objects in their natural size and colour whether we are reading or reflecting a fact is decided upon by reason and pronounced either good or evil according to its actual tendency From this decision one would suppose there could be no appeal presently there comes a fair usurper called Imagination who by the slightest wavering of her wand hurls reason from the throne vaults into it herself and governs with a sovereignty at once so absolute and agreeable that we deliver up ourselves to her enchantment and even assist her in dragging the lawful monarch at the wheels of her chariot in which we suffer ourselves to be carried over fairy land the happy slaves of her usurped authority  Thus only can we account for the veneration we bear towards those whose memory is stained by deeds which reason must for ever condemn I was not to learn that the Isle of Anglesy was the chief haunt of those barbarous beings whose despotism and cruelty surpassed the rage of the panther famishing for prey that a more bloody race of ruffians never infested humanity than the Druids that they  covered the most horrid enormities with the impenetrable mask of religion and yet so effectually had Mason and other poets assisted our love of antiquity to make us go over to the side of imagination that I honoured the very name of Mona and looked at the reliques of the woods and caves which had so often resounded with the mysterious incantations with a not unpleasing horror Thus fascinated  "Ev'ry old poetic mountain  "Inspiration breath'd around  "Ev'ry shade and hallow'd fountain  "Murmur'd deep a solemn sound"  and even in places where had the mind been unseduced I should have shuddered at the bare remembrance of the enormities practised therein  "Brightey'd fancy hov'ring o'er  "Scatter'd from her pictur'd urn  "Thoughts that breathe and words that burn"  Such are the triumphs over the muse We are called reasonable beings my friend but how vast is the empire of imagination and how sweet is our captivity What a pity that it should so often be false and fatal To you may fancy ever be a friend and in connection with reason or if they ever separate be it only like the parting of muchloved associates  who make short excursions to different places but return soon into the arms of each other or while fancy carries you into adventures may Mentor ever attend on Telemachus  LETTER XVIII TO THE SAME  TO the superstition of the Welch  mountains  may be added that of their  lakes  and monumental stones The former are extremely numerous but a countless variety of fables mingle in the history of each The stones are of such prodigious magnitude that they are not likely to be moved but by that commotion which shall subdue the world itself they are of such incredible bulk that it is astonishing by what united power they were at first dragged to the cloudcapped hills on which they stand and have stood for many centuries A traveller who tells you the single stones measured from seven eight to ten and sixteen feet high is modestly within the truth and it is also true that fifty yoke of oxen could not possibly move some of them much less climb with them up the fearful ascents whereon they certainly were originally placed by human art  and labour No wonder therefore that the traditionary account of the peasantry is that the devil himself set them up there And of the mountains themselves on the very summit of which these enormous stones are piled one upon another it has been justly observed their resemblance is so great to the Alps that except the language of the people a traveller could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from Grenoble to Susa or through the country of the Grisons but with this exception that in abundance of places you have the most beautiful vallies in the world and some of them of very great extent far exceeding those so famed amongst the mountains of Piedmont and Savoy  The Welch are of a most inquisitive temper They stare and flock round a stranger as if he were the inhabitant of another world just arrived amongst them If he makes the slightest advance to discourse they ply him with questions and are never satisfied with answers till they unlock every part of his history At first I took this to be confined to a few curious people but I found in the end it was the custom of the country You meet a Welchman on the road or join him in the chat of a minute at your inn"Whence come you where go you what is your name where were you  born what is the object of your journey are you in business are you out of it how long have you been from home how long do you stay abroad are you a single man have you a family" are interrogatories that tread on the heels of the first salutation and these if replied to are followed by others more close and if possible more impertinent Nor have you any way of shaking the enquirers off but by an inveterate silence and this they resent by such a torrent of fresh queries that even silence is no security and you must either bear to hear all they have to ask or take refuge in retreat Horace's troublesome fellow was not more importunate But all this is without the smallest intention to offend on the contrary it is often with a design to be sociable but chiefly I believe has no motive better or worse than the gratification of simple curiosity It is however very worrying and has now and then provoked me to answer sharply At a place called Towy a man whom I met at the inn where I baited so urged me with question upon question that I was malicious enough to put the most bitter sarcasms into my responses QuestionWhere did I come from Answer The other world Where was I goingOut of hearing What was my nameNameless Where was I bornIn the moon  Till this answer the fellow did not seem to feel that I was laughing at him but it had the effect for he soon after ended his persecutions by saying come from where I will I was a merry gentleman and he wished me good day  If ever you should be sprighted by one of these Welch querists or by a vexer of this description in any country my plan may be worth adoption You might be led to suppose this overcurious propensity was in the way of their hospitable turn of character but if you can agree with me that it originates not in any suspicion or fear of deceit you will place it in the long list of  inconsistencies  which blend in human characters without conceiving it to be a paradox How often do we meet the most apparently nay absolutely incompatible properties compound themselves in the same mind avarice with prodigality pride with humility charity with selfishness vanity with diffidence and a love of the world with profound retirement I could illustrate each of these apparent contradictions by proofs  personal  taken from the catalogue of our mutual acquaintance but what better would be inferred than so many fresh convictions of the oldest fact that the best people re strange compounds  and that the world is a garden where not only in a  general  sense  "Weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot"  but where by the side of the fairest sweetest flower and almost twisted round it grows that weed which is most baneful to it one would think they could not live or thrive in the same soil yet we perceive they flourish very neighbourly together Have you never my dear friend found the rose and nettle take root in the same temperthe fragrance and beauty of the one incommoded by the stinging properties of the other Yes you reply but then it is the business of the gardener Education to pluck up this illassorted associate and to leave the rose to blossom either in solitude or better society In vegetable culture this may always do in moral gardening it is to be managed nicely lest in eradicating a favourite folly or constitutional weakness we injure the native virtue that is near it No my friend we must be content rather with meliorating the soil than destroying its natural productions if some of these are utterly obnoxious to the valuable plants and shrubs which are the pride and riches of the ground they  "must  be hewn down and cast into the fire" for  such  "tares will totally choak the wheat  "such  weeds will blast  the rose worse than a canker but if they are less ambitious of doing mischief if they are all but the frailties of our nature springing up amongst our virtues let them be considered as forming the tissue of the human character where the coarse and fine the worsted and the silk are necessary to the general strength of the piece  "When strawlike errors lean to virtue's side  "Ah check ye bigots check your surious pride  "Some venial faults from sordid nature start  "And spring up only in the generous heart  "As florid weeds elude the labourer's toil  "From too much warmth and richness of the soil  "While meaner souls like Zembla's hills of snow  "Too barren prove for weeds or flowers to blow"  SYMPATHY  Your pardon for this selfish quotation Is it not in point It repeats perhaps the allusion but it seems to gain force by the repetition It is so excessively painful to be finding fault with poor human nature continually that it is quite a relief to one to plead her cause and become her apologist for those trespasses which are at all defensible Heaven knows there are plenty of  faux pas  where to attempt her excuse would be to partake her crimes  Be satisfied then that the constitutional hospitality of the Welch receives no check  from their constitutional inquisitiveness the former is indeed so very general that the story which a gentleman who made the tour of Wales in relates is not in the least to be doubted It is told to shew that a man may travel through the whole country with a constant suite of recommendations from one hospitable house to another The substance of the story is this a gentleman of the neighbourhood of Mahuntleth a little town in the extreme West angle of Montgomeryshire and which I described to you in one of my letters introduced himself politely to the company and hearing they travelled to satisfy their curiosity civilly offered to gratify it They asked him if there was a good house at the next stage He answered there were many Mr Lloyd's Mr Powell's Mr Edward's cThey still required which was the best house He replied they were all very good To make him explicit they persisted in asking him whether either of them was as comfortable and proper as that in which they were conversing meaning the village innSir said he with a peevish surprize should you take this house for a gentleman's They quickly explained themselves and begged his pardon  It would be unjust in me to omit telling you that the Welch are not only lovers of hospitality in themselves but sincere admirers of it in others and if a kindness has once been shewn them they never lose the impression of it One instance out of many I will recount In the vicinity of Caernarvon is one of the seats of my Lord Newborough Passing this one miserably cold day when the snows were frozen on the mountains I could not help exclaiming in the hearing of the honest Welchman who was at that time my guide across the countryWould to heaven that house were a public one Ah Sir said my guide with a sigh and crack of his whip it  was  one in former days that is to say it was a house for the good of the public as every body who wanted entertainment either for man or beast was welcome O there was rare doings at NewboroughHall when my Lord God bless him was at home he is abroad now and has been the more is the pity both for rich and poor many years but we expect him back soon which will make such a joy in Wales as has scarce been known since that old mountain meaning Snowden which is visible from the house was no bigger than a molehill You must know Sir I am William Jones continued this grateful fellow I am one of his  Lordship's tenantsthat little farm on the other side is rented by me where if your honour pleases I will shew you that I have not lived so many years under so good and generous a master without benefitting by the example and though I cannot set out my table like my Lord Newborough my old dame will give you a clean cloth some new laid eggs a curious slice or two of bacon and as brave a mug of ale or tankard of cyder with a dash of brandy as ever was drawn and we will drink the health and speedy return of my master to old WalesGod knows I will drink itjust as I wish itwith all my life and soul  He went on to assure me that as the day of Lord N's departure from this country was the most miserable so would his return be the most blessed to his servants tenants friends and all descriptions of peoplethat for his part he felt it a comfort to get his bread on the ground that belonged to so good a master and even to walk upon his land and that he never passed by the deserted mansionhouse without thinking of the obligations which he and a thousand others had received from the generous owner  He then proceeded to justify by instances of goodness this exalted character in the  course of his developing which he discovered a most excellent heart and not uncultured head belonging to himself but displayed so many marks of an enlarged benevolence in his master that before he had half finished his eulogy my affections warmed towards the noble proprietor of NewboroughHall and I could not but join the regrets of honest Will Jones that he was absent  These little roadadventures which are so frequently rising out of surrounding objects I must once more remark are amongst the richest gratifications that can happen to a traveller of my taste and temper They are indeed a source of almost daily pleasure and exercise of the social principle they freshen as it were one's whole heart and so occupy the best part of our feelings that if the roads are bad and the weather severe we perceive all ruggednesses and rigours smoothe off and if the way is without difficulty and the weather fine and the country through which we pass beautiful the whole is rendered more delicious by a little regaling casualty of this sort December has not often presented a more bitter day than that on which I received a delineation of Lord N from William Jones but some of the traits created a kind of summer  in my bosom and the rest of the journey to Caernarvon was the happier for it 'Tis even now sweet to remembrance and is registered amongst the riches of my sheaf  There is a great deal of  character  in this country and much of that original wit humour and oddity amongst the lower ranks which the late Henry Fielding so much delighted to describe Out of abundance I shall glean only two specimens each of which have something so dramatic that were I about to write a comedy I should be strongly tempted to hitch them into the scene and as I met with them both in the same day their portraits shall be drawn in the same letter  As there is a lady in the case she claims my first attention I beg therefore to introduce the widow Bowyer to you Suppose your Gleaning correspondent taking his afternoon tea at a little public house betwixt WelchPool and Shrewsbury and the widow my landlady thus officiously shewing herself off by way of recommending herself and her house Would you have the idea of the speaker before youI magination must body forth a neat little old woman of the true Welch architecture and dressed in the fashion of her countrya blue  Yorkin black broad brim beaver scarlet petticoat and apron of black shining stuff dropping a deep but rapid curtsey at every sentence"I hope you find your tea good Sir I always have the best of tea Sir  curtsey  Perhaps your honour's goodness would like a slice of cheese and hung beef  curtseyboth at the bread and cheese  I am notorious for them Sir  curtsey  I am a widow woman at your service Sir  curtsey  buried my husband  curtsey  about six weeks ago  curtsey  an ailing man Sir  curtsey  always weak and  wankly    curtsey  Could do nothing for many years Sir  curtsey  Palsy your honour  curtsey  cost me many a bright pound  curtsey  but 'tis always something for a woman to have a husband in the house  curtsey  Servants think nothing of a lone woman  curtsey  They do just as they please with them your honour knows  curtsey  "  Ah poor David continued she after a short pause seeing me disposed to hear but not to answer"Ah poor dear David he used to sit Sir  curtsey  in that very armchair Sir  curtsey  where your honour sits now and though I had to lead him up stairs and downput him to bed and take him uppoor soul helpless as an infantstill  I liked to be doing for himDavy I used to sayDavyyou'll never go on your legs again I fearyou'll never be the man you have been"  By way of parenthesis let me hook in the information that although I do not continue to insert the curtseys it is to be noted that the good widow went as regularly on with her reverences as with her story and that every dash you meet with is substituted to prevent interruption for a curtsey the long dash being expressive of an obeisance nine deep the short one of the little drop or bob minor  "We were notorious for being happy Sir and our house Sirthough thatched Sir is notorious all over the country Sirand if your honour should be provoked to stay the night Siryou shall have as good a bed as ever was laid onpoor David died on it Sir we are notorious for our bedsme and mine have lived here hundreds of years the finest air in the worldkill all our own meatcut all our own garden stuffgrow all our own wheatmake all our own bread brew all our own beerIn short do every thing for ourselves without being beholden to  any bodyThus your honour sees we are the most notorious people on the road"  The whole of the foregoing selfdescription passed without the smallest encouragement or reply my landlady standing all the while curtseying nodding crying and laughing for I should have observed to you that at every drop of her knees she gave a nod of her head and that whenever she mentioned David's infirmities she made up her face and voice into a most pitymoving whine which gave way however to a more pleasant twist of her odd little countenance and tones when she spake of the notoriousness of her house  My tea and her talk ended together when I told her that I was thoroughly convinced she had not obtained a notorious character without reason but that I found her so entertaining that as the evening was too far advanced to think of pursuing my journey towards Shrewsbury I would avail myself of the many good things for which her house is notorious on condition that she would favour me with as much of her company as possible and put me into any bed but that which poor David had  so lately died uponthe reflection of which circumstance would prevent my taking any repose  I gave it this turn to save the good widow's feelings and I ventured to invite her because I imagined her house affairs would draw her nods and curtseys to several other travellers who now came to pass the night Unluckily however she resolved to compliment me with her dead David's bed and though I could have wished it put upon a longer quarantine it was impossible for she assured me nod and curtsey as usual that not only gentrybut nobilitynot only 'squiresbut barrownights not only barrownightsbut lords not only lordsbut dukes here a nod that threw her head into her bosom and a curtsey that almost overset herand that even the Princeof the Principality  nod    nod    nod  the Prince of Wales himself  curtsey    curtsey    curtsey  might lie in that bed  Had the corpse of David been stretched still upon the bed you see I must have taken part of it I therefore yielded and the good widowwoman went nodding and curtseying  through the rest of the evening in perfect goodhumour Her manner must lose much in narration but I am convinced had it been dramatised and shaped to the talents of one of our comedians it would have set at least the galleries and perhaps the whole house in a roar  Notwithstanding this none of her other customers then in the inn seemed to be struck with what had so much diverted me one bid her do more and talk lessanother said he supposed she looked on her conversation as part of the entertainment and would charge it in the billif so he must decline any more of it The author of this observation was a wag who perhaps thought he was also a wit a third could not help wishing she had as good talents for silence as making a noise An hundred others might have entered and departed without being a whit more amused but as I am convinced the lover of character would not have passed my widowwoman without a note of remark I cannot but believe you and your friends will excuse nay thank me for making her a little more  notorious  One man only of the company was wholly silent and he had the best reason for it  namely an intoxication that wholly deprived him of the powers of speech two of the others just mentioned were his associates who had been to HaverfordWest on foot to save as much as possible of that money which they had appropriated to the release of their friend the drunken man who had been two years a prisoner for debt in the jail of the abovenamed town and they were all three natives of Wales working under the same master at Shrewsbury  As our widow woman's general sitting room usually served her like the merry cobler's in the ballad "for parlour for kitchen and hall" there being no fireplaces in the other apartments above or below we all were of the same mess while we were partaking of which the late prisoner excepted who was as incapable of eating as conversing one of the travellers he who had his fears that my landlady would make him pay for her eloquencethus opened upon me  "You must know Sir" says he addressing himself to me as familiarly as if we had been old acquaintance "the poor fellow who is now snoring in the chimney corner is Davy Morgan as honest a little man as any in  Wales and put into durance vile for another man's debt but we have worked him out and in a few days we shall be able to shew him to all friends round the wrekin in the meantime poor Davy is gone tipsy with the thought of it but you must not think the worse of him for that I hope his getting  into  jail and  out  of it once in his life and being a little  bicksius doxius  upon it once in his life I say will not make you think the worse of him Come little drunken Davy here is your health my boy as you can't drink I'll drink for you any thing to serve a friend sleeping or waking so here's to you in a bumper that holds both our portions my little sleeping Taffy  This bumper was emptied and filled with such rapidity that if there is any truth in a head full of liquor the account which was now given by both the comrades at supper of the snoring Davy Morgan did credit to the hearts of all the three I gathered from the torrents of information now poured out much faster than even the ale that Davy Morgan had been bound for a friend whose treachery had plunged him not only in a prison but in the ruin consequent on the loss of his time which used to be industriously employedthat his companions had been in the habits of friendship  labour and diversion with him many years that by his imprisonment they were deprived at once of their playmate and fellowworkman and that therefore they had a meeting one day to see what could be done between them towards getting their friend out of custody The result of their conference was a generous but secret treaty to use every means in their power to obtain his liberty but the sum for which he was confined exceeding abundantly their finances for they were all but journeymen weavers serving under the same master they made an attempt on the mercy of the creditor in the hope of such a compromise as they might be able to advance representing to him that the misfortune of the prisoner was brought upon him wholly by an act of goodnature and on the faith of the man who had betrayed him and that therefore in effect he was punished not only for the vice of another but for his own virtue  This appeal however failed and at a second consultation still held without the knowledge of the captive Davy they entered into a solemn compact to put by onethird of their weekly wages till a sum equal to the poor man's enlargement should be accumulated "We were both brotherbachelors Sir said one  of them and so could do this without pinching any body but ourselvesWill Griffith there indeed was to be married when he could afford a set of linen a wedding dinner and a weaving loom and had got a few good pounds snug in the box which his intended gave him as a token but the generoushearted girl who is an honour to her country"  "She is a Welch girl" Sir exclaimed Mr Griffith "and here's her health with all my soul"  "I say Sir" resumed the other traveller "that this brave wench on hearing the story of poor Davy and the plan to relieve him insisted on her not being the hindrance but the promoter of his liberty declaring that she was ready to contribute an equal share of her little savings towards effecting that good work and that by way of encouragement to her lover Griffith she would give him the disposal of her hand as soon after Davy could attend at the wedding as he thought proper to demand it"  "Till the moment after she said this Sir" said Griffith in rapture "I did not think it  had been possible to love her more dearly here's another bumper to her"  "To make short of the story" continued the other "to work we went aye and worked double tides for double pay and Kitty Lewis who worked too kept the box Every Saturday night we put in our savings and counted at the end of every quarter Not a syllable of this to Davy though we took care in the mean time he should not want for while the grass grows you know SirWell thus we went merrily onno matter how longtill we had enough then watching for the Passion week when there is no work done you know off we set from Old Salop to Haverford where poor Davy was taken as he was trying to get over to Ireland and was shut up Griffith and I who were born in the country knew every inch of the ground and to save money for better uses than throwing it away upon horseflesh we footed up after the fashion of our country carrying our shoes in one pocket and stockings in another When we got to the White Hart which is a very good inn directly opposite to the prison we did not stay to refresh till we had paid a visit to Morgan Our hearts were at our lips as we crossed over the way to him The poor fellow was sucking in  the fresh air through the grating which being on the ground floor we could see and speak to one another I thought Davy would have leaped through his bars to get at us though he looked pale as death and his beard was grown like one of your Hermits He threw out both his hands which we took hold of and told him they were cold as clay but my heart is as warm and as much your's as ever my boys said he in a terrible feeble voice and if I remain here for the rest of my life as I suppose I shall I will fall down night and day on my dirty straw to bless Providence that it has sent me the only two men I love in the whole world"  "Don't tell me Davy said Griffithyou remember Will these were your wordsdon't tell me of staying here the rest of your life we do not intend you shall remain here another day if we can help it not another hour We come with a strong box my little Davy that shall change your dirty straw into clean feathers and those damn'd ugly looking bars into a warm glass window but this is wasting timewhere's the gaolerlet us do our business first and talk afterwards"  Hereupon Griffith went in search of the keeper and I explained matters to Davy who  was in a surprise past speaking only he cried like a child and sometimes laughed again like a madman though when he came to himself he said he was ashamed to distress us and such nonsense to which I only answered never mind when we get our old fellowworkman amongst us again we will soon weave it up I warrant you and to tell you the truth Davy said I we have both had a fore loss of the songs you used to sing at the loom and neither of us can do any longer without you  Presently Sir Will Griffiths returned with the gaoler whom though he seemed a glum gruff growling looking fellow he had contrived to make smile as if he was half as goodhumoured a fellow as Will himself  "Aye money works miracles you know Sirexclaimed Will who thus ended the storyA bribe out of my Kitty's amberbox made the keeper of our poor Davy hasten to his release with almost as much glee as myself and as soon as the law charges which were somehow as heavy as the debt though nothing appeared to be said or done but clapping the poor fellow in prison and leaving him thereAs soon as these were fettled I say we took the bird out of his cage and  carried him in triumph to the White Hart where we passed one of the merriest evenings of our lives We have kept it up ever since as poor Davy's legs had been of no use to him for so long a time they refused to do much for him even now that they were untied as one may say so we got him into the stages as far as they went our way and when we were obliged to cross the country we put him upon a horse and at last after a jovial journey here we are at the widow Bowyer's thank God within half a dozen miles of Shrewsbury and Kitty Lewis That being the case we will if you please Sir have one more bottle to the health and happiness of all parties the amberbox holds out still and here it is at the service of any honest fellow that wants it though we never saw him before in our lives and should never see him again As to Kitty if she takes me without a shilling she takes me for myself unless we are both sick at the same time we can never be in need of bread because the hands of either can earn it and as to loom and linen they may be waited for and what the wedding dinner may want in fineries it shall make up in good plain fare and good appetite"  Will Griffiths having finished his speech kissed the amberbox with great devotion  swore it should not be long ere his labours filled it again and then shook me heartily by the hand observing that he could fee I liked the history he had been recounting as it had made me shed tears more than once in the telling and whenever I am touched to the heart with any thing said he I always cry  Davy Morgan waked and was all the better for his nap His comrades greeted his return to life as one of them called it with three cheers three bumpers of the notorious widow's ale and three such flaps on the back that he must have been actually dead not to have shook off all remains of slumber And now he had one advantage over his friends who had sacrificed to Liberty in so many "potations pottle deep "that they literally fell martyrs on the floor to their affections and the excellent homebrew'd of the widow who exhibited in the course of the tale many instances of a good heart by dropping a very low curtsey at every mark of the generality of the young weavers giving them a grateful nod at the same rime and declaring that if the widow's mite would be accepted by Davy Morgan the amberbox should not be forgotten  I really regret that Davy's pleasant compeers were now rendered so incapable as to require the supports of the good widow my own and even those of Davy himself to conduct them to bed Davy on his part was quite renewed and understanding from Mrs Bowyer that I had heard his story soon justisied his departed friends' eulogium of being a very pleasant grateful and goodhumoured as well as ingenious fellows  Presently the widow reminding us it was midnight I intreated to drink a glass of good wishes to the company as well sleeping as awake and then promised to retire One more tankard was therefore drawn but it was so relishing to Davy that he took it nearly off at a draught not only from love of the liquor but of his friends A second tankard was therefore brought but unluckily the hearty visit paid to the other came too suddenly on Davy's recovery from the former libations and his sober senses began to relapse The widow began to wink in her wicker chairthat line you may think has called in  "apt alliteration's artful aid"  but I assure you it was accidentalthe widow fell asleepDavy held the tankard in his  hand and without attending to a third or fourth person being in the roomprobably without knowing there was any body but himself present indulged and displayed himself in a soliloquy which if you will please to advert to time place and foregone circumstances may divert you I stop you from it only while I assert that  "I shall nought extenuate  "Nor set down ought in frolic"  A whole year's conversation could not to my mind better have pourtrayed the man  Now Davy Morgan is the time to shew thyself a great fool or a sensible little fellow Twice today haft thou been out of thy wits for joy and art but just come into them again enough to be sorry for it Beware the third time The ale is certainly goodthere's no denying itHere he lifted the tankard almost to his lips I could drink every drop of it with the greatest pleasureIt is but lifting the tankard half an inch higher opening my mouth a little widerin this mannerand if would be gone past recovery as King or Prince Denmark says  "To drink or not to drinkthat is the question  "Whether 'tis better for thee Davy thus to suffer  "The flings and arrows of outrageous thirst  "Or by thus plunging in a sea of ale  "Tippling to end itto drink and sleep  "No more and by that sleep to end  "The headache and the thousand natural shocks  "That tippling's heir to'tis a consummation  "Devoutly to be wish'dto drink and sleep  "Perchance be drunk againah there's the rub"  No damn it Davy don't make a beast of thyself any more today there's a good little fellow Thou art at present merry and wife Keep so my lad for the honour of Wales and for the sake of the good fortune that has dragged thee out of thy hole into the land of freedomDown tempter down"  Here he lowered the tankard but with such haste that he spilt part of its contents on his chin the sweet and savory smell of which so quickened appetite as Milton said of Eve when the grand tempter presented the forbidden fruit that poor Davy Morgan felt the original sin was entailed on him He again held the tankard up to his lips and could not but taste In that perilous instant he exclaimedDavy why don't you pull it away with all your mighthere he began to sip why don't you saySatan in the shape of a tankard of beer avaunthere he spoke with his head in the mug why don't you dash it to the groundhave you no honourno resolutionno philosophyno consideration no gratitude a great gulp between each of  these questions Fie upon youwhen a tankard is before youyou have no more strength thoughtideanornornorgulps continuednorany thing of that kindthan thanthangulps an infant  At this moment a lamentable cry was heard at the door accompanied by a loud rapping On opening it a poor creature appeared halffamished with cold it was the postboy betwixt Pool and Shrewsbury who being seized with the cramp in his stomach came to get a dram He had scarce time to describe the nature of his complaint before Davy Morgan applied a remedy by thrusting the poker which happened to be redhot into the tankard and then pouring the ale thus heated down the shivering man's throatexecrating himself all the time as a prodigal who had been wantonly wafting that which might now have been so much better disposed ofSee you rascal said he to himself what comes of your gugglingyou deserve to be lent back again to prison you do  The poor postboy soon felt himself renovated for the widow added a gill of her notorious brandy to Davy's burned ale after which he again mounted his horse saying he should soon fetch up lost time and honed God would  always bless those who he swore had saved his life  Davy Morgan however kept abusing himself for some time after but I contrived to pacify him by assuring him if he could parody Hamlet's celebrated speech so pleasantly I should think he deserved to get tipsy as often as he chose though it were to be with Nectar or Tokay Begging therefore he would forgive himself this time we all went to rest  The morning brought us all once more together and our breakfast for I was now one of the party was a very sober one In the middle of it there happened an incident which so accumulated the interests of the little drama that it added another notoriety to the house of the courteous widow This was the entrance of a very handsome young woman in a blue riding habit and straw bonnet bound tight with a peagreen ribbon which was fastened gypsey fashion and displayed such parts of a pretty countenance as made the spectator desirous to fee the whole Such a blush as has a thousand rimes ten thousand been seen and felt by lovers but never justly described even by them for who can paint like Nature One of these indescribable graces of that  "Eloquent blood  "Which so distinctly wrought  "That you might almost say her body thought"  suffused itself over her fine and by no means inelegant countenance at the fight of the man of her heart seated at table with the chosen friend towards whose ransom from captivity she had herself so generously contributed This young person was in the service of an old lady of fortune who was blind a misfortune which this attendant who you perceive was no other than Kitty Lewis greatly mitigated for being herself the daughter of a Montgomeryshire farmer of some credit and a girl of no mean talents besides the culture of a good education she was well calculated to entertain those who could not entertain themselves and was therefore very justly considered by her lady rather as a friend than servant  The moment that Davy Morgan's enlargement was effected Will Griffith wrote her word of it and mentioned the time at which he should regain Shrewsbury but accidents on the road detaining him Kitty then for the first time made her Lady confidential She declined doing so till the object of her lover's journey was attained willing that the honour of it should not be shared with any but the trio  that projected it The old lady however was as Kitty afterwards told me touched even to tears nor did she suffer those dews of pity to melt away or dry up without effect  Kitty had heard from the Pool postboy with whom she was acquainted that his life had been lost but for the humanity of a merry gentleman whose name he understood was David Morgan then at the widow Bowyer's from which information she drew the natural inference that her lover had got so far on his journey with his generous companion and liberated friend but that stopping so near the place of their destination might proceed from some little difficulty that money might remove This latter idea was suggested by the good old Lady who was now in the secret of the amber travelling box and who insisted that Kitty should be herself the bearer of a reenforcement but take care to present her bountymoney in a way that should not spoil the plot by an appearance of a fourth person's coming into it desiring at the same time that the party might immediately on their arrival at Shrewsbury repair to her house and that the adventure should not want a finish she permitted Kitty to make the excursion in a post chaise  Kitty was now seated by her lover's fide but was far too happy with her errand and with the view of the objects of it to partake of our breakfast neither did Will Griffith seem to take any food but that which love and friendship provided for his honest and affectionate heart The bill was soon demanded by Kitty Lewis when the widow declared it was paid "It is paid" quoth the good woman "by the merriest night and happiest morning I have ever hadI will take no moneyYesterday and today shall be notorious What you have had you are welcome toand a thousand thanksintothe bargainThese thousand thanks were expressed by almost as many nods and curtseys You need not take out your amber box Mr Griffithnor you your purse Miss Kitty what's jour nameI am notorious for telling the truth and what I say I sayso God be with you  nod and curtsey  and send you health and wealth and grace to do welland pray none of you pass the King's Head without callingI can do a good turn as well as anotherservantyour servantfare ye wellgood byeI wish ye all a good day and a pleasant ride to Shrewsburyand next marketday mayhap you may see me"  During this speech she was nodding and curtseying off the companyhelping them to hats sticks packages and hurrying them out of her house to prevent them insisting on the payment of the bill which Kitty fettled in another room whither she and the generous widow went to confer The young woman was diffident about entering the postchaise and Davy Morgan who had cried for joy almost the whole time of breakfast was apprehensive that the proud Salopians would laugh him to scorn to go from a jail into a carriage but Kitty gave it as her opinion that their refusal to profit by her Lady's goodness would be an affront never to be forgiven observing that as to the scorners  they  must have little claim to attention who did not feel that an honest man who had been put into prison for sacrifiring himself to his friend was not entitled to go home in the mod honourable manner and that for her part she thought such a man had better claim to a triumphal entry than Julius Caesar Alexander the Great or any other illustrious butcher of antiquity in as far as a friend to mankind is more deserving of honourable distinctions than an enemy  This adjusted the difficulty and after shaking hands all round the four friends set off for  Shrewsbury where they patted the day in high festivity under the auspices of the good old Lady who declared that although Providence had denied her the pleasure of beholding such happiness it had not taken away the power of feeling it to the bottom of her heart  I stayed no longer after them than while I congratulated myself and the courteous widow on the little adventure which had passed at her inn which I assured her would render it notorious to me for ever and that I would make the circuit of Wales in much harder weather than it then was to obtain such another night and morning You who are so versed in the nooks corners and byeplaces of my character will not doubt my using a direction I had obtained from the young weavers to pay them my respects at home I found them all assembled at the house of Will Griffith who told me with rapture too great to help it overflowing at his eyes that Kitty's Lady had insisted on his not waiting for the happy day while his labour should regain a sum equal to what his friendship had so properly disposed but that she would herself advance sufficient to make them happy immediately on condition that Kitty was to continue her situation and Will himself to accept  an apartment in her house declaring that so many years attention to a poor old blind woman who could not even move from one room to another without the aid of that worthy girl demanded alt the kindness she could shew her observing moreover that Griffith had in his late journey shewn himself so deserving of her that she was resolved on the satisfaction of knowing they were united before she died and that she was in some measure the means of bringing them together  Fortunately my dear friend my engagements made me residentiary in Shrewsbury a sufficient time to witness this pleasant event but I truly believe that had no other point detained me that one would not have suffered me to depart till I had attested the felicity of William and Kitty  It must nevertheless be confessed that were I in these Gleanings addressing only that part of your disposition which fits you to "shine in courts" and grace a drawingroom it would have been sinning past forgiveness to carry you into a common alehouse and instead of leaving it after a little refreshment detaining you there all night in low company but when I look on myself as making an  appeal to that part of your character which bids your beating heart exult in the happiness of your humblest fellowcreatures amongst whom is often found by those who are not too lofty minded to look for them in lowly dwellings those feelings of which the most noble born might be proud I have no supercilious taunt to fear but the most ingenuous thanks to expect for thus flopping by the way whenever an honest heart is to be pourtrayed whether it is the property of a prince or peasant Certain I am that your affections have long since dropt your tributary guinea into the amber box with a prayer that it may never be empty that the notorious widow has in your grateful fancy received your nods of response and approbation that poor Davy Morgan's tankard has been twice filled with good wishes for the comforting draught he gave the halfperished postboy that Will Griffith and his friend have received your homage for their adventure at the grate of Davy's prison that even the blind old Lady has had your blessing and that the young couple will be long remembered by your sympathising heart Adventures like these my friend are unimportant only to those magnificent triflers who think they are wife when they are only vain and as much of human comfort proceeds from  humble circumstances we may justly conclude with the poet in those enchanting lines I have so often read to you and which are the more appreciated inasmuch as I loved the author heard them recited by his own lips a very few weeks before I lost him for ever and know how truly he felt what with such exquisite beauty he has described for Goldsmith was one of the very few poets of nature who wrote only from his fensations and did not sacrifice the plain honesty of genuine feelings to decorate his rhimes  "Yes let the rich deride the proud disdain  "These simple blessings of the lowly train  "To us more dear congenial to the heart  "One native charm than all the gloss of art  "Spontaneous joys where nature has the play  "The soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway  "Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind  "Unenvied unmolested unconsin'd"  With what energy and enthusiasm did the bard though by no means a graceful reader repeat the four last verses and on the evening I heard them delivered he threw down the manuscript on his writing table in his abrupt way saying "in troth this is all as true as if it was in prose" and as I have said before and shall continue to say to the end of my life  "These little things are great to little men"  Are not you of his opinion my honoured correspondent I can answer for you in the fullest affirmative Long may you live to enjoy the joys of othersThey are your own for with you selflove and social are indeed the same  LETTER XIX TO THE SAME  YOU insist upon a copy of the lines which were annexed to the "TRIUMPH OF BENEVOLENCE"a triumph which you justly observe Jonas Hanway ought to share with John Howard  "Divide the glory and partake the gale"  This applies  well  to my subject and I remember another verse no less applicable to myself on the occasion  "Born for your use I live but to obey you"  And indeed it seems no less a point of inclination than of justice to attempt preventing the fate which commonly attends fugitive poems when published singly for like the  So says Lord Bolinbroke  sybyl's leaves they are scattered about with  the winds and tides of occurrence and with no disparagement to my verses be it spoken since 'tis the destiny of others which the loftiest muse might be proud to own they are as frequently found at the bottom of one's trunk as in one's library and often what we in vain offer money for to our bookseller we get of our pastrycook for nothing  The little monumental tribute offered to Hanway indeed might perhaps escape this annihilation by the care which love of the man may have taken of it in the private cabinets of friendship and I believe it is to be found in several of the periodical and other public collections of the year in which it appeared but I own I feel a sentiment too tender for vanity that  it  like the poem it follows should stand a chance to "travel down the stream of time" in a correspondence with thee  "My guide philosopher and friend"  And so without more ado I here subjoin the  STANZAS SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JONAS HANWAY ESQ  AND thou bled Hanway long thy country's prayer  Exulting now in kindred worlds above  Coheir of Howard deign the muse to hear  Tho' angels greet thee with a brother's love  Far tho' remov'd from this diminish'd earth  A crown of glory beaming on thy brow  The God who fix'd it there to note thy worth  Bids the rapt lyre with all thy spirit glow  And ah behold what grateful myriads come  While tears of extacy and anguish flow  Their blended incense pouring on thy tomb  To mark an empire's joy an empire's love  Close to thy Howard O congenial shade  On the pure column shall thy bust be plac'd  Though deep in every bosom is pourtray'd  Those holy records time shall ne'er erase  The generous plan that public virtue draws  The fair design that charity imparts  The genius kindling in religion's cause  Cherish their champion in our faithful hearts  At Hanway's bust the Magdalen shall kneel  A chasten'd votary of compassion's dome  The Magdalen House    With pious awe the holiest ardours feel  And bless the founder of her peaceful home  And O Philanthropy thy heavenrais'd fane  Foundling Hospital    Shall oft avow the good man's zeal divine  When bounty leads a poor and orphan train  To clasp their little arms round Hanway's shrine  Transcendent energies of grace sublime  Whose magic goodness work'd with double power  Cradled the outcast babe who knew not crime  And bade the sinner turn and blush no more  All full of honours as of years farewell  Thus o'er thy ashes shall Britannia sigh  Each age each sex thy excellence shall tell  Which taught the young to live the old to die  LETTER XX TO THE SAME  YOU thank me for my poetry without being aware into what a scrape your acknowledgments have led you The grant of one request paves the way for fresh application I have a resistless desire to send you more effusions of the muse and so far from being of the general opinion that a little of verse should be relieved by a great deal of prose I think the mind is never so well disposed to receive poetic impression or rather to feel impression continued as when it has been touched and warmed already by the subjects worthy of the lyre or if the emotion already excited should be found too solemn the gayer muse may be permitted to step in and soften but not destroy the pathos For these reasons I have chosen this letter for the insertion of some spontaneous lines which have not yet met your eyes or those of the public You have long since I trust agreed to accept my correspondence as a literary cabinet in which I am permitted to place for  your amusement and information whatever I can find worthy of preservation peradventure I may sometimes send you articles which you may deem neither proper objects of curiosity or care in which case I must appeal from the severity of your judgment to the lenity of your candour What I have now to give indeed is I confess not a little out of time as you may one day know but has the advantage of being perfectly in place for it happened in this very country in this very town that I felt the emotions described in the following stanzas You will consider me in one of my soliloquy perambulations by the seaside and my mind strongly fastened on by many of those bitter reflections which baffled at intervals all the powers I invoked to dispel them Placing me in such a situation you will not deem the sensations I indulged for a few moments unnatural nor were they the less strong or sincere for being made as they were in verse Though prose has been deemed perhaps falsely the language of truth that divine power loses none of her charms by borrowing a dress from poesy  I  ON the brink of the beach as I silently roam'd  My sorrows I mark'd on the wavesoften'd sand  Loud blew the wild winds and the white billows foam'd  And threw the salt fleeces of surf on the strand  II  Fast flow'd in the tide yet regardless I stood  And felt the white billows advance to my feet  The sandmarks of sorrow were lost in the flood  And the spray of the storm on my bare bosom beat  III  In the story of woe not a thought could I trace  Not the wreck of a wordand I said to the sea  Ah if thus you the story of woe can efface  Your bounty might sure be extended to me  IV  If here I remain on thy billowbeat shore  No friend near at hand in false pity to save  My woes like their story would quickly be o'er  And both owe to thee foaming ocean a grave  V  The billow roll'd on when something  within  More strong than the ocean thus seem'd to reply  Man no murder shall do  e'en in sorrow 'tis sin  I felt the command and obey'd with a sigh  Ah my friend may none of the incidents to which sensibility is heir tempt  your  firm mind beyond its strength even for a moment but if it should as our souls no less than our bodies are very "fearfully and wonderfully made" may the sacred order mentioned in the concluding stanza of these seaside verses impress  you  also with an awful sense of their being amongst the words spoken by  GOD and give you energies to bear the miseries of lifeI cannot but take notice of the use of those great truths which it is the part of education to engrave on our memories while that register is most favorable to impression The moral sentiments which we receive in childhood "grow with our growth and strength" they are so many lessons for the government of the heart in which they are fixed every precept we are taught to treasure up in our memories in the  earliest  periods of our lives comes by degrees into practice and serves not only to assist us to subdue vice but to animate virtue till she feels  proud of  her difficulties And hence I am seriously led to believe that we derive more real good real virtue and real wisdom from that little system of morals which we gather from the first books that are put into our hands after we lay aside our hornbooks and primers than from all our elaborate studies afterwards and I am persuaded more true heroes statesmen and which is far better than either honest men have been formed by Aesop Phaedrus Gay and Robinson Crusoe and by the histories which take only half a day in reading than were ever modelled by those histories which demand the study of half a life and it has long been a doubt with me whether  Jack the Giant Killer has not made more courageous officers and better generals I am sure he has less mischievous ones than Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great  For myself I confess I am indebted to the poets whose maxims were imprinted on my insant mind for the heightening of every joy and meliorating every sorrow that has befallen me since and I particularly remember that some passages from Robinson Crusoe tended more effectually to settle my mind to the dispensations of Providence on the evening of the day in which I wrote the verses that accompany this letter than perhaps it would have been in the power of Seneca Socrates or any of the most renowned philosophers of ancient or modern days to afford me  In fine my friendif we expect pleasure we must make up our minds to pain They are twins and Dr Young is right  "Complain of gries complain thou art a man  "Our only lesson is to learn to suffer  "And he who knows not that was born for nothing"  LETTER XXI TO THE SAME  YOU may have perceived my dear friend that since I have been taking you out of Wales we have been gradually taking leave also of our observations on that principality in short I do not remember any other points which are  gleanable  With respect to the ancient and modern history of the country it is well known to you histories indeed of every country are so numerous that a reader is puzzled to make his election But the fault to be found with almost all biographical writings is not more their number than their bulk which is for the most part produced by extraneous matter not more necessary to the body politic than an excrescence to the body natural Historians indulge themselves in these superfluities from various motives amongst which national prejudice and the defire the necessity or the pride of becoming at once a great folio or quarto author are not the least  I have often thought that all the histories now extant with respect to the facts really necessary to describe the productions of art or nature or the progressive rise and fall of states or their sudden revolutions might be compressed without being crouded into at most the number of volumes allotted to the history of any particular country according to the modern fashion of writing  By way of example let us take that of England Would it not be better to give the facts in the strongest and shortest way offer the inferences in the same style and leave the reflections in a great measure to the reader It would at least be a decent compliment to his understanding and save him money If indeed it could be proved that the reflections made by the historian Mr A were decisive and would settle the reader's mind on the subject it would be mighty well but unluckily the historian Mr B comes upon you with seven or eight more volumes of reflections in which he flatly contradicts the historian Mr A and throws the reader in a strait betwixt two Now as no man tumbles into a difficulty without accepting any help that is offered him to get out of it the poor reader  seeks the aid of the historian Mr C who refutes the reasoning of the other two with so much good writing that after the like quantity of good reading the student wishes to fix his faith on this middle man in the hope of going safe and sure between the two other extremes  Unfortunately however some judicious friend or other recommends to him as a better guide than either of the three that admirable historian Mr D who with great force of language gives the lie direct to all that went before him and either awes or frightens his readers into a belief of him only And here perhaps he might fix his biographical creed but that another friend puts into his hand the excellent work of the historian Mr E in whom the spirit of contradiction is no less fulminating against the other betrayers of the truth By the greatest good fortune however he meets in the historian Mr F a strict conformity of opinion with Messrs A and B dissenting only in a few points He very naturally wishes therefore to come to a sort of compromise with these three historians by dividing his faith between them but alas while he is making up his mind to this he is told of a production superior to all that ever  went before or shall come aftereven the work of that delectable historian Mr G an author he is assured who carries the energies of conviction in every page and who does not merely distance his competitors in the biographical career but is to keep them out of the reader's sight for ever He sets "doggedly down" as Johnson calls it to this grand undertaking and reads it with an eagerness proportioned to his expectation of being made easy for life on the article of his historical faith he is fascinated with the style the characters and the picturesque embellishments and with a winter's hard reading gets to the end of the book but by no means to the end of his labours for in the course of the performance he finds so many reasons to disbelieve what he before credited and to credit what others taught him to disbelieve that confusion is confounded and Chaos is indeed come again What shall he do next Much study and many many authors have made him almost mad  But in this distracted state he finds relief only in trying to eject the mass of contrary opinions from his head and to try that science no less hard in literature than in love to  forget  He is reduced to the ridiculous necessity of making a  memorandum not to remember  Perhaps he now gives himself a summer's recess from reading histories but is taken by surprise in the winter to enrich which there is put forth in weekly numbers so compleat a history on an entire new plan and by a society of gentlemen amongst whom are those wellknown historians Messrs H I J K L M N O and several other illustrious personages of the Alphabet that as it is to be paid for imperceptibly and to answer the great end of fixing his historical belief on an immoveable basis he must needs become both purchaser and reader Amongst so many counsellors it is to be supposed there must be wisdom especially as most of them are marked out to the public by some honorary distinctions such as A M D D LL D F R S c c But before the numbers are half completed he makes a discovery not a little mortifying to a man who has been at such pains to get at the truth namely that this very gentlemanly association are airy nothings to whom the publisher has given a local habitation and a name to give plausibility to a catchpenny performance  And now for the first time he makes an approach towards comfort by feeling his indignation excited against the fabricators of these splendid nonentities  At length having tried all the historians from great  A  to  ampersand  he perceives there is no escaping from the puzzle but by selecting his own facts forming his own conclusions and putting a little trust in his own reason and judgment  For all which considerations I shall not pretend to point out to you another History of England and Wales I shall simply observe that old Carodoc's book obsolete as now it may be thought seems to me to have been the grand source from whence all succeeding biographers have drawn their most useful information  "Truth they say lies in a well"  Into this historical well of Carodoc authors have let down their empty buckets for more than a century and drawn them up full but though they have drank largely they have  seldom had the gratitude or honesty to confess to whom they were indebted  Thus my valuable friend we have travelled together irregularly indeed and without any settled directions but I trust not unpleasantly nor wholly unprofitably and for a considerable time over one of the most delightful countries in the universe In our little pour we have been diligent to add a sheaf to the copious harvest already carried home to the great storehouse of the British empire who ought to be proud of the bright and beautiful appendage which we have been  gleaning  We have picked up something for the head and for the heart  "Try'd what the open what the covert yields"  and I trust you would join my regrets in bidding Cambria adieu did you not also join me in the hope that we shall one day see the original of the picture whose principal features I have copied and see it together Meantime I cannot better take my leave of it than by confirming with the most grateful satisfaction the following just and summary account that the Welch are very hospitable and the people in general very obliging to strangers that they  are willing to tell every thing that belongs to their country ready to shew all that is worth seeing and to give you hearty invitations to refresh you by the way In a word they receive you well in their houses treat you very handsomely and leave you nothing to desire while you are their guest  Farewell then to this gentle country and farewell to you  LETTER XXII TO THE SAME  THE effect of contrast is universally confessed and its power could not be well called forth more impressively on the eye the heart and the imagination than by a rapid transition from the beautiful mountains of North and South Wales to the everlasting flats of Holland from the exquisite woodlands and vallies of Brecknock and the sublimities of Snowden and Plinlimmon to the uniform levels of land and water which so justly entitle the greater part of the territory of the Dutch to the epithet amphibious I write to you amidst prospects and places so very different from those I have recently left and described that it almost seems as if I was addressing you from a new world The pause however which has been allowed to my communications more than six months having elapsed since I last wrote will evince that I do not presume to give you new pictures of new people and new places till I have given time to finish the drawings and present them to you tolerable likenesses In a word  the stop that has happened in our correspondence may serve to shew that I hold my purpose of continuing to be a residentiary traveller here as well as elsewhere and that I design to glean the Continent in the same diligent and deliberate way that I have gleaned particular parts of our beautiful island  A French tourist gives his readers the following curious reason for not making any remarks upon Holland "I can give you" says he "very little that is new respecting a country which in truth has no resemblance to any other but of which a sufficient knowledge may be gained without having seen it at all for the little instruction it can supply"  Now this very circumstance of a country resembling no other is the most convincing one that could be given that it must afford the greatest novelty of observation and so far from a truth is it that he who has not seen or read of it can have a competent idea of it that I do not believe there is a country in the whole world that is less to be guessed at or that is more fertile of curious amusing or instructive remarks Much has certainly been said of it much remains to be said It  has yielded plentiful crops but it will still yield no scanty gleanings Remember this is said on the experience of half a year's residence in the Republic before I even begin to write down what I have seen felt or understood and during this space of time I have examined what others assert with no less zeal than industry and with exactly the view that led me to inspect all the publications respecting Wales namely to render my own the better the wiser and the more entertaining by their assistance whenever it could be called in to strengthen enrich or illustratea view which will guide and govern me to the end of my journeyings even though I should pursue them to the end of the earth  The ancient history of this country is liable to the complaint I brought against that of England being swelled from octavos to quartos from quartos to folios and running from five volumes to five and twenty per work Being firmly persuaded that the essence of all this may be consolidated in at  most  five and twenty pages I trust you will accept of what follows on the rise and progress of this singular country and its original inhabitants It will at least save you a great deal of unprofitable  reading and give you in a single morning or evening as much information as I have been able to collect from a month's study Nor will it I trust prove unamusing to one who attends so much as you do to the infancy of men and things  About a century then before the common aera the Cimbrians and Tutons suddenly expatriated themselves from the Chersonesus now known by the names of Jutland and the isles of Conan at present denominated Denmark A violent and unexpected inundation as it is said but more probably too excessive a population for their native country to support or perhaps an ambition to establish in another induced this singular emigration Be that as it may men women and children of all ages and descriptions bid an everlasting adieu to the places of their birth and like a torrent overflowing its banks they carried away with them almost every thing and every body in their path for divers other nations incited by their example and perhaps instigated also by similar motives joined them on the way and speedily associating entered into the spirit of this romantic expedition  Amongst the persons whom these rovers met with in their passage were the ancestors of the people in whose country I have now begun to make my historical Gleanings  The old Batavians were the more ready to enter themselves volunteers in this adventure as their own country ever more or less at the mercy of the mighty waters was at that particular moment invaded by an influx of the German ocean which threatened not only their goods and habitations but their lives The Roman history shews us the ravages which these wandering multitudes committed in Spain and in Gaul and how for a length of time they triumphed over all the generals which the imperial city sent to oppose them till that memorable epoch when Marius exterminated with fire and sword the innumerable swarms that covered the provinces  The countries from whence these selfbanished banditti came remained utterly depopulated nor was it till several ages after that another set of emigrants seized the same country and rose by degrees a comparatively happy and successful nation on the very ground where so many thousands of former adventurers  had perished the victims of their ambition The Cymbrian nation till that period appeared to be annihilated Tacitus informs us that in his time there remained only the memory of their enterprize  The Batavians inhabited the banks of the Adriana now called the Ader a river which runs between Hesse and the country of Waldec These people long harrassed by their avaricious and ambitious enemies the Cates resolved to explore a more peaceable situation The great isle of Rhine as it was then called and which as I have already observed had lost its inhabitants was the place to which these new adventurers directed their steps Encouraged and conducted by the chiefs of their religion they landed under favour of a prosperous voyage on that part of the island which had been deserted and satisfied with a country that had been forsaken by its original inhabitants they determined upon settlement The plan was attended with such success that although we find in subsequent ages various other people fixing there also these new colonists alone rendered the land they occupied famous and it was only these who gave it the name of Batavia  A short description of this island of Rhine as it was anciently called is necessary and the best I can glean for you is that it is a country detached from the Continent by the Rhine the right arm of the river still preserves its name and according to general opinion rolled its rapid waves into the bosom of the ocean from the place now called Katwick The left arm is denominated the Waahl whose streams presently join those of the Meuse which also finds its way to the sea by another vast opening Hence it appears that Batavia now the United Provinces extended about twentyseven leagues in length and seven in breadth Many respectable authors contend for a greater scope Some insist that the left arm of the river which lost itself at Katwick subdivided into several other branches which formed a variety of lakes the most considerable of which was called Flero and a cluster of smaller islands of which the most important was that of Schelling  It is certain then what was anciently called Batavia included a very great part of the provinces of Guelderland Holland and Utrecht At the same time it seems to be an opinion wholly unfounded that the Batavians were  long content with the circumscribed limits which was bounded by the left arm of the Rhine They passed into what was then called Belgic Gaul between the Meuse and the Waahl They soon possessed themselves of the whole of Guelderland and Holland and spread themselves over the delightful country now denominated the dutchy of Cleves There is reason to believe they carried their establishments even as far as Zealand at least so much of it as was then habitable and in short it is manifest that the people which the Romans called perhaps a little confusedly Batavians formed by far the greater part of the ancient inhabitants of the United States of Holland  The people called Freezelanders made their appearance on the stage about the same time and acted a no less important scene in the great drama of politics They possessed the provinces of Freezeland Overyssel and parts adjacent  You will join my exclamation about the progress of this extraordinary race of powers Originally a horde of miserable wanderers quitting one inhospitable soil for another chusing an apparently impracticable spot and attaching themselves to it as if proudly determined to make the barren ground and a world  under water fruitful even to abundance Is it scarcely to be credited these are the people who on a trembling quagmire founded a more noble city in despite as it were of nature herself than the imperial for who that has seen Amsterdam but must give it the preference to Petersburgh There is true sublimity in the idea of supporting one of the most magnificent cities in Europe on rafts of timber placed upon an enormous bog Matter of fact is compelled to borrow strength from imagination to believe such a miracle wrought by the toil industry and perseverance of human beings And indeed reason seems to struggle against her own conviction when she sanctions every word of the following apostrophe "How wonderful" says the author of it "that in a country without a stone or a pebble there should be stone edifices the most magnificent without forests or an oak tree two little woods excepted the Dutch navy should be the second in the world that without arable land they should supply half Europe with corn and with a tract of country scarcely larger than an English county they should raise men and money to make themselves of imporrtance in the eyes of the first power in Christendom"  How often my friend when I have seen the truth of these observations have I called to mind a most beautiful remark of the excellent Dr Johnson on the united effects of revolution industry and perseverance "The power of  persisting  is indeed astonishing since all the performances of human art at which we look with praise or wonder are instances of the resistless force of perseverance It is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid and that distant countries are united by canals If a man were to compare the first effect of a single stroke of the pickaxe or spade with the general design and last effect he would be overwhelmed by a sense of their disproportion yet these petty operations incessantly continued at last surmount the greatest difficulties and mountains are levelled and oceans bounded by the slender force of human beings"  The people we are considering strongly illustrate these sentiments more particularly where it is considered that their successors are almost the only race now in Europe who have preserved amidst all the convulsions of passion and of power their liberty and their country  The best manner in which I have ever known this honourable truth explained is to recollect that the state itself was founded on liberty  and religion that it was reared by industry and oeconomy and has flourished by its commerce and situation The bigotted maxims of Philip the Second the introduction of the inquisition and the erecting fourteen new bishopricks in the Low Countries the unrelenting rigour of Cardinal Granville and the succeeding cruelty of the Duke of Alva together with the council of twelve called the Council of Blood and the execution of Counts Egmont and Horn were the causes which drove the people to throw off the yoke and gave rise to the union of Utrecht  Persevering  valour joined to the political assistance of other powers has been the means of preserving their independence while the decline of the Venetian navy has made them the common carriers of Europe and the wars of Flanders and situation of Holland have conspired to render it what it now is The Dutch likewise by the success of their arms against the Portuguese in India and by their treaties with the natives in process of time drew the whole trade of India from Lisbon which was before the staple of the trade to the east  Holland moreover is most admirably situtated for the commerce of the Baltic which includes  Norway Denmark Sweden Russia Poland and the North coast of Germany while they send merchandise into the interior parts of the empire and Austrian Netherlands by those watery mines of wealth to them the Maes the Rhine and the ScheldThus you perceive the greatness and much of the vigour of this country has arisen from a wonderful concurrence of favourable circumstancesfrom a long course of timefrom the confluence of strangers driven either by persecution or invited by the credit of their governmentfrom the cheapness of carriage by medium of their canalsfrom the low interest of money and dearness of land which consequently turn specie into tradefrom particular traffic carried on at particular places each town valuing itself for some branch of trade as for instanceDelft for the Dutch porcelain Sardam for shipbuilding Rotterdam for the Scotch and English trade Amsterdam for that of the Straits Spain and the EastIndies and the whole province for the herring fishery They are also indebted much to their intense application to their navy to the vast nurseries for their sailors and to their oriental acquisitions Such are the circumstances that have  conspired to make this little Republic the admiration of the world  When I next write to you we will resume our sketches of the ancient inhabitants the founders and forefathers of this singular country particularly in their exercises customs dresses and habitations in all which we shall discover a much stronger resemblance to our own progenitors than all our good countrymen may be disposed to allow Assuredly my worthy compatriots ought to be the most grateful people to the Great Fountain of all good things of any upon the face of the earth for the stayathome part of them which is always the majority cannot be persuaded that he has imparted the light of his countenance or fed with his replenishing hand any of their fellowcreatures in a nearly equal degree The happy island they inhabit has alone they suppose enjoyed his favour and to tell them that there are in any other parts of the universe as bright a sky as generous a soil wholesome laws as beauteous prospects hearts as brave hands as ingenious or heads as wise would be considered as amongst those liberties which travellers like poets are allowed to take with truth  I must own the inflammable parts of my nature are apt to take fire when I hear my friend John Bull thus dress out for universal admiration and homage his idol Old England and applying a verse of Pope I cannot but ask  "Has God thou fool work'd solely for thy good  And I am convinced my friend amongst the best advantages of travel should be reckoned its enabling us to "vindicate the ways of God" by first discovering and then describing the  impartiality  of his beneficence not only as to his creatures but as to the climates appointed for their residence and thus proving that he is "an equal God the God of all"  LETTER XXIII TO THE SAME  YOU justly charge me with a digression in my last letter and at the same time honourably acquit me In giving you the history of the present flourishing state of the commerce and its causes I have a little anticipated that part of my information which should have been gleaned afterwards but the observations appeared apposite to the place where they are introduced and I think none of their effects can be lost by your being in possession of them a few pages sooner  Let us now take up the tangled thread of the early history of the Batavians Originally Germans they partook their customs manners and language frequently their names and commonly their interests They were as Yoric would say of them "of the first order of sizes" their limbs muscular their shoulders broad their eyes blue yet their countenances fierce better able to endure the rigours of cold than the languors of heat penury than  care the fatigues of pleasure in the chace and the pleasures of ambition or of plunder in the toils of war than the labours of agriculture and domestic oeconomy They could more easily support famine itself than the corrodings of sorrow from which indeed they were pretty secure while there was enough left on the face of the earth to sustain its inhabitants The old Batavians like the Arabs could never want what others could supply The spontaneous good which nature refused to bestow ready cut and dried to their hands in the country they had now made their own they sought and seized upon without any distinction of  meum  and  tuum  in another And indeed whatever could not be had without trouble at home they ravished abroad the law of might overcoming right being the only one they acknowledged and I fancy my friend this summary code was pretty universally adopted in all the countries of the globe till the savage of our own species or man in a state of nature and as the castle builder Rousseau calls it a state of equality was taught a very different lesson of jurisprudence Natural man and man  made  social no doubt are different sort of persons but with all the boasted refinements  civilizations  and  meliorations  of the latter what a savage he must still be to require so many thousand volumes acts of parliament statutes at little and at large to keep the still unsubdued part of his nature commonly honest Did ever the wildest courser of the woods did ever beast of prey require so much training trammelling muzzling chaining coaxing correcting wheedling spurning whipping goading and haltering And after all bound hand and foot and tongue and teeth as he is he continues to get loose from his keepers the lawyers and snap scratch and bite most furiously Is not this so self evident a truth that before one man dare trust another one friend enter into negociations of any kind with the denizen of his bosom though he may have been nourished with the same milk and been rocked in the same cradlemust not the aforesaid keepers double lock and bolt and bar and chain every door and crevice of the connexion they are about to form And how often does one or the other in despite of all this caution find a loop hole to creep out at Still more can the gentlest of gentle creatures delightful woman herself formed as she is by love and for love can even she who seems to wish or require only bonds of silk and fetters of roses thrown  about her by Cupid as if in sport alas and alas and alas a thousand times can this fair being with any safety trust or be trusted in settling that tender point which is to determine by an honourable union the weal or woe of her life till the wrecks of our original nature are tied together by contracts settlements provisos conditions c c lest any one of the "nice dependencies" of two espoused hands and hearts should be invaded broken A domesticated tyger whose nature it is expected may break out is less watched less dreaded and less manacled than a modern fine gentleman or but remember I am whispering thisa modern fine lady  You will have reason to accuse me of a second digression Forgive me I own these poor old Batavians are sadly interrupted but you are to consider a Gleaner is a sad wandering being and always stooping to see what he can pick up one ear of corn lying here another there it is impossible he can go strait forward you know and I once again warn you not to expect it Nor is it to be desired My sheaf which I mean to interweave and bind with flowers of all kinds and of all countries would want variety and my Gleanings only  fit for "Daws to peck at" I am ambitious to add sweetness to its strength You tell me in several of your letters that I have done so of course I continue the plan that has been honoured with your approbation and yet I cannot help now and then stopping to make an apology  Even the sports of the old Batavians partook of their aversion to labour Those games which flattered with the hope of being acquired with little difficulty and less attention were in conformity to their dispositional indolence which they sometimes suffered to put at hazard the only thing they truly valued their liberty They consumed their excess of leisure in feasts carousals and sleepa long trance of the latter being often necessary to prevent the effects of the other as what they usually began in good fellowship ended in bloodshed  How different I cannot but repeat from the race of the same men in progressive ages How different even from those who in the age immediately succeeding the first settlers became as in our own ancient history often the formidable enemies and often the powerful  auxiliaries of Rome And yet how widely removed from their hardy industrious indefatigable posterity the late and present possessors of all that proportion of the globe which appertains to the Dutch nation  In taking a comparative view of ancient and modern Holland we cannot but be struck with great astonishment at the contrast When the provinces were in their infancywhen a little colony of emigrating Batavians made their election of a part of the world often chosen and as often renounced as an impracticable soil the wants of nature were accommodated by nature herself with all the facility these her indolent children required They found the waters teeming with fish and the land covered with cattle no cities and few towns the ancient Germans regarding the first as large and the latter as so many small prisons The camp was at once their residence in peace and war and a field was luckily for their supine tempers covered with temporary habitations without much toil They could pitch an hundred tents in less time than they could construct one regular house and could moreover move them at will from one province to another while many preferred the bare ground  whose carpet was spread ready to receive them to any other dwellingplace living like the beasts they fed on as commoners of nature  "Their footstool earth their canopy the skies'"  Long after their primary settlement when there were about ten colonies within and without the island of the Rhine each colony cantoned in the impassable moors rather than be at the fatigue of moving farther Were it possible for their historian Tacitus to come from that "bourne whence no traveller returns" and take a survey of those provinces he wrote about in his lifetime and which I am now gleaning for my friendwere he to observe the then impassable morasses that extended their dreary waste from province to province and to survey the then usurping and useless waters which inundated the drooping the almost drowning country  n  w  converted into a noble republic embellished with some of the most magnificent towns in Europe thickly interspersed with beautiful villages  "The slow canal the yellowblessom'd vale  "The willowtufred bank the gliding fail  "The crouded mart the cultivated plain"  Were he my friend to have been the companion of my journey through Holland North and South and traversed with me the fine country of Gueldresof all which I shall write you in their placeand yet more were he to behold these very provinces inhabited by the descendants of those very Batavians who though endued with every power to suffer every extremity and to overcome it refused either to toil or spin now filled with swarming multitudes whose characteristic is persevering industry and who while they have brought every branch of commerce perhaps to its highest perfection have not been unmindful of the elegant arts he would scarcely be able to find a trace of  his  Batavians except in the unaltered feature of hereditary courage  In the dress of the ancient possessors of this country we find a resemblance to that of the ancient Britons Children of nature they depended on their common parent to furnish them as well with raiment as with food the skin of a beast fastened with a wooden peg or a pointed thorn was wrapped about them Their chiefs had by way of distinction a vest made of the same and so right that they  seemed as if cased in iron The women were discriminated only by the addition of a thin veil bordered with purple Most of them discovered from blissful ignorance of harm what the knowledge of the world in its polished state conceals from consciousness The arms neck and bosom were always displayed Their hair though naturally of an ardent brown was deepened by red ochre They formed their tresses into several large braids fastened at the top of the head with field flowers not unlike the present mode but they sometimes suffered the hair to flow in all the liberty and abundance of nature The men's beards were permitted to grow till they reached the waist but on the downfall of an illustrious enemy slain by their own hands they were cut short both before and behind  When they began to domesticate and could be prevailed on to prefer a fixed residence to a moving tent they built a local habitation wherever they found the clearest fountain the most shady thicket or most fruitful meadow but always on an eminence either natural or artificial to guard them from the inundations common to the country they had chosen They were of course long ignorant of the thousand  arts by which civil society is embellished and advanced Even when they began a little to civilize the care of providing for the necessaries of lifetheir  only  carewas left to the slaves the freed men or the women  Their education was suited to the simplicity of their pursuits Natural courage was taught as the first of virtues that ought to be cherished and a dextrous defence of the body from the attacks of an enemy as the best of arts Intrepidity in combat contempt of death and personal agility were the three grand points to be acquired Their constitutions so sluggish in times of peace took fire at the very thought of war They would traverse the deepest snows and plunge through the most turbulent rivers under arms without even breaking their ranks Their horses were neither swift nor strong and being accustomed always to run a tilt in the straight line without having the smallest idea of the military evolutions of so much importance in the modern art of war their principal force and dependence was of course in their infantry When they were arranged in regular order of battle they placed their wives and children in the rear and always certain groupes of both within  view as well to sustain and excite the valour of the combatants as to assist the wounded and also to animate the whole army by intermingled shouts cries and acclamations It was common to see wives mothers daughters and lovers rush amidst the thickest dangers of the bloody field carry off the dead succour the dying and suck the reeking wounds of an husband father lover or brother Actions of this kind are mentioned in our own history as great and glorious instances amongst individuals but in the first approaches to the importance of this little republic such heroic atchievements were common to the sex and hundreds of Boadicea's and Eleonora's were to be seen acting wonders in the same army nay it was a part of their office to pursue and overtake the fugitives make them return to the charge and either contribute to victory or encounter death  You may easily believe my friend the effect of such eye witnesses of glory and disgrace would be great you feel the strong and lively interest it must have produced on the minds both of the timid and the brave that it must have converted cowards into men men into heroes heroes into conquerors And you will  at the same time allow that we shall in vain look for equal enthusiasm equal prowess amongst those modern mercenaries who sell their very blood to an unknown master in whose service they engage with  his  enemies for daily bread Instead of taking the field like the bold Batavian at the command of the generous at least of the glowing passions instead of fighting an enemy and embracing a friend on the same heartfelt principle the hired soldier moves on mechanically to action without any other idea than to obey In this automaton state he is conducted by his master  pro tempore  to conquer or defeat  "Equal to both and arm'd for either field"  Of the former he shares not neither desires to share the glory nor of the other does he incur or feel any part of the infamy Few are the real scarce any the adequate reasons which justify the horrors of public war but the mercenary is left without the shadow of an apology It is not a necessary of his life because that might be sustained by converting the strength which is demanded of him in battle to the arts of peace his plunder is but a robbery licenced by the articles of war and the murder which he commits in action is a butchery  in cold blood Neither person nor property king nor country bid him unsheath the sword or fire the musket spring the mine or dig the trenches he is an inveterate bravo a common stabber to any man that bids up to his price that done his master has but to say"Look ye slavesthose are my enemies whom I have hired you to massacre kill as many of them as you can" On a similar compact in perhaps the next campaign he turns his arms against the side he before espoused and goes on in this manner letting himself out first to one leader then to another  In these reflections you see my opinion of mercenary troops I dare say it is your's for you are too much a woman of emotion to approve of a man's standing to be murdered or to murder with no better reason than that it is his trade and his bloody work is paid for War is at best an Hydra calamity Every man has some country some chief some relatives If he must take up arms let it be for these At any rate let him fight on something like a principle but the mercenary's very name points out his infamy Will you tell me a mercenary troop is often brave Would it were in a better cause Yet how I argue Were  your  life endangered my friend and were the danger to threaten it in a distant land farfar from your friendsfar from me I would become a mercenary myself and fight for an hundred different paymasters to reward the man who should save you Adieu  LETTER XXIV TO THE SAME  ON the article of marriage I have to inform you that the ancient Batavians considered it as infamous to connect themselves in that state before each party had reached the twentieth year The conduct of the courtship even to its final settlement was ever in the presence of the principals of the two families about to enter into the alliance This might make love very moral but surely not very entertaining In the nuptial offerings the bridegroom always took the lead They usually consisted of a yoke of oxen a warhorse caparisoned a sword a lance and a buckler  strange lovegifts you will think for a bridal present but these warlike symbols taught or were intended to teach the bride to elevate herself on every great occasion above the imputed weakness of her sex to partake the labours and dangers as well as laurels of her lord in war and in peace in life and in death Having thus armed the fair warrior the bride presented her offerings which resembled those of her husband whom she accout  ed for the field with equal gallantry that each might defend the other Very Gothic to be sure but perhaps after all nearly as good sensical as the modern preliminaries of toys and trinkets silks and sattins with which a modern British bride or even a modern Batavian lady of whom in due time is loaded  As the new married couple could easily procure subsistence in their flockherds and fruits of the earth and game of their forests for part of their territory was then well wooded besides their corncakes and a kind of beer which the Batavians in the most early times were wont to make from their grain there was little fear of wanting an healthy offspring which however numerous knew no other breast than that of their mother Then my  friend Refinement a very puny and puling babe and of a very delicate constitution was but just born and had not amongst other unnatural ideas suggested that of committing the pledges of our love to the bosom of a stranger  Their funerals partook the same simplicity The corpse of a distinguished person was burned upon a kind of pyre always with their arms a marriage gift and very often with the horse that had carried them to battle A verdant hillock a grassy eminence at once covered and marked the spot where their ashes were deposited The natural affections too were in their simplicityof course in their energy The women honoured the deceased with such tears as refinement seldom sheds and breathed over the grave with such sighs as fashion rarely heaves while the men mourned their dead by more silent sorrow and no less profound regret  In regard to religion the ancient Batavians and the ancient Briton had somewhat of similitude Through all the deep disguises of fable which in barbarous ages have always disfigured the truth one may discover among  the Germans as among the Celtes and the Gauls the idea of one God Supreme the principal and the preservation and the providence of all But in the most remote time we do not find these people had either temples or idols holding it equally presumptuous profane and absurd to attempt  representing  or  enclosing  the Deiry They rushed into the thickest forests in search of certain trees they considered to be sacred under whose shade they slew their victims and too frequently Druidlike mingled the streams of human blood with those of the animals they sacrificed It does not seem probable if we except the sun moon and fire that they had any of the divinities common to the Romans Their Woden was different from the Oden of the Scandinavians who at first considered this famous personage as a hero then worshiped him as a God Woden Oden and God were perhaps names synonimous to signify Deity  Nor had these people less veneration than our own forefathers for certain oracles and soothsayers These were consulted on all occasions of difficulty and danger and their answers were expected with trembling awe and heard with submissive reverence  As in the sweet country to which I have devoted most of our hitherto correspondence the ancient Hollanders also had their bards whose office it was to sing and celebrate the heroes of their country their romances transmitted with pious care to their posterity not only serve to perpetuate their own exploits but to incite in their descendants an equal emulation The prophetic poets were principally resorted to in the day of battle concerning which so minute was the superstition that the presage of good or bad of victory or defeat or the degrees of either depended on the different modulations with which these warlike songs were chanted the very moment preceding the encounter Like the Romans they took also a fortunate or inauspicious omen from the flight of birds or the neighing of horses which were fed in consecrated woods The issue of a single combat between one of their own soldiers and a prisoner of war brought forth to determine their success or their miscarriage was an omen of the utmost importance  Of their public spectacles little is to be said Their young men however frequently exhibited  one which you will think pretty extraordinary and yet in conformity with the ferocity of their manners They would jump naked into the middle of a sort of theatre encircled with lances leaving only almost impossible mazes between them for the whole arrangement formed a labyrinth of spears The dexterity consisted in threading these meanders and performing the circuit of the whole narrow and almost indiscernable path with infinite rapidity and without drawing blood and they thought themselves sufficiently rewarded if by these hazardous feats they amused the spectators  Now my dear friend amongst all the perilous arts which have been invented by idle people in modern times to entrap the money of persons as idle as themselves some by swallowing flintstones some fire c I think we have never yet matched this pleasant exercise of the youth of old Batavia and therefore if the enterprising Astley Hughes or any other great men who trade in the marvelous could attempt something of this kind with the improvement perhaps of a little  drapery  to the picturesetting the tour of the lancesurrounded hero to music it might give  us all the address and agility of their most expert tumblers and posturemasters without any of their abominable distortion  Suppose you were to give one of them the hint and when these letters come into volumes to make him a present of a copy doubling down the page By this act of courtesey you would at least gain the free  entré  of a winter's run to all the jugglers tricksters brutes upon two legs and brutes upon four Nay I know not but the thing might with better effect be brought upon the stage under the title of Harlequin in Old Holland Worse scats have been enacted by the hero of the wooden sword and truncheon and if he could but once dance round this Batavian gauntlet  al fresco  he might bid defiance to the hackneyed worn out pursuits of Panteloon and fooleries of Scaramouch  But to leave sporting and return to our proper objects It remains only to say a few words on the  ancient  legislation and public assemblies of the United States An account of the  modern  government shall not be forgotten  When they began to legislate which was not till long after their settlement in this country the sovereignty resided in a kind of National Convention It was there that their freemen and nobles inaugurated their generals and kings there that they elected their centurions tribunes and judges to distribute justice through their colonies there that their first Diet was established either at new or full moon when all subjects were discussed and propositions made for peace or war The unanimity of the suffrage determined the measure if the spectators clapped their hands the ayes had it and if a tumultuous murmur followed the proposal the noes carried the question  In this little senate's origin every man appeared armed When the youths had gained a certain age they were admitted as members and on the dayif I may be permitted to use parliamentary languagethat they took their seats they were presented with a javelin and buckler They were then to be considered as connecting the characters of senator and soldier and expected to contribute their services to the government and defence of the states  With respect to the monarchy of the rude ages of the Batavian people the name of king has been too generally confounded with that of chief Whatever was then his title his power exceeded not that of the first citizen there was always an appeal from his authority to the sense of the public and if his elevation inspired any sentiment or carried him into any action that wore but the semblance of tyranny or that trenched upon those to whom he owed his distinctions he was instantly marked and controlled as one who had violated his trust and incurred the penalty of such forfeiture  The legislature of the country demands a few more observations for even in the infancy the babyhood of Batavian jurisprudence the most wholesome laws were framed though their code was little more than what was taught by a sense of natural justice and perhaps that is conscience at the same time The very people who in their most barbarous state fed their indolence by invasion of public and private rights in process of time began to contemplate with horror and with shame a life of laziness and rapacity They were industrious and on industry grew the sentiments  both of property and probity and they soon enacted laws to tie up themselves as well as others from the farther violation of these  They were however simple and concise The superior magistrates in the great districts and the inferior ones in the towns and villages conducted the process It was carried on without any sort of difficulty or delay and what will equally confound our modern lawyers without any expence The cause was tried in open court and invariably ended the  day it was begun  without a possibility of farther appeal Neither written laws nor printed statutes were known or necessary to be known Privileges rights and wrongs when well defended and settled  in foro conscientiae  remain for ever clear and were men as honest as they are artful would require but one hearing and one decision A twenty or even a fifth year's suit in Chancery would have sounded in Batavia like putting off the final issue to the day of judgment But I am aware that society in its highest state of population power and passion must  have its wrongs mingled with its rights and they are so twisted together by a variety of interests that we must take them just as we find them worked into the piece So may the  laws  flourish and we enjoy their protection my friend without either incurring their censure or wanting their active interference for perhaps as many honest men have been ruined by their friendship as there have been knaves destroyed by their enmity  LETTER XXV TO THE SAME  HAVING thus taken a transient view of "the family canvass" in the long picture gallery of times past we shall be more amused to look at and better able to judge of the portraits of the lineal descendants in fine we shall with more profit and more pleasure catch the resembling similitudes observe where the impression of original character has been preserved or lost and from this progressive survey invest ourselves with the power of comparing progenitors with their posterity in all that regards the principles and pursuits of both These as I glean or rather as I find spirits and leisure to arrange and parcel out for remember I have now the pickings of half a year in my portable storehouse but lying in heaps shall be sent you  Meantime as what I have already exported will make a pretty considerable sheaf I shall beg of you to look upon this letter as the band  to make it up and as every harvesthome is accompanied by signs of satisfaction that the grain is got in such as garlands songs c c as not even the humblest Gleaner who has picked her scanty portion from day to day through all the leasing season but adorns the last handful with a few field flowers and carols over them as she bends her way to her cottage I propose to crown our little harvesthome my friend with a wreath of poetry to which there appertains a long story but which I persuade myself a mind like your's will find short in the narration when the time is ripe to "ask your hearing patiently" as the player says in Hamlet  Much have I for your fancy your feelings your affection much for your information and something for your use Matter for my affections in Holland methinks I hear those who have found or determined to think it barren soiltauntingly exclaimAny thing that can interest my fancy in that region of fogs bogs and vapours then shall the spices of the east eject their fragrance from the ditch and the roses of Paradise bloom in the fen  You remember Yorick's beautiful passage beginning"I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Bathsheba and cry all's barren and so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers c" Be that my answer to all such children of spleen prejudice or wilful blindness Be the rest of the sentence implicating a tenderness of nature and a candour of spirit so expressive of your heart a pledge to you that whenever you make a residentiary tour of this country your affections your imagination your feeling will not want their proper objects You will not be reduced to "fasten them on the sweet myrtle" or on the "melancholy cypress" but be presented with many opportunities of enjoying  "The feasts of reason and the flow of soul"  notwithstanding what has so often and by so many different people been said to the contrary that dullness and the Dutch nation are become synonimous  I am really concerned to find every where and about every thing the representations of a truth in many respects so different and in  not a few so diametrically opposite to the truth itself Men women places people manners customs are all so drawn into this false colouring and are so thrown out of their due proportions of mind and body situation and circumstance here a caricature there a figure so fulsomely flattered that a friend that loves one would be disgusted and in short things as they are so very generally differ from what they are said to be that in whatsoever I can I am fully resolved to form my opinions on the evidence of my own senses as in all human cases the only proof positive and in whatever falls short of this oral and ocular conviction still humanly speaking to believe whatever is of good report as much as I dare and of evil no more than I can possibly help  With respect to the tales of travellers those of the Genii and Fairies are not more fanciful or fallacious when they choose to throw the rein upon the neck of prejudice or imagination which they are very often sufficiently disposed to do The tricks they play on their readers are the more dangerous when they are expert enough at illusion to keep on this side  of the line of probability which can neither on or off the stage be violated without counteracting the effect intended to be produced  What would you think of me said a sprightly young man in a letter to his relation the Baroness De S what would you think of your cousin and correspondent who stops only to refresh himself and when refreshed writes to you  en passant  were he in imitation of many travellers to give himself the airs of a dictator and talk of the dispositions of a people the customs of a country their finance their government their passions their pursuits risquing every thing fearing nothing not even the derision and contempt of the friend he addresses How in fact is it possible to avoid sending falsehoods of one country into another when running from country to country as if in a foxchace without knowledge of the language without becoming stationary amongst the people without comparing the living volume with the dead letter with many social and many silent opportunities a true  idea  much less a faithful description of men and things should be given If a traveller  en gallop  would content himself with "catching the manners as they  rise before him at the moment" his etching might often be agreeable always just as far as it went but he must be an historian a politician a philosopher and take up his pen to convince his private friend and perhaps the world that he knows or can know no more of the matter than a courier or a running footman I touched on this folly before my dear friend but I have since that time been so misled by trusting to false guides have lost so much of my time and my money by their advice about the distribution of it that thatin fine that lest I should lose my temper into the bargain I will only reassure you it is not without  reason  the United Provinces have been often called the compendium of the universe and that notwithstanding a very entertaining traveller has declared in a kind of epigrammatic tour that he has publishedMartin Sherlockthe cardinal virtue of a Dutchman is cleanliness his only Gods Mercury and Plutus and as for the Nine Sisters and Apollo they were never heard of in the country notwithstanding it is insisted upon in a volume of our universal history that the Dutch are cold phlegmatic brutal without a ray of invention a shadow of  liberty genius reflection or forecast that love was never known to sigh in the nation that the only passions are glutting and avarice notwithstanding even the Abbé Raynal himself has condescended to join the herd of calumniators  certainement en de périodes arrondies et de belles phrases  I will venture to unite with a good old writer who visited this country near a century ago when it was comparatively rude and unimproved to what it now is and who justly remarked that he who hath observed the easy accommodation for travel in Holland their excellent order and regular course in all things the number of learned men the variety of ingenious foreigners constantly residing in or passing through it the abundance of rarities of all kinds the industry frugality and wealth of the people their numerous towns each extremely beautiful their proper laws and administration of justice their incredible number of shipping and boats a country of little extent indeed and soon passed over but so replenished with objects of curiosity commerce profit and pleasure that not to admire it is to be devoured with prejudice spleen or insensibility  My loved friend where there is taste judgment and a heart there will be always objects to employ them You can therefore never find a sterile spot on any part of the earth and in these Provinces had you made the tour in them as often as I have and stopped as long in each you would still say as Titus does to Berenice in the French play  "Depuis deux ans entiers chaque jour je la vois  "Et crois toujours la voir pour la premiere fois"  And this reminds me of the verses which were to form the bandeau of my first sheaf or volume and which you may imagine I have forgot Ah no I shall never forget them while I am alive to the memory of sensations of gratitude elegance or social pleasure for amidst such were they written in the bosom of a numerous family from each of whom I found comfort in affliction attendance in sickness and felicitations on recovery that made me almost congratulate myself that I had been both unwell and unhappy Of all this I will one day  "A round unvarnish'd tale deliver"  Meanwhile accept the poetical bouquet an offering of justice to the talents of one of the family party  NATURE  to  MRS **********  ON CUTTING  But lest you should imagine the Muse is here sacrificing to Gratitude only I must enter a caveat by observing to you in honest plain prose that the imitations of Nature here alluded to are really so beautiful that if Nature herself did not  m  stake  them for her own she need not be ashamed to  own  them  BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND FRUITS OUT OF CARROTS AND TURNIPS  MADAM  THE God who made the world and saw it fair  Gave it

You'll make between you  Summer all the year  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME  SUPPLEMENTARY LETTERS  LETTER I TO THE SAME  ON a survey of my stores however under the article "  Scraps  or Single Wheat Ears and Field Flowers collected in Holland and arranged at the Brielle" the place whence I culled the fragrant Bandeau which binds the Gleaning I last sent you I judge it best to attach them to this my first sheaf You will therefore receive them herewith in some Supplementary Letters just as you may have observed an industrious daylabourer in  the leasing season following his gleaning family home gathering up the ears that may drop from their pleasing burthens as they bear them to the cottage And first I shall offer to your feelings some emigrant histories  Even  before  the cloud broke into flame it was really afflicting to see in passing the Frontiers of Germany the situation of the French emigrants the greater part of whom were of the first rank and reduced like those of the la  t to subsist on the good faith and good will of those in whose towns and villages they had taken refuge But good will and good faith like all other things have their bound and like all other things too are subject to contingence I staid long enough in the different retreats of these unhappy people to perceive that the protection at first offered was amongst the objects of this changeable world that shew early signs of earthly mutability Whether tendered in the beginning by urbanity pity or politics the warmth of the welcome began to abate I saw but too often the altered air of the host cut into the heart of his guest The protections were not indeed nay are not even yet withdrawn but infinitely different is the being endured  and invited being suffered to remain and sollicited to continue  The severe chagrin which this caused in an highspirited and highborn set of men whose sensibility is always in proportion to rank habits and education may easily be guessed but their endeavours to  conceal  that chagrin from the people with whom they have taken refuge and yet more from the lower orders of their own country exhibited to the observing eye a picture truly touching Prior to the breaking out of the war I was at Neuwied and Coblentz at the latter place you remember I died and from these towns notwithstanding my death I passed into many others while hostilities were preparing and I found wherever the French emigrants were permitted to have "a local habitation" you might see this inward struggle betwixt  blood and situation  I frequently observed the expatriated Noblesse gather together towards evening in the suburbs surrounded by several hundreds of their adherents not to abuse the time but to engage in all those manly exercises which served a triple purpose First to hide their regret from common spectators secondly to obviate for a  time the sense of their condition thirdly to support and cultivate that strength of body and mind which grief and idleness might impair I took notice that their swords were either at their sides or lying by them even in their sports But  I was lodged in the same hotel with a number of these unhappy gentlemen some months  after  all this I have followed them into their private apartments where their minds no longer on the stretch relaxed and yielded to the truth of circumstance Yet without particularizing the general survey was lamentable Many thousands of human beings in the highest rank and of the highest talents bred to the enjoyment and expenditure of ample fortunes driven from their possessions in the pleasantest gayest and most agreeable country of the world or what very lately was such of great natural vivacity and of habitual elegance all of them reduced by what at least to  them  appears a virtue in excess the love of their king their country the maintainance of their hereditary rights and the recovery of their patrimonial honour My friend however these unfortunates may fare on your side of the German Ocean I have seen hundreds of them on this side constrained like the poor soldier to take their cold lodging on a bed of straw their nourishment coarse as their bed  far from their friends their wives their children their estates confiscated themselves exiled  Was not all this and much more that might with too much truth be added enough to break down the highest spirit and unbrace the strongest arm Stand they not according to the expression of a great Divine "in the first rank of objects of our sympathy entitled not only to relief but respect and veneration" A set of men born in and inured to far less polishing and as they are usually thought more emasculating circumstances such as a cold country a rigorous discipline and a less ardent temperament might seem wanting to support this sad reverse For Frenchmen and more particularly for French  nobility  to bear it with an equal mind without taking into the account the  rapidity  of a transition from the liveliest and most abundant to the most gloomy and unsupplied state certainly shews of what these once airy spirits are capable when called out by an extraordinary occasion  From these primary surveys I plainly foresaw what has since happened viz that when these wretched wanderers did come into action  they would maintain their share in the dreadful day of open rupture as firmly and as bravely as if they had never known a softness or indulged a luxury But  long before  the time was ripe to enter the field of blood it would have wrung your heart to have seen the unaccommodated situation of thousands who have since shed their blood in  la Vendée  a name not to be mentioned without an association of horrors and sacrifices from which every reflecting mind must turn with  shuddering sympathy  for if ever human creatures were devoted on  all sides  these are they who must everlastingly stand in the first rank of victims and whether their destruction arose from the cold delays of policy or from the malice of adverse fortune the families the legions the armies the almost  miriads  of persons who found untimely graves in that illstay'd country are the most to be honoured compassionated and deplored Peace to their ashes and recompence to their souls  LETTER II TO THE SAME  I HAD scarce entered the Hotel on my first visit to this town when the death of the late Emperor was announced by an express who came into the Inn yard from Vienna illustrating the expression of the Great English Poet where he tells us a Cavalier had  "Spurr'd his proud Courser hard and rode in blood"  Although the deceased was as well beloved of his subjects as it is in the nature of things to be it is amazing with what philosophical composure this event was received by all who were not personally or politically interested Being myself neither the one nor the other I mention it but to tell you the surprize of a very large company on my informing them while sitting at a table d'hote supper that as their emperor and king was dead I should put on my suit of sables For what have you the honour to be related Related No but I presume every gentleman who can command  a black coat will wear it on this occasion at least every gentleman who resides in the German dominions  Not an individual in the whole empire replied my next neighbour except those of the royal family and its immediate connections with the officers of the household  Very strange Sir our English taylors work double tides to get mourning ready in time for the general order  Order what are you then commanded  Yes both by etiquette and custom Not a gentleman lady or decent trader in the realm will think himself entitled to appear amongst even his familiar friends unless he conforms to the rule which in our private parties and public places is almost without an exception Within eight and forty hours after the news gets to England its inhabitants will all be as black as the Styx and so remain 'till another edict of the Lord Chamberlain who is our Grand Master of little ceremonies tells our sympathy it may assume a slighter shade and fix at the same time the period of our regaining our robes of colour  Monsieur Anglois cried a profound personage at the farther end of the table your's is a mighty sympathizing nation truly but though we love our sovereigns perhaps more than you we mourn for them in our hearts and do not hang the trappings of our sorrow on our backs nor are we single in this matter our neighbours of Holland will be no blacker next week than  usual  here our German wit smiled significantly even though you know the alliances of the Houses of Orange Prussia and England compose a sort of family compact  They told me simply the truth with respect to themselves and the Dutch for in passing back into the United Provinces a few days after then returning into Germany by way of Westphalian Prussia I met with but three sets of beings arrayed in the mourning garb to wit some of the friars the crows and the blackbirds Notwithstanding which there seems to me a dignity and decorum in this custom which attaches me to it  The event itself even in the instant it happened seemed in no degree to have checked the designs of the emigrants No form of  words can paint to you the vehemence the indignation the almost insanity with which in a journey through the different parts of the empire I have heard their grievances discussed their wrongs described their rights asserted and their ravages anticipated To these violences if there could possibly be found in the language of passions a parallel it would be heard in the phrenzies of the Revolutionists Even at the time of which I am speaking both parties were in a ferment beyond the reach of perhaps  any  comparison in ancient or modern history But what is extremely curious in this dispute is that while the Emigrants insist that  they themselves  are made up of gentry men of property and nobility nothing being left in France except its refuse the favourers of the Republic aver that no man has  left  his native land who was worthy to stay in it meantime allowance being made for these overcharged animosities on both sides it was palpable that when the gathering storm burst it would pour down the torrents of human blood which  have  since deluged the land  In regard to the  expatriated  French I can speak to the claims of several to all that admiration or sympathy can offer and they  have given largely since especially in the British dominions About the time that the armies of Dumourier were upon the point of seizing the Republic of Holland in the summer of I was as you well remember amongst the number of those who did not think it prudent to wait the event of a threat which was expected with anxiety by every man But resolved to wait till the last apparently safe minute I resorted to the house of a friend which lying in the highway passage to Helveotsluice I had an opportunity of Gleaning many hundredsI might safely write thousands of those who were hastening to England and as my friend's house was partly appropriated to the service of his Britannic Majesty they were obliged to make a stop officially their passports from Holland to the British shore being attainable only from this quarter And farther my friend uniting much private worth with his public character very many of these unfortunate persons were so "gaily and smilingly pressed to stay" that so long as the danger of the French army was not immediate they profited of his hospitality for two or three days together By these means princes generals chevaliers women of quality and whole bodies of the priesthood passed under my  eye and I had made my Gleaning of their minds manners and pretensions their miseries at home and their hardships abroad before they had gained our protecting country  In truth the house above alluded to gave them a very favourable impression of British courtesy for being composed of the elegant wife and blooming daughters of my friend these children of misfortune met a variety of  agrémens  well suited to their present circumstances It would have charmed you to have seen as I did the family endeavours to dissipate the chagrin too heavy not to be observed in the countenances and heard in the sighs of many of the sufferers  "Their gestures sad  Investing lanklean cheeks or warworn coats  Presenting them unto the gazing moon  So many horrid ghosts  It was truly piteous to hear this ruined band descant on their general or particular misfortunes the infinite losses they sustained before they left their own country the difficulty and disorder in which they quitted it the extortions made upon them both by land and by water in their passage A Dutch landlord  for instance had insisted on a small party paying  five French crowns  for tea milk and a little dry bread  I was extremely interested by three Chevaliers of different orders of merit who came together always united by friendship and now more strongly knit by the cement of misfortune Of these one produced written testimonies of having twice saved the life of Louis XVI His wife was left in hazard at Paris his faithful domestic who followed him to the wars was taken prisoner and hanged at Lisle Another had escaped with his lady to Dieppe but was there constrained to leave her and the third had been lucky enough to bring away his wife in disguise but since had the misfortune to understand that his children who were in one of the Provinces for education had been seized upon and brought to the guillotine to atone for the crimes of their parents the crimes of loyalty to their king and saving themselves from death trusting that the innocent children would be no objects of that universal  edict of blood  which has since been issued  The name of the first of these gentlemen was St Leger of a noble person and a noble  mind covered over with laurels and the wounds by which they were acquired Without gasconade he bade me take note of them as they stood displayed in different parts of his bodysome received at Pondicherry in a former war some in Flanders most of them by  British shot  but  all  Sir exclaimed the Marquis such was his title in the service of  my  sovereign and I am sure that will be a sufficient apology to the forgiveness and a sufficient motive to the protection of  your  sovereign  He renounced the name of Frenchman he said and gloried that he was of Irish ancestry nor do I renounce only a Frenchman's  Considering him as an officer and friend to the Prince who had been his benefactor we must allow him this latitude  name  Sir said the Marquis but a Frenchman's  language  and the very moment I can recover that of England I shall deem it dosloyal nay a crime to speak a tongue in common with the traitors of a king whom I have defended from my earliest youth and whom I will continue to love and honour to my latest age  I think my knowledge of the human heart warrants me without too much relying on the  human voice or human countenance in asserting that he spoke with sincerity when he said farther that if he could save his devoted master by the loss of his left hand or right extending both while he asseverated he would offer them up with joy and kiss the hand of the man appointed to cut them off  His personal character of Louis founded as he assured me on personal knowledge differed essentially from the common received opinion The Marquis de St Leger represented him not only as a man of general goodness but of general knowledge of great reading observation and courage Of the latter he instanced as follows When the cannon of the enraged populace were dragged into his palace and the swords of fifty blood thirsty hirelings were at his throat and when asked by the ringleaders whether LOUIS  was not afraid  He took hold of one of the grenadiers arms desiring him to feel whether the heart of Louis palpitated with any of the dastard emotions imputed to it But he must die Sir added the Marquis I foresee Sir that Louis XVI  must  soon die It is according to the new system that he should be destroyed nor will any part of his  illfated family left in France fare better than himself  They are all proscribed  The strength of the axiom self preservation is the first of Nature's laws we will not ask why the Marquis or any other person who foresaw the death and had been benefitted by the life of Louis XVI left him to his fate    How far this prophecy is fulfilled my dear friend you need not be told  In the course of the evening on which these conversations took place the three Chevaliers took a measure and perhaps an inadequate and partial one of each other's particular situation each admitted a similitude in  general  calamity but each thought some trait of harder and more difficult fortune was appropriate in particular to himself The two who had been compelled to leave their wives in an enemy's land of course considered  their  Lot as the most severe while the third whose children had fallen sacrifices to their parents security seemed to think the fate of his two friends more tolerable than his own  I have the conversation of the Countess my wife it is true said the Count de R and no man can be more sensible of domestic consolation than I am but as there seemsto me no apparent  end  to the horrors of France and as  the slight means with which we have provided our selves are already on the decline I know not whether death itself would not have been a blessing to me rather than living to see my slender finances diminish daily and the beloved of my soul condemned to forget or remember with anguish the decent pride of hereditary and habitual independence or be in danger of starving under the eyes of a tender husband As to the latter grievance it can  never come to pass  observed the Countess while we have both of us so much youth health and affection And though my inward soul bewails the loss of our loved children yet as their innocent lives must have ensured them eternal happiness there are moments when I  congratulate them and ourselves  on their being placed beyond the reach of the tygers who now infest our country and who would have drank their blood  Yes dear Count their lot is no longer to be deplored and I have almost ceased to grieve for them  During every sentence of this declaration her tears fell in abundance and she exhibited all the agonies of a mother who had lost her children while she talked of resignation  The amiable family under whose hospitable roof these unfortunates were now received tried the magic of their various accomplishments to charm away the no less various distresses of their guests The different enchantments of music converse and cards were by turns put in force and had their effects but what seemed most to interest and amuse was putting together one of the wooden maps of Europe invented it is said for the improvement of the young and happy but calculated as it appeared in this instance to sooth the wretched and the mature As the component parts of this plaything were presented in disorder the emigrants began to arrange in progress of which they had no little difficulty The Marquis was for throwing  France  wholly out of the Map being no longer worthy he said to fill a space in the Continent of Europe This was opposed by his friend who fastened with a tender sort of misery on  Dieppe  where he had last left his wife but he agreed partially to eject  Paris  to this proposal however the other after a short pause objected for the like reason with the additional one of its being still the residence of his beloved king whose very prison house was precious And both the countess and her husband were for preserving  all the cities towns and villages which still contained their surviving friends O had you seen the pallid hue which seized their cheeks and the tears that filled their eyes as they pointed to the place where stood their patrimonial mansion and where their murdered children were  born  you would have felt that the recollection of past happiness and the sight of any dear spot in "the mind's eye" are amongst the griefs that however poignant the sense of altered fortune cannot be thought of or looked at without some emotions of consolation  I was myself an advocate for allowing France its place in the hope that every part of the company who were its natives would return to it one day with honour and joy  Throw but a lure to the Frenchgive them in their deepest affliction the slenderest clue though no stronger than a silken thread direct but their hearts to the remotest hope that the sunshine of happier and fairer days is or may be in reserve and the present  cloud  however obtuse seems already to begin dispersing and you will see them as it were come dancing from behind it  The then improbable and now alas almost impossible idea of returning to their homes renovated in a moment their before despairing spirits and for the rest of the evening they were less afflicted than those who pitied them I have observed many instances of this felicity of constitution habit or country How in all instances but particularly in the present condition of their lives and fortunes are they to be gratulated upon it  In the packetboat which some time after this little adventure took me to England there were not less than eighty emigrant French on their passage to London I had reason to know that they left other countries either by command of the Governors or from terror of an approaching enemy and that the greater part of them so far from having wherewith to make London a comfortable residence had barely sufficient to pay their fare at an  indulged  price over the water Yet meeting with a few persons who  had been in Paris  who described its splendours its seducing elegancies and its amusing trifles they forgot the present in the past and were by no means the least gay or merry of the crew Half seas over however one of the sailors descried from the mast a vessel  of an unpromising appearance bearing down upon us and favoured by the wind The Captain pronounced it to be a French privateer and as far as his glasses could determine one that would take them captive with a single broadside At the close of this information he observed that though it would be a vain effort it was his duty to clear the ship for fighting This was accordingly done and the emigrants were not the least alert in the preparation nor would they it is likely have been the least vigorous in the action but on some of them the dread of falling into the hands of their implacable countrymen was so great that in case of defeat they came to the desperate resolve of becoming their own executioners in the short interval betwixt the giving up the packetboat and the boarding of her by the conquerors The alarm increased as the vessel approached and the resolution became so solemn that each man who meant to adopt it pledged his honour to his friend Possibly it might in a case of death be the least evil in point of sufferance and shame however it might violate the laws of morality and religion It was luckily an unnecessary alternative for the vessel coming near enough to be satisfied she had been in chase of an English packet boat proved herself  to be an English frigate and soon stood off in the direction she had quitted on first observing us "After all she's  one of us"  cried the captain The instantaneous effect of the remark on the emigrants would have been astonishing to a spectator not acquainted with their temperament  Those who had the most despairing thoughts had now the gayest ideas and such as had been most agile in preparing for war gave proof of agility in the contrary extreme of preparing for peace for they leaped laughed sung and even played as it were with the edge of the guillotine one facetiously observed that he fancied his neck feeling it was too  short  to be fitted to the instrument and another cunningly said though he did not think  his  neck too  short  he hoped it would be  long enough  before any experiment was made upon it by  Mess les Republicains  while a third gentleman with a shrug which would have ascertained his country had every other testimony been wanting remarked  "Ma foi cétte dame Guillotine est un personage bien commode au service de ces gueux là mais pour moi il ne me conviens pas du tout du tout"  "On my word that Mr Guillotine is a mighty convenient gentleman  in the cause of those beggarly patriots nevertheless it is not at all to my taste" In short my friend if the immediate circumstances of the present moment are not absolutely threatening if good company good wine gay conversation or any other pleasant object of the senses are within the reach or in the view of these beings the past and future are forgotten This is not I am now convinced what is generally thought and as I myself once supposed the effect of little sensibility of much levity and a total want of solid reflection but proceeds in great measure as I have before observed from constitutional felicity Yet you are too well skilled in the equal laws of nature and providence to infer from hence that the French are from this bias more blessed than the rest of mankind If they annihilate all that is gone by and all that may come when the "Cynthia of the minute" smiles before them they suffer with a bitterness of despondence peculiar to themselves all that  has  afflicted them or that  may  afflict when the  present  is but a continuation of their gloom They then collect all the disastrous parts of time into one point of misery The past present and future seem through this focus but as one mass accumulated like  so many mountains to crush them and they feel the weight of adversity if I may so express myself in all its tenses In the English Dutch and German minds I think it is different Amidst the thickest glooms of their condition whatever be their degrees of natural feeling they bear the heavy  collection  of grief with more equanimity Either their minds are stronger or their sensibility weaker and besides education climate and habits may contribute but it brings into equipoise the allotments of heaven and the dispensations of nature whose system is perhaps the only possible one in which equality can subsistthe equality of human happiness since she has made with very few exceptions almost all her children though not partakers of the same felicity proceeding from the same causes nearly the same in effects To bring this matter home to the scene I have been relating had these passengers been unmoved in the degree that a Dutch family felt themselves the males smoking and the females snuffing all the time upon deck they would have suffered less panic at the time of clearing the ship and by the same rule they would have enjoyed less when the danger was over  "God in the nature of each being founds  "Its  proper  bliss"  And thus it may be pronounced that one man is upon  the whole of life  allowing always exceptions as happy as another  "The learn'd is happy nature to explore  "The fool is happy that he knows no more  "The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n  "The poor contents him with the care of heav'n  "See the blind beggar dance the cripple sing  "The fot a hero lunatic a king  "The starving chymist in his golden views  "Supremely blest the poet in his Muse"  If then by the very laws of nature my dear friend the universally varied situations of human life are thus happily arranged why presume to invest her laws by introducing a  forced  and  unnatural  equality that is by making all men different from what they have been by forcing them from their natural and proper stations and by making them as universally discontented with their past and present state as they have been contented Miserably will the founders of the new Republic be disappointed if they seriously conceive that by making the ignorant learned or the poor rich or still worse by making  all alike  they shall increase the felicity of mankind By a change  of condition they may make the industrious idle and the humble dissatisfied but never can either the dissatisfied or the idle be happy There is a passage from the noble poem I have just quoted so decisive on this great question which now agitates the globe that surely the reasoning is as strong and indisputable as the poetry is sweet and beautiful It has all the condensation of thought for which Pope is so justly celebrated and methinks should be written in letters of gold in a translation suited to all languages and solemnly read as an article of political civil and religious faith by all the now contending nations and indeed all the neutral nations of the earth On the tablet of every BRITISH memory that has but a relish of poesy it is  already  engraved but by many even of those who have it by rote it seems by the last accounts you sent me from England to have left so little impression that were I rich enough I should be so far from contenting myself with the narrow diffusion of these volumes that I would print the passage and disperse it amongst my countrymen throughout every part of the realm  "  Order is Heav'n's first law  and this confess'd  "Some are and must be greater than the rest  "More rich more wise but who infers from hence  "That such are happier shocks all common sense  "Heav'n to mankind impartial we confess  "If all are equal  in their happiness  "But mutual wants this happiness increase  "  All nature difference keeps all nature's peace  "Condition circumstance is not the thing  "Bliss is the same in subject or in king  "In who obtain defence or who defend  "In him who is or him who wants a friend  "Heav'n breathes through every member of the whole  "One common blessing and one common soul  "But fortune's gifts if  each alike  possess'd  "And each  were equal  must not all contest  "Fortune her gifts may variously dispose  "And these be happy call'd unhappy those  "  But heav'n's just balance equal will appear  "While those are plac'd in hope and these in fear  "Nor present good or ill the joy or curse  "But future views of better or of worse"  It is more than probable the  The reader has in mind I extend not this to the  present  late violent rulers of the French were secretly  aware  of the great truths comprised in these sentiments and that the present more political conductors are no less conscious of their force although it may be still necessary to make a hueandcry about liberty equality and confraternity and when they have settled their ambition in the best and surest manner for  themselves  they will no doubt convince the subordinate classes of  the republic that the word liberty in the new dictionary of France is to mean no more than  an uncontrouled and sovereign will of certain individuals in convention to govern the rest of mankind  and that  Confraternity  and  Equality  were  convenient cant words and nick names  used in the beginning of the French revolution as mere tools to work with by the Republican Masons but which are now become obsolete and are to be thrown like other plausible trumpery amidst the common lumber And it cannot be doubted but that at least ninetynine out of every hundred persons will find should the present system  "A mighty  maze  but not without a  plan"  succeed in acquiring any thing like a durable basis that the grand majority have been considered as nothing more than journeymen who unless new work is cut out for them by their employers may lie out of business for the rest of their lives with the aggravated reflection of having thrown themselves out of good places under one master for the miserable trade of building castles which with respect to themselves at least will prove to be raised in the air  To return however to the emigrants of that unhappy country I must very distinctly point out to you amongst these the Vicomte de Gand a man of such versatility of talent that he appears to have an appropriate genius for every occasion since in the whole course of the twentyfour hours could the assembly continue unbroken he has powers to occupy them without fatigue and to make them glide unperceived awayinsomuch that it may be truly said  "  Milton  With him conversing you forget all time"  The airy and elegant levities of France the solid reflective powers of England the softening  agrémens  of Italy seem to meet as if by the common consent of nations in this man's character and as he shifts  "  Pope  From grave to gay from lively to severe"  in different languages each country not only for the sake of his accomplishments but his virtues might be proud to  "  Gray  Mark him for its own"  He has resided for some time past in London where you may have had an opportunity to see and hear that he is not overrated in my description It is a tribute of justice due to a man from whose conversation I have received the highest social pleasure and although just as it is it would bring me to the guillotine were I a French patriot it is a tribute which I should pay even to one of  those patriots  were I to find an equal assemblage of great and happy endowments independent on their political jargon and madness of the moment Honest praise is of no party my dear friend and it is very compatible to applaud talents and detest principles in the same character In this instance the admiration of one includes that of the other  After having said this you will be prepared for a little poetical gleaning which my muse made of the viscount as he sat at the table encircled by a number of his admirers each of whom he had enlivened by his wit improved by his judgment or amused by his fancy for several hoursI have only to beg you will consider it the poetry of the moment flowing from the heart into the social current of conversation and not elaborated by study  THE CONTENTION  FROM hapless France to Britain came  One whom so  many  parents claim  That those who know him best declare  To fifty fathers he is heir  Yet ev'ry fire protests this son  Belongs to him and  him alone  Says WIT his sparkling eye's on fire  Enflam'd that others should aspire  By heav'n the viscount's only  mine  I claim him sirs by right divine  Cries FANCY with affliction wild  Fearing to lose her darling child  WIT cease to boast I will not share  With thee  my  just and wellknown heir  Then swift from heav'n the God of  song  Came down to swear they both were wrong  By all that Phoebus loves 'tis known  Pretenders that the  count's my own  In each of these the C de G is preeminent  Dance music poesy unite  To publish and support  my  right  Sage WISDOM then with solemn face  Declar'd Apollo must give place  Since 'tis by all the world confess'd  WISDOM his cultur'd mind has dress'd  But FASHION ELEGANCE and EASE  Three great though modern deities  Len him  their  varied powers to please  Said SENSIBILITY you go  Too far  my  rights from nature flow  And who quoth COURAGE of  my  part  Shall rob me of my viscount's heart  Mars and Bellona both declare  He's  our's  by all the  rights of war  And by yet  greater  powers we swear  De Gand is  our  peculiar care  Jove smiling heard them from above  And bade the strife conclude in love  Ye ALL assisted at his birth  Exclaim'd the Sire of heaven and earth  One cannot boast beyond the rest  SHARE HIM AMONGST YOU and be blest  And now for a review of the Dutch troops by the Prince Stadtholder who is fond of military discipline and in point of bravery and skill a not unworthy descendant of the illustrious house of Orange  During one of my former Gleanings at this Briellehome as I used to call it on account of the apartment always sacred to my returns happened the annual visitation of the Prince Stadtholder who yearly makes a tour of the States to inspect his garrisons and to review his soldiers Although of an athletic and somewhat dropsical form and of a heavy appearance which indeed is usually attached thereto the mind of this prince is active and notwithstanding a constitutional weakness  in his knees he is said to be capable of enduring incredible fatigue Well is it that he is so for some trying ones happened to him on the day abovementioned the business of which included an examination of the forces of the Republic both at the Brielle and Helveotsluice He arrived at the former about eight in the morning from his residence at the Hague which is a distance of four leagues Every body expected him in their best dresses and for that day at least in their best looks the streets were lined with town militia under arms and the manycoloured flags of different states were waving over the canals and I do verily think more than two hundred were hoisted on Poles at the doors of the Burghers every street every avenue every window was crouded with the sons and in yet greater numbers with the daughters of curiosity whose family is to be found you know in all countries and I do assure you as many of its branches are resident amidst these torpid Dutch dikes and standing pools as near more rapid waters In his way to the Brielle his highness had two small arms of the Maese to pass but he was no sooner descried on the opposite side of the first than the usual demonstrations of joy real or counterfeit  began cannon were fired from the ramparts and all the bells of all the churches were in tune to greet him right loyally before his person  could be seen  At length appeared his barge which by the bye was most curiously bepainted and begilt there was given a general salute of the military I mean of the regulars in garrison to this succeeded an  apparently  universal huzza of the people I particularly remarked one man who had the same morning been pointed out to me as "  horriblement patriot"  who waved his hat higher and sent forth the voice of gratulation louder than the rest but it is the nature of every sort of hypocrisy to overact its part and frequently to betray what it  is  by the very attempt of appearing what it is  not  I saw his highness at a considerable distance It was not Cleopatra meeting Mark Anthony when she sailed down the Cydnos in the bark which Shakespeare has made immortal but it was perhaps a much better prince and certainly a much better man than that Roman coming to see that his bulwarks and their heroes were in a fit state to defend his subjects should defence be necessary as you know most necessary it was but too soon  His yacht came up the canal to the middle of the first street where he landed and was received by the garrison officers with all due ceremonies Unfortunately those ceremonies are performed  sans chapeau  with the hat off but the elements which are by no means respecters of persons were in this instance as in divers others wanting in common civility for just as the StadtholderPrince landed a most violent shower of rain burst incontinently on his illustrious head This torrent had been a long while collecting and could one suppose there was any mischievous waggery in a matter of this sort I should suppose the said torrent watched its opportunity to prove that Princes and mighty men were like coblers and the feeblest as well as meanest of mortals in the general designs of nature Methought however I observed three of the bareheaded officers cast up a sort of commanding yet fretful eye at the clouds while this  drenching morality  was pouring upon them as much as to say and "shall not gravitation cease as we go by" The Prince himself bore this "pelting of the pitiless storm" much better He had to stand hat in hand in the midst of it till he had settled the etiquette of receiving and returning at least fifty fine bows and gracious bendings all  which he did with the most magnanimous composure shaking the "big round drops" from his yet rounder face and sacred ears  In the like resigned way he set off breasting the hurricane which instead of yielding to his patience made head against him more violently He ran the military gauntlet of courtesy through all the principal streets and from thence to a meadow at the distance of a mile where tents were pitched to receive him I have a very great objection to take long walks in the rain albeit of a rambling disposition but I made it matter of conscience to expose myself to a good wetting on this great occasion You would not guess the grandeur of my soul in such a trying hour were I not to tell you on the faith of an historian that although I was armed with an umbrella I never spread it over my head by which emulative action I reduced myself to the situation of the prince himself except that I had still the advantage of him in the article of the head upon which I retained my hat thus gaining in comfort what I lost in glory Indeed I repented that I had carried the imitation of my superiors to the other parts of my body seeing that my apothecary's bill the consequence of taking  cold was neither paid by the StatesGeneral nor the Stadtholder as in the case of the military whose pay goes on when they are placed on the sick list especially if they become invalids by doing duty for me I did not get a single stiver to purchase sugarcandy and my cold cost me in that article and others the gross sum of  Five shillings  three guilders But I have purchased a cure for my cough and my ambition at the same time and were great men to swim up to their necks and little men to follow their example I shall never more be amongst their competitors being inveterately fixed not to wet my slipper any more for the sake of ambition though for that of humanity I hope I shall ever continue to venture far beyond my depth into the most  troubled  waters Many of the officers amongst whom were several pretty fellows looked as if they would have been glad to take shelter in the tents till the hurricane was over but the Prince resolved heroically to go through the morning business first and dashed through all the manoeuvres with the dispositions of a duck all his soldiers following his example of course though evidently with somewhat of the reluctance of a brood of chickens unnaturally fathered or  rather mothered upon the said duck Presently the air cleared the sun broke out and the weather became more favourable to the manoeuvres which were very adroitly performed and gave great satisfaction to the Prince who was indefatigable in his attention and attendance He did not finish at the Brielle till near three in the afternoon it must have been near five before he got to Helveotfluice and probably midnight ere he regained his palace Such are the taxes which governments levy upon the governors and I have not the smallest doubt but that this chief military commander of the Republic laid his deluged head that night upon the pillow heartily weary of preeminence and awoke to the consoling thought that he should not be condemned to pay so dear a price for a few huzzas till that time twelvemonths  My friend men are in the habit of calling kings and emperors tyrants when most of them at least now adays are invested with a kind of impotent dignity and are in a state of more incessant slavery than the meanest subject of their realms yet are often envied for those splendid vapours which are but the shining chains and trappings of that very slavery  more cumbrous and insupportable and the history of thrones alas scarce furnishes us with a monarch who might not exclaim with one of our own Henries even as he lies stretched on his couch of royalty  "Ah happy lowly clown  "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"  Adieu  LETTER III TO THE SAME  THE custom of marriages and burials are singular Respecting the first the parties if of the middling rank are dressed in a suit of sables on the nuptial day either to indicate the solemnity of the bond or as a  memento mori  that all hope of conquest should then be dead and buried at the foot of the altar  Funerals are no less remarkable A numerous body of the burghers in black gowns and decent bands attend the body of every deceased citizen The priests pastors c visit the house of the deceased which even as if it was wholly evacuated is shut up and that with most jealous caution till the morning of the burial the corpse is brought out by twelve burghers and carried by them not on shoulders but by hand to the grave where it is deposited without any prayer whatever though occasionally a sermon is preached The mourners  look into the yawning earth that is to hold their relation or friend and then depart They take off these "seemings of sorrow" or more properly speaking "the customary suits of common black" and mix in the business or diversions of the world  Amongst the advantages of a residentiary or a deliberate traveller who stays in a place long enough or visits it often enough to Glean its produce whether natural or accidental are those chances which throw you into the path of brother wanderers whether preparing to take the field or returning home with the harvest of observation from the different quarters of this wide world of enterprize Several of these the Chapter of Accidents has already presented some laden with wheat others only with chaff many with flowers and many with weeds and not a few again with a mixture of all these according to the constitution of Nature which is compounded of good bad and indifferent  During one of my residences alternately at the Hague and the Brielle I encountered two travellers of very opposite powers making as opposite impressions The one whom by way  of characteristic I shall call Mr Blank is of that order of travellers who give to every airy unimportance an inflated grandeur and describe every trifle with a pomp of words appropriate only to that herolcomic burlesque or false sublime which would very well become the mice and the frogs in the old sable I soon perceived this self imagined mountain was always in labour and brought forth nothing but some of the abovenamed animals yet that they were ushered into the world with all the pageantries of eastern phraseology as ridiculous and unnecessary as it would be to let off a cannon at a gnat which might more easily be exterminated by a fillip of the finger This Mr Blank so let me call one of them has travelled the Lord knows where and is going I believe in my conscience the Lord knows  not  whither for he talks of traversing regions where human enterprize has never yet directed itself of  terrae incognitae  of which human beings have no precise ideas of existence but which  be  is sure do exist and which it is reserved for him and him  alone  to explore Ah blissful vanity that can thus amuse thyself with the shining vapours of thy own selflove and thus give  "To airy  nothing  "A local habitation"  This Mr Blank travels with his works in his portmanteau enters an inn calls for pen and ink in a violent hurry to write down his last thoughts scribbles at full speed and notes  "Just ere it fall the Cynthia of the minute"  He joins the public dining tableintroduces  himself  and what he conceives to be the best part of him his works to the company  forces  his right and left hand neighbour to be his auditorsputs  one  morsel of meat into his mouth and sends out two of prose or poesy to his conceit far more relishingwhile the first course is removing he takes care to fill up the interval with the richest  en  remet  he serves  himself up again  begs the company to hear or read some favourite passage which has been admired copied and got by heart in every court of Europe rehearsed by minor emperors and spouted by queens Dowager but in the midst of reading being seized with a new idea he starts up regardless of his own appetite but happily leaving you to the enjoyment of your's runs out of the room or to the sideboard or makes a table of his plate turned topsyturvy and has scrawled half a sheet of paper before you can help yourself to a glass of wine for never surely did mortal  author produce such "an infinite deal of nothing" in so little time and he  talks  nonsense as fast as he  writes  it Happy powers but beware during his scribbling moments make on your part the best use of them or your dinner will be again in danger Our author returns to cram you with food that will add little to your nourishment and unless you prefer his windy banquet to good animal sustenance I see no escape but hunger and flight from a wellfilled table unless you follow the example of a pleasant gentleman who knowing the disposition of our traveller declared himself  deaf and blind  regretting at the same time in the politest terms on a slip of paper he scrawled in a written hint he had received that he was  thus  prevented the honour and advantage of either reading or listening to his compositions Do not however suppose that a traveller who has encountered so many more difficulties than Robinson Crusoe or Mr Bruce is to be dismayed by a few natural impediments in any of his auditory he goes on reciting with the most persevering vehemence and as in the above instance he fatigues you out of your welldissembled deafness he wearies you out of every  other  assumed misfortune by making you at least confess that though you  have  eyes you  will not see  and though you have ears you  will not hear  Thus you must either sacrifice your appetite to your politeness or your politeness to your appetite Mr Blank has written descriptions of countries through which he has never passed held discourses with the innabitants who never had habitation having first invented and then conversed with them painted sufferings with which it has not yet pleased the justice of God to reward his falsehood and incurred many hairbreadth escapes without his ever having been in danger  As it is however well observed that "nothing can come of nothing" I shall hasten to repay you for having made so "much ado" about it by the introduction of another traveller who will make his  entrè  under every circumstance that can contrast him to Mr Blank and whom therefore I shall call Mr Prize This gentleman comes recommended to your friendship by all the advantages of good sense heroism modesty and misfortune Mr Prize is one of the few who was shipwrecked in the South Seas in the Pandora frigate and he has been preserved from the general crush of his  fellow creatures by encountering difficulties from the furmounting which the residue of his life seems  entitled  to every honour and comfort his country can bestow But as in various other cases so in this his misfortunes have been productive of many interesting adventures amongst a people concerning whom public curiosity has been so much indebted to the immortal Captain Cooke Mr Prize with equal modesty and force related such a variety of anecdotes respecting the inhabitants of Otaheite that I passed from town to town in the public boats without perceiving the distances except to regret the stops in the narrative while we changed our barges though this at other times is a not unwelcome interruption I was earnest with him to extend the pleasure he had given me by publishing his account as a supplement to Cooke The modesty with which he declined this "because the task had been already better performed" was in perfect contrast to the literary or rather the illiterate arrogance with which Mr Blank had the day before roundly asserted in my hearing that  if he was ever again tempted to gratify the curiosity of an ungrateful world it should be well paid for  because added the vainglorious boaster  I cannot afford to throw  away my time and talents on a work which by annihilating all other travellers in the like route besides the traverse of unknown realms will throw a new light and lustre upon history  Nothing short of the pleasure one derives from the unaffected diffidence of a Mr Prize adorned with all the blushing powers of merit and of genius unconscious of those powers could atone for the disgusting pain one suffers from the swelling conceit of a Mr Blank who with the proudest opinions coupled the most impotent abilities for as the relation of Mr Prize was given in the simplest dress of Truth and Wisdom so was that of Mr Blank tricked off in all the meretricious ornaments of abortive labour panting after the eloquence it could not reach  Indeed I never but in one single instance knew uncommon talents united with undommon vanity and that one exception presented itself to my view the very next day after I had been regaled by the society of Mr Prize  That you may have these three extraordinary characters brought as close together upon paper  as they were in life you shall now have a gleaning of this third traveller whom if you please we will distinguish by the name of Blank and Prize  Mr BlankandPrize is a Swiss officer of distinction in the service of the Prince of Orange He unites the spirit of a soldier and the manners of a gentleman to the enthusiasm of a man of real genius That genius indeed like many of his natal mountains in Switzerland are sublime without sterility they flower to the very summits and like his natal vallies are rich and picturesque and "fling their fragrance" into the very bottom of the deepest glens He was introduced to me by a party of familiar friends who take pleasure in obliging me but having so lately suffered from the obtrusions of Mr Blank I did not expect a similar reparation to that which I had found in Mr Prize The first appearance of the man however was menacing He had not been announced a minute ere he was at the heels of his announcer I was introduced to him as a traveller a man of letters and an Englishman "I have a respect for all those characters" replied Mr BlankandPrize  I make my bow to them even when I meet  with them separately but when I see them combining before me in a single character and concentrating in one person as I understand is the case at present I open my arms to receive him in this manner  embracing  Here he expanded himself pulled me into his embraces and gave me the hug of literary brotherhood  I am myself a traveller a man of letters and though not an Englishman speak the language as you perceive as perfectly as the best educated native  continued Mr BlankandPrize  I have traversed three parts of the earth and am soon to set off for a tour of the other quarter I am by birth a Switzer glory in my country and hope and believe it will  glory in me  As he pronounced this a private of our author's regiment came in with a box of no inconsiderable size under his arm he placed it at his commanding officer's feet and making the  bow military  marched off in a drill step  Aye here are some of my works a short  specimen  sir said he" He took out the "key I trembled He threw open the lid "and brought forth as many folio sheets of  paper very closely penned as he could grasp With a no less determined hand he hurried out a second and then a third bundle threatening  such  an attack upon my patience and politeness as my submissive and often suffering nature almost sunk under and yet I would go and have many a time gone very far  indeed  to let every man and woman have their humour  The weather was extremely hot and illadapted to any very severe trials of attention I had ever an aversion to that class of authors who are  addicted  to read their own works and to be hedged into an enclosure where there is no room for any body  but  the author to move a foot or a finger perhaps for several hours together to the destruction of my dear sunsetting ramble or twilight stolen visit to nature or the moon with whom I have you know nightly assignations Did not all this threaten too much Had there been but a loophole left for apology I would have crept out at it But the meeting was concerted by my friends on purpose  pour me faire plaisir  purely to oblige me Martyrdom thought I  Having rapidly turned over about an hundred leaves Mr BlankandPrize said  still  turning  I see you are impatient for me to begin I will not keep you on the rack much longer Come then come I will have mercy on you You shall have a little of my account of Switzerland first then we will trip across the seas to America and then I will bring you back to Europe after which if we have time you shall inspect my book of maps and drawings Let me see we have six hours good and if I find you deeply interested as I am sure you will be I will strain a point to pass the whole evening at this house where I am always at home and where though I read my works twenty times they wish for them twenty more  Guess my situation A cat pent up in a corner never meditated more fell designs I could have stopp'd his cruel lips by cramming his own works  down his throat  A soliloquy broke out in something betwixt a grumble and a sigh How am I condemned to  hear  down the summer's day and night and make the tour of Europe and America chained down to this chair in such a day as this  Our historian began I anticipated periods of a mile and yawnings of a league I was  mistaken not only the genuine matter of the compositions but the manner in which they were delivered were treats Albeit I do not boast much of the supposed saturnine or phlegmatic characteristic of my countrymen and have possibly suffered not a little from indulging the bias of a contrary disposition I do assure you  my  most headlong sallies even when they have driven me from a plain path and open country into the entanglements of an untrodden wood in the which friend and reader thou hast often seen me involved might be deemed coldhearted apathy to the deportment of our literary hero while in the act of reading his manuscripts  He first took me into Switzerland and had he kept me there till now amidst the scenery with which his pen and pencil brought me acquainted I should have looked on myself as a very happy mountaineer and him as a delightful guide It is as impossible to read his book without wishing to visit his country and to possess the power to feel and to describe its beauties with the same force as to view the exquisite and magic scenery of De Loutherbourg  I cannot repeat the name of the lastmentioned gentleman without subscribing fully to your eulogium on his talents He paints to the soul "The cloudcapt hill" the profound valley the scarceheard rill the deafning cataract the proudest sublimities and all the interesting minutiae of nature in her labours in her pastimes in her awful operations and in her sports are before you  He places you on the spots described  His pencil carries you where its owner pleases you converse with the persons you lose sight of the painter you forget he is sitting in a chair beside you or even describing to you the story of his piece He is lost in the scene he has painted the objects he groupes the story he tells are in your heart He personifies imaginary and annihilates actual beings In short he interests you so much for the absent that you neglect or overlook the present For himself he is frequently out of sight and we have eyes and ears only for the places and personages with whom he has brought us acquainted but when the charm on the canvass is dissolved and De Loutherbourg comes again into view you recollect that he is not only one of the best painters but one of the worthiest men in the world This combines love of the man with  admiration of the artist and your satisfaction is complete  By a retrograde motion I shall now conduct you back to the  first  field of our observation in Holland Helvoetsluice in order to carry you progressively to the  last  to the advantage of your purse the ease of your person and the amusement of your mind  I should apologise for these Gleanings being somewhat out of place had it not been settled in a compact of correspondence between us to take what freedoms I pleased with time and circumstance to carry you backwards and forwards as seemed best unto me taking care to arrange the whole amidst this "regular confusion"  so  as to give you the greatest variety of entertainment and information  END OF VOL I  ERRATA VOL I  {inverted ⁂} As several of the following Errata
