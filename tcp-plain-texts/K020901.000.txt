 THE PLATONIC WIFE A COMEDY▪  As it is Performed at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  By a LADY  LONDON Printed for W JOHNSTON in Ludgatestreet J DODSLEY in PallMall and T DAVIES in Russelstreet MDCCLXV  TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF BEDFORD THIS PIECE IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED BY HER GRACE'S MUCH OBLIGED MOST GRATEFUL AND OBEDIENT SERVANT  The Author  ADVERTISEMENT  THE hint of this Piece was taken from one of the  Contes Moraux  of  Marmontel  stiled  L'Hereux Divorce  The foible ridiculed in the tale is perhaps the only one imputed to our sex which has never yet been exposed by a theatrical representation It is a simplicity not a coquetry it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind unacquainted with the manners of real life or the general frame of the human heart  The novel was too barren of incident to furnish out an entertainment for the stage which obliged me to contrive an intire underplot and introduce several new characters into the Comedy which I shall not take up the reader's time to point out here and submit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public after having perhaps too adventurously hazarded their criticism and censure  PROLOGUE  Sent by an unknown Hand  Enter at opposite doors  Serjeants POMPOUS  and  PLACID  pleaders in the court of Parnassus They look round the house  POMPOUS  HERE's a full court  PLACID  Come brother let's begin  POMPOUS  The judges are they seated  PLACID  Just gone in  POMPOUS  The jury  PLACID  Special freeholders in wit  POMPOUS  E comitatû lit'rator'm  the pit  So far so well Come now let's see the pannel  No pack'd one for the job I hope no  canaille  Placid  takes out a paper and reads  PLACID  The foreman Silence  POMPOUS  Good  PLACID  Sense Spirit Taste  And by their fellows you may guess the rest  Including Mercy which tho' last not least  Good men and true all sworn before Apollo  To hear the truth and nought but justice follow  POMPOUS  Know then my lords and gentlemen o'th' jury  We've found a bill i'th' records of old Drury  In which the culprit's charg'd in this here cause  With rankest treason against nature's laws  By introducing 'mong the scenes of life  A thing unheardof a  Platonic  Wife  Fair blooming and 'bout twentyfiveno more  I thought at least she had been sixtyfour  Here rests my plea In order to make good  The rights and properties of flesh and blood  For evidence upon yourselves I call  And set the cause on this to stand or fall  Have ye now one  Platonic  Wife among ye all  PLACID  My lords and gentlemen attend a while  Nor let too specious words your sense beguile  My brother's somewhat warm but  entre nous  Might not  Platonic  Wives suit some of you  Men fond of hunting drinking or  debate  Would they repine at a  Platonic  mate  Their hearts are aliened from domestic life  And hounds or wine or  party  are a wife  Besides he argues from the  common laws  But I in  equity  defend the cause  Plead women are not bound by Nature's rules  Nor are their morals borrow'd from the schools  How many sacrifice their youthful charms  To an old wealthy husband's feeble arms  Or yield to titles what they owe to merit  Wretched themselves that children may inherit  These sure are  Platonists  who thus forego  Nature's true joys for wealth or rank or shew  Our heroine tho' she differs wide from these  Has but refin'd upon the same disease  Our auth'ress too perhaps to aid her cause  May boast herself the great sublime she draws  By reason's standard then you judge amiss  Of those whose legislator is  caprice  I therefore  crave exception  for this night  And plead the  privilege  of Femaleright  POMPOUS  Well Sirs the case is stated proofs at hand  All ready here in court at your command  PLACID  Listen with candor as she merits treat her  POMPOUS  Freely condemn  PLACID  Or honourably acquit her  They bow and exeunt severally  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Lord FRANKLAND Mr POWELL  Sir WILLIAM BELVILLE Mr HOLLAND  Sir HARRY

discovered  CLARINDA  _I REJOICE to find that your ladyship's good nature is as much delighted as mine at lady Frankland's happy escape from the galling chain of matrimony  Lady FANSHAW  Why really Clarinda I look upon it that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being separated However there are my dear some material differences While the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound we never can forget we have been slaves There are besides some other disagreeable circumstances which attend a separation from which thank Heaven my state is free  CLARINDA  You mean I suppose the power a husband has of withdrawing alimony in case of indiscretion and forcing the wretched wife upon certain  moyens de vivre  whether she will or no  Lady FANSHAW  True Now you know that since that Gothic statute of the BlackRam in the Northwest Riding has been abolished we widows may chuse what hobbyhorse we please sometimes for variety perhaps an ass but oh defend me from a mule 'tis so vastly like a husband  CLARINDA  Oh the happiest simile in the world for on my conscience they seem equally to be deviations from the laws of nature However when broke from restiveness they are the best packsaddle amblers in the world  Lady FANSHAW  But now my dear Clarinda that we have got this pretty little bird out of its cage what think you will it do with its freedom 'Tis vastly wild and will I imagine take flight to some Arcadian grove and sit and sing alone  CLARINDA  O no that must not be it would disgrace our generalship She dies for sentimental passion and when once her romance is known I warrant we shall be able to supply her with pretenders enough who may assume by turns the crook and scrip the helmet and the lance to hold her in play Nay piqued as she was at what she stiled lord Frankland's indifference toward her I am persuaded that if one tender tear had but glistened in his eye at the instant of their separation she would have sunk into his arms and like the plaintive turtle have  moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life in true conjugal insipidity  Lady FANSHAW  I am surprized this did not happen for I am quite of opinion that lord Frankland loves her  CLARINDA  He certainly does but then he did not deify her My lord knows himself to be a mere mortal man and has not the presumption of lxion to cope with goddesses  Lady FANSHAW  He once I think admired you Clarinda it was thought you liked him too how happened you to escape the noose  CLARINDA  Platonics lady Fanshaw all Platonics So vulgar a notion as matrimony never once I believe entered either of our heads and I dare swear he wishes now that he had never changed his mind since in that article  Lady FANSHAW  'Tis possible he may and that at length tired with the pettishness of a spoiled child he may return and throw his devoirs again at the feet of one who will at least treat him like a reasonable creature  CLARINDA  I dare not indulge the hope but I shall endeavour though to lay every obstacle in the way to their reunion Lady Frankland is young and handsome she may be virtuous too but how long that same fortress called Chastity will hold out when besieged by flattery the love of which is her chief foible I cannot say  Lady FANSHAW  Why just as long Clarinda as any other fortress where the governor loves money and the besiegers come up to his price But among those who either are or pretend to be her adorers I cannot yet perceive that she has shewn the smallest preference and I really believe that she admires Alexander Cyrus or Orondates more than any man alive  CLARINDA  Perhaps she may think so too but be assured lady Fanshaw that any person who ardently desires to inspire a  romantic  passion is not unsusceptible of a  natural  one and when that takes place she will e'en act an old proverb and accept of the  living dog  instead of the  dead lion  Lady FANSHAW  But come my dear Clarinda and let us attend the levee of this eccentric comet which like other blazing stars perhaps glitters but to fall  Exeunt  SCENE II  A dressingroom  Lord FRANKLAND  gazing on a female picture  Lord FRANKLAND  Thou beauteous shade of that angelic form whose wild caprices have destroyed my peace I could for ever gaze upon thee As lord Townly says "Why did I marry" Oh rather say Why did I quit my charge deputed as I was her virtue's guard  Enter  Mr FRANKLAND  Mr FRANKLAND  Good morning to your lordship  Lord FRANKLAND  Good morrow Charles  Mr FRANKLAND  I grieve to find your lordship's contemplations still fixed upon that gloomy subject  Lord FRANKLAND  And wherefore should they not Why gloomy Charles Look with what innocence she smiles upon me and sure that painting is the portrait of her heart  Mr FRANKLAND  I have not the least doubt of lady Frankland's innocence or virtue but surely my lord it were a childish folly to cast our plaything from us then sit and mourn its loss  Lord FRANKLAND  I have not done so Charles I have thrown a diamond in a flaming furnace if it escape without a crack or flaw its value then is proved  Mr FRANKLAND  Ay if it does my lord  Lord FRANKLAND  Why should you doubt it Charles I know her merits and her foibles tooher real love of virtue with her fond wishes to inspire a vain romantic passion  Mr FRANKLAND  And can you think my lord that to obtain so fair so rich a prize there are not men who will assume the semblance of a more romantic passion than even your lordship feels  Lord FRANKLAND  Perdition's in that thought Oh Charles had I but shewn the thousandth part of that fond love I feel for lady Frankland this fatal separation ne'er had happened  Enter  AMBROSE  AMBROSE  I have been my lord to inquire lady Frankland's health and was answered by her woman that her ladyship had sat up late reading a new romance that she had wept much and slept little but was in tolerable health this morning  Lord FRANKLAND  May each new morn fresh from its downy wings shed health and happiness around her Order my chariot Ambrose and see that all things are got ready for my departure this morning I shall go to Belleveüe for how long I know not Perhaps air exercise and change of objects may throw off this sad weight  Exit  Ambrose  Mr FRANKLAND  Shall I accompany your lordship  Lord FRANKLAND  No Charles you seem to have some doubts of lady Frankland's conduct I would have you therefore be a witness to it for my part I have none Your intimacy with Emilia who now lives with my wife will furnish you with sufficient opportunities to know every step she takes and I shall thank you with true gratitude to deal with strictest justice  Exit  Mr FRANKLAND  Ay toward myself I will This poor weak man has parted from his wife for wishing he should love her and now sits pining at yon babyface and longs to have the limbs to it again But should that happen he may perhaps get others which must contract and cripple mine Counsellor Frankland with four hundred pounds ayear and that dipt up to the chin too is but a poor lover sor Emilia with  fifteen hundred but the same man heir to lord Frankland's rank and fortune sounds well enough Therefore the case stands thus my bird is almost caught and shall I loose the string and let it fly to lure his to the nest again where it may sit and breed while I am whistled down the wind to prey at fortune  Exit  SCENE III  An antichamber in  Lady Frankland  's house  Enter  FONTANGE  FONTANGE  Nicodumpus Nicodumpus maka de hot vater for my lady breakfast Vite Nicodumpus  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  What can she mean now  FONTANGE  Why

sorry lean spectacles to take the bread out of our English  mouths and then prate to us in outlandish gibberish of ruelly's villy's and Cato's But I'll be hanged if Mrs Cato that lived with my lady

mademoiselle you seem to be in a most piteous taking For goodness sake Nicodemus what have you done to poor mademoiselle  NICODEMUS  Why nothing at all Mrs Lucy and Ise sorry for it Those damned furbeloes and flounces about her heels there have saved her beacon or I'd have trimmed her jacket for her ay that I would  FONTANGE  Oh he has mada de baddest names of mehe calla me de spectacle de

nerves seem mightily affected and I have got some excellent hartshorn which I hope will compose you  FONTANGE  Oh de béte de monster  Exeunt  SCENE IV  Discovers  Lady FRANKLAND  at her toilet reading  Lady FRANKLAND  Where thought meets thought ere from the lips they part  And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart  This sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be  Heigh ho why cannot I repeat the rest Dear unhappy Eloise but oh far more unhappy lady Frankland She had experienced those transports she so feelingly describes whilst I unhappy I with all the tenderness of fond affections glowing in my breast was doomed to the embraces of a marble statue Surely my glass deceives me or I might well inspire that ardent love which lifts us to the skies upon its seraph's wings Cruel parents was it for you I wedded you chose indeed a man of worth and honour for me O the rare gift but to become once weary of a faultless person is to be doomed to lassitude for life This surely is severe  Enter  EMILIA  EMILIA  Upon my word lady Frankland you will spoil those fine eyes of yours with constant poring and then I fear you will become so very very wise too that our beaux won't be able to converse with you and we shall absolutely be deserted by every creature but the grave Sir William Belville who I believe reads a little and the sagacious counsellor Frankland learned in the laws  Lady FRANKLAND  I assure you Emilia I almost wish I had never learned my letters sor the delicate and refined sentiments which books have inspired me with have only served to disgust me with almost all mankind  EMILIA  And yet you would have me read and sigh and weep over a parcel of doleful devils who ten to one never existed nor is it a farthing matter whether they did or no Not I truly if knowledge is to make me unhappy I am sure 'tis wisdom to remain in ignorance and I heartily wish dame Eve had thought so too  Lady FRANKLAND  Yet you lose vast pleasure Emilia  EMILIA  Grant it you must allow that I escape much pain And I am persuaded that your ladyship might have been as happy with lord Frankland as any woman in England if your ideas had not been perverted and disturbed by an heap of vile romantic trash  Lady FRANKLAND  No Emilia it was impossible But let me not accuse my lord for this my ill stars only were to blame  EMILIA  Bless me what had stars to do in that caseunless you mean stars and garters and I dare say his lordship might easily have obtained a red ribbon at least if that could have rendered you happy  Lady FRANKLAND  My dear wild girl you have wandered very far from my meaning When I accused my fate in order to excuse my lord it was for not having afforded me some glorious opportunity of manifesting a passion for him by some noble generous deed which must have extorted his admiration his gratitude and love For to deal candidly what right had I to have expected that lord Frankland should be a passionate lover what sacrifice had I made him by what heroic devotement had I awakened the sensibility of his soul where was the merit of having obeyed my parents and accepted for an husband one to whom I could possibly have no exception  EMILIA  Indeed my dear lady Frankland you talk strangely and put me in mind of a young lady of my acquaintance deeply versed in romance who with a  large fortune ran away with an ensign but when they had got clear off she would not be content unless he returned and suffered her to leap out of a window to him The experiment was made and the poor lady discovered and confined till a more suitable match could be found out for her  Lady FRANKLAND  With which I suppose she was miserable for life Why should love meddle in matches of convenience Oh ye delights of sensible souls charms of impassioned hearts where are ye alas in free and independent love alone in the mutual yielding of two fond hearts which have bestowed themselves  EMILIA  Oh for Heaven's sake dear lady Frankland don't run on at this rate I vow I am frightened lest you should tempt me to throw away myself and fortune upon some beggar in pursuit of these same transports which after all I do not believe are to be found any where but in the heated imagination of some poet or romancemonger  Lady FRANKLAND  I hope that my dear Emilia will experience every happiness which she can wish I own your reproof is just and I shall henceforth avoid any discourse that may elevate your notions to such an height as may perhaps make you feel those bitter pangs of disappointment which have been my lot  EMILIA  My dear lady Frankland I had not the least idea of your growing serious on the subject But luckily here comes company to divert it I have some letters to write and shall return the moment they are finished  Exit  Enter  Lady FANSHAW CLARINDA  and  Sir HARRY WILMOT  Lady FANSHAW  Joy to my dear lady Frankland joy to the world of love and gaity  CLARINDA  Joy to the lovers of liberty that you have recovered yours  Lady FRANKLAND  I thank ye ladies for your congratulations but as yet I confess I do not see of what great advantage this same boasted liberty will be of to me I have really no pursuits to follow no inclinations to indulge that need restraint and to become one's own mistress at my age is I think a thing rather to be feared than wished  Sir HARRY  Why truly madam yours is a critical situation But what is  female  liberty after all but a name for a fine woman can never enjoy it but in the moment she renounces it and it is only worth preserving in order to part with it to good purpose  Lady FANSHAW  I am astonished Sir Harry to hear you preach such absurd doctrine Lady Frankland is very young her ignorance is therefore pardonable but give me leave who have been my own mistress these ten years to instruct her ladyship in the charms and use of liberty and I fancy she will find there is something in them more than  a name  Sir HARRY  Madam I bow to your superior judgment and must confess I do not know a more experienced guide to all the paths of pleasure You and the gay Clarinda here would have made notable priestesses  were the mysteries of the  Bona Dea  now in vogue But madam  to lady Frankland  I would not have your ladyship discouraged by what I have said with regard to liberty for 'tis doubtless a most delightful thing to be free  Lady FANSHAW  True Sir Harry provided one knows how to use that freedom but to run gadding about the world without meaning or design is certainly a gross abuse of it  Sir HARRY  Absolute prostitution of our greatest blessingBut in my opinion there is but one measure for your ladyship to pursue to chuse a proper conductor and leave the rest to him A person endowed with your ladyship's beauty and delicacy of sentiment must surely have the choice of many  Bowing affectedly to her  Lady FRANKLAND  There lies the difficulty Sir Harry When they who wished my happiness as ardently as I can do whose judgment and experience were far superior to mine have erred what have I not to fear even in the choice of a mere sentimental friendship which is all my situation can admit of  Sir HARRY  Your ladyship means I suppose in chusing lord Frankland for your husband  CLARINDA  I swear for my part I ever thought it an illsuited match  Sir HARRY  Why he is really a good sort of man and sensible enough too but unhappily wants taste not at all cut out for discovering the elegant and refined charms of your ladyship's mind Besides  really the desire of pleasing an husband is in general so very languid that a fine woman seldom exerts her most amiable qualities toward him To charm to conquer she reserves for other eyes and other hearts than his  Lady FRANKLAND  Indeed Sir Harry I should look upon myself as highly culpable if that had been my case My utmost wish was to inspire lord Frankland with the most delicate passion How I have failed I know not  Lady FANSHAW  Oh the sweet plaintive turtle Come come my dear lord Frankland is a reasonable creature he leaves you at liberty  Sir HARRY  And you would be unworthy of such rational treatment should you squander so great a treasure in idleness or dissipation  Lady FRANKLAND  I am not much afraid of falling into either of these extremes Sir Harry  Enter  EMILIA  EMILIA  Was there ever so rude a monster as that Charles Frankland I met him in the antechamber and made him as civil a curtesy as any third cousin could possibly do and the bear came up to me whipt me about the neck and kissed me with the same rustic freedom he used to do at my father's in Wales when he came circuit with the judges and dined at our house  CLARINDA  Oh poor Emilia ha ha ha  EMILIA  Do settle my tucker Clarinda  Enter  Mr FRANKLAND  So Sir you have followed me I see  Mr FRANKLAND  He must be a dull hound indeed who could be found at a fault in so short a course I am glad to see your ladyship  to lady Frankland  Sir HARRY  I find your ladyship so much engaged with the croud which surrounds you that I shall for the present take my leave but as I have something of importance to communicate to you I intreat you will allow me the honour of waiting on you this evening when the company may be seated at cards and I may have the felicity of entertaining your ladyship apart  Lady FRANKLAND  I shall be glad to see you Sir Harry  Exit  Sir Harry  Mr FRANKLAND  I doubt it not  aside  Lady FRANKLAND  Well now my dear giddy Emilia what is this terrible disaster which you complain of  Mr FRANKLAND  Why madam all I know of the matter is that my cousin seems offended at my being glad to see her  EMILIA  Not so neither Mr Charles but you need not drag one's cloaths off as you used to do Besides I am not so great a romp as I was and had not my hair dressed then I am sure he has disconcerted it mightily has not he lady Fanshaw  Lady FANSHAW  Not much my dear  Lady FRANKLAND  This fracas will soon be made up I imagine Mr Frankland you'll do me the pleasure of your company to dinner Come ladies  Mr FRANKLAND  I shall attend your ladyship  Exeunt all but  Mr  Frankland An assignation so publicly made I think I never saw it almost wears the face of innocence from indiscretion This is a rare place to seek a wife in I think I had better play Sir Harry's game and look out for an intrigue Ay surely were it the woman only that I sought but in that case the fortune is as transferable as the lass and I would not give sixpence for the latter without the former▪  Exit  End of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Lady Frankland  's house  Mr FRANKLAND  and  EMILIA  EMILIA  WELL Mr Frankland now that you have drawn me from the company prithee what is this mighty important business you said you had to communicate to me  Mr FRANKLAND  How can my dear Emilia be so coldask such a cruel question  EMILIA  I declare I am not in the least cold I think the weather rather warm for the season and as to cruelty 'tis a most unjust charge for I vow I never hurt any thing in my life no not a fly  Mr FRANKLAND  How can you trifle thus  EMILIA  Nay but it is you that trifle and I beg you will not detain me for I am sure the company within will sit down to loo in five minutes and I would not lose my place at the table for any consideration therefore if you have any thing to say speak  vite vite  as Fontange says  Mr FRANKLAND  Since I find madam that you cannot with patience spare a few minutes to one whose every hour of life is devoted to you I shall not trespass on you longer but leave you madam to more agreeable avocations  Going  EMILIA  No I swear you shall not make a fool of me neither I am sure lady Frankland will ask what business you had with me therefore do pray do tell it me directly  Mr FRANKLAND  If my eyes have not already made the too presumptuous declaration then let my tongue avow itEmilia I adore you  EMILIA  Ha ha ha and is that the mighty secret labouring in your breastWhy my good cousin Charles you ought certainly to be a great wit for you really have a very bad memory and seem utterly to forget that you have told me the same story by night and by day an hundred times at least within these three years and that I have always received this pompous declaration just as I do at presentHa ha ha  Mr FRANKLAND  I am extremely unhappy madam to find that the most important concern of my life should become a matter of ridicule and mirth to you But though you cannot feel for others let your own danger awaken your sensibility You stand at present on the brink of ruin and have no other place of safety that I can see but these arms to take refuge in  EMILIA  Then sure my case is desperate indeed But what danger Sir what ruin am I threatened with  Mr FRANKLAND  With one of the greatest misfortunes that can possibly befal an innocent young womanthe loss of reputation madam  EMILIA  My character Sir is far above the reach of malice nor has the tongue of slander ever yet pronounced my name  Mr FRANKLAND  It will not long be silent then be assured of it associated as you now are with persons whose characters have been so long infamous that scandal has forgot their names  EMILIA  I neither know nor own such vile acquaintance but if you would not have me think you worse far worse than those you have described speak out directly name them to me Sir nor like a base assassin attempt to wound those by night you dare not look upon by day  Mr FRANKLAND  My dear Emilia you are young and do not see through the artifices of that vile woman  EMILIA  What woman Sure you dare not hint it  Mr FRANKLAND  Lady Frankland is  EMILIA  An angel  Mr FRANKLAND  I say a fallen one  EMILIA  Oh thou art one and of the blackest dyeShe vile she artful thou art a monster but to think it Her mind and person are as pure as mountainsnow which the sun's beams have never glanced upon  Mr FRANKLAND  This is prodigious fine very poetical truly But now my dear Emilia  taking her hand  EMILIA  Stand off there's poison in your touch as in your speech  Mr FRANKLAND  Are you then deaf as well as blind Were you not present this morning when she publicly gave an assignation to Sir Harry Wilmot her bedchamber I suppose will be the scene  EMILIA  Sir I command you silence let not your venomed tongue offend my ears with such base such vile suggestions  Mr FRANKLAND  You bid me speak and you shall hear me out Is not the grave Sir William Belville ever sighing at her feet with twenty coxcombs more who in their turns shall hope nor hope in vain  EMILIA  Leave me Sir I desire you'll leave me  Mr FRANKLAND  No my lovely Emilia I cannot will not leave you I will defend you even against yourself I have shewn you the precipice on which you stand let me now point out the path to happiness and safety This vile lady Frankland  EMILIA  Again Sir  Mr FRANKLAND  Can never think of returning back to her husband again and in failure of lawful issue you know I am his heir therefore no despicable match for my Emilia  EMILIA  Thou art indeed the most despicable meanest wretch that lives So sir the source of this polluted stream at length appears You have traduced  one innocent woman to entrap another But know that were you this moment what I hope you never will be in possession of lord Frankland's wealth and honours and that Emilia had not a shilling in the world she would fly you with the same detestation and contempt she does at present And so my lord Wouldbe adieu  Exit  Mr FRANKLAND  I fear I have overshot the mark I thought to have frightened the little Welch puss with the cry of scandal opening against her and that she would have taken cover in my arms But faith she is a stout one and worth scampering after the whole circumference of her estate and by fair or foul means I will yet hunt her down  Enter  FONTANGE  Serviteur mademoiselle  FONTANGE  Oh your honour's tres humble servante comment se porte Mr Padrick your honour's Iris serviteur he never a come to see us since a we leave Parliamentarystreet Oh he be de inconstant varlet  Mr FRANKLAND  I shall take care to chide him for it mademoiselle and send him to wait upon you directly  FONTANGE  Oh your honour maka me very very glad I do like Mr Padrick dearly he be so very coxcomical he maka me laugh and then he maka de plays vid de kisses in it Oh it was very very sweet  Mr FRANKLAND  Well mademoiselle Patrick shall certainly refresh your lips with some of those sweet kisses  again But tell me how do you like your manner of living since your removal to PallMall I suppose you are quite happy here without a master  FONTANGE  Oh point de tout not at all My lady she keep a de very bad hour pauvre Fontange she must sit up for her lady I am sure me look a de vizard for want of de sleep  Mr FRANKLAND  How happens that mademoiselle what can she find to do alone  FONTANGE  Why she have a de companie dat stay with her sometime till one or two o'clok den she go up to her chambre dere she sit down to sigh or to read a de great big boke den may be that laughing miss Emilie she come in whip away de boke and sit prateaprate to her till we no want candle to go to bed But I beg a your honour's pardon I have a de lettre to my lady from Sir Harry Wilmot  Mr FRANKLAND  Serviteur mademoiselle Proceed in your vocation  FONTANGE  Your tres humblePray souvenez monsieur Padrick  Exit  Mr FRANKLAND  A letter from Sir Harry What then his stomach does not serve or perhaps he thinks the treat will keep cold I am sorry for it I wish he or the Devil had her I know not what to think of her I greatly fear she may be honest But if I can contrive any method to ruin her in lord Frankland's opinion 'tis quite equal and she may then remain as chaste as she pleases for me This French  woman may be of use She certainly knows her lady's secrets and it will be very extraordinary if an Englishman's gold and an Irishman's kisses may not be able to open the lock of that curious repository She may assist in my design on Emilia too whom I am determined to have were it only to gratify my pique  Exit  SCENE II  A drawingroom in  Lady Frankland  's house  Lady FRANKLAND Lady FANSHAW CLARINDA  and  Sir WILLIAM BELVILLE  seated at a cardtable  Lady FRANKLAND  The pool is out and my cards are really so disagreeable that I am tired of playing I wish Emilia would come and take them  Enter  EMILIA  Will you play Emilia  EMILIA  No madam I would rather be excused at present  Sir WILLIAM  Then we have done if your ladyship pleases and I am glad of it for I confess I think that play among friends is a most shameful misemployment of time and that cards appear properly in the hands of sharpers only merely as implements of their trade  CLARINDA  For all that Sir William cards are a very comfortable resource sometimes  EMILIA  Ay where the company is not large enough to make up a countrydance  Lady FANSHAW  I am sure half the people of fashion in England would pass many a dull evening nay perhaps some of them might hang or drown themselves if it was not for the relief which these little innocent paintings afford  Lady FRANKLAND  I am so far of Sir William Belville's opinion that I think avarice is the true source of play and how persons of liberal minds and easy fortunes can reconcile so mean a motive to themselves is to me surprizing  Sir WILLIAM  There are few people madam who are truly acquainted with the springs of their own actions and many who are actuated by the basest would be shocked if they knew them  Lady FRANKLAND  This is a grave subject Sir William I think we grow rather too wise  EMILIA  Why I really think so too so I'll e'en go trifle O Clarinda such a capuchin as I saw in the Park yesterday I will have just such another positively and will instantly go enter into close consultation with my milliner on this important subject  Exit  Lady FANSHAW  I wish Sir Harry Wilmot was here he would enliven us all even without cards  CLARINDA  You'll not have your wish tonight lady FanshawSir Harry is engaged  Lady FANSHAW  Prithee where Clarinda  CLARINDA  At lady Subtle's He is solely devoted to her for the present Her husband is in the country  and I dare say he would not spend this evening from her for a nabob's fortune  Lady FANSHAW  Ridiculous how can you talk so why he has been in her good graces above this month which is long enough believe me to surfeit him He has had a dozen amours at least within these twelve months  Lady FRANKLAND  A dozen did you say lady Fanshaw  Lady FANSHAW  I did indeed and your ladyship may be assured I have spoken within bounds  CLARINDA  I dare say so too and yet he has behaved with honour to them all  Lady FRANKLAND  How you amaze me with honour said you I thought till now that constancy in love had been a virtue  Lady FANSHAW  I have met with some such musty moral among the metaphysics of old romances but the  bon ton  of later times have exploded it long since I assure your ladyship  Enter  FONTANGE  FONTANGE  I humbly beg a mille pardon of your ladyship and of all de ladyships for me entre here but I have a beg of Nicodumpus this halfhour to bring a this lettre to your ladyship but he pretend a he do not entendez moi and I am forced to bring it myself for which I beg a mille pardon again  Lady FRANKLAND  Give it to me mademoiselleI shall return immediately  Exit  Lady Frankland  and  Fontange  Sir WILLIAM  Looking after  Lady Frankland  Each word each glance discovers some new charm And dead not cold is he she cannot warm  Lady FANSHAW  O fye Sir William what a mere whining inamorato you are why don't you say all these fine things to her face what signifies your sighing them out after she has got beyond earshot  Sir WILLIAM  The delicate and high respect I bear toward her ladyship's unhappy situation must seal my lips in everlasting silence nor shall I ever breathe a sigh or wish that may offend her  Lady FANSHAW and CLARINDA  Ha ha ha  CLARINDA  And so you think she would be offended Lord Sir William though you are very young you need not pretend to be quite so innocent Offended ha ha ha  Enter  Lady FRANKLAND  Lady FRANKLAND  I am pleased to hear you so merry ladies Prithee communicate the occasion for I should be glad to try if there be sympathy in mirth as well as contagion in sorrow Do tell me what you laugh at  Sir WILLIAM  Lady Fanshaw and Clarinda madam were saying  Lady FRANKLAND  What pray  Lady FANSHAW  Why that of all simple animals a bashful lover was the most ridiculous  Lady FRANKLAND  I believe there are few men nowadays ridiculous on that account I have indeed read of lovers who have sighed whole years away without daring to acquaint the happy object with their passion  CLARINDA  While perhaps the pining fair one sat sighing in her turn to waving woods and purling streams for him again Ha ha ha  Lady FRANKLAND  That too might have happened I believe Clarinda  Lady FANSHAW  And don't your ladyship think they were a couple of mighty silly mortals  Lady FRANKLAND  You know my sentiments upon that subject already ladies  Sir WILLIAM  For my part I think there is happiness sufficient in the bare loving of an amiable object  CLARINDA  What without any hope or desire of a return  Sir WILLIAM  It is impossible to divest a lover of the fond hope of being pitied at least by the object he adores and while he confines his wishes within that bound he is indeed a lover but when he vainly thinks his services should merit a reward perhaps inconsistent with the honour or happiness of the beloved object selflove assumes the place of passion and it no longer deserves even the name  Lady FRANKLAND  Upon my word Sir William I am charmed with the elegant and just description you have given of  love and am rejoiced to find the dear idea still exists in any breast besides my own  Sir WILLIAM  They must be insensible indeed who could have had the happiness of conversing with your ladyship without being in some degree inspired by that delicacy and refinement which accompany all your words and actions and if I have been able to conceive or express proper sentiments of the noblest passion I own myself indebted for them to my knowledge of lady Frankland  Lady FANSHAW  Aside to  Clarinda  This goes on swimmingly let us leave them together I dare say they wish us gone Clarinda  To  Lady Frankland  We must bid your ladyship good evening Clarinda and I are under an engagement to meet lady Rattle and some other company at Vauxhall  Sir William  bows to  Lady Frankland  at the same time as taking leave  CLARINDA  You are not coming with us Sir William  Sir WILLIAM  No madam but I think it time also to retire I wish your ladyship goodnight  CLARINDA  Stupid fellow I would not have gone away these two hours if I had thought so  Aside  Exeunt all but  Lady Frankland  Lady FRANKLAND  Sir William Belville is really a very agreeable and polite man Oh if lord Frankland had been capable of his refined his delicate sentiments of love how happy had I been this were indeed the golden age again restored to meBut let me see once more what says the gay Sir Harry  Takes out a letter and reads  "Madam  "I am totally in despair at losing the most precious moments of my life but company have broke in upon me and prevented my laying my devoirs at your feet What would I not give to escape from them but unluckily they are persons of the first conditionI cannot therefore taste of happiness till tomorrow I most earnestly conjure dear lady Frankland to abridge some hours of cruel and distracting absence by permitting me to attend her levee at the toilet 'Till then I have the honour to be  Her ladyship's most passionate adorer  H WILMOT"  Vain coxcomb is this then the important business he had to communicate to me But I will see him to mortify the insolence of his presumption  Enter  EMILIA  EMILIA  Pray what is your ladyship ruminating so very seriously upon  Lady FRANKLAND  I have much to think of Emilia but I promised you this morning you may remember to confine my ideas to my own breast I fancy you look grave too what has Mr Frankland boisterously presumed to kiss your hand or neglected to take up your fan when you dropt it on purpose for him or  EMILIA  No such matters I assure your ladyship Yet he has indeed furnished me with a very copious subject for contemplation But  Lady FRANKLAND  I claim no right over your secrets my dear and from the good opinion I have formed of your character  I dare say you may be safely trusted with the keeping of them yourself But as I most sincerely wish your happiness I must say that I think you would have a better chance for it with any other man than Mr Frankland There is a reserve even in his gayest manners that seems to squint suspicion  EMILIA  I am so far of your ladyship's opinion that I promise you Mr Frankland shall never have it in his power to render me unhappy But let us talk no more upon so disagreeable a subject I have just got the last new song that your ladyship seemed fond of will you step into the next room and hear it with the harpsichord  Lady FRANKLAND  With all my heart  Exeunt  SCENE III  Mr Frankland  's chambers in the Temple  Mr FRANKLAND  musing Enter  PATRICK  with a letter  Mr FRANKLAND  You have staid a confounded while but I suppose you waited for an answerGive it to me  PATRICK  Fait and if I had done that myself would not have been here so soon itself for how could miss Emilia give an answer to a letter she would not read unless she was a conjuror or a witch  Mr FRANKLAND  Not read my letter  PATRICK  Not she indeed she scorned the motion though mademoiselle palavered her at the greatest rate and said she was sure it must be very pretty when it  would come from the young concealor but madam Emilia she said she would not pry into the concealment that is she would not break the seal I suppose Augh she is very witty  Mr FRANKLAND  Leave your nonsensical prate and be gone  PATRICK  Well there is your letter for you again safe and sound not a bit worse than when you gave it meO yes fait it has got a little clean dirt in my pocket but that's no great signify it will serve a poor body well enough still Shall I carry it to Mrs Susan Taper in Threadneedlestreet may be it would bid her bring home the shirts if she is able to carry them with the load your honour has given her already  Mr FRANKLAND  Blockhead give me the letter  Takes and tears it  PATRICK  Fait that's very foolish now I am sure your honour was a full hour a writing it and what do you throw it away for  Mr FRANKLAND  Leave the room  Exit  Patrick  The insolence of this proud girl distracts me I fear I am on the brink of ruin my fortune mortgaged for more than it is worth my honour pawned at play and what is worse my credit sunk with her who was to have redeemed them all should she acquaint lord Frankland with what I have said of his wife his foolish fondness for her honour may make him cast me off both from his heart and fortune Beggary contempt and infamy stare in my face I must find out some means to avoid their frowns or else escape from them by the help of a pistol but as that is at any time in my power I'll make one effort more before I draw the trigger and deserve death at least before I fly to it  End of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  Lord FRANKLAND  's dressingroom  Enter  Lord FRANKLAND  reading  TO climates chear'd by other suns  In vain the wretched exile runs  Or tho' he mount the rapid steed  Care follows with unerring speed  How strongly do I feel the force of this sentiment in my own breast I hoped the opening charms of the soft breathing spring would have removed my languor I grew sick of the country in a few hours and I shall probably be tired of London in as short a space  Enter  AMBROSE  AMBROSE  I hope I see your lordship in good health your sudden return has alarmed me  Lord FRANKLAND  I thank you Ambrose but I am as well as ever I expect to be  AMBROSE  My dearest lord you break my heart to hear you talk so sadly If your old servant guesses right your malady is loveLove for the sweetest best of women your lordship's wife Oh she is all made up of gentleness and generosity I wonder indeed I do how you could have the heart to part with her indeed I do my lord  Lord FRANKLAND  Full well I know her exquisite perfections Ambrose and admire them all But with a heart that lov'd as mine did how could I bear daily to be reproached with want of tenderness and passion for her I found it impossible to act up to her romantic notions and as I could not make her happy I determined not to make her wretched tho' 'tis too sure that she has rendered me so  AMBROSE  I am certain my lord her gentle heart would break if she suspected that you grieved for her She ever has received your poor old servant with the greatest kindness and made me even sit down before her when she thought that I looked feeble or fatigued while she inquired minutely of your lordship's health Then let me go to her and tell her what I am sure your lordship thinks I know she will hear me indeed she willOh on my knees I beg that I may be the blessed messenger of peace the happy cause of your reunion  Lord FRANKLAND  I command you not to attempt it The pride of manhood and of love forbid it could I have condescended to have whined and sighed before her we never should have parted but since that has happened nothing but a full conviction of the injury she has done my love shall ever make us meet again Mean time I will watch over her like her guardian angel and shield her from each wrong or violence she brings not on herself Should that e'er happen my care is at an end  Aside  Go Ambrose and inquire her health and let Emilia know I should be glad to see her But for your life breathe not a syllable of what has past  AMBROSE  I will obey your lordship tho' 'tis the first severe command you ever laid upon me  Lord FRANKLAND  You will find me in the library  Exeunt  severally  SCENE II  Lady FRANKLAND  's dressingroom  Lady Frankland  just risen from dressing  Fontange  settling the toilet  Enter  Sir HARRY and  exit  FONTANGE  Sir HARRY  Bright as the sun and as the morning fair Eh ma charmante what an amazing freshness of complexion what a profusion of lovely hair upon my soul lady Frankland you are vastly handsome  Lady FRANKLAND  I am glad to see you in such top spirits Sir Harry I suppose them the effect of your last night's party  Sir HARRY  Last nightLet me consider where was I last night Oh the cursed embarras du monde which prevented my waiting on your ladyship I have a vast mind to turn shepherd and renounce the world at once Should not you like to be a shepherdess now  Lady FRANKLAND  O vastly with such a faithful swain  Sir HARRY  Egad and so I am Constancy is I think my greatest foible at present'Tis apt to wear out a mistress's patience  Lady FRANKLAND  Then lady Subtle may boast of her charms if they have been powerful enough to six the lively roving Sir Harry Wilmot  Sir HARRY  Lady Subtle why you know ma chere her charms are in the wane absolutely expiringWe have been old acquaintance and it would have been cruel in me to have refused her the shadow of an amour when she is so very near becoming a ghost I am glad to find she is jealous  Aside  Lady FRANKLAND  Is she in a bad state of health Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  O by no means she is as fat and florid as any woman in England of her age which I believe is near forty  Lady FRANKLAND  Pray where is the danger then of her becoming a ghost  Sir HARRY  Helas ma chere innocente don't you meet a thousand ghosts in every public place Bodies without souls who have haunted the world so long that they are worn out of every one's remembrance and might glide in and out without ever being taken notice of if it were not for the space they occupy Have you never been jostled by a fat red ghost in the box lobby of the playhouse  or at the puppetshow cascade at Vauxhall ha ha ha  Lady FRANKLAND  As they differ in every respect from spirits I should never have thought of stiling them ghosts tho' as you have explained it I own the term is apt enough yet I fancy that  blanks  would do still better as some authors have lately used them merely to make up bulk and stuff life's volume  Sir HARRY  I vow madam your ladyship has an infinity of wit as well as beauty But now prithee dear lady Frankland what do you seriously mean to do with them both  Lady FRANKLAND  I do not find myself overburthen'd with either of those rare qualities Sir Harry but if I should I must e'en look out for some goodnatured person who will be kind enough to assist me in bearing the load  Sir HARRY  Ay now your ladyship talks reason Mutual offices are the very bands of society And among the croud of adorers who bow before your shrine have you yet fixed on one whom you think equal to so blest a charge I may be impertinentYour ladyship's blushes seem to hint as much  Lady FRANKLAND  No Sir Harry a heart like mine has nothing to disguiseIf I blushed it was not shame but pride that glowed upon my cheek from the slight notion you seem to have conceived of me that among the trifling characters which frequent my drawing room there could be found one capable of attaching my confidence or regards  Sir HARRY  Why that is vastly severe now when there are such a number of pretty fellows who dedicate their services to your ladyship What pains she takes to shew me she is not engaged  Aside  Lady FRANKLAND  It would be the height of vanity in me to set down their visits to my own account Sir Harry while I am blest with a companion in my house whose mind is free and person disengag'd and where each charm that can attract in both unite in my Emilia  Sir HARRY  Faith I have always heard your ladyship reckoned a little romantic but never believed it till now Emilia why we know her price is matrimony to become a property for life egad And sure no man of spirit would condescend to such terms unless with a view to lord Frankland's circumstances madam  Lady FRANKLAND  Sir you grow insolent  Sir HARRY  I vow I did not mean it and ask a thousand pardonsbut surely madam with that blaze that glow of youth and beauty which surrounds you it is impossible you should think of living disengag'd Were the Hesperian fruit planted in our streets it would require ten dragons to secure it Alas you have not one  Lady FRANKLAND  In this imminent danger what think you of my appointing such an excellent guardian as Sir Harry Wilmot ha ha ha  Sir HARRY  You may gibe if you please madam but I certainly should be the very thing if I were not so much engag'd Lord what shall I do for means to get free  Lady FRANKLAND  Pray do not give yourself the least trouble upon that account Sir Harry for tho' I am as you observed  a little romantic  I have not bravery sufficient to turn knighterrant and I must surpass even the renowned Don Quixote should I think of encountering the numerous host of rivals which your attachment might enrage  Sir HARRY  No madam your ladyship is mistaken there are not a vast number who at this time lay claim to my devoirs  Lady FRANKLAND  O but Sir Harry my heart is so very tender that I should be moved to restore you back to the groans of lady Subtle or the first stalking shade of those numberless ghosts your cruelty has made that might come to haunt me for you  Sir HARRY  I assure your ladyship you are wrong to make a jest of my behaviour to lady Subtle there are few men of my rank in life who have either morals or politeness sufficient to pay the least regard to a dying reputationNow madam it has ever been my principle and practice both never publickly to abandon a mistress and when I have been insufferably tired of a lady I have kept my chamber and seen no company for three days together in order to give her the credit of the rupture But you are not to expect such nice morals from the generality of men I'll assure you madam  Lady FRANKLAND  How you amaze me is this Sir Harry what you stile morals principles politeness to betray to expose a wretched woman surely I am in a dream I cannot think myself awake  Sir HARRY  Why truly madam I think we are both very near taking a nap we have wandered from the point strangely and I ought to beg your ladyship's pardon for having made so improper an use of the favour you have indulged me in Eh donc ma belle will you now seriously fix upon the happy man who is to love and be beloved by you  Lady FRANKLAND  You increase my astonishment every syllable you utter  Sir HARRY  She must be very ignorant to be so subject to wonder  Aside  Lady FRANKLAND  I am young perhaps not insensible but neither my youth nor sensibility shall ever betray me into imprudence If my affections are to be gained it must be time assiduity reflection the soft habitudes of friendship and esteem that must obtain them even without my choice  Sir HARRY  I admire you vastly madam upon my soul I dobut I have not the honour to be of the antient chivalry nor had I the least notion of your ladyship's allowing me the happiness of a tête à tête merely to assist you in composing a romance Adieu donc ma chere princesse belle heroine adieu  Exit  Lady FRANKLAND  Where will my wonder end Is this the man of gallantry the irresistable Sir Harry Wilmot Surely that woman must first be a dupe to her own passions who could comply with his Not such the lovers I have read of who sighed whole years in silence nor to the world revealed their bitter anguish their consuming pain the whispering woods alone were conscious of their woe till echo caught the sound and bore it on her dying voice to the beloved fair  Exit  SCENE III  The  PARK  Sir WILLIAM BELVILLE  This charming woman fills up all my thoughts my every wish is her's nay my whole soul What delicacy of sentiment what elegance of form and manners Happyrather say unhappy lord Frankland whose sure possession made him contemn a prize that kings might become rivals for  Enter  Sir HARRY  Sir HARRY  Why so grave Sir William  Sir WILLIAM  You mistake Sir Harry I was only thoughtful  Sir HARRY  Why curse me if ever I could distinguish between thought and gravity in all my life and as I look upon reflexion to be a mere dull mechanic sort of business I have resolved never to think while I live  Sir WILLIAM  A most rational resolution truly  Sir HARRY  But my dear Sir William egad I had like to have forgotyou are under the highest obligation to me this very moment and I will be thanked positively I will  Sir WILLIAM  You need but name it Sir Harry and rest assured of my gratitude  Sir HARRY  Why then Sir Knight I have atchieved such a feat in your favour as you will be transported atcleared the cover'd way my boy and left the defile open to you and you alone But not to arrogate too much I must confess that it was pure want of that noble spirit of perseverance which you are so amply possessed of that made me quit the assault for to say the truth I am tolerable enough at a skirmish but devilish bad at a siege  Sir WILLIAM  You speak in riddle Sir Harry pray explain yourself that I may thank you as I ought  Sir HARRY  Well then my dear Belville thus the matter standsWe have both of us you know sighed for that Delia that Cassandra that queen of all romance lady Frankland  Sir WILLIAM  Sir Harry lady Frankland has a husband and  Sir HARRY  Sir William I know she has andthey are parted but suppose they lived together is it not possible to fall in love with another man's wife  answer me that and from your heart my grave Sir William Belville  Sir WILLIAM  A passion in that place must be an hopeless one  Sir HARRY  Not at all I assure you for if I would but have starved on hope for a few days I might have lived on certainty as long as I lik'd it after But egad my constitution is not strong enough to fast through a lent though I were sure to feast at the carnival  Sir WILLIAM  Sir Harry I hope still I do not understand you lady Frankland's character is free from blame  Sir HARRY  And always shall be so for me I assure you but to be plain Sir William her ladyship did me the honour of an assignation this morning for all that  Sir WILLIAM  An assignation Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Ay positively a tête à tête  Sir WILLIAM  Go on Sir  In a surly tone  Sir HARRY  Go on Sir  egad I don't know whether I shall or no I fancy I have mistaken my man and instead of talking to my old friend Will Belville have stumbled on some country cousin who because he is related to her ladyship thinks it incumbent on his honour to vindicate her's  Go on Sir  Sir WILLIAM  Distraction torture  Aside  Sir Harry I was only impatient to know the result of this assignation  Sir HARRY  To be short then her ladyship assumed all the airs of an heroine in romance talked of constancy assiduity friendship esteemand modestly gave me to understand that I must dangle some months at least after her before she could think of rewarding my labour Ha ha  Sir WILLIAM  But did she promise to be kind upon these terms Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Why not expresly indeed but sure Belville you and I are too well acquainted with the sex not to know that a constant attendance for a fortnight a few warm sighs some drops of heat distilling from the eyes with a volley of flattery planted against her ears would have carried this proud princess captive and made her fink into my arms  Sir WILLIAM  Sir Harry notwithstanding the lightness of your manners I have ever believed you to be a man of honour I must therefore suppose that you have framed this story purely to try my opinion and regards for lady Frankland and that on that discovery you will freely own the falsehood  Sir HARRY  The falsehood Sir  Sir WILLIAM  Yes Sirto traduce that lady's honour is the basest meanest falsehood She grant you an assignation  Sir HARRY  By heaven she did  Sir WILLIAM  By heaven 'tis false and thus I will assert it  Draws  Sir HARRY  Nay then have at you in defence of truth  Draws  Sir WILLIAM  In defence of honour  They fight Sir Harry is disarm'd  Enter  CLARINDA  at the side of the stage  CLARINDA  Bless me what's the matter  Sir HARRY  Sir William my life is in your hands  Sir WILLIAM  Then take it freely I hope you are not hurt  returning his sword  Sir HARRY  Not much If you know how to use it this adventure will be a vast advantage to you A conquering lover is a treasure in romance virtue is her  fort  but sentiment her  foible  Help me to my chair 'tis at the park gate my wound grows painful and the walks begin to fill Do not boast of this affair to any one but lady Frankland  Sir WILLIAM  Upon my honour I shall not even to her Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Success attend you you deserve it  Sir WILLIAM  To deserve is to obtain Sir Harry for he who founds his schemes in honour has already secured  to himself that selfapplause which is more precious than any other gratification can possibly be  Exeunt Sir Harry leaning on Sir William  CLARINDA  comes forward  CLARINDA  "Virtue is her  fort  but  sentiment  her  foible"  That must be lady Frankland 'Tis very odd now I have coquetted with half a dozen at once and have been kind to two or three and yet never had the honour of a duel being sought for me tho' I have endeavoured to set the men together by the ears with all my might But these sly slow things that have either the reality or appearance of virtue do fifty times more mischief than we good natur'd generous hearted girls are capable of doing Or perhaps our gallants like our nation love fighting for fighting sake without any hopes of being paid for it  Enter  EMILIA  Oh Emilia such a dreadful accident  EMILIA  Bless me what has happened  CLARINDA  A duel between Sir William Belville and Sir Harry Wilmot  EMILIA  How did it end  with emotion  CLARINDA  I fear 'tis all over with poor Sir Harry  EMILIA  But Sir William dear Clarinda what of him  CLARINDA  So my little sly one you are caught I sind  EMILIA  Can one hear of bloodshed without concern  CLARINDA  But why distinguish between the combatants  EMILIA  Pshaw prithee tell me the whole of this story  CLARINDA  Prithee first tell me whether your emotion arises from  sentiment  or passion  EMILIA  Neither neither compassion all  CLARINDA  Well then all I know of the matter is that just now as I entered the park I saw these gentlemen both draw their swords and engage and before I could get up to the place Sir William had become master of Sir Harry's sword  EMILIA  Were they both wounded  CLARINDA  I cannot inform you I know Sir Harry was  EMILIA  Surely the provocation must have been great that could tempt them to draw in the park I thought Sir William had more temper and prudence Do you know the subject of this quarrel  CLARINDA  I know there was a woman in the case whom I dare pronounce to be lady Frankland  EMILIA  Impossible what right have either of them to asperse or vindicate her fame She neither does nor can belong to either of them  CLARINDA  That is perhaps the very reason why they fought about her A woman in her circumstances is looked upon as lawful plunder to which the longest sword gives a title  EMILIA  My dear unhappy friend I am grieved to the heart for her I was going to visit lord Frankland just across the park but I shall first return to her for a few minutes I intreat Clarinda that you will not mention this affair to any mortal  CLARINDA  Not I you may depend upon it The secret would burst me  Aside  But shall I send to know how Sir William does  EMILIA  Pshaw I hope he is not hurt with all my heart  CLARINDA  Farewell Emilia  Exit  As Emilia is going out she is met by Mr Frankland  Mr FRANKLAND  I am fortunate madam in meeting you in a place where you cannot avoid me  EMILIA  You are much mistaken Sir if you think it is not what I would wish to do in every place  Mr FRANKLAND  I have no reason to doubt your sincerity madam but it was carrying your cruelty too far to refuse reading my letterNo judge condemns unheard  EMILIA  I have heard you Sir and from your own lips condemn you nor can any of your artful palliatives ever induce me to change my opinion I therefore request that you will spare yourself and me the fruitless trouble of attempting it for be assured that I will never receive letter or message nor hold converse or commerce with you more  Mr FRANKLAND  For heaven's sake hear me one word my Emilia  EMILIA  No Sir But to rid you of perhaps your greatest uneasiness I promise you I never shall repeat the vile calumny you thought proper to insult me with so that your secret remains safer even in a woman's breast than it was in your own But for the future I advise you to be more cautious  Exit  Mr FRANKLAND  So then all is safe with regard to lord Frankland I findBut what an ass am I to think myself so while I am in the power of a woman no that can never be till she is in mine  Enter  PATRICK  Well Patrick have you seen Fontange  PATRICK  Yes please your honour I have seen her all over  Mr FRANKLAND  What's all over  PATRICK  Why by my shoul she is all over impudence I think  Mr FRANKLAND  What do you mean  PATRICK  Why faith when I enquir'd for her below they said she was above so up I went to the top of the house to the very garret to her chambray as she call'd it and knocked at the door out of pure civility she answer'd enter or entry or something like that so in I went and found her sowing on her bodices without so much as an apron or bedgown about her shouldersaugh she has made me sick about the heart  Mr FRANKLAND  You are plaguy dainty truly to be offended at seeing a woman half naked  PATRICK  Augh hone my jewel if it was one of my own country girls with a skin as white as a crud or a new potatoe it would not have affected my stomach that way  Mr FRANKLAND  Well hold your nonsensedid she promise to come to my chambers  PATRICK  Faith honey it is but ask and have with her I'll be bound she is there already  Mr FRANKLAND  And you blockhead have got the keys run home directly I'll follow you as quick as possible fly  PATRICK  Troth let her wait I'll not fly a step for her  Mr FRANKLAND  Be gone  Exeunt Patrick running  End of the  THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  A drawingroom in  Lady FRANKLAND  's house  Lady FRANKLAND and EMILIA  Lady FRANKLAND  YOU cannot imagine my dear Emilia how much I am shocked at what you have told me I fear I shall now become a common topic of discourse What a triumph for lord Frankland his character will rise upon the ruin of mineGood heaven what will become of me  EMILIA  Indeed my dear lady Frankland you first deceive yourself and then argue right upon wrong principles You must certainly imagine lord Frankland a monster before you can suppose it possible for him to rejoice at your dishonour On the contrary I am certain he would be sensible of the highest concern were he acquainted even with your present distress  Lady FRANKLAND  O do not say so Emilia I can bear his resentment better than his pity I fear I have deserved the one and am certain I have no claim to the other  EMILIA  You judge too hardly of yourself my dear but I have strong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his or any other ears Sir Harry has nothing to boast of we may therefore depend on his silence and I have too good an opinion of Sir William Belville to suppose him capable of ever  mentioning it and I would not have your ladyship seem to know one word of the matter  Lady FRANKLAND  Grant it should remain a secret Emilia how painful must my situation be conscious of the highest obligation which I must not acknowledge even to the generous hand that has conferr'd it To a mind open and grateful as mine this must be torture  EMILIA  Have a care lady Frankland of overrating the obligation Sir William knows that your situation cannot admit of a return and if I am not much deceiv'd with regard to his character his sentiments are too generous to expect one  Lady FRANKLAND  By shewing my want of power to repay it you but enhance the debt  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  Sir William Belville madam  Exit  Lady Frankland looks at Emilia in some confusion  Enter  Sir WILLIAM  Sir WILLIAM  Your servant ladies I scarce expected the pleasure of finding you at home this fine day when all the world is abroad  Lady FRANKLAND  That may perhaps be one reason for our staying at home Sir William I hate crowds of every kind  Sir WILLIAM  If half the world could entertain themselves or others as either of you ladies can there would  scarce be such a thing as a crowd select parties and rational conversation would then become the fashion But when the mind is vacant of ideas its activity will seek them from outward objects which strike upon the senses yet leave no more impression than our forms do on a looking glass while the charms of refined sense and elegant converse remain indelible upon the soul  EMILIA  For my part Sir William I relinquish any share in that very fine compliment for I confess I have great pleasure in seeing a number of well dressed people together looking as if they were pleased themselves and wishing to please others and I should certainly have been in the park an hour ago if I had not staid in compliment to her ladyship  Lady FRANKLAND  You render me uneasy Emilia pray do not suffer your complaisance for me to trespass on your pleasures  Sir WILLIAM  Tho' you modestly refuse it madam you have still a part in the eulogium nor is it for want of ideas in yourself but to inspire them in others that you need ever wish to appear in public and who that sees Emilia must not be captivated with the pleasing one of sprightly innocence  EMILIA  Ay but then Sir William  it leaves no more impression than our forms do on a looking glass  you know so I'll even vanish away  Exit  Sir WILLIAM  All forms however pleasing are transient I confess but when animated by a noble mind they then become such substances as stars are made of  Lady FRANKLAND  Then sure my dear Emilia may shine forth the morning's harbinger for never was there yet a nobler mind join'd to a fairer person  Sir WILLIAM  The comparison had been more just madam had you alluded to our nightly planet which borrows its reflected light from the bright sun as she from you  Lady FRANKLAND  Your compliment is so very high Sir William that there is no replying to it We seem to have got beyond the clouds and had better beware the fate of Icarus  Sir WILLIAM  It were falling indeed madam to descend to any terrestrial subject while I have the happiness of contemplating and conversing with a seraph  Lady FRANKLAND  Upon my word Sir William your extravagant politeness distresses me yet I confess my foible if it is one in being pleased at being approved and esteemed by a person of your refined sentiments I hope too that it is a pleasure I may indulge with innocence  Sir WILLIAM  Transporting sound my raptures are too strong for expression Thus give me leave to thank you  Kneels and kisses her hand  Lady FRANKLAND  Oh Sir William beware of ecstasies they are alas inconsistent with my hapless lot  Sir WILLIAM  Never madam shall I aspire to higher bliss than what I now enjoy  Bowing respectfully▪  Lady FRANKLAND  Perhaps Sir William I have been led too far▪But still remember Sir that I am bound by the strongest ties They must be preserved inviolate and if I am really dear to you you will ever hold them sacred  Sir WILLIAM  Far far from Belville's heart be every wish for transient joys attended by remorse much sooner would he die than e'er create a pang in the soft bosom of sair innocence  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  Lady Fanshaw madam  Lady FANSHAW  I vow you are a most unaccountable creature lady Frankland I have waited for you this full hour and what is worse I am afraid the auction is begun and the room so stuff'd that we shall not be able to see the beautiful pagoda nor get into the circle among the men but be jamm'd up in some obscure nook among the canaille who frequent such places merely to stare at their betters and poison the air with the fumes of tobacco  Lady FRANKLAND  I ask your ladyship many pardonsI utterly forgot to order a card to be sent to let you know I could not attend you this morning  Lady FANSHAW  Vastly polite trulynot go with me after preventing my being there two hours ago and getting a seat close to the auctioneer I should have had the very best place ma'am Mr Langford and I are very well acquainted  Sir WILLIAM  By your own account madam her ladyship has done you a favour by preventing you from being squeez'd up in a crowd  Lady FANSHAW  You are vastly mistaken Sir there is nothing more pleasant and healthful too and I am certain half the people of fashion in London would die of fevers if it were not for the benefit of perspiration which they can only receive in such places as they are too delicate to use exercise sufficient to procure it any other way  Sir WILLIAM  This is really madam the only rational argument I ever heard urged in favour of a crowd and I shall henceforth consider myself or any of my friends in such a situation as only suffering a painful operation for the benefit of health  Lady FANSHAW  But now dear lady Frankland you have not an idea of what you will lose if you don't come with me directly there's my lord Mount Fashion who has travelled thro' Persia and the Mogul's country purely to acquire a knowledge in painting and architecture makes his first public appearance there this morning and will decide exactly with regard to the value of the bronzes and the antiquity of the china  Sir WILLIAM  Such a virtuoso must be equally an honour and advantage to his country surely  Lady FANSHAW  O but Sir William they say he is a mighty pretty fellow too in short all the pretty fellows in Town will be thereDo come for heaven's sake lady Frankland I shall break my heart if I don't  go and I can't decently stalk in alone like one that nobody knows  Lady FRANKLAND  Rather than your ladyship should suffer so extreme a disappointment come then I will accompany you  Lady FANSHAW  Away away then quickly my dear my chariot is at the door Your's Sir William  Lady FRANKLAND  Sir William your servant  Exeunt Ladies  Sir WILLIAM  Lord Mount Fashion and all the pretty fellows in town there sure that could not be the motive for her goingYet she absolutely refused till they were mentioned nor once desired me to accompany her This is strange Oh she is too dear to my fond heart I cannot bear that other men should gaze upon her charms for if they do they'll love I'll follow at a distance and observe her she will attract all eyes and I may pass unnotic'd  Exit  SCENE II  Lord Frankland  's dressingroom  Lord FRANKLAND and EMILIA  Lord FRANKLAND  So you think Emilia that lady Frankland reads too much  EMILIA  I do indeed my lord  Lord FRANKLAND  Were her books well chosen that could hardly be but I fear her studies serve rather to augment  than amend her only foible But pray Emilia who are lady Franlkand's chief intimates I do not mean the crowds that fill her drawing room but those who are admitted en famille  EMILIA  Does your lordship mean men or women  Lord FRANKLAND  Both Emilia but more particularly the latter for I would have you and every woman I regard more nice in the choice of their female even than their male acquaintance Believe me much depends upon it  EMILIA  Lady Fanshaw and Clarinda are I think the most intimate of our female friends Sir Harry Wilmot and Sir William Belville are more frequently with us than any other men  Lord FRANKLAND  You surprize me Emilia Clarinda intimate with lady Frankland I am sorry for it  EMILIA  And why my lord Clarinda is sprightly sensible and chearful  Lord FRANKLAND  Beware of that spirit sense and gaiety Emilia which have not virtue for their base they are dangerous instruments in dangerous hands I am shock'd at her intimacy with my wife which she has compassed since our separation and if I have yet any influence with lady Frankland or with you you will both immediately quit all connection there The rest of the persons you have named I am unacquainted with except Sir William Belville who bears the character of a man of honour Clarinda lady Frankland those names ought never to be joined  EMILIA  I am very certain my lord that lady Frankland would sacrifice any thing on earth to your desire I will answer for it that she gives up Clarinda directly I promise your lordship that I shall  Lord FRANKLAND  Do not flatter me Emilia could she have sacrific'd her only foible to my fond love we had been blest indeed  EMILIA  Pardon me my lord if I suspect that foible might have been cured if proper means had been applied  Lord FRANKLAND  Do not speak of it Emilia my wounds all bleed afresh There was no way to cure it nor could we have lived on any terms but by indulging it to an excess which must have rendered us both contemptible I am impatient till you see my wife alas all that remains to me of that endearing name is that fair shadow  pointing to the picture  Let her break off all further commerce with Clarinda if she regards her own honour or my peace  EMILIA  Your lordship need not doubt your being obey'd  Exit  Lord FRANKLAND  I am grieved at thinking what may be the event of this connection All women who have forfeited their own title to virtue envy those who possess it and would wish to sink them to their own base level I am certain lady Frankland is virtuous open and sincere But alas what arms are these to combat the charms of flattery the attractions of  pleasure and the snares of seduction should she sink under them I surely am to blame who have exposed her youth and inexperience to a trial perhaps too hard But should she pass this more than ordeal fire unsullied and unhurt she will be something more than woman and adoration late her claim will then become her due I'll hope the best  Exit  SCENE III  Mr Frankland  's chambers  PATRICK solus  PATRICK  What can my master and that ugly mademoiselle there be doing in the bedchamber within this full half hour together Sure the devil would not put an ill thing in his head Faith myself will peep through the keyhole and try  Looks in  No such thing at all they are talking very fast tho' and there can't be no great harm sure in list'ning to their discourse since it would not be about love  Claps his ear to the keyhole  O faith here they come and a body may hear something now  Retires to the side of the scene  Enter  Mr FRANKLAND  and  FONTANGE  FONTANGE  Upon a my  ord conceleur I do run a de very great dangere for your service Madame Emilic she be de heiress you know and that do make a it de hanging matter for pauvre Fontange Ah Morblieu si je sera pendue What a disgrace to my family not one of dem would own a me if I should be hanged  Mr FRANKLAND  Courage mademoiselle the hazard is not so great as you imagine then think of the reward A thousand pounds Why that will enable you to return to your own country with eclat set up an equigage and outshine half the women in Languedoc Why a thousand English pounds Fontange twenty thousand livres Françoises is the portion of a marchioness there  FONTANGE  But are you very sure your

Fontange I will have a de bond ready for your honour to sign when you come a to de house  Mr FRANKLAND  With all my heart mademoiselle Would I had signed and sealed with Emilia  FONTANGE  Tout en bon temsAdieu Monsieur adieu  Exeunt severally  Patrick  comes forward  PATRICK  Myself was never so bothered what to do in the course of my whole life To be sure I would be glad my master was married to madam Emilia because I believe he loves her But this stealing her away by night has an ugly look with itAnd to have that wicked mademoiselle get a good thousand pound for helping to ruin the innocent creature augh that would vex me to the heart I'll go directly and consult with my old friend and gossip  Jimmy Kavanagh  that is in a good place here in town and may be he would tell me what I would do for I don't much care to betray my poor master neither  Exit  SCENE IV  A drawing room  Sir HARRY WILMOT  in a nightgown  CLARINDA  sitting with him  Sir HARRY  I vow Clarinda this was vastly kind now and really more than I deserve but I declare you are the very paragon of goodnature  CLARINDA  Why truly Sir Harry I must say it shews a most dovelike disposition in me to hazard my reputation by visiting a man who has just now endangered his life for another lady  Sir HARRY  There you are mistaken Clarinda curse me if I either did or would fight for any woman in Englandexcept yourself ma belle fille  CLARINDA  O your servant SirBut what could have been your cause of quarrel then For Sir William I think never plays  Sir HARRY  Why that same doughty knighterrant you have named took it into his wise head that because a certain fair lady had never allowed him a tête à tête she never meant to indulge herself or any body else with one and upon my declaring that she had done me that favour talked in a high ridiculous romantic strain of the lady's honour and character and seemed to hint as if he suspected me of a falsehood That you'll allow was not to be endured  CLARINDA  O by no means Sir Harry However I have not quite so much pity for you as I had as you were paid I suppose beforehand A tête à tête with lady Frankland was I think an overpayment for the slight scratch you have received But you certainly did ill to boast I could not have suspected you of so much dishonour Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  Why now my dear Clarinda there's the mischief on't I had nothing to boast of for this same petite partie ended in a very absurd proposal on her side for entering into the Platonic system which I positively refused Car je n'ai pas le tems Admired the elegant impracticability of her ladyship's seraphics made my bow and withdrew  CLARINDA  Very absurd and ridiculous truly Equally so on both sides I never could have supposed that a man who knows the world as well as you have a right to do could have slipp'd such an opportunity so simply Ha ha ha  Sir HARRY  Why faith Clarinda there is a kind of bashful courage about those modest dames that is capable of putting the most impudent fellow in the world out of countenance and tho' I was never in better spirits for an attack she talked so queerly of friendship esteem honour and such stuff that she left me little to say and less to do so I e'en quitted the field and marched off  CLARINDA  Shame of all cowards say I if your double defeat should be known you will be hooted out of the world both of love and gallantry and faith you deserve it  Sir HARRY  Point de tout ma chere fille no man is wise or brave at all times and I shall only smile at my late defeat if I can but triumph here  taking hold of her hand  CLARINDA  Pshaw let me go it would be scandalous in me to submit to a beaten generalconquest is the road to conquest both in love and war and the illustrious name of our victorious leader has been a legion added to our troops English women as well as men chuse to list under a brave commander  Sir HARRY  Vastly severe and piquant truly but I shall have my reprisals some other time  CLARINDA  You'll have better luck than you deserve then Farewel poor recreant knight  Sir HARRY  Adieu ma bizarre  Exeunt severally  SCENE V  The street before Lady Frankland's house  Enter Sir  WILLIAM  Sir WILLIAM  Love and jealousy are twins I find born in the selfsame moment What transports have I felt what agonies endured within a few short hours That angel form which blessed my eyes and ears this morn e're noon transformed into a mortal object surrounded by a crowd of coxcombs By heaven she freely gave her hand to lord MountFashion and suffered him to lead her from that vulgar scene of hurry noise and nonsense I'll see if she is returned  Raps at the door and enter Nicodemus  Is your lady at home friend  NICODEMUS  Noa Sir I'se wish she were for servants are all well y'clemmed and cook says dinner's aspoilingMadam Emilia's at home tho' if your honour pleases to walk in  Sir WILLIAM  No friend 'tis very well  Exit Nicodemus and shuts the door  And yet I think I will go in and wait for her  Raps again  NICODEMUS  Soa Sir what mun you want now  Sir WILLIAM  I have changed my mind and will go in to wait for your lady's return  NICODEMUS  You'se welcome I'se swear you'se a person of quality for they never know their own minds  Aside  Do walk in Sir pray  Exeunt  SCENE VI  A dressingroom  EMILIA  painting Enter Sir  WILLIAM  Sir WILLIAM  After the declaration you made this morning it surprizes me madam to find you in this retired situation  EMILIA  One often says more Sir William as well as less than they think according to the degree of spirits they happen to be in I confess myself a rattle and have vivacity enough to be fond of public places Yet I very soon tire of them and frequently prefer the gaiety of these little objects which I can create with my pencil and the enjoyment of my own thoughts to the more glaring shadows which surround me abroad and no thought at all 'Tis vastly pleasant to think sometimes Sir William  Sir WILLIAM  They are indeed truly unhappy who do not find it so Guilt alone can make reflection painful  EMILIA  I must differ with you Sir William for I really know many good sort of people who I am sure  have nothing to reproach themselves with yet for want of an early habit dread sitting alone as much as if they feared spirits and would run into any kind of company rather than endure their own  Sir WILLIAM  Charming sensible unaffected girl  aside  He must be a happy man Emilia who shall share the pleasures of retirement with a companion lively and rational as you  EMILIA  Pray do not make me vain Sir William perhaps no body may have it so much in their power as you  Sir WILLIAM  That declaration ought to make me proud madamBut I have been so charmed with your sentiments upon retirement that I almost forgot the occasion of my intruding upon yours Do you know any thing of lady Frankland Does she dine at home  EMILIA  I have not seen her since morning but I am so well acquainted with her ladyship's regularity and politeness that I have not the least doubt of her returning to dinner  looking at her watch  Bless me 'tis very late I have never known her stay so long abroad  Sir WILLIAM  I have some little business to communicate to her ladyship and shall take the liberty of waiting on her soon after dinner  Going  A noise of rapping at a door within  EMILIA  O here she comes and as you say you have business I shall withdraw but pray don't detain her long Sir William for I am vastly hungry  Exit  Lady Frankland speaking before she comes in  Lady FRANKLAND  Will my dear Emilia excuse me this trespass on her patience But I vow it was not possible for me to get away from lord MountFashion one moment sooner  Enters  Sir William your servant  Sir WILLIAM  Your's Madam I am surprized that his lordship could part with you even now Madam I did suppose you had been gone to dine with him at lady Fanshaw's or some other of his lordship's fond admirers  Lady FRANKLAND  I don't understand you Sir William I should certainly have dined abroad if I had happened to have one of my own servants with me to have sent home to Emilia I did not expect the favour of your company Sir therefore cannot charge myself with any want of politeness toward you  Sir WILLIAM  Want of politenefs Madam is that a term to me whose heartstrings you have strained and taught to feel more racking agonies than e'er Damien knew keep your politeness for your lord MountFashion Madam I hoped I had an higher claim  Lady FRANKLAND  Are these the sentiments Sir William which gave that claim Where is that nice respect those soft expressions of friendship and esteem which pleaded for that claim  Sir WILLIAM  Vanished Madam fled in the moment that you gave your hand to that same peregrine lord  Lady FRANKLAND  Delusion all they never yet existed in your breast selflove alone assumed the form of sentimental passion and has imposed on you but never shall again on me  Sir WILLIAM  Cruel unkind vain metaphysical distinction you know I would sacrifice a thousand lives to please you detach myself from the whole universe and give up every thought to you and you alone Is this selflove  Lady FRANKLAND  True love requires no sacrifice but the heart self love must have its triumphs suspicion is its constant mate and the least degree of complaisance shewn to another object appears a robbery to selfish minds In short there can be no slavery equal to that a jealous lover would impose  Sir WILLIAM  I Madam I render you a slave you Madam whose empire is so absolutely over me  Lady FRANKLAND  Sir William I shall ever acknowledge the highest obligations to you you have drawn me from the verge of a precipice into which my own imprudence had like to have plunged meI awake from an illusion and can dream no moreBe my friend still this is the only rank that you can ever hold in my regards  Sir WILLIAM  Heavens Madam what crime have I committed that you should wish my death  Lady FRANKLAND  Far from it Sir William I wish your happiness so far as it may not be inconsistent with my own and by depriving you of all right to be jealous I lay you under the happy necessity of ceasing to be so I begin to dread the violence of your temper and what we fear we cannot love  Sir WILLIAM  I begin to know you Madam in my turn the refinement of a platonic passion but ill agrees with the slightness of your conduct Sir Harry Wilmot would have been a more suitable lover and I was certainly wrong to interfere  Lady FRANKLAND  Stop there Sir William I know already how much I am indebted to you upon that occasion and shall therefore retire to save you the confusion of having reproached me with an obligation which even this behaviour cannot cancel nor shall I forget  Exit  Sir WILLIAM  Distraction what have I done upbraided lady Frankland she is she must be irrecoverably lost to me But by what bond could I have hoped to hold her Platonics I am now convinced are all a jest and her virtue and my own honour both forbid all other ties  Accursed jealousy too well you prove  The fallacy of sentimental love  If for themselves alone we sought the fair  Kindness to others would not cause despair  But when selflove begins to warp the mind  We dread a rival in each passing wind  End of the Fourth  ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  Lady  FRANKLAND  's dressing room  Lady  FRANKLAND  and  EMILIA  Lady FRANKLAND  MY dearest Emilia I have now opened my whole soul to you My mind is a perfect chaos yet I feel as if a weight had been taken off my breast by this most fortunate breach with Sir William Oh my Emilia how near have I been to ruin I am frighted even at the prospect  EMILIA  You should contemplate it rather with that kind of pleasure with which they view the wreck who have just escaped the storm with a proper sense toward providence and a steady purpose never to run the same risque again  Lady FRANKLAND  Humbled as I now am Emilia such resolutions are natural and bare remembrance of the peril I've escaped must certainly insure my perseverance But alas my friend have I not reason to accuse my fate for turning those advantages which are deemed a blessing to my sex into a curse for me youth beauty innocence and sensibility to what have ye reduced me to become the sport of foppery or victim of jealousy Is this the world I have been taught to admire For what illusions have I strayed from real happiness which I am now convinced is only to be found in the calm indulgence  of rational affections In the repose rather than tumult of the soul  EMILIA  I rejoice to find that the natural good sense of my amiable friend has been only hoodwinked but not blinded and that she can so clearly see her errors now  Lady FRANKLAND  Yes wretch that I am I see them but too late after I have forfeited the friendship the confidence and regards of the best of men and husbands thank heaven though that I have nothing to reproach myself with except imprudence and yet Emilia can I hope that Lord Frankland should take my word for this or even condescend to listen to my justification How I detest the writers of romance Oh Emilia 'tis but too easy to swerve from the right path but difficult indeed to recover it again  EMILIA  Why difficult the little deviation you have made requires no artful clue There are no bars against you but those your fears create Lord Frankland is still the same tender affectionate husband he has ever been and gave a proof of it this morning by requesting you to quit all farther intimacy with Clarinda whom he seems to think no safe companion for your honour  Lady FRANKLAND  Another precipice an angel's guard has surely hovered over me O were he to forbid my converse with all the world with light itself with every thing but thee nay nay even with thee Emilia his will should be obeyed  EMILIA  My heart exults at finding yours so sensible of duty O Lady Frankland you have indeed  escaped from many dangers yet unknown Nor can a wife e'er find a place of safety but under the protection of that heavenappointed guard her husband Lose not a moment then but let us fly to your asylumThat generous man who has ever pitied and bewailed your errors will open wide his arms to your returning virtue  Lady FRANKLAND  Alas Emilia a certain native pride or rather conscious shame which generous minds alone are capable of restrains my steps I must first endeavour to be reconciled to myself before I can even hope for his forgiveness  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  Mr Ambrose is come to wait upon your ladyship  Lady FRANKLAND  In a lucky minute sure a thought has just occurredIf blest with success my dear Emilia shall be the first partaker of my joy For the present leave me  Exit Emilia expressing by her looks and gesture her joy and wishes  Desire Mr Ambrose to walk in  Exit Nicodemus  Now for the last act of expiring romance  Enter  AMBROSE  How does my Lord and yours good Ambrose  AMBROSE  In health may heaven be praised for it I have not been so happy as to see your ladyship for some time past though I have called here daily by my lord's command  Lady FRANKLAND  I am obliged to his lordship and to you also Mr Ambrose  AMBROSE  O madam would it were within my power to oblige your ladyship your poor old servant would lay down his life to shew his duty  Lady FRANKLAND  Then Ambrose you have it in your power to do me a most essential service  AMBROSE  Your Ladyship has but to command and I obey Would to heaven that my lord and you loved yourselves but as well as I love either of you I know not which of you was to blame but I am sure my heart bleeds for you both How it used to delight me to see you together It was a blessed sight and since your separation I have seen nothing but affliction in our house  Lady FRANKLAND  I take the blame upon myself good Ambrose yet I have hopes my fault may be repaired if you will but implicitly follow my directions  AMBROSE  Doubtless madam I shall obey  Lady FRANKLAND  You know that my picture remains still in my lord's house  AMBROSE  Ay madam and my lord knows it too full well he shuts himself up with it whole days gazes on it talks to it then sighs enough to break one's heart to hear him'Tis all his company and consolation nowI dare not speak But  Lady FRANKLAND  Your words pierce through my soul I have not merited this kindness I thought his heart insensible  and cold dead to all tenderness for me but let his generous foftness quicken mine Ambrose you must steal that picture for me and bring it hither this very instant unseen by mortal eye  AMBROSE  What madam rob my master of his only treasure Bid me lay down my life and I'll obey  Lady FRANKLAND  Be assured I do not mean to deprive him of it This evening you shall replace it in my husband's chamber My sole request is that you will not let him know it has been moved You can't refuse me sure  AMBROSE  Your ladyship is goodness itself and I can't suppose you would put an end to my life by the grief it would give me to afflict or offend the best of mastersI will then instantly obey your ladyship's commandsBut pray good lady remember that it must be restored this very evening  Lady FRANKLAND  You may rely upon my promise indeed good Ambrose  Exit  Ambrose  To hymen's sacred power though late an ardent votary I bendOh may he prosper and assist my purpose  Exit  SCENE II  An apartment in  Lady FANSHAW  's house  Lady FANSHAW  and  CLARINDA  CLARINDA  I can't tell you how much I am disappointed at the folly of that coxcomb Sir HarryI had great hopes that his spirited assurance might have conquered her timid bashfulness and a breach once  made in that bastion the citadel falls of course I begin to fear she'll conterwork us all and either keep the fortress in her own hands or perhaps deliver it back again to the former governor in  statu quo  Lady FANSHAW  I can't agree with you Clarinda though even Sir Harry has failed For I dare swear no woman ever parted from her husband with a design of playing the drude with all the rest of the world I fancy now that Sir William will carry the townnot by storm indeed but by starving the besieged into terms of capitulation  CLARINDA  I don't understand your ladyship  Lady FANSHAW  Why then in plainer English Sir William is grown jealous and will if possible prevent any other man from coming near her By this means she will find herself prisoner and may then probably surrender her person to obtain her liberty en parole at least  CLARINDA  You deal still in tropes Lady Fanshaw  Lady FANSHAW  Ay but you understand me for all that Clarinda You know full well that when a woman puts herself into the power of a man he becomes a tyrant she a slave from that moment and all the difference I can find between marriage and gallantry is that one is perpetual the other temporary only  CLARINDA  I care not by what means her ruin is accomplished provided it be accomplished Her fatal marriage with Lord Frankland blasted all my  hopes and I cannot bear to think that she should taste the heartfelt joy of her own virtue while I am deprived of that as well as of what I resigned it for  Lady FANSHAW  Nay as to that Clarinda it is no such mighty matter that one need wish to rob her of it for we both know with regard to the world the appearance will answer as well as the reality But if you are bent upon her ruin blast her reputation my dearThe story you told me of the duel properly managed is sufficient to do that effectually  CLARINDA  That alone shall destroy her fame should she even preserve her chastity which you seem to think improbable  Lady FANSHAW  I have half a score visits to make to morrow morning and I shall take care to whisper this adventure in every one of them with the tenderest professions of pity for her misfortune and a  who could have suspected it I vow I thought her perfectly innocent but I am afraid lord Frankland had his reasonsthough he had too much pride to publish them  CLARINDA  This will do my dear Lady Fanshaw for let women value themselves ever so much upon their innocence the loss of character is next to that of virtue  Lady FANSHAW  O much worse ClarindaBut I must go and visit that simple Sir Harry as he is confined I own I despise him but to persons of certain ranks in life one must be civil you know  CLARINDA  I shall send to know if Lady Frankland be at home If she is I'll pay her a visit perhaps Sir William may be there and I may possibly discover something to corroborate our story But that silly chit Emilia never leaves her so that the woman wants opportunity were she ever so well inclinedI wish that girl was any how out of the way  Lady FANSHAW  She'll marry Charles Frankland and be a wretch  Exeunt  SCENE III  Sir William BELVILLE  's house  Sir WILLIAM  and his servant  Sir WILLIAM  You have told me a most extraordinary story James are you sure your countryman's veracity may be depended upon  SERVANT  Please your honour I have known him from a child and never had cause to doubt itHe is simply honest  Sir WILLIAM  Then sure his master is an horrid villain bid your friend attend me in my studyI must have all the particulars from himself  Exit servant  Can it be possible there lives a wretch so vile to form a scheme for violating helpless innocence and spoiling blooming beauty my fair my sensible Emilia I will protect thee at the hazard of my life surely she holds a place within my breast its feelings are too strong for friendship's power her danger has awakened all my tenderness endeared her to my soul and made me know esteem to be the surest base for love  Exit  SCENE IV  The street before  Lady FRANKLAND  's house  Enter a footman with a card in his hand as he is staring about for the house Mr Frankland comes softly down the side of the stage muffled in a cloak Fontange opens the door looks about and lets him in  FOOTMAN  That was as nicely done now as if I had a hand in it myself High presto pass and be goneas the conjurer says That must be the house for I saw my lady's ugly Frenchwoman open the doorAye aye I am right  Raps at the door  Enter  NICODEMUS  FOOTMAN  So NicHow do'st do my lad Is your Lady at home  NICODEMUS  Why ayeI think so  FOOTMAN  There carry that card to her then from my lady madam Clarinda and bring me an answer straight  Exit Nicodemus  NICODEMUS  Nic has a rare place of it surelySuch a fine handsome woman as his mistress must have a deal of rich gallants come after herAnd she is not cruel I find  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  My lady will write an answer directly and you mun stay to carry it for ise get going enough  FOOTMAN  You're a lucky rogue Nic to get into such a service to have so beautiful a young lady your mistressI warrant me you'll be for purchasing into the funds by and by  NICODEMUS  Funds I believe you'se making fun of meWhy mon since those cursed sociations for dropping of vails have been in fashion a poor sarvant can scarce keep himself whole and clean Funds quotha  FOOTMAN  Why really as you say since the incroachment upon our perquisites it is not worth any man of spirit's while to wear a livery except where there is a little private business going forwardYou understand me and in that case we must be touched handsomely for hushmoney you know I'll warrant now you make above forty pounds a year of your lady  NICODEMUS  Not I as I hope to be savedShe gives me but the bare ten guineas and I have hardly any requisites at all for my lady don't love play  FOOTMAN  Don't she really  Bell ringsNic goes out and returns with a letter  NICODEMUS  Here's my lady's answer  FOOTMAN  Good by to you friend Nic Since you're so plaguy dry  NICODEMUS  That indeed I am alwaysAnd should be glad to take a pot of beer with you with all my heart  FOOTMAN  Another time may serve good Mr Slyboots  Exeunt severally  SCENE  draws and discovers  FONTANGE  leading in Mr  FKANKLAND  FONTANGE  Oh I am all in a fluster I tremble from head to foot If you do not succeed that madame Clarinda's serviteur discovery meHe saw me at de doorO de bonté monsieur what vill become of me if she be not very very quiet  Mr FRANKLAND  Why faith mademoiselle I find myself a little disconcerted too at present and have a foreboding sufficient to deter another man from the attempt but I am determined to proceed in spite of qualms either of my conscience or her virtueThis night puts an end to my life or my misfortunes I come prepared you see  Draws out a pistol  FONTANGE  O de bonne grace you terrify me out of my lifeWhy monsieur if you should shoot a yourself the king he

satisfaction to my own conscience that I did no commit a de sin for noting  Signs the bond  FRANKLAND  There mademoiselle and may you be intitled to your reward with all my heart It is not witnessed therefore not valid  Aside  FONTANGE  Je vous rend mille grace monsieurThe bell ring get into that closet de key is in de insideBe sure you no stir till all de house be in de bed  FRANKLAND  Doubt not my discretion  He goes into the closet and exit mademoiselle  SCENE V  An apartment in  Lady FANSHAW  's house  Lady FANSHAW  and  CLARINDA  discovered at cards  Lady FANSHAW  You are repiqued Clarinda  CLARINDA  Well that makes us even I wish Thomas was returned  They rise  Enter  BETTY  and delivers a letter to  CLARINDA  BETTY  From Lady Frankland ma'm  CLARINDA  To me what can it mean  Opens and reads  Lady Frankland's and Emilia's compliments to Clarinda and request she will not give herself  the trouble of coming any more to Lady Frankland's house as they are under a necessity of declining her visits for reasons not proper to be explained  Forbid the house this is astonishing  Lady FANSHAW  It would almost tempt one to think they had a familiar who could discover your heart to them  BETTY  For that matter I believe one of them is familiar enoughwith the gentlemen at least if what Thomas says be true  Lady FANSHAW  Why really Betty gentlemen are the most agreeable familiars a lady can have  BETTY  Very true to be sure my lady but too much familiarity breeds content as the proverb says and I never should have thought of repeating what Thomas told me the longest day I have to live if it was not for their hypocrisy in refusing the visits of such a sweet virtuous lady as my mistress that I have known as it were from a child But some folks have fair faces and foul hearts in troth  CLARINDA  They had better have shut other people's doors against me than their own for henceforth where I enter they never more shall be receivedI'll blast that little prudish minx Emilia too I'll say any thing of them both that revenge can instigate  BETTY  Upon my verily ma'm I cannot bear to see you so instigationed by slights and malice when if you knew but all you need not be beholding to inventions in the least ma'm for as sure as day and as I hope to be saved ma'm Thomas saw a man  muffled up in a disguise let in just n  w to Lady Frankland's house by her mademaselle there who to be sure and sartin is like the rest of her countrywomen no better than she should be  Lady FANSHAW  Ha Clarinda this is a lucky discovery for youI find her grave ladyship has not consined her studies intirely to romance but has dipt a little into the more practical business of novel too and seems to be a pretty apt scholar for her time truly  CLARINDA  This secret is worth a millionwho could he be  Lady FANSHAW  It must certainly be the sly Sir William  CLARINDA  No matter whoShe is now in my power and I will use the advantageThis very instant I will write to Lord Frankland he may command admittance though I am denied  for reasons not proper to be explained  and will I hope  find reason  to be convinced that her affected delicacy is as easily conquered as the natural openness of my too generous heart  BETTY  I am sure it would be a burning sin and shame too not to detract and ruinate such vild hypocrite creatures for a couple of slippery heels as they are  Lady FANSHAW  I am of opinion Clarinda that your information will have but little weight with Lord Frankland as you may be supposed to have some interest in the discovery  CLARINDA  You are mistaken madam he has the quickest sense of honour and will fly either to convict or acquit herBid Thomas be in the way to carry my Letter  Exit Betty  What a triumph will be mine this night I shall expose and laugh to scorn the saintlike Lady Frankland tear off the veil she has so long assumed and shew her genuine features to the world  Lady FANSHAW  Well come my dear do give vent to your refentmentor it may hurt you mightily  Exeunt  SCENE VI  Lord  FRANKLAND  's dressingroom  Lady  FRANKLAND  's picture deprived of all its ornaments the hair dishevelled tears streaming from the eyes and the hands in a supplicating posture  Enter  Lord FRANKLAND  Lord FRANKLAND  I am uneasy till I know from Emilia whether my wife has broke off her intercouse with ClarindaWhy should I doubt it she never yet opposed my will her temper's easy as her air calm placid and serene as that fair semblance  Turns toward the picture and starts  Ha what enchantment's this that countenance no longer placid and serene speaks agonizing woe the hair dishevelled too the hands held up in supplication can it be to me tears streaming from the eyes the precious drops perhaps of penitence and love amazement all Who waits  Enter  AMBROSE  Ambrose look there explain this wonder to my astonished sense while I have reason left to comprehend you How came that picture thus  AMBROSE  My dearest lord upon my bended knees I beg forgiveness but could you have seen with what an earnest fondness and desire she urged me to this deed you would yourself have granted her requestHow then could I refuse  Lord FRANKLAND  Do not torture me but say with brevity and truth who urged you to this deed  AMBROSE  O moderate the strong emotions of your mind and I will tell you all It was my lady Frankland your lordship's fond repentant faithful wifeBut if the crime be past forgiveness O let your anger fall on me even drive me from your sight which of all punishments would be the saddest to me but forgive my lady  Lord FRANKLAND  Rise Ambrose rise and share your master's joy which thus runs o'er  Wiping his eyes and gazing at the picture  It must be soIt was her former 'tis her present image Quick let me fly then to this fair transformed kiss off the pearly drops from her pale cheek and dry them with the warmest sighs of love clasp those imploring hands and press that heaving bosom to my heart  Exit  AMBROSE  May heaven be praised for this most blest event I shall see my dearest lord and lady happy once more and then I've lived enough  Exit  SCENE  changes to Lady  FRANKLAND  's dressing room she sitting leaning on her arm the ornaments of her head taken off  Lady FRANKLAND  With what impatience have I told the minutes since I deemed it possible Lord Frankland might have seen the picture Ambrose perhaps deceived me He may not look upon it or if he should how am I sure that he will turn his eyes on me But should he even despise my sorrows and leave me to my fate I ought not to complain But 'tis impossibleI know his generous heart will melt at my distress At least he sure will pity and forgive  Enter  Lord FRANKLAND  and stands at the side of the scene gazing at her  Lord FRANKLAND  My bounding heart springs from my breast to meet herHow beautiful she looks and Oh how exquisite those charms which even the veil of sorrow cannot shade  Lady FRANKLAND  Heavens  Looking at him and falling back in her chair  Lord FRANKLAND  Is then the dearest fairest of her sex again restored to the fond heart and arms of her adoring husband  Runs to catch her in his arms and embrances her  Lady FRANKLAND  Oh if not held unworthy of that blessing her wishes are complete  Lord FRANKLAND  Unworthy said you you never were nor could be so through all the winding maze of gaiety and youth my eyes have followed still their darling object nor has my heart one moment ceased to love to pity and esteem you Had the charms of pleasure or the snares of vice infatuated your heart that heart would ne'er have sighed to turn  again to me When I was first flattered at receiving the possession of it with that fair hand I claimed it as an husband's rightI now accept it as a generous gift and set the higher value on the prize  Lady FRANKLAND  Alas my lord your tenderness and generosity overpower meThey are indeed much more than I deserve yet though blushing for my follies let me say no crime has rendered me unworthy of your goodnessMy heart is free from stain and henceforth I may hope thy image there shall shield it from all future weakness  Lord FRANKLAND  Can you suppose I doubt it while with transports such as those I clasp it to my own  Embraces her  Enter  EMILIA  EMILIA  My dear Lady Erankland joy like mine is not to be restrained by common formsLucy this moment told me she saw Lord Frankland come into your dressing room and though perhaps I interrupt your happiness I must indulge my own by wishing to you both that true felicity which I well know you both deserve  Lady FRANKLAND  The generous friend who has shared the sorrows of my heart has a right surely to partake its joys and if my present happiness could admit addition it must be found in that which my Emilia feels  Lord FRANKLAND  I know of nought that could increase my bliss but seeing you rejoice Emilia  Enter  LUCY  LUCY  Madam Sir William Belville is below and begs to speak with you immediately he says the cause of his intrusion at so late an hour will be a sufficient apology for it There is a servant of Mr Frankland's Patrick madam who says he has been at Lord Frankland's with a letter for him but his lordship was not at home  To Emilia  Lord FRANKLAND  They were mistaken Lucy for this is now my home  EMILIA  What shall I do Lady Frankland  Lady FRANKLAND  See him by all means Emilia There must be some uncommon cause for such an illtimed visit  Lord FRANKLAND  Desire him to walk in here Lucy every mark of politeness is due to his character  Exit Lucy  EMILIA  What business Mr Frankland's servant can have with Sir William or with me I can not imagine  Lady FRANKLAND  A little time will explain this mystery Emilia  Enter  Sir WILLIAM PATRICK  and  LUCY  Sir WILLIAM  I am extremely happy at finding your Lordship here as I am persuaded this meeting must render Lady Frankland and you so and as the affair which brings me hither concerns the honour of  your lordship's Family For which reason I meant to have waited on you at your house  Lord FRANKLAND  Sir William I am very glad to see you upon any occasion but I think I have as little to fear on the account you mention as any man for I happen not to be blest with any female relations but those ladies who now stand before you  Sir WILLIAM  Then my Lord you may indeed boast your having nothing to be alarmed at from feminine connections for if virtue and innocence were to become embodied and chuse their forms they would be those of Lady Frankland and EmiliaBut your lordship has I think a male relation counsellor Frankland  PATRICK  Augh that's my master now and faith myself is almost sorry I exposed him before such great company  Aside  Lord FRANKLAND  What of him Sir William I look upon him as a very honest sensible and sober young man rather too grave for one of his age  PATRICK  Augh hone how little he knows of him  Aside  Sir WILLIAM  I fear then you are deceived my lordThis honest simple fellow here his own servant this morning overheard a scheme laid between him and Fontange Lady Frankland's woman for no less than the absolute ruin of this lady  Pointing to Emilia  EMILIA  Heavens how I tremble  Lord FRANKLAND  I am unwilling to think so vilely of human nature in any instance and much more so of Charles Frankland in particular as to suppose this to be true What proof can you produce friend that such a villainy was e'er intended  To Patrick  PATRICK  Upon my safe conscience my lord my own two ears heard them talk about it in my master's chambers and that ugly jade that madame Fontange was to get a good thousand pounds for assisting him in carrying her off  Lord FRANKLAND  I cannot be persuaded that Charles is such a villain  PATRICK  Why my lord if he is not in the house this very instant why then Patrick's a lyar and never believe him more Aughhone myself is sorry enough for his doing such a bad thing and it would break my heart to see him go to Tyburn for it among a parcel of dirty blackguard highwaymen that would lose their life for five or six guineas and not among gentlemen like himself that would be hanged for killing their friend in a fair quarrel or running handsomely away with their mistress But upon my own soul though it would be a thousand pities to ruin that sweet creture for all that  Lord FRANKLAND  If Charles be found in the house Emilia I fear the rest of the story is then too true Yet as the crime has not been perpetrated I would wish to save him both from the shame as well as the  punishment he deserves I will go search and bring him from his hold  Sir WILLIAM  I request your lordship will allow me and this honest fellow to attend you if it be only to approve our truth  Lord FRANKLAND  By no means Sir William your honour has been proved sufficiently in the detection His servants honesty shall be rewarded  Exit  PATRICK  Great luck to your lordship  EMILIA  How is it possible Sir William to repay this service  Sir WILLIAM  I shall ever consider it as the greatest happiness of my life that it has been in my power to render you any madam and if it might not appear to be presuming too much upon the present incident I should intreat you to accept all the future services of my life I rejoice to find your ladyship has led the way into the only path to real happiness  To lady Frankland  Lady FRANKLAND  I have not the least doubt of your generosity Sir William and shall ever be ready with true gratitude to own my obligations  Sir WILLIAM  If your ladyship thinks you have any 'tis in your power to overpay them now by joining me to request the fair Emilia to accept my hand and heart Both your ladyship and I have seen the error of imagining they can be separated  Lady FRANKLAND  I allow it Sir William and as I know no person so capable of rendering my Emilia happy I entreat  EMILIA  My dear lady Frankland I will not make a merit of granting that to your request which I think Sir William's own deserts have a right to claim  Sir WILLIAM  The generous manner of conferring would if possible double the obligation  Enter Lord  FRANKLAND  Lord FRANKLAND  I have secured the poor unhappy wretch to save him from himself  Sir WILLIAM  Then it was true my lord  Lord FRANKLAND  Too true Sir I made his vile accomplice trembling and scared convey me to the place where he lay concealed but when he saw me stand before him guilt and confusion flashed into his faceHe thought it was an apparition and stiffened quite with horror I closed upon him instantly and seized the pistols which lay by his side He then fell on his knees confessed his crime and begged that I would give him from my hand that death which he deserved  EMILIA  I grieve to think my lord this happy hour should have been interrupted by such a sad event  Lord FRANKLAND  'Tis rather sure an addition to my bliss that you are saved from misery EmiliaBut to Sir William Belville your first and greatest thanks are due  EMILIA  If he is not satisfied with my payments my lord he must e'en take out a statute of bankruptcy against me for I have already surrendered to him every thing I was mistress of  Lord FRANKLAND  Then I give him joy with all my heart  EMILIA  As for you honest Patrick I think the least return I can make you for saving my life and ho+nour is to present you with the same sum that Fontange was to have had for destroying both  PATRICK  Heaven bless and prosper your ladyship for that Patrick will carry it into his own country and that itself would be a help to poor Ireland for every one has a pluck at it and would be glad to take all they can get from it and no body never gives it nothing at all  Enter  NICODEMUS  with a letter to  Lord FRANKLAND  NICODEMUS  One of your servants has just brought this from your lordship's house he says the man who gave it him bid him carry it whereever you were if he should not meet with your honour at home  Exit  Lord FRANKLAND  Have I permission  They all bow and he opens the letter and looks at the bottom  From Clarinda  reads the letter  Malicious woman Oh let the venomed shaft with which she meant to wound my tenderest part now lodge in her own breast  Aside  Gives the letter to Lady Frankland  You see my dear I had sufficient cause to warn you against this dangerous woman and I am pleased to find that her resentment has arisen from your kind attention to my desire in forbidding her your house  Exit  Lady FRANKLAND  This fortunate deliverance with every other successful event of my future life may add to my happiness but cannot increase that love and gratitude with which my heart o'erflows to thee its generous protector and its surest guide  Enter  NICODEMUS  NICODEMUS  Please your ladyship mademoiselle has got out of the window of the room where his lordship left her thoa I'se have the key safe enough in my pocketShall I go after and lug her back  Lord FRANKLAND  No let the wretch escape the disappointment of her avarice be the punishment of her crime but henceforth I intreat my dearest wife will never employ foreigners again while there are persons in our own country both in trade and service sufficient to supply our uses  Lady FRANKLAND  In this and every thing else my pride and pleasure shall be to obey my dearest lord  Too plainly have I prov'd that unconfin'd  Our little skiff is toss'd by every wind  On rocks and quicksands often is it cast  And frequent sunk by cruel slander's blast  But when our pilot at the helm appears  With steady hand and compass when he steers  In full security we sail with ease  And fear nor driving winds nor raging seas  FINIS  EPILOGUE  The Writer unknown  Enter  Mrs Clive  with an  EPILOGUE  in her Hand  OH I am sick with laughingalmost dead  Well sure of all the epilogues I ever read  This is the dullest ah that head that head  Such flimsy poor quaint trash was never penn'd  And what's still worse he stiles himself  a friend  I wish he'd be his own and cease to write  I vow the  Christmas
