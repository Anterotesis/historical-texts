 THE CESTUS A SERENATA  PERFORMED AT THE ROYAL CIRCUS IN St GEORGE's FIELDS MDCCLXXXIII  THE CESTUS A SERENATA  CHARACTERS  JUPITER  Master Sestini  MARS  Miss Simonet  VENUS  Miss Wilkinson  IRIS  Miss Seymour  JUNO  Miss Romanzini  SCENE  The Audience Hall of  JUPITER  AIR  JUPITER  THE Phoenix we're told has the Sun for his sire  That he lives to five cent'ries or more  That he then gathers gums and reeds in good store  With these makes a fire  In the midst of which fire being seated  His wings are the bellows  Which kindle it up till 'tis properly heated  And farther they tell us  When no longer in flame this combustible flashes  A spick and span new one jumps out of the ashes  Another wise tale to a dragon gave birth  Whose teeth it is said were but sown in the earth  When 'tis gravely attested and let who will smile  That a regiment of soldiers appear'd rank and file  These stories 'tis granted are very absurd  No man ever saw such a dragon or bird  Yet folly and love to be met with asunder  I hold a phenomenon of such a kind  A rarity so much more worthy to brag on  That sooner than set out this wonder  To find  I'd be bound to produce you both phoenix and dragon  RECITATIVE  JUPITER  In short there's no such thing as bearing on't  Her vixen tongue gains strength by wearing on't  Like Camomile or old Anteus  Why we're the jest of all who see us  The jibe of every wag sarcastic  But to the Court Ecclesiastic  I'll cite her for good reasons various  And there get licence to unmarry us  MARS  What you 'tis all a flam how often  At a sham tear we've seen you soften  And while her shower has still'd your thunder  Glad was your godship to knock under  JUPITER  Mars your reproach I feel too sensible  Why Sir it is incomprehensible  How she has rul'd mehow I've buckl'd  And like a Jerry crept and truckl'd  And shall I bear't no this fond Cupid here  Will I shake off Arouse thee Jupiter  Were this of heaven to be the etiquette  Where Jove thus govern'd by a petticoat  Witlings would soon lampoon in puny verse  The henpeck'd master of the universe  JUNO  Iris  JUPITER  D'ye hear  JUNO  Howout to supper  JUPITER  Zounds here she is hard at your crupper  MARS  You'll stand my friend  JUNO  Where is your master  MARS  The storm comes on thicker and faster  JUNO  O'my life this night he'll make a tapermeal  JUPITER  D'ye hear her clack goes like a papermill  Thunder the sea or fifty coaches  MARS  Stand to your arms the soe approaches  JUNO  So Sir without my leave you're going out  JUPITER  Come Madam Juno don't be throwing out  These airs  JUNO  Why numscull sirrah sniveler  D'ye know whom 'tis you talk to driveler  JUPITER  A fury fiend a very devil  Is that right  MARS  Bravo  JUNO  Mighty civil  Do take his part a pretty nest of you  But soon repent it shall the best of you  First I'll demolish all your glasses  Sotting and toasting filthy lasses  Only to set your heads a swimming  With plots to wrong us honest women  JUPITER  Will you be quiet  BACCHUS  Save the pieces  JUNO  I'll claw you  MARS  Zounds the storm encreases  AIR  I'm up to all your tricks my dear  How the winds you make your letters bear  My care and vigilence to queer  But little are you winning  You know 'tis true my pretty youth  You send 'em East West North and South  Don't laughlest t'other side your mouth  You should be after grinning  You Master don't believe it love  I'm Juno still and you are Jove  Whom Fate has plac'd me far above  Nor her decrees could'st alter  Then yield with grace the sovereign rule  Nor think to make me thus a tool  For those who hang me for a fool  Will find a knave in the halter  JUPITER  Plague vixen wretch that tongue confounded  Cease for a moment  JUNO  Rage unbounded  Choaks up my voicemy tongue forbids me  JUPITER  Madam I am resolv'd to rid me  Of tongue face person altogether  And since for love nor duty neither  Your wayward mind can't find a place in't  We'll part whate'er be th' disgrace in't  JUNO  Yes yes one's fame is easy mangled  By words high sounding and new fangled  Periods with ornaments and scollops  I know you're going to your trollops  JUPITER  'Twixt you and truth there is no fitness  Had you been kinder heav'n's my witness  Not all the Ledas Ios Semeles  Or other of those numerous families  I've had to do with low and royal  Had won me to an act disloyal  But now 'tis o'er I give you warning  We part Ma'am and tomorrow morning  AIR  Think not here to drive your gig  Madam Juno  I'll make you know  Who's at home or burn my wig  Why I'll know the reason  You may grin but I'll bet twenty  Her Lord and Master  I shall cast her  And as to witnesses I've plenty  In good time and season  Shall I by hermy goods and chattels  Be led by the nose her  Nor dispose her  As I listWhy Sir these battles  'Gainst me are petty treason  IRIS  Why Ma'am what is all this  JUNO  I'm moonstruck  Have I my senses ah too soon struck  My wretched ears the unwelcome tidings  Tomorrow part plague take all chidings  Anger reproaches scoldings hectorings  Taunts sneers hard words and curtain lecturings  IRIS  Why for the past 'tis past ne'er think on't  You're now near ruin  JUNO  On the brink on't  IRIS  Let us then try ere yet it catch ye  From this same precipice to snatch ye  JUNO  But how dear Iris how  IRIS  Have patience  As generals be what will their stations  Think it both politic and wise  Deserters to employ and spies  So you by way of go between us  Shall in this case employ dame Venus  For if she lend you but her zone  The charms of love are all your own  AIR  With that begirt each dowdy girl  Gets every charm does she but ask it  Her teeth become a row of pearl  Enclos'd within a coral casket  Carnations bloom upon her cheeks  Roses take place of blotch and pimple  The air's perfum'd whene'er she speaks  And Cupids play in every dimple  RECITATIVE  JUNO  Don't name the wretch  IRIS  Set a good face  O' th' matter Ma'am yours is no case  One cures by any thing one pleases  Physic for desperate d  seases  Must desperate be Ma'am  JUNO  I'll assure you  Miss Boldfacewhat d'ye mean  IRIS  To cure you  Better than nostrums can or simples  Where's this same queen of smiles and dimples  AIR  VENUS  Who calls on her whose powerful art  Erects a throne in every heart  Whose love all court whose anger fear  Venus ycleptbehold her here  Sighs some fond youth his love unkind  Wou'd he some watchful Argus blind  Glows some fair virgin's modest cheek  With wishes that she dare not speak  RECITATIVE  VENUS  How can the humble queen of love  The powerful wife of thundering Jove  In ought obligespeak mighty Juno  JUNO  I'm told good woman as how you know  To gain men's hearts that you can win 'em  And as you list to th' grindstone pin 'em  Now you must know all in a whiff  My spoute and I have had a tiff  And now the villain talks of parting  Oh it will break my heart for certain  VENUS  Patience dear Ma'am  JUNO  'Twill all come home to hi  â–ª  I know not what the devil's come to him  With his fine fiats and his ordeals  But t'other day he broke my cordials  And sorely did my patience handle  Because I talk'd a little scandal  AIR  JUNO  ine sport indeed for god and godlin  To see great Jove become Moll Codlin  And threat his wife with fist and horsewhip  Because she loves a little gossip  Yet he forsooth can trot and amble  And after scores of misses ramble  Leave gods at Hercules your grinning  The master of the world's a spinning  Though while such worthy work is doing  Slap goes the universe to ruin  The trumpet sounds wars wide and civil  Convulse the earth while to the devil  They go their own wayand no wonder  His light'ning's outasleep his thunder  RECITATIVE  VENUS  Well Madam would you be as blest as  I am in love but wear this Cestus  Which with observance of your duty  Will turn deformity to beauty  JUNO  A pinch of snuff or dram did'st give me  Thou could'st not half so well revive me  My dungeon's chang'd into a palace  Thou hast repriev'd me at the gallows  Thy words are cabbage to starved taylors  Or calms to poor exhausted sailors  While winds and billows are in rumptions  Or gold to pockets in consumptions  Now let him dare take any word ill  Come help me on with this same girdle  VENUS  Yet take methey have but pretext to't  Who mark not well the charm annex'd to't  Your husband's now on some vagary  When he comes home pray be you wary  Whatever riot he may kick up  However stagger swear or hiccup  You do not speak one single syllable  If you should find these terms fulfilable  You're sure that instant to reclaim him  Heaven shall a rake no longer name him  But setting taunts and wordy war by  Juno and Jove prove Joan and Darby  JUNO  Thou'rt rightmore happy than a king am I  I thank you kindly Mrs Thingamy  AIR  JUNO  Hear the merry minstrel sound  On the ear it rings  While all the strings  Are one entire vibration  The tinkling pleasure spreads around  And as it plays  Sweetly conveys  From sense to sense  Soft eloquence  In thrilling circulation  But stringless broken out of tune  Time's thrown away  For did you play  Without the least cessation  And strum from January till June  You still may bang  At every twang  The dismal hum  The more you thrum  Speaks but its mutilation  Just so let down its pegs the heart  In sadness sits  Nor once admits  Of any consolation  But screw it into tune each smart  And anxious care  Dissolves to air  Alone its joys  The mind employs  And all is jubilation  RECITATIVE  Lord Lord I never saw her feller  One minute in the garret next in the cellar  To blow both hot and cold she's able  Just like the satyr in the fable  VENUS  No wonderjealousy's a viris  Numbs and corrodes the passions Iris  But I'll be off and at a distance  Watch lest they need from me assistance  Should my scheme take should noise and riot  Yield here in heav'n to peace and quiet  Scolding once shut out from our portals  Who knows that plague may cease 'mongst mortals  AIR  Our Jupiter has near his Throne  Two vessels which he fills  The one with benefits alone  The other crams with ills  From the good vessel health content  Plenty and bliss he gives  While from the evil forth are sent  Gout stone and scolding wives  II  Thus to mankind with heedful care  In just proportion weigh'd  The lot to each each best can bear  By Jove's decrees convey'd  Unless his patience when to rub  Juno the devil drives  Then headlong from the lefthand tub  Go troops of scolding wives  III  Oft this complaint on me like air  From men still pass'd away  Till that same Madam Juno there  Let loose her tongue today  But now intreating Jove I'll go  To chequer not their lives  With any other spot of woe  Who're plagued with scolding wives  RECITATIVE  IRIS  If to have pomp and greatness this 'tis  Rather than live the life of my mistress  Rather than thus for ever jingle  By Jingo I'd for one live single  Nor be in splendid misery kept here  For coif and crook change crown and sceptre  The spheres that the ear so sweetly splits  For thrushes blackbirds and tomtits  AIR  How happy she who ne'er can know  The misery of the great  Who far from reach of scepter'd woe  Finds in her low estate  Joy in her innocencedelight  In scenes that still present  Pleasures that health and strength excite  And transport in content  II  One brook her mirror and her drink  The happy wanderer seeks  And as her lambs play round its brink  Good Nature paints her cheeks  Few are her wants certain her joy  For Reason's glad consent  Points out her innocent employ  And guides her to content  RECITATIVE  JUPITER  Yes yes 'tis the only way to nick her  And yet tho' fortified with liquor  Though halfseas o'er I'll not dissemble  The very thoughts on't makes me tremble  But come be firm my heart for meet 'tis  Ere Phoebus rise from lap of Thetis  When on nights glims I've put the extinguisher  This wife of mine that I reliquish her  Oh what delight in joy to roll me  Without a creature to control me  When from my wife I shall be parted  And yetno pangs no fears fainthearted  Compunction doubts fly far away  And let Jove sing  Tit fal de ray  AIR  JUPITER  I've seen a bear who long did puzzle  To loose from's mouth an ugly muzzle  I've seen a linnet vent its rage  In vainly fluttering 'gainst its cage  I've seen snar'd lionsAy a score  While forests trembled at their roar  I was the bear  The lion the linnet  I was caught in a snare  And while I was in it  Oh how did I roar and flutter and puzzle  To get rid of the cage the net and the muzzle  And yet knew not how  But now  My wings are at liberty so are my jaws  Uncumber'd by net I can put out my paws  And my unfetter'd limbs all so nimble advance  That I think I could join in a country dance  No longer I roar or flutter or puzzle  I have thrown off the snare the cage and the muzzle  And am nowOh ye powers what rapture propose  The bear the lion the linnetlet loose  JUPITER  But hold I hear no creature stir  Who waits within thereIris  IRIS  Sir  JUPITER  What wonder's this I hear no riot  The storm is hushed my house is quiet  One may perceive the foftest head  Why sure your lady is not dead  IRIS  Dead Heaven forbidno you'll not bury  Her this bout she's alive and merry  JUPITER  And silentthen will I be halter'd  IRIS  Why Sir you see the case is alter'd  JUPITER  Nay nay explain these ha's and hums  IRIS  Let her explain them here she comes  JUPITER  She's sulky nowah sulk'twon't hurt you  Psha you're a foolhow's this a courtsey  The Trick's too stale to pass 'tis vile  This calm forbodes a storma smile  Well this is strange she's lost her tongue  Which else ere this a peal had rung  'Tis so I'faithwhat sweet surprize  Juno how do'stshe's charming eyes  Cupids inhabit there a score  I never notic'd this before  If we go on thus on my life  I shall grow fond of my own wife  VENUS  Soit works rarely  JUPITER  How's this Venus  She knows not sure what passed between us  Come you our pleasures to destroy Ma'am  VENUS  Not I indeed Sirgive you joy Ma'am  'Tis done and you may silence break  Juno shakes her head  Oh there's no fear of thatcome speak  JUPITER  She can't  VENUS  O yes she can  JUPITER  Come come  You're jesting  VENUS  No  JUPITER  What an't she dumb  JUNO  Yes Dumb and blind deaf and insensible  Held by an influence indispensible  To loath and scorn beyond all measure  Those joys that do not give you pleasure  AIR  Meek I'll be as Venus' dove  Your presence court your absence mourn  Love shall be the price of love  And kindness ask a kind return  Folly shall ne'er my mind defile  From prudence will I ne'er depart  My face shall wear a constant smile  And duty govern in my heart  RECITATIVE  VENUS  Thus have we proved it never happens  That ornament and outward trappings  Can make on the heart the least impression  Much less secure a fix'd possession  Our Jove here has been long time married  Yet his wife's fondness had miscarried  Each thing in life she did was wrong  Until she kindlyheld her tongue  Learn hence that husbands will be blind  To every beauty but the mind  Great Venus  there  should hold her court  There  should the Loves and Graces sport  There  rapture beam'd in every feature  Bound by that Cestus called  Good Nature  AIR  Come away then and take an example here  Above below and all who have seen us  For plain to your senses it soon shall appear  That rich and poor  Who true bliss would ensure  Lest they meet with miscarriage  Must remember in marriage  Good Nature's the Cestus of Venus  JUNO  Resign'd to my duty at last  Resolv'd to repent what is past  Every folly and fault to give o'er  I now open my eyes  And my only surprize  Is I never yet thought on't before  VENUS  'Tis a noble resolve  May the stars in their spheres  For millions of years  Still find you each time they revolve  To your husband's faults blinder  He kinder and kinder  Till Juno and Jove  Are envied below and above  END OF THE CESTUS
