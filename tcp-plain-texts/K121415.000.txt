 JONATHAN WILD  THE LIFE OF JONATHAN WILD FROM HIS BIRTH to his DEATH  CONTAINING His Rise and Progress in ROGUERY his first Acquaintance with THIEVES by what Arts he made himself their HEAD or GOVERNOR his Discipline over them his Policy and great Cunning in governing them and the several Classes of THIEVES under his Command  In which all his INTRIGUES PLOTS and ARTIFICES are accounted for and laid open  To which is added A true COPY of a PAPER design'd to be deliver'd by him at the Place of Execution to the Reverend Mr  Edwards    Intermix'd with Variety of diverting STORIES  The Second EDITION  By H D late Clerk to Justice  LONDON  Printed for T WARNER at  Black Boy  in  PaternosterRow  Price One Shilling  THE PREFACE  _THE Account which the Reader will here find of the most extraordinary ROGUE that ever yet Suffer'd in  England  was pick'd up for the most Part at several Times from his own Relations and Stories of himself which are the best Authorities that can be produced for Things which according to the Iniquity and Nature of them were transacted with such extreme Caution  And it is certain that the greatest Part of his dark Proceedings wou'd still have continu'd a Secret to the World had it not been that in his gay Hours when his Heart was open he took Pleasure in recounting his past Rogueries and with a great deal of Humour bragg'd of his biting the World often hinting not without Vanity at the poor Understanding of the greatest Part of Mankind and his own superior Cunning  And indeed when we consider that it is not a Man's Grandeur or high Station in the World but the strange Adventures of his Life and his Art and Conduct in the Management of Things which gives us a Curiosity of looking into his HistoryI say when this is granted we need make no Apology for collecting these Materials and offering them to the Publickfor here they will meet with a System of Politicks unknown to  Machiavel  they will see deeper  Stratagems and Plots form'd by a Fellow without Learning or Education than are to be met with in the Conduct of the greatest Statesman who have been at the Heads of Governments  And indeed when Things are rightly compared it will be found that he had a more difficult Game to play for he was to blind the Eyes of the World to find out Tricks to evade the Penalties of the Law and on the other Side to govern a Body of People who were Enemies to all Government and to bring those under Obedience to him who at the Hazard of their Lives acted in Disobedience to the Laws of the LandThis was steering betwixt  Scylla  and  Charybdis  and if he had not been a very skilful Pilot he must long since have split upon a Rock either on one Side or the other  To conclude We have not taken so much Pains to multiply a Number  of Stories which wou'd have swell'd the Bulk of these Sheets and increas'd the Price and perhaps tired the Reader we have only endeavour'd to trace him thro' his several Steps and Gradations to account for the Policy and Cunning of his Management and relating only such Facts as have not yet been made publick concerning him  PS  As to the Paper he left behind him and which we have annex'd to this Edition it was given me by a Person who being of his Acquaintance was admitted frequently to his Company after his Conviction and which he assures me he had from his own Hands the Reverend Gentleman there mentioned whom I know nothing of can best tell whether he had such a Design of communicating himself to the Publick in that manner and there I leave it  THE LIFE OF  JONATHAN WILD  From his BIRTH to his DEATH  _JONATHAN WILD  was born of very honest Parents in the Town of  Wolverhampton  in the County of  Stafford  His Father was not rich however he provided handsomly for his Family while he lived by his Trade which was that of a Carpenter But he dying and  leaving four or five small Children for the Widow to bring up and subsist 'tis no wonder if their Education was no better taken Care of As for  Jonathan  he shew'd early Signs of a forward Genius and whilst a Boy would commit a thousand little Rogueries among those of the same or a superior Class in which he discovered a ready Wit and a Cunning much above his Years tho' these Actions did not extend to robbing or any such Crime but I mean little collusive Tricks which serv'd to impose upon his own Companions who had a less Faculty of discerning than  Jonathan  had  At the usual Age when young  Jonathan  had been instructed to a moderate Degree of Learning such as Writing and Accounts he was put 'Prentice to a Bucklemaker whom he serv'd seven Years honestly enough when that Time was expired he carry'd on a little peddling Business himself in the same Way but  Jonathan  wanted Application which is generally observ'd to be the Fault of Men of brisk Parts Work and he were too much at Variance for him to thrive by his Trade he seem'd to follow it only at a Distance often playing the Loose wandering from one Alehouse to another with the very worst tho' the merriest Company in the Place and was particularly fond of the strolling Actors that now and then frequented that Country  After this Manner  Jonathan  liv'd three or four Years leading a Life of Pleasure disturb'd with nothing unless it was now and then at the Noise of a Drum which he had as great Antipathy to as some Folks to Cheese or a Cat This was in the Heighth of the late War between  France  and the Confederates when the Officers went down into the several Counties for Recruits for  Flanders  for which Kind of Service Mr  Wild  had perhaps more Aversion than for any other Thing in Life this was not for want of Courage as we shall prove in the Course of his History but he thought a Man of Stratagem might push his Fortune some better Way than by standing to be shot at and therefore 'twas necessary that he should employ the utmost Cunning to avoid it which however  Jonathan  could never have done but by a Trick which he was more beholden to Nature for than Art this was a Knack of dislocating his Hipbone which he could do without Pain and thereby render himself a Cripple and repose it in its Place again without Trouble whenever he pleas'd this was particularly useful to him and which he constantly perform'd whenever his unlucky Stars brought him within Sight of a red Coat which he us'd to pass by in so decrepid and deform'd a Posture as never fail'd to move Pity in the Beholders towards so miserable an Object and he was no sooner out of Sight of 'em  but he walk'd as upright and as firm as any Man  In the Course of  Jonathan  's Trading he visited some MarketTowns to put off his Wares as other Dealers did at which Time he us'd to hire a Horse of his Neighbour's for  Jonathan  's Stock would not amount to one of his own and at a certain Time when Trade grew bad on his Hands he sells his whole Cargoe for what he could get and rides up the Horse to  London  instead of returning home to  Wolverhampton  and the Owner heard nothing of his Beast till 'twas sold and all the Money spent  While  Jonathan  was spending in Gaiety and Pleasure the little Fortune he had acquir'd by the Sale of his own Stock and his Neighbour's Horse he got acquainted with several Persons of both Sexes who were People of Merit in their Way by whose Interest and the Vivacity of his own Parts he was recommended to an Employment of Trust in which he acquitted himself very handsomely considering the Corruption of the Times but after a while  Jonathan  finding it rather a Post of Honour than Profit resign'd and went down into his own Country again The Employment I mean is that of a Bailiff's Follower the Qualifications of which are Vigilance Sagacity Patience Quicksightedness  cum multis aliis  which our  Jonathan  had frequent Opportunities of exercising  One of the first Visiters  Jonathan  had upon his Return to  Wolverhampton  was Mr who lent him his Horse to whom he open'd his Case letting him know that he was not one Farthing the richer by living at  London  that he had spent every Groat and if he threw him into Prison he would lose his Money but that if he would favour him so as to give him Time he would pay for his Horse at a Shilling in the Pound  per  Month till the whole was paid and he should apply himself with Assiduity to his own Business to enable him to make good these Conditions which the Creditor considering came into and so the Agreement was made  Mr  Wild  pursuant to the above Terms made two Payments at the Time they became due but neglecting the third for a Fortnight or three Weeks Mr gave  Jonathan  a gentle Dun telling him at what time the Month was up and so forth but was very much surpriz'd to find that Mr  Wild  was so far from making any Excuse for his Omission that he told him plainly he should pay him no more Money and wonder'd at his Assurance of making Demands on him  Why  says the Creditor  did not you run away with my Horse sell him at  London  and put the Money in your own Pocket I did so  answered  Jonathan but that affair was settled by an Agreement between  us that I should pay you so much Money by Monthly Payments in Consideration thereof therefore that Cause is at an End Very well  reply'd the Creditor  why don't you pay me according to that Contract then No  quoth  Jonathan that Contract is obsolete and of none effect How so  says the Creditor  Why you'll allow  says  Jonathan that Articles of Agreement or Contracts not fulfill'd are broken and Articles once broken cannot subsist afterwards Now our Articles are broken  continued he  for I have made but two Payments when there are three due long ago therefore I owe you nothing    I mention this Story to shew that  Jonathan  had a Genius for the Study of the Law and had not his Practice taken another Turn at first I don't know whether better or worse as it is practised of late he might have been as eminent and made as great a Figure as some of his Countrymen  It was not long after this that  Jonathan  found the making of Buckles too mechanick an Employment for him his Soul was too great to be confin'd to such servile Work and what was worse he easily perceiv'd he had Occasion for more Money than his Hands could procure him in that narrow Way of Business therefore he spurn'd at the Trade and resolv'd some how or other to transfer the Labour from his Hands to his Head as being the most likely Means of getting a Livelihood fit for a Gentleman  Big with Hopes he set out for  London  once more but as if he threw himself entirely upon Fortune and resolved to court her Favours he begun his Journey on foot and with no more than nine Pence in his Pocket and the first Day he was so lucky as to meet with the Goddess in the same shape the Poets describe her  viz  That of a Woman travelling on the Road The Lady was on Horseback but however she was so goodnatur'd as to let  Jonathan  keep Pace with her for three or four Miles till by a little Conversation they grew intimate and acquainted with each other's Circumstances She told  Jonathan  she was an itinerant Doctress and cur'd People of all Distempers that she had been riding about the Country for the Good of the Publick and was then going to  Gloucester  whereupon  Jonathan  being in a merry Humour ask'd her Opinion concerning his Leg and Thigh which he presently put out in the manner before mentioned the Gentlewoman alighted from her Horse and handling  Jonathan  's Parts she found his Hipbone was out of its Socket a great Exuberance on the back Part thereof and his Knee and Foot turn'd almost behind him  She was amazed to see this sudden Alteration without being sensible of the Cause and was very much troubled to know what she should do with the poor Fellow in that Condition but  Jonathan  presently put her  out of Pain desired her to mount her Horse and he would accompany her into Town He thereupon replaces the Joint and walks along before her with great Briskness and Agility When she was thoroughly inform'd of the Trick she intimated how useful this Deceit might be made to them both if he would leave it to her Management and all the Trouble he should be at was to lie a Bed for a Fortnight and eat and drink whatever he had a mind to Upon which she let him into a Secret that she knew no more of Physick or Surgery than her Horse and only pretended to it for a Livlihood  It may be imagin'd that  Jonathan  was not difficult to be wrought on to such good Purposes for he was never an Enemy to Eating and drinking in his whole Life accordingly the Plan was laid and  Jonathan  hopp'd into Town in the Evening in the Circumstances of a poor decriped Beggarman  The Doctress set up at the best Inn in  Gloucester  ask'd for a Room and call'd the Landlord telling him she found a poor miserable Object upon the Road that ask'd Alms of her which she presently relieved seeing him in a Condition that render'd him useless to the World and burthensome to himself adding that since he might be able if his Lameness could be cured to get an honest Livlyhood by his Labour 'twas a Thousand Pities he should not be taken Care of  The Landlord could say nothing to that 'twas the Parish's Business where he was born he said who should take Care of him says she if you have any eminent Surgeon in Town a Man of Honour and Probity that will undertake his Cure I will be at the Expence of it my self and give him a suitable Reward The Landlord Commended her Ladiship's Charity and  Jonathan  pray'd aloud for his Benefactress  On Mr  B  a Surgeon was sent for to whom Madam declared her self in like manner and the Surgeon took a Survey before all the House of the Part affected He saw the Nature of his Lameness and therefore only ask'd  Jonathan  how long ago this Misfortune happen'd to him He answered in a whining Tone  About eight Years  and thereupon relates a plausible Story of his falling off a Tree in a Country Village where no help was to be met with and his Mother being a poor Woman had not wherewithall to pay a Doctor and the like but pretended to be very much cast down when the Surgeon addressing himself to the Gentlewoman said  Madam it would be no less than a Robbery to take your Money for there's no possibility of serving him the Bone having been so long misplac'd has contracted a new Situation and the Head of the Bone has formed a new Socket so formidable that 'twould be unnatural now to remove it thence  so that we must let it rest as it is  This did not seem to satisfy the Gentlewoman she was sure she said  the Limb might be reduc'd to its proper Place with Care taken if he would apply Fomentations and other topical Medicines to the Part for the Relaxation of the Ligaments  c  in Preparation for the Reduction  This was disputed some Time with Warmth between the Male and the Female Surgeon till it ended as often Arguments do in a Wager of fifty Guineas and the Lady her self was to take the Matter into her own Hands  Whereupon the Patient was blooded and then put ito a warm Bed Stupes were made of a thousand Herbs and the Fomentation apply'd or pretended so to be several times a Day Mr  B  visited him once in twenty four Hours and the Gentlewoman continued with him all the while for ten Days together in which time honest  Jonathan  acted his Part so well that he roar'd himself hoarse for the Pain he underwent as it was thought in this Extraordinary Operation At length one Morning as Mr B the Surgeon our Quack Doctress and three or four of the Town for the Affair had made some Noise were coming up Stairs they heard the Patient instead of groaning and making other dismal Cries as he us'd to do singing whistling and what not so they all burst into his Chamber and presently  ask'd the Occasion of his Mirth  Jonathan  told them he never knew so much Pleasure in all his Lifetime for now he said he was as free from Pain as ever a one in the Room  The sly Doctress desir'd to be inform'd how and at what time the Pain left him He answer'd that  about three a Clock that Morning not having slept for four Nights before he fell into a Dose and dream'd that two Angels lifted him out of Bed and carried him thro' several Regions of which he could give no Account and set him down upon a fine Bank of Flowers on the Side of a Rivulet on the other Side of which were beautiful Walks pleasant Groves and curious Waterworks and in the Center of all a Pavillion of Ivory of extraordinary Workmanship particularly the Sculpture the Roof was adorn'd with Birds of all kinds inlaid and on the Inside a Throne of pure Gold where sat his kind and good Benefactress At the Sight of her  continued  Jonathan I rose up in Haste thinking to swim the Rivulet when a Noise like Thunder awaken'd me and I found my self in this Bed in perfect Health and Ease  The cunning Gentlewoman cry'd out  at that Instant went the Bone into its Place  With that they turned down the Bedcloaths and found  Jonathan  a whole Man to the great Surprize of all the Company  This extraordinary Cure was look'd upon as a kind of Miracle Mr  B  believ'd it as such paid the Money  viz  fifty Guineas and clear'd the Case up to every Body from any Imputation of Deceit  Jonathan  in two or three Days came Abroad but limp'd a little and Madam Doctress gave publick Notice that she would stay a Week in that Town for the sake of the diseased Poor of the Country for whom she would make up some Papers of Powders that should cure them of all Disorders and make it the healthiest Part in the whole Kingdom for which she would take nothing of them but what the Medecines cost her out of her Pocket  according to the Cant of all Quacks    The News run like that of a great Victory gain'd over the  French  and  Spaniards  and People of all Conditions Age and Sexes came into  Gloucester  so that  Jonathan  could not pound Brickdust fast enough for Sale the Price of a small Paper of which with a Mixture of Brimstone and came but to six Pence  By this Stratagem the Woman's Fame was so rais'd that when  Jonathan  and she computed their Gains they found after all Charges were deducted that they were much about  l  in Pocket with which they set out early in the Morning and arriv'd at  London  safely in three Days following Here  Jonathan  liv'd a merry Life as long as the Money  lasted and being seduced by the Pleasures of the Town had no Thought of getting more till urg'd thereto by Necessity But now an unlucky Accident happen'd which seem'd to give an ill turn to his Affairs for his Lady  Doctress  took it into her Head to fall out with him whether it be that she was jealous of his having some new Amour for  Jonathan  was always a great Man amongst the Ladies or whether she could not bear his Extravagance is a piece of History we cannot clear up but let it be which it will there arose so furious a Quarrel betwixt them that  Jonathan  was laid aside and oblig'd to shift for himself He was after this Footman to one Mr  Daniel  a Barrister of Law in whose Service he spent some Time in which nothing remarkable happening we pass over in Silence A little Time after he was arrested in an Action of Debt and he being destitute both of Credit and Friends cou'd meet with no Body who would venture to bail him so that he was thrown into the  Compter  where he lay a considerable Time  Here  Jonathan  laid the Foundation of all his future Greatness for it must be observ'd that the  Compter  is the Place where common Thieves and Pickpockets taken in the City are first carried as soon as they are apprehended  Jonathan  took care to cultivate an Acquaintance and Intimacy with them all and as they are an enterprizing  Body of Men there seem'd to a kind of Sympathy betwixt their Natures and that of  Jonathan  so that they soon crept into one another's Secrets he became acquainted with all their Tricks and Stratagems and when the Iron Hand of Justice had laid hold of them and they were entangled in Difficulties he often put such Quirks and Evasions in their Heads and gave them such Advice as sometimes prov'd of great Advantage to them so that he became a kind of Oracle amongst the Thieves  After he had laid a considerable Time in the  Compter  he was assisted by a Friendly Gentleman in  LittleBritain  who getting a small Contribution among his Neighbours procur'd  Jonathan  's Liberty with it  He had now a numerous Acquaintance with whom he constantly associated these were the Thieves as has been before observed there was no Enterprize they went upon whether in Town or Country but they acquainted  Jonathan  with the Particulars of their Success what Booty they got and what Hazzards they run so communicative are these Gentlemen to those who keep them Company yet at the Beginning he had so much the Fear of the Gallows before his Eyes that they cou'd never prevail with him to go with them upon any Adventure and share in the executive Part  At first  Jonathan  drove but a poor pedling Trade only helping People to Writings which the Thieves cou'd make no Profit of and which cou'd be of no Use but to the Owners and in this he at first acted with such extream Caution for fear of coming within the Penalty of the Laws that after he had bargain'd with the People and they were come by his Appointment to pay the Money and receive the Writings he led them into a Room contriv'd for that Purpose where pushing back a small Pannel of the Wainscot a Hand us'd to appear with the Writings in it and the Parties were to take them out of that Hand and to put the Money into it without their seeing the Body which belonged to it so that they cou'd not say he had ever taken any of their Money or receiv'd the stolen Goods yet the Success and Encouragement he afterwards met with made him more careless to his great Sorrow  The first Thing that gave him any Fame was a Dispute he had with  Cornelius a Tilburgh  a noted Quack Doctor who being robb'd of some Goods and hearing of  Jonathan Wild  apply'd to him for the Recovery of them but after they had treated some Time they cou'd not agree about the Price upon the whole  Tilburgh  was vex'd he cou'd not have his Goods again and thinking  Jonathan  had them he arrests him in an  Action of Trover  Jonathan  gave bail to the Action and so a Suit of Law was commenced which was so well defended on  Jonathan  's side that the Doctor was nonsuited and Costs were given to  Jonathan    This gave him a great Reputation among his good Friends the Thieves who thought  Jonathan  the best Factor or Agent they cou'd employ so that his Business so increas'd that 'tis thought he got two or three hundred Pounds a Year by Commission  But it is no wonder he should thus by degrees increase in Business and in Fame for no Man grows great at once Having now engross'd the whole Traffick of stolen Goods to himself he became as useful to the Thieves as they were to him for now by his Credit they had a safe way of making Money of every Thing that fell into their Hands whereas before they run as great Hazzards of being discover'd and brought to Justice when they went about to dispose of their Goods as they did in stealing them  But as the Thieves first set him up only as their Factor he by degrees made himself their Master and their Tyrant he divided the City and Suburbs into Wards or Divisions and appointed the Persons who were to attend each Ward and kept them strictly to their Duty he also called them to a very exact Accuont and made them produce what they had got and tho' it were Money he  wou'd have his Dividend and it was no less than Death to  sink  upon him as he term'd it for there was scarce any Thing stole which was worth having again but he heard of it and knew who the Person must be that took it as well as those who lost it This is plain by what follows  Some time since the Dutchess of  Tyrconnel  being at Mass at the Chapel of his Excellency Count  Staremberg  in the  PallMall  her Grace in the Height of her Devotion had her Gold Watch stolen from her Side which was enter'd next Day in Mr  Wild  's Office who assur'd her Grace that the Business was perform'd by a regular Hand and therefore he doubted not the Recovery of it  Fox  alias  Vaux  a dextrous Fellow having his Station about  Westminsterhall  the Court of Requests and at the Cathedral and Parochial Churches  Wild  was assur'd must be the Man tho' he intending to bite  Jonathan  of his share denied it obstinately at first but Mr  Wild  using Menaces and threat'ning if he persisted to send him to his triangular Home he confess'd the Bill and  paid back  as the Thieves term it the Watch to the Dutchess for twenty five Guineas  However fond  Jonathan  appear'd to be of getting Money he shew'd a Generosity to his Friends not common with People who practise the Law of which I could give numberless Instances Particularly an Acquaintance of  his who lived in the  Mint  having lost a Gold Watch for there were Gold Watches there sometimes he paid back the Watch without one farthing Expence he return'd me a Pocket Book with some Notes of Value which I advertis'd in one of the Papers gratis but gave me this Caution  to keep better Company  And one Mr  Hll  then a Justice of the Peace told me that once going to a Country Fair he met  Jonathan  upon the Road who gave him a Watchword by using which he said if he met any of the  Prigs  that were out in these Hundreds he would pass safe Mr  Giles Taylor  a tall Attorney losing his Snuff Box he could not prevail with  Jonathan  to trouble himself about such trivial Things as he called it but Mr  Taylor  telling him he valued the Box and withal reminded him that he us'd to come with Briefs to his Master Counsellor  Daniel  whom he had the Honour to serve in the Quality of a Footman  O Sir  says  Wild I cry your Mercy you have given me many a Sixpence call in a Day or two and you shall have your Box again  which was accordingly left for him at a Tavern in the  OldBailey  without a Fee  The Wife of Mr  Chiselden  a famous Surgeon having been robb'd of a Diamond Buckle at the  Bath  Mr  Chiselden  together with a creditable Shopkeeper near the  OldBayley  waited on Mr  Wild  for his Advice  Wild  being very drunk receiv'd him with a great deal of Rudeness not usual with him but he signified the Cause of his Disgust to him for he told the Surgeon that he had dissected several honest Fellows that were his Friends and Acquaintance and that he should be dd before he should have his Buckle again which he assured him was dissected and divided amongst the jolly Fellows who had fairly ventured their Lives for it and so dismissed Mr  Chiselden    I mention these Instances to shew that  Jonathan  's Practice was fairer than some other Peoples and that he was capable of more honourable and friendly Actions than those that made so great a Noise of  their Charity their Generosity  c It is certain as the elegant Author of the  Weekly Journal  observes  Jonathan  hated these Pretenders to his Art and call'd them the Quacks of the Profession which every Science was pester'd with  One time an accident happen'd to a Gentlewoman at  Hackney  who us'd to let Lodgings A Lady who came attended by a Footman and a Maid took a Lodging in her House the first Day they had Possession of it they broke open a Scrutore belonging to the Gentlewoman of the House which was full of Chince and Muslin and very dexterously carried off the whole Cargoe it was a great Loss to the poor Woman who  lamenting with her Neighbours they advis'd her to go to  Jonathan Wild  and offer a Sum of Money to recover it she went accordingly and when she gave him an Account where she lived and what she had lost he call'd to his Bookkeeper to search the Books to know if any of their People had been lately out to take the Air at  Hackney  The Fellow having examin'd answered immediately that  Wapping Moll  had been there and that  Tawny Bess  was her Maid and  Harry Smart  her Footman  Jonathan  appear'd in a Passion and curs'd them sufficiently but appointed the Gentlewoman to come again in a little Time when he procured the Things upon her paying the Money agreed for  Thus he made them all pay Contribution whether they made Use of him in disposing of the Things or no And when the late Act was made which gives a Pardon to one Felon for convicting another he became absolute over them all for if any of them disoblig'd him or as he call'd it  rebel'd  he took them up and thereby got the Reward appointed by Act of Parliament for taking Highwaymen On the contrary when any of his own People were taken which he had a Mind to save then he endeavour'd to take some other then his own Man by claiming the Benefit of the Act became an Evidence When ever any interloping Traders  started up in the Business that is People who set up for themselves without paying him any Contribution or Homage or holding any Correspondence with him he did all he cou'd to take them and if such were otherwise taken up upon Suspicion or upon any Information and Evidence was wanting to convict them nothing was more common than for him to take up one of his own Fellows whose Life was always in his Power and make him swear himself into some of the Robberies of which the others were suspected whereby their Evidence might obtain some Credit with a Jury and  Jonathan  was intitled to the Reward if he was the Person who took them  And thus by taking some of his own Gang now and then because they had disoblig'd him and apprehending others because they were not of his Gang and hanging them in the manner before described he was reckoned a very useful Man and was often call'd upon by the Court to look at the Prisoners and give them Characters which seem'd to have great Weight at that time And sometimes by ingenious Quirks or by managing the Juries or Evidences he has brought off some of his Favourites who had been taken in the very Facts for which they were committed as he did once by two Fellows who having committed a Robbery on the Highway and several Persons well mounted  and arm'd happening to come by immediately they were pursued and taken with the Gentlemens Watches and Rings about them and being forthwith carried before a Justice of Peace were committed to  Newgate  within a Day or two of the Sessions  Jonathan  whose Wit seldom fail'd him at a Pinch enquiring the Names of the Prosecutors went to them and asking them if they had not been robb'd by such and such Fellows now in  Newgate  The Gentlemen answered they had  Jonathan  pretending a great Spleen to those Fellows who he said were the greatest Rogues in the whole World and that he would have hang'd them long ago if he could have found them and therefore begg'd of the Gentlemen that he might assist them in managing the Prosecution and he wou'd engage the Rascals shou'd not escape The Gentlemen very willing to have Part of the Trouble taken off their Hands accepted his Offer knowing Mr  Wild  to be a Person very well skill'd in those Affairs Accordingly they appointed to meet at a Tavern in the  OldBaily  on the Morning which was appointed for the Trial of these Highwaymen When they met  Jonathan  told them there was a great Croud in the Court and that they had better stay there till the Trial shou'd begin which he said wou'd not be till about Three a Clock in the Afternoon In the mean time a Dinner was bespoke to be ready  at One and  Jonathan  sent a Man to wait in the Court with orders to call them when the Trial came on  Jonathan  made such good Use of his Time that whether by putting something into the Liquor or by fair Drinking is not known but it is certain he made the Gentlemen very drunk who pass'd away the Time till Evening without thinking of the Matter at which Time one of them wondring that their Messenger had not call'd them they sent another to the Court to know what was doing there when they found the Court was broke up and the two Highwaymen were discharg'd there having no Evidence appear'd against them  In an Affair like this  Jonathan  did not come off quite so well tho' the Business was managed with equal Success the Story is this One  Arnold Powell  a notorious Housebreaker was committed to  Newgate  and a Prosecution carrying on against him by one Mr  Eastwick  a Glassgrinder near  Bridewell Jonathan  pays his Respects to the Prosecutor and acquaints him how ready he should be to bring such a Villain to Justice and if he would leave the Matter to his handling he should certainly  send him to sleep with the Fathers  for that was his Expression Accordingly Mr  Eastwick  commits the Management of the Suit to him and chose to be directed by him who he was satisfied  had a better Understanding in those Affairs than himself  Before the Sessions  Jonathan  tho' retain'd on the other Side of the Cause visits Mr  Powell  tells him of the dangerous Circumstances he was in and at the same Time enquires into the Value of his personal Estate the Thief apprehended his meaning and made him sensible that forty Pounds should not part them for it seems this Fellow never came into  Jonathan  's Books whereupon the Bargain was struck the Money paid down and Mr  Wild  left him with this Blessing  Live and prosper    When the Sessions came on a Bill was found for Felony and Burglary against Mr  Powell  for breaking open and robbing the House of the said Mr  Eastwick  so far Mr  Eastwick  saw Matters were carried fair When this was done Mr  Wild  desir'd the Prosecutor and his Witnesses to go to his House in the  OldBayley  that they might nor wait about in the  Sessions houseYard  till the Tryal came on which they readily agreed to from thence  Jonathan  carried them to an Alehouse at the Upperend of the Street quite out of the hearing of the Court and there plies them with Liquors by one of his Agents in the mean Time he gets  Powell  set to the Bar and the Witnesses call'd over and over time after time but no Body appearing nor any Account to be given why they did not the Prisoner was acquitted  When Mr  Eastwick  found how the Game had been play'd he complains to the Recorder of the Abuse who was very ready to do Mr  Wild  all the Justice in the World and therefore commits him to  Newgate  in order to be try'd at the ensuing Sessions for the Offence and  Powell  tho' acquitted then for want of Evidence was detain'd in Custody and convicted the next Sessions perhaps for another Fact and executed but honest  Jonathan  alighted upon his Legs like an expert Tumbler and came off unhurt  However this was by discerning Men look'd upon to be a kind of a Slur upon  Jonathan  's Character he found himself that after this he had not that Credit with the Court upon the Tryal of any Criminal as he us'd to have and he took as odd a way to retrieve it as ever was thought of for in order to insinuate himself into the good Graces of the  Rr  he sets one of his Gang to steal the Velvet Seats out of his Coach and then waited upon him with a Tender of his Service to recover them without any Expence to his Honour but Sir  Wm  despis'd his Offer and generously chose rather to sit down with the Loss than to recover them by giving Countenance to such scandalous Practices  By all the beforementioned Tricks and Artifices  Jonathan  pass'd for a Man of so much Understanding and Interest that the Thieves  began to think he could hang or save whom he pleas'd so that all Malefactors whether of his own Gang or not after they were taken used to flatter themselves that if they cou'd raise any Money for  Jonathan  he wou'd bring them off and even after they were condemned they were of Opinion that his extraordinary Interest might procure them a Reprieve or have the Sentence chang'd to Transportation  It is certain that it was one of his Arts to make them believe so and he used particularly to affect an extraordinary Intimacy with certain Justices of Peace and as it is said he sometimes drank with those Gentlemen at Taverns he used to leave word at Home that if any Body should enquire for him he was gone to such a Tavern to meet Justice suchaone The Use he made of insinuating this Notion into their Heads was that if any Information should be given to these Justices against any of his Friends he should have timely Notice of it from them or their Clerks so that the Party might get out of the way which was a material Thing towards keeping his People always depending upon him  The Reader will imagine by what has been here related that  Jonathan  must be a Person of no uncommon PartsTo govern a Commonwealth already fix'd and establish'd is no more than what may be done  by any common Capacity but to form and establish a Body of such lawless People into what we may call a Form of Government to erect a Commonwealth like that of the Bees in which there shou'd be no Drone in which every Member was oblig'd to go forth and labour and to bring an Offering to him their King of Part of the Product of their Cunning and Industry to be able so many Years to evade the Punishments appointed by the Laws of all Nations for such Persons as make no Difference betwixt  Meum  and  Tuum  and to live not only in a Toleration but even in a kind of Credit amongst the People he was robbing every Day and to escape the Plots and Conspiracies of his own treacherous SubjectsI say to be able to manage all this must proceed from an admirable Wit and Cunning and thorough Observation of the Humours and weak Sides of Men  But to return to our Subject we have taken Notice in what manner  Jonathan  's Revenues were rais'd and encreas'd but as his Subjects were so frequently taken off by untimely Ends his Royalty wou'd by degrees have declin'd and sunk at last to little or nothing if he had not by admirable Foresight and Care provided future Thieves both for himself and the Gallows  The  Mint  in  Southwark  was the Country where  Jonathan  usually went to raise Recruits when his Army began to grow thin  and weak there I say he constantly beat up for Voluntiers and most of his best Men came from thence  He knew it was the Place where Tradesmen who had met with Misfortunes first retir'd to that it was the constant Retreat of all those whom Idleness or Extravagance had render'd obnoxious to the LawHe knew also that People under those Circumstances commonly brought a little Money with them at their first going over which being soon spent by reason of their being out of Business to get more they must of Consequence be reduc'd to extream Necessity till which Time he did not judge them rightly qualified for his Service  As I was let into this Secret of his Proceedings by a Story from his own Mouth I shall relate the Method and Way he went to work with the Gentlemen  Minters    First  He made himself acquainted with all the People who kept publick Houses whether Taverns Alehouses or the Venders of the royal Liquor commonly call'd  Gin  from these he learn'd from Time to Time what People were newly come over and if he lik'd the Description of their Persons and the Account of their Circumstances he took some Opportunity of getting into Company with them and  Jonathan  being facetious as well as frank and open in Conversation made himself very agreeable to  those sort of People who are call'd  merry Fellows  besides  Jonathan  always pretended to compassionate their Misfortunes and to shew his Generosity would treat them and make them drunk and sometimes perhaps lend them small Matters in their extream NecessitiesSo that he has sometimes confess'd that by half a Crown well dispos'd that is lent with a certain Manner of which he was Master he has sometimes got fifty and sometimes a hundred Pounds which it must be confess'd was laying Money out to a very good Advantage  We shall prove this by an Example  Jonathan  came acquainted with  A B  a broken Cheesemonger who had taken Refuge in the  Mint  this poor Fellow being charm'd with the Conversation of the ingenious  Jonathan  spent the little Money he had saved from the Ruin of his Trade in keeping him Company when all was gone  Jonathan  now and then lent him some small Matter and observing him to be young active and a Fellow of Spirit work'd upon him and brought him into his Measures by representing to him the miserable Prospect he had before him telling him he deserv'd to be damn'd if such a clever Fellow as he shou'd want good Cloaths on his Back or Money in his Pocket and that all the World wou'd despise him therefore says he take my Advice and  get Money  The Advice  was good and seasonable for there was nothing in the World the poor Fellow wanted more But how to do it was the Difficultytherefore he beg'd his Friend  Jonathan  to give him some Advice in that important Affair Zds says  Jonathan  I know a great many clever Fellows who keep the best Company in Town and make very smart Figures and if they have not Sixpence in their Pockets now they'll have Money enough before they go to Bed that is if there be any Money to be had betwixt this and  Bath  or this and  Tunbridge    Now the Cheesemonger began to apprehend his Friend  Jonathan  and in his Necessity and Despair said he wou'd do any thing but he had neither Horse nor Arms nor any means of purchasing them but  Jonathan  who did nothing by halves directed him where good Horses were to be hired for the Use of the Gentlemen of the Snaffle and gave him as much Money as wou'd pay for the Hire for he was too cunning to appear in the Matter himself he also directed him to go upon the  Epsom  Road telling him there were no Gentlemen out upon the same Lay that wayand thus our Cheesemonger was turn'd into a Gentleman and equip'd like a Knight Errant in search of Adventures  After he had loiter'd about the Road for some time he saw one Man a Horseback coming towards him without any Servant  or Attendance which proved to be a peaceable Citizen him he ventur'd to stop and commanding him to deliver the Citizen surrender'd all the Money he had without any Words which prov'd to be nine Guineas As soon as our new Highwayman found himself in Possession of the Money he made the best of his way Home to his Kennel the  Mint  without seeking any more Adventures that Day  He was no sooner alighted but he found  Jonathan  who waited to receive him to whom he very frankly gave an Account of what he had done and what he had got with all the Circumstances thinking he had behaved himself very handsomly for a new Beginner nay  Jonathan  himself prais'd him and for his Encouragement took from him but seven Guineas of the nine leaving him two as a mark of his Favour  Perhaps some may be of Opinion that this Dividend was a little unequal and that he who ventur'd all shou'd have had the greatest Share of the Booty but it must be consider'd on the other Side that now he was initiated he was become the Subject nay the Slave of  Jonathan  who had power of Life and Death over him and that so far from murmuring at what he took from him it was  Jonathan  's Opinion he should think himself oblig'd to him that he did not hang him  The Fellow continu'd every now and then to make Excursions sometimes on one Road sometimes on another constantly doing Business by himself and if we may believe  Jonathan  he always left the Fellow some small Matter of what he got whether it happen'd to be little or much but this we must take upon his Credit but however that be the Cheesemonger was so discontented that he resolv'd to desert and see what he cou'd do for himself  Accordingly some time after he disappear'd nor cou'd  Jonathan  find him out by all the Inquiry and Search he cou'd make  Jonathan  rail'd loudly at him saying Thus am I serv'd by a parcel of Rascals when I have put Bread into their Mouths but I'll hang him if there was not another Rogue left in  England  While  Jonathan  was thus enrag'd against the Deserter some People who had been robb'd upon the  Oxford  Road came to make Proposals for the Recovery of some Watches and Pocket Books which had been taken from them  Jonathan  consulted his Books for it must be observ'd he was very exact in minuting down all his Orders and found that no Gentlemen under his Command had been out upon the Road for a Fortnight before wherefore he was very inquisitive to know what sort of Man the Person was who had committed those Robberies and according  to their Description and by other Circumstances he was pretty sure it must be the deserting Cheesemonger  Jonathan  therefore set out towards  Oxford  well mounted and well arm'd intending to renew his Acquaintance with his old Friend who according to several Reports had met with good Luck upon that Road he jog'd on easily visiting all the Villages which lay in the ByRoads both on the Right and Left going into every Inn looking into the Stables to see the Horses and drinking with all the Ostlers and Chamberlains and enquiring of them what Company was in each House and what Company they lately had which was his constant Method when he went in search of a Deserter  He spent a good deal of Time in this manner to no purpose when moving on towards  Oxford  he met a Coach which had been just robb'd the Coachman giving him warning to take care and telling him the Place where they had been attack'd was not above a quarter of a Mile off Upon this  Jonathan  enquires the Number of the People who had robb'd them the Coachman told him it was done by a single Man and in describing him confirm'd  Jonathan  it must be his Cheesemonger Upon this Assurance  Jonathan  sets Spurs to his Horse and coming to the Spot which had just before been the Scene of Action he hastes and takes a  View of the Ground like an experienced General and considering with himself what a Man of any Discipline wou'd do after such an Incident in order to puzzle and beguile his Pursuers in case any Hue and Cry shou'd be rais'd to pursue him he spied a Lane upon the right Hand and wisely concluded with himself that if the Cheesemonger was a Man of Conduct he must have struck down that Lane after he had finish'd his Adventure therefore he doubled his Pace and after a short Gallop came in sight of a Man in a great Coat well mounted he judg'd now that he was come to the end of his Enquiry and therefore slacken'd his Pace that he might prepare himself for Battle for  Jonathan  's Courage was equal to his Conduct The Man before hearing the Tread of a Horse look'd back but seeing no more than one Man he thought it had not the Appearance of a Pursuit and therefore he never mov'd a Step the faster and it was at such a Distance that he did not know the sweet Fiz of  Jonathan Jonathan  who was stuck round with Pistols as thick as an Orange with Cloves or like the Man in an old Almanack with Darts was not idle all this while but took care to be well cock'd and prim'd which Part he manag'd under his Great Coat for he took care to conceal his warlike Appointment lest it might put the Enemy into a Posture of Defence  As he approach'd nearer the Man cast another Look back and immediately knew it was  Jonathan  Upon which he faced about manfully and drawing his Pistol bid  Jonathan  stand off for he had done with him  Jonathan  put on the Fox's Skin and employing all his Oratory for he had an excellent Talent at wheedling begg'd that they might be good Friends and go and drink together swearing that he loved Men of Courage and that he desired nothing but that they might be good Friends as beforeBut the valiant Cheesemonger told him his Mind in few Words  Jonathan  says he you have led me here into a damn'd Trade which I am weary of and now I've got Money in my Pocket I am resolv'd to go over to  Holland  and try to put my self into some honest Business by which I may get my Living without Fear or Danger  Jonathan  having a Pistol in his Hand under his Great Coat which the other could not see still continued his Wheedling and approaching nearer and nearer that he might have a sure Mark he of a sudden drew forth his desperate Hand and let fly a Brace of Bullets in the Face of the valiant Cheesemonger and drawing forth a sharp Hanger at the same Instant flew upon him like a Tyger and with one Blow fell'd him to his Horse's Feet all weltring in his GoreSo have I seen and with as little Mercy a gallant Ox fell'd to the Ground by some fierce  Butcher and so like  Jonathan  have I seen him bestride the mighty Beast and strip him of his Skin  Jonathan  thus having obtain'd a compleat Victory and being Master of the Field immediately fell to plunderingHe found fifty odd Guineas in the Fellow's Pockets with some Moveables of Value of which having taken  Livery  and  Seisin  according to the Law of Arms he went to the next Town leading the Horse of the slain in a kind of Triumph as a Mark of his Victory and enquiring for the next Justice of Peace he surrender'd himself telling him that he had kill'd a Highwayman and giving a Direction where he had left the Body the Justice sent and had it taken up when he was known by some Stage Coachmen and others to be the same that had infested that Road for some time past  Jonathan  at the same time signifying to the Justice that he was the famous  Wild the Thiefcatcher  the Justice took Bail for him and  Jonathan  return'd Home to his Wife loaded with Victory and Plunder  I presume this Story may suffice to let the Reader know by what kind of Policy this  Machiavel  of Thieves supply'd his Commonwealth with Subjects as fast as they were cut offThose whom he observ'd to be active brisk and couragious he put into his Cavalry there was another Corps which we may call his Dragoons because they serv'd sometimes  on Horseback sometimes on Foot as was most consistent with the Service these sometimes went forth doubly arm'd and on the wide extended Common attack'd the Stage Coach in open Day other whiles they laid Ambuscades and lying  perdue  in some Ditch surpriz'd the heedless Traveller on Foot and were counted his best Men being as the Saying is  in utrumque parati  or having two Strings to their Bow  But as  Jonathan  was a deep Studier of Nature he knew that Mens Talents were different and that he who had not Courage enough to bid a Man stand upon the Road might nevertheless make an excellent Pickpocket and he took care that no Man's Parts should be misapply'd Nay it is said that nothing pleas'd him more than to see a Child or Youth of a promising Genius and that such never wanted his Encouragement insomuch that a little Boy in a Crowd having at a certain time stole a Pair of silver Buckles out of a Man's Shoes without being felt his Mother not a little proud of her Child's Ingenuity presented him to  Jonathan  who gave him half a Crown with this prophetick Saying  My Life on't he'll prove a great Man  But I must observe that  Jonathan  's Prophecy never was fulfill'd the Youth dying before he came to the Age of Manhood for he was hang'd before he arriv'd at sixteen  He had another Sort of Gentlemen under his Command whom in the Cant or Language of the Profession he distinguish'd by the Name of  Spruce Prigs  these were Persons not qualified for the bold and manly Employment of Knockingdown Housebreaking  c  but being Persons of Address and Behaviour were dispatch'd to Court on BirthNights to Balls Operas Plays and Assemblies for which Purpose they were furnish'd with laced Coats brocade Wastcoats fine Perriwigs and sometimes equipp'd with handsom Equipages such as Chariots with Footmen in Liveries and also  Valet de Chambres  the Servants being all Thieves like the Master  This Body of Gentlemen were generally chosen out of such as had been Footmen who by waiting at Tables and frequenting publick Places with their Masters and Mistresses knew something of the Address and Discourse used among Gentlemen and the better to qualify them to acquit themselves handsomly at Balls  Jonathan  sometimes paid a Dancingmaster to teach them to dance that is after he lost his own Dancingmaster the celebrated Mr  Lun  who died in his own Profession  viz  dancing being hang'd at  Kingston  for a Robbery on the Highway who he sometimes said was a great Loss to the Corporation  There were another Class of the same Sort of Gentlemen but who did not strike such  bold Strokes as the other or as we may say did not fly at such high Game these appear'd commonly like young Mercers or Drapers being always dress'd very clean in plain Cloth good Wigs and good Linen with a Ring or Rings on their Fingers the Places which they haunted most were  SadlersWells  and all the Hops about the Town They were also great Practicers of the Art of Dancing and some of them were famous for Hornpipes  Their Business was to promote CountryDancing and while the young Fellows and their Girls were very earnest at their Diversion they were to assist a Confederate for nothing cou'd be done without a Partner to carry off the silver Swords and Canes if there were any whilst the Dancer himself was to stand his Ground always pretending to have lost a Cane or Hat amongst the rest and making the greatest Clamor of all  The genteelest of these Sort of Gentlemen sometimes took handsom Lodgings of two or three Guineas a Week and being attended by their sham Servants these Servants were to give out that their Master was just return'd from his Travels that he was a Peer or at least a Baronet of a great Estate And the better to carry on the Bite they took care to assume the Name of some Person of great Estate who was actually Abroadthat his Father or some Relation being lately  dead was the Occasion of his coming over in Haste to take Possession of a great Estate and that His Lordship or Honour wou'd not appear nor have it known he was arriv'd till he had put himself and all his Servants in Mourning wherefore a Draper was sent for and a vast Quantity of fine Cloth was agreed for not only for his own Family but he was to give Mourning to all his RelationsThe Draper was generally recommended by the Landlord who thought himself very happy in having such a Customer as His LordshipAs soon as the Cloth came in it was immediately sent off being carried away by some Accomplices who waited in the Way and represented Porters before the Draper cou'd come for his MoneyBut if as it sometimes happen'd the Draper came himself at the same time with the Cloth why then His Lordship was so busy in his Closet that he could not speak to him but he sent him out a Banker's Note desiring him to give the rest but if the Draper had not Money enough about him then he was to go and receive the Whole and bring His Lordship the rest but as soon as his Back was turn'd the whole  Posse  mov'd off leaving generally an empty Trunk or two to pay for the Lodging  This Trick has often been play'd in the Streets betwixt the  Temple  and  Somersethouse  the Situation of those Places being very commodious for making a Retreat by Water  Jonathan  one Night at  SouthwarkFair  was observ'd to sit in one of the Booths in a Corner of the Pit as much out of sight as he cou'd and being ask'd by an Acquaintance what he was doing thereSee that Beau says he in the SideBox pointing to a handsom young Fellow who was very fine that is one of my People but the Son of a Whore has hid himself from me these two Months but I'll frighten him out of his Wits and if you have a mind for a little Sport go to the next Tavern and I'll divert youWe had not been there two Minutes for I was one of the Company when  Jonathan  enters with Sir  Fopling Jonathan  immediately with many Oaths and Menaces began to question him where he had been and what the Dl was the Reason he had not come near him in all that Time The Beau in a very great Fright swore and curs'd and pray'd all in a Breath begging  Jonathan  to forgive him telling him he cou'd not help it having been in Jail in  Lincolnshire  where he went upon a very  good Lay  that was his Term for he went down there expecting to marry a Lady of great Fortune but that miscarrying that he might not lose his Labour he  spoke with  a silver Tankard and some Spoons for which he was committed however he managed it so well by the Assistance of  nimble Dick  who personated his Servant that nothing was found upon him and so the  Pimps  discharg'd  him not out of good Will dn them says he but for Want of Proofs But that he was upon a Lay at that time if he wou'd let him go that he was sure of getting a Gold Watch that Night and swore upon his  Honour  he wou'd bring  Jonathan  some Money the next Day  Upon these Protestations and Promises and his paying for a Bottle of Wine  Jonathan  let him goWhen he was gone  Jonathan  told us he was an ingenious pretty Fellow and wou'd live like a Gentleman in any part of the World for that the last Birthnight he went to Court as fine as any thing there and no body knowing him he was taken for some young Man of Fortune just come to his Estate his Design being to pick the King's Pocket but that he was hinder'd and interrupted by a certain Lady a Citizen's Wife who wou'd not let him get near enough for the Fondness she had of shewing herself to his My however it cost her dear for she lost her repeating Watch by the BargainHe told us that he had sav'd the young Fellow's Life once by good Management at his Tryal for he thought it was pity such a clever Fellow shou'd be cut off so soon and that he had done a great many handsom Things since that Time We desir'd to know of  Jonathan  what the young Fellow was originally he told us he was the Son of a Chairman who living with a Lady of  Quality she put this young Fellow when a Boy into a Livery that this Lady loving her Pleasures and being a Woman of Intrigue the Boy got the Reputation of being a very good Pimp so that if his Lady had not died he wou'd have been made a Page and then perhaps Groom of the Chamber and then recommended to my Lord for some considerable Post so that by this Time he might have been a topping Grandee if the Death of the Lady had not put an end to his Hopes of rising that way for after her Decease being out of Place he had no Thought or Ambition of going into any way of getting his Bread but by being a Servant so that being nimble and light of Body he practis'd running thinking to get a running Footman's Place with some Person of Quality when I says  Jonathan  happen'd to meet with him and thinking it a pity that such Parts shou'd be buried and lost to the World I took him into my Protection and I warrant you'll see him  preferr'd one Time or other    But tho' it is some Years since this Thing happen'd I was not long since inform'd by  Jonathan  that the Beau is still alive that he made a considerable Figure at the last Installment at  Windsor  being the Person who took the Lady  Mn  's Diamond Buckle that when her Ladyship applied to  Jonathan  for the Recovery of it he ask'd her how much she wou'd give she answer'd twenty  Guineas Znds Madam says he you offer nothing it cost the Gentleman who took it forty for his Coach Equipage and other Expences to  Windsor    Jonathan  gave us to understand that these Gentleman often visited the  Bath Tunbridge  and  Epsom  not staying long in a Place but going from one to the other and always thrusting themselves into the best Company their Business there was to get Watches and Snuff Boxes and whenever there happen'd a Crowd on the Walks or in the long Rooms then it is these Gentlemen  work  and if the Things shou'd happen to be miss'd while they are in the Room the Figure they make carries them off without being suspected but as has been before observ'd for fear of Accidents there must be a Footman not only for State but for Use who to prevent the Consequences of a search receives the Booty from the Master as soon as the Work is done and conveys it to some Place of Safety  The Footman in his Way is a Person of as great Service to the Commonwealth of Thieves as the Master he is to insinuate himself into the Acquaintance of all the Servants wherever he goes from them he is to learn all the Circumstances and Affairs of their respective Masters and Mistressesas what Plate they bring with them to those Places of Pleasure when they remove to Town or  to any other Place and how they go attended which are very material Advices for Intelligence is sent of all these Things to  Jonathan  who takes care to have them spoke with upon the Road if it be feasible and safe the Footman is also to endeavour to corrupt some of the Servants he converses with and if they are Fellows who love Mirth and good Company they are often delighted with these Fellows who study to please and they are by all means to come acquainted with the Servant Maids who live in good Families and to make Love to some one of them by these Means they not only become acquainted with the Situation of the House and know where all the Plate and other rich Moveables are kept but if one of the Damsels shou'd happen to be captivated with the Person of Mr  John  or Mr  Thomas  or whatever Name he takes she may be wrought upon to let him in at Night and so a good Prize may be got with little Hazard and Danger  Jonathan  told us the World was grown so  peery  that was his Term for sharp that ingenious Men meaning Thieves must have Recourse to Stratagems or else they cou'd not get Bread for says he there are not so many Opportunities of working as heretofore there are such a damn'd Number of poor People more than formerly that are not worth robbing and those that have made  them poor and got their Money take so much care to keep it and are so well guarded that it is very difficult to come at them downright robbing or your chance Jobs are not worth a Farthing and I may say without Vanity that if it had not been for the Confederacy I have form'd the  Business wou'd have come to nothing  but let them be as cautious and as cunning as they will we'll be more cunning than theyI'll tell you a Stratagem of some of the Gentlemen I have the Honour to commandThere were a parcel of rich Citizens who took a singular Pleasure in ringing Bells one Day in the Week they met and din'd together and pass'd the rest of the Day in ringing in Summer Time they travel'd from Place to Place wherever they heard of a good Ring of Bells in order to divert themselves with ringing and to try where were the sweetest BellsOne of our Gentry found Means of getting into their Company and one Night when they were pretty warm with Wine and boasting of their great Excellence in ringing our Spark offer'd that he and five more he wou'd bring shou'd ring with them for two hundred Guineas provided he was to name the Bells they took him up immediately and enter'd into Articles under the Forfeiture of an hundred Pounds to those that shou'd fail who named Lincoln Cathedral  where they agreed to meet by a certain Day  Our Citizens set out some in their own Coaches and some on Horseback with two hundred Guineas for their Wager and each of them Money besides for Expences and our Spark with his Confederates met them very punctuallyThe Citizens immediately strip'd themselves in order to put on their ringing Dresses consisting of Drawers Wastcoats and Caps and while they were beginning to try the Bells one of our People convey'd away their Cloaths when the rest saw him safe out they stole off and mounted their Horses which were ready and left the Citizens to enjoy all their Musick themselvesThis Expedition was worth near three hundred Pounds in Money for all they carried was in their Breeches Pockets I say three hundred Pounds besides Watches Snuff Boxes Tobacco Boxes Cloaths and Perriwigs  We own'd to  Jonathan  that this Affair was well projected and as well executed Oh says he this is nothing to what has been done for one of our People once stole a House of six Rooms on a Floor and an hundred and fifty Pounds a Year Rent  As this appear'd to be a kind of Rhodomontade we desir'd Mr  Wild  to let us know how that cou'd be done and he being very communicative in his Temper told us the  Story A Gentleman had fitted up a House in  Queen'sSquare  in a very handsom Manner expecting to let it to some foreign Minister or  English  Person of Quality which as soon as 'twas ready I equipt a Fellow who had prov'd himself a Man fit for Business in a plain neat Suit goldheaded Cane Snuff Box  c  a good Chariot with two other Rogues for Footmen This suppos'd Gentleman calls upon the Landlord and offers to treat with him for the Hire of his House which he said if he lik'd his Terms he would take a Lease of for twenty one Years whereupon the Bargain was struck and in few Days the Leases were drawn the Rent to be paid at half yearly Payments and the Furniture was promis'd by the Squire to be brought in the  Wednesday  following  The Week after the Landlord calls at the House to see his new Tenant in order to promote a more intimate Acquaintance but finds no Body there but a shabby old Man and not one piece of Furniture but on the contrary two or three of the Marble Chimney Pieces and Slabs taken down He enquires of the old Man the meaning of it who told him his Master order'd it for he did not like the Fashion of 'em and was pleas'd to have them alter'd The Landlord swore and storm'd like a Madman bid him get out of the House and vow'd neither he nor his Master should have any thing to do  there but at length was pacify'd upon his assuring him his Master design'd nothing but what was honourable and would make him all the Satisfaction he could desire and that the next Day at Noon he would come himself and direct what he would have done Whereupon he went away but not very well pleas'd you may be sure and returning the next Day as the Fellow had appointed he meets some Men at the Door carrying out two ChimneyGlasses and several Pictures that had been fix'd to the Pannels over the ChimneyPieces which he stop'd but the Squire happening himself to be in the House but without his Chariot or Footmen required to know by what Authority he stopt the Goods from going where he sent them  Why Sir  says the Landlord  are they not my own What wou'd you pull my House down before my Face and send it G knows where why is not your own Furniture brought home as you appointed Sir  says the Tenant  I have had two Children sick of the SmallPox which hinder'd me from moving so soon as I expected but tomorrow some of my Goods will be here But what are you doing replies  the Landlord  with these that you send away Why  says he  I am for fitting up Things according to my own Fancy and I don't matter the Expence of it for as I alter the ChimneyPieces to another Form the Glasses must be made to answer them and  the Frames of the Pictures I shall have made wider to square with the Glasses When I fitted up this House  says the Landlord  I thought it might have serv'd any Man of Quality in the Kingdom That might be  said the Squire again  I'll have Things done agreeable to my own Humour for all that When your Rent's due I'll pay it and when my Lease is expired I shall leave the House in as good Condition as I have found it    The Landlord finding it in vain to oppose him and withal that he had promised that some of his Goods would certainly be brought to the House the next Day which he hoped would be some Security for what he might possibly suffer by the Alterations the Tenant was making he waited till then and came again to the House but was still more provoked to see that all the Furniture that was brought consisted of two old Chairs and a Table not worth half a Crown and they had in the mean time been so expert in making the Alterations as they call'd it that they had took down a very fine new Staircase and the Wainscot of the best Room Whereupon the Landlord finding himself really trick'd arrests the Tenant in an Action of  l  But I got my Gentleman bail'd and order'd my Attorney to summon the Plaintiff before a Judge to shew Cause of Action which he failing to do was oblig'd to take common Bail But this not answering  his Purpose for in reality the Defendant ow'd him nothing the Landlord files a Bill in the  Exchequer  upon which the Tenant prefers a cross Bill obliging him to answer to several Points particularly the Letting the House to him which as he could not deny the Landlord's Bill was dismiss'd with Costs of Suit and the Suit at Common Law went against him also by Default And the Tenant going to work again upon the Premisses the Landlord thought fit to make Overtures of Agreement  viz  That upon a Surrender of his Lease and giving up the Possession of the House in the Condition it was then in he would pay all his Charges and release him from all Damages whatsoever Which since there was no more to be got by my Consent the Terms were accepted of and so the Landlord besides a Year and a half's Rent sat down at  l  Loss Which I suppose will make him take a little more Care how he lets his Houses  At one time the stealing Shopkeepers AccountBooks was grown a considerable Branch of Trade of which  Jonathan  gave us one Instance which is worth relating  A Merchant a considerable Dealer in Hops in  Thamesstreet  had his Books stole and applying to me offer'd ten Guineas to have them restor'd The  Prigs  says he were in my  Ken  that  nim'd  'em out of his  Swag  To explain this Language it means that the  Thieves were then in his House that stole them out of the Shop But to go on with the Story in plain Terms  Jonathan  went into the Room where they were and made the Report but they sitting in Council with two or three others of the same Squadron tho' not in that Detachment declared that they thought the Books were really worth twenty that is to return to the Owners which  Jonathan  notify'd to the Merchant But in short the Agreement was fifteen But then arose a Dispute about the Delivery  Jonathan  propos'd that he should leave the Money behind him and the Books be brought to his House which he scrupling  Jonathan  said to him  Sir do you question my Honour I scorn to do an ill thing by any Man No Sir  answer'd he  by no means  and then readily laid down the Money and went his Way And before he got home himself the Books were at his House Which serves to shew how far  Jonathan  's Honour was to be depended on  Within three Weeks the same Gentleman came to  Jonathan  's House upon the very same Business for his ShopBooks were gone again and he would fain have had five Guineas bated this time because of his having been a Customer before but  Jonathan  said 'twas nothing to him  If the Gentleman  says he  will take five Shillings I shall agree to it  So in short he paid down his Money  like a fair Dealer and was going home as before but  Jonathan  call'd him back and ask'd him how and in what part of his Shop his Countinghouse was built He told him 'twas next the Street and the Door open'd withinside behind the Counter Why says  Jonathan  you are quite wrong you'll never keep your Books if that's the Case But I'll come to Morrow my self and see it and then I'll advise you what's proper to be done  The next Day  Jonathan  comes to  Thamesstreet  the Books having been sent before and meets with the Merchant at home He takes a Survey of the whole Affair and advises the old Countinghouse to be pull'd down and a new one to be erected at the farther End of the Shop and to break out a Skylight over head this he said would be the only Contrivance to make all safe Which was done according to  Jonathan  's Model and yet hardly a Month happen'd before it was again attack'd with the like Success and cost him the same Sum over again to get it out of  Jonathan  's Purgatory The Manner of the Adventure is as follows A Gentleman well dress'd watch'd his Opportunity and came into the Shop and ask'd if Mr was at home Whereupon he was told that he himself was the Person Sir says he I have two or three Words to speak with you in private and so walks him towards his Countinghouse The Hopmerchant  goes in first expecting the Gentleman wou'd have follow'd in order to declare his Business to him there but instead of that he only reaches out his Hand to the Desk upon which the abovementioned Books lay and takes them away and at the same instant shuts to the Door locks it upon the HopDealer and walks off very leisurely  Jonathan  about this time had one of his best Hands deserted him and yet the Fellow still did Business as Mr  Wild  found by his Books and the Accounts that came in  Jonathan  's Clerk minuted down a Gold Watch a pair of Diamond EarRings with several other Things of less value which were  made  that is stole in their Language by this Fellow and yet he had miss'd several Musters and  Jonathan  nor any of his People had heard one syllable of him for above three Months any otherwise than that such and such Things were  spoke with  which he knew must be by the Devil or this Rascal he said therefore 'twas time to take him off Whereupon  Jonathan  was continually upon the hunt for him but as he kept Company with no other of the Profession it was a difficult Matter for his Master to get Intelligence of him without his grand Master's Assistance but whether the Devil did really put it into his Servant  Jonathan  's Head or what other way he found it out I can't say but true it is that at length he got certain Information where he then lodg'd  Mr  Wild  had my Lord Chief Justice's Warrant in his Pocket so taking two or three Constables with him about four in the Morning he beset the House which was in  Bishopsgatestreet  the Corner of  street  a PublickHouse  Jonathan  headed the Posse with a Pistol in each Hand and up Stairs he goes to his Room tho' not so silently but that he heard them upon the Stairs and therefore he gets up and puts on his Breeches Shoes and Stockings by that time  Jonathan  had wrench'd open the Door for it was lock'd within side upon sight of whom he gave a spring out of the Window which was one Story high and came down into a little Yard from thence leap'd over a Wall into the Street and ran cross the Way into a LinenDraper's House whose Door happen'd to stand open At that time the Servants of the House were washing below Stairs to whom the Fellow begs for Protection for that he was pursu'd by Bailiffs and if he should be taken he must be inevitably ruin'd and undone The poor credulous Women pity'd the Man's Case and told him he should stay with them till the Bloodsucking Villains were gone To return to  Jonathan  and the Constables as soon as they saw their Man fly out of the Window you may be sure they were not long behind him but as much Haste as they made down Stairs they saw not the least Shadow of him neither in the Yard or  in the Street which prodigiously surpriz'd them all But  Jonathan  peer'd about being satisfy'd his Motion from the Window was downwards therefore he must have taken House somewhere and at last spy'd this LinenDraper's Door open he goes over acquaints the Gentleman with what had happen'd and assures him the Rogue could be no where but in his House He said he had seen no such Person and that he had not been from the Shop above a Minute  Sir  says  Jonathan that was the very time he slipt in give me leave to search for him  Which being granted he went into the Washhouse where for a good while they deny'd they saw any such Person till being informed he was no Debtor but a Highwayman and Housebreaker they own'd the Matter and told Mr  Wild  the Man he look'd for was in the Coalhole under the Stairs whereupon he takes a Candle calls all his Myrmidons about him and into the Coalhole he goes but no Highwayman was there then he searches round the Cellar Kitchen and in short every Place where he thought a Man could be conceal'd but no Body was to be seen  Jonathan  own'd he never was so foil'd in all the Course of his Practice before he came up and told the Master of the House there was no Body there the Washerwomen were frightned out of their Wits believing they had seen a Spirit and all look'd very foolish  upon one another till the LinenDraper gave them to know that if any Man went down Stairs he must be there still for he was sure no Body had come up from thence he having staid in Sight ever since and then persuaded  Jonathan  to go down again and look into all the WashingTubs and search every Place over again for there is says he no other Way to get out but up these Stairs and so into the Street  Mr  Wild  was prevail'd upon at last and he and the Constables with his  Guard de Corps  redescended and finding one of the Tubs standing Bottom upwards they turn'd that up as the Gentleman had put it into their Heads and there they found poor  Culprit Jonathan  had no Patience but flew upon him like a Tyger  You treacherous Dog  said he where are the Diamond EarRings and GoldWatch you stole at such a Place G dn me you Villain you cheating Son of a Whore I'll hang you if there's never another Rogue in  England  you vile Rascal  We must remark here that tho'  Jonathan  in the main us'd to talk up the Gentlemen of his Game to be generally bright clever Fellows yet when he was angry with some of them he would own  there were Scoundrels of the Profession    Notwithstanding this Bounce of  Jonathan  's the Prisoner understood how to soften this  Machiavel  s Temper and thereupon whisper'd  him to go up to his Lodging and look behind the Head of the Bed which  Jonathan  did telling the People of the House he must go up Stairs for the Fellow's Cloaths which he brought down along with him and in a Hole where the Thief directed him to he found a gold Watch two silver ones Rings and other Things of Value which he put into his own Pocket for any Body else would not have known what to have done with them and the Prisoner being carried before the Justice was committed on Suspicion of Felony and the next Sessions no Body appearing against him he was discharged  The Success that  Jonathan  went on with in his Business render'd him famous all over  London  and he made use of several little Arts to make himself appear considerable to distant Parts of the Kingdom particularly by some Printers of NewsPapers and DyingSpeeches whom he prevail'd on to give him a Character therein in which he was generally stiled THIEFCATCHERGENERAL OF GREATBRITAIN His House was handsomly furnish'd and set out with Plate Pictures  c  and when his Wife appear'd abroad it was generally with a Footman in a fine lac'd Livery He kept a CountryHouse dress'd well and in Company affected an Air of Grandeur A little before his Catastrophe he promis'd me a Haunch or a Side of Venison whenever I pleased to send to him saying he had two  Parks at his Command well stock'd with Deer  The Wealth that he was suppos'd to have amass'd by this Business made several Persons look upon him with Envy and some well enough acquainted in the Roguish Arts attempted to set up against him a few Years ago the Principal were one  Feltn  a superannuated Thief  Riddlesdn  an Attorney and Thief whose chief Merit for the Support of his Pretensions to this Practice was his having sacrilegiously and feloniously broke open the RoyalChapel at  Whitehall  and stole thence the CommunionPlate and Mr  Hn  City Marl This last and  Jonathan  wrote Pamphlets against each other as it was the Custom then between great Men but  Jonathan  laying himself too open  Hn  dropt the Pen and took up the Cudgels of the Law with which he bang'd  Jonathan  so that he thought fit to buy his Peace at the Price of a Sum of Money  However none of them all was able to give  Jonathan  any notable Disturbance in his Office on the contrary he found Means soon after to get  Riddlen  transported for not complying with the Conditions of his Pardon to make  Feltn  run mad and  Hn  entirely to quit his Pretensions  Wherefore he turn'd himself again to his BusinessAnd as we were enumerating how  many Species of Thieves he had under his Command we shall resume that Part of our Story  There were another Sort of Gentry under his Command whose Business it was to loiter about the Streets in the Daytime and as Servants who go of short Errands to a Chandler's Shop or Baker's are apt to leave the Door a jar as they call it they were to whip in and seize upon the next Thing that was portable and bring it off They generally peep'd in to see that no Body was in the ForeParlours and if by Chance any Body should surprize them they were ready to enquire if some Person with a strange Name did not live there tho' it seldom falls out so because they generally do their Business in a Minute  These Sort of People sometimes go in Liveries and sometimes dress'd like Ticket Porters with Silver Badges either upon their Coats or about their Necks one of them some Time since whipp'd into a House in  KingStreet  near  LongAcre  which is divided into Tenements the People furnishing their own Lodgings and going directly up two pair of Stairs from whence he saw a Woman who inhabited it come down he easily put back the Lock and finding nothing in the Room of any Value except the Bedding he tied it all up and was carrying it off when the Owner happen'd to meet him at  the lower End of the Stairs and asking him where he was carrying that Bedding He answer'd without Hesitation that he brought it from Mr the Upholsterer and was carrying it to such a one but I find they don't live here Oh says the Woman they live at next Door thank you Mistress says the Fellow and before she got up Stairs to find it was her own Bedding he had got into a Hackney Coach and carried it safe off  These People sometimes went disguis'd like Chairmen in great Coats and Harness and a couple of them meeting together stole the young Dutchess of  Marlborough  's Chair as her Grace was visiting at Mrs  Hn  's in  Piccadilly  her Chairmen and Footmen being gone to a neighbouring AleHouse one of her Servants thought immediately of applying to Mr  Wild  who told him that if he wou'd leave ten Guineas he might have the Chair the next Day the Man made some Difficulty of leaving the Money beforehand but Mr  Wild  told him he was a Man of Honour and scorn'd to wrong him and indeed his Character was by this Time establish'd as a Man that dealt honourably in his Way so that the Man ventur'd at last to leave the Money wherefore Mr  Wild  bid him direct the Dutchess's Chairmen to attend the Morning Prayers at  Lincoln  's  InnChapel  and there they shou'd find the Chair which the Fellows did accordingly and they  found the Chair with the Crimson Velvet Cushions and Damask Curtains all safe and unhurt  And it must be observ'd that whenever  Jonathan  oblig'd the Parties to leave the Money beforehand he very punctually comply'd with the Terms of Agreement as to the Delivery of the Goods for one of his common Sayings was  that Honesty was the best Policy    He frequently drew out Detachments of some of his cleverest Fellows whom he sent out upon Command to Country Fairs upon which Occasion he generally march'd out himself for indeed the Service could not be well carried on without him for the common People seeing  Jonathan  there were the more careless because he always gave out that he came to take some Rogues whom he suspected to be there and the People had a Notion that his Presence frightned away the Thieves and to countenance this Belief he went doubly and trebly arm'd and often wore Armour under his Cloaths which he took care to shew in all Companies being attended by three or four and sometimes half a Dozen terrible looking Fellows by way of  Garde du Corps  as if all Thieves in  England  had vow'd to sacrifice him  This Grimace took very well for it gave him an Opportunity of protecting and carrying off the Booty which was made in these  Fairs and if any of his Party was in Danger of being taken these Myrmidons of his who pass'd for his Body Guard were to run into the Crowd and under pretence of assisting the People who were about to seize such Rogues were to try to shuffle off and favour their Escape  In fine his Business in all Things was to put a false Gloss upon Things and to make  Fools  of Mankind which was his own Expression yet when he had a Mind to be merry to drink his Bottle and to laugh at the World he talk'd with too much Freedom of himself and his own Management and not without some Vanity of which there are a thousand Instances We shall give one because it is shortA certain Tradesman a very honest Man tho' of  Jonathan  's Acquaintance going into a Tavern where he expected to meet some Company by Mistake went in where  Jonathan  was drinking with some merry Fellows the Tradesman was about to draw back but  Jonathan  press'd him to sit down and take a Glass with them the Tradesman was a little angry with  Jonathan  for the following Reason about a Week before passing thro' a Country Fair he saw  Jonathan  a Horseback and asking him how he did  Jonathan  damn'd him and bid him not trouble him with impertinent Questions therefore the Tradesman desir'd to know the Reason why  Jonathan  snapp'd him up in that  rude angry Manner when he had spoke to him so civilly Zds says  Jonathan  you disturb'd me in my Business for  I had at that Time twenty Pair of Hands at Work    And indeed he employ'd Hands in all sorts of Works so that according to the Author of the  Fable of the Bees  he was a great Benefactor to Trade for as some of our News Papers have observ'd he kept in Pay many Artists for the altering of Watches and Rings so he also kept a kind of Magazine or Armory of all kind of Instruments us'd in  Thievery  as Picklocks Files Saws and Engines for forcing Doors Windows  c  which he made no Secret of shewing pretending he found them upon such and such Housebreakers whom he had taken and convicted tho' it is certain he did not suffer them to grow rusty for want of Use for he never went into a House but like an Engineer he wou'd view on which side it might be attack'd with the most Advantage and he knew better Things than to send his Men upon Actions without Arms  Sometimes  Jonathan  spoke in the Stile of a Prince as when the Son of Mrs  Knap  who was murther'd by a Footpad near  Gray'sInnWall  went to him to desire his Assistance in taking the Murderer and putting ten Guineas in his Hand for his Encourgement with a Promise of forty more when the Work shou'd be done  Jonathan  answer'd  him gravely he might depend he wou'd produce the Villian  for  says he  I never pardon Murther  and indeed he was as good as his Word for he seized the Fellow at the  Jeruasalem Tavern  in  Clerkenwell  and he was hang'd the Sessions following  Whilst he went on with this Tide of Success and seem'd to carry the World before him an ill Wind arose which blew from a certain Corner of the Law and which seem'd to threaten the Overthrow of his CommonwealthFor Sir  Wm Tson  observing what Mischiefs arose from the Practice of receiving stolen Goods and returning them again to the Proprietors for such Sums of Money as the Receiver and Proprietor agreed upon which Money no doubt must be divided betwixt the Receiver and Thief thought of putting an end to it by bringing a Bill into the House of Commons for the  more effectual transporting of Felons and for preventing Burglaries and Felons  in which among other Things was the following Clause  "And whereas there are several Persons who have secret Acquaintance with Felons and who make it their Business to help Persons to their stolen Goods and by that means gain Money from them which is divided between them and the Felons whereby they greatly encourage such Offenders Be it Enacted by the Authority  aforesaid That whereever any Person taketh Money or Reward directly or indirectly under Pretence or upon Account of helping any Person or Persons to any stolen Goods or Chattles every such Person so taking Money or Reward as aforesaid unless such Person do apprehend or cause to be apprehended such Felon who stole the same and cause such Felon to be brought to his Trial for the same and give Evidence against him shall be guilty of Felony and suffer the Pains and Penalties of Felony according to the Nature of the Felony committed in stealing such Goods and in such and the same Manner as if such Offender had himself stole such Goods and Chattels in the Manner and with such Circumstances as the same were stolen"  We are well inform'd that after this Act had pass'd the Rr was pleas'd to send for  Wild  to admonish him and let him know the Danger and Hazard of pursuing the same Course of Life any longer and recommended to him to detect Rogues and bring them to Justice promising upon that Condition to give him all Encouragement reminding him of what considerable Sums he had got that Way already by which he might judge that he might get sufficient to keep him by doing good Service to the Publick and living honestly  Whether these good Admonitions or the Fear of this new Law wrought upon his Conscience is uncertain but there was a sudden Damp put upon all his Business his  Books were shut up  for some Weeks and he grew so abstemious that he refused several Sums offer'd him for the Recovery of things stolenYet he did not break off all Acquaintance and Correspondence with his old Friends and Allies the Thieves on the contrary having the Command of some Money he gave them some small Matters just what he pleas'd for what  Old Nick  had sent them in their Way and deposited the Goods up in a Wareheouse  In the mean time all  Wild  's Acquaintance were inquisitive to know what he intended to turn himself to for they took it for granted that this new Act had quite cut him out of his former Business having a Notion that he was too cunning ever to venture himself within the Clutches of the LawWherefore he talk'd of a new Project which was for setting up a Policy and opening an Office for taking in Subscriptions for insuring against Robbery pretending to settle a sufficient Fund and give good Security for the Performance of Articles sometimes shewing a manuscript Paper of Proposals and consulting People whom he supposed to have any Understanding in those Affairs extolling the great Use and  Advantage this Project wou'd be to the Publick not doubting he said but that all Trading People as well as Gentlemen and Noblemen who kept great Quantities of Plate in their Houses wou'd for their own sakes encourage so useful an Undertaking bragging that it was no  SouthSeaBubble  and that he could fairly make a great Fortune by it  Whether he gave out this Report only to amuse People and to hinder them from enquiring any farther into his Affairs or whether he was in earnest and thought to bring it to bear I can't tell but the Thing was generally receiv'd as a Banter or as a Piece of Mr  Wild  's Wit and no farther Steps were taken in it  It was about this time that he projected the carrying on a Trade to  Holland  and  Flanders  and thereupon purchas'd a Sloop and put in one  Roger Json  to command her who had long been one of  Jonathan  's clever Fellows He carry'd over Gold Watches Rings Plate and now and then a Bank or Goldsmith's Note that had been  spoke with  by the way of the Mail His chief Trading Port was  Ostend  where he is particularly well known from thence he usually travell'd up to  Bruges Ghent Brussels  and other great Towns where he brought his Toys and Jewels to Market and then return'd to his Sloops took in a Lading of Hollands  and other Goods and came back to the River of  Thames    It is not to be expected that  Jonathan  and  Roger  would let any one share in the Profits of such an honourable Profession It would have been inconsistent with their Practice who never paid for any thing to pay Custom that would have been reflected upon as idle and foolish No the Cargoe came generally safe to Land the first Night and at a certain House within forty Miles of  NewingtonButs  most Part of the dark Business was acted where Councils were secretly held and the Projects form'd But I hope from what has happen'd some Persons who are well known will have Prudence to take Warning since I can assure them that their Actions are sifting into by Persons of no small Penetration and whom they are not entire Strangers to  But to return from this Digression  Roger  drove on the Business abovementioned but two Years which was owing to an Accident that he himself was the Occasion of It happen'd that by some Negligence or other two Pieces of  Holland  were lost in the shipping them for  England  which when he arriv'd he stopp'd out of his Mate's Wages making him pay for the whole Loss This so provok'd the Mate that he went immediately and gave Information of  Jonn  's running such Quantities of Goods Whereupon  the Vessel was exchequer'd in the River and he was oblig'd to stand a Trial with the King in which he was cast in  l  Damages and so his Trade was put an End to in that particular Way  This Stop brought  Jonathan  again to Consideration he soon miss'd his Returns from  Ostend  and having three Wives living and always a Seraglio of Mistresses no less than half a dozen at a time to maintain according to his Rank and being frequently importun'd and teaz'd by People who had been robb'd to help them to their Goods he ventur'd to dabble a little again but with great Caution and for none but such as he took to be Men of Honour every now and then bringing in an Offering to the Gallows of some idle Rascal who did not mind his Business and who according to his Notions was fit for nothing but hanging  Finding no bad Consequence to proceed from his new Practice it made him bolder and bolder so that he began to think he might go on as before and that he should be connived at in a small time carrying on his Trade with very little Caution he went publickly down to the late Instalment at  Windsor  accompanied by his Lady Madam  Wild  attended by a couple of Footmen in laced Liveries and the Detachment he commanded down upon that Occasion  made as good a Figure both for Dress and Equipage as any People there  As there was a very great Booty brought off safe from that Expedition Mr  Wild  had more than ordinary Court made to him by People of Fashion of both Sexes who sollicited hard to have their Jewels Watches  c  return'd upon a reasonable Composition and his open Way of treating upon this Occasion was the most impudent thing he ever did in Contempt of the late ActHe proceeded fo far as to break off with several People because they wou'd not come up to his Terms and he considerably advanced the Price of stolen Goods for whereas at first he took no more for any thing of Plate than its Value in Weight now he wou'd make People pay something for the Fashion also otherwise they should never have them intending to send them over to  Holland  where they might come to a better Market  Yet no Prosecution follow'd all these daring Proceedings which made him think no doubt that he could do any thing yet he had not long ago a narrow Escape as we shall shew by the following Relation  Jonathan  sitting one Day at an Inn in  Smithfield  observ'd a large Trunk in the Yard and imagining there might be some Things of Value therein he immediately went home and order'd one  Rann  a notorious  Acquaintance to habit himself like a Porter and to endeavour to  speak with it Rann  obeys his Master's Commands and accordingly succeeds The Trunk belong'd to Mr  Jarvis  a Whipmaker in that Neighbourhood who was sending it down to a Dealer in the Country There was in it a great Quantity of rich Linen and other Things for a Wedding Upon Mr  Jarvis  's applying to  Wild  after many Delays he had most of the Goods again for ten Guineas But soon after  Wild  and  Rann  falling out he got him hang'd And the Day before his Execution he sent for Mr  Jarvis  and related to him the above Particulars But Mr  Jarvis  dying soon after  Jonathan  had the good Luck to hear no more of the Matter  But now it being decreed by Providence that  Jonathan  should reign no longer he was infatuated to do a Thing which brought on his DestructionCertain Persons having Information where a considerable Quanty of rich Goods lay supposed to be stolen obtain'd a Warrant for the Seisure of them which was accordingly done Tho'  Jonathan  did not go and claim the Goods as his own he had the Assurance to take out an Action in the Name of  Roger Johnston  to whom he pretended the Goods belong'd and arrested the Person or Persons who seiz'd them Thus he pretended to recover those Goods by Law for possessing which if they  were found upon him the Law would hang him  A Proceeding so barefaced and impudent put certain Persons upon finding out Means of bringing so sturdy a Rogue to Justice  Jonathan  was threaten'd loud which occasion'd a Report all over the Town that he was fled from Justice upon which Occasion he publish'd a bullying Advertisement in some of the News Papers offering a Reward of ten Guineas to any Person who shou'd discover the Author of such a scandalous Report at the same Time he run into all publick Places to shew himself and let the World see that he was not run away as was reportedYet in the midst of all this blustering he was seized and committed to  Newgate    There are some other Circumstances in this Story but as we had it only from his own Mouth that he was malicious against the Persons concerned and endeavour'd to asperse them we shall say no more of it  How far  Roger Johnn  was concern'd with  Wild  at the Time of his Apprehension I leave the World to judge when immediately upon his being committed to  Newgate  an Express was sent over and  Johnn  with another of the Trade came down to  Ostend  and appear'd like Persons of Quality told the News to all about him and swore he'd hang both  Jonathan  and the B who  calls her self his Wife so he takes a Packet and hires her for  Dover  where he arriv'd But as he has hot appear'd publickly in  London  we may very well suppose that the hanging of them was the least Part of his Business  We can't forbear observing something remarkable in the Fate of this Fellow first that he had Opportunities of escaping after he knew that a Prosecution was design'd against him and  secondly  that the Fact for which he died was committed whilst he was a Prisoner in  Newgate  for he was so blind as to imagine that the taking but ten Guineas for the Recovery of the Lace when the Woman offered fifteen or twenty and refusing to accept of any Thing for his own Trouble and also that palliating Speech he made her that he did these Things only  to serve poor People who had been wronged  wou'd have been Circumstances in his Favour when he should come to be tried not considering that he directly by this Action incurr'd the Penalty of the Act of Parliament before quoted which is a Proof that all his former Cunning and Sagacity forsook him when he wanted it most and makes good that Saying  Quem Jupiter vult perdere dementat prius  Jupiter first takes away the Understanding of him whom he has a Mind to destroy  I believe no Malefactor ever stood his Ground so long committing every Day acts  of Felony in Sight of the World so that I've heard him compute that in fifteen Years he had receiv'd near ten thousand Pounds for his Dividend of stoln Goods return'd living all this while in Riot and Voluptuousness  But Vengeance at length overtook him and from the Minute of his being seized his Sense and Resolution fail'd nor was he spirited up by the Hopes of a Reprieve which some People endeavoured to flatter him with and industriously spread such a Rumour about whilst they were trembling lest it should be so because he and they are suppos'd to be no Strangers to each others Practices  We shall not trouble the Readers with any Thing which has already been made Publick concerning this extraordinary Fellow who has made so much Noise in the World therefore we shall conclude with observing that whoever had seen him in the Gaiety of his Life when all his Rogueries were successful and had also been Witness of his deplorable State of Mind after his Condemnation might have drawn a Lesson of Morality from it which perhaps might have been of Use to an Atheist  I say to have seen one remarkable for the Gaiety of his Temper for a vast Depth of Cunning as well as Hardness and personal Courage so chang'd at the Apprehensions of his approaching Death and the great Account which is to follow to have seen him  under the greatest Distractions and Horrors of Mind that human Nature is capable of suffering wou'd be convinc'd that  Virtue only can give true Tranquillity and nothing can support a Man against the Terrors of Death but a good Conscience    A true COPY of a Paper written by JONATHAN WILDE  on  Saturday  the  th  Day of  May    and designed to have been deliver'd by him at the Place of Execution to the Reverend Mr  Edwards  but was prevented by the Draught of  Opium  he took the Night before his Death in the Condemn'd Hold of  Newgate    IT having pleased Almighty God in his Justice to put an End to a most vicious and wicked Course of Life by a shameful and ignominious Death the World will expect some Account of my real Sentiments and Behaviour under so great a Vicissitude  Such as expect any extraordinary Discoveries and Confessions from me will be disappointed for my Affairs are too much confused and my Mind too sadly perplexed to give  me Room to satisfie the Curious in a particular Manner neither do I believe it would be of any publick Advantage except to some few Printers and Publishers  Let it suffice that I have gone on in a long Series of dreadful Guilt and no Crime Treason Murder and Sodomy excepted escaped me for which God's Vengeance has now overtaken me My rash Zeal to serve Mr  Johnson  by directing an Action to be brought for the Recovery of his Effects has facilitated my Fate and utterly undone me by putting me into the Hands and Power of my Enemies That I had previous Notice of their Designs and of Warrants being issued against me is too notorious to be contested and I might have escaped far enough out of their Reach many Times if I had thought my self in any Danger but I am equally surprized with the rest of the World who never thought Matters could have been carried to this Height against me  The Methods I took for to procure a Respite and protract the Time of my Execution were no other than what is natural enough to poor Wretches under the dreadful Sentence of Death and what has been often practised by Malefactors of much greater Rank and Quality than my self I mean my pretending to discover the Persons that robb'd the Exchequer but the Government was wiser and  knew better Things than to be imposed on by so mean and despicable a Criminal  As Mr Recorder was pleased at my Tryal to say that the Clause in the Act of Parliament by which I now fall was directly levelled against me and that himself had frequently admonished me against acting in Contempt of the same I do not pretend to deny it but presuming on the Services I did the Publick by apprehending and bringing to Justice great Numbers of Robbers at the apparent Hazard of my Life I hoped that Law might have been dispensed with and those Services ballance the Inconveniencies arising from my recovering stolen Goods and indeed it was upon this Foundation that I all along acted  I return Thanks to my Neighbours and others who did so readily attend at the  SessionsHouse  to have testified for my Demeanour amongst them if there had been Occasion for it and to all other Persons whatsoever who have assisted me in my Misery and wished well to me  And particularly my dying Thanks to the Reverend Dr  Knight  the Reverend Mr  Nicholson  and the Reverend Mr  Purney  for the great Comforts their Christian Labours have brought to my Soul and to all others who have charitably assisted me to undergo this great Conflict with a Christian Fortitude  The Reason I have to expect ill Treatment from the Poplulace gives me much Uneasiness  and strikes me with great Terror The barbarous Insults I met with from them after my receiving Sentence of Death at the  SessionsHouse  I believe were such as never was shewn before to a Person in my Circumstances in no Country upon Earth I freely forgive them and all the rest of my Enemies whatsoever hoping to meet with Forgiveness for all my enormous Crimes and Offences from the Great God of Mercy and Truth whom I have broughout the whole Course of my Life grievously offended Lord have Mercy upon me Lord receive me  JONATHAN WILDE  FINIS
