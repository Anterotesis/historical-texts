to you  without asking your permission  but it is my knowledge of your diffidence that has prevented that solicitation  As I should however fear to forfeit my claim to your friendship by giving you in public that praise which you shun  in private I must content myself with the hope that you will consider this as an attempt to prove the esteem and regard with which  I am Dear Sir Your most obedient and faithful humble Servant J C  E J H  th March  IT is so usual for the Author of a Dramatic Piece on its Publication to thank the Performers that on some Occasions a Writer might be led to withhold his Acknowledgments left Truth should be considered as mere customary Compliment  The Author of the following Opera is not however subjected to that Risque when he acquits himself of a Duty by giving

COLLETT  LOVE IN THE EAST A COMIC OPERA  ACT I  SCENE I  The Landingplace at Calcutta  A number of people Indians and Europeans walking on the shoreSeveral sailors come to the front of the stage as if just arrived and sing a chorus  CHORUS  HAIL to India's happy shore  Where Nature from her choicest store  Her blessings gives with bounteous hand  And decks with smiles her favourite land  Our dreams of danger now are o'er  Hail to India's happy shore  DUETTO  No more the hidden rocks we fear  No more the whistling winds we hear  Which threaten devastation wide  As Ocean rolls his troubled tide  Da Capo Chorus  Captain COROMANDEL comes forward with STANMORE  STAN  Captain Coromandelonce more welcome to Bengal  CORO  Ah my old friend Stanmore I expected to have seen you in England before nowWell Sir what news in BengalHow is your old friend and patron Colonel Bentley as whimsical as ever  STAN  As well beloved in the settlement as ever I promise you the Colonel's singularities do not cloud his virtueswhile others court esteem he commands itYou know he has long fought under the banner of plain dealing  "CORO  Oh that's a service in which there is but bad payHe won't be able to enlist many recruits"  "STAN  But then the honour"  CORO  "Why as you say if he loves the honour of fighting he will have enoughfor with plain dealing he will be sure to find enemies in plenty every where"And how is the charming young lady whom the Colonel has taken under his patronage  STAN  Ormellina you meanShe is a charming creature indeedbut still unmarried  CORO  I suppose she won't remain so long  the Colonel has no doubt taught her to be obedient in order to train her up for a wife  STAN  A wife No no sir the Colonel is too much a man of honour to think of uniting threescore and eighteen  CORO  But what has honour to do in the business my dear Stanmore  STAN  Not much indeedI think an unfortunate young woman has far less reason to complain of the poor fellow who takes her purse on the highway than of the old dotard who robs her of her happiness under the title of marriage and yet the same laws which encourage her to hang the one command her to honour and obey the other  CORO  You seem to speak feelingly  STAN  I have but too much causethe woman I loved was thus sacrificed  CORO  Pshaw man don't droop because you are separated from your mistress she will love you the better when you meet without a storm now and then we should not enjoy fair weather  AIR I  STANMORE  Ah when safe at home arrived at last  Where oft the maid you love has heard the secret sigh  She fondly hears your tale of dangers past  How sweet to kiss the tear from beauty's eye  With this reward in view what manly bosom fears  To brave the various war which skies and waters wage  The winds the thunder's roar unmoved he hears  While future calms of love his hopes engage  II  Beauty then shall bend at Mirth's gay shrine  Shall hail the festive hour and mock her fond alarms  Your bumper as she fills the nectar'd wine  Becomes the happy mirrour of her charms  With this reward in view c  CORO  Here comes a passenger of mine a taylor with whom I must bring you acquainted I think the fellow will entertain you  Enter TWIST  Mr Stanmore this is Tom Twista very whimlical fellow who not being satisfied with sitting crosslegged in London is resolved to cut out work for himself in Bengal  STAN  I am his most obedientAnd pray Mr Twist what business do you mean to follow in Bengal  "TWIST  The same business which every one else follows in Bengal getting money oh Captain"  "STAN  But in what lineFor there are various ways of carrying on that business  "TWIST  Yes Sir and some of them dd strange ways they tell us in England  "STAN  And pray Mr Twist on what do you mean to depend in becoming a favourite of fortune"  TWIST  Accomplishments SirI can dance a cotillion tolerably sing twenty songs about Jockies and Jennies for the ladies and play Malbrouk on the fiddleIn short I can do every thing but write and read and my genius never could stoop to that  CORO  But tell me how did you acquire these elegant accomplishments  TWIST  You know Sir I always moved in a genteel circleMy master worked for none but people of quality not a tradesman in Westminster could boast of a greater number of book debts  STAN  That must have been a vast happiness  TWIST  Yes old Staytape ruined himself by his great connectionsHe visited some of the first people  CORO  What a taylor visit the first people  TWIST  Aye Sirtwo or three times a day sometimes but he was seldom fortunate enough to meet with them at home they weretoo much engaged in paying off the debts of the nation to attend to their own  CORO  Well Twist a truce with your wit for the present I have promised my friend Mushroom to send you to himHe wishes to have some clothes made up in a hurry and if your needle goes but as fast as your tongue I shall gain credit by recommending you  STAN  Mr Twist I heartily wish you successWe are all three brother adventurers and however different our situations our object is the same  TRIO and CHORUS  TWIST COROMANDEL and STANMORE  We be three who doom'd to roam  Have dared the dang'rous seas  That land becomes our dearest home  Which gives us wealth and ease  No other climes will we explore  Nor search the world around  Our choice is fix'd on India's shore  Our home shall be this ground  Exeunt  SCENE  Colonel BENTLEY's  Enter ORMELLINA and ELIZA  ORM  Once more my dear little adventurer welcome to Bengal Captain Coromandel's letter introduces you to me with the highest encomiums but he omits to tell me what has occasioned you to quit England in this disguise  ELIZA  Ah my dear Ormellina what being is that in the creation for whom woman feels a thousand various emotions who is her blessing and her torment her tyrant and her slave the man she lovesIn short I am come to Bengal in search of a husband no uncommon errand I believe  ORM  But your story  ELIZ  Is told in a few words The prayers and intreaties of an indigent mother forced me to marry where I could not love The object of my affections quitted the kingdom in despair and took passage for BengalMy auld Robin Grey is lately dead I disguised myself thus and embarked for India in the hope of discovering my lover and sharing with him that fortune which I have so dearly acquired  ORM  Generous girlAnd so this lover is my friendEnsign Stanmore But tell me what is this history of me which you say you have heard  ELIZ  That you are an orphaneducated by Colonel Bentley as his daughter  ORM  Well  ELIZ  That your lover's name is Warnfordthat you are jealous of him with a woman of intriguea Mrs Mushroom  "ORM  Who could have told you this  "ELIZ  All that relates to you and Mr Warnford I learned from Mrs Mushroom herself I called at her house just now with a letter of introduction from Captain CoromandelYou seem surprised at my knowledge but I should think very meanly of myself indeed were I to be in any place two hours without learning the scandal of the whole neighbourhood"  ORM  But you have no reason to suppose that Warnford requites her attachment  ELIZ  That I am not sure of  ORM  Oh that I were ascertained of the contrary  AIR  ORMELLINA  Hear me O god of love  Who canst despair control  From jealousy's keen smart  Relieve my tortured soul  Hear me thou mighty pow'r  Far from my troubled breast  Doubts fearful phantoms chase  And soothe my soul to rest  ELIZ  You shall not long remain in suspenceI am now going again to Mrs Mushroom and will contrive to gain information but I vow I had forgot to tell you my name  ORM  Your name  ELIZ  You must know that in order to conceal myself from my lover the more effectually I have assumed this disguise and am at present Alexander M'Proteus at your service  ORM  And why disguise yourself from my poor friend Stanmore  ELIZ  Only till I have perplexed him a littleCoquetry with a lover is like playing with your lapdog "or kitten" The fonder you are of the pretty animal the more delight you feel in teazing it Come come my dear friend I shall make you a convert to my laughing philosophy  ORM  I wish indeed you could  ELIZ  Depend upon it I shall None can pay more sincere homage to Cupid than we laughing lovers You sighing folks make him an eastern despot and fall prostrate before him with us he is an European princewe bow and simper at his levee you degrade him to the mere tyrant of slaves we exalt him to a glorious situationthe monarch of happy subjects  SCENE  MUSHROOM's House  Mr and Mrs MUSHROOM  MUSH  Mrs Mushroom  Mrs MUSH  Well Mr Mushroom  MUSH  Do you dine at home today  Mrs MUSH  Perhaps not  MUSH  You are not resolved then  Mrs MUSH  NoyesnoI won't dine at home  MUSH  I am very glad of it  Mrs MUSH  I shall leave you to expose yourself as much as you please today and not take the trouble of interpreting your nonsense to your company to persuade them you are not a fool  MUSH  They'll never believe me to be otherwise than a fool whilst they remember I married such a precious wife  Mrs MUSH  Well Sir and is it not that precious wife who has introduced you to most of the company you keep in Bengal  MUSH  Yes my dear you have indeed introduced me to all the rakehelly young dogs in the three provinces they stick so close to you that whenever you go out you move like the queen bee with a whole swarm after you  "Mrs MUSH  You don't mean to insinuate that I have wronged your bed Mr Mushroom  "MUSH  Not I my loveI would not insinuate  that  till I have proof of it and I'm afraid you'll take care to keep that out of my reach"  Mrs MUSH  Very well Sir very well but indeed what had I else to expect when I married an illiterate sordid wretch and twenty years older than myself into the bargain  MUSH  Aye that's an unpardonable crime in me I never knew a woman leave age out of the list of a man's faults What an ass was I to marry a broken milliner from Bondstreet who brought out a face as badly patched up as  her reputation for a venture to Bengal besides which she hadn't stock in trade enough to fill one of her own bandboxes  Mrs MUSH  A very fit match Mr Mushroom for an ignorant runaway shopboy with a mind as destitute of ideas as his pockets were of moneyThe whole settlement knows your origin  MUSH  Yes I always meant they should know it I glory in it that there was a time when Martin Mushroom one of the richest men in Bengal had not halfacrown in his pocket nor a whole coat to his backZounds  Mrs MUSH  Don't fly in a passion now  MUSH  Not I egad That we hate each other most heartily you very well know  Mrs MUSH  And the worst part of the story is that we must not own it before company  MUSH  Nothat's a cursed confinement upon us  Mrs MUSH  Well it can't be help'd Mr Mushroom as we are tied together we must make the best of a bad bargain Hush here is somebody coming  Enter SERVANT  SERV  Mr M'Proteus  MUSH  Shew him upDraw your chair closer  Enter ELIZA as M'Proteus  My dear M'Proteus  ELIZ  Ah blessing o' ye're heartsye're a pattern for a' married folk  Mrs MUSH  aside  Yes and a pattern that is pretty much in vogue I believeWe have been talking over some old stories hav'n't we my dear Mr Mushroom  MUSH  Yes my life we always talk them over when we are alone  aside  I shan't be able to keep my temper much longerWell my dear I must leave you for an hour or two if Coromandel should send the taylor let them set him to work to alter my blue and gold and if Colonel Baton should call pray entertain him till I return  Mrs MUSH  Oh that is the French officer you expect from Pondicherri  MUSH  The same my dear He never was in Calcutta before He is a man of gallantry Mr M'Proteusa dangerous man among the ladies  Mrs MUSH  Then I'm resolved to make a conquest of him  aside  How do I look today my dear  MUSH  Much better than you did  aside  before you were painted  Mrs MUSH  Ha ha ha Mr M'Proteus the only looking glass an old married woman has to consult is her husband  ELIZ  You are reight Madamlike a looking glass he'll let ye see aw ye're fauts  Mrs MUSH  Well if you must go good bye love  leaning on Mushroom's shoulder  MUSH  kissing his hand  Adieu my angel You see Sir what it is to have a wife so dd fond of one  Exit  Mrs MUSH  At length we are alone "Oh Mr M'Proteus what an acquisition it is to  have a friend like youThe moment I saw you I discovered that we had kindred minds  "ELIZ  I houp Madam they wunna gree th' war for being relations"  Mrs MUSH  You will recollect I mentioned to you my fears that Mr Warnford might misunderstand my behaviour to him  ELIZ  I remember it perfectly Madam I never forget my friends  Mrs MUSH  Indeed Well that is very disinterested to remember your friends while you  forget yourself  and that you certainly do at this momentWhat is become of that charming Caledonian accent which graced your conversation Ye're reight Madam like a looking glass he'll let ye see aw ye're fauts  mimicking  Ha ha ha  ELIZ  I cry for quarter my dear Madam a slip of the tongue has betrayed me to be sure The truth is love induced me to assume this disguise which I must wear for two or three days You shall then know who and what I am Come madam you need not fear to make me your confidant I am too much in your power for you to apprehend I should deceive you  Mrs MUSH  aside  There is some reason in thatWell M'Proteus I will convince you that I can be generous  ELIZ  Then Madam to the subject of our conversationMr Warnford  Mrs MUSH  Well as I told youI have chatted laughed rallied him and have given into a thousand little levities in which we innocent women indulge without meaning any thing  ELIZ  CertainlyWhy what can you do If a smart fellow will attack you with a  curse me madam but you are a monstrous fine woman  you would not be so ill bred as to blush look foolish and threaten to tell your husband  Mrs MUSH  That would be ill breeding indeed  ELIZ  To be sure Lud why a declaration of love excites a woman to coquetry as naturally as the sound of a fiddle excites her to dance Never mind my dear Madam scandal is a tax on pleasure and if the commodity cannot be smuggled a woman of spirit will rather pay the duty than go without it  Mrs MUSH  But is it not very hard that scandal should attack us women of spirit who instead of shrinking from Temptation boldly meet him put him to the rout and shew the rest of our sex the way to victory and glory My maxim Mr M'Proteus is that virtue should be tried  ELIZ  Therefore I presume Madam you have tried yours  Mrs MUSH  Aye Sir I thank my stars often and oftendo you know  "ELIZ  Ah Madam what a treasure do you possess in such a veteran virtueYou must have great confidence in it"  Mrs MUSH  "ProdigiousI'll give you a proof of it"I mean to give Warnford a private meeting and in my own room too Ha ha you seem surprised but you don't consider that so bold a proposal will argue such a confidence in my own prudence that it must entirely destroy all his hopes of success  "ELIZ  No really I did not think of that  "Mrs MUSH  You have it in your power to witness the purity of my motives in case my conduct should be misconstrued but" I have written a letter to Warnford which I will show you  giving Eliza a letter  Enter LUCY who whispers Mrs MUSHROOM and exit  ELIZ  This will be bad intelligence for my poor friend Ormellina But to the letter  Reading  'I am extremely anxious to remove any prejudice you may have formed to my disadvantage As I think that can be best done by a private interview let me see you as soon as possibleThree raps at my chamberdoor will be your passport to the explanation proposed by MARIA MUSHROOM'  Mrs MUSH  One of Warnford's servants happens fortunately to be in the houseIt will be much better to send it by him than by one of my own people  takes the letter and seals it  Enter ROSARIO  How d'ye do Rosario You must deliver a letter from this gentleman to your master  ROSA  Yes Missee  aside  Dere always be some cus mischief ven Missee be so civil  ELIZ  aside to Mrs Mush  You have not directed the letter  Mrs MUSH  aside to Eliz  It would not be prudent for my handwriting to appear on the directionbesides Rosario supposes the letter yours  ELIZ  Shall I address it then  Mrs MUSH  Oh no that will appear so  strange to Warnfordthere is no necessity for any directionThere Rosariothere is the letter  turning to Eliz  I hope this will set my character in a proper point of view It is really very troublesome for people to fall in love with one in this manneris it not M'Proteus  ELIZ  Faith I don't know Madam love is like money every one abuses it and yet I know not what we should do without it  Exeunt M  Mush and Eliza  ROSARIO  so  s  Ah my mind misgive m  Dis letter be no honest no say any ting o  outsideall white and clean outsidenice and fair like Misseeafraid though it be wicked and

orphan supported and educated by your bounty  BENT  Certainly It is that happy ignorance of her birth which has saved her from the ill effects of my fondness for I am sure if I had once owned her for my daughter I should certainly have spoilt her You know Stanmore I am one of those fools who are vulgarly called goodnatured people and who find themselves involved in a thousand difficulties merely because they can't say  no  to any thing  STANM  Yes I know that is your infirmity  BENT  Whenever a man wanted to borrow a few guineas which he never meant to repay Jack Bentley was the man applied to and I had the exclusive privilege of being pigeon'd by my friends merely because I was the best creature in the world However I soon found it was a damn'd misfortune to be so agreeable so I e'en parted with my character to save my money and affronted my acquaintance to prevent my being obliged to quit society  STANM  Ay there it is nowWhat a pity that goodnature like the dress of an officer in battle should be only a dangerous mark of distinction for the enemy to aim at  BENT  How often have I envied poor Sam Sulky He was a happy fellowblest with the worst temper I ever knew and had the finest forbidding frownnever lent a man a shilling in his lifenobody praised him and he praised nobodyso he grew rich because people did not like his company well enough to ruin him  STANM  Ah Colonel

mistaken I am not benevolentI am illtemper'd Sir and morose and as for all the silly cant of lovers I consider it as the halfform'd dialect of children an abuse of language which they correct as they grow older  WARNF  It is the language of my heart Sir and while that heart beats such must be its effusions  BENT  And so I am to infer from all this that if I refuse my consent you will run away with the girl  WARNF  Why look ye ColonelI will not answer for myselfif Ormellina will agree to it  BENT  aside  A fine fellow i'faith  to him  This is beyond bearing Warnford  WARNF  Nay I predict that

Mrs MUSH  Perhaps indeed relying too far on the purity of my intentions my unsuspecting temper may have betrayed me into a levity of manner or perhaps pardon the supposition but perhaps you in a
