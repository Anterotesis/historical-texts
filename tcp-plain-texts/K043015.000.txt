 THE RIVALS A COMEDY  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE RIVALS A COMEDY As it is ACTED at the TheatreRoyal in CoventGarden  LONDON Printed for JOHN WILKIE No St Paul's ChurchYard MDCCLXXV  PREFACE  A Preface to a Play seems generally to be considered as a kind of Closetprologue in whichif his Piece has been successfulthe Author solicits that indulgence from the Reader which he had before experienced from the Audience But as the scope and immediate object of a Play is to please a mixed assembly in  Representation  whose judgment in the Theatre at least is decisive its degree of reputation is usually as determined as public before it can be prepared for the cooler tribunal of the Study Thus any farther solicitude on the part of the Writer becomes unnecessary at least if not an intrusion and if the Piece has been condemned in the Performance I fear an Address to the Closet like an Appeal to Posterity is constantly regarded as the procrastination of a suit from a consciousness of the weakness of the cause From these considerations the following Comedy would certainly have been submitted to the Reader without any further introduction than what it had in the Representation but that its success has probably been founded on a circumstance which the Author is informed has not before attended a theatrical trial and  which consequently ought not to pass unnoticed  I need scarcely add that the circumstance alluded to was the withdrawing of the Piece to remove those imperfections in the first Representation which were too obvious to escape reprehension and too numerous to admit of a hasty correction There are few writers I believe who even in the fullest consciousness of error do not wish to palliate the faults which they acknowledge and however trifling the performance to second their confession of its deficiencies by whatever plea seems least disgraceful to their ability In the present instance it cannot be said to amount either to candour or modesty in me to acknowledge an extreme inexperience and want of judgment on matters in which without guidance from practice or spur from success a young man should scarcely boast of being an adept If it be said that under such disadvantages no one should attempt to write a playI must beg leave to dissent from the position while the first point of experience that I have gained on the subject is a knowledge of the candour and judgment with which an impartial Public distinguishes between the errors of inexperience and incapacity and the indulgence which it shews even to a disposition to remedy the defects of either  It were unnecessary to enter into any farther extenuation of what was thought exceptionable in this Play but that it has been  said that the Managers should have prevented some of the defects before its appearance to the Publicand in particular the uncommon length of the piece as represented the first nightIt were an ill return for the most liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their side to suffer any censure to rest where none was deserved Hurry in writing has long been exploded as an excuse for an Author however in the dramatic line it may happen that both an Author and a Manager may wish to fill a chasm in the entertainment of the Public with a hastiness not altogether culpable The season was advanced when I first put the play into Mr Harris's handsit was at that time at least double the length of any acting comedyI profited by his judgment and experience in the curtailing of it'till I believe his feeling for the vanity of a young Author got the better of his desire for correctness and he left many excrescences remaining because he had assisted in pruning so many more Hence though I was not uninformed that the Acts were still too long I flatter'd myself that after the first trial I might with safer judgment proceed to remove what should appear to have been most dissatisfactoryMany other errors there were which might in part have arisen from my being by no means conversant with plays in general either in reading or at the theatreYet I own that in one respect I did not regret my ignorance for as my first wish in attempting a Play was to avoid every appearance  of plagiary I thought I should stand a better chance of effecting this from being in a walk which I had not frequented and where consequently the progress of invention was less likely to be interrupted by starts of recollection for on subjects on which the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exerting itselfFaded ideas float in the fancy like halfforgotten dreams and the imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted  With regard to some particular passages which on the First Night's Representation seemed generally disliked I confess that if I felt any emotion of surprise at the disapprobation it was not that they were disapproved of but that I had not before perceived that they deserved it As some part of the attack on the Piece was begun too early to pass for the sentence of  Judgment  which is ever tardy in condemning it has been suggested to me that much of the disapprobation must have arisen from virulence of Malice rather than severity of Criticism But as I was more apprehensive of there being just grounds to excite the latter than conscious of having deserved the former I continue not to believe that probable which I am sure must have been unprovoked However if it was so and I could even mark the quarter from whence it came it would be ungenerous to retort for no passion suffers more than  malice from disappointment For my own part I see no reason why the Author of a Play should not regard a First Night's Audience as a candid and judicious friend attending in behalf of the Public at his last Rehearsal If he can dispense with flattery he is sure at least of sincerity and even though the annotation be rude he may rely upon the justness of the comment Considered in this light that Audience whose  fiat  is essential to the Poet's claim whether his object be Fame or Profit has surely a right to expect some deference to its opinion from principles of Politeness at least if not from Gratitude  As for the little puny Critics who scatter their peevish strictures in private circles and scribble at every Author who has the eminence of being unconnected with them as they are usually spleenswoln from a vain idea of increasing their consequence there will always be found a petulance and illiberality in their remarks which should place them as far beneath the notice of a Gentleman as their original dulness had sunk them from the level of the most unsuccessful Author  It is not without pleasure that I catch at an opportunity of justifying myself from the charge of intending any national reflection in the character of Sir  Lucius O'Trigger  If any Gentlemen opposed the Piece from that idea I thank them sincerely for their opposition and if the condemnation of this Comedy however misconceived the provocation could  have added one spark to the decaying flame of national attachment to the country supposed to be reflected on I should have been happy in its fate and might with truth have boasted that it had done more real service in its failure than the successful morality of a thousand stagenovels will ever effect  It is usual I believe to thank the Performers in a new Play for the exertion of their several abilities But where as in this instance their merit has been so striking and uncontroverted as to call for the warmest and truest applause from a number of judicious Audiences the Poet's afterpraise comes like the feeble acclamation of a child to close the shouts of a multitude The conduct however of the Principals in a Theatre cannot be so apparent to the PublicI think it therefore but justice to declare that from this Theatre the only one I can speak of from experience those Writers who wish to try the Dramatic Line will meet with that candour and liberal attention which are generally allowed to be better calculated to lead genius into excellence than either the precepts of judgment or the guidance of experience  THE AUTHOR  PROLOGUE  BY THE AUTHOR  Spoken by Mr WOODWARD and Mr QUICK  Enter Serjeant at Law and Attorney  Serj  WHAT's herea vile cramp hand I cannot see  Without my

a book in her hand  Lucy  as just returned from a message  Luc  Indeed Ma'am I transferr'd half the town in search of itI don't believe there's a circulating library in Bath I ha'n't been at  Lyd  And could not you get '  The Reward of Constancy  '  Lucy  No indeed Ma'am  Lyd  Nor  'The Fatal Connection'  Lucy  No indeed Ma'am  Lyd  Nor  'The Mistakes of the Heart'  Lucy  Ma'am as illluck would have it Mr Bull said Miss Sukey Saunter had just fetch'd it away  Lyd  HeighhoDid you inquire for '  The Delicate Distress  '  Lucy  Or '  The Memoirs of Lady Woodford  ' Yes indeed Ma'amI ask'd every where for it and I might have brought it from Mr Frederick's but Lady Slattern Lounger who had just sent it home had so soiled and dog'sear'd it it wa'n't fit for a christian to read  Lyd  HeighhoYes I always know when Lady Slattern has been before meShe has a most observing thumb and I believe cherishes her nails for the convenience of making marginal notes Well child what  have  you brought me  Lucy  On here Ma'am  Taking books from under her cloke and from her pockets  This is  'The Gordian Knot'  and this  'Peregrine Pickle'  Here are  'The Tears of Sensibility'  and  'Humphry Clinker'  This is  'The Memoirs of a Lady of Quality written by herself'  and here the second volume of  'The Sentimental Journey'  Lyd  HeighhoWhat are those books by the glass  Lucy  The great one is only '  The whole Duty of Man  'where I press a few blonds Ma'am  Lyd  Very wellgive me the  sal volatile  Lucy  Is it in a blue cover Ma'am  Lyd  My smelling bottle you simpleton  Lucy  O the dropshere Ma'am  Lyd  No note Lucy  Lucy  No indeed Ma'ambut I have seen a certain person  Lyd  What my Beverleywell Lucy  Lucy  O Ma'am he looks so desponding and melancholic  Lyd  Hold Lucyhere's some one coming quick see who it is    Exit  Lucy  Surely I heard my cousin Julia's voice  Reenter  Lucy  Lucy  Lud Ma'am here is Miss Melville  Lyd  Is it possible  Enter  Julia  Lyd  My dearest Julia how delighted am I  Embrace  How unexpected was this happiness  Jul  True Lydiaand our pleasure is the greaterbut what has been the matteryou were denied to me at first  Lyd  Ah Julia I have a thousand things to tell youbut first inform me what has conjur'd you to BathIs Sir Anthony here  Jul  He iswe are arrived within this hour and I suppose he will be here to wait on Mrs Malaprop as soon as he is dress'd  Lyd  Then before we are interrupted let me impart to you some of my distressI know your gentle nature will sympathize with me tho' your prudence may condemn meMy letters have inform'd you of my whole connexion with Beverley but I have lost him Juliamy aunt has discover'd  our intercourse by a note she intercepted and has confin'd me ever sinceYet would you believe it she has fallen absolutely in love with a tall Irish baronet she met one night since we have been here at Lady Macshuffle's rout  Jul  You jest Lydia  Lyd  No upon my wordShe absolutely carries on a kind of correspondence with him under a feigned name though till she chuses to be known to himbut it is a  Delia  or a  Celia  I assure you  Jul  Then surely she is now more indulgent to her niece  Lyd  Quite the contrary Since she has discovered her own frailty she is become more suspicious of mine Then I must inform you of another plagueThat odious Acres is to be in Bath today so that I protest I shall be teased out of all spirits  Jul  Come come Lydia hope the bestSir Anthony shall use his interest with Mrs Malaprop  Lyd  But you have not heard the worst Unfortunately I had quarrell'd with my poor Beverley just before my aunt made the discovery and I have not seen him since to make it up  Jul  What was his offence  Lyd  Nothing at allBut I don't know how it was as often as we had been together we had never had a quarrelAnd somehow I was afraid he would never give me an opportunitySo last Thursday I wrote a letter to myself to inform myself that Beverley was at that time paying his addresses to another womanI sign'd it  your Friend unknown  shew'd it to Beverley charg'd him with his falsehood put myself in a violent passion and vow'd I'd never see him more  Jul  And you let him depart so and have not seen him since  Lyd  'Twas the next day my aunt found the matter out I intended only to have teased him three days and a half and now I've lost him for ever  Jul  If he is as deserving and sincere as you have represent  d him to me he will never give you up so Yet consider Lydia you tell me he is but an ensign and you have thirty thousand pounds  Lyd  But you know I lose most of my fortune if I marry without my aunt's consent till of age and that is what I have determin'd to do ever since I knew the penaltyNor could I love the man who would wish to wait a day for the alternative  Jul  Nay this is caprice  Lyd  What does Julia tax me with caprice I thought her lover Faulkland had enured her to it  Jul  I do not love even  his  faults  Lyd  But aproposyou have sent to him I suppose  Jul  Not yet upon my wordnor has he the least idea of my being in BathSir Anthony's resolution was so sudden I could not inform him of it  Lyd  Well Julia you are your own mistress though under the protection of Sir Anthony yet have you for this long year been the slave to the caprice the whim the jealousy of this ungrateful Faulkland who will ever delay assuming the right of a husband while you suffer him to be equally imperious as a lover  Jul  Nay you are wrong entirelyWe were contracted before my father's death  That  and some consequent embarrassments have delay'd what I know to be my Faulkland's most ardent wish He is too generous to trifle on such a point And for his character you wrong him there too  No Lydia he is too proud too noble to be jealous if he is captious 'tis without dissembling if fretful without rudenessUnus'd to the soppery of love he is negligent of the little duties expected from a loverbut being unhackney'd in the passion his love is ardent and sincere and as it engrosses his whole soul he expects every thought and emotion of his mistress to move in unison with hisYet though his pride calls for this full return his humility makes him undervalue those qualities in him which should entitle him to it and not feeling why he should be lov'd to the degree he wishes he still suspects that he is not lov'd enough This temper I must own has cost me many unhappy hours but I have learn'd to think myself his debtor for those imperfections which arise from the ardour of his love  Lyd  Well I cannot blame you for defending himBut tell me candidly Julia had he never sav'd your life do you think you should have been attach'd to him as you areBelieve me the rude blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale of love to him  Jul  Gratitude may have strengthened my attachment to Mr Faulkland but I lov'd him before he had preserv'd me yet surely that alone were an obligation sufficient  Lyd  ObligationWhy a waterspaniel would have done as muchWell I should never think of giving my heart to a man because he could swim  Jul  Come Lydia you are too inconsiderate  Lyd  Nay I do but jestWhat's here  Enter  Lucy  in a hurry  Lucy  O Ma'am here is Sir Anthony Absolute just come home with your aunt  Lyd  They'll not come hereLucy do you watch    Exit  Lucy  Jul  Yet I must goSir Anthony does not know I am here and if we meet he'll detain me to shew me the townI'll take another opportunity of paying my respects to Mrs Malaprop when she shall treat me as long as she chooses with her select words so ingeniously  misapplied  without being  mispronounced  Reenter  Lucy  Lucy  O Lud Ma'am they are both coming up stairs  Lyd  Well I'll not detain you CozAdieu my dear Julia I'm sure you are in haste to send to FaulklandTherethrough my room you'll find another staircase  Jul  Adieu  Embrace      Exit  Julia  Lyd  Here my dear Lucy hide these books Quick quickFling  Peregrine Pickle  under the toiletthrow  Roderick Random  in to the closetput  the Innocent Adultery  into  The Whole Duty of Man  thrust  Lord Aimworth  under the sophacram  Ovid  behind the bolsterthereput  the Man of Feeling  into your pocketso so now lay  Mrs Chapone  in sight and leave  Fordyce's Sermons  open on the table  Lucy  O burn it Ma'am the hairdresser has torn away as far as  Proper Pride  Lyd  Never mindopen at  Sobriety  Fling me  Lord Chesterfield's Letters  Now for 'em  Enter Mrs  Malaprop  and Sir  Anthony Absolute  Mrs Mal  There Sir Anthony there sits the deliberate Simpleton who wants to disgrace her family and lavish herself on a fellow not worth a shilling  Lyd  Madam I thought you once  Mrs Mal  You thought MissI don't know any business you have to think at allthought does not become a young woman the point we would request of you is that you will promise to forget this fellowto illiterate him I say quite from your memory  Lyd  Ah Madam our memories are independent of our willsIt is not so easy to forget  Mrs Mal  But I say it is Miss there is nothing on earth so easy as to  forget  if a person chooses to set about itI'm sure I have as much forgot your poor dear uncle as if he had never existedand I thought it my duty so to do and let me tell you Lydia these violent memories don't become a young woman  Sir Anth  Why sure she won't pretend to remember what she's order'd notaye this comes of her reading  Lyd  What crime Madam have I committed to be treated thus  Mrs Mal  Now don't attempt to extirpate yourself from the matter you know I have proof controvertible of itBut tell me will you promise to do as you're bidWill you take a husband of your friends choosing  Lyd  Madam I must tell you plainly that had I no preference for any one else the choice you have made would be my aversion  Mrs Mal  What business have you Miss with  preference  and  aversion  They don't become a young woman and you ought to know that as both always wear off 'tis safest in matrimony to begin with a little  aversion  I am sure I hated your poor dear uncle before marriage as if he'd been a blackamoorand yet Miss you are sensible what a wife I madeand when it pleas'd Heav'n to release me from him 'tis unknown what tears I shedBut suppose we were going to give you  another choice will you promise us to give up this Beverley  Lyd  Could I belie my thoughts so far as to give that promise my actions would certainly as far belie my words  Mrs Mal  Take yourself to your roomYou are fit company for nothing but your own illhumours  Lyd  Willingly Ma'amI cannot change for the worse    Exit  Lydia  Mrs Mal  There's a little intricate hussy for you  Sir Anth  It is not to be wonder'd at Ma'am all this is the natural consequence of teaching girls to readHad I a thousand daughters by Heavens I'd as soon have them taught the blackart as their alphabet  Mrs Mal  Nay nay Sir Anthony you are an absolute misanthropy  Sir Anth  In my way hither Mrs Malaprop I observed your niece's maid coming forth from a circulating libraryShe had a book in each hand they were halfbound volumes with marbled coversFrom that moment I guess'd how full of duty I should see her mistress  Mrs Mal  Those are vile places indeed  Sir Anth  Madam a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledgeIt blossoms through the yearAnd depend on it Mrs Malaprop that they who are so fond of handling the leaves will long for the fruit at last  Mrs Mal  Well but Sir Anthony your wife Lady Absolute was fond of books  Sir Anth  Ayeand injury sufficient they were to her MadamBut were I to chuse another helpmate the extent of her erudition should consist in her knowing her simple letters without their  mischievous combinationsand the summit of her science beher ability to count as far as twentyThe first Mrs Malaprop would enable her to work  A A  upon my linenand the latter would be quite sufficient to prevent her giving me a shirt No and a stock No  Mrs Mal  Fie fie Sir Anthony you surely speak laconically  Sir Anth  Why Mrs Malaprop in moderation now what would you have a woman know  Mrs Mal  Observe me Sir AnthonyI would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning I don't think so much learning becomes a young woman for instanceI would never let her meddle with Greek or Hebrew or Algebra or Simony or Fluxions or Paradoxes or such inflammatory branches of learningneither would it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical astronomical diabolical instruments But Sir Anthony I would send her at nine years old to a boardingschool in order to learn a little ingenuity and artificeThen Sir she should have a supercilious knowledge in accountsand as she grew up I would have her instructed in geometry that she might know something of the contagious countriesbut above all Sir Anthony she should be mistress of orthodoxy that she might not misspell and mispronounce words so shamefully as girls usually do and likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning of what she is sayingThis Sir Anthony is what I would have a woman knowand I don't think there is a superstitious article in it  Sir Anth  Well well Mrs Malaprop I will dispute the point no further with you though I must confess that you are a truly moderate and polite arguer for almost every third word you say is  on my side of the questionBut Mrs Malaprop to the more important point in debateyou say you have no objection to my proposal  Mrs Mal  None I assure youI am under no positive engagement with Mr Acres and as Lydia is so obstinate against him perhaps your son may have better success  Sir Anth  Well Madam I will write for the boy directlyHe knows not a syllable of this yet though I have for some time had the proposal in my head He is at present with his regiment  Mrs Mal  We have never seen your son Sir Anthony but I hope no objection on his side  Sir Anth  Objectionlet him object if he dare No no Mrs Malaprop Jack knows that the least demur puts me in a frenzy directlyMy process was always very simplein their younger days 'twas 'Jack do this'if he demur'dI knock'd him downand if he grumbled at that I always sent him out of the room  Mrs Mal  Aye and the properest way o' my consciencenothing is so conciliating to young people as severityWell Sir Anthony I shall give Mr Acres his discharge and prepare Lydia to receive your son's invocationsand I hope you will represent  her  to the Captain as an object not altogether illegible  Sir Anth  Madam I will handle the subject prudentlyWell I must leave youand let me beg you Mrs Malaprop to enforce this matter roundly to the girltake my advicekeep a tight hand if she rejects this proposalclap her under lock and keyand if you were just to let the servants forget to bring her dinner for three or four days you can't conceive

necessities of his fortune  Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Captain  Absolute  's Lodgings  Captain  Absolute  and  Fag  Fag  SIR while I was there Sir Anthony came in I told him you had sent me to inquire after his health and to know if he was at leisure to see you  Abs  And what did he say on hearing I was at Bath  Fag  Sir in my life I never saw an elderly gentleman more astonished He started back two or three paces rapt out a dozen interjectoral oaths and asked what the devil had brought you here  Abs  Well Sir and what did you say  Fag  O I lied SirI forgot the precise lie but you may depend on't he got no truth from me Yet with submission for fear of blunders in future I should be glad to fix what  has  brought us to Bath in order that we may lie a little consistently Sir Anthony's servants were curious Sir very curious indeed  Abs  You have said nothing to them  Fag  O not a word Sirnot a wordMr Thomas indeed the coachman whom I take to be the discreetest of whips  Abs  S'deathyou rascal you have not trusted him  Fag  O  no  Sirnononot a syllable upon my veracityHe was indeed a little inquisitive but I was fly Sirdevilish flyMy Master said I honest Thomas you know Sir one says  honest  to one's inferiors is come to Bath to  recruit  Yes SirI said  to recruit  and whether for men money or constitution you know Sir is nothing to him nor any one else  Abs  Well  recruit  will dolet it be so  Fag  O Sir recruit will do surprisinglyindeed to give the thing an air I told Thomas that your Honour had already inlisted five disbanded chairmen seven minority waiters and thirteen billiard markers  Abs  You blockhead never say more than is necessary  Fag  I beg pardon SirI beg pardonBut with submission a lie is nothing unless one supports itSir whenever I draw on my invention for a good current lie I always forge  indorsements  as well as the bill  Abs  Well take care you don't hurt your credit by offering too much securityIs Mr Faulkland returned  Fag  He is above Sir changing his dress  Abs  Can you tell whether he has been informed of Sir Anthony's and Miss Melville's arrival  Fag  I fancy not Sir he has seen no one since he came in but his gentleman who was with him at BristolI think Sir I hear Mr Faulkland coming down  Abs  Go tell him I am here  Fag  Yes Sir  going  I beg pardon Sir but should Sir Anthony call you will do me the favour to remember that we are  recruiting  if you please  Abs  Well well  Fag  And in tenderness to my character if your Honour could bring in the chairman and waiters I shall esteem it as an obligationfor though I never scruple a lie to serve my Master yet it  hurts  one's conscience to be found out  Exit  Abs  Now for my whimsical friendif he does not know that his mistress is here I'll tease him a little before I tell him  Enter  Faulkland  Faulkland you're welcome to Bath again you are punctual in your return  Faulk  Yes I had nothing to detain me when I had finished the business I went on Well what news since I left you How stand matters between you and Lydia  Abs  Faith much as they were I have not seen her since our quarrel however I expect to be recalled every hour  Faulk  Why don't you persuade her to go off with you at once  Abs  What and lose two thirds of her fortune You forget that my friendNo no I could have brought her to that long ago  Faulk  Nay then you trifle too longif you are sure of  her  propose to the aunt  in your own character  and write to Sir Anthony for his consent  Abs  Softly softly for though I am convinced my little Lydia would elope with me as Ensign Beverley yet am I by no means certain that she would take me with the impediment of our friend's consent a regular humdrum wedding and the reversion of a good fortune on my side no no I must prepare her gradually for the discovery and make myself necessary to her before I risk it Well but Faulkland you'll dine with us today at the Hotel  Faulk  Indeed I cannot I am not in spirits to be of such a party  Abs  By Heavens I shall forswear your company You are the most teasing captious incorrigible loverDo love like a man  Faulk  I own I am unfit for company  Abs  Am not  I  a lover aye and a romantic one too Yet do I carry every where with me such a confounded farago of doubts fears hopes wishes and all the flimsy furniture of a country Miss's brain  Faulk  Ah Jack your heart and soul are not like mine fixed immutably on one only object You throw for a large stake but losingyou could stake and throw againbut I have set my sum of happiness on this cast and not to succeed were to be stript of all  Abs  But for Heaven's sake what grounds for apprehension can your whimsical brain conjure up at present Has Julia miss'd writing this last post or was her last too tender or too cool or too grave or too gay or  Faulk  Nay nay Jack  Abs  Why her loveher honourher prudence you cannot doubt  Faulk  O upon my soul I never havebut what grounds for apprehension did you say Heavens are there not a thousand I fear for her spiritsher healthher lifeMy absence may fret her her anxiety for my return her fears for me may oppress her gentle temper And for her healthdoes not every hour bring me cause to be alarmed If it rains some shower may even then have chilled her delicate frameIf the wind be keen some rude blast may have affected her The heat of noon the dews of the evening may endanger the life of her for whom only I value mine O Jack when delicate and feeling souls are separated there is not a feature in the sky not  a movement of the elements not an aspiration of the breeze but hints some cause for a lover's apprehension  Abs  Aye but we may choose whether we will take the hint or noWell then Faulkland if you were convinced that Julia was well and in spirits you would be entirely content  Faulk  I should be happy beyond measure I'm anxious only for that  Abs  Then to cure your anxiety at onceMiss Melville is in perfect health and is at this moment in Bath  Faulk  Nay Jackdon't trifle with me  Abs  She is arrived here with my father within this hour  Faulk  Can you be serious  Abs  I thought you knew Sir Anthony better than to be surprised at a sudden

the advantage of me I had almost fretted myself ill  Abs  Now are you angry with your mistress for not having been sick  Faulk  No no you misunderstand meyet surely a little trifling indisposition is not an unnatural consequence of absence from those we love Now confessisn't there something unkind in this violent robust unfeeling health  Abs  O it was very unkind of her to be well in your absence

should be glad to hear my mistress had been so merry  Sir  Faulk  Nay nay nayI am not sorry that she has been happyno no I am glad of thatI would not have had her sad or sickyet surely a sympathetic heart would have shewn itself even in the choice of a songshe might have been temperately healthy and somehow plaintively gaybut she has been dancing too I doubt not  Acres  What does the gentleman

didn't invent it myself though but a commander in our militiaa great scholar I assure yousays that there is no meaning in the common oaths and that nothing but their antiquity makes them respectablebecause he says the ancients would never stick to an oath or two but would say By Jove or by Bacchus or by Mars or by Venus or by Pallas according to the sentiment so that to swear with propriety says my little Major the 'oath should be an echo to the sense' and this we call the  oath referential  or  sentimental swearing  ha ha ha 'tis genteel isn't it  Abs  Very genteel and very

recollect you before hinted something about a hump or two one eye and a few more graces of that kindnow without being very nice I own I should rather chuse a wife of mine to have the usual number of limbs and a limited quantity of back and tho'  one  eye may be very agreeable yet as the prejudice has always run in favour of  two  I would not wish to affect a singularity in that article  Sir Anth

egad I'll marry the girl myself  Exeunt  SCENE II  Julia  's Dressingroom  Faulkland  solus  Faulk  They told me Julia would return directly wonder she is not yet comeHow mean does this captious unsatisfied temper of mine appear to my cooler judgment Yet I know not that I indulge it in any other pointbut on this one subject and to this one object whom I think I love beyond my life I am ever ungenerously fretful and madly capriciousI am conscious of ityet I cannot correct myself What tender honest joy sparkled in her eyes when we metHow delicate  was the warmth of her expressionsI was ashamed to appear less happythough I had come resolved to wear a face of coolness and upbraiding Sir Anthony's presence prevented my proposed expostulationsyet I must be satisfied that she has not been so  very  happy in my absenceShe is comingYesI know the nimbleness of her tread when she thinks her impatient Faulkland counts the moments of her stay  Enter  Julia  Jul  I had not hop'd to see you again so soon  Faulk  Could I Julia be contented with my first welcomerestrained as we were by the presence of a third person  Jul  O Faulkland when your kindness can make me thus happy let me not think that I discovered more coolness in your first salutation than my longhoarded joy could have presaged  Faulk  'Twas but your fancy JuliaI  was  rejoiced to see youto see you in such healthSure I had no cause for coldness  Jul  Nay then I see you have taken something illYou must not conceal from me what it is  Faulk  Well thenshall I own to youbut you will despise me Julianay I despise myself for itYet I  will  own that my joy at hearing of your health and arrival here by your neighbour Acres was something damped by his dwelling much on the high spirits you had enjoyed in Devonshireon your mirthyour singingdancing and I know not whatFor such is my temper Julia that I should regard every mirthful moment in your absence as a treason to constancy The mutual tear that steals down the cheek of parting lovers is a compact that no smile shall live there till they meet again  Jul  Must I never cease to tax my Faulkland with this teasing minute capriceCan the idle reports of a silly boor weigh in your breast against my tried affection  Faulk  They have no weight with me Julia no noI am happy if you have been soyet only say that you did not sing with  mirth  say that you  thought  of Faulkland in the dance  Jul  I never can be happy in your absence If I wear a countenance of content it is to shew that my mind holds no doubt of my Faulkland's truthIf I seem'd sadit were to make malice triumph and say that I had fixed my heart on one who left me to lament his roving and my own credulityBelieve me Faulkland I mean not to upbraid you when I say that I have often dressed sorrow in smiles lest my friends should guess whose unkindness had caused my tears  Faulk  You were ever all goodness to meO I am a brute when I but admit a doubt of your true constancy  Jul  If ever without such cause from you as I will not suppose possible you find my affections veering but a point may I become a proverbial scoff for levity and base ingratitude  Faulk  Ah Julia that  last  word is grating to me I would I had no title to your  gratitude  Search your heart Julia perhaps what you have mistaken for Love is but the warm effusion of a too thankful heart  Jul  For what quality must I love you  Faulk  For no quality To regard me for any quality of mind or understanding were only to  esteem  me And for personI have often wish'd myself deformed to be convinced that I owed no obligation  there  for any part of your affection  Jul  Where Nature has bestowed a shew of nice attention in the features of a man he should laugh  at it as misplaced I have seen men who in  this  vain article perhaps might rank above you but my heart has never asked my eyes if it were so or not  Faulk  Now this is not well from  you  JuliaI despise person in a manYet if you lov'd me as I wish though I were an Aethiop you'd think none so fair  Jul  I see you are determined to be unkind The  contract  which my poor father bound us in gives you more than a lover's privilege  Faulk  Again Julia you raise ideas that feed and justify my doubtsI would not have been more freenoI am proud of my restraint Yetyetperhaps your high respect alone for this solemn compact has fettered your inclinations which else had made worthier choiceHow shall I be sure had you remained unbound in thought and promise that I should still have been the object of your persevering love  Jul  Then try me nowLet us be free as strangers as to what is past  my  heart will not feel more liberty  Faulk  There now so hasty Julia so anxious to be freeIf your love for me were fixed and ardent you would not loose your hold even tho' I wish'd it  Jul  O you torture me to the heartI cannot bear it  Faulk  I do not mean to distress youIf I lov'd you less I should never give you an uneasy momentBut hear meAll my fretful doubts arise from thisWomen are not used to weigh and separate the motives of their affectionsthe cold dictates of prudence gratitude or filial duty may sometimes be mistaken for the pleadings of the heartI would not boastyet let me say that I have neither age person or character to found  dislike onmy fortune such as few ladies could be charged with  indiscretion  in the matchO Julia when  Love  receives such countenance from  Prudence  nice minds will be suspicious of its  birth  Jul  I know not whither your insinuations would tendas they seem pressing to insult meI will spare you the regret of having done soI have given you no cause for this  Exit in Tears  Faulk  In Tears stay Julia stay but for a momentThe door is fastenedJulia my soulbut for one momentI hear her sobbing'Sdeath what a brute am I to use her thus Yet stayAyeshe is coming nowhow little resolution there is in womanhow a few soft words can turn themNo faithshe is  not  coming eitherWhy Juliamy love say but that you forgive mecome but to tell me thatnow this is being  too  resentfulstay she  is  coming tooI thought she wouldno  steadiness  in any thing her going away must have been a mere trick thenshe sha'n't see that I was hurt by itI'll affect indifference  hums a tune then listens  NoZds she's  not  coming nor don't intend it I supposeThis is not  steadiness  but  obstinacy  Yet I deserve itWhat after so long an absence to quarrel with her tenderness 'twas barbarous and unmanlyI should be ashamed to see her nowI'll wait till her just resentment is abatedand when I distress her so again may I lose her for ever and be linked instead to some antique virago whose knawing passions and longhoarded spleen shall make me curse my folly half the day and all the night  Exit  SCENE III  Mrs  Malaprop's  Lodgings  Mrs  Malaprop  and Captain  Absolute  Mrs Mal  Your being Sir Anthony's son Captain would itself be a sufficient accommodationbut from the ingenuity of your appearance I am convinced you deserve the character here given of you  Abs  Permit me to say Madam that as I never yet have had the pleasure of seeing Miss Languish my principal inducement in this affair at present is the honour of being allied to Mrs Malaprop of whose intellectual accomplishments elegant manners and unaffected learning no tongue is silent  Mrs Mal  Sir you do me infinite honour I beg Captain you'll be seated  Sit  Ah few gentlemen now a days know how to value the ineffectual qualities in a woman few think how a little knowledge become a gentlewoman Men have no sense now but for the worthless flower beauty  Abs  It is but too true indeed Ma'amyet I fear our ladies should share the blamethey think our admiration of  beauty  so great that  knowledge  in  them  would be superfluous Thus like gardentrees they seldom shew fruits till time has robb'd them of the more specious blossomFew like Mrs Malaprop and the Orangetree are rich in both at once  Mrs Mal  Siryou overpower me with goodbreedingHe is the very Pineapple of politeness You are not ignorant Captain that this giddy girl has somehow contrived to fix her affections on a beggarly strolling eve'sdropping Ensign  whom none of us have seen and nobody knows any thing of  Abs  O I have heard the silly affair before I'm not at all prejudiced against her on  that  account  Mrs Mal  You are very good and very considerate CaptainI am sure I have done every thing in my power since I exploded the affair long ago I laid my positive conjunction on her never to think on the fellow againI have since laid Sir Anthony's preposition before herbut I'm sorry to say she seems resolved to decline every particle that I enjoin her  Abs  It must be very distressing indeed Ma'am  Mrs Mal  It gives me the hydrostatics to such a degreeI thought she had persisted from corresponding with him but behold this very day I have interceded another letter from the fellow I believe I have it in my pocket  Abs  O the devil my last note  Aside  Mrs Mal  Aye here it is  Abs  Aye my note indeed O the little traitress Lucy  Aside  Mrs Mal  There perhaps you may know the writing  Gives him the letter  Abs  I think I have seen the hand beforeyes I  certainly must  have seen this hand before  Mrs Mal  Nay but read it Captain  Abs  Reads  My soul's idol my ador'd Lydia    Very tender indeed  Mrs Mal  Tender aye and prophane too o' my conscience  Abs  I am excessively alarmed at the intelligence you send me the more so as my new rival    Mrs Mal  That's  you  Sir  has universally the character of being an accomplished gentleman and a man of honour    Well that's handsome enough  Mrs Mal  O the fellow had some design in writing so  Abs  That he had I'll answer for him Ma'am  Mrs Mal  But go on Siryou'll see presently  Abs  As for the old weatherbeaten shedragon who guards you    Who can he mean by that  Mrs Mal  Me  Sir  me  he means  me  there what do you think nowbut go on a little further  Abs  Impudent scoundrel    it shall go hard but I will elude her vigilance as I am told that the same ridiculous vanity which makes her dress up her coarse features and deck her dull chat with hard words which she don't understand  Mrs Mal  There Sir an attack upon my language what do you think of thatan aspersion upon my parts of speech was ever such a brute save if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue and a nice derangement of epitaphs  Abs  He deserves to be hang'd and quartered let me see  same ridiculous vanity    Mrs Mal  You need not read it again Sir  Abs  I beg pardon Ma'am  does also lay her open to the grossest deceptions from flattery and pretended admiration    an impudent coxcomb  so that I have a scheme to see you shortly with the old Harridan's consent and even to make her a go between in our interviews    Was ever such assurance  Mrs Mal  Did you ever hear any thing like it he'll elude my vigilance will heyes yes ha ha he's very likely to enter these floors we'll try who can plot best  Abs  Ha ha had a conceited puppy ha ha haWell but Mrs Malaprop as the girl seems so infatuated by this fellow suppose you were to wink at her corresponding with him for  a little timelet her even plot an elopement with himthen do you connive at her escapewhile  I  just in the nick will have the fellow laid by the heels and fairly contrive to carry her off in his stead  Mrs Mal  I am delighted with the scheme never was any thing better perpetrated  Abs  But pray could not I see the lady for a few minutes nowI should like to try her temper a little  Mrs Mal  Why I don't knowI doubt she is not prepared for a first visit of this kind There is a decorum in these matters  Abs  O Lord she won't mind  me  only tell her Beverley  Mrs Mal  Sir  Abs  Gently good tongue  Aside  Mrs Mal  What did you say of Beverley  Abs  O I was going to propose that you should tell her by way of jest that it was Beverley who was belowshe'd come down fast enough thenha ha ha  Mrs Mal  'Twould be a trick she welldeserves besides you know the fellow tells her he'll get my consent to see herha haLet him if he can I say againLydia come down here  Calling  He'll make me a  gobetween in their interviews  ha ha ha Come down I say LydiaI don't wonder at your laughing ha ha ha his impudence is truly ridiculous  Abs  'Tis very ridiculous upon my soul Ma'am ha ha ha  Mrs Mal  The little hussy won't hearWell I'll go and tell her at once who it isshe shall know that Capt Absolute is come to wait on her And I'll make her behave as becomes a young woman  Abs  As you please Ma'am  Mrs Mal  For the present Captain your servantAh you've not done laughing yet I see  elude my vigilance  yes yes ha ha ha  Exit  Abs  Ha ha ha one would think now that I might throw off all disguise at once and seize my prize with securitybut such is Lydia's caprice that to undeceive were probably to lose her I'll see whether she knows me  Walks aside and seems engaged in looking at the pictures  Enter  Lydia  Lyd  What a scene am I now to go thro' surely nothing can be more dreadful than to be obliged to listen to the loathsome addresses of a stranger to one's heartI have heard of girls persecuted as I am who have appealed in behalf of their favoured lover to the generosity of his rival suppose I were to try itthere stands the hated rivalan officer

convinced of it  Lyd  Ha ha ha I can't forbear laughing to think how her sagacity is overreached  Abs  But we trifle with our precious moments such another opportunity may not occurthen let me now conjure my kind my condescending angel to fix the time when I may rescue her from undeserved persecution and with a licensed warmth plead for my reward  Lyd  Will you then Beverley consent to forfeit that portion of my paltry wealththat burthen on the wings of love  Abs  O come to merich only thusin lovelinessBring no portion to me but thy love'twill be generous in you Lydiafor well you know it is the only dower your poor Beverley can repay  Lyd  How persuasive are his wordshow charming will poverty be with him  Abs  Ah my soul what a life will we then live Love shall be our idol and support we will worship him with a monastic strictness abjuring all worldly toys to center every thought and action thereProud of calamity we will enjoy the wreck of wealth while the surrounding gloom of adversity shall make the flame of our pure love show doubly brightBy Heav'ns I would fling all goods of fortune from me with a prodigal hand to enjoy the scene where I might clasp my Lydia to my bosom and say the world affords no smile to mebut here  Embracing her  If she holds out now the devil is in it  Aside  Lyd  Now could I fly with him to the Antipodes but my persecution is not yet come to a crisis  Enter Mrs  Malaprop  listening  Mrs Mal  I'm impatient to know how the little huzzy deports herself  Aside  Abs  So pensive Lydiais then your warmth abated  Mrs Mal  Warmth abated  soshe has

Sir AnthonyO fie Captain  Exeunt severally  SCENE IV  The NorthParade  Enter  Sir Lucius O'Trigger  Sir Luc  I wonder where this Capt Absolute hides himselfUpon my consciencethese officers are always in one's way in loveaffairsI remember I might have married Lady Dorothy Carmine if it had not been for a little rogue of a Major who ran away with her before she could get a sight of meAnd I wonder too what it is the ladies can see in them to be so fond of themunless it be a touch of the old serpent in 'em that makes the little creatures be caught like vipers with a bit of red clothHahisn't this the Captain coming faith it isThere is a probability of succeeding about that fellow that is mighty provoking Who the devil is he talking to  Steps aside  Enter  Capt Absolute  Abs  To what fine purpose I have been plotting a noble reward for all my schemes upon my soula little gypseyI did not think her romance could have made her so dn'd absurd eitherS'death I never was in a worse humour in my lifeI could cut my own throat or any other person's with the greatest pleasure in the world  Sir Luc  O faith I'm in the luck of itI never could have found him in a sweeter temper for  my purposeto be sure I'm just come in the nick now to enter into conversation with him and so quarrel genteelly Sir Lucius  goes up to  Absolute With regard to that matter Captain I must beg leave to differ in opinion with you  Abs  Upon my word then you must be a very subtle disputantbecause Sir I happen'd just then to be giving no opinion at all  Sir Luc  That's no reasonFor give me leave to tell you a man may  think  an untruth as well as  speak  one  Abs  Very true Sir but if the man never utters his thoughts I should think they  might  stand a  chance  of escaping controversy  Sir Luc  Then Sir you differ in opinion with me which amounts to the same thing  Abs  Hark'ee Sir Luciusif I had not before known you to be a gentleman upon my soul I should not have discovered it at this interview for what you can drive at unless you mean to quarrel with me I cannot conceive  Sir Luc  I humbly thank you Sir for the quickness of your apprehension  Bowing  you have nam'd the very thing I would be at  Abs  Very well SirI shall certainly not baulk your inclinationsbut I should be glad you would please to explain your motives  Sir Luc  Pray Sir be easythe quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it standswe should only spoil it by trying to explain itHowever your memory is very shortor you could not have forgot an affront you pass'd on me within this weekSo no more but name your time and place  Abs  Well Sir since you are so bent on it the sooner the betterlet it be this eveninghere by the SpringGardensWe shall scarcely be interrupted  Sir Luc  Faith that same interruption in affairs of this nature shews very great illbreeding I don't know what's the reason but in England if a thing of this kind gets wind people make such a pother that a gentleman can never fight in peace and quietnessHowever if it's the same to you Captain I should take it as a particular kindness if you'd let us meet in King'sMeadFields as a little business will call me there about six o'clock and I may dispatch both matters at once  Abs  'Tis the same to me exactlyA little after six then we will discuss this matter more seriously  Sir Luc  If you please Sir there will be very pretty smallsword light tho' it won't do for a long shotSo that matter's settled and my mind's at ease    Exit  Sir Lucius  Enter  Faulkland  meeting  Absolute  Abs  Well metI was going to look for you O Faulkand all the Daemons of spite and disappointment have conspired against me I'm so vex'd that if I had not the prospect of a resource in being knock'd o'the head by and bye I should scarce have spirits to tell you the cause  Faulk  What can you meanHas Lydia chang'd her mindI should have thought her duty and inclination would now have pointed to the same object  Abs  Aye just as the eyes do of a person who squintswhen her  loveeye  was fix'd on  me  t'otherher  eye  of  duty  was finely obliquedbut when duty bid her point  that  the same wayoff t'other turn'd on a swivel and secured its retreat with a frown  Faulk  But what's the resource you  Abs  O to wind up the whole a good natured Irishman here has  mimicking  Sir Lucius beg'd  leave to have the pleasure of cutting my throat and I mean to indulge himthat's all  Faulk  Prithee be serious  Abs  'Tis fact upon my soulSir Lucius O'Triggeryou know him by sightfor some affront which I am sure I never intended has obliged me to meet him this evening at six o'clock 'tis on that account I wish'd to see youyou must go with me  Faulk  Nay there must be some mistake sure Sir Lucius shall explain himselfand I dare say matters may be accommodatedbut this evening did you sayI wish it had been any other time  Abs  Whythere will be light enough there will as Sir Lucius says "be very pretty smallsword light tho' it won't do for a long shot"Confound his long shots  Faulk  But I am myself a good deal ruffled by a difference I have had with Juliamy vile tormenting temper has made me treat her so cruelly that I shall not be myself till we are reconciled  Abs  By Heav'ns Faulkland you don't deserve her  Enter Servant gives  Faulkland  a letter  Faulk  O Jack this is from JuliaI dread to open itI fear it may be to take a last leave perhaps to bid me return her lettersand restore O how I suffer for my folly  Abs  Herelet me see  Takes the letter and opens it  Aye a final sentence indeed'tis all over with you faith  Faulk  Nay Jackdon't keep me in suspence  Abs  Hear then  As  I am convinced that my dear  Faulkland  's own reflections have already upbraided  braided him for his last unkindness to me I will not add a word on the subjectI wish to speak with you as soon as possible  Your's ever and truly  Julia    There's stubbornness and resentment for you  Gives him the letter  Why man you don't seem one whit the happier at this  Faulk  O yes I ambutbut  Abs  Confound your  buts  You never hear any thing that would make another man bless himself but you immediately dn it with a  but  Faulk  Now Jack as you are my friend own honestlydon't you think there is something forward something indelicate in this haste to forgive Women should never sue for reconciliation  that  should  always  come from us  They  should retain their coldness till  woo'd  to kindness and their  pardon  like their  love  should  not unsought be won  Abs  I have not patience to listen to you thou'rt incorrigibleso say no more on the subject I must go to settle a few matterslet me see you before sixrememberat my lodgings A poor industrious devil like me who have toil'd and drudg'd and plotted to gain my ends and am at last disappointed by other people's follymay in pity be allowed to swear and grumble a little but a captious sceptic in lovea slave to fretfulness and whimwho has no difficulties but of  his own  creatingis a subject more fit for ridicule than compassion    Exit  Absolute  Faulk  I feel his reproachesyet I would not change this too exquisite nicety for the gross content with which  he  tramples on the thorns of love His engaging me in this duel has started an idea in my head which I will instantly pursue I'll use it as the touchstone of Julia's sincerity and  disinterestednessif her love prove pure and sterling oremy name will rest on it with honour and once I've stamp'd it there I lay aside my doubts for everbut if the dross of selfishness the allay of pride predominate'twill be best to leave her as a toy for some less cautious Fool to sigh for    Exit  Faulkland  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  Julia's  DressingRoom  Julia  sola  How this message has alarmed me what dreadful accident can he mean why such charge to be aloneO Faulklandhow many unhappy momentshow many tears have you cost me  Enter  Faulkland  muffled up in a Ridingcoat  Jul  What means thiswhy this caution Faulkland  Faulk  Alas Julia I am come to take a long farewell  Jul  Heav'ns what do you mean  Faulk  You see before you a wretch whose life is forfeitedNay start notthe infirmity of my temper has drawn all this misery on meI left you fretful and passionatean untoward accident drew me into a quarrelthe event is that I must fly this kingdom instantlyO Julia had I been so fortunate as to have call'd you mine intirely before this mischance had fallen on me I should not so deeply dread my banishmentBut no more of thatyour heart and promise were given to one happy in friends character and station they are not bound to wait upon a solitary guilty exile  Jul  My soul is oppress'd with sorrow at the  nature  of your misfortune had these adverse circumstances arisen from a less fatal cause I should have felt strong comfort in the thought that I could  now  chase from your bosom every doubt of the warm sincerity of my loveMy heart has long known no other guardianI now entrust my person to your honourwe will fly togetherWhen safe from pursuit my Father's will may be fulfilled and I receive a legal claim to be the partner of your sorrows and tenderest comforter Then on the bosom of your wedded Julia you may lull your keen regret to slumbering while virtuous love with a Cherub's hand shall smooth the brow of upbraiding thought and pluck the thorn from compunction  Faulk  O Julia I am bankrupt in gratitude but the time is so pressing it calls on you for so hasty a resolutionWould you not wish some hours to weigh the advantages you forego and what little compensation poor Faulkland can make you beside his solitary love  Jul  I ask not a momentNo Faulkland I have lov'd you for yourself and if I now more than ever prize the solemn engagement which so long has pledged us to each other it is because it leaves no room for hard aspersions on my fame and puts the seal of duty to an act of loveBut let us not lingerPerhaps this delay  Faulk  'Twill be better I should not venture out again till darkYet am I griev'd to think what numberless distresses will press heavy on your gentle disposition  Jul  Perhaps your fortune may be forfeited by this unhappy actI know not whether 'tis so but sure that alone can never make us unhappy The little I have will be sufficient to  support  us and  exile  never should be splendid  Faulk  Aye but in such an abject state of life my wounded pride perhaps may increase the natural fretfulness of my temper till I become a rude morose companion beyond your patience to endure Perhaps the recollection of a deed my conscience cannot justify may haunt me in such gloomy and unsocial fits that I shall hate the tenderness that would relieve me break from your arms and quarrel with your fondness  Jul  If your thoughts should assume so unhappy a bent you will the more want some mild and affectionate spirit to watch over and console you One who by bearing  your  infirmities with gentleness and resignation may teach you  so  to bear the evils of your fortune  Faulk  O Julia I have proved you to the quick and with this useless device I throw away all my doubts How shall I plead to be forgiven this last unworthy effect of my restless unsatisfied disposition  Jul  Has no such disaster happened as you related  Faulk  I am ashamed to own that it was all pretended yet in pity Julia do not kill me with resenting a fault which never can be repeated But sealing this once my pardon let me tomorrow in the face of Heaven receive my future guide and monitress and expiate my past folly by years of tender adoration  Jul  Hold Faulklandthat you are free from a crime which I before fear'd to name Heaven knows how sincerely I rejoiceThese are tears of thankfulness for that But that your cruel doubts should have urged you to an imposition that has wrung my heart gives me now a pang more keen than I can express  Faulk  By Heav'ns Julia  Jul  Yet hear meMy Father lov'd you Faulkland and you preserv'd the life that tender parent gave me in his presence I pledged my hand  joyfully  pledged itwhere before I had given my heart When soon after I lost that parent it seem'd to me that Providence had in Faulkland shewn me whither to transfer without a pause my grateful duty as well as my affection Hence I have been content to bear from you what pride and delicacy would have forbid me from anotherI will not upbraid you by repeating how you have trifled with my sincerity  Faulk  I confess it all yet hear  Jul  After such a year of trialI might have flattered myself that I should not have been insulted with a new probation of my sincerity as cruel as unnecessary A trick of such a nature as to shew me plainly that when I thought you lov'd me best you even then regarded me as a mean dissembler an artful prudent hypocrite  Faulk  Never never  Jul  I now see it is not in your nature to be content or confident in love With this conviction I never will be yours While I had hopes that my persevering attention and unreproaching kindness might in time reform your temper I should have been happy to have gain'd a dearer influence over you but I will not furnish you with a licensed power to keep alive an incorrigible fault at the expence of one who never would contend with you  Faulk  Nay but Julia by my soul and honour if after this  Jul  But one word moreAs my faith has once been given to you I never will barter it with another I shall pray for your happiness with the truest sincerity and the dearest blessing I can ask of  Heaven to send you will be to charm you from that unhappy temper which alone has prevented the performance of our solemn engagementAll I request of  you  is that you will yourself reflect upon this infirmity and when you number up the many true delights it has deprived you oflet it not be your  least  regret that it lost you the love of one who would have follow'd you in beggary through the world  Exit  Faulk  She's gonefor everThere was an awful resolution in her manner that rivetted me to my placeO FoolDoltBarbarian Curst as I am with more imperfections than my fellowwretches kind Fortune sent a heavengifted cherub to my aid and like a ruffian I have driven her from my sideI must now haste to my appointmentWell my mind is tuned for such a sceneI shall wish only to become a principal in it and reverse the tale my cursed folly put me upon forging

cryingI'll  be hanged if that Faulkland has not been tormenting you  Jul  You mistake the cause of my uneasiness Something  has  flurried me a littleNothing that you can guess atI would not accuse Faulkland to a Sister  Aside  Lyd  Ah whatever vexations you may have I can assure you mine surpass themYou know who Beverley proves to be  Jul  I will now own to you Lydia that Mr Faulkland had before inform'd me of the whole affair Had young Absolute been the person you took him for I should not have accepted your confidence on the subject without a serious endeavour to counteract your caprice  Lyd  So then I see I have been deceived by every onebut I don't careI'll never have him  Jul  Nay Lydia  Lyd  Why is it not provoking when I thought we were coming to the prettiest distress imaginable to find myself made a mere Smithfield bargain of at lastThere had I projected one of the most sentimental elopementsso becoming a disguiseso amiable a ladder of RopesConscious Moonfour horsesScotch parsonwith such surprise to Mrs Malapropand such paragraphs in the NewspapersO I shall die with disappointment  Jul  I don't wonder at it  Lyd  Nowsad reversewhat have I to expect but after a deal of flimsy preparation with a bishop's licence and my Aunt's blessing to go simpering up to the Altar or perhaps be cried three times in a countrychurch and have an unmannerly fat clerk ask the consent of every butcher in the parish to join John Absolute and Lydia Languish  Spinster  O that I should live to hear myself called Spinster  Jul  Melancholy indeed  Lyd  How mortifying to remember the dear delicious shifts I used to be put to to gain half a minute's conversation with this fellowHow often have I stole forth in the coldest night in January and found him in the garden stuck like a dripping statueThere would he kneel to me in the snow and sneeze and cough so pathetically he shivering with cold and I with apprehension and while the freezing blast numb'd our joints how warmly would he press me to pity his flame and glow with mutual ardourAh Julia that was something like being in love  Jul  If I were in spirits Lydia I should chide you only by laughing heartily at you but it suits more the situation of my mind at present earnestly to entreat you not to let a man who loves you with sincerity suffer that unhappiness from your  caprice  which I know too well caprice can inflict  Lyd  O Lud what has brought my Aunt here  Enter  Mrs Malaprop Fag  and  David  Mrs Mal  So so here's fine workhere's fine suicide paracide and salivation going on in the fields

Sir will you inform us    To  Fag  Fag  Ma'am I should hold myself very deficient in every requisite that forms the man of breeding if I delay'd a moment to give all the information in my power to a lady so deeply interested in the affair as you are  Lyd  But quick quick Sir  Fag  True Ma'am as you say one should be quick in divulging matters of this nature for should we be tedious perhaps while we are flourishing on the subject two or three lives may be lost  Lyd  O patienceDo Ma'am for Heaven's sake tell us what is the matter  Mrs Mal  Why murder's the matter slaughter's the matter killing's the matterbut he can tell you the perpendiculars  Lyd  Then prythee Sir be brief  Why then Ma'amas to murderI can  ake upon me to sayand as to slaughter or manslaughter that will be as the

trifling  Lyd  'Tis true Sir and your reproof bids me offer this gentleman my hand and solicit the return of his affections  Abs  O my little angel say you soSir Lucius I perceive there must be some mistake here with regard to the affront which you affirm I have given youI can only say that it could not have been intentionalAnd as you must be convinced  that I should not fear to support a real injury you shall now see that I am not ashamed to atone for an inadvertencyI ask your pardon But for this lady while honour'd with her approbation I will support my claim against any man whatever  Sir Anth  Well said Jack and I'll stand by you my Boy  Acres  Mind I give up all my claimI make no pretensions to any thing in the worldand if I can't get a wife without fighting for her by my Valour I'll

foundation however for the tale he told meO woman how true should be your judgment when your resolution is so weak  Faulk  Juliahow can I sue for what I so little deserve I dare not presumeyet Hope is the child of Penitence  Jul  Oh Faulkland you have not been more faulty in your unkind treatment of me than I am now in wanting inclination to resent it As my heart honestly bids me place my weakness to the account of love I should be ungenerous not to admit the same plea for your's  Faulk  Now I shall be blest indeed  Sir Anthony  comes forward    Sir Anth  What's going on hereSo you have been quarrelling too I warrantCome Julia I never interfered before but let me have a hand in the matter at lastAll the faults I have ever seen in my friend Faulkland seemed to proceed from what he calls the  delicacy  and  warmth  of his affection for youThere marry him directly Julia you'll find he'll mend surprisingly  The rest come forward  Sir Luc  Come now I hope there is no dissatisfied person

Sir Anth  Gad Sir I like your spirit and at night we single lads will drink a health to the young couples and a husband to Mrs Malaprop  Faulk  Our partners are stolen from us Jack I hope to be congratulated by each otheryours for having checked in time the errors of an illdirected Imagination which might have betray'd an innocent heart and mine for having by her gentleness and candour reformed the unhappy temper of one who by it made wretched whom he loved most and tortured the heart he ought to have ador'd  Abs  Well Jack we have both tasted the Bitters as well as the Sweets of Lovewith this difference only that  you  always prepared the bitter cup for yourself while  I    Lyd  Was always obliged to  me  for it hey Mr ModestyBut come no more of that our happiness is now as unallay'd as general  Jul  Then let us study to preserve it so and while Hope pictures to us a flattering scene of future Bliss let us deny its pencil those colours which are too bright to be lastingWhen Hearts deserving Happiness would unite their fortune Virtue would crown them with an unfading garland of modest hurtless flowers but illjudging Passion will force the gaudier Rose into the wreath whose thorn offends them when its Leaves are dropt
