 MEMOIRS OF THE Court of  France  AND City of  Paris  CONTAINING The Intrigues of that  Court  and the Characters of the  Ministers of State  and other  Officers  Together With the Occurrences of the TOWN  In Two PARTS  Translated from the French  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  at  GraysInnGate  and  George Strahan  at the  Golden Ball  in  Cornhil  MDCCII  MEMOIRS Of the COURT of FRANCE And of the CITY of PARIS  PART I  IT was soon after the Treaty with the Duke of  Savoy  that I came to the  French  Court The King found it convenient to conclude a Peace with that Prince thereby to ease himself of so expensive and troublesome a War as that had prov'd which he had been obliged to maintain on that side This great Monarch who having once put an end to the Civil Wars which were rais'd in his Kingdom while he was under age had been so successful in his Undertakings that he was look'd on as a Prince whom Providence design'd to raise above all others found himself on a sudden in danger of being cast down from his greatest height of Grandeur all  Europe  being united against him and King  William  who is now in Possession of the  Throne of  England  having been invited thither by some of that Kingdom to deliver them from the Apprehensions they were under that their Religion Laws and Privileges were in danger from the Measures taken by King  James  and his Ministers engaged so many Princes in his Interests by his prudent Conduct that in a short time he form'd a very considerable League and put himself at the Head of so many Forces that he was in a Condition to put a stop to his most Christian Majesty's formidable Power under which every thing had bowed before So that by a Vi  issitude frequent enough in Governments one descended of  William  of  Nassaw  preserv'd the House of  Austria  from its utter Ruin The beginnings of which were owing to his illustrious Predecessor Yet nothing in all this War created more trouble to the King than the Duke of  Savoy  's declaring against him He had often endeavour'd to take him off from the Confederates but could not prevail The Mareshal  de Catinat  who commanded his Majesty's Army in  Italy  and who is as well qualify'd for Negociations of State as for the Business of War was more successful than others had been He sent the Count  de Tesse  Lieutenant General of the King's Armies to  Turin  with Instructions suitable to those he had himself received from Court and that he might be the better heard his Majesty added so many Troops to his Army under the Mareshal's Command that he made it much Superiour to the Duke of  Savoy's  He had two Reasons for doing this one was that thereby he might make the Duke sensible of the Mischiefs he was capable of doing him and the other was that he might not be afraid of the foreign Troops which he had call'd to his Assistance who might have offer'd to prescribe to him if they had been equal to the united Forces of  France  and  Savoy  The advantageous Proposals that were offer'd to the Duke made him hearken to an Accommodation By one of the Articles of this Treaty  the Princess of  Savoy  was to be given in Marriage to the Duke of  Burgundy  so soon as she was full twelve years of Age Until which time she was to be educated in  France  for as yet she wanted fifteen or sixteen months of it And the King engaged to give two Dukes and Peers of  France  to remain Hostages in  Savoy  till the Marriage should be accomplish'd The King made choice of the Dukes  de Froix  and  de Choiseul  to go there as the two Hostages and gave each of them Livers to defray the expence of their Journey The Dutchess  du Lude  was appointed Lady of Honour to this Princess The Dutchess  d' Arpajou  expected to have had the Honour of this Charge because she had it under the Dauphiness And she was so vexed at the Disappointment that in a short time she fell into an Apoplexy which oblig'd her to go to the Waters of  Bourbon  though the Season in which they are usually taken was already past but it's now believ'd they are good for that Disease at any time of the year and therefore no regard is had to any particular Season The King appointed also six  Dames du palais  one of which was the Countess  de Roucy  who is this Dutchess's Daughter upon which account it was thought that the King's having neglected her self would not affect her any more But as we always prefer our own Interests to that of others she was much more sensible of the Affront which she thought was put upon her self than of the Honour which was done to her Daughter It's but of late that the Dutchess  du Lude  could reasonably hope to have been so fortunate for she was not much in Favour at Court nor of the number of those Ladies who are allow'd to go to  Marli  and the first time she went there it cost her Crowns to the Princess  d' Harcourt  who makes money of every thing and who procur'd her that Favour She had some Difficulty to furnish the Money yet she has reason to be wellpleas'd that she employ'd it that way for she has thereby had  Opportunities to act her part so well that she is got much into the King's Favour and into the Favour of those in whom he has the greatest Confidence After she was nam'd to her Charge she took Journey very soon for  PoutBeauvoisin  which separates  France  from the Dominions of  Savoy  at which Place she was to receive the Princess of  Savoy  The Countess  de Roucy  went thither also with the other five  Dames du palais  whom the King had named The Marquiss  de Dangeau  who had better Fortune than the Dutchess  d' Arpajou  for he was nam'd Gentleman of Honour to the young Princess which was the very Charge he had with the late Dauphiness went also to meet her with the other Officers of her Houshold whom the King had nam'd The Count  de Tesse  who was made her first Master of Horse as a Reward of the good Services he had done at the Treaty would have much rather chosen to have been Gentleman of Honour The King had some time before granted the Marquiss  de Dangeau  the great Privilege of the Order of St  Lazarus  which the Count  de Tesse  thought was a sufficient Reward and that nothing more was design'd for him but he soon found his mistake Yet he has no reason to complain of his own Fortune for he is one of those whom the Court has us'd with the greatest Kindness yea I may add that he is even overburthen'd with its Favours for in a short space of time he was made Governour of  Ypres  Knight of the Holy Ghost Collonel General of the Dragoons Lieutenant General of the King's Armies and first Gentleman of the Horse to the Dutchess of  Burgundy  This might seem strange but that we often see when a Courtier has once got much into Favour the King is so lavish in bestowing Honours and Preferments upon him that one would think he was to keep none in reserve for others  Some days after this the Princess of  Savoy  took her Journey from  Turin  for  PontBeauvoisin  where  her Lady of Honour waited for her with the King's Coaches They whom the Duke of  Savoy  sent along with her to be her Convoy took leave of her at that Place And when she had come as far as  Lions  the Dutchess  du Lude  made her stay a while there as well to refresh her after the Fatigue of her Journey as to satisfie the Curiosity of the People who were passionately desirous to see her after which she set forward in her Journey for  Fountainbleau  where the Court was at that time The King went as far as  Montargis  to meet her for he knew what day she was to be there the Dauphin went along with his Majesty as did also the Duke and Dutchess of  Orleans  and having lodg'd there that night they came to  Nemours  next day to dinner where the Duke of  Burgundy  waited for them They were then within four Leagues of  Fountainbleau  which they easily reach'd before night The Princess was then but a very Child yet the King was so taken with her that he stay'd full four hours in Company with her at  Montargis  The Duke and Dutchess of  Savoy  had taught her so well her Lesson that she seem'd to have Wit and Sense much above her Age The Court began now to consider what Name or Title should be given her whether they should call her Dutchess of  Burgundy  or Princess of  Savoy  the King inclined to the first though she was not to be married for some considerable time His reason was that that Title would give her the Precedency of all the Princesses of the Blood without giving them any reason to complain But the Duke of  Savoy  requested the King that she might retain her own Title till she was married to the Duke of  Burgundy  He thought perhaps thereby to find a Precedent for him and his Family henceforth to claim Precedency at the  French  Court for he knew well enough that whatever Title they gave her she should always take the door of all the Ladies about the Court And it seems he knew that when one of his Ancestors was in  France  in the time of  Henry  IV and disputed for Place with  Henry de Bourbon  Prince of  Conde  at the door of the King's Antichamber the King took the Prince by the Hand and made him enter first and to mortifie the Duke of  Savoy  yet farther he told him that he knew not what he meant in offering to vie with a Prince who might one day be his Master  However the present Duke of  Savoy  having requested the King that his Daughter's Title might be continued till the Marriage the King held a Council with his Ministers that he might know what was fittest to be done on that Occasion They fell upon a middleway which was to call her neither Duthess of  Burgundy  nor Princess of  Savoy  but only  the Princess  without adding any more and thus she was always called till the day of her Marriage In the mean time it was ordered that she should have the Precedency of all the Princesses of the Blood as being the presumptive Wife of the Duke of  Burgundy  The King caus'd her to be entertain'd with Diversions suitable to her Age And Monsieur  L' abbee de Choisi  finding it was become fashionable to be employ'd in something relating to the young Princess thought that he should make his Court wonderfully well by writing a Narrative of every thing that had befallen her since she parted from  Tarin  When this Book came first abroad some People got into an Humour of commending it highly in all Companies as the finest Piece that had appear'd of a long time But if they had been ask'd what they found in it that made them boast so much of it they had been puzled to tell what it was The more ingenuous and frank sort of People spake quite otherwise of it and instead of calling it so fine a Piece they own'd plainly that it was good for nothing Monsieur  L' abbee  who sets up for an ingenious Writer was extremely vex'd at this but all those who are look'd upon as the best Judges agreeing in the same Opinion his Book was by common  consent condemn'd for waste Paper to be sent to the Grocers Shops  Before I proceed farther I beg leave to make a short Digression concerning this Author he lost once fifty  Lowis d' ors  at Game with that handsom Lady Madam  Fresnoi  and having no ready Money she trusted him for some time but at last sent to ask it of him he sent her instead of her Money a Copy of some Books he had written telling her at the same time that if she long'd for the Money because without it she had not wherewith to divert her self at Game as she had told him in her Note to him she might divert her self with those Books till such time as he could satisfie her with Money The Lady look'd upon this as a new way of paying Debts but it tempted her to write Books as well as others that by her own Compositions she might satisfie her Creditors when they ask'd Money of her  But to return to my Subject The Duke of  Savoy  was not at all well pleas'd that his Daughter had only the Title  of Princess  without having that of  Savoy  added to it But if he could not have his Ambition satisfy'd in this matter he try'd to have it in another He caus'd a  Latin  Inscription to be set up importing that after he had enlarged the Bounds of his Dominions and recover'd the Keys of  Italy  he had shut up the Temple of  Janus  It cannot be said that there was any manifest Falshood in this Inscription yet it was somewhat odd that he should boast of such mighty Wonders and in so strange a manner too For it was never heard before that the losing of Battels and a whole Province too was the way for a Prince to enlarge his Dominions or to reduce his Enemy to Reason The Inscription was put above a triumphal Arch which was erected at  Tarin  to set off a Firework that was raised there to testifie the Joy of that Place for the Peace And it was all he could boast of from the beginning of the War since he had lost not only his Dutchy but the Battels of  Staffard  and  Marsaille  into the bargain Yet the great Number of Enemies which  France  had at that time made his Majesty reckon that he should be a considerable Gainer though he should deliver up  Savoy  to him and even the Town and Citadel of  Pignerol  which were taken by Cardinal  Richeleu  in Person if by that Means he could oblige him to a Peace By this Treaty the Duke was  ut into as good Circumstances as if he himself had gain'd those Battels and conquer'd a great Province  The Duke having had the Pleasure to see two Dukes and Peers of  France  at his Court resolv'd to revenge himself and all the Princes of his Blood of the Affront which  Henry  IV put upon their Ancestor and as that great King had carrv'd it so high in his own House as to make a Prince of his own Blood take place of a Duke of  Savoy  So the present Duke would needs carry it so high at his Court as to make the Prince  de Carignan  who is of his Family and elder Brother to the Count  de Soissons  take place of the two  French  Dukes when they came to pay him a Visit at his House Had the King's great Master of Horse been there to see a Prince triumph over these two Dukes he had thought himself sufficiently reveng'd of them for they were so far from yielding him the place in his own House that they disputed it with him wheresoever they met him Perhaps he will not soon forget a Debate he had on this Score with the Duke  de Montausier  who having told him that he never thought nor was it ever heard that a younger Brother of the Family of  St Maur  would vie for Precedency with a Prince of a Sovereign House The Duke  de Montausier  answer'd him saucily that he would let him know that both as a younger Brother of the Family of  St Maur  and as Duke and Peer of  France  he would dispute the Precedency with him where ever they should meet But though perhaps this Duke may have been much in the right upon the one Score  yet certainly he was not so upon the other for a younger Brother of the Family of  St Maur  or of any other House can never be suppos'd equal to the Son of a Sovereign Prince And perhaps he had not spoke after that manner but that the Duke of  Lorrain  was at that time dispossed of his Dominions so that he look'd upon the Princes of that House but as younger Brothers of a good Family And it was no doubt for this very reason that much about the same time the Count  de Crequi Berniulle  enter'd into a Debate with the late Count  d' Harcourt  younger Brother to the Duke  d' Elbeuf  for he treated him just as if he had been his Equal and was so very haughty that when the Mareshals of  France  before whom both of them were oblig'd to appear to give account of their Quarrel made some Distinction between them and order'd him to go to the Prince's House and there to beg Pardon for what had pass'd his Behaviour to him was the same as before It's true he went to  Harcourt  where the Prince dwelt at that time but he caus'd drive his Coach to the very door of the Parlour where the Mareshals of  France  had appointed the Count  d' Harcourt  to receive him He found him there with some Gentlemen of their Neighbourhood for they themselves were near Neighbours The Prince had caused Chairs to be set for them and had also reserv'd one for the Count  de Crequi  while he himself design'd to sit in an Elbowchair But so soon as the Count  de Crequi  who was always of a great Presence of Mind perceiv'd that by this means he intended to let him understand the Difference between a Prince of a sovereign House and a Gentleman of a good Family he skilfully warded off the blow for after he had made those Compliments to the Prince which the Mareshals of  France  order'd him to do he went to the Chair that was reserv'd for him but instead of sitting down in it he put one knee upon the Seat of  it and took hold of the back of it with his Hands The Count  d' Harcourt  who had Orders prescrib'd him by the Mareshals of  France  how to behave himself on that Occasion as well as he and who was obliged not to sit while he was standing told him that it would be more for his Conveniency to sit down in the Chair and that at least the Gentlemen who were there present would take their Seats if he had once taken his The Count  d' Crequi  answer'd him that there was no need of Ceremonies among Neighbours as they were and that he might sit down if he pleas'd but as for himself he was well enough as he was With these words he ended his Visit and without giving the Prince time to make use of his Elbowchair took leave of him The Prince was obliged to wait on him to the door of the Parlour and the Distinction which he design'd to have made between them turn'd more to his Shame than to his Honour And he himself said plainly to one of the Gentlemen that was at his House and in whom he put Confidence that in his lifetime there was never any thing so mortified him as the Count  de Crequi  's Behaviour to him that day The Mortification no doubt was great enough but he met with one incomparably greater if he was sensible of it when the Prince of  Condee  cudgell'd him at  Luxenburg  This Treatment lets us see that every Man is Master in his own House and that there is a great Difference between a Prince of the Blood and any other Prince in  France  though of a Sovereign House However the Prince of  Conde  's great Haughtiness was brought low soon after I mean when he went out of  France  and betook himself to the Protection of the  Spaniards  and took part with them to the manifest Violation of that Allegiance which he ow'd his own Sovereign I admire that we have not a full Account of all this in the History that is written of his Life It is well enough known that so soon as he was at  Namur  he found Reason to repent  that ever he had left his native Country The Author of that History methinks should have told us all the Journeys he made from that Town to  Brussels  and from  Brussels  to  Namur  endeavouring to adjust the Difference about Precedency with the Archduke  Leopold  who pretended to take place of him He should have told us also all that happen'd in a Debate of the like nature between his most serene Highness and the Duke of  Lorrain  If it had been Cardinal  Mazarin  's good Pleasure to have made use of this Juncture to persuade the Prince of  Condee  to return he could have easily prevail'd for he was almost mad at the Treatment he met with But that Minister who thought it a piece of the best Policy he could contrive to oblige him to quit  France  was far from wishing his return thither These and a thousand other curious Things which are wholly left out deserv'd a place in the History of that Prince's Life and it would have been much more becoming an Historian to have publish'd them than to have entertain'd us with so many Trifles and false Stories  'Tis true the Author did not well know the History of that Prince's Life and he is so ingenuous as to tell us so much in the beginning of his Book but since he acknowledged that he was unable for such a Performance why did he undertake it There is nothing in my Opinion more inexcusable in an Author than to confess his own Ignorance for since he acknowledges his own Failings why does he venture to write Books A pretty Idea indeed he gives us of his Works Were it not a thousand times better he should say nothing of them And may he not reasonably expect the common Fate of all such Authors that is to make himself contemptible as they always do When an Author is so silly as to condemn himself he must not expect afterwards that others will deal more gently by him than he has done by himself  But to return to my Subject The Prince  de Carignan  having as I have just now said reveng'd his own Family and that of  Lorrain  of the Affronts that had been put upon them there were many Dukes and Peers of  France  who found their own Honour concern'd in the Treatment which the Dukes of  Froix  and  Choyseul  had met with and therefore they consulted together at private meetings if they should complain to his Majesty of these two Dukes for having disgrac'd their Character in bearing with a thing so unworthy of their Rank But the wisest of them did not think fit to do it for they thought it more than probable that before they went from  Versailles  they had Instructions given them in Writing how to behave themselves at  Turin  and therefore they could not hope for Redress though they should make their Complaint In the mean time the more Reasons the Duke of  Savoy  had to be well satisfied the more did he caress the two Dukes his very being an  Italian  makes him dissemble naturally The only thing he had to wish for to make him compleatly satisfy'd was that  Monsieur Louvois  had been still alive that he might have seen with what Art and Skill he could revenge himself of Injuries that were done him for as it was he who had first provok'd him to engage in a War against the King by the Slights he had given him upon many Occasions He would no doubt have been exceedingly pleas'd could he but have ask'd him what was now become of all that Haughtiness and Contempt with which he treated all the Sovereign Princes whose Power was inferiour to his Majesty's  This Prince having dealt after this manner by the two Hostages and having nothing else that could vex them thought it convenient to send them back to  France  without waiting till his Daughter's Marriage should be accomplish'd The pretence he used was that he had so much Confidence in his Majesty that he did not desire any other Security but his Word  He said also to the two Dukes that it was only for form sake that ever he had ask'd Hostages of the King and that he was now glad of the Opportunity he had to let all  Europe  see that he did not in the least doubt but that his Majesty would faithfully perform every thing he had promis'd that therefore they might return into  France  as soon as they pleas'd yet they would not adventure to do this till they should receive his Majesty's Orders  The King has also learn'd to dissemble not only from the Lessons that Cardinal  Mazarin  taught him but also by long Experience in Government and in the Exercise of a Sovereign Power which has taught him that the Art of dissembling is one of the most necessary Qualifications for a King He first assured the Duke of  Savoy  of his Thankfulness for his Generosity and then he order'd the two Dukes to return to  France  At the same time his Majesty sent an Ambassador into that Country it was the Count  de Briord  who belong'd to the Prince of  Condee  without whose Knowledge he had made an Interest for that Employment for which his Highness was highly offended at him but dar'd not shew his Resentments for fear of a Reprimand from the King  The Feast of Christmass was now at hand and the Dutchess  du Lude  caused a little  Jesus  to be made for a Present to the young Princess after the custom of  Italy  She found it upon her Toilet at her Levee and the Case into which it was put being of most exquisite and curious Work with panes of Chrystal she was altogether charmed with it But upon Newyears Day the King made her a much more magnificent Present for he gave her an Apron with Jewels to the value of an Hundred thousand Franks in it The Dauphin gave her another which had cost him Forty thousand Franks and these two Newyears Gifts were accompanied with a third Present from the King of all the Jewels that had ever belong'd to his own Queen and to the late Dauphiness The  Count  de Thoulouse  after the King's Example gave so magnificent Newyears Gifts that they seem'd too great by much for a private Person No doubt but what he did was by the King's Allowance and that even his Majesty advised him to it But whatever was in that it was to the Marquis  d' Antin  who is his Brother by the Mother's side that he made those rich Presents and the whole Business was manag'd thus The Marquiss  d' Antin  being gone to dine with his Brother in Law the Marquis  de Barbesieux  he found under his Mapkin a Billet which was folded he knew not what was the Import of it and the Marquis  de Barbesieux  who probably had put it there by his Majesty's Order having forbidden him to blus    is Lady should not know of it he told him also that all the Company would allow him to read it and that they would refer it to his own Discretion whether he would tell them what was in it or not for they would not at all vex him The Marquis  d' Antin  arose from the Table and went to the Window to read it He found that instead of coming from a Lady as he at first had imagin'd it was come from the Count  de Thoulouse  who took the Liberty to call him a big hoggish Fellow for he look'd like one that had got enough of Food in his time But he had no Reason to complain of this Freedom since as the Contents of the Billet made him see clearly that it proceeded from true Friendship For the Count told him that two years ago he had resolved to give him a Pension of Ten thousand Livres a year and that as it was but just he should have the Benefit of it from that time so now he gave him notice that he had not only settled it on him for the time coming but had also order'd his Treasurer immediately to pay him Livers for the two past years The Marquis  d' Antin  being come back to the Table told the Company that they were not much mistaken if they thought that this was a Billet  doux  that at least he himself took it for one  and he was sure he was in the right of it and for that he would appeal to the Judgment of those present He then told them the Contents of it and so soon as they had heard them they all own'd that it was incomparably better than any Billet that could come even from the handsomest Lady They had all the Reason in the World to think so since Livers a year and of ready Money is well worth any Mistress especially now adays when the World is so chang'd that whereas formerly the Men sought after the Ladies these do now seek after the Men and almost all of them are become effronted to the highest Degree and carry on their Debauchery so far that many of them fuddle as if they were to gain no small Honour and Reputation by it and since the Cordial Liquors came in Fashion they make use of that Pretence to drink of every thing that pleases their Pallate not excepting even Drandy it self which they drink as if it were sweet Water by which we may guess how well they relish other Liquors and seeing their Tast is so viciated that they love even that which Porters themselves detested not many years ago it is not very probable that they'll be at much Pains to resist those Temptations that procure those Pleasures which are much more natural than the other and which in the Opinion of some People are not altogether so unworthy of the Female Sex And the Truth is the Ladies are generally sensible enough of this and are become so impudent in those lewd Practices that one whom I know very well and who is none of the least considerable about the Court knowing some time ago that her Gallant was to be married besought him to call at her House as he return'd from Church It was the Niece of this  Messalina  whom he married and the Niece's Modesty is as great as the Aunts Impudence However her Gallant not being able to refuse her Desire was no sooner in her Chamber but she ask'd another Favour of  him which was that he would pass that day a bed with her that at night her Niece might have nothing but what she had left The Bridegroom stood in great need of Money and knowing that she rewarded liberally granted her Request while the Friends who were invited to the Marriage were searching throughout all the parts of the Neighbourhood to know what was become of him Yet this is not the only Court Lady of this Stamp But every one of them were lash'd and expos'd sufficiently in some Carols and Lampoons that were compos'd and publish'd soon after the Princess came to  France  There we had the true and genuine History of every one of them without the least Disguise 'Tis true it is not well done to discover to the World the Faults of other People yet the exposing of them thus was useful to persuade many of them to reflect upon their own Conduct and to be more circumspect in time coming But the worst thing of those Carols was that they were so full of gross Immoralities that many who had but a small share of Religion detested them The King who was never of an Humour to bear with things of that nature and less now than ever that he is become devout in good earnest made a deal of noise about them and said openly before all the Court that he had one good Counsel to give the Author of them which was that he would make his Escape in time thereby to prevent the Punishments which he must inevitably undergo if ever he come to be discover'd If the Author had follow'd this Counsel it had been the same thing as to have accus'd himself and therefore whoever he was he put as good a Face on it as they could do who were sensible of their own Innocence There is not the least doubt but that he belongs to the Court and that he is one of those who are best acquainted with it for no body else could know so well the History of every one's Life as that Author did though after all he was mistaken in some things However after  many had been suspected and among the rest a Lady of very great Quality because her Genius bends a little that way it came at last to be generally believed that the Chevalier de  Bouillon  was the man but because there was no certain Proof of it and that all that was said was founded only on suspicion he got no harm by it The King was not satisfied that he had signified his displeasure against this Author who had thus signalized himself for an impious Wretch and perhaps for a Lyar too for it is not probable that all the nasty things that are in those Carolls can be litterally true but his Majesty made it known also that he would not take it well if any body should sing them But as there are some things above the Power of Kings how great soever their Authority may be So this Order took not much effect every body sung them as before except that they were cautious not to do it in the hearing of those who they thought would give an Account of it to his Majesty For we must understand that there are abundance of spies about the Court and though some of them are known as the Marquis  de Termes  and some others yet there are of them who act their parts so cunningly that there is nothing they are less suspected of than of being what they truly are  It was not only in these Carolls and Songs that the Conduct of the Ladies was publickly censur'd a certain Person who is well known in the World for an Imployment of a quite other kind than what he is naturally fitted for resolv'd to censure them also in the same manner that he has for a long time censur'd all mankind As he sets up for a Jester and maker of Ballads he made some upon the Accou  rements which the Ladies now make use of that they may be ready for an Engagement he brought them forth in slippers and quilted Wastcoats ready to enter the Lifts and though he nam'd no body yet as they who censure others must not expect many thanks especially when vicious customs are laid so deep that it s next to impossible  to root them out so his performances were so unacceptable that as a Reward of his pains he was soon born down and oppressed with a World of Censures and Reproaches And that much after the same manner that he had reproached others that is by Ballads and Lampoons but with this difference that whereas in th  se which he had compos'd he had been so civil as not to name any body  et they dealt so rudely by him as to name him expresly and which was harder upon him that they might chastize him yet farther they sent Copies of their Lampoons to his three Best Friends the Cardinal  de Bouillon  the Duke  de Chawnes  and the Marchioness  de Louvois  whose houses he frequented daily and who could not easily be without him They were not well pleas'd that others should be so unjust as to calumniate him who had never calumniated any person because as they said he had not nam'd any in the Songs which he had made Yet they cannot say but that since the time that from being Master of Requests he had dwindl'd into a Poet of the  Pontneuf  he has fallen foul upon several Persons of Quality without being so circumspect and therefore he must not expect that all the World will be so favourable to him as was the Cardinal and his other Friends And as there was no great injustice in finding fault with what he had done as to the Ladies so many others as well as he were of opinion that they had even done best to have laid by their sl  ppers and Wastcoats The thrust he gave in being thus smartly pareed and return'd upon himself the poor Fellow was forc'd to shut himself up in his little Closet without daring to peep abroad for some days But as every man returns soon to his natural Temper and as the Ladies too did not fail to provoke him anew not to spare them as hitherto he had done we have since had a thousand Ballads of his making where he represents them prettily enough  If Lewdness was so ordinary at this time among the Women it was not much less so among the Men but especially they were taken with a very Frenzy and Madness for which they could make no Apology for besides the Vice of excessive drinking which many of them were addicted to rather thro' bad custom than by natural inclination they had got into an humour of preferring the Women Players of the Playhouse and the Opera to their own Wives though never so handsome and their Husbands were much to blame for it if they were not modest and circumspect And thus for the leavings of a great many other People they forsook their own Wives whom they might have enjoy'd all alone yea and provoked them too to become common For nothing more provokes a Wife to be unfaithful to her Husband than when he slights her and prefers other Women to her  The Lords of the greatest Quality were not more exempted from this vice than were others though they be more obliged than other People to give good Example for the higher and greater a Man's Station and Character is the more is his behaviour exposed to the view of the publick  There was one of them among the rest who fell in Love with a Woman of the Opera which very much vexed his Friends and Relations but there was one thing encouraged him in his amours and serv'd to harden him in his shameful and lewd Practices and that was that many of the most topping Ladies about the Court went a purpose to the Opera that they might see his Mistress and speak highly to her advantage for those who enter once into a vicious way of living can applaud Vice with as little remorse as others applaud Virtue Those who were concern'd in this Nobleman had perceiv'd sometime before that it was necessary to observe his conduct narrowly and therefore they put a wise and sober Man to attend him who might give them an account  of his Behaviour But as youth has an aversion to People of this sort and usually considers them as Pedagogues whom they cannot bear with so this young Lord endeavour'd so soon as he could to free himself of the bonds which his friends had put upon him All the young Gentlemen who made their court to him confirm'd him as much as they could in  His Resolution  and they call'd his Observer by the name of  Caius Garrulus  which sounded not unlike his own name and they added an Epithite to it which was somewhat suitable to his Employment This young Gallant's Father was extreamly concern'd when he knew that his Son was so fond of this Actress He spoke to him of it as a thing which would ruin his Reputation And at length he spoke to him not only as from himself but as from the King to whom he knew that he pay'd very much Deference And that his Counsels might make the greater impression upon his Son's mind he told him that they who were fond of that sort of People met often with sad misfortunes and that his Rank and Quality did not at all secure him against the treachery of a  Coquette  and that if he must have a Mistress he should at least look for one with whom he could live with greater safety than he could do with her Notwithstanding all the Deference he had for the King and the Duty he ow'd to his Father he made no other Answer but that he would do all that was in his power to satisfie both of them but that he found so strong an inclination for that Woman that he knew not if it was in his power to disengage himself altogether from her on a sudden He continued notwithstanding all this to visit her and having told her every word his Father had spoke to him they agreed that he should not pay her a visit for some days  Caius Garrulus  advertised the young Gallants Friends of the visit he had paid maugre all his Fathers Remonstrances to the contrary upon which account his Father spoke once more to him and told him that he must be  very incorrigible in that he had so soon forgot what he had said to him formerly and that being of so high a birth as he was he ought at least to have delay'd that visit for some days thereby to give some proof of his obedience He took him to task so seriously as that the young Beau might have been perswaded to reflect as seriously upon his own behaviour He could not deny but that he had paid her a visit but the answer he gave was that with all due regard to the Deference he ow'd him he thought that he had no just ground to reprove him That Civility and good Manners had obliged him to go and tell her that he was peremptorily discharg'd to have any more Correspondence with her and that having once had a kindness for her he could do no less for she might have been justly enrag'd against him had he cast her off without telling her why That in the mean time notwithstanding the great desire he had to give him full satisfaction in that matter yet he could not but own that at the last visit he had found her more charming than ever that it troubled him much when he reflected upon his own weakness but that all he could do in obedience to his Commands was to pray to God for Strength and Resolution to obey them His Father understood well enough the meaning of all this and conceiving no great hopes of him he left him being much out of humour at his answer It was two or three days before the Son paid another visit to his Mistress yet he sent Letters to her every hour and gave her notice that next day his Father was to give a splendid Ball and that she must not fail to be there but that she should come disguised in such and such a manner that he might know her by her Garb This Ball was the finest that had been seen of a long time and all the Court was present at it but this young Lord could not as yet see his Mistress there which put him out of humour at a Lady who would fain have had the same Interest in his affection that the Actress had and flattered her  self with hopes that if she was successful his Father and his other Friends would not find so much fault with it She began to rally him for being out of Humour that she might thereby find a way to bring about her own purposes but he was not at leisure to give her an answer for he saw his Mistress come into the Ball that very moment She was disguised in Man's dress and he went immediately and spoke to a young Princess who was often engag'd in the Dance that with the first opportunity she would please to take out the young Spark who was in such and such a dress pointing to his Mistress She promis'd to do it and was as good as her word  Caius Garrulus  who had always an eye upon him having observ'd that he look'd much to that side where the new Masker was and that immediately after he had spoken to that Princess he began to suspect what it was he had said to her yet he would let no body know his Jealousie till he should be fully assured that he was in the right And observing this new Masker very narrowly the more he viewed him the more was he perswaded that it was his Master's Mistress By this time there was one came and took out the young Princess to dance and immediately after she took out this new Masker which let  Caius Garrulus  clearly see that he was not mistaken for he knew so well by her dancing that it was she whom he suspected that tho' he had not had any other presumptions that alone was sufficient to confirm him in his suspicions This Masker who was truly the young Lord's Mistress after she had danced with the young Princess was so affronted as to take out her Gallants Lady to dance with her  Caius Garrulus  could bear no longer with her Impudence but went and told his Masters Father who it was that had taken out his daughter in Law to dance He had a good mind at first to have caus'd to throw her over the Window and so had the young Lords Mother But when they had reriected that that would make too much noise both  of them resolved to try calmer methods for breaking off this correspondence they caused to inform him that she was false to him and that others conversed familiarly with her and unless he would give up converse with her it was not safe for his own Lady to bed with him But though they endeavoured under hand to raise all the jealousies imaginable in his mind yet he would believe nothing After these endeavours his Father was affraid lest what he would have had his Son to believe should prove true in good earnest and therefore he appointed a Woman to attend his Sons Mistress and to observe her so narrowly that it should not be in her power to prove false to his Son  This young Lord was not the only Person who was fond of the Women of Opera and Playhouse contrary to the duty he ow'd both to himself and to his Lady there were many others who after his Example did the same thing and but too many who had done it before him  But among all those whose inconsiderateness is the most astonishing the  e is not one more inexcusable than a certain Duke who was old enough to have given greater Proofs of his prudence besides that he had married a young Princess of incomparable Beauty and who deserv'd beyond all comparison to have been more esteemed than all the Mistresses he could find among that sort of Women But no consideration would prevail with him against lewdness and he was not only unfaithful to her but left her for good and all and went to keep House with his new Mistress Before this happened his Father who was one of the greatest and richest Lords about the Court had carried his Son's Lady to his own Seat in the Countrey while her Husband was in the Army Her Mother who lov'd her most tenderly was loath to part with her and had much rather she had stay'd with her but could not  obtain it Yet her Daughter wrote to her soon after and besought her to imploy all her interest with the King that he would please to give orders that she should return for she was not at all safe with her Father in Law who had spoken to her of Amours notwithstanding her relation to him and that he had spoken so very earnestly that no time must be lost if she had any concern for her honour and the peace of her mind It is not certain if all this was literally true or if it was only concerted between the Mother and the Daughter to get her brought out of that Countrey where her Father in Law dwelt and of which she was wearied that she might live with her Mother who longed so much for her company Whatever was in this the Lady having spoke of it to his Majesty obtained an order to the Dukes Father to send his Daughter in Law back to  Paris  He was enraged against both of them for the affront which they had put upon him and therefore though he ought to have been the first who should have reproved his Son for conversing with his new Mistress which now began to appear yet he was at no great pains to disswade him from it he alledg'd they had served him a very Scurvy trick and he was glad to revenge himself by this connivance But if he thought this a good way to be revenged of them he had very soon reason to be satisfied with it for his Son became so passionately in love with this new  or rather he became such a very Fool as when he knew that she was big with Child he left his Wife and went and lived with her and his Father having given him no great yearly revenue when he married him though he himself had Livers a Year besides great Summs of Money in his Coffers and not one Farthing of Debt he found himself so  because of the two Families he had to provide for and the charges he had been at in the Camp that he resolved to do what People will scarcely believe of one of his quality that was to  live without Coach and without that great number of Pages and Lackeys that Men of his quality usually have about them and thus he reduced all his expences for the Winter time to a very small matter having only one Lackey for himself and another for his Mistress and these he put in gray Cloaths that when he took a Hackney to go abroad neither he nor they might be known The Women Servants wereas few in number as the Lackeys she had only a Chambermaid and a Nurse and this last serv'd with both hands that is she was Servant of the House and Nurse at the same time His Friends could bear no longer with his inconsiderateness and this disgraceful way of living they spoke to him of it as a thing that would stain his honour to such a degree that it would be impossible for him ever to retrieve it and that he might not be altogether confounded with shame as he ought to be for such Practises they told him that this Woman had certainly bewitched him that at least they had reason to think so since it was so unnatural a thing in him to part with the most lovely Princess in the World and to keep house with a beggarly Strumpet whose very Trade and Profession was enough to make any body disgust her though she was a Thousand times more charming in her Person than she seem'd to be All the Answer he made them was that they spoke so of her only because they did not know her But if they had conversed a little with her they would soon be of another mind in this they could not agree with him and having taken leave of him without being able to perswade him to alter his measures they were grieved that he continued so obstinately to disgrace himself  When they found this they caused to speak underhand to the Woman her self and threatn'd that they would have recourse to Royal Authority to have her shut up in a Convent or in some Prison if she would not even perswade the Duke to part with  her One in her condition could not be well pleased with such a proposal and it quite confounded her She knew that those threatnings were not groundless for she had known a Woman kept in Prison Seven or Eight Years because she had been Mistress to the Count  D'Harcourt  whom we have already spoken of And therefore being resolved to prevent so great a mischief she promised to do all that was in her power to satisfy them and she was as good as her word for that very day after she had on set purpose made a show of melancholy to the Duke she told him that she could not any longer converse with him as hitherto she had done because her conscience reproached her continually with her guilt and represented to her every moment that she only was the cause that he abandoned his Lady the Dutchess and that every body blamed her for it as no doubt she deserved to be insomuch that was there nothing but that one consideration she was obliged to tell him that he must resolve to break up with her since their converse was equally shameful and sinful to them both The Duke was surprised at a discourse which he so little expected but having still the more esteem of her upon this very account because the two things she made use of as a pretence for this divorce are agreeable to a Lover that is his own interest and the virtue of the Person he loves he did all he could to make her change her thoughts but the fears of a Prison made her deaf to all his reasons and to all his caresses she persisted in her resolution to give over all converse with him and knowing nothing could more prevail with him to cause him to reflect upon his past conduct than his own Lady's charming Beauty which was indeed incomparably above hers she told him that if she was as beautiful as his Lady and if his Lady had nothing more charming about her than she had she would not think it strange that he should forsake her and live with her but being obliged to confess that all the advantage  was upon his Ladies side she could not suffer any longer that he should be called a Man of so ill a taste as to choose the worse and to forsake the better He wou'd fain have perswaded her that only her modesty made her speak so of herself that if his thoughts were asked in that matter he would soon tell just the contrary that he was as capable as any other to judge of their Beauties having conversed so much with her But his Mistress finding how he answered her and that it was impossible to make him gainsay any thing of all this she betook herself to her first Argument that her Conscience would not allow her to converse any longer with him  The Duke considered all these discourses as the effect of some secret discontent that had put her into an ill humour and that he might bring her back to her ordinary Gaiety he offer'd her some Presents but she refus'd them generously and as the most disinteressed Person in the World In the mean time she gave notice to those who had threatned her that she was using her utmost endeavours to satisfie them but if they were desirous that she should succeed it was needful they should do something upon their parts They bestirred themselves immediately knowing that it is best to strike the Iron while it is hot and they came a purpose to wait on the Duke He would have resisted all the Batteries they could have raised against him had they been alone but his Mistress treating him with so much Indifference and like a Woman who was absolutely resolv'd to abandon her former Vices he told them that there needed no more Importunities for he was resolved to give them full satisfaction But if they would know the true reason why he resolv'd so it was because his Mistress had determin'd him in it she who alone had a more absolute Empire over him than it was possible for all of them to have when they were united together that he chearfully and frankly own'd so much to them hoping  that for their parts they would also acknowledge that she was a much worthier Person than he could express an evident Proof of which was that she was fully resolved to bid adieu to all sorts of Intrigues and Amours a thing very unusual for Women after they have once been accustomed to those Pleasures But for her he told them that he had so good an opinion of her he could be surety for her she should never return to them that at least he would comfort himself with those thoughts of her His Friends did not trouble themselves to dispute this matter with him nor were they such fools as to inform him how much they had frighted her with their threatnings they thought it enough that they had brought him to their own Terms and it was all one to them by what means soever it was done the only thing they desired was how to bring the matter to an happy Issue now that it was so well begun They went to his Ladies Parents and desired they might concurr with them in reconciling them together But the Dutchess's Mother who after she had once taken back her Daughter to her house could never resolve to part with her told them resolutely that she would never consent to it The Dukes Father gave them much the same Answer for he continued to be extreamly angry at what the young Princess had said of him But as Men ordinarily yield sooner to Reason than Women do he was at last prevail'd with but upon condition that when his Daughter in Law should be reconcil'd to her Husband she should not see her Mother any more This was to throw Oyl into the Flame and serv'd only to provoke the Ladies Indignation so that she withstood their Reconcilement more than ever The Prince her Husband was much wiser and more reasonable than she was He told her that by the Laws both of God and Man they were oblig'd to contribute their endeavours for reconciling Husband and Wife even though they  had but small hopes to succeed in it But that in this case she was much more oblig'd to it than others were because it was the Concern of her Son in law and her Daughter But for all this she continued obstinate and she had such an Ascendant over him that he us'd to do nothing but what she was pleas'd with it was at last found necessary to speak to the King of it  His Majesty was of the Fathers opinion and thought that in procuring such an Agreement they ought not to stand upon Punctilios and therefore order'd the Dutchess to follow her Husbands Advice  The Condition propos'd by her Son in law's Father that she should not see her Daughter was qualified and she was allow'd to see her sometimes but not above twice a Week lest the Dukes Father should take it amiss It went much against the Ladies Stomach that they should set bounds to the Kindness she had for her Daughter and therefore she propos'd that if she was not to see her Daughter but twice a Week then her Son in law's Father should not be allow'd to see her at all and much less that they should live in the same House They found out also a Medium for this which was that he might see her as often as his Son would allow him and they told the Lady that her Son in law was more concerned than she was that his Father should not see her Daughter if all was true that was said of him After all these things were concerted nothing remain'd but to know what the Duke would do with his Mistress and his Child and that he would pitch upon a day for being fully reconciled to his Dutchess As to the first he promis'd to allow them a Pension which perhaps he has not been over careful to perform yet I will not vouch this for a Truth but because he was then as passionately in love with her as ever I may presume he was prodigal enough of his Promises but perhaps he  has been as sparing in performing them for Lovers easily forget their Promises when they are not any more to see the Person to whom they are made As to the other matter he made no difficulty in it the day was appointed and there was a new Marriage solemniz'd Before he went to Bed with his Wife their Parents paid their Compliments to them as if they had been but a new married Couple And their other Friends after their example did the same in fine they were both together carried to the Opera and to other publick places that those who had heard of their Divorce might see that the greatest Follies do not last always  One would think that such an example as this might have had a good Influence upon those who werefallen into the same frensy that is upon those who made but small account of their Wives for the sake of these naughty Creatures but we have not hitherto seen any good that it hath done to a certain Duke who though he has not as yet parted with his Wife as the other did yet he lives not in much better Terms with her one of these unhappy Women of the Playhouse having by some means engaged his Affections has so bewitchd him that of a long time he has had no Converse with his Wife and vet she's very young and which is more she's a Lady of great Vertue which is so valuable an Accomplishment yea and so singular in this Age as to deserve that a Husband should esteem it much more than he does  'Tis true she is not so great a beauty as is an Aunt of her Husbands who yet has not been much more fortunate though she be a Lady of great Virtue as well as her Neice This Lady was married to a Person of Honour and a Man of as good Sen  e as was about the Court which is another reason why he should have used her well for the more a Man has of Honour and true Sense the more will he endeavour to acquit himself of his Duty But he was so desperately in Love with a young Lady who  is also of great vertue and is at this time Superiour of the Maids of St  Marie de Chaliot  that he could not open his eyes to see how happy he might have been in his own Wife And he did even much worse than did the two Dukes I last spoke of for he did not so much as bed with her the first Night of the Marriage And if we will believe the accounts we have at Court he suffered her to continue always a Maid though they liv'd a long time together and though there was never any publick breach between them His Father who was also a Man of good Sense and so far from approving his want of affection to this Lady that he was extreamly vexed at it when he perceived it and told him his thought of it very freely and finding the Arguments he made use of made him nothing the wiser Man he be thought himself of others and try'd if perhaps they would be of greater force He told him that laying aside the authority of a Father he would now only advise him as his true Friend and that all he had to say to him was that all the Court look'd upon his Wife as a very agreeable Lady and that among them who esteem'd her much she might perhaps find one whom she would think worthy of her Affection that the best means how to prevent that was for him to perform the duty of a Husband to her otherwise perhaps another might supply his place This advice was sound and wholsome but as this young Gentleman had shut his Eyes and would not take notice of his Lady's true worth so he stopt his Ears at his Father's Reasons and held on his course without ever troubling himself with the thoughts of his future destiny Yet the Horoscope which his Father had cast for him prov'd false for there was never a Lady at Court made her self be less talk'd of than she did However her Husband died and she kept for a second Husband that which is so much valued in a Bride She was reputed a Widow but was truly a Maid when she was married the second time  And as if she had been born under the strangest Planet that ever was 'Tis generally believed that this second Husband has not as yet made her change her condition He was one of the handsomest men in  France  yet altogether unfit for the Marriage Bed and therefore his first Wife did not care much to dwell with him though there was never any publick rupture between them and though she might have made a very good figure at Court too But she chose rather to leave him there alone and to revenge her self of her hard fate upon the Harts and other wild Beasts with whom she made War so long as she liv'd 'Tis true that when she was a dying she made a Will in his Favours which would seem to import quite other things than what I have been just now alledging for it's seld  m that a Wife will be so obliging to a Husband unless she have first receiv'd of his Favours But all Women are not of the same humour and it must be said to the advantage of this Lady that as to this matter she was less concern'd and much more modest than many others are Hunting was that which she took greatest Pleasure in and because her Husband treated her always very kindly save in that which most of other Women think the chief and essential part of a Husband's kindness It seems she made no great account of it And she had rather that her Husband should enjoy her estate than some of her Relations whom she did not much esteem She gave the trust of her Will to the Duke  De Lesdeguires  but he being surprised with a sudden Death when he was least thinking of it and when he had lived but to half the Age that by the course of Nature he might have done it created much trouble afterwards to her Husband Yet this was a seasonable relief to him and he had much need of it to repair the breaches he had made in his own estate in the time he had been at Court  As the Court is the place of the World where the greatest number of extraordinary things fall out  so about the same time that the terms of the Reconciliation which I spoke of were agreed to There was one thing happened that did not sound well for one of the principal Actors in it and it has made People have but an ill Opinion of a Man whom we now bring upon the Stage  We must know then that among other methods which the King had taken to raise Money for maintaining the War he had publish'd an Edict for the sale of some Governments within the h  art of the Kingdom and there was more need of Money for the purchase of them than either of Service or Merit There is a little Town nam'd  Rue  lying towards  Abbeville  in  Piccardy  and the late Duke  d' Elbeuf  was formerly Governour of it And his Son the present Duke  d' Elbeuf  finding that it would be very convenient for him that he had the Government of the same place resolv'd to purchase it There was one Monsieur  d' Augancourt  a Gentleman of that Country who was neither rich nor much taken notice of some Years ago but has now a good estate and lives in plenty because he belong'd to the late Marquis  de Louvois  and carry'd his  Portofolio  when that Minister went to do busine  s with the King This Gentleman I say design'd also to purchase it and so soon as he knew that the Duke  d' Elbeuf  had the same design he took an odd method to carry it against him a method which any other Man than he would have been afraid of but he was for bold Adventures that he might bring about his Designs and because he had not been altogether unsuccessful in another business wherein he was once like to have been quite ruin'd he hop'd he might succeed well enough in this especially seeing what Friends or Interests soever the Duke  d Elbeuf  could make he was still much less to be fear'd than was his former  Antagonist  the Marquis  de Barbesieux  Yea it was not only with him he had contended but with the whole Family of his Old Master the Marquis  de Louvois  whose Memory he endeavour'd to blacken I shall first give an Account of this Affair and then I shall return to his business with the Duke  d'Elbeufe  The Marquis  de Louvois  being dead this  d' Augincourt  who had the honour to be known to the King because he had so very often carry'd this Minister  's Portofolio  to the Door of his Majesties Closet having asked and obtained a secret audience told him that he thought it his Duty to advertise him of one thing which his Majesty knew nothing of before which was that his Majesty had always believed that all the projects which the late Marquis  de Louvois  had presented to him were of his own contrivance but it was far from being so and that that Minister had always had recourse to him when he had any thing to do of Consequence That it was he who had projected such and such things and that the Marquis  de Louvois  was never able of himself to do any thing to purpose that his undertakings at  Maintenon  were a sufficient proof of this that at that place he had committed a great many faults which he had never fallen into had he but followed his advice that he was ready to discover these faults and oversights to his Majesty who because of his great skill in Fortification would soon be convinced that what he said was true The King who is truly skilful in these things and perhaps much more so than many People believe of him finding that he offer'd to prove to a demonstration all the oversights which he charg'd his late Minister with gave him upon that Account a fuller hearing than otherways he would have done  D' Augincourt  having said whatever he thought fit for his own advantage and the King knowing that in some things he was in the right though in some also he was mistaken was so far from telling him that he did not approve of his ingratitude to his Master to whom he had been obliged of his Estate that though these were his Sentiments  yet on the contrary he told him that he would continue the Pension to him which he had given him upon the Marquis  D' Louvois  's recommendation  D' Augincourt  though he was in some measure pleased with the Kings bounty because the cont  nuing of the Pension was a Proof that his Majesty approved of what he had said yet he was not altogether satisfied for he had flattered himself with the hopes of a much greater reward and that his Majesty would make use of him in his secret affairs of which he pretended to have the Key and expecting that the King would bestow the late Marquis  D'Louvois  place upon him he continued as often as he could find occasion to speak all the ill of him he could think of 'Tis impo  ble for one to behave himself after this manner at Court but that a Minister shall have notice of it and the Marquis  D'Barbiseux  was soon advertised of it and he was struck to the very Heart with it especially when he knew that the King had granted him his Pension by which he understood that his Majesty believed many of the things which he had alledged against his Fathers Memory These thoughts galled him so much that he resolved to be revenged on him and meeting with him that very day as he was going to the Kings Appartments he was not Master enough of his Passions for at first sight he gave him very harsh Language as he well deserved but  D' Augincourt  who flattered himself that since the King had heard him so favourably he would certainly grant him the honour of his Protection answered him with as much insolence as if he had never been his Fathers domestick This insolent behaviour raised the Marquis  D'Barbiseux  's passion to such a height that he himself forgot the respect he owed to the place he was in he took him by the Cravate and would have certainly strangled him had not his Friends put him in mind that the King would be highly offended at what he was doing He yeilded  to their reasons and went immediately to the King and told him that he came to beg his pardon for something he had done in a sudden fit of passion that his Majesty knew how unaccountable  D' Augincourts  ingratitude was towards his Father tho' it was to him he owed all he had that he had met with him accidentally at the door of the Antichamber and not being able to command his passion he had offered some violence to him of which he humbly acknowledged himself guilty that tho' his passion lasted but a moment because he had reflected upon it yet he did not pretend to be excusable upon that account and therefore he would submit to all the punishments that his Majesty should order for him only he besought him to consider how natural it was for a Son to be sensibly t  ched with every thing that concerned his Fathers Honour The King having heard him calmly answered him that it was good for him that he had so soon reflected upon his fault and had put a stop to the course of his passion but that he had done better if he had reflected sooner upon it so as not to have committed it that yet he would pardon him upon the account of what a Son ow'd to his Father but upon condition always that he should never again fall into the like enormity The Marquis  De Barbiseux  acted like a wise man thus to prevent the other in addressing himself to the King for scarcely had he done it when  D' Augincourt  presented himself before his Majesty and demanded justice for the ill treatment he had met with from his Minister The King told him he should have it but that he would first examine how the matter went but seeing he had once promised to pardon the Marquis  D' Barbiseux  all the satisfaction  D' Augincourt  could ever obtain was that his Majesty told him he had given him such a reprimand as was proper and that he would be wiser in time coming he told him also that when one had been a menial Servant to a Man as he had been to the Marquis  D'Louvois  he ought to behave himself respectfully towards his Children  D'Augincourt  might have learned from this to have been wiser afterwards than to contend with one that was above him yet never thinking that the same accident might befall him if he fell again into the same Errour he no sooner formed the design of carrying the Government of  Rue  against the Duke  D'Elbeuf  but he gave in a memoir against him to the King which contained that this Prince had been several times guilty of extortioning the People within the bounds of his Government of  Piccardy  and  Artois  and that his Majesty might give credit to this he offered to prove it so soon as he was commanded to do it the King who knew that this Prince had some good qualities for which he is deservedly esteemed was troubled to see him stain'd with so black an accusation as that of extortion is Not but that he knew well enough that accusations are not always true he had seen abundance of instances in his own time where the Accusations fell back upon the Heads of the Accusers as it happened to  Courbier  and some others But because this memoir was so conceived as to have all the appearances of truth the King knew not well what to say of it and would not so much as speak of it but the Duke  D'Elbeuf  finding that the Farmers of the Kings revenues asked much more for the Government of  Rue  than it was worth because  D'Augincourt  had offered them Money he had recourse to the King that he might not fall into their Hands  His Majesty who remembred what the other had said to his disadvantage instead of answering him so obligingly as he used to do told him only that he would consider of it The Duke who knew his Majesties humour which is to be kind and obliging even to Persons of far less quality than he concluded presently from this answer that some person had done him an ill office He did all he cou'd  for some days to discover who it might be and knowing that  D'Augincourt  had an Eye upon the  Government  of  Rue  he was almost perswaded that he was the Man His Ingratitude to his late Master was enough to make him entertain these thoughts of him yet that he might be more assur'd of it he spoke again to the King and begg'd to know if he had as yet considered of his Request as he had promised to do His Majesty told him that he had thought of it but it could not be granted him for some Reasons which he was unwilling to tell him The Duke  D'Elbeuf  was yet more surprized at this Answer than he was at the first and was more perswaded than ever that the King was not well pleased with him and therefore he supplicated His Majesty with the greatest Earnestness that he would be graciously pleased to tell him what it was that he had to lay to his Charge His Majesty answered him that he had resolved to conceal it from him that thereby he might save him the trouble which the knowledge of it would certainly give him But since he was so very earnest to know it he would tell him plainly that he had received a Memoir against him wherein he was accus'd of extortioning the People who lived under his Jurisdiction 'Tis true the Duke  D'Elbeuf  who is not very rich and who loves to live great and therefore had need to make the best advantage of every thing had us'd his utmost Skill and Industry in looking narrowly after his Affairs so that nothing that did of right belong to him could escape him but how much soever he look'd after his own Interest yet he had never been an Extortioner and he could not endure that he should be unjustly accused of it And therefore he requested His Majesty that Inquiry should be made into it He told him that he who was but a Young man had rashly done some things in his time which his Majesty could not approve of that he most humbly begg'd pardon  for them as he had also done when he was first charged with them but that he was content to lose his Head if ever he was in the least guilty of what was now laid to his Charge The King who was prepossessed with an Opinion that  D'Augincourt  would never have dared to have given him the Memoir if he had not been well assured that what it contain'd was true especially since he lived in the Neighbourhood where he pretended that the Duke had been guilty of the Extortions answered him that he would not at all advise him to search this matter to the bottom least perhaps it might prove more to his hurt than he expected and that at least it was probable it would prove so This answer afflicted him yet more than any of the former Answers had done and therefore he continued to solicit His Majesty that he would be pleased to allow him to justify himself The King turned away from him to speak to another Person of Quality to whom he had something to say And the Duke  d'Elbeuf  going out with an heart full of Sorrow resolved to employ all his own and his friends Interests that he might be allowed to clear himself of this Calumny As he went out of the Antichamber he found  D'Augincourt  with one of his Friends at the door of the Guardhall he took him aside to speak to him in private  D'Augincourt  left his friend alone and the Duke asked him if perhaps he was not the Man who had given the King a certain Memoir of which his Majesty had been just now speaking to him  D'Augincourt  who had so much Impudence as to speak ill of his dead Master by whose favour it was that he had acquired all that he was worth was impudent enough to own in the Dukes face that he was the very Man and which was more he told him that he had promised to the King to make good every thing that was in that Memoir and that e're it was long he would  be as good as his word The Duke was so wise as not to do as the Marquis  de Barbisieux  had done when he fell into his hands But instead of that he contented himself to tell him that he was satisfied to know how far his Impudence had carried him that he might come to be treated as he deserv'd at another time and in another place that he would take notice of him and at last he threaten'd him that he would cause him to be cudgelled to death for a Rascal as he was  D'Augincourt  went and complain'd to the King and demanded Justice of him The King told him he was ready to do him Justice but he must first prove what he had alledged against the Duke  d'Elbeuf  who expresly denied all that he had charged him with And if he had calumniated him without ground then the Duke had much more reason to demand Justice than he had The Duke return'd to wait upon the King and requested him to appoint Judges to enquire into that matter for if that were not done his Reputation shou'd be brought into question and that it was not just that in prejudice of his Innocence any credit should be given to such a lying Wretch as  D'Augincourt  He told him at the same time the designs that  D'Augincourt  had upon the Government of  Rue  and that he had taken this method of calumniating him fearing least otherwise he should not be able to carry it against him The King who is extreamly prudent and judicious began to perceive how the matter stood as soon as he heard this and he guess'd that Jealousie and interest had made  D'Augincourt  do what he had done and therefore he allowed that the Duke should clear himself and promised to name Judges for that Affair and which was more he told him that if he found  D'Augincourt  had accused him falsly he should cause to inflict any Punishment upon him that the Duke thought fit But the Judges were not named for some time  after insomuch that now when I am writing these  Memoirs  this Affair is not as yet ended  The young  Beaus  of the Court were become so profligate that many lewd Women came to be in vogue among them and among the rest the Women of the Playhouse and the Opera But there were some others besides them who came to be as much esteemed as they were and especially one  Mademoiselle Chambonneau  the Daughter of a Gentleman of  Poiton  who finding her self every way fitted for Amours thought it was pity to bury so good Qualities in an obscure Country place and therefore she came to  Paris  where she might set them forth in the view of the finest City and of the finest Court in the World Prince  Philip  was one of her first Admirers but he dying soon after there were others succeeded him who were fully equal to him both for Personal Worth and Quality so that she was no looser by the Change But before I say any more of her I beg leave to give an account of a silly Impertinence of the Marshal  de Milleraies  Lady who is the most whimsical Woman in the World as to what concerns Quality  This Prince had not lived a very Christian Life at least so far as appeared to the View of the World And there was a devout Lady who soon after his Death said in a publick Company where the Marshal's Lady was that his Salvation was much to be doubted of considering how irreligiously he had lived that many People had been Witnesses of his Debaucheries but none had ever heard of his Repentance The Marshal's Lady answered that she confessed that all that was true but that God was merciful especially to a Person of Prince  Philip  's Quality and that since God was good to all Mankind he would be much more so to such a Man as he was and when it came to the damning of a Person of so great  Quality God would think twice upon it before he did it The Lady to whom she made this Answer would not let her pass with it though she knew her weak side and that she was but a magotty Woman about these things and therefore she could not hope for much satisfaction from any thing she could say about them  But to return to my Subject  Madam Chambonneau  being the Widow of a Person of such a Character and being married to a second Husband who is yet more of it all the young People of Quality resorted to her House Her new Husband was not at all jealous of her and allow'd her to see every body And she got a good number of young Favourites about her out of which she was sure to make a choice of such Debauchees as were most agreeable to her humour especially the Count  de Donsi  eldest son to the Duke  de Nevers  a Man of as odd a Temper as his Father is and to give his Character in one Word I need only say that he has all the Vices of the  Manchinies  yea and surpasses them in two things that are extreamly shameful in any man but especially in a Person of his Quality He can scarce speak a word without adding the Name of God to it and Blasphemes as often as he speaks And as for Drinking it would seem that in what place soever he is  Bacchus  had set up his Throne and kept Court there Yet these are the two great Qualities he boasts most of whereas he ought rather to consider them as very dangerous Distempers for in my opinion he who is become a Slave to two such disgraceful Vices may justly look upon himself as the most wretched and miserable of all Mortals Notwithstanding all this he is so very comely and handsome in his Person that were he as sound in the Head as he is well shap'd in the Body we might easily excuse not only this  Mad Chambonneau  but many others who after her  Example should show some Affection for him▪  This Counts Father who is sordidly penurious in some things tho' in others he seems rather to be prodigal did not allow him so much as one farthing of Money which was the reason that he had neither Servants nor Equipage Perhaps he would have had him to go to the Market as he did himself for we must know that when the humour takes him he makes no scruple to go thither And 'tis pretty odd to see a Knight of the Holy Ghost with his blew Ribband in a Publick Market asking a Fruit woman how she sells her Fruit and her Carrots There was a man came once and told  Monsieur Baville  Intendant of  Languedoc  that he was seen doing so in the publick Market at  Montpellier  but he could not tell his Name for he that had seen him did not know him he sent immediately to all parts of the Town to know who this Knight of the Holy Ghost might be that was come thither and so soon as he knew that it was the Duke  de Nevers  he went to pay him a Visit and that he might engage him to reflect upon his own Conduct as unworthy of his Character he told him that he should not have known that he was in that Town but that it had been told him that he was seen in the Market that when he first heard of it he could not beleive it till it was confirm'd to him by so many People that at last he was forced to give credit to it lest he should seem to be too incredulous The Duke answered him that he had gone from his Lodgings with a design to pay him a Visit but that having thought it too early and that he would not be up so soon he had done after the Custom of  Italy  which allows Masters to go themselves and buy whatever they have a mind to eat that he knew it was not so in  France  but that for his part he never stood upon such small matters so that he might have the satisfaction to  have nothing upon his Table but what did relish with him  But this Man is of a singular humour in other things besides this especially in his way of Housekeeping For when he is not to have any Strangers at his Table he gives fifty Sols a day for himself and as much for his Lady to the Steward of his House who must therewith provide victuals for them both and as to his Servants he gives Ten Sols for every one of them so that he is in no great hazard of being cheated since the Steward can neither augment nor diminish the daily Allowance By this means its only when he entertains Strangers that any thing beyond ordinary is to be seen in his House and it's then that he uses to go himself to the Market which might be thought a sure Mark of a penurious Humour Were it not that there is one thing remarkable in his House that is not to be found elsewhere and that is that if another Man have one Cook and an Undercook This Duke has six or at least four of them for he has an humour that he will not suffer that one Cook should meddle but with one thing So that he who has the charge of the Roast Meat never meddles with the Ragoo's and he who has the charge of the Ragoo's meddles not with the more dainty Dishes and so of the rest  A Man of so singular an humour as this is could never allow his Son to live such a Life as he did he had already quit his House so as not to lodge in it and he thought it high time to give a check to his extravagant way of living he sent to him and warn'd him not to see Mad  Chambonneau  any more or else he knew what remedies to find for his Distemper He was afraid either that he should run himself into debt by spending too much with her or that he should be such a Fool as to marry her privately as was reported of him He had reason to look upon him as a Man that was capable of any+thing  that was foolish and extravagant though there had been no other ground for it but only this that he had taken upon himself the Title of a Duke though it did not all belong to him and which is yet worse had no ground to hope that ever it should belong to him for his Father's Patent is not for his Posterity but only for his own Life time So that when he comes to die his Family has done with that Title as it happened not long ago to Monsieur  Vieuville  By this we may easily judge of the Father's humour for he married his Lady when her Aunt Madam  de Montespan  was in greatest favour with the King and at her greatest height yet he neglected to have that Honour ensur'd to his Posterity and Family tho' it would have cost him nothing to obtain it if he had but asked it  However the Count  de Donsi  who had heard that while his Father was a young Man he had liv'd much after the same manner that he did himself now while he was also young and that he could not justly challenge him for copying after his example answered the Gentleman whom his Father had sent to him that he could not think of leaving  Paris  as he would have him do The Duke procur'd a letter  de Cachet  from the King for comitting him to the Bastile  Mad  Chambonneau  went the first and second day after he was taken up and wandered up and down about the Castle to try if perhaps she might see him upon the Terrass or in the Windows but she dar'd not adventure to go in and inquire for him for they had threatned to put herself in Prison if she should be found in a disguise offering to pay him a visit But she was so much a  Coquette  that in two or Three days she became indifferent whether she should ever see him again or no she troubled herself no more about him but considered him as a dead Man because he was no more in a condition to do her service Only she thought fit to keep some rules of decency with him and therefore  she wrote some Letters to him and expressed herself as tenderly as if she had loved him as much as ever and even imployed  Mademoiselle de Soissons  who's conduct is not much approved of by those who are concerned in her Person and Interest that she might assure him of it  Mademoiselle de Soissons  went twice or thrice to the Bastile to deliver her Commission and it may be she was glad of the opportunities that she might see him her self But the Duke  de Nevers  who was jealous of her and to whom the Governour of the Castle would not refuse any favour because he ow'd his Fortune to Cardinal  Mazarin  the Dukes Uncle prevailed so far that she was stopt at the Gate and not suffered to enter as if it had been by order from his Majesty This was a notable affront for this Princess who tho' she was warned of what was to befall her yet could not believe that the Governour dar'd do such a thing because she was grand Niece of the same Cardinal to whom he had been Captain of the Guards  But as he had learned from him to make no great account of any sort of People but of those who were rich and powerful and she being neither the one nor the other because of the many Disasters that had befallen her family he got soon over those considerations that so he might gratify the Duke She might have complained of this to the King if she durst have spoken to him but his Majesty was far from having any esteem for her and he had already caused notice to be given her that if she did not alter her conduct he would be obliged to send her orders that would not at all please her and therefore she had rather put up the affront and be silent than by complaining to put his Majesty in mind that she did not live as a Lady of her quality ought to do Yet the King did not forget her so soon he remembered her more than ever now that the  Duke of  Burgundy  had married the Princess of  Savoy  The honour that  Mademoiselle de Soissons  had to be of the same Family that the Princess is of made him often reflect how unworthy it was of her Character and Quality to live as she did and seeing she would not be reclaim'd by what was said to her either from the King or from her Friends he sent her a Letter  de Cachet  to depart out of the Kingdom  Her Sister  Mademoiselle Carignan  got also a secret rebuke though her conduct was not altogether so disorderly as hers was yet she came to be talked of as conversing too frequently with a certain Duke who was married The King therefore sent to her and offered her an Apartment at  Versailles  upon condition that she would take a Governess of his naming She had one already who was as old a Woman as any I know and  Mademoiselle Carrignan  took occasion from this to excuse her self for not accepting the honour which his Majesty had designed for her and she told those who spake to her from his Majesty that it would occasion the death of her old Governess if she should now put her a way when she had been so long time with her that it would look like a Tacite Accusation that she had not been so careful as she ought to have been of her Education that in all appearance she could not live long and that so soon as she was dead there could be nothing which she would so much rejoyce at as to make good use of the Favors which his Majesty was pleased to offer her  Mademoiselle de Carignan  having by this means got her self off she was very well pleased that she had thereby shun'd the constraint under which she should have been had she liv'd at  Versailles  She chose rather to keep her own little Court at the  Hotel de Soissons  than to be one of those who make  up the splendour at the Princesses Court The good old Woman Madam  de St Martin  who is her Governess was extreamly well pleased a  the answer she had made in the mean time the Duke was advertised of this and it was desired of him that he would take care not to pay her so many visits as he used to do lest the King should send her such another order as he had sent to her Sister  Mademoiselle Chambonneau  was in a great consternation when she heard of  Mademoiselle de Soisson's  fate she was affraid that since the King had dealt so hardly by a Person of her Birth he might come to deal more severely by her how small provocation soever she should give him she therefore intreated many of the young  Beaus  that frequented her house that they should come but seldom thither But he who had succeeded to Prince  Philip  having encouraged her by an Oath that he made to her that he would preserve her from all hazards she soon recall'd those whom so lately she had advised to seek for diversions elsewhere But there were two of them whom she endeavoured all she could to discourage from coming to her House because she thought neither of 'em fit for her purpose the one was the  Baillif D'Auvergne  eldest Son of the Count  D'Auvergne  who had already so much offended his Father that he had nothing to expect from him For he had forced him to ingage himself in the order of  Malta  and to give up his right of primogeniture in Favours of that Brother who was next to him in age The other was the  Chevalier de Kailus  a younger brother of the Marquis  de Kailus  who has married  Mademoiselle de Vilette  a Cousin of  Madam de Mantenons  This Man had not the same faults that the  Baillif de Auvergne  had yet he had as small a share in  Mademoiselle Chambonneau  's Favors as the other had though I know not upon  what account it was so And she endeavoured to set them at variance that by the one she might come to get rid of the other or rather that she might get rid of them both at the same time The best means she could think on for this was under pretence of Friendship to make every one of them believe that the other spake much to his disadvantage they easily believ'd what she said for each of them was perswaded that she loved him dearly and therefore thought it impossible that she could tell him any thing that was false They began then to look a squint upon one another but their Resentments were too strong to stop there They agreed to do one another Justice with Sword in hand and to try which of them  Madm de Chambonneau  should belong to They agreed to meet in the Court of the Abbey of St  Germain  and that the one of them should make as if he were going into the Church while the other was coming out of it that so it might seem that they had met only by chance for they knew how severe the King was to those that dar'd to transgress his Edicts and especially that which he had made against Duels they knew that he could never be prevail'd with to grant a Pardon to any Man who had been so unfortunate as to fall into that Crime  They met as they had appointed and drew their Swords but were parted before much blood was shed Yet the one of them wounded the other and each of them retir'd to a Friends house and resolved not to come abroad till they should know first if it was safe for them to appear but they had notice very soon that they should do well to lurk and that the King was no sooner informed of their fighting but that he had sent an Order to the Procuror General of the Parliament to enquire after that Matter The Count  d' Auvergn  went at the same time to  Versailles  and said to  the King that though he came to beg a favour of him yet it was not at all for his Son who had now of a long time behav'd himself so unworthily that he did not concern himself in any thing upon his Account  But seeing as the case stood if he was sentenced to die the like Sentence must necessarily pass against the  Chevalier de Kailus  who deserv'd much better than his Son did that his Condition and Circumstances should be regarded he did therefore upon his Account rather than upon his own supplicate His Majesty to give Orders that the whole Affair might be well examined for if there was any credit to be given to those who waited on his Son he had fought only upon an accidental Rencounter and without any premeditated design to transgress His Majesty's Laws It would have been a very extraordinary thing for a Father who what Faults soever his Son hath committed easily forgets them when his Life is at Stake thus to have expressed himself in good earnest but it was fit the Count should use some Art upon such an Occasion He knew that sometimes Prudence will oblige a Man to blame those who he designs should be found innocent especially when he is speaking to those whom they are accountable to for what they have done and who are offended with them For as one seldom gains any thing by opposing a passionate Man while his Anger is at its height but upon the other hand brings him soonest to Reason by seeming to go along with him in his Sentiments so it is with regard to a Prince who alledges that such a man has transgressed his Laws and therefore deserves to be punished However the King having given him as favourable a Reception as he could have desired answered him that both for his Sons sake and for the sake of the Chevalier  de Kailus  he wished that it might be found so  as he had heard but that he would be very soon informed of it for he had already given such strict Orders about it that it was altogether needless to give any more  In the mean time the King came to be informed that it was upon  Madam Chambonneau's  Account that they had come to fight and that she had industriously set them together by the Ears by her false Reports Upon which he sent a Letter  de cachet  ordering her to be banish d to  Rowan  There were some young Counsellors of that Parliament who got into a humour of courting her but she found a great difference between them and that great croud of Persons of Quality who used to frequent her House at  Paris  And being soon wearied of that Town she would have languished to death but that she hoped that her Friends would employ all their Interests to have her recalled But as among the vast number of Women who live as she did there are but few who are so fortunate as was  Ninon Lendos  that is there are but few of them who have the art to engage People to love them notwithstanding all the Lewdness they can be guilty of so those who had seen her at  Paris  forgot her much sooner than she thought of And at last having lost all her hopes she was so overwhelmed with grief that she died soon after  The Duke  de Nevers  who while she was at  Rowan  knew his Son's Character better than to be affraid that he would be at the pains to go thither for the Count  de Donzi  is a Man who can very soon forget both Friends and Mistresses the Duke  de Nevers  I say who had nothing to fear on that score got an Order to set him at liberty But it was upon condition that he should go to  Moulins  and wait there till the Duke  de Vendome  his Cousin with whom he had made the last Campaign and with whom he resolved that he should  make the next should be in a readiness to set forward for the Camp In the mean while  Madamoiselle de Soissons  left  Paris  in obedience to the King▪s Commands and went to her Mother a  Brussels  This Lady who while her Husband was alive had been an Honour to  France  as far as a costly and magnificent way of living can be accounted so had fallen on a sudden if I may so say from Greatness and Splendor into Poverty and Misery having been accused of poysoning her Hus+band for which she was forced to make her Es+cape into  Flanders  without having so much as Hours allowed her to put her Affairs in order If we may give credit to what she says herself she was altogether innocent of this Crime And it was her mortal Enemy the Marquis  de Louvois  who had forged that Accusation against her because she would never be in Friendship with him But whatever may be in this 'tis certain that at Court she has always been reputed guilty of that Crime Whether it be that she has still powerful Enemies there or that the King is convinced that she is not unjustly accused I cannot tell but there is not one that offers to espouse her Interests Before that  Madamoiselle de Soissons  went to that Country it was reported that she would go to  Avignon  and that  Madam de Soissons  her Mother would go and live there also because she could not live any longer at  Brussels  where every thing was so dear A certain Woman named  Vendome  who is well known at Court not by her Quality but because she brings thither Sallads for the King and Nobility which are better than any that comes from another hand hearing that this Princess was brought so very low and remembring her former Splendour that she had often seen was so touched with Compassion for her that she sent her as much Money as one of her small Stock  was able to spare and 'tis said that she received it yea and that she was very well pleased with it But this is what I cannot aver for a truth tho' I have heard it told to some Persons of the greatest Quality who may have known something of it themselves But I can scarcely believe that this Princess was ever reduc'd to so great Straits as to accept of so small a Summ as that was and at least I wish it may not have been so after having my self been Witness of the great Pomp she formerly liv'd in Yet it was commonly reported at Court that had not the Lady of a Foreign Prince's Minister supplyed her with Money she had not known how to satisfie her Baker and Butcher who dun'd her continually for the Money she ow'd them  Whatever was in this her Family has been in a declining State these Twenty Five Years past and is very much lower than it was before that time and this Princess's Son who should have raised it up again having been so lowspirited as to Marry a Girl who is unworthy of his Birth has been obliged to go out of the Kingdom because he found that he could not live in it with honour And if it be true that this Princes Mother was guilty of what was laid to her charge we may presume that all that has befallen her is the effect of Divine justice which doth not suffer that Crimes of this nature should continue unpunished  Madamoiselle de Soissons  was not the only Person whose Conduct the King endeavoured to reform he took much the same measures with  Madam de la Force  who is one of the two Daughters which the late Marquis  de Castelmoron  had left behind him the other was married to the Marquis  de Bricquemau  a Name well know among the French Protestants as well as that of  de la Force  But that Religion being now prohibited the Marquis  de Bricquemau  thought fit to obey the King  who Commanded all his Subjects to be Roman Catholicks  Madamoiselle de la Force  had already had many Intrigues which had made much noise and among others those with the Marquis  de Nesle  and with the President  de Brion's  Son This last had disgraced her yet more than the other because this President's Son was but of a very mean extract in comparison of her For without having recourse to the idle fancies of the Family of  la Force  which pretends to be descended of the Kings of  England  about which the Genealogists are not agreed or to what is pretended that the name of  Nompart  which they bear with that of  Caumont  was given them because one of their Ancestors killed a Dragon which destroyed all that Country where their chief Possessions and Interests in Land do now lie I say that without laying any stress on these things it is certain that the Family of  la Force  is a very Illustrious and a very Antient Family It has produced two Mareschals of  France  the one just after the other of the first of which the Father  Mainbourg  has given us a History which he has composed after his own fancy in his Book of  Calvinism  but he is so often mistaken in every thing that he has Written that a Man must be at pains to compose as many Volumes as he has done if he would take in hand to discover all his Mistakes But since we have occasion here to speak of this Mareschal who was called  James  I shall give a true and genuine account of what befel him at the Massacre of St  Bartholomew  quite different from what is given by that Jesuit  Charles  IX having formed a design to catch all the Protestants of  France  in one Net and at the same time made as many of them as he could especially of the leading Men among them come to  Court that he might cause them to be murdered so to speak in his own sight while by his Orders the same was to be done upon the same day and at the same hour in all the parts of the Kingdom It is not my business to tell here how it was possible that such a Design could be executed without being discovered before hand to those against whom it was formed besides that though I should make all the plausible Conjectures imaginable I could not expect to succeed better than they have done who have beat their Brains to tell us their Conjectures about it and at last I should be forced to confess as they do that it was a thing that God had resolved from all Eternity and that he put a vail before the Eyes of all those who were appointed to suffer that they might not know the imminent dangers that threatned them However this be  James  's Father being come to  Paris  where he was called by the King and having brought along with him his two Sons  viz James  and his elder Brother he and they were among the first who were assassinated  James  was but Fourteen Years old but was of a much readier wit than is usual for Boys of that age and he seigned himself dead upon his receiving the first blow that was the reason why he was left there and had no more wounds given him and lying stretched out at full length between his Father and his Brother who were killed dead he had also so much presence of mindas to take off a Diamond of great value which his Father had upon his Finger and to put it in his Mouth with an other which he had himself for he did not doubt but the People would soon come and strip them and take every thing that was about them and he was affraid that if he should keep nothing for getting his Wound cured and for maintaining himself in some private place till the storm were over he might come to be starved to death It happened just so as he had guessed would  all the People about the  Louvre  where his Father was lodged hearing what had been done came immediately to make all the advantages they could of the Cloaths of these murdered Protestants The Master of a Tennis Court that was in that part of the Town who knew Monsieur  de la Force's  Sons because they had play'd sometimes at the Tennis which he kept happened by good luck to come to their House when he was going a pillaging as well as others He was so touched with compassion when he saw them in that condition that he cry'd out and spoke of it aloud though he was all alone  James  who knew him thought that he might trust himself with him and tell him that he was not as yet dead The Master of the Tennis being overjoyed to see him yet alive bid him get up and go along with him and promised to keep him in his House and that he should not at all discover him but that he should be in as great safety with him as ever he had been in his own Father's house but because he had no Cloak to give him and that he could not go out naked as he was for another had already stript him of his Cloaths  James  therefore desir'd him to go and seek for one to him and to bring a Lanthorn with him that he might have the greater Benefit of his kind Offers The Master of the Tennis brought him all that he had desired and a Hat also and making him go before him as if he had been his Boy he brought him to his house where his Wife asked him who he was he told her that she was not concerned to know that and that she had nothing to do but to use him kindly She judged by this that he was some Huguenot of Note which she was yet more perswaded of when upon his Finger she saw the Diamonds which he had sav'd and she coveted very much to have them but not knowing any other way how to come by them she began to say to her Husband that she was very desirous he should  put him out of doors that she could not suffer him any longer to expose himself for his sake to those Inconveniencies that would inevitably befal him if it should ever come to be known that he had harboured such a Guest Her Husband who had been forced to tell her who he was that the hopes she might have of being well rewarded one day might give her satisfaction endeavoured to satisfie her with the same hopes But she had rather have what was present than what was but to come and she continued to press him that he would rid himself of this Stranger telling him that it seem'd he knew not well what he was doing when he put himself into so great hazard without any prospect of advantage The Tenniscourt keeper finding that he could not satisfie her with Reason advertised  James  of it that he might choose rather to go elsewhere than to expose himself to new Dangers  La Force  answered him that he would soon find a Remedy for that He knew that this Woman coveted his Diamonds because she had many times spoken to him of them he therefore gave her one of them which procured him peace and quiet for some days But because that which he had kept to himself was the finest of the two and that he had given her only the least her wicked humour returned very soon insomuch that she disturbed her Husband with her Importunities as much as before He who was a man of much honesty could not approve of her Behaviour and reproved her sharply for it But finding that she persevered in her Covetousness and that she valued her Interest more than any other thing he spoke to  Monsieur de la Force  that he might have a care not to make a Present to her of the other Diamond and he told him that it would be much better for him that he should go to one of his Friends houses and that if he knew any of them  with whom he could trust himself he would go himself and ask him if he could be in safety at his house  Monsieur de la Force  answered him that he knew none but  Monsieur de Biron  and he entreated him to go to his house as from him and that he knew him to be so generous that he hoped he would make no difficulty  o shelter him The Master of the Tenniscourt went thither and having asked a private Audience of him he was surprised and overjoyed at the same time when he told him that the young  La Force  was still alive  Monsieur de Biron  desired that he might come so soon as conveniently he could he came to his house immediately and that he might not be discovered  Monsieur de Biron  after he had discoursed a little with him put him in his Livery as one of his Pages and sent him to  Biron  He was cured of the Wound he received at the Massacre and having taken Post he stay'd in  Guyenne  till the Persecution of the Protestants was over He went afterwards to the War where he signalized himself so gloriously that he came to be in greater esteem than any of his Predecessors had ever been And he came to be so much in favour with  Henry  the Third and  Henry  the Fourth that he was made Master of the Kings Wardrobe and Captain of his Lifeguards He afterwards married  Monsieur de Biron  's Daughter in gratitude to him for having shelter'd him when he was in hazard of his Life and at last he was advanced to the Dignity of Duke and Peer and Marshal of  France  He died when he was Eighty years of Age Loaded with Riches and Honour His Son enjoyed all the same Honours and having but one Daughter she was married to  Monsieur de Turenne  The Dutchy of  la Force  fell to the Posterity of  James  's second Son who enjoy it at this time  Madamoiselle de la Force  of whom we are now discoursing was descended also of the same  James  who was her Grandfather but her way of living being altogether unworthy of the Grandchild of so great a Man who had lived always like a Man of true Honour and Vertue the King caused a Complement to be made her much like to that which had been made to  Madamoiselle de Soissons  he ordered that it should be told her that there were but two things of which she might choose one that was either to go out of the Kingdom or to go in to a Convent such an Order as this was like a Thunderbolt to this young Lady But as there is no disputing with the King she chose the Convent upon condition always that His Majesty should give her wherewith to pay her Board For though she had many Intrigues in her time yet she was so much a Beggar that she had not wherewith to maintain herself Perhaps had she been richer she would not have gone and buried herself alive within the Walls of a Cloyster but as Necessity forces many People to do many things which otherwise they would not incline to it was impossible for her to take any other course than what she did There was one  Madam Thaumur  who underwent the same Fate though she was married and her Husband Captain of the Gallies of  Versailles  yet he was so good natured as never to complain of her Conduct But the King who had declared openly before all the Court that he would not suffer any Person to give ill Example to another knowing that himself was charitable enough to comfort an old  Suisse  for the loss of his Wife caused her to be shut up among the penitent Maids  This frighted a great many Women whose Conduct was nothing better than hers while all good People approved of his Majesty's Resolution for the Reformation of Manners  He commanded the Archbishop of  Paris  that in his Station he should vigorously pursue the same design as well as he did That Prelate gave Orders to the Clergy of that great City that every one of them should enquire diligently within the bounds of his Parish after those who lived licentiously whether under the pretence of their Greatness or under pretence of Clandestine Marriage His Majesty's Care extended also farther than this Capital City for he sent the same Orders to all the Bishops of the Kingdom The Bishop of  Angers  had a Man in his Diocess who was rather rich than of Quality and who was in one of these two Cases It was the Count  de Serran  who had been Chancellor of  Monteur  he lived familiarly with one  Madam Racapee  but it was not known how they came to live together whether they lived in Whoredom or if there had been a Clandestine Marriage between them for these sorts of Marriages are much in fashion at this time insomuch that we seldom hear of any other The Bishop went and paid him a visit as he us'd frequently to do but after he had dined with him and with this Lady who ordered all the Affairs of his house he told him that he would not delay any longer to acquaint him with the Reasons that had obliged him to pay him that visit That His Majesty had commanded him to enquire of him what was the Relation he was in to that Lady who had the trust of every thing in his house For if she served him only for his pleasure and was not married to him he must resolve never to see her any more The Count  de Serran  knowing that his Wealth which made him absolute in that Country could do him no service in shifting a question that was put to him in the Kings Name was forced to own that they were married together The Bishop answered him that his owning of the Marriage was something and  that he could discourse willingly with him upon the reasons which he offered him at the same time for having so long concealed it but that all that was not enough for such an Answer as he must give the King That if it were only he who as Bishop of the place came to enquire after it he would believe it upon his word but since his business was with the King it was absolutely necessary to shew other Proofs for it The Count hearing him speak after such a manner went and searched for the Marriagecontract which he had made with this Lady and shewed him at the same time a Certificate of their Marriage He asked for no more and having given an Account of it to the King it has produced so good an effect that this Count owns it openly in his Family so that Madam  de Racapee  is now considered as his Lady  About this time the City of  Paris  came to have one of its principal Magistrates changed though this Office be neither ancient nor honourable I mean the Office of  Lieutenant de Police  which was at its first Institution in the year bestowed upon  Monsieur de la Reinie  who is still alive For there was never any such Magistrate before that time and all the parts of that Office were performed by the  Lieutenant Civil  But His Majesty considering that in so great a City as this Metropolis it was too great a Charge for one Man to attend particular Affairs and the more publick Concerns of the City at the same time he created this new Office in his Favour 'Tis true Political Reasons obliged him to institute it as much as Zeal for Justice did For the King had found by experience while he was under age that this City alone was capable by its example to cause an Insurrection throughout the who  e Kingdom And therefore he thought fit to have a Man there of his own Appointment in whom he might put confidence who might narrowly observe every thing that was done in the City He settled Twelve Thousand  Franks a year upon this Magistrate and  Monsieur de la Reinie  after he had discharged this Office for at least years becoming old and perhaps that he might complement the chief Minister of State desired him some years ago that he would give him his Nephew  Monsieur de Bignon  for his Coadjutor  As this Office gives a Man much Authority and Interest at Court upon which he immediately depends therefore  Monsieur Bignon  who is now Intendant of  Picardy  accepted of it by the Advice of his Parents and Friends but being of a Family that has been always obliging and full of humanity he became soon wearied of it for he saw that he could not discharge that Office unless he became severe and rigorous and therefore he made an Interest to be Intendant of a Province and obtained that of  Amie  s  In the mean while  Monsieur de Reinie  growing now very old for he is about Eighty years of Age supplicated anew that he might be eased of this Burden and that he might be allowed to sell his Office The King granted his request upon condition that he should resign in favour of  Monsieur d' Argenson  This Gentleman is of much better Quality than  Monsieur de la Reinie  and falls nothing short of him as to good sense besides that he has all necessary Qualities to make himself to be feared and his very Presence strikes dread if it doth not create respect His Father had been the Kings Embassador to the Republick of  Venice  and his Ancestors were equally famous for the Gown and for the Sword but 'tis seldom that a Man grows rich by Embassies and his Father who is still alive spent a good part of his own Estate in that Employment so that his Son had been forced to accept of an Office that was below him that is to be Lieutenant General of  Limoges  but his good Fortune having brought him to Court and having got some Commissions of which he so acquitted himself  that the Court was fully satisfied with what he had done he thereby opened the way to this Employment we are now speaking of The Lieutenant  de Police  is answerable to the Parliament of  Paris  and therefore  Monsieur D' Argenson  some days after he had entered upon his Office went and pay'd a visit to the chief President and begged the honour of his Protection This Magistrate who has a grave Aspect and affects to appear graver than he truly is received him the same way that he uses to receive all other People and heard his Complement without so much as moving an Eyebrow finding that he had done with it made him no answer but these Three Words  Safety Cleanness Light  and immediately turned his back upon him  Monsieur D' Argenson  would have been more surprised if he had not known his Character but having known it of a long time he returned home thinking what could be the meaning of these Three Words and he soon found it out He understood easily that by the first he meant that he should take care of the night Watch that no Robberies or Murders by Night might be heard of in the City By the Second that he should take care that those who had the charge of cleansing the Streets should punctually do their duty and by the Third that he should do the same as to those who have the charge of the Lanthorns These Three parts of this Office made  Monsieur Bignon  nauseate it and there were also some other things in it that were no less disagreable to such a Man as he is  However his niceness was much to  Monsieur de la Reinie's  advantage for he got Fifty Thousand Crowns from  Monsieur D' Argenson  for resigning his place to him and he would have got much more had not the King determined the Price The Lieutenant  de Police  pays no yearly  Tax to the King for his Office as all the Offices of Long Robe do except the Chancellor the Chief President of Parliament and And the King gave  Monsieur D'Argenson  a Warrant of Retension for a Hundred Thousand  Franks  He enter'd upon the Exercise of it by declaring War against all those whether Men or Women that used to play at Lansquenet He had express Orders for this from his Majesty because he had observed that in some Years before that unhappy Game as well as the other Game of Basset had ruin'd a great number of the Officers of his Army who had been forced to quit their Companies because they had lost all the Money with which they should have raised Recruits  Monsieur Bignon  Counsellor of State who was the Father of that Gentleman I was just now speaking of came to die suddenly about this time without having any time to prepare himself for another World He had gone to bed at Night after having taken his Supper as he used to do without complaining of any Pain or Sickness but the next Morning he was found dead in his Bed The Office of State which he had enjoyed would have been very convenient for his Son who had nothing else to hope for by his Death for all his Estate was not sufficient to pay his Debts But because the King had declared long ago that he would not at all make those Offices like Here  itary ones to descend from Father to Son he therefore thought it his interest to proceed cautiously in this matter and to take prudent measures before he should address himself to the King for it It was easier for him than it would have been for another Man to bring about this design because he was the Nephew of  Monsieur de Ponchartrain  who had served the King to very good purpose ever since the time that he was made ComptrollorGeneral in the place o  Monsieur le Pelletier  There were few who could have acquitted themselves in so difficult a post with so much Art and Success as he has done at a time when the publick Affairs were in such a posture as they have always been in since he was called to it Tis certainly matter of Wonder and of Amazement at the same time to see the difference betwixt the way of managing the King's Revenues at this time and that which was taken under the Ministry of Cardinal  Mazarin  For when there was need but of a Million they were at incredible pains and toil to contrive a way how to raise it Those who are acquainted with the History of those times know that when  Dunkirk  was taken in the year it could not be ransomed out of the Hands of the  English  because we had not Three Millions of Money to give for it for which Sum we could have recovered it by virtue of a secret Treaty with  Cromwell  so that the King was forced to add a Million more to that Sum when he redeemed it some Years after Besides it was needful then to use all the Political Arts and Pretences imaginable before that such a Sum could be raised Whereas now if the King had use for Fifty Millions he has nothing to do but to speak the word and he has it so to speak in a Quarter of an Hour However  Monsieur Pontchartrain  did not rely so much upon his own Merits as upon that account to flatter himself with the hopes of obtaining this favour to his Nephew because of some difficulties which he foresaw must be removed before he could speak of it to his Majesty The great difficulty was that the King had promised to  Monsieur de Caumartin  Intendant of the Kings Revenues the first place that should fall void among the Counsellors of State He knew that the King was mindful of his Promises and that he would not forget them but for very good Reasons and therefore he spake to  Monsieur de Caumartin  and told him he would oblige him very much  if he would quit his Pretensions in Favour of his Nephew As every Man loves to oblige a Minister of State so  Monsieur Caumartin  promised not to do any thing that could put his Majesty in mind of what he had promised him but the King remembred it himself so that when  Monsieur de Ponchartrain  spoke to him for  B  gnon  he answered that he was very sorry he could not grant what he asked of him but there were two Reasons that hindred him from doing it The one was that he had resolved not to set th  se Offices pass from Father to Son The ohter was that he was under a promise to give  Monsieur Caumartin  the first of those places that should f  ll  So  Monsieur Caumartin  was made Counsellor of State though he was willing to have renounced it at  Monsieur de Pontchartrain  's desire The first time that he sat in Council he pretended to take his Place as if he had been always there from the first Day he was named Intendant of the Revenues because these Intendants have a Brief of the Crown as Counsellors of State but those whom he would have taken place of if he had succeeded in his Claim opposing him in that matter the Chancellor who was proper Judge in it determined it in their Favour Two or Three days before  Monsieur de B  gnon's  Death his Brother who was chief President of the great Council fell sick when his sickness appeared dangerous for he died of it within Six or Seven days after no body would tell him what had befallen his Brother lest he should become Apprehensive that he should soon follow him  But because his Brother had come to see him in the beginning of his Sickness but could not come afterwards for he was in his Grave he asked the only Daughter he had if he had already forgotten him He had married this Daughter to  Monsieur de Verthamont  Master of Requests who was already one of the Richest Men that wore a Gown but who came to be much Richer by succeeding him in  his Estate for this  Monsieur Bignon  had incomparably a greater Estate than his elder Brother He was worth at least Four Hundred Thousand Crowns yet his Daughter was nothing the happier for that for her Husband did not love her at all either because he thought she had not Beauty enough to deserve that he should love her or because he was too much inclin  d to We  ching to love a Wife for it was known that he had Mistress  s and she was forced to behave herself obligingly to them and to keep  with them that so she might be often in company with her Hu  band for she had as much Affection for him as he had Indifferency for her  Monsieur de Verthamont's  Inclinations to the Female Sex his been  enough known of a long time though somewhile and he  ell thereby into such an Inconvent me as might have discouraged him from  for the  He was in love with a young Girl that had so me Brothers who were Office  s in the  She was at least of as good a Family as had as but th  was a vast diffrence betwixt th  is Fortunes and the was a  poor as he was rich The  their Sister to comply with him  take  Measures as should  to give her a Portion Perhaps she  though they had not advised her to it and if we may believe what is repor  of her she loved him as much as he loved her However this Girl having given him an  is surprised him with her and  to be  hard upon him if he would not do them Justice H  offered them a considerable Sum of Mercy i  they would let him go He had it not about him for it was a greater Sum than a Man usually carries in his Pocket but having given them his No  e he thought it even best to pay it without more ado that his misfortunes might not come to be talked of  If a certain Knight of the Holy Ghost who is now at Court could have thus compounded the matter with his Lady's Brothers perhaps he had never married her But these Gentlemen were not for capitulating on such Terms as the Brothers of the former Girl had done he was forced against his Will to yield to their Terms besides that it may be his Note would not have been so well answered as was  Monsieur de Verthamont  ▪s  But that I may not go farther from my Subject I say that this Magistrate's Lady having by some pretence or other satisfied her Father when he complained that his Brother came not to see him he died without knowing that he was gone before him and that he had payed that debt that all men must necessarily pay Though his Office was but of a late Creation yet there were abundance of Candidates for it for the place of Chief President and especially of such a famous Society as is the Great Council is not to be slighted when there is a fair opportunity of obtaining it But the King who has always a great regard to the Children of his Ministers when the Offices they have enjoyed may without any bad Con  equence be disposed of as if they were hereditary bestowed it upon Monsieur  de Verthamont  For the reason why the Places of Counsellors of State should not be so disposed of is that if the King should let them descend to the Children or to the nearest Kinsmen he should not have wherewith to reward those who serve him faithfully in the Counsel and in the other Offices of the Gown For they serve not for any other end but that one day they may come to be Counsellors of State at least the hopes of this has been their great motive for some time past because we see that the King has chosen Two or Three of that Body to be Chancellors of the Kingdom and therefore every one strives to recommend himself to his Majesty by his  diligence in his Service whether in the Intendancies or in any other Commissions We may easily be convinced how much it is for the Kings Interest to have Persons of this sort about him and perhaps he should not find them so exact and punctual in the discharge of their Duty if it were not that they have always that recompence in their View as the fruit of all their Labours  There were Two other Brothers died some days after the death of the Two  Bignons  and there was one strange thing observed of them that never any thing happened to the one but what befel the other at the same time they were Twins and so like one another in the Face that had not the one been a Soldier and the other a Lawyer so that their different Garbs made them known the one would have been often taken for the other They were both much given to gaming and if one lost his money it was sure the other lost his also at the same time When he who went to the Army was wounded the other was wounded also by a fall or some other Accident If the one had a Mistress that jilted him the other met with the same Treatment from his In a word all the difference that ever was taken notice of was that the one continued a Batchelor much longer than the other and there was nothing wanting in their whole life but that one thing to justifie what is ordinarily said of Children that are born at the same Birth That whatever happens to the one inevitably befals the other But perhaps he who continued a Batchelor so long after the other was married did so because he thought his Brother not very happy in his Marriage There are some Wives who give no great Encouragement to Men to venture upon Marriage especially when they set up for Wits and will pass a judgment upon every thing It is the two  Bauquemars  of whom I am now  speaking the one of them was Marishal  de Camp  and Governour of  Bergues  the other President of Requests of the Palace The King gave this Government to the Count  de la Motthe  Nephew of the late Marshal  d  la Motthe H  udanc  ur  who was also Marishal  de Camp  The Count  a  Brion  eldest Son of  Monsieur le Grand  and who had the survivance of Master of Horse to the King fell at this time into an Ap  plex  though he was not at most but Thirty Five Years of Age And it was so extreme vi  l  nt that his Face was dis  orted to that degree that not only his Mouth stood aw  y but what was yet more  mazing one o  his Eyes came d  wn int  the Middle of his Face His Father and Mother sent him to the Waters of  B  urbon  and as he was up  n h  s Journey thithe  he sell into an  t  er  it of the same Disease so that it was beli  ved he was quite gone yet he recovered of it as he had do  e of  he first and having made out hi  J  urney the Waters a  d the n  tural strength of his Youth r  covered h  m to a  etter State of Heal  h The K  g  as al  a  s loved his Fat  was  o goo  as to  how glad he was at hi  R  covery Bu  gave  Ma  ame la    nd m  r  sensible  roofs of  every body She had a  c  cerning the Inheritance of  which she alleged  King alle  ed the contrary  to be well  ou  ded because  wh  ch the De  te  the Portion of one of the Sons of  F  ance  and re  urned always to the  were n  t Heirs ma  e to enjoy it  Madame la grande    his fi  st Cousin was not very rich  gi  e her only Sixty Thousa  d  of  for which reason it is that she travels only with one Co  ch which is  not very becoming a Princess of the Blood and especially a Granddaughter of  Henry  IV the King I say considering her Poverty and that besides she had some Reasons for her Claim which seem'd to answer his own Reasons told her that if she pleased he would let her enjoy her Sister's Estate during her Life upon condition that she should renounce the Property of it This Princess who desired only to be rich by the Revenue without troubling her self with what might happen after her Death consented very willingly to this Proposal But His Majesty has since that time had some scruples of Conscience because he had only given her the Profits of that Estate during her Life which perhaps belonged to her in Property and therefore he has resigned the Property in her Favour as he had formerly done the Revenue This tenderness of Conscience that will not allow this Prince to do any thing for which it may reproach him had made him reflect often upon many things that had passed during his Reign which might be represented in other Colours than those were which had been made use of to perswade him to undertake them He saw that his whole Kingdom was in a Flame and that there was no other way to extinguish it but by restoring a great number of Places which his Enemies alleged he had taken only by force of Arms and because he found it for his own conveniency to have them without having any other right to them If he had pleased he might perhaps not only have let all  Europe  see the contrary since he can give good reasons for what he has done but he could have also maintain'd his right to those Places  y his Arms since in despite of the prodigious Consederacy that has been form'd against him he has always had the advantage of his Enemies ever since he first perceived their Designs against his Crown  However as His Majesty has of a long time been chiefly concerned with his eternal Salvation the care of which has made many scruples arise in his Conscience So we admired and were astonished to see that on a sudden he had offered to deliver up the Towns of  Strasburg  and  Luxenburg  which were the strongest Barriers of his Kingdom Nay he offered also to deliver up many others which it must be confessed were taken airly with Sword in hand when his Enemies were Witnesses of his Victories and could no longer resist his Arms though they were all assembled against him so that it seems just to say that he had a right to keep them or at least to demand the Equivalent of them But the King considered that  would break this dreadful Conspiracy and restore Peace to his People who groan'd under  e Burthen of the most cruel War that ever was raised against any Soveraign he must part with his own Interests He had sent long ago the  Steu  de Calli  rs  to  Holland  to make Proposals of Peace He addressed himself to that People rather than to any others because he knew that the States which subsist only by Trade would hearken sooner than any of the rest would do when one spoke to them of putting an end to a War which troubled them upon all quarters Besides the  Dutch  could gain nothing by the Continuance of it for they were not like the House of  Austria  which flatters it self that by the Continuance of War it shall at last recover that supreme Power that it once had in the time of  Charles  the Fifth There was not one of the All  es except only this House who could hope to make any advantage of what was then doing in  Europe  Insomuch that it may be justly said that all the Princes who were in that Confederacy had taken up Arms only for the Interests of the House of  Austria  for all the Conquests they could hope  for from the King must have belonged to it And though the Princes of the Empire had other Pretensions yet seeing they find by long experience that the Emperor makes use of them if I may be allowed to speak so only as the Ape made use of the Cat's Foot to take the Chesnuts out of the Fire and that he has always known how to make use of the Right of Sequestration to which he pretends to his own advantage and their loss and that at the Peace of  Nimiguen  he kept  Philipsburg  to himself though it belonged to the Bishop of  Spire  They could therefore easily see that they exhausted themselves only for his sake and that they could expect no Benefit by it themselves And though they had run headlong into the Confederacy against his Majesty when it was propos'd to them yet that was only because of the Fears they were under from the Greatness of his Power They considered that it was their misfortune to have their Dominions lying between Two Princes whom they ought equally to suspect and that they should do best to declare against him who seemed to be in the greatest readiness to ruine them rather than against the other who was not as yet in a condition to hurt them These were the considerations that formed the Bonds which united them so firmly with the Emperor and which became the more indissoluble that his Imperial Majesty found a way how to keep these Princes in a dependance upon him by making them believe that the King had violated the Treaties of  Munster  and  Nimiguen  and was a sworn Enemy of the Empire It was not in His Majesty's Power at that time to address himself either to them to inform them of his good Intentions or to the  English  because they had set a Prince upon their Throne whom His Majesty had not acknowledged as their lawful King and whom he also considered as the very Soul of the confederacy that had been form'd against him It  is true the  Hollanders  had a sort of dependance upon this new King both because he was their Stateholder and because of a strict Union between him and the chief Men of their Republick Yet as His Majesty was resolved to acknowledge this Prince at last for King of  England  so he believed that what Bonds soever might be betwixt him and the  Dutch  they would never coldly entertain the Proposals which he cesigned to make them especially when they should see that by removing this one Obstacle there would be no great difficulty to obtain a general Peace And truly  Monsieur de Callieres  needed not to have been at great pains to make them sensible what were like to be the ill Consequences of the War as well for themselves as for the Princes of the Empire that he might thereby perswade them that it was their Interest to concur with His Majesty in restoring Peace to  Europe  They knew their own Interests too well not to be sensible that their own Safety as well as the Safety of many other Potentates consisted in keeping  France  and  Austria  in a Ballance or to speak more properly in keeping them in equality to one another seeing they serve as Counterweights to all the Princes of  Christendom  to save them from falling under the Power either of the one or the other For just as in a Ballance we see that when one side is much heavier than the other if a sufficient Weight be put into that other Scale then both are equal so has it always been since these Two Families interfered with one another All the Princes of  Europe  have acted by the same Rule in assisting the weakest of the Two and putting a stop to the growing Power of the other And this Maxim is observed at this time and has put the Sword in the Hands of so many Potentates who were formerly in His Majesty's Interests especially the  Hollanders  and the Princes of the Empire who found no Protection either  so ready or so safe as his was when they were like to have been subjected to the House of  Austria  However the  Hollanders  finding by the Proposals the King made and his Offers to deliver up so many Places that if they could not bring these Two Houses to a just Equality yet they should at least make a Peace upon such Terms as that they needed not be so very much afraid of His Majesty's Power they gave  Monsieur Callieres  a very favourable Reception yet they would not grant him a Passport but by allowance from the Prince of  Orange  And before they would enter into any Conferences with him they would first see if the Powers he had brought from His Majesty were in good form But they could be in no better form than they were since they were sealed with the Great Seal of  France  There was one thing that much hindred this Treaty which was that the  Hollanders  would do nothing without the Consent of  England  and their other Allies But this was nothing but what  Monsieur Callieres  expected For before he came from  France  he doubted very much that he could perswade them to enter into a separate Treaty with the King Yet that had been done at the Treaty of  Nimeguen  where his Majesty's Plenipotentiaries found a way how to make them jealous of the Prince of  Oran  e  's Power so that they made hast to make a separate Peace which did soon oblige all the other Allies to an Accommodation with the King But it was not fit at this time so much as to propose what they were able then to effectuate The  Dutch  became sensible of their mistake and they would take care not to fall into it again But  Callieres  who as I have said had considered of this before and who had Orders from the King not at all to acknowledge the Prince of  Orange  for King of  England  till he should be assured of the Peace found out an expedient  for reconciling the Orders he had from the King his Master with this difficulty which the  Dutch  made not to treat without the Consent of their Allies It was that they should not come to a final Conclusion in any thing without their Approbation but if they found reason to agree to any thing they might communicate it to them and that convenient measures might be taken afterwards There was no Inconveniency in following this Advice and the  Dutch  were satisfied with it and by Consent of their Allies too They demanded as Preliminaries of this Treaty the Restitution of  Lorrain  and of the Towns of  Strasburg  and  Luxenbourg Callieres  consented in the Kings Name both to the one and the other but upon Condition that  Lorrain  should be restored to the Duke of that Name upon such Terms as had been agreed to at the Treaty of  Nimeguen  The President Can  n who took care of the Duke of  Lorrain's  Interests in  Holland  opposed this under Pretence that when his Master engaged in the Confederacy it was promised that Peace should never be made till he had full Satisfaction He represented to the Confederates that if his Dominions were not restored to him but upon the Terms of the Treaty of  Nimeguen  he should be so far from reaping any advantage by the Confederacy that he should be a loser by it since he could have made a much better market had he taken other methods by which he might have been put in possession of his Dominions before the War but having thought himself oblig'd to follow his Fathers example who would not hear of these Conditions near Twenty Years ago it was very hard for him now after so many Years to find that no better Conditions were offered him  But as great Potentates who are well pleased to engage those in their interests who are much inferiour to them in Power that they may be the more  successful in their designs take not much care of their concerns when they have no more use for them so the Allies after having spoke once or twice of this Affair thought it not worth their while to insist any longer upon it Mr  President Canon  gave in several Memoirs concerning it and they told him that they would take time to consider them before any thing were concluded And though the Emperours Ministers joyned with him for obtaining full satisfaction to this Duke yet neither the one nor the other were able to effectuate any thing Things being thus far advanced upon the part of the Dutch and the English having as strong Inclinations for a Peace as they had because of the many Prizes that were taken from them at Sea which had brought their Trade very low It was agreed upon all Hands that Plenipotentiaries should be named for bringing that to perfection which as yet was only begun but they had some difficulty to agree upon the Place of the Congress The Emperour would have had it in some Town of  Germany  and the King would not hear of that proposal But his Imperial Majesty's great desire was to Protract time for he was not very desirous of the Peace because so long as the War should last he knew that he was Master of all the Princes of the Empire who were obliged to obey his absolute Commands and he was afraid that if the Peace should be concluded they might come to open their Eyes and be sensible of their true Interests and to perceive that in being so earnest for the Increase of his Power they should themselves be the Authors of his Usurpations upon their own Liberties and Prerogatives But there was also another thing in his View in which he consulted his own Interest when he desired that the Treaty might be in some Town of the Empire For since the Peace with  Savoy  the King was superior in Forces to all the Confederates having sent all the Troops which had serv'd  in that Country from thence into  Germany  And the Emperour was afraid lest  Mentz  should be besieged which would have been no difficult Enterprize had the King thought fit to employ his Forces that way  But if he could not obtain that  Mentz  should be the Place yet he thought at least they would be satisfied that  Frankfort  should be it And that a Neutrality should be established for or Leagues round about that Town so that  Mentz  should be comprehended in it But the King being stiff in this matter and the  Dutch  having propos'd the  Hague  for the Place of Meeting it was  agreed to that those whom His Maiesty should name for his Plenipotentiaries should reside at  D  lf  which is  ut One Leagues distant from it and  were to be named by the other Princes  reside at the  Hague  and that the Conferences should be kept at the Castle of  Rys  wick  which stands in the middle and is equally distant from these Two Places  Though the Emperor consented to this as well as the rest of the Confederates yet it was a long time before he sent his  thither which was a Proof that he loved maner that the War should continue than that a Peace should be concluded  s for the King he made no de  ay to name  Monsieur Courtin  Counsellor of rate his Plenipotentiary a Man every way capa  le of such an Employment and who had acqui  ted himself very honourably in many Negotiations of great Importance But he befought the King to excuse him in this because he found his Eyes so bad that it was to be fear'd he should lose his sight altogether It vexed the King to think that he m  look out for another and he was at pains to examine him if perhaps there were some secret Reasons which hindred him from embracing this Employment but having at lust found that  in good earnest he nam  d in his place  Monsieur de Harlay  the Chancellor's Soninlaw who is also a Counsellor  of State He gave him  Monsieur do Creci  for his Colleague and honoured also  Monsieur de Callieres  with the same Title of Plenipotentiary There were great things talk'd of this Man's Conduct though I do not see that there was need of much Art to do all that he did for a man has no occasion to show how well he is qualified for Negotiations of State unless he have to struggle with great difficulties which at last he overcomes by his prudent Conduct and brings the whole affair to a happy Issue for the Interest of the Prince that has imployed him But this could not be said of  Monsieur Callieres  who had made the Confederates listen to his Proposals only by promising in the Kings Name that he would deliver up to them a great number of Places which they could not have been able to retake by force of Arms in Twenty Years time though they had been much stronger than they were  Monsieur de Harlay  had been already employed in some secret Negotiations but had not been successful in them but he and  Monsieur Callieres  had a third Person joyned with them in the great Affairs they were now to be employed in who could direct and assist them when they met with difficulties that were too hard for them I mean  Monsieur de Creci  who is one of the best qualified Men in  France  for Affairs of this nature He and  Monsieur de Harlay  took their Journey together that they might be at the place of the Congress in due time but they were not very well satisfied with one anothers Company  Monsieur de Harlay  was d  ssatisfied because  Monsieur de Creci  's Reputation eclipsed his own and  Monsieur de Creci  because  Monsieur de Harlay  carried it so high as if he had undervalued him  The Dispositions they were both in made them soon give some Proofs that they were dissatisfied with one another for being come to  L'Isle  there was  one  Le Normand  a FarmerGeneral who took upon him to Regale them He was one of  Monsieur de Creci  's Friends upon which account he detain'd them there a whole day longer than they intended to have staid And that they might not blame him for making them lose so much time he gave them Flying Coaches to carry them Ten or Twelve Leagues farther on their Journey but he put his Friend  Monsieur de Creci  into the finest Coach with the finest Horses in it while  Monsieur de Harlay  got but a sorry Coach and Horses with such Collars as draught Horses use to have instead of Harness This vexed  Monsieur de Harlay  very much who presumed that if there was any distinction to be made between them it should have been to his advantage The FarmerGeneral might have perceived by his looks that he did not take it well of him and he was heard to say behind his Back that those who from nothing came to possess good Estates could never learn to behave themselves like Gentlemen However he made use of the Coach and Horses such as they were but gave not many thanks to him who had provided them  These Two Plenipotentiaries had met with a number of People betwixt  Paris  and  L'Isle  who wished them a good Journey and in the mean time besought them earnestly to put an end to their Miseries by concluding a happy Peace They were not at all surprized at this for before they took their Journey they knew how much  France  needed it And we may easily judge how much the Treasure of the Kingdom was exhausted when we consider what Taxes and Subsidies must have been paid to the King to enable him to resist so many Forces as had conspired against him He had no less than Men under Pay by Sea and by Lard which no doubt will appear incredible to Posterity It was necessary that People of all Ranks  and Conditions within the Kingdom should bear their Proportionable share of this Burthen so that in imposing the Taxes there was a necessity to do every thing so to speak by Weight and Measure that no man might be oppressed or obliged to pay more than his Proportion And this is what the King's Ministers have done with so much Conduct and Prudence that though every man is sensible of his own Loss yet it is nothing in comparison of what it would have been if those Affairs had been managed by Persons of less Skill and Art than they are However these Plenipotentiaries saw the same thing in  Flanders  that they had seen in  France  that is they saw that the People there were no less weary of the War than the  French  They likewise besought them with the greatest Earnestness to use their utmost Endeavours for succeeding in the Treaty which they were going to negotiate At last they came to  Delf  where the Houses were become so dear since the People of that Town knew that they were to come thither that they could scarcely be had for Money  While these things were a doing the ProcuratorGeneral whom the King had ordered to enquire into the matter of the Duel that had been fought between the Bailist  d' Auvergne  and the  Chevalier de Kailus  gave him an Account of the Discovery he had made in it But it was not at all to their advantage He reported that according to the  Affidav  t  's that were made before him it was far from having been an accidental Rencounter as their Parents had alledged that never Duel was more clearly proved and therefore he desired to know what Orders His Majesty would give about it His Majesty ordered that they should be Arraigned Indited and Tried as Criminals so that the same Officer having caused it to be published through the City by sound of Trumpet  as is usual upon such Occasions the Parliament met and outlawed them By His Majesty's Edict against Duels they ought to have been hang'd in Effigie But the K  ng consented privately to remit something of that Rigour because of the Kindness he had for their Parents and they were only condemned to lose their Heads which was accordingly executed at the  Greve  where their Pictures were put up but were not suffered to be long there For there were some People took them away about an hour after that is in the Twilight of the Evening These sorts of things are very ordinary in  France  insomuch that it's commonly said that there is not one Great Family in the whole Kingdom but what the like has happen'd to and what has had Ladies and Daughters of naughty Lives And therefore the Parents of these Two unhappy young Gentlemen were not much afflicted with the Loss of their Sons nor were less in favour at Court than they had been before▪ The Cardinal  de Douillon  who is the Bailiff  d' Auvergne  's Uncle made a Jest of what his Nephew had dore and of what had befallen him In which his Eminence was not like many other people who had rather be e  gaged in the most difficult Affair in the World than  e accountable for a Duel And it's certain that the  M  ssicurs de la Frette  could never extricate themselves out of those Troubles which they brought upon themselves or Years ago by quarrelling with the Prince  de Chalais  as they were coming out of the  Palais Royal  They  ght  against  our but though all of them or at least the greater part of them were of the first Fa  lies of the Kingdom nay though the P  pe himself interceeded for a Remission to them yet the King would never grant them one so that some of them died making their escape to one part others to another and of all those that were engaged in that Duel I know none alive  but the elder  La Frette  and the Marquis  de Flammarin  It is true the Marquis  d' Autin  the eldest Brother of  Monsieur de Mont  pan  lost his Life in this Quarrel having been wounded in the  Vena cava  so that he died upon the spot I  the Count  d' Auvergne  was afflicted for the loss of his Eldest Son he was in some measure comforted by what the Monks of  Cluni  did for one of his younger Sons when he was not thinking of it The Cardinal  de Janson  the King's Ambassador at  Rome  had desired that his Majesty might be pleased to recal him and the Cardinal  de Bouillon  had got a Commission to succeed him and he being Abbot of  Cluni  he visited that Abbey as he was going to  Rome  He is always very obliging and engages all that know him to wish him well So soon as he told these Monks that he was going to  Rome  and that perhaps he might never see them any more they replied that they should be very sorry if that should happen but if it should be the good will of God so to order it they would at least before they took leave of him give a Testimony of the deep Sense they had of that Kindness and Concern which his Eminence had always shown for them They told him no more of it that day but on the Morrow they ordered that a Bell should be toll'd for a meeting of the Chapter and then they chose  Monsieur d' Auvergne  who is the Cardinal's Nephew for his Coadjutor They brought this good News to his Eminence who knew not the cause of their meeting and they told him at the same time that since he was going to  Rome  and that it belonged to the Pope to confirm their Election they did not doubt but he should obtain that favour of his Holiness when ever he thought fit to ask it and they took leave of him with this Compliment for which his Eminence thanked them very heartily For this is one of the most genteel and most honourable Abbies in  France  though it be none of richest Yet  it has Seven or Eight Thousand Livres of Revenue But that for which it is most to be valued is that it has Benefices at it's Gift to the value of near a Million of Revenue so that the Abbot of this Place has many opportunities to make new Creatures to himself and to reward those whom he has already  The Cardinal  de Bouillon  would fain have carried along with him  Monsieur de Coulanges  who is a pleasant sort of a man and what he says is very diverting he drinks composes and sings and he has good Skill in Sauces and Ragoo's and in a word he knows how to spend his time agreeably which makes many People desire his Company He had once stay'd with his Eminence in his Abbey of  Pontoise  where he had always People of his own choice at his Table He had formerly travelled to  Rome  with  Monsieur de Chaulnes▪  and he was as well known there to the Cardinals as was the Ambassador himself But he refused Cardinal  Bouillon  what he had granted the other and excused himself under pretence of some Affairs Whether what he pretended was true or not I cannot tell The Instruction of greatest Importance which his Eminence carried to  Rome  was concerning the Affairs of  Poland  where the question was who should be chosen King of that Kingdom Because  John Sobieshi  who had possessed that Throne since the Year died in He had left many Children by his Queen whom he had married before he was promoted to the Royal Dignity her MaidenName was  Francoise de Nation  Daughter of the Marquis  d' Arquyen  of whose Family there was once a Mareshal of  France  under the Name of  Montigny  Her Birth should have united her closely to the  French  Interests But Women resent the Affronts or the Refusals they meet with more highly than others do She had become an Enemy to the King long ago because  he would not grant her the favour she desired of him which was to make her Father Duke and Peer of  France  ever since which time she has done all was in her power against  France  and has not kept those measures that Prudence and Civility obliged her to insomuch that she caused some Insolencies to be done to the Marquis  de Vitrich  the King's Ambassador The King her Husband who tho' he was a man not only of as great Valour as any in the World but of great experience in War of which he gave sufficient Proof at his raising the Siege of  Vienna  when the Infidels besieged it  Ann  yet he was not a man of so much Prudence in other Actions of his Life For while he was upon the Throne he behaved himself rather like a private man than a Soveraign his chief care was to hoard up Money without taking any pains to make Creatures and Friends to himself and his Children He never considered how necessary these were for placing one of his Posterity upon the Throne after his Death or if he did consider this he has thought that they could always make themselves Friends by the Treasures which he should leave them And therefore he sold all the Palatinates that came to be void as well as every other thing with which the former Kings of  Poland  used to gratifie the Nobility and Gentry of that Kingdom These Practices had alienated the hearts of his Subjects from him as well those who had bought those Places as those who expected to have had them in Gift and without Money So that his Children were far from having any ground to hope that they should have the same good fortune that Three several Families who possessed this Crown successively had formerly had I mean the Families of  Mamcllus Jagellon  and  Palatin  whose Children so long as they had any succeeded to the Throne so that it did not pass into any other Family than their own  However the King having advice of all this thought to place a Prince of his own Blood upon that Throne who was a Subject and such a one too as the  Polanders  must always have to be their King For they are a People that soon despite their Prince unless he be a brave Man and capable to lead their Armies himself in Person without which qualification he has buy a melancholy Life among them  The last of the  Palatins  who enjoyed that Crown was an Instance of this And it's known that this people obliged him to apdicate so soon as they perceived that his Conduct did not answer to that of his Ancestors The Prince whom the King proposed was  Francis Lewis de Bourbon  Prince of  Conti  who in this War which his Majesty had maintained against the greater part of  Europe  has given such extraordinary Proofs of his Valour and Conduct that all the Army said openly that the very Spirit and Soul of the late Prince of  Conde  his Uncle who was one of the greatest Captains that ever  France  had was return'd to this World and had taken possession of the Prince of  Conti  's Body that he might save his King and his Country from the Confederacy that was formed against them I know that this way of expressing themselves was altogether extraordinary and new but as it was impossible for them to express more emphatically the just E  cem they had for that Prince as a singularly brave Man so this way of speaking passed so currant and was so often repeated that his Reputation for true Courage is established in forreign Countries as well as in  France  Though this Prince is not rich yet he sent Crowns of his own Money into  Poland  to gain the Suffrages of those who had already Inclinations for him only upon the Account of his great Fame For as this is the only time of Harvest with the great men of  Poland  so a Prince needs never pretend to their  Crown unless he will sow before hand that they may reap the Fruits of it The more that this Prince had of true merit the more was  Sobieski  's WidowQueen enraged against the King She entertain'd hopes to have her eldest Son Prince  James  chosen to succeed his Father and for this very end she had married him to a Sister of the Empress's and of the Queen of  Spain  's that he might have the Emperors Assistance But all the Assistance in the World being of no use in that Country unless it be supported with liberal Donatives and she being narrow and penurious that way as her Husband was The Prince of  Conti  would have soon carried it against Prince  James  had there been no other Competitors for it  The Queen of  Poland  finding that she could hardly succeed in her designs for her eldest Son endeavoured to perswade  Monsieur l' Abbee de Polignac  the French Ambassadour to alter his measures by offering that if he would recommend the Duke  de Vendome  to be chosen King instead of the Prince of  Conti  she would unite her friends with his upon condition that the Duke should marry her so soon as he was chosen At the same time she sent two of her Sons to  Paris  under pretence of travelling but her true designs was that they might be Spies at the French Court and might see if the King was in such a Condition to support the Prince of  Conti's  pretensions as the  Abbee de Polignac  pretended For it was reported in  Poland  and almost in all foreign Countries that  France  was drained both of Men and Money and that it was so far from being able for such an undertaking that it was upon the brink of ruin unless a peace was speedily concluded The  Abbee de Polignac  gave the King an account of the Queen of  Polands  Proposals but at the same time advised him not to trust her And assur'd him that she would rather make her  faction joyn with that of the House of  Austria  than with the Prince of  Conti's  For she had so far forgotten that she was a born Subject of  France  that she thought of nothing so much as how to embarass all his Majesty's Projects and Designs In the mean time the two Princes  Alexander  and  Constantine  younger Brothers of Prince  James  came into  France  And that they might make the French Court entertain a better Opinion of their Mother than i  did from the Account that the  Abbee de Polignac  had given of her they brought along with them near three Millions of Gold and put Eight hundred thousand Crowns of it into the TownHouse i e the Bank of  Paris  The Queen of  Poland  designed by this to let the world see she had not renounced  France  as the  Abbee de Polignac  had insinuated And that she was resolved to settle her two Sons in that Kingdom in case they could not  with Honour But besides that this  seemed for her interest she made also  strantage by that Gold which she had sent  for as to its fineneis it was much below the standard of the  French  Coyn yet it was taken into the Mint as if it had been the finest Gold in the world for the King stood so much in need of Money that he was content to take it as it was When these two Princes were come to  Paris  and to the Court they were soon convinced by the Luxury they saw in both these Places that the reports which had been industriously spread in  Poland  were altogether false They betook themselves to those diversions that Princes of their Age do usually entertain themselves with They went to all the Balls that they heard of and there was one thing besel them that deserves we should give an Account of it  Being at one of these Balls with Five or Six Gentlemen of their Retinue who were Masked as  well as themselves there was there one of the  Mousquetaires  of the Kings Houshold who had put on the habit of a Counsellor and was therewith Disguised He chanced to meet with the young Princes whom he did not know and told them very Gravely that it was to no purpose that they should put themselves to so much trouble in a business wherein they could not succeed and therefore as their Counsel he would seriously advise them to agree with their adversary otherways they would be cast in their suit The two Princes had received letters from  Poland  the day before wherein they had the bad News that the Queen their Mother despaired of succeeding in her designs and this News had spread through the Town so that they never reflected that this discourse was said Innocently and without any other design but that it might suit with the Garb he had then put on They Imagined on the other hand that he had spoken with relation to the news they had received and they were so enraged against him that they thought it not enough to call him Villain and Rogue and that he was but an insolent Rascal to behave himself with so little respect to them but they also Bastinad'd him Soundly The poor Counsellor finding that he had but a bad cause to plead for himself began to cry out What do this to me a  Mousquetaire  to me as those of the Company of  Mousquetaires  use to do when they find that they have to deal with too strong a party But the Princes of  Poland  pulling off their Masks that it might be known who they were there was not so much as one Person that would come to the assistance of the poor bastinado'd  Mousquetaire  He marched off with the blows he had received and resolved to complain to the King from whom he expected more Justice No doubt he had reason to demand it and would certainly have obtained it if he had had to do with those of hit own  Rank But the Princes were beforehand with him in complaining to his Majesty And he had the hard fortune to be sent to prison so soon as he offered to speak of it By this treatment and by what he had before met with he became sensible that it was not for his Interest to take up a Trade that he had no skill in and therefore he resolved never to profess it any more or if he did he would never give counsel but to those who asked it of him The one of these Princes was much handsomer than the other And the King was resolved to give them the blew Ribban  i e  to make them Knights of the  Holy Ghost  This was to do good for evil For the Queen their Mother never failed to do all that was in her Power to traverse his Majesty's Designs When they gave her Advice of this she sent an Express to them and told them that she was surprized to find that they had so much as listened to such a Proposal since they could not but know that if they accepted of it they should thereby act directly contrary to the Interests of their Family that they knew how a  she was engaged in the Interest of the House of  Austria  and that they must follow her Example in adhering closely to that House By this it is manifest that she had altogether forgotten her Native Country ever since she was put to it to keep up the Splendour of her Childrens Family by endeavouring to raise her Eldest Son to Royal Dignity These Princes having received these Orders from their Mother gave the King thanks for the Honour he had offered to do them but excused themselves for not accepting of it They frequented the Balls as formerly tho' they were sometimes engaged in other Business as particularly with the Marquis  de Coaquin  a Person of Quality in  Brittany  who had but a little before married one of the Marshal  de Noaille  's Daughters  This was no ill Match for him especially seeing the Mareshal was so much in favour The King had given him the Command of his Army in  Catalonia  though he was not a Man of so much Experience as many others for except that he had commanded some Troops in the time of Peace because he was first Captain of the Lifeguards all the Preferment he had come to was to be  Aide de Camp  to His Majesty But the King added yet another Honour to this and made him Mareshal of  France  in the Year though no body could see that he had done any great things to deserve such a Preferment However whether it be that His Majesty knows Peoples Merits better than others do or if Fortune which has favoured him in all his Undertakings designed to approve of his Choice this Mareshal gained very soon a considerable Battle He had formerly taken the Towns of  Roses  and  Gironne  and then it was said of him that though he had not done any thing to deserve the Mareshal's Staff when he first received it yet he had afterwards made it appear that he was worthy of it His Father who was one of Cardinal  Mazarin  's Creatures had been also a Captain of the Lifeguards and it was his Fortune to be raised to that Post when he was least expecting it It was in the King's Minority and the Occasion of it was this The Queen Mother had become jealous of the Count  de Termes  who was provided of the same Charge so that he was forced to remove from the King's Person at a time when it was his Turn to have waited upon him When he was dismissed she ordered that another Captain of the Guards should take his  Batton  but they had all promised to one another to do nothing to the Prejudice of their FellowOfficer for which the Count  de Charost  was banished and Monsieur  de Chandenier  was yet more unfortunate for the Queen took his Commission from him and gave  it to the Marshal  de Nouailles  's Father so that he was never able to recover it though he lived a long time after It was not for want of Time that he could not succeed nor was it for want of Conjunctures that seemed favourable enough for him for he was of the same Family that Madam  de Morte  pan  was of And since he was not more guilty than the Count  de Charost  who was soon recalled from his Banishment and made Duke and Peer of  France  it may be said that there is nothing in this World but good or bad Fortune For this Man was so far from being in a worse condition because of his Disobedience that he raised his Fortune to such a degree that he could not desire to raise it higher while the unfortunate Marquis  de Chandinier  was quite undone with his Fall  Tho' it be to the only late Duke  de Nouailles  that his Family owes the present Greatness to which it has arrived yet it must be confessed that it is an ancient and honourable Family I know that the present  Madame de Bouillon  when she was striving for the Door with the Dutchess  de Nouailles  spoke of her and her Family with so much Disdain that if her Word could have been taken for it the Family of  Nouailles  should have been thought a very despicable one I know also that she produced some old Papers by which it was found that one  Anthony de Nouailles  had been Steward of the House to the Viscount  de Turenne  but as Stewards of the House at that time were usually Gentlemen and as there are younger Brothers of good Families who are forced to condescend to meaner things than he did so that One Instance ought not to give us any mean Opinion of that Family which is certainly very noble and very ancient And it cannot to be said that the Marquis  de Coaquin  match'd below his Quality when he married a Daughter of it though it be true  that his Family has sometimes made greater Alliances For not to go far back his Mother was  Rohan Chabot  and his Grandmother  Orleans Longueville  He had a great Estate in  Brittany  which his Mother resigned in his favour as she did almost every thing she could claim by her MarriageContract and for her Dowry For this is a Lady of extraordinary Virtue and so soon as she had put her Affairs in order she resolved to retire into a Convent and reserved nothing to herself but Livres  per Ann  which was by very much less than what she had a Right to if she had exacted so much as she might have done Her Son was but Years old when he married  Madamoiselle de Nouailles  but he was as tall a Man as he could expect to be at and his Mother importuned him to take a Wife because he was the only Child his Father had left This Lady had not been very happy in her Marriage though she was of an agreeable Complexion and of a very good Air yet she had not so much Beauty as to please her Husband and since she knew by her own Experience what Disgusts Husbands use to take at their Wives when they are not altogether agreeable she ought at least to have chosen an handsome Lady for her Son that he might not fall into the same Immoralities that her Husband had done But this was what she had thought least of and she had soon reason to repent of it For upon the Morrow after the Marriage when some of her Sons Friends came to pay him their Compliments upon that Occasion he could not forbear telling them that they needed not give themselves that trouble that his Mother had chosen a Dwarf for him instead of a Wife That it seem'd she who was a devout Lady had made this Choice because the Duke  de Nouailles  was devout also But for his part he wish'd his Wife more so than either of them that he might not be troubled with lying  with her And that he was resolved henceforth to treat her as a Relique that is that he should never come near her but upon Holy Days From that day he gave such Proofs of his want of Affection to her that all the Family took notice of it They all consulted what was fit to be done in such a Case that  Monsieur de Coaquin  might not engage himself in those lewd Cour  es that Husbands use to betake themselves to when they come to despise their Wives The Archbishop of  Paris  who is the Mareshal's Brother was called among the first to give Advice in this matter And they all agreed that because the new married Lady was pale as Death which made her the more disagreeable to her Husband it was therefore necessary to find out some Expedient to give her a better Colour they had recourse to Painting which is highly esteem'd among the Ladies who by daubing their Faces with white and red make themselves look to be of as fine Complexions as they plea  e But many of the more scrupulous sort of People were surprised when they heard that so good a Man as this Prelate and so devout a Lady as the Dowager of  Nouailles  had advised such a thing as that But though the Archbishop of  Paris  and the Dutchess  de Nouailles  did not only cause this Lady's Face to be painted with white and red but also caused Shooes to be made for her with Heels that were a Quarter of an Ell high that she might thereby appear so much the  yet she was as unlovely in the Eyes of her Husband as she had been before nay he thought her the more ugly upon this very account insomuch that instead of conversing with her he entreated his Friends who spoke to him sometimes of her and of his Father in Law that if they would oblige him they would not so much as speak either ill or good of them In the mean time he endeavoured to comfort himself as well  as he could with good cheer and in the Company of some Ladies whom he visited not upon the account of any familiar converse but that he delighted to vex them and they were never more out of humour than when they saw him come into their Company so that they would gladly have gone out at the Window to shun any converse with him if they could have done it  The  Mareshal de Nouailles  who has had more than twenty Children by his Lady though she be not to this time much above forty years had as yet another daughter to marry there was a great difference between her and  Madam de Coaquin  The one was as agreeable as the other was deformed which made one say to the Marquis  de Coaquin  that the Mareshal had given him  Leah  but had kept  Rachel  There was abundance of young Gentlemen who were Suitors to this new  Rachel  both because her Father was much in favour at Court and because she herself was so great a Beauty The Count  d' Estrees  who came to be happier than the rest for it was he that married her was of the number of those who made their Addresses to her His Ambition carried him to this as much as any thing else He considered that though he was of a Family which is in the Possession of more Honours in the Person of his Father and his two Uncles than any other Family is yet that was nothing to him unless he could attain to the like Honours For tho' his Fathers elder Brother was Duke and Peer of  France  and that his Son had succeeded to him in the same Honours and though his Father was Mareshal of  France  and his Uncle a Cardinal yet he himself had no Place or Rank at Court and was only considered there as a Person of Quality as Ten Thousand others are So that he saw nothing that could satisfie his Ambition unless he went aboard of the Fleet where he would be obliged to signalize himself because he had the Survivance  of the Office of ViceAdmiral which his Father was in Possession of His Uncle the Cardinal who had a greater Kindness for him that for the Duke  d' Estrees  though he was his Nephew as well as he and by his elder Brother too ad+vised him to this Marriage and he used his ut+most Endeavours to bring it about as the only means whereby he might be made a Duke as his Cousin was And he was so earnest in this Affair that he sent Word to the Duke  de Nouailles  tha  if he could presume so much upon his favour a  to employ him to procure a Dukes Patent to his Nephew he should marry his Daughter without one Farthing of Portion And he promised also to make him his Heir and to make the Inheritance as good as he could The Duke  de Nouailles  who had not much Money to give with his Daughter and who had given no great Portion with  Madame de Ceaquin  though he had made a shew of con+tracting for  Franks  but it was in Cats are Rats  to  that is he had given him a Regiment and some other lesser Preserments the Duke I say was not so rich but that he had  to be  and sparing of his Money and he was well  with the Proposal but he was  to be  ond of it And  to him  in the  had better  to that Honour upon the a  Fathers great Services  had with the King but  to marry his Daugh+ter  he had to  was true he had more  others to carry on such  he was Captain of the  him an easie Access to the King's Person but that was not enough for a matter o  so great Importance and therefore he ought no  to trust to it so much but that besides marrying his Daughter he should take all the same measures he would do if he were to marry another But it was very difficult for the Count  d' Estrees  to take those measures because the Mareshal would not give him so much Money as was necessary to put his Affairs in a good Condition For want of this they resolved upon all hands to deal with one  Madame de Thoist  a rich Lady she was the Widow of a  Maîere de Comptes  and she had lent a considerable Sum to the  Cardinal d' Estrees  and was not payed of it And besides she was a Friend of the Duke and Dutchess  de Nouailles  and because she had no Children they told her so often that she ought to adopt  Madamoiselle de Nouailles  for her Daughter that though they could not prevail with her to leave her all her Estate yet they perswaded her to do something for her And she offered at last to give her what the Cardinal  d' Estrees  owed her But becau  e they would have more the matter is put off to this time for she will not give away all her Estate in her own Lifetime yet she promises that besides the Sum which the Cardinal owes her which she is willing to part with presently she shall also consider this young Lady in her Will so that she shall be sure of something more at her Death That which sell out between the Princes of  Poland  and the Marquis  de Coaquin  was not at all for his Advantage if we may believe what is commonly reported In the mean time they took their Journey to return into their own Country after they had been magnificently regaled by many Persons that belonged to the Court  Monsieur de Langlee  who is none of the least considerable of them if we consider nothing but his expensive way of living was the first who gave them a splendid Entertainment and acquitted himself very handsomly in it He is now in possession of being the first who regales Strangers of  great Quality upon their arrival Which made the King say some time ago  i e  before the arrival of the two Princes that  Monsieur Langlee  seemed to be made for no other end but to entertain all the strangers that came to Court But he entertains Persons of Quality who are of the French Nation as Magnificently as he does strangers There is not a Man about the Court that regales our Princes and Princesses so often as he does and he has got into a Custom of providing a Collation for the  Dauphin  as often as he comes to the Opera It is but of late that he was in a condition to acquit himself well in such an undertaking for though his Father who was once but a poor man and of mean extract made up some small estate to him yet it was far from being sufficient for such costly Entertainments He has raised his Estate by gaming which has put him in a condition to build so many fine Houses and by which he has so great yearly Revenues And considering the first years of his gaming and now that he is become rich it may be said of him what was once said to the President  Bellievre  by one that designed to flatter him I confess that the beginning of this Discourse would be insipid but that it is agreeable to the first beginnings of his fortune and that the last part of it would be impertinent but that it suits with his present Circumstances  This President who was the chief Man in the Parliament of  Paris  had always some Debate with  Cardinal Mazarin  whom he did not much Esteem and it may be the  Cardinal  had as little Esteem for him and perhaps he was in the right too However the Man I just now spoke of knowing what Opinion this Chief President had of his Eminence said to him once whilst they were speaking of him that no great Account was to be made of such Men whose fortunes were volatile and what show soever they made yet they were  but like glaring meteors which disappear'd in a short time But on the other hand he said that the Presidents fortune was built upon a rock and that he must be a Man of very little sense who did not see a great difference between the one and the other We may easily perceive that the Man who spoke so was best acquainted with old customs since he magnified a chief President so much and undervalued a chief Minister And at most it is only during a Kings minority that this way of reasoning will hold good But now a days he should be accounted a Madman or one that had returned from the other world that would speak at such a rate In a word if  Monsieur de Langlees  fortune might have been compared to a Meteor while his high spending was  ounded only upon what he gained at game yet he has now settled it upon so many fair Buildings in  Paris  and in the Country that we may say what the Man said to the President that he had now founded it upon a Rock  Madame la Marquise de Bethunes  who is the Queen of  Polands  Sister gave also a Magnificent Entertainment to the two Princes her Nephews There were many Persons of Quality of both Sexes at this feast and it ended with a splendid Ball Yet this Marchioness is not at all rich nay she's very poor to be sister of a Queen yet it was her own fault that she had not a better estate For when her husband was Ambassadour in  Poland  the Queen her Sister was resolved to make her rich But she became jealous that the Queen was in love with her husband and that it was for his sake that she made so kind Offers Her jealousie made her commit a thousand follies which so displeased that Court that her Husband dying there all that she brought to  France  from that Country was a gift of a hundred thousand Crowns which the Late King of  Poland  gave her upon the Estate of the Late Duke  de Longueville  This Monarch had lent this Money while he  was but great  Mareshal  of  Poland  and when the Duke  de Longueville  was aspiring to that Crown But his Sister the  Dutchess de Nemours  refused to pay it as well as all the other sums which he had borrowed at that time that he might attain to Royal dignity She pretended that her brother was under age when he borrowed these sums and therefore she was not obliged to pay them This gave occasion to a Law suit before the Council and it appeared intricate and doubtful For the Law forbids to lend Money to Minors unless it be manifestly for their advantage and therefore  Sobiesky  ought to lose his Money because the Duke was not of age when he borrowed it But the  Marchioness de Bethunes  as well as the Dukes other Creditors answered to this that what might be considered in the case of ordinary Loans ought not to be considered in such an extraordinary case as this was when the borrower of the Money designed to employ it for obtaining a Crown and that this had been always the Opinion of the Prince of  Condee  who while he was alive was still desirous that  Monsieur l' Abbee d' Orleans  who was Brother and heir to the deceased Duke  de Longueville  should pay punctually the full interest of all the Money that had been Borrowed upon that Account That it was he who took care of all the Affairs of the Family of  Longueville  because  L' Abbe d' Orleans  who was the Duke's elder Brother was but a weak Man and unfit for Business That their Sister the Dutchess  de Nemours  dared not to have spoken any thing against the payment of those debts so long as her Brother was alive But now that he was dead and that the Prince of  Condee  who had always supported the Claim of the Creditors was dead also she who loved Cavils and litigious debates had brought them to the Trouble and Expence of a Law Suit It was first debated before the Parliament of  Paris  but at last it was brought before  the Kings Council Either because the affair was of importance or that it ought in course of Law to have been carried thither And it was truly the Kings Interest to take cognisance of it himself especially at such a Juncture as that was for it was his concern to gain the Polanders to the Prince of  Conti's  Interest and not to give them cause to complain that they were cheated by the Duke  de Longueville  who had borrowed Money of  Sobiesky  and of several other Persons of Quality among them Therefore the King Ordered the  Marquis de Barbesieux  to consider the case and to report it fully in his Presence For the Secretaries of his Majesty's Commands of which this  Marquis  is one are also Counsellors of state and have the same Commissions so that the King may Charge them with all sorts of business as he can do any of the rest of that number But after some days his Majesty considered that so young a man as the  Marquis de Barbesieux  was scarcely capable of an affair of such importance and that an old and experienced Counsellor of state would be much fitter for it He therefore took it out of the  Marquis  's hands and Committed it to  Monsieur de Ribere  But  Madame de Nemours's  Council had found so many shifts that this has been put off from time to time and is not as yet determined Yet it is believed that she will be cast in it as she was in another Law  uit which she had against the Prince of  Conti  before the  Requetes du Palais  This case was of yet greater importance than the former and there were some Circumstances in it that were very considerable and therefore I shall give a full Account of it  Monsieur l' Abbe d' Orleans  whom I just now mentioned having renounced his right of Primogeniture in favour of the  Comte de St Paul  his younger Brother who thereafter took the Title of  Duke  de Longueville  he was in a short time restored to all his rights by the Death of that Prince who like a fool was the Occasion of his own Death as he was passing the  Rhine Monsieur l Abbee  was willing to have made over the whole Estate to his Uncle the Prince of  Condee  but this Prince who enjoyed eighteen hundred thousand Livres of yearly revenue thought that he had already more than was sufficient to make him happy if Riches alone can make us so and therefore he advised him to give it to his Mother  Madame de Longueville  who had more need of it than he The  Abbee  was a man that did every thing he was advised to especially if the Advice came from a Person of Authority like the Prince  de Condee  so that he agreed that those who managed his affairs should draw up his will and that he should sign it It was done as the Prince of  Condee  was pleased to order it and the  Abbee  altered not so much as one word in it By this will he gave over the Principality of  Neufchatel  in  Suitzerland  with some other possessions to his Mother the Dutchess  de Longueville  during her Life But after her Death the Prince of  Condee  had Right to them by the same will if no new will should be made But he who had already refused them was resolved not to make any advantage of the  Abbees  will for the future and therefore he caused his right to be made over to the Prince of  Conti  after the Death of the Dutchess The Prince of  Conti  had need of a good Estate for his Fathers Marriage was disadvantageous for his Fortune as well as for his Honour He had resigned the  Abbacy  of  St Denis  with many other good benefices for the sake of a Niece of Cardinal  Mazarins  who was truely a Virtuous Lady but her Uncle gave her nothing in Marriage though he had so pillaged  France  that he might have given her a great Estate without pinching himself in the least Yet he had promised him Mountains of Gold as he always used to do when he had a design to cozen  any body but having dealt by her and her Husband as he usually did by all those with whom he had any business though he might at least have put some difference between him and others both upon the Account of his Quality and because his Niece was Married to him This Prince died very poor for a Person of his Rank However The Dutchess  de Nemours  being informed of the Will which her Brother had made importuned him so as that she prevailed with him after the Prince of  Condees  Death to make it void and to make another will by which he left the whole Inheritance to her Now this  Abbee  dying soon after and the Prince of  Conti  pretending that the will which had been made in his favour ought to prevail against this Last will the  Requetes du Palais  were the proper Judges in the first point of the controversie The Reasons of his plea were that  Monsieur l' Abbee d' Orleans  was  non Compos  when he made the Last will so that it ought to be considered as if such a thing had never been done If  Madame de Nemours  had been well advised she would have said the same of him when he made his first will and she would have had no difficulty in proving it so that the first being no better than the second she should have succeeded by law to the whole Estate without any sentence in her favour because she was his sister But her Council it seems was as Visionary as those who live beyond the  Alps  who plead for the Popes Infallibility They maintain'd that the Testator was sound in his Judgment when he made the second will whereby the first was made void And they had no other way to prove this but by the Popes Infallibility who had put him into Priests orders at the very time that he made this second will And they alledged that it could not be supposed that the Pope would have ordained him Priest if he had not been in his right wits And they thought this so good a Reason that they could not conceive  how it could have been answered So that they neglected all other reasons and adhered only to this one to support their Cause The Prince of  Conti  desired he might be allowed to prove that the  Abbee  was  nonCompos  when he made his last Will which he offered to do by Evidences that could not be excepted against He was allowed to prove it and he produced his Evidences upon whose Deposition the whole Cause depended The Question was if  Monsieur l' Abbee d'Orleans  was sound in his Judgment when he made his second Will But there was no great diffi  ulty to resolve this Question for there were Evidences that told things of him that could not have been said of any Man but one that was fit for a Bedlam And among other things they deposed that when he was going to say Mass the first time after he was ordained Priest he stopped when he came near to the Rails which usually separates the Sanctuary and the Altar from the  Neve  of the Church and there he tried if he could jump over the Rails with his Feet close together They deposed al    hat when he found he was not able to do it he came back about Pac  that he might give himself more Force by running and in this mann  the Holy Sacrifice unto God Almighty a  d  g  ve a Thousand other Proofs of his being a Fool an Account of which wou'd be too tedious  Madam de Nemour's  Council were aston shed when they heard the Evidences depose such things as these and they wished then that they had not relied so much upon the Popes Infallibility and that they had taken better measures but it was now too late The Judges proceeded to pronounce a Sentence by which that Prince the  Abbee  was declared to have been  non compos  when he made his second Will  Although the City of  Paris  and all the Court were overjoyed when they heard that the Prince of  Conti  whom they lov'd so dearly had gain'd his  Cause yet  Madame de Nemours  appealed to the  Grand Chambre  where she is still prosecuting it but no body doubts but that the Sentence which was pronounced will be confirmed by a Decree Some time before this Sentence was pronounced  Madame de Nemours  acted her part very dexterously and like a Lady of good Conduct She knew that she had a strong Party to deal with in her Lawsuit and therefore as her Brother's Heiress she had given the Principality of  Neufchatel  to the  Chevalier de Soissons  a Bastard Son of the late Count  de Soissons  who was a Prince of the Blood and her Uncle For she was the Daughter of one of his Sisters who was married to the Duke  de Longueville  her Father and after whose Death he married the Prince of  Condee  's Sister Now when she gave this Principality to this  Chevalier  she had obliged him to marry the Marshal  de Luxenbourg  's Daughter hoping that the need the Kingdom had of the Services of so great a Captain in so formidable a War as it had to maintain against so many Enemies would give her an Interest with the King sufficient to balance the Prince of  Conti  's But this Marshal died to his Daughter's great Loss before that the Sentence which I have given an account of was pronounced So that the Hopes vanished which  Madame de Nemours  had comforted herself with when she contrived that Marriage Though it must be confessed she took very good measures to bring about her Designs But there was something in it that was still worse for the  Chevalier de Soissons  for he had resigned a good Abbacy that he might marry a Lady who was neither rich nor handsome and he had also taken the Title of Prince of  Neuf  hatel  when he was upon the point of losing the Principality  Though the gaining of this Cause was for the Prince of  Conti  's Advantage yet it was nothing in comparison of the Crown of  Poland  which perhaps  the King had obliged him to think of more than he would have done had he followed his own Inclinations For he was become passionately in love with a Lady of great Quality Insomuch that tho' a Crown be so considerable as that it deserves to be preferred to all other things yet he seem'd not to to be too much concerned with it lest he should have been obliged to quit his Mistress But it was quite otherwise with  Madame  the Princess of  Conti  the thing in the World she wished most was that her Husband might be a King Ambition which is natural to Persons of her Rank and Quality made her passionately desirous of this but besides she hoped that the Crown of  Poland  would take off her Husband from the Affection he had for the other Lady which yet she durst not complain of for fear of displeasing him and for some other Reasons that must not be published However this Design for the Crown of  Poland  met with great Opposition and as the House of  Austria  was mindful of its own Concerns in the present Juncture of the Affairs of  Europe  that it might by all means procure that Crown to one who would closely adhere to its Interests So the Prince of  Conti  was not the only Person that was in Competition for it with Prince  James  Prince  Lewis  of  Baden  General of the Imperial Forces and whose Merits were not much short of his own was also one of the Competitors and King  William  seemed to favour his Pretentions against Prince  James  but this was only a sort of Phantome which was brought forth upon the Theatre to frighten the Actors while his Imperial Majesty had resolved underhand in his Cabinetcouncil to cause the Elector of  Saxony  to be chosen who for some Years past had been closely in his Interests and commanded his Forces in  Hungary  This Elector was a man of true Courage as well as the Prince of  Conti  and Prince  Lewis  of  Baden  so that the  Polanders  could not refuse him upon that Score For they are People who will not have a King but one that is capable both by Courage and Conduct to head their Armies in Person when it comes to fighting But the great difficulty that they had to remove was that he was a  Lutheran  and this seem'd a very great one because among the many Laws that the  Polanders  have made for the Government of their Kingdom they have established this for an unalterable one that no Man shall be chosen King of  Poland  but he who is of the  Roman  Communion And therefore when the Emperor communicated his Designs to the Elector of  Saxony  of advancing him to the Throne of that Kingdom he insinuated to him at the same time that there was a necessity for him to change his Religion At last whether it was that he had but little Religion as ordinarily the Great Men of the World have but a small share of it or if it may be imputed to any other cause I do not know but he not only agreed to do what was desired of him but he also abjured it privately before the Bishop of  Javarin  yet he did not this till he saw that there was a Party in  Poland  formed for him which was capable to put the Crown on his Head The Designs of this Party were kept so secret that  Monsieur L' Abbee de Polignac  had not the least notice of them but continued to believe that he had no body to grapple with but Prince  James  whom he was not much afraid of because of his disobliging Conduct And the People were generally of Opinion that he would follow his Example in too many things So that  Monsieur L' Abbee  wrote to the  French  Court that he hoped in a short time to bring the whole matter to an happy Issue The Bishop of  Cujavia  whom the whole House of  Austria  did chiefly rely on for making its Designs effectual being afraid that he should not be successful because all the People had so great an  Esteem for the Prince of  Conti  and especially the Ladies who all desired him for their King thought it best to deal craftily in this matter and to manage it to the best advantage he could for himself when he found that he was at the Head of a Faction that at least might make the  French  Embassadour jealous of him tho' it was not as yet so strong as his own He caused it to be told him underhand that if he desired that he might not cross his Designs it was in his Power to hinder him from doing it That he knew he aspired to be a Cardinal and that he considered that the only way how he could attain to that Dignity was by his being successful in his Negotiations for the Prince of  Conti  But if he would renounce all Pretentions in his favour he would joyn Interests and unite Factions with him by which means the Crown of  Poland  would be infallibly secured to that Prince No good Subject would have refused what this Bishop desired though perhaps no Man would have yielded to it but with some Reluctancy But  Monfieur L'Abbee  scorned to hearken to such a Proposal and did not so much as communicate it to the  French  Court but pursued his former Designs while the Bishop strengthned his Faction by bringing over into it the Party that had been for Prince  James  for his Mother the Queen of  Poland  was so enraged against the  French  because they had traversed all her Designs for her Son that she had rather the  Polanders  should chuse any other Man than the Prince of  Conti  so little did she remember the Place of her Birth or that the King of  France  had been so instrumental as he was in the Election of the late King her Husband Yet among all the Factions that were among the Palatinates there was one thing in which they all agreed that what Person soever they should chuse for King he should purchase their Suffrages with good round Summs of Money so that the Crowns which the Prince of  Conti  had sent  into that Country was but as a drop of Oyl in a grea  Fire but the King supplied his Indigence and sent thither at one time and another of Crowns The Elector of  Saxony  borrowed Money with both Hands from several Princes that he might satisfie the covetous Desires of the  Polanders  and King  William  lent him great Sums as well as the Elector of  Brandenburg  In the mean while this Prince made some of his Troops march toward the Confines of the Duke of  Saxony  's Dominions that lie nearest to  Poland  as if there had been some Difference between them and the Elector of  Saxony  took Occasion from that to carry his own Troops out of  Hungary  under pretence to defend his Dominions against the Duke of  Brandenburg  But all this marching of Troops on both sides was only that they might join their Forces together in case of need that is in case there should be a double Election as there was great appearance of it that so the Duke of  Saxony  might make good his Election by Force of Arms  While these things were doing the Prince of  Conti  diverted himself the best way he could as if he had not in the least been concerned in any Business of Importance He spoke of buying a House at  Berci  as the Dukes  de Chaulnes  and  de Gesvres  had done for each of them had one in that Town The Duke  d'Elbeuf  who has that in common with many other Persons of Quality that he does not always speak truth hearing him speak of a particular House that belonged to one of the Farmers of the King's Revenues whose Name waswith which he said he was very well pleased offered immediately to deal effectually with the Landlord and that the Prince should have a good Bargain on't And that he might believe that he could perswade the Farmer to do any thing he told the Prince that if he pleas'd to sup in that House to morrow night he would oblige the Master of the House to provide a Supper for him and then he should have an Opportunity to see the  whole Contrivance and all the Conveniencies of the House The Prince of  Conti  was well pleased with the Proposal and told him that he was engag'd to be with the Dutchess  de Bouillon  at that time but he would rather disengage himself than miss such an Opportunity So they made an Appointment at that House to morrow in the Evening But while the Prince of  Conti  was at Dinner the Duke  d'Elbeuf  sent to tell him that the Appointment could not be kept because the Landlord who was not accustomed to entertain Princes of the Blood in his House was con  ounded with the Thoughts of it as for himself he was resolved to take the Advantage of that Disappointment and that if the Prince was pleased to put off the Appointment till to morrow he would do himself the honour to entertain him at dinner in the same House with Seven or Eight of his Friends such as he should chuse The Prince of  Conti  said to the Man who brought him this Message that he thank'd the Duke  d'Elbeuf  for it and that he accepted of it and would be timely at the House to morrow that he might have time to take a full View of it and consider it He invited the Marquis  de Coastin  the President  de Mesmes Monsieur Caumartin  and some other Persons of Quality to go along with him but on the Morrow's morning came another from the Duke to make an Apology that he could not wait upon him as he had promised because of some Business of Importance that had unexpectedly fallen out and which he was obliged to look after But there was not so much as one Word of all this true He did not so much as know the Man to whom the House belonged he had not given him any Notice of the Appointment which the Prince and he had made to sup at his House nor had he any design himself to entertain him at dinner in the same House so that there were as many Lies as Words in all that he had said to him upon that Head The Prince of  Conti  made a Jest  of all this with his Friends without troubling himself any more about it There was one Mr  Chapelle  who had been formerly one of the Prince's Domesticks but at this time a Farmer of the Revenues hearing one speak of it to Mr  Caumartin  went to his old Master and told him that though he was far below the Duke  d'Elbeuf  's Quality yet he should acquit himself better of his Promise than he had done in giving him an Entertainment at that very House provided the Prince would not take it amiss that he had presumed to invite him to it The Prince answered that he was well satisfied with it and made a new Appointment with his Friends to be there to morrow in the Evening and Mr  Chapelle  regaled him splendidly There were at this Entertainment many Persons of Quality both of Civil and Military Employments and among the rest there were present those whom the Prince had invited when he was to have supped there upon the Duke  d'Elbeuf  's Invitation They discoursed about a great many things and as it was impossible they could forget the Duke so they took occasion to speak of a Visit that his Mistress had lately paid to the Archbishop of  Paris  because he had made an Ordinance wherein this Lady found herself concerned There were many Persons who had taken advantage of his Predecessors easie Temper and had obtained leave of him to have Chappels in their own Houses and under pretence of hearing Mass in these private Chappels they came so seldom to Church that they scarcely heard Mass there at the Four great Festivals of the Year Now the Archbishop thought it necessary to remedy this Custom and for that end he suppressed all those Licenses that his Predecessors had granted and ordained that all those who desired to have the Benefit of them for the time to come should appear before him that he might examine the reasons upon which the Licenses had been granted The Dukes Mistress  had got one of these Licences and she paid a visit to the Archbishop and intreated him to confirm what his predecessor had done But this Prelat having heard of her Lewdness and Licentious way of Living which was so publick that even her son had made no scruple sometime before to say to the King when he asked him if he would be ready in a short time to go to the Army that he could not be so soon in a readiness to go thither because his Mother had been more concerned to get ready the Duke  d'Elbeufs  Equipage than his This Prelat I say who knew all this and a Thousand other ill things of her answered her coldly that those who would wo  ship God acceptably must fi  st know him and fear him and that those who did know him and fear him would always think their pains well bestowed when they went to Church where the rest of his s  rvants use to serve and worship him and without saving any more to her he refused to Grant her requests The Prince of  Conti  and all the Company Commended the Archbishop for having spoken to her after this manner for tho it was but a word or two that he had said yet it was Enough to make her reflect of her own ill Conduct The most part of them said also that the Duke  d'Elbeuf  was much in the wrong to deal so unkindly as he did by his own Lady for the sake of an old antiquated Whore who had the Impudence sometimes to boast of the fineness of her Complexion when it was well enough known that it was Entirely owing to painting But there were some who undertook to justify the Duke though they could not justify this Lady his Mistress They pleaded in his behalf that since he had nothing to Live by or to support his Character except his Government he could not be much blamed for having a Kindness for a Lady that rewarded him so Liberally as she did That she was frequently giving him good sums and therefore he dispensed with her age That there were several others who would do the  same thing if they were in his circumstances and in a word it was an ordinary thing among the young Beaus of the Court  This was not the only Lady whom they had put on the foot of paying them well In the mean time it had been always the fate of King  Charles  the d who had been mightily in love with this Lady to have Mistresses who fought only to enrich themselves at his expence and with his spoils to enrich others before his face Another Dutchess whom this Prince had Lov'd before this had used him the very same way as this did and the  Chevalier de Chalillon  who is known at present in the world under the name of Marquis had continued to render her good service as long as she had wherewithal to recompence him and she thought she employ'd her Money very well because he was handsome and very well shap'd and besides he was always ready when she had a Mind for him For she was a woman that gave no quarter to her Lovers and pay'd them only in proportion to their services She had learn'd from a Lady that was her friend and who had Learned it herself from an old  Countess de Vertus  that things ought to be done in this manner and at least that this was the practise of the old Countess her self who passed amongst the women of her time for the Cunningest that was among them all The world indeed had accus'd her of weakness of judgment but they had done her the greatest injustice that can be done to a Woman since so far from being a Fool as was Pretended she had made it appear by one of the Principal Actions of her Life that never any Lady had better understanding for being grown old and yet the prick of the flesh continuing to torment her she took the Method that any honest Woman ought to take which was to find out a Husband for herself tho she was quite decrepid In the mean time knowing by the experience that she had of the world that she might come to be deceiv'd unless she took all the precaution  that prudence could possibly suggest she did two things which shew the greatness of her Judgment One was to cast her Eyes on a Man whose figure promised fairly The other was to make a bargain with him to oblige him to his good behaviour This Man was the  Chevalier de la Porte  who after the same manner as the  Chevalier de Châtillon  is now from  Chevalier  come to be a  Comte  He was of a good Family and tho he was not come of the Dukes of  Br  tagne  as her first Husband was yet she could put him in his place without being accus  d of making a mean Alliance So being satisfy'd both of his Person and of his Birth the Question was only how to secure herself against the disgusts which a Husband usually takes especially when interest has oblig'd him to take the burthen of an old Carcass which he never marries but in the view and hope of being quickly rid of it A Woman of so much knowledg and Experience was not easily to be deceiv'd and behold too what Measures she took to avoid it After she had express'd the tender Sentiments she had for him by which he reckon'd himself extremely Honored because he had nothing and she was very Rich then she shewed him a strong box in which there was Fifty Thousand Crowns of ready Money Having opened it too that he might be the more fully assured of what was in it and having let him look on it as long as was enough to make him in love with it she told him that here was what she intended to give him on Condition that when he was her Husband he should use her kindly The  Chevalier de la Porte  who knew as well as any Man alive how to make Promises swore to her Mountains and wonders to perswade her that if ever she did him that favour he had rather dye a Thousand Deaths than ever to be guilty of Ingratitude It seems he thought she would trust to his Swearing But the Countess retaining still her former sentiments told him that tho' she believed him a Man  of Honour and in that Quality that he would keep his word to her nevertheless that she would take such Precautions with him that she should have no reason ever to repent of that a Husband very often laught at the Promises which he made to his Wife that she had no Mind to be disappointed and therefore had resolved to tell him once for all that if he would have her Thousand Crowns he must merit them by using her obligingly that the best thing a Husband can do to a Wife is to caress her frequently that on her part she promised to give him ten  Louis d'ors  for every time he caressed her and as often and as far as he erred his performances he might reckon to be payed accordingly At this rate if he caressed her but three times a Night there was thirty  Louis d'ors  sure for him in the Morning but if he pushed his valor further he might quickly make the strong Box pass from her Closet into his own This clause and Condition was not very agreeable to the  Chevalier  tho on other occasions he had been often at work without being so well Rewarded But having a Passion for this Money he consented to gain it with the sweat of his Brow The Lady married him privately and keeping her word to him every Morning in Proportion to his services he had quickly emptied the strong box if the Lady's Children had not perceived the intrigue betwixt them They spoke to her of it as a thing that made the world talk strangely of her conduct and the Lady finding herself straitned in this point told them at last that they were unjust to suspect her of Lewdness that she did nothing but what was Lawful for her to do that she was Married to the  Chevalier  and that she would lye with him as often as ever she pleased Her Children knowing that she had ready Money and that this was the high way to squander it endeavoured to get the Marrige annulled on pretext that her great Age for she was at least Seventy and two had made her Incapable to know what she was doing The Affair being brought  before the Judges the Advocates pleaded on both sides these for the Children alledged strongly what they had been told that the Lady was moap'd and silly and that the  Chevalier  had surpriz'd and impos'd on her Weakness but the Advocates on the other side having utterly run down this Pretext by producing the Bargain which she had made with the  Chevalier  and which she had given him fairly in Writing the Children had certainly lost their Cause but the Judges would not suffer the  Chevalier  whose Desire to empty the strong Box had brought him almost on his last Legs already to go on to kill himself  They considered likewise that the Lady by this means would ruin her Children for if this Coffer were once emptied she would sell all that she had rather than fail to fill it again in order to entertain the good Services which the  Chevalier  had not fail'd to perform very constantly So the Marriage was annull'd by Decree of Parliament who nevertheless appointed the  Chevalier  to have Crowns for the Reward of his Labour  The King of  England  's Mistresses us'd him much after the same manner and made him pay as dear for his Pleasures as this old Lady paid to the  Chevalier  especially she to whom this little History was told and whom the  Marquis de Châtillon  did so drain of her Acquisitions that she is now as poor and miserable as once she was opulent As for the other whom the Duke  d'Elbeuf  frequented she managed it a little better though in the mean time she stuck at no Expense or Reward when he threatned to leave her and go and push his Fortune elsewhere  But let us now pass to some other Subject We must know then that she who was Lady of Honour to  Madam la Dutchesse  being resolved to retire from Court her Place which is worth Crowns of Pension  per Ann  was sought for by a great many  Ladies of Quality who besides the Crowns which they had in their View considered also that thereby they should have Opportunities to get into His Majesty's Favour for he desires to have one always about  Madam la Dutchesse  who will give him an exact Account of all that she does And it is of for that reason that he has appointed these sorts of Ladies of Honour both for her and the other Princesses of the Blood and that he himself has settled pensions upon them And he has a politick design in it for thereby he keeps both them and their Husbands in their Duty because they know that they have one in their House who takes notice of every thing they do so that they dare not adventure upon any thing that may in the least displease the King The Marchioness  de la Porte  whose Husband was once Admiral of a Squadron and Nephew of the  Comte de la Porte  whom I spoke of just now having but a small Estate to live by thought that it would be very convenient for her to have that Post especially she having been a Widow for several Years She had several Friends and among others the Marquis  d' Angeau  who has some Interest at Court and did his utmost to have carried the Place for her He was once in a fair way to have succeeded in it but that it was told the King that this Lady was not of sufficient Quality for so honourable an Employment yet no body adventured to speak any thing against her Conduct for though she be no great Beauty yet she is of so great Virtue that she's as much esteemed as those who are much more beautiful And the late  Monsieur de Croissy  was once afraid that his Son who is now Secretary of State should be so taken with this Lady's true Merit as to make a secret Marriage with her and therefore he sent him into  Italy  where he made him stay some Years and did not recal him till he thought it probable that his long Absence had cured him of the Wounds which his Converse with her had given him  But her Enemies made use of another Argument against her to which had she got but a fair hearing she could have so satisfied the King that no doubt she would have obtained her Desire But they imposed upon His Majesty and told him that there were Two Families of  la Porte  in  France  that the one of them was a good Family and the other was naught that she was of the last and  Monsieur de Mazarine  was of the first and if he should prefer her to be Lady of Honour to  Madame la Dutchesse  People of the lowest Rank might pretend to Advancement as well as she And by this means they prevailed so far as that she was excluded and the Marchioness  de l' Angle  was preferred to that Place Though in the mean time she could have justly pleaded that her Husband was of as good a Family as the Marquis  de la Porte  for the  Marquis  was of  la Porte de Vesins  and Monsieur  de Mazarin  was of another  la Porte  At least this was said when the Mareshal  de la Milleray  who was the Marquis's Father had made his Fortune under the Ministry of Cardinal  Richelien  with whom he was first Cousins It is true there were some who then alledged that his Father the Advocate  la Porte  was not descended of the Family  de la Porte de Vessins  though he pretended to be of it and the Marquis  de Vesins  was not well pleased with his Pretences insomuch that he would have challenged him for taking the Coat of Arms that belongs to his Family but that he was so afraid of the Cardinal's Greatness that he spoke nothing of it unless it was to some particular Friends to whom he would sometimes say by way of Jest that those who advised him to enter into a Lawsuit with the Mareshal upon that account gave him bad Counsel that he did not see how it could be pretended that the Mareshal had done him any Dishonour by entring himself a Descendant of his Family that on the contrary he look'd upon it as an evidence that the Mareshal considered  his Family as better than many others for which he was much obliged to him  This was not the first time the King had been imposed upon on such Occasions The late Marquis  de Renel  had some Enemies at Court who insinuated to His Majesty that he was but of a very late Family so that though he was a Person of great Merit yet the King who has great Considerations for Birth look'd upon him as one of those whom he ought not to advance so soon as others for there are People of certain Names and Ranks who have some Right to hope that they shall not languish so long as others do in the meer Expectation of the Favours which his Majesty uses to bestow upon his Subjects However this Marquis having a great Desire to be Lieutenant General of the King's Armies and thinking that he ought to have been preferred sooner he took occasion to speak of it one day to the King and fairly represented to him what good Services he had done him The King gave him a favourable Hearing as he always uses to do to those who address to him though few of them have the Honour to be known to him But when his Majesty was pleased to answer him the Marquis was surprised to hear him say that he was in the wrong to be so impatient and that he believed he had done as much for him as for any Man of his Rank That every Man ought to do him so much Justice as not to think he was forgotten or neglected though Persons of great Quality were preferred to him That it was true that Merit ought to be rewarded wherever it was found and that he had always had a special Regard to it ever since he had governed by himself but that there were certain Families which he thought fit to prefer to others for they had been always in possession of the most honourable Offices and the highest Preferments both at Court and in the Army and that he could not without Injustice deprive  their Children of them unless he found that they had degenerated from the Virtue of their Ancestors The  Marquis  soon perceived by this Discourse that his Majesty had been possessed with a mean opinion of his Birth But he was so far from cont adicting what his Majesty had said in favour of those who had been of honourable Families that he told him it was for that very reason that he thought himself neglected that though he was not a Duke and Peer or had not so much as any Office of the Crown yet he was of as good a Family as the most part of those who had been advanced to higher Posts That his Ancestors had had the Honour to do good Services to his Majesty's Royal Ancestors and that so long as he followed their Example he did not see why he was not capable of any of those Offices that are designed for Persons of the best Quality If the  Marquis  was surprised at His Majesty's Discourse the King was no less surprised at his He had always thought that the  Marquis  was one of those upstart  Marquises  of whom there are so many at  Paris  and especially of Citizens who take upon them this Title though the Foundations of it were laid only in their Fathers Coffers or in some Offices of the Gown which some of their Family has enjoyed And being desirous to be fully informed in this matter he asked him if it was not true that had been told him that he was only  de la Noblesse Bourgeoise i e  one who derived his Pedigree only from rich Citizens or from those who had enjoyed Offices of the Long Robe as was said of the late Archbishop o  Paris  When I speak after this manner it is in Imitation of the Bishop of  Noyon  For that Prel  te who is the Glory of Prelates yet not in the  in which he ought to be it▪ but only beca  e he thinks that no Man is comparable to him for the Quality of his Ancestors and speaking one day of the Family of that Archbishop he said that it  could not be called an Honourable Family but only one of the best of those Families that have been raised by Lawyers or that had made a Figure among the Citizens of  Paris  What he said was true upon the matter for there is a great difference between a Family that is truly honourable and such a Family as he was speaking of but sometimes all the Truth should not be told especially if there is a great man who may take it amiss for some days after the Chief President of the Parliament who is descended of the same Family that the late Archbishop was of made the Bishop of  Noyon  sensible of his Folly The Bishop being come to dine with him and his Coachman having carried home his Coach Horses resolving to return with them in the Afternoon the Chief President who had been informed of what he had said of his Family and who is seldom upon the Reserve with any man especially if he have any Quarrel against him no sooner saw him but he gave orders to the Steward of his House not to serve up dinner till he was gone The Bishop staid till the ordinary time of Dinner was past and long'd for it but seeing no appearance of it he asked the President if that was one of his Fasting Days he told him plainly that it was not but that he had given Orders that no Dinner should be served up till he was gone because it would be too great Presumption in him and a Token that he had forgotten the meanness of his Birth which was but of the  Noblesse Burgeoise  if he should offer to entertain at his Table so great a  Seig  e  r  and one of such an illustrious Descent as he was of to this he added some other Words to the same Purpose and the Bishop was puzzled what to say to him but after some dull Apologies he was forced to go home and dine at his own House yet he would fain have staid dinner with the President because his Coach Horses were not there but the President chose to let him have the use of his Coach rather than he should have staid dinner at his House  But to return to the Marquis  de Renel  he said to the King that he knew no such thing in his Family as  la Noblesse Burgeoise  that every one of his Ancestors wore a Sword by his Side and if there were any of the Family that had not done it it was because he was consecrated to the Church as was the Cardinal  d' Amboise  who had the Honour to be the first Minister of the Crown When he spoke of this Cardinal the King perceived that he had been imposed upon by those who had made him believe that the Marquis was but of a late Family and of mean Extract So that afterwards he did him Justice and gave him what he had asked  The Duke  de Choiseul  who had discorded with his Lady was reconciled to her after his Return from  Savoy  She could hardly be prevailed with to live with her Husband and though she was fully as much to blame as he was for the Breach that was betwixt them yet she pretended that it was not safe for her to live with him But the King told her that she had but one of two Things to chuse either to cohabit with her Husband or to go into a Nunnery The very Thoughts of a Nunnery is enough to fright a Lady especially when she has any Inclinations to be a  Coquette  so that the very speaking of it was enough to oblige her to obey his Majesty's Commands But the King's Care extended farther than to those Ladies who did not live as they ought to do with their Husbands he took care also to curb the Extravagancies of many others even though they did not belong to the Court and being informed that  Monsieur l' Abbee Lionne  the Son of the late  Monsieur Lionne  Minister and Secretary of State and who enjoyed the Abbacy of  Marmoutier  with a great many other rich Benefices did not behave himself so well as his Character obliged him to do he sent him a Letter  de Cachett  ordering him to retire into a Seminary He also appointed one to stay with  him and to take care that when any Benefices that were at his Gift became vacant he should neither diminish the Revenues of them nor bestow them upon unworthy Persons  Monsieur l' Abbee Roullier  whose Father had made so great an Estate by the Post Office that he settled all his Children as if they had been Persons of some Quality was also sent to the Seminary of  Notre Dame de Vertus  with an Order to those that had the Inspection of him that they should not allow him to correspond with any Person and that they shou'd oblige him to do Pennance for all this was necessary to reduce him to a right sense of his Duty seeing he had become a Rake and led such a profligate Life that he equally disgraced the Character of an  Abbee  with which he had been honoured and that of a Magistrate with which he was also cloathed for he was Counsellor Clerk of the Parliament of  Paris  But he had so little Regard to what became the Dignity of those two Places that there was not a greater  Debauche  in all the City But notwithstanding all the Care his Majesty took to repress Immoralities and to oblige all Persons to live suitably to their Characters yet the Generality of them were so far from answering that Design that there were greater Abuses committed than ever For where there was one that was thereby prevailed upon to abandon his former vices there were Thousands who thought it enough if they were so far Hypocrites as to please his Majesty by an outward Appearance so that Hypocrisie began then to come in fashion and there were never so many  Tartuffes  or Hypocritical Puritans as began to appear at that time among People of all Ranks especially among the Courtiers though one would think that such a Character did less become them than any others For it seems to be peculiar to the Court that though Dissimulation may be Learned there better  than in any other Place yet it is a diffimulation of a quite other kind than what I am now speaking of For when a Courtier dissembles he does it that he may procure to himself as many Pleasures and Conveniences as he can and to shun Troubles and Inconveniences and not to be his own Tormentor and Executioner as the Hypocrites who makes himself miserable in this world as well as the next so that it is an ordinary saying that an  Hypocrite is tho Devils Martyr  Those who had new Opinions to Publish could not have found a time more Convenient for their Purpose than this was There was a certain sect which had lain hid under the Ashes ever since  Molinos  had Adventured to broach his wild sentiments at  Rome  and it began now to appear again at  Versailles  The Archbishop of  Cambray  who was  Preceptor  to the young Princes of  France  and had the reputation of a very devout Man declared himself zealous for this Sect Those who were of it did teach by a subtil kind of reasoning tho' to speak the truth they did not avow it plainly that the Body might do all sorts of wickedness while in the mean time the Soul might be altogether Innocent and unconcerned as to what the Body did for if the Intention of the Soul was directed to God and for his Glory then it was not in the least to be blamed for the ill that the Body did which is under a strange captivity to the corruption that is in mans nature There was one  Madame Guyon  a Lady of no great Quality but of so great an Estate that she had Married her Daughter to the  Comte de Vaul  Eldest Son of  Monsieur Fouquet  who had already endeavoured to Propagate this abominable Doctrin for which reason she had been sent to  Vincennes  But the Archbishop of  Cambray  undertaking to defend her Publickly he Published a Book in which by an abstract way of Reasoning which no Body was capable to comprehend he endeavoured to show that this Doctrine was not in the least erroneous He alledged the Writings of  St  Francis de Sales  to justifie himself and pretended that he taught nothing but what had been formerly taught by that Holy Man Every Body was astonished at the sight of this Book and it had never been Printed if the Author had been obliged to ask a licence for it But the Bishops have a Privilege to Publish what Books they Please though their works be not Examined by those who are Authorised to give Licenses for Printing Books And this piece was published before it was known that he had begun to write it All the Hypocrites were overjoyed that a way was found out for them to gratifie their sensual appetites while they outwardly appeared vertuous which they thought themselves obliged to do lest they should lose the Kings Favour But they were not suffered long to boast of this Imaginary victory For as soon as this Book appeared the Archbishop of  Paris  The Bishops of  Meaux  and  Chartres  with many other Prelats declared against it and the Bishop of  Meaux  began immediately to write a refutation of it and besides he joyned with the Archbishop of Paris and the Bishop of  Chartres  both which had a great Interest at Court to deal earnestly with his Majesty that the young Princes the  Dauphins  Sons might not be kept any longer under the Direction of a Prelat whom they accused of the most horrible Impieties that had ever appeared in the Church  The King knew not well what to say to this because he had always looked upon the Archbishop of  Cambray  as a Man of good Morals and of Exemplary Piety And it must be confessed that there was never any Prelat appeared more zealous for Gods Glory for he was so far from having ever given any bad Example that on the Contrary he had been very useful for the Edification of those who saw him or conversed with him However the Archbishop of  Paris  and those other two Bishops gave his Majesty no rest till they had obtained what they  desired and what they thought necessary to be done upon such an occasion and they prevailed with him at last to order the Archbishop of  Cambray  to retire to his own Palace till fa  ther orders But before he came there he had occasion to Practise the Doctrin which he had undertaken to defend it is commonly called Quietism the meaning of which is that a Man ought never to be troubled at any thing that can happen to him Now the Archbishops Palace had taken fire by the fault of some Servants whom he kept there and it had consumed not only all the Buildings but also all the Furniture of the House which had been very richly Furnished Every Body desired to know how he would take this accident but he appeared still as firm and unconcerned as if he had been altogether disinterrested Mean while many Persons of Quality were suspected of the same Errors that were charged upon him and among others the Duke  de B  a  villiers  and his Brother in Law the Duke  de Chevreuse  The first was Governour to the young Princes of  France  whose  Preceptor  the Archbishop of  Cambray  had been and the thoughts of this were uneasie to the King till he was satisfyed in it by the Duke himself the King discoursed with him a long time in his Closet upon this Subject upon which he had likewise a long conference with the Duke  de Chevreuse  after which it appeared that his Maiesty was undeceived both as to the one and the other yet their Ladies who had always been of the Number of those who went to  Marli  did not go there to often as they had used to do before that time which made some People believe that the King Dissembled a little in his Carriage to them The Archbishop of  Cambray  wrote in his own Vindication and pretended that all that he had said in that Book was true and orthodox and offered to submit himself to the Court of  Rome  while the Bishop of  Meaux  accused him of Heresie more than ever The  Abbee de la Trape  who had  some years before Renounced the Quality of an  Abbee  that he might compleat his Penance which he had been long under in the Quality of a simple Monk Declared himself also Mr  de Cambrays  Enemy without waiting till his Holiness should Pronounce any thing concerning his Book tho this Archbishop had sent it to  Rome  that he might know his thoughts of it The  Abbee  wrote two Letters upon this Subject which the Bishop of  Meaux  caused to be Published in the beginning of his own Book he thought by this to strengthen his cause and that since he had to do with an Archbishop who was a Man of Learning and had many Friends he ought not to neglect any thing that could in the least support him in it He also sent his Nephew  Monsieur l' Abbee Bossuet  to  Rome  that he might there employ all his Interest to have the Archbishop condemned at which many good People were offended for they thought that when a Man acted only through Zeal it was not fit to create him so much trouble  Madame Guyon  who by the Interest her Friends had made for her was set at Liberty fell into another Enthusiastick Fit in favour of this Sect she propagated it every where and infected the House of St  Cir  with it so that it was found necessary to put some of the Nuns of that House into other Convents In a Word the King took all the Measures that Prudence could suggest to him to crush these Errors before they should do any harm to the Church While he was at so much pains to prevent the ill Consequences of this Debate there were other debates broke out in the Churches of  Rheims  and  Roan  The Archbishop of this last City had made a List of some Books which he had recommended to those of his Diocese to be made use of for resolving cases of Conscience but had not mentioned any of those Books which the Jesuits think fittest for that purpose these good Fathers took this so ill that some of them appeared in Print against him the Archbishop  accused one of their Number as the Author he pretended to know his Stile and demanded of the society of Jesuits that they would do him Justice in punishing this Author The Fathers denied that he was the Man and he denied it himself and they sent him to  Paris  that he might withdraw himself from the Effects of the Archbishops anger who was doing all the mischief he could against him as well as against all the rest of that Society He made an exact search after the Printer of the Pamphlet that had been Published against him and having kept some of them in Prison for some time the whole business vanished into smoke for want of evidences The Schism that broke out in the Church of  Rheims  was also Occasioned by a debate between the Archbishop and the Jesuits These had publickly maintained in the Schools of the Colledge which they have in that City two things that the Bishop was not Pleased with The first was That the Doctrine which  Molina  taught concerning Grace had been virtuous in all the attacks that its Enemies had made against it The Archbishop of  Rheims  who is no  Molinist  censured these  Theses  as full of Falshoods and published an Edict declaring that they did not contain the true Doctrine of the Church he therein also censured some other Passages which they had cited in another  Thesis  and this Edict being conceived in Terms that they were very much dissatisfied with they did much the same that those of  Roan  had done They wrote against it and exposed it So that the Archbishop to oblige them to do him Justice was advised to cause the Provincial and the Three Rectors of their Houses at  Paris  to be cited that they might declare if this Pamphlet which had been Printed in that City had been done by their Order or without their order The Author had been more circumspect than to put his Name to it  and the Bookseller and Printer had concealed their Names But the Author had said enough to let the World know that he had composed it by Order of his Superiours and it was upon that account that the Archbishop would oblige the Provincial and the Three Rectors to make their Declaration After they had met in a Chapter upon this Business they were so foolish as to declare that the Pamphlet contained nothing but what was consonant to Truth and what they were ready to defend So that having made this Confession the Archbishop of  Rheims  gave in his Address to the Parliament desiring that Judgment might pass against them and that they might be obliged to make a publick Reparation of the Injury they had done him in publishing so scandalous things against him In this Address he said that if they pretended as it seem'd they did that they had been injured by his Edict then the Laws and Customs of the Church taught them that there were but Two ways by which they could have Redress The one was to have made it known to himself by representing to him wherein he had injured them But if they thought that he would be too partial in his own Cause and would not retract what he had once done how unjust soever it might be to them then the other way was to have addressed themselves to the Primate He represents also that it was not becoming private Men to expose the Conduct of an Archbishop by seditious Pamphlets That such a thing might be of dangerous Consequence besides that it was a Breach of Charity The thing which had given occasion to all this was capable to have revived the great Dispute concerning Grace which had made so much noise in the beginning of this Age and therefore the King thought it necessary to put a stop to this LawSuit and told Father  de la Chaise  that it was his Royal Pleasure that the Society of Jesuites should give Satisfaction  to the Archbishop of  Rheims  and having called the Chief President of the Parliament to  Versailles  that he might give him such Orders as he judged necessary about this Affair He took up I know not how much time in discoursing with him of the best Methods for putting an end to it The Jesuites who had made a foolish Step in justifying every thing that was in the Pamphlet were very glad that the King had fallen upon a way how they might evite the Shame and Disgrace which would have infallibly come upon them if the Parliament had proceeded to pronounce a Sentence They went to the Chief President and told him they were ready to obey the King's Orders the President told them he was glad they were come to a Resolution that was so much for their Interest as well as reasonable in it self He concerted the whole matter with them that they should draw up a Writing by which they should acknowledge that they had taken wrong measures in not addressing to the Archbishop himself as they ought to have done that he might have been pleased to have heard them in their own Vindication and promising that they should take that method for the future if ever they should be so unfortunate as to have occasion to complain of him And that in this Writing they should intreat the Archbishop to pardon what was past and to receive them and their Society again into his favour The President communicated this Writing to the King before it was signed that he might know how his Majesty was satisfied with it The Archbishop could not demand any more so that he was content to put an end to the Debate provided they should sign that Paper Perhaps they would not haye done it if the King had not interposed his Authority but the good learned Fathers knew better than others did that Scripture commands us expresly to obey superiour Powers and therefore it was no hard matter  to perswade them to do what the Archbishop had demanded of them  About the same time that the Archbishop of  Cambray  's Opinions of which I have already given some Account made so much Noise the Princess  d' Harcourt  was obliged to go to  Normandy  where her Husband's Estate lies to look after his private Affairs She had been long at Court and had always found a way to preserve her Interest in it in all the Changes that fell out though there were many others that were fully of as good sense as she who were not able to do so much So soon as she was gone from it it was reported that it was partly upon her account that the Archbishop had been cast out of favour And many were of opinion that she was a  Quietist  and so much the rather because she retired so often sometimes into one Convent sometimes into another But a Lady who thought she knew her better than others did said to those who were speaking of her that they were mistaken as to that Princess and that she was not for creating trouble to herself by an indiscreet Zeal and that she could be Surety for her that till the King as well as his Ministers became  Quietists  she should not be one But if they should declare them  elves once in favour of that Party she would not then promise for her for never Lady was more inclined than she to perform exactly what was enjoined by St  Peter to obey every Ordinance of Man whether the King as supreme or those who are in Authority under him  Those who were concerned in this Lady and had been under some fears that the Reports of her being  Quietist  might be true were well satisfied with this Account of her Soon after she returned from  Normandy  and was not behind with any Lady at Court in exclaiming against  Quietism  and spoke upon all occasions of no less than Fire and Faggot for those of that Perswasion  About this time the Chief President's Son was made a Counsellor of State in the Place of  Monsieur Pussort  who at last had paid that Tribute which all men owe to Nature after he had been Two or Three Years without being able to go to the Counsel of which he was Dean He was Uncle to the late  Monsieur Colbert  Minister and Secretary of State and he was as his Righthand to him when he was contriving ways and means for enriching the King at his SubjectCost For he had laid down some Maxims of his own by which he determined always in favour of the Exchequer And it was never seen that he had been so much as in one single Instance prevailed with even by the strongest Arguments to determine otherwise So that in the Council he got the Name of  Pussort  the  Fiscal  And when any man was so unhappy as to have a Lawsuit with the King he had reason to give over his Cause for lost if it depended upon his Vote But at last when he found himself at the point of Death he began to reflect that he must give an account of all these things the Thoughts of them put him under great fears His Confessor endeavoured to encourage him by representing to him the Mercies of God who pardons all the Sins a man has been guilty of so soon as he comes to repent of them The Archbishop of  Roan  who was his Grand Nephew and to whom he had left some part of his Estate as he did to all these who were within the same degrees of Kindred to him nay and to the Marquis  de Seignelai  's Children too tho' they were farther removed than the rest I say the Archbishop spoke much to the same purpose to him that the Confessor had done But the poor man was still afraid that he did it only as thinking thereby to comply with his Humour And he was the more confirmed in this when he observed that the Archbishop when he had gone into the Withdrawingroom to bring the  Viaticum  chided the Parson of St  Roche  that he had not caused him to be put in  his Bed instead of exciting him who was a dying man to pay that Respect and Veneration to that God in whose presence he then was However in a short time he was called to give an account of all his Actions before God's Tribunal and his Heirs had Crowns of Estate which he left them to divide among themselves And there was not so much as one of them had any use for his House to dwell in and therefore they sold it to  Monsieur Bertin  Treasurer of the casual Revenues who is a man of the greatest Curiosity of any in  Paris  in the matter of Houshold Furniture And as those at Court entertain the King with accounts of every thing that falls out so it was told his Majesty that Mr  Bertin  had bought the House and that when he came to dwell in it it would look quite another thing than it did while Mr  Pussort  was alive They told him also that he had the finest Carpets in the World better than any that were in his Majesties Palace The King had the Curiosity to go and see them and he ask'd him how much they had cost him and where he had bought them He answered that he had paid Crowns for the Piece of them at the Auction of the Marquis  de Segnelai  's Furniture The King said before all the Court that that Minister had always dealt so by him so that when any fine thing was brought from the  Indies  he gave him the Refuse and took all the best to himself And he added that he had never known a more vainglorious man than that Marquis or one that was so conceited of his own Personage that his Vanity had made him oftimes fail in point of good Breeding and in the Respect he ow'd him for without considering that he was speaking to his King he would have ask'd him sometimes if he did not think he was well dress'd and if he had not a good Air Mr  Bertin  finding that the King had a desire for the Carpets intreated his Majesty to accept of them  from him the King took them but would not have them in a Gift but caused him to be paid the Money that he had given for them There were Three Ladies who had been Friends of Mr  Pussort  that expected he would have considered them in his Will And for that end had complied for several Years with all his Humours they had every Night entertained him with Diversions suitable to his own Fancy and he had never given them so much as a Cup of Water for a reward except Two Meals that he gave them a Year The one of them was Marchioness  de Merce  who was his Wife's Niece and the other Two Persons I shall not name but they had fully as great a Desire to have their shares of his Money as she had But they were quite frustrated in their Hopes as well as she There were a great many who made Interest for his Place of Counsellor of State as well as for his other Place of Counsellor of the Council of the Royal Revenues by which he had Livers of Sallary But the King gave this last to  Monsieur de Pommere    and the other to the Chief President's Son as I have already said He had been Attorney General before but because he had made no great Figure in that Post his Father addressed to the King that he would be pleased to bestow this upon him and frankly told his Majesty that his reason was because his Son was not sufficiently qualified for being Attorney General that when he purchased that Office for him he believed that he had been capable of discharging it but he found he had been in a mistake and that therefore he would be glad to have him eased of the Honour of that Burthen which he was not capable to bear This was thought an odd sort of a Compliment from such a man as the Chief President of the Parliament And those who heard of it ask'd one another if it was necessary that a man that was of the Parliament should be of greater Parts than he who  is of the Council where the nicest Affairs of the Kingdom are treated of For it could not be said that it was the want of Memory or the Art of speaking in publick that made him incapable of the Office of Attorney General for while  Monsieur Talon  had been in that Post he had shown a way how to supply those defects he had always read his Pleadings and as it was no shame to imitate a man who as all  France  confessed had acquitted himself honourably in that Office therefore they concluded that certainly his Father knew of something else that made him incapable of it However the Father's Merits supplied all the Son's Imperfections insomuch that the King not only granted his Request but another favour also which he had not ask'd For he allow'd him to sell the Office of Attorney General to the best Advantage Upon which there were a great many offered for it who were as incapable of it as the President's Son was and who had much more Money than Merit They considered also that as the Incapacity of his Son had been the Cause of his being promoted to be a Counsellor of State so they might at last come to some Promotion for the same reason Among the rest there was a Master of Requests who was the Son of another Master of Requests and he concluded that this was the only way how he could raise himself to the greatest Offices of the Council And therefore he offered Money for it as others did and believed that he ought to have been prefer'd to them because he excell'd them in the Art of pronouncing ill and stuttering in his Speech and had lately married a young Girl which had made him be much considered But the Chief President made an ill step in Politicks for whereas he ought to have chosen one of the meanest Qualifications that he might thereby let the World see that his Son was not the only Person that was incapable of that Em Employment  The Man he bargained with was  Monsieur Joli de Fleuri  whose Father had been Counsellor of the Great Chamber He got Four Hundred Thousand Franks for it which was more by Franks than is usually given for such an office Then People began to say of this New Attorney General that it seemed he had no mind to be Raised to the Office of a Counsellor of State in that way that the Presidents Son had been Raised to it For so soon as he was Instal'd in his Office he made it appear by his Eloquence and his great Capacity that he was far above the Ordinary sort of Attorneys  While these things were a doing among the Lawyers the Duke  de Lausun  who has been so tossed by Fortune ever since he first appeared upon the stage of the World was very diligent in a Law suit he had against his Ladies family When he was near Sixty Years of Age he had Married a Daughter of the Mareshal  de Lorges  who was not above Sixteen In which he Play'd the Fool as much as when he put in for the Command of the Army in  Ireland  For it's Equally ridiculous for a Man of Sixty to Marry a Girl of Sixteen and for one that has never had any Command but over his own Domesticks or Day Lobourers to Command an Army Yet as good sense would qualifie him for the one much more than for the other so he managed his Wife in such a way that he never became one of those Husbands whose wives make them to be Pointed at in the streets he gave her as many fine Cloaths as she Pleased and as much Money as was Needful for her diversions But it was upon Condition that she should not keep Company but with some old Dotards of whom he was not much affraid For as to the young Sparks about the Court she was discharged in any terms to see them or to admit of any visits from them For by his own Experience he knew the Frailty of young Ladies All these Precautions were the more justificable because if it was in his Power to Secure this  young Lady for himself alone she was well worth all the Pains he would be at in doing it And he left nothing undone that was Necessary for that End The Governess whom he appointed to wait upon her was well Advanced in years she had once been with  Madame de Guise  and he trusted much to her Virtue she was as seldom from her as was possible for her to be and it was a rare thing to see this young Lady without her Guardian She had great advantages secured to her by her Marriage Contract without which the Mareshal  de Lorges  would not have given her in Marriage to him But the Mareshal and his Lady had not given him any portion with her yet  Fremout  who had ammassed many Millions of Money by farming the Kings Revenues which had been his Imployment almost fifty year supplied the want of a Portion for in the Marriage Contract he had Engaged to Leave them a Hundred Thousand Crowns after his Death and when he died sometime after the Duke  de Lausune  was surprised that his Son  Mr D'Onneuil  and the Mareshalls Lady who was his Daughter had renounced all Interest in the Estate and had brought from  Languedoc  a Little Girl of Eleven Years of Age who called herself his Relation and Pleaded she should be his heiress by the benefit of his Inventory His Widow had also Renounced yet before she did it she had Concurred with his Children to put the best and most Valuable things out of the way Upon this the Duke found himself under a Necessity either to Content himself with any Effects that he found still Remaining of the Inheritance or to Enter into a Law Suit against the Widow and her Son For as to his Father in Law and Mother in Law he could not ask anything of them For they had not signed the Grant which his Ladies Grandfather had made in Prospect of the Marriage Besides that they adhered to that Grant which he had made to themselves when they were Married together so that he had not any Reason  Imaginable to sue them at Law But he su'd the Mother and the Son and pretended that they had secret Conveyed out of the way the Effects of the Estate and that they ought to be Ordered to pay him an Hundred Thousand Crowns in Ready Money without putting him to the pairs of seeking for Payment out of such Remains of the Estate as did still appear But this was not all he Craved of them For besides this Crowns for which  Fremon  had payed Interest so long as he Lived as of a thing that was already acquired he had promised them a Hundred Thousand Franks out of the whole Estate but his Widdow and her Son had adjusted matters so that all that was Remaining of the Estate after the Debts were Payed was but at most Crowns so that they Designed to have frustrated the Duke of Franks besides that they would have left him in hazard of being called to an Account by the King and his Ministers as ordinarly all those are who Marry the Daughters or Grand Daughters of Farmers of his Majesties Revenues Unless the Marriage Portion has been Payed in Ready Money The Duke  de Lausun  who had no great Skill to Dispute his Ground in  Ireland  chose rather to quit it in time than to Expose himself to the dangers that Threatned him if he had Stayed to Dispute it with Sword in hand thought he could better understand the Debates of the  Pallais  and tho' he had no more Served an Apprentiship in this than he had done in the war yet he Armed himself with a strong Resolution to plead to the utmost rather than Do what Monsieur  d'Onneuil  would have obliged him to The case was Brought before the  Requetes du Palais  because of the Quality of the Parties who had the Right of  Committimus  for Mr  D'Omneuil  was Master of Requests besides that the Duke was not obliged to appear before any other Court of that kind unless he had Pleased to do it He was enraged above what can be Expressed at the Methods  that were taken by  Madame de Fremont  and  Mr D'Onneuil  in which they had engaged the  Mareshal de Lorges  and his Lady and therefore he enjoyned the Dutchess that she should not see either of them this did very much trouble this Lady as well as her Mother the Mareshals Lady who Loved her Daughter tenderly but the Duke told his own Lady That when he Enjoyned her this It was not so much for satisfying his own resentment of the Injuries they had done him as because her Interest was Concern'd in the debate For he could not expect to Live Long and after his Death she could not expect any thing of his Estate but what was provided to her by the Marriage Contract and therefore It was Necessary he should use all sorts of Means for Preserving to her what she ought to have from him That if she had nothing but what they now offered her the Effects they would give her would be liable to a Chamber of Justice whenever it should please the King to erect one and that they might even make him pay a Tax by the first Order of Council that should be given in that matter And that therefore she ought to make her Mother sensible that there wa  not any hopes of a Reconciliation with her unless she should oblige her Brother and  Madame de Fremont  to do him Justice These words made a great Impression upon the Dutchess mind and as it is Natural for very Body to desire Riches even to the Prejudice of a near friend so she observed her Husband  Commands so Exactly that she refused to be present at the Ceremony when one of her Sisters was to put on the Nuns habit and to Enter into a Convent at  Conflaus  till her Husband told her that he was satisfyed she should go thither  About this time  Monsieur de Phelypeaux  the only Son of  Monsieur de Pontehartrain  Minister and Secretary of State Married his Lady Who was a Daughter of a Sister of his Fathers who had been Married to the  Counte de Roye  of the Family of  Rochefocant  He had gone to pay her a Visit and the Marriage was Concluded within three Days after The Bride had but Livers of Portion and the King gave her Livers of Pension of which she had before which the King had granted her when she Embraced the Roman Communion For her Father had Dyed a Protestant in England where he rather chose to End his Days out of his Countrey and deprived of the Honours which he might have Expected upon Account of his Birth and Merits than to Renounce his Religion The Countess  de Roye  was also in that Kingdom and had Carried thither three of her Children that she might Educate them in their Fathers Religion while the Rest of them which were many chose Rather to Embrace the Roman Religion this Lady whom Mr  Phelypeaux  Married was in a Convent at  Soissons  when her Marrige was Concluded And her Relations having sent a Coach for her and having appointed Changes of fresh Horses by the way that she might come in all hast she came to the Countess  de Roucy  Lodgings who was her Eldest Brothers Lady Monsieur  de Phelypeaux  pay'd her a visit there that very day and he returned upon the morrow and dined with her The  Chevalier de Roye  who was this young Ladies Brother was at dinner with them and finding that  Monsieur de Phylipeaux  had caused a great many pieces of Clothe of Gold and Silver to be brought to him that he might chuse what Pleased him best he said to the Countess  de Rocy  that if she did well she would take him off a Vest of one of the pieces of that was sold for Louis  D'Ors  the Ell Madame de  Roucy  was not over hasty in doing it and the young Bride having Chosen what Pleased her best The Mercer went home before the Chevalier  de Roye  had his desire But after he was gone the Chevalier fell a Jesting with Madame  de Roucy  and said it was a mean thing in her to have let the Mercer go away with the Brocado stufs before she had done what he desired of  her that it was the least she could have done for the Honour of her Sisters marriage  Monsieur de Phelipeaux  seemed not to take any Notice of what he said but so soon as he was gone home he sent Orders to that Mercer that the next morning he should wait upon the  Chevalier de Roy  by the time he had got up with that piece of Stuff and that he should let him have as much of it as he desired the Mercer obeyed his Orders and made his Compliments to the  Chevalier  and told him the Commission he had got The  Chevalier  finding he might take what he pleased of the whole Piece took not only as much as would be a Vest but as much more as would line him a Coat The Marriage was solemnized within two Days after and the King gave only Crowns to  Monsieur de Phelypeaux  though he used to make a Present of Franks to the Son of one of his Ministers of State upon Occasion of his Marriage But he told  Monsieur Pontchartrain  that he was not so liberal as he used to be and that the then Juncture of Affairs was the Cause of it For the War forced him against his Will to be a good Husband of his Money but that the present Loss should be made up to them another time  Monsieur Pontchartrain  was a man of too great sense not to take this Compliment as he ought to do And being very glad to have a Daughter in Law of so good Quality he had the Satisfaction to hear every body approve of the choice he had made for his Son He certainly quite outdid all that the former Ministers of State had done for raising their Families and those of whom his Daughter in law was descended were far more illustrious than the Families of the  Souvrees  or the  Alegres  or the  Matignons  with whom  Tellier  and the  Colberts  had marched and the Family of  Crussol  of which the  Marquis de Barbesieux  's first Lady was a Daughter was far short of them though it was honoured with the Title of Duke and Peer of  France  Next morning after this marriage  there was  Loüis d'Ors  put under the young married Lady's  Toilette  Which was but a small Sum for a Lady of her Quality there being ordinarily a greater Present made to a  Partizans  Daughter But the Evening before she had got a Present of a little Box with a great many fine Toys in it and she found in the Bottom of it a little Box full of Ear rings and Jewels  Every Body went and paid Visits to the new married Couple and the Dutchess  de Lausun  having gone to pay her Compliments she saw her Mothers Lacqueys in the Antichamber by which she knew that she was there And being unwilling to be found in Company with her least she should ostend her Husband she went out of the Room designing to go home though she had already caused notice to be given that she was there This was told to  Madame de Phelypeaux  and to  Madame de Pontchartrain  who was then in company with her and who sent to call back the Dutchess and went and spoke to her and brought her into a Closet and put her in company with her Mother The Dutchess was once in hopes to have been married to  Monsieur Phelypeaux  and his Mother  Madame de Pontchartrain  would have been extremely glad that she had been her Daughter in Law But the Duke  de Lausun  making his Addresses to her at the same time the Mareshal  de Lorges  who knew that the Duke was worth Livers a Year loved rather to see his Daughter a Dutchess than Daughter in Law to a Minister of State This had made some Misunderstandings for some time between  Madame de Pontchartrain  and the Mareshal's Lady but they were reconciled by this Marriage and she was the first that told the Dutchess that she ought to live in a better Correspondence than she did with her Mother The Mareshal's Lady told her the same and charged her with Ingratitude since she knew well enough how tenderly she  ad always loved her The Dutchess told  her that if she pleased she might easily remove the Cause which she had to complain of her That she wished for nothing more than to see her frequently and to live in good Terms with her and that it was very unpleasant to her to be deprived of that Happiness But she was obliged to obey her Husband and it was in her Mothers Power to cause Justice to be done him and then all difficulties would be removed that besides if she loved her as much as she said she did she would cause ready money to to be paid to the Duke and her that what they got might be exempted from those after Enquiries to which the Estates of Farmers of the Kings Revenues are lyable The Mareshal's Lady having no Inclination to do any such thing or perhaps being afraid that the doing it might discover all the Effects which had been conveyed out of the way that her Mother Brother and herself might be secured from such an Enquiry answered her that she demanded what was impossible for her to grant That she could not expect more than what she could have out of her Grandfathers Estate and that to ask more was a Proof that she considered her own Interest rather than what was reasonable The Dutchess replied that notwithstanding all she said yet the Duke her Husband believed that he did not demand any thing but what was reasonable but since she and her Friends were all of another Opinion and he was positive in his Resolutions it was not likely they would soon agree that for herself she was extremely vexed at it because she found herself deprived of all that sweet Converse she might have with her Parents without any hopes of a Reconciliation because she knew her Husband to be of such an humour that it was almost impossible to dissuade him from any thing that he had resolved upon And he was certainly as headstrong as a SheMule when he had got any thing once in his Head and instead of being softned by the Account the Duchess  gave him of her Mothers Grief because she and they were not good Friends he was more incensed against them than before And he not only prosecuted his Lawsuit but petitioned the Council that he might be allowed to bring it before other Judges pretending that he having accused  Madame de Fremont  and her Son for having intermeddled with the Estate of the deceased they ought to plead their Cause before the Court of  Aides  and not before the  Requetes du Palais  by which we may perceive that while he endeavoured to secure himself against an Enquiry he endeavoured to expose his Lady's Grand mother and her Uncle to one This enraged them more than ever against him especially because it was their Interest that the World should not know that  Monsi  ur Fremont  was so rich as he truly was when he died For it is a Crime for those who farm the Revenues to die so rich and their Heirs are ordinarily called to account for it They had a Thousand Instances of this in other People and though they had not had any yet they had lately had an In  ance that concerned them nearly and which no doubt put them under great Apprehensions  One who had been a Deputy or Clerk to Mr  Fremont  was dissatisfied with him perhaps because he had n  t considered him in his Will or it may be because he had not made any great Fortune while he was in his Service However he came to  Monsr Pentchartrain  and informed him that he knew a certain place where his deceased Master had hid  of Money that he himself had assisted in putting it there so that he spoke nothing but what he knew to be certainly true He was so positive in what he had said that it was impossible for    Pentchartrain  o  to believe him and therefore he sent Orders to the Intendant at  Roan  to go to the place where this Deputy had told him the Money was hid which was in a Cellar of a Castle which  Fremont  had bought in  Normandy  This Dep  went  nither also by order of the same Minister  that he might point out the very Place where it was hid But when the Intendant had gone thither and made as exact a Search as was possible for him there was nothing found The Deputy thought to have excused himself by saying it had been taken away since the time that he had put it there But as no Man should think to deal thus by a Minister of State for they would be every day imposed upon if those who offered to do it were not punished for it He was sent to Prison and no doubt he deserved it though he had not been guilty of any thing but of designing to ruin the Family of that Man by whom he had acquired all the Estate he had however the Duke  de Laus  n  pretending that if it was not in that place that  Madame de Fremont  and her Son had hid her Husband's and his Father's Treasures yet as he pleaded before the Council the Case ought to be referred to the Court of  Aides  and his reasons were that it belonged to that Court to take Cognisance of the Estates of Farmers of the King's Revenues wherein the King himself was concerned directly or indirectly That in the Case between  Madame Fremont  Mr  Onneuil  and him the King's Interest was manifestly  oncerned seeing the Question was if they had concealed the Effects that had belonged to a man imployed in the King's Revenues There was scarce any Person of Note or Interest whether at Court or in the City but solicited the one or for the other Party And though the Mareshal  de Lorges  and his Lady seemed not to concern themselves in the Business in which it was thought that if they would declare themselves it would be in favour of their Son in law and their Daughter rather than for  Madame de Fremont  and her Son yet they solicited underhand for these They considered that besides that the Memory of the deceased ought to be dear unto them not only because he was the Father of the Mareshal's  Lady but because he had been a great Benefactor to them both before and after their Marriage They ought therefore to do all that was in their Power for saving his Estate from being seized They thought it was very likely that though the Stroak could not fall upon themselves because of the Precautions they had taken both in their Marriage Contract and in the Gifts they had afterwards received yet it might fall upon their Daughter who instead of having the Crowns that  Madame de Frem  nt  and Mr  d'Onneuil  were willing to pay her she might be in hazard of losing the whole of it  These Solicitations and underhand Dealings how close soever they were kept yet came to the Duke's Ears and enraged him to a greater degree against his Father in law and Mother in law so that it was observed of him that he took as much pains to obtain what he had desired of the Council as he did Four or Five Years ago to shun the Weight of King  William  of  England  's Arm But all the pains he took turned at last to his Confusion for he was cast before the Council and the only thing that the Chancellor said to him that could please him because of the Hatred he bore to his Ladie's Grandmother and Uncle was that when such People as the deceased had been did marry their Daughters or Grandaughters to Persons of Quality it was the first Step they made to restore to the Publick what they had robb'd it of but by the good leave of that Magistrate I do not think that the Name of Restitution agrees well to such an Action as that For to restore a thing is to give it back after it has been taken and to give it back to the rightful Owner too but for a Man to loaden his Children or Grandchildren with Money and by great Wealth to purchase to them a Blood that cannot mix with theirs without some sort of Shame and then to call this Restitution was an odd way of speaking and it is the first time I ever heard it call'd so The Duke  de Lau  un  being cast by the Council and the Case remitted back to the  Requêtes du Palais  their Friends offer'd to mediate for an Agreement between them They perswaded the Duke as well as  Madame de Fremont  and her Son to submit the Cause to the Arbitration of Two Counsellors of State and having chosen  Monsieur de la Reine  and  Monsieur de Ribe  re  they told the Duke that these Two Magistrates being great Lovers of Justice would give him as much satisfaction as the  Requêtes du Palais  would do provided he had a just Cause But having got private Intelligence that he could not expect great satisfaction from these Two Counsellors of State and that they had said that they did not think that the Widow or Children of a  Donor  could be obliged to pay ready money when the Deceased had not left any he became so suspicious of them that he recalled a Blank he had signed with an Obligation to acknowledge them for Judges And would prosecute the Matter in all the Forms before the  Requetes du Palais  who laugh'd at his Pretensions and a merced him in the Expences of the Suit  If  Fre  ont  's pretended hidden Treasure mde  a great noise and made many People say that there was never a Par  isan  i e  one that Farms the King's Revenues saved since he who had robb'd the People of so much money by his Extortions had not been at pains to restore any part of what he had robbed yet there was one of them that gave some grounds to think that there are some People of that Employment who sometimes think of their own Salvation But I do not know if it be enough for a man to think upon it only as he did for I think if a man be as much concerned in it as he ought to be he must join Effects and Deeds to his Thoughts whatever may be the Result of them However this Business made as great noise as the pretended hidden Treasure did of which I gave just now an Account One of these Farmers of the Revenues whose  Name I have forgot died and left Two Children behind him who did not live in great Friendship together which happens often betwixt Brothers The Father had in his Will considered the one much more than the other with which this last was very ill pleased and resolved to make his Brother uneasie and threatned to tell Mr  Fonchartrain  of their deceased Father's Management unless he would let him have an equal share in the Estate I know not if he was such a Fool to do what he threatned or if one who had been his Father's Clerk had done as Mr  Fremont  's Clerk did But  Mr Ponchartrain  being informed soon after their Father's Death that there was something found among his Papers that might turn to the King's Advantage he sent a Commissary from  Paris  to seal up all the Papers which he had in the place where he died It was within the Generality of  Alencon  and Mr  de Pommereu  's Son who was Intendant of it receiving Orders to be present when the Cabinets Coffers  c  were to be sealed the whole Business was done with all the Precautions that could possibly be taken in a matter wherein they were afraid to be cheated And the Intendant left a Garrison to continue there till the Seals should be taken off This Business frightned all the  Partisans  who were afraid their Children and Goods might be used the same way after their Deaths But because in the time of so burthensome a War the Court had often need of them it was not thought convenient to discourage them and therefore a Report was spread among the People that the reason why the Papers  c  of the deceased were sealed up was because he had made a Will in favour of the King When they had observed all the Forms that were usual on such Occasions so that there was no reason could be given for any farther delay the Intendant returned from  Alencon  to assist at the opening of the Seals which was done with all the usual Formalities and in the Inventory of the Papers  which had been left by the Deceased it was found there were Two Papers by which the Partisan had declared that God had given him Grace to examine his Conscience and that he would not adventure to go into the other World without restoring what he had taken wrongfully In the first of these Papers which clearly appeared to have been first done tho' it was neither dated or signed he said that he had by indirect and unjust methods gain'd Crowns during the time he had been concerned in the Revenues so that it was his Will that his Heirs might restore that Sum to the King as for the other Paper it was found to have been written after the former for it contained a Declaration that after a mature and serious Reflection upon all the Business he had been concerned in he found that he had made an unjust Acquisition of Livers so that it was his Will that his Children should restore it to his Majesty out of his Estate The Intendant sent Copies of the two Papers to Mr  Pontchartrain  who in such a matter would not rely upon his own Judgment which was that tho' they were not dated or signed so that they would not signifie any thing between Two private Persons yet it might be otherwise when the King was concerned in them He therefore consulted all those whom he thought capable to determine so nice a Question some were of one opinion and some of another Those who were more for the Forms of Law than for material Justice did not think that the Heirs of the deceased could be sued in Law seeing such Papers were not regarded in any Court of Justice But on the other hand those who followed the Maxims of Mr  Pussort  the late Dean of the Council who as I have already said voted always in the King's favour whether his Majesty was Plaintiff or Defendant made use of his Authority to prove that the King had good reason to demand the Livers mentioned in the last of the Two Papers  Besides this Authority which they reckoned upon as a Law that had taken place in the time of a great Minister who had reformed the State and had put the King's Affairs into an excellent Condition by the prodigious Taxes that had been laid upon the Partisans they alleged also that when a man did acknowledge in a Paper written with his own Hand that he had unjustly acquired such a Sum of money that was by a Thousand times a more convincing Proof than all the other Proofs that could possibly be had  Mo  sieur Po  chartr  in  was much of the same opinion as the truth is a man can hardly be of another Yet there are certain Rules of Law which must be observed least the Laws themselves to which they r  late should be violated And therefore he spake nothing either for it or against it unless that it was to be wished that all the Partisans which had been formerly taxed had done as this man did since that would have been an established Rule by which the King might have legally demanded what they had cheated him of Because of this Expression it was thought that he was much of  Mr P  ssort  's mind as to the Partisans yet it was an Expression no man could find fault with for besides that common sense will not allow a man to accuse himself unjustly he was obliged to say all this as suitable to his Office However all the Effects of the deceased Farmer of the Revenues were seized so that though he who had been the Informer in this matter had not promised to find out as  Mr de Fre  ont  's Clerk had done yet the Information was found to be truer The great need the King had of money at that time to support the War was the reason that this Minister thought it not proper to neglect such a Business Though to speak the Truth it was so small a matter in comparison of what was needful to the support of that War that it was no more capable to do it than it is for a drop of Water to quench a great Flame  Though the King had been already necessitated to make a great many Edicts yet he was still obliged to make new ones and one among the rest which gave occasion to a witty Expression of the  Duke de Ferte  's at least it was reckoned witty by some little pretenders to Wit though I confess I am not of their mind whether it be that I am but an ill Judg or that they have been mistaken at that time This Edict was concerning Coats of Arms belonging to Families All the People of Quality were striving who should make the best Projects for bringing in Money to the King for they knew His Majesty would reward them for it and most of them had need of some reward because of the great Expence they were at in the Army and at Court The Dutchess of  Roquelaure  was the Author of this Project and had a good Reward for it and being come to  Versailles  some days after with a very rich Petticoat many of those little Pretenders who were standing round about the Duke  de la Ferte  who made them sometimes laugh desired him to take notice of that rich Petticoat and to admire it He said that it was no wonder it was rich and fine seeing it was strew'd and deck'd with all their Scutcheons This was the witty Expression that was so much talk'd of Though I thought there was as little Wit in it if not less than in another which he had some days after upon occasion of the King's going to S  Germain en Laye  to pay a Visit to K  James  and his Queen Those who were with the Duke asked him why the King went so often thither he said he did not exactly know what might be his Majesty's Reason but he guessed that the General Peace being now upon the point of being concluded so that K  James  could not stay any longer in that Kingdom The King went to acquaint him with the Article of Six Months stay Every body was perswaded that seeing by this Peace the King was to acknowledge King  William  for Rightful King of Great Britain K  James  would not stay and see his Ambassadors come to His Majesty's Court and that therefore he would go to  Rome  or at least to  Avignon  to conceal his Misfortunes But as he has learned by the Exercises of Piety and Devotion which he has practised these many Years past to take the saddest events as from the hand of God so it is now found that the Duke  de la F  rte  was out in his guessing when he thought that this Prince would soon leave S  Germains  Yet K  James  resolved not to let the Peace be concluded without making the Confederates sensible that the Alliance they had entered into with K  William  for setting him upon his Throne might be of dangerous consequence to themselves He caused a  Manifesto  to be drawn up and copies of it to be given to all the Ministers of Princes and States that were concerned in the Conferences at  Reswick  In this  Manifesto  he vindicated himself from an Imputation that his Subjects had charged  him with which was that he had been always so strictly in the Kings Interests that he would never enter into any Treaty with any other Potentates for reducing his Power which was become formidable to all  Europe  And the Confederates themselves who had often endeavoured to gain him but could never prevail whether it was that he was really in his Majesty's Interest or that he thought it was for his own Interest not to engage in War against him made also use of the same pret  xt when they deserted him For when he sent some of his Servants to their Courts after K  William  was entered into  England  and desired them that they would not give any assistance to that Prince they met with so very cold a reception that it is impossible to find its Parallel And the Pope himself did as it were mock at him so that the Person whom he sent to  Rome  brought nothing back but Beads instead of Summs of Money tho' he informed his H  liness that the true Reason of his Misfortunes was that he had zeal  usly endeavoured to reestablish the Roman Catholick Religion in his Dominions but how much soever it was the Pope's Interest to have protected him upon that account Ye  his Holiness had his own share in those fears which the King's great Power gave to all the other Princes of  Europe  so that he would not hearken either to what Religion advised him to or to what the Ordinary Interest of Popes uses to suggest to them on such occasions After K  James  had published his  Manifesto  he met with the same treatment be had met with before for tho' he clear'd himself as well as he could from the accu  ation I have already mentioned and endeavoured also to make the Consederates sen  ble that they might come to fall under as great Misfortunes as had befallen him if they should sufter that by the T  eaty of Peace which was upon the point of being concluded the Prince of  should be acknowledged King of  England  Yet they did not think it convenient to treat him better than they had done before So that there being no hopes left him of being restored to his Throne unless some great Revolution should happen in his Country He intreated the King that what Treaty soever he should make with his Enemies yet he  ight never oblige him to go to any great distance from his Court He thought Prudence obliged him to ask this of his Majesty For he remembred how after his Father's misfortunes his Brother and he had been forced to depart out of  F  ance  where they thought to have found protection  The End of the First Part  MEMOIRS Of the Court OF FRANCE And of the City OF PARIS  PART II  K  James  's Manifesto had no effect It being the Interest of all the Confederates to keep K  William  upon the Throne that he had mounted by the unanimous consent of his People they took no notice of it The Plenipotentiaries at the  Reswick  Treaty carry'd on the Conferences without any great Concern in his Interest All that  France  could do on his behalf was a secret Article providing for the  een his Wife's Joynture to be sign'd at the same time with the Treaty The insignificancy  of this  Manifesto  appear'd in his most Christian Majesties Declaration to all the Allies that he own'd K  William  as the lawful King Without which Article he could expect no Accommodation This accknowledgment did not  uch perplex that Prince who went upon sure grounds For in the Articles of Peace propos'd by the King when his Plenipotentaries offer'd to state that Article he advis'd 'em to dash it out because he knew very well how to keep up the Dignity confer'd upon him by the Parliament of  England  with the Succours of his People and Allies So that this Question was to bear no Figure among those contested by the respective Parties  In the mean time the Armies pursuant to their usual Custom made preparations for the Field and the King having reenforc'd his Troops with those he had recall'd from  Italy  would not listen to the Truce that was offer'd to him by the Allies The Mareshalls  Villeroy  and  Boufflers  Commanded the Army in  Flanders  which was the most considerable But tho' they succeeded to the command the Duke of  Luxemburg  had before his Death yet they were far short of succeeding to his Reputation  Villeroy  for his first Adventure suffer'd the Prince of  Vaudemont  to escape whom he might have entirely defeated And his carelesness not to mention his Insufficiency occasion'd the loss of  Namur Boufflers  having thrown himself into that Place made so sorry a Defence that after his return from that Expedition L'  Apparat  who was chief Engineer at the Siege of  Barcelona  told him to his Face That if he had been within the Walls of  Namur  it had either been still in the King's Hands or else he had cut off a great part of K  William's  Army The  Mar  shal  was mightily surpriz'd with this Discourse which seem'd to charge him either with Cowardice tho' indeed  L' Apparat  was mistaken if h  took that for his weak side or else with want of Experience for one of these two must needs have occasion'd the loss of that Place However he reply'd That his success before  Barcelona  made him take such measures as became him very ill and that he would make him eat in his words were it not that he knew he had receiv'd some Blows on the Head which had turn'd his Brains  L' Apparat  made Answer That the Mareshal ought not to apply to himself what he mean'd of another that he pray'd God to forbid that ever he should censure his Conduct that he was very sensibIe of the deference and respect that was due to him that he only mean'd that Mr  de Megrigny  who was employ'd to defend  Namur  in the Quality of  Engineer  had acted his part so very ill that he would not stand to affirm that he either wanted Courage or at least had forgot himself By this means  L' Apparat  clear'd himself And the  Mareshal  was very well pleas'd to see him throw upon another what he had apply'd to himself But Soldiers do not always examine things so nicely whoever has the General Command they impute all their good or bad Success to him The whole Army regretted the loss of their late General Besides there was a vast difference between him and those who fill'd his Post Mareshal  Villeroy  was puff'd up with a great Opinion of himself tho' at the same time he never had done any thing upon which he could ground so much concei  edness On the contrary the Soldiers call'd to mind how contemptuously his Father treated him upon his return from the Siege of  Lisle  by reason of some Charge  laid against him insomuch that if he had not by a desperate turn retriev'd his Reputation in the Conquest of the County which happen'd the next Year he had run the risque of never returning As for Mareshall  Boufflers  'tis true he could not be charg'd with any such thing for he was so cautious and irresolute that 'twas manifest he was a stranger to that Presumption that render'd the other unsupportable But after all this irresolution spoke him diffident of himself for which reason the Soldiers said The Duke of  Luxemburg  read what he had to do in his Hunch but neither of the present Generals could find any thing in their Heads  Some Hours before that General's Death he call'd the Duke of  Montmoran  y  his Eldest Son to his Bedside and gave him to know that to make him easy he behov'd to give him a Promise which would afford him some Comfort in his Passage to the other World The Duke of  Montmorancy  promising Obedience to his Commands the poor dying General buoy'd up with Hopes told him  That since he had been long  Marchioness  f  Belle  onds  be the Fool to Marry her  on  des  'd he would  upon  not to Marry her when his Eyes were    This Lady was the Duke of  Mazarin  's  Her Father's Devourness occasion'd her being Married to the Marquis of  Bell  fonds  for the  his Father was as devout as the  but the Ma  quis was not a proper ma  for her  or he had  i  er the Estate nor a thousand other things that a Lady of her Quality might have expected in a Husband However as Children do not always follow their Father's  ootsteps so the Marquis was not near so devc  t as the Maresh  ll upon which account  the Duke of  Mazarin  frequently repented that he had made him his SoninLaw At last after the Marquis had liv'd some time with the Duke's Daughter he was Kill'd at the head of his Regiment in the Battle of  St  enkerke  The Government of  Vincennes  being given by the Duke of  Mazarin  with his Daughter became vaca  t by the Marquis's Death so that the Marchioness was but in sorry circumstances for a Lady of Quality For tho' the King gave that Government to her Son and the survivorship to the Maresh  ll of  Bell  fonds  yet the incomes arising to her out of her Husband's Estate were but very narrow 'Twas for this reason that the Duke of  Luxemburg  fear'd his Son's Marrying of her he being then a Widdower by the Death of his Wife who was a Daughter of the Duke of  Chevreuse  The Duke of  Montmorancy  whom his Father never press d to any thing that was not to his advantage readily comply'd with his Father's Demands in giving his Promise Two Days after the Duke of  Luxemburg  Died and his Son resolv'd to stand to his Promise tho' he continued still to visit the Widdow and even became more in Love with her than before However having no Issue by his Wife and being a Person of a great Figure in regard of the Government of  Normandy  which his Father had procur'd him he had a mind to Marry again The Marchioness of  Seignelay  was a proper match for him both for Estate and Quality She was very handsome and her Age bore a suitable proportion to his But this Lady being the Widdow of a Minister of State in whose lifetime every body stoop'd to her stood upon the point of Honour when she preceiv'd that the Duke's Agents pretended that she behov'd to give the Duke considerable odds  because she had Children after which she would never hear of the Proposal agen She thought that notwithstanding her Widdowhood she was at any time as good as the Duke of  Montmorancy  who had assum'd the Title of  Luxemburg  after his Father's Death and that it became him to treat with her at even hands The Duke finding she would not give him any thing look'd out for a Wife elsewhere and having pitch'd upon the only Daughter of the Marquis of  Clerembaut  who had formerly a place in  Monsieur  's Houshold Married her a few Days after She was but fourteen Years of Age and was very Pretty tho' she was not a Beauty Her Mother being the Widdow of Count  du Plessis  the present D  ke of  Choiseul  's Eldest Brother had Married her Husband for Love and being acquainted with the Pleasure of the Conjugal State when Man and Wife live in perfect Union would needs put her SoninLaw upon the same Foot with the Marquis of  Clerembaut  She us'd all manner of perswasives to oblige him to keep Company with no Woman but his Wife But the D  ke of  Luxemburg  having Married her Daught  r only for his Interest and having always Lov'd the Marchioness of  Bellefonds  did not like her Remonstrances He told her all the World was not like her Husband and scarce any body but himself could confine their Addresses to one Woman His MotherinLaw not discourag'd by this answer renew'd the attack several times She would even oblige him never to see his Mistress again But the Duke would never give her his Promise to that effect upon which she put the shrew upon him and treated him just as if the regulation of his Conduct had been her Province The Duke did not like her ways However to make her sen  sible  that  that  was not the way to win or break him he redoubled his visits to the Marchioness of  Bellefonds  This put the Old Woman into a Passion She teaz'd her SoninLaw so incessantly that he was oblig'd to tell her he would either take away his Wife to another House for they liv'd all together the MotherinLaw and her Husband being oblig'd by the Contract of Marriage to give them both Lodging and Diet or else Dine and Sup always abroad And indeed he was as good as his word But when he saw all his Remonstrances were ineffectual he began to lye out in the Night sometimes in the  Bagnio  's and sometimes in  LuxemburgHouse  which was still furnish'd But all this was so far from producing the proposed Effect that his MotherinLaw grew still more uneasy and troublesome insomuch that he was quickly oblig'd to leave her for good and all  This Duke had three Brethren and two Sisters one of which Married the Prince of  Neuschattel  as I intimated above The other was shut up in a Convent but would willingly have come out if she could As for the Brethren one of them was hunchback'd like his Eather For which reason the late Duke of  Luxemburg  design'd him for the Church pursuant to the common Practice of Persons of Quality who allot only to God Almighty what is not fit for the World The two other Brethren were Count  Luce  and Chevalier  Luxembourg  The former being already a Brigadier in the King's Army and in good repute among the Soldiers quickly assum'd the Title of Duke of  Chatillon  upon the Death of the Dutchess of  Mekleburg  his Aunt who made him her universal Heir and among other things left him the Dutchy of  Chatillon  with the Lands of  Marlau  which brought in better than forty thousand Livres a Year The King reviv'd that Dukedom in his Favour for it had lain extinct by the Death of the Duke of  Chatillon  his Aunts first Husband This new Duke Married afterwards  Mademoiselle de R  han  descended of an infamous Branch of the House of  Tremouille  for the Marquis of  R  han  her Father and her GrandFather as well as the Abbot of  Tremouille  her Uncle were Persons that did not deserve such Illustrious Titles As for Count  Ol  nne  her Father's Elder Brother 'tis true he had more Sense than either her Father or the Abbot and did not love Drinking as they did But after all he had never been much known in the World if his Wife had not made up that Defect for the care she took in spreading his Reputation was Crown'd with such admirable success that there were Generals in the Army who were not so much spoken of as he However he did one thing that met with a general Approbation from the World namely his separation from her as soon as he saw her bestow upon others what was only his due But having inur'd himself to her Customs while they liv'd together he retain'd a Tincture of 'em after her departure He lov'd to see a great deal of Company in his House as she did in hers and a great many met there and G  m'd every Night By th  s means His Majesty who always discourag'd Impiety came to be inform'd that he w  nt beyond many others in a dexterity of Coin  Oaths Upon this His Majesty sent him word  That if he continued in that course  e  me to repent it ere long  This Compl  ent made him wiser than he was before so that what further Progress he made in his wonted  Course was done Incognito 'Twas to be wish'd that the King's Authority could have reform'd his Brethren as soon as himself Tho' Swearing was not their Crime yet one would not have taken them for Persons of Quality unless he had known them The Chevalier  de Rohan  and the Abbot  Tremouille  lodg'd in a scandalous TipplingHouse tho' the last was worth almost ten Thousand Livers a Year and the first had enough to Live upon Upon this account a Gentleman belonging to the Court to oblige them to recollect themselves sent 'em a great Pacquet Countersign'd by a Secretary of State as if it had come from the Court 'Twas address'd  To my Cousins the Abbot  Tremouille  and Chevalier  Rohan  at the six Monks Tavern in  Paris 'Twas deliver'd to their Landlady at a time when they were abroad and tho' they had not much Sense yet they understood it to be a ridiculing of their Drunkenness The name of  Cousin  in the Subscription was a Privilege that all their Family formerly enjoy'd tho' at present 'tis confin'd to the Eldest So that if they were not Dukes and Peers as they are at present yet the King would always Dignifie them with the Title of My  Cousin  unless His Majesty pleas'd to take that Prerogative from them as he has sometimes done to other Families  For instance the Counts of  Clermont Lodeve  whose Posterity the Marquis of  Sessack  pretends at present to renew This Family I say in former times were intitled to the same Privilege and 'tis only of late that the King depriv'd 'em of it and that upon this occasion The Elder Brother of that Marquis being order'd to the  Bastile  by reason of a Blow he gave to the Bishop of  Londeve  in  Languedock  was  in a quanda  y whether he should obey the Order or not because he was not styl'd  Cousin  in the Seal'd Letter that was sent him However Count  Olonne  who was worth almost forty Thousand Livers a Year having no Children resolv'd to marry Chevalier  Rohan  his Brother in hopes that the Offspring would not resemble the Father There being few Ladies of Quality tho' never so Ordinary and Poor that would accept of him for a Husband He fix'd upon one of his own Cousins that had nothing namely  Mademoiselle Noirmoutier  Sister to the Dutchesses of  Brachiane  and  Lanti  She was likewise of the  Tremouille  Family and the Daughter of the Duke of  Noirmoutier  who had so great a hand in the first  Paris  War As soon as he open'd the matter to her she trembled from top to toe as being acquainted with the Character of her design'd Husband but his promise of settling his whole Estate upon his Brother in case the marriage went on and a great many other things that he represented to her as matter of Comfort did so tame her that she presently comply'd And thus she married the Man in the World that deserv'd least to be Lov'd and upon other scores had so little knowledge of his own Character that some time after when some Citizens came to Game at her House  e of 'em not knowing the Chevalier and seeing him offer her a Seat bid him give her another because that one did not please her  Mademoiselle Noirmoutier  who then enjoy'd the Title of Marchioness of  Rohan  was oblig'd to put up a great many other Affronts But Gaming which she lov'd to the last degree made amends for every thing and the Profit she drew from it compensated the avarice of Count  Olonne  who having made her Husband  his Heir was so sharp set that he would give him nothing while he Liv'd Mr  Harlei  SoninLaw to the present Chancellor lov'd Gaming as passionately as she and us'd to game in her House where he made such a Voyage that a few such more would have ruin'd him She and Madam  Theron  won twenty Thousand Crowns of him at one bout and upon such losses it being natural to offer some Plea or other for not paying he did not do as Mr  Verthamont  did for instead of paying the Money without any words in order to stifle the scandal he gave it out that he was Cheated The Chancellor displeas'd with his Conduct told him 'Twas a sorry Excuse and that when the King had catch'd a Man cheating him he expell'd him the Court which was a Lesson for others that it behov'd him to follow In fine he gave him twenty Thousand Crowns to be deliver'd to those that won that summ of him The Marchioness of  Rohan  had several such little Jobbs which help'd her out while she waited for Count  Olonne  's Death At last he Died as well as her Husband who left her only one Daughter Upon this she resolv'd to breed up her Daughter as a great Heiress and to enjoy her self But as the saying is Man proposes and God disposes Her self was snatch'd away soon after 'em She was seiz'd with a violent Pain in a very sensible Part and to appease the unsufferable Pain and procure her some Rest she took a Dose of  Opium  that was somewhat stronger than ordinary immediately after the taking of it she slept effectualy but so as never to awake for next Day she was found Dead in her Bed 'Twas her Daughter that the Duke of  Chatillon  Married And tho' she was the Daughter of a Father and Mother that  were not very well spoken of and withal not so agreeable as her SisterinLaw yet she found out the secret of living more happily with her Husband than the Dutchess of  Luxemburg  did with hers For that Duke continued still to visit Madam  Bellefonds  which inrag'd his MotherinLaw so much that if she had  had  her Will she had taken her Daughter from him But as there are some Rules in the way of Justice that one is oblig'd to follow in spite of all that may happen so it behov'd both she and her Daughter to be patient  At the same time the King gave a Pension of six thousand Live  s to Madam  de Cav  is  and when he bestow'd the Gift gave her to know that he was angry with himself for being so late in gr  ti  ying her and that she should lose  thing by staying so long for that the Pre  t he then made her was but a Pattern of what he design'd to do for the future both for h  and h  r Husband Mr  de Cavoy  was grand Marshal of the apartments of the King's House a place that entitled his Predeces  ors to the order of the Holy Ghost But at the last installment he had not that Dignity Conferr'd upon him tho' many others that had not so much reason to expect it as he were then invested with it The reason was said to be this He appear'd to be too much interess'd in some things for which he employ'd the Marquis of  S  ign  l  y  's I  terest being in very good terms with that Minister For the purpose the Scene was l  id between him and a Merchant to whom he promis'd upon a consideration of Ten Thousand Crow  s to release a Vessel of his that had been s  iz'd as a true Prize And in effect he pro  r'd the Restitution from that Minister upon whom it depended But as every Man has En  mies  so those that had an interest in the Confiscation of the Ship took occasion to acquaint the King that Mr  Cavoy  in consideration of a private Interest had caus'd a seizure to be restor'd without a valuable Ransome Up on this His Majesty revers'd the Decree that the Counsel had given on the Merchant's behalf So that his Ship and Cargo was confiscated anew and sold for the King's Benefit This done Mr  de Cavois  was obliged to return the ten Thousand Crowns he had already fingered And forasmuch as he did not repay it till he was pressed and urged to it It came to the King's Ears for there are always People about Court that are never a sleep when they have an opportunity of injuring their Neighbour Besides a chief reason why they would not forgive  Cavo  s  was That there was a misunderstanding between the Marquis  de Louv  is  and the Marquis  de S  ign  l    and the Creatures of the one hunted only for opportunities of ruining the Creatures of the other presuming that  ch a Sacrifice would be very agreeable to their  tron In fine the Death of the Marquis  de S  ign  l  y  had in a manner Buried Mr  de Ca  s  in his Master's Disgrace when the King  eviv'd him by this his bounteous present He had bought a House at  Lo  vettienne  a small Village about a Muske  shot from  Marli  At this place his Wi  e a Native of  Bri  tany  kept a Dairy and having made some Butter after the fashion of her own Country made a Present of it to the King as an acknowledgement of his late Bounty His Majesty lik'd the Butter above all things in the World insomuch that he desired her to send him some not only to  Marli  but to  Versailles  when he return'd thither  In the mean time the Marquis of  Cascaye  Ambassador from  Portugal  entertain'd the Publick with a very diverting Scene He was a very Rich Man and brought as much Silver Plate to  Paris  as might have served for twenty Ambassador's Tables He was a passionate lover of Gaming especially at  Lansquenet  which was always in vogue notwithstanding the efforts of a n  w Lieutenant of the  Police  to suppress it who for that end went about to several Houses of the City where the Gamesters Assembled Madam  le Camus Destouches  having a House in the Arsenal and being fearless of that Officer's Visits kept two days in the week for that Game The Ambassador went thither and having lost all his Money began to play upon tick An Adventurer that play'd at the same place and lost his Money as well as the Marquis being out of Humour happened to say  'Twas a strange thing to see Men loose their money every day and yet play upon Credit  The Gentleman spoke it with reference to some others that distinguished themselves that way as well as the Ambassador But the Ambassador applying it to himself testified his Displeasure by giving him two Blows upon the spot with all his force And to entertain him yet better ordered his Gentleman of the Horse who always followed him to give him some Blows with the flat side of his Sword The Gentleman of the Horse put his Master's Commands in Execution before the other could put himself in a posture of Defence so that he was treated at a very handsome rate Madam  de Frenoi  being present said  She wonder'd that a Man especially one of his Character would give such usage before Ladies there being several in the Company be sides her self  This she spoke in a finical way  affecting the air of Quality and that in such words as might make her pass for such But the Dutchess  de la Ferte  having a design upon her either because  de Frenoi  was handsomer than she or because she was one of the losers reply'd  That it did not become a little Cit like her to censure the Actions of a Person of the Marquis of  Cascay  's Quality  The Scene being thus changed they were so intent upon the new Dispute about  Decorum  that they forgot what had passed only the poor Man that was banged kept a heavy clutter Swearing and blustring that he would Die by it or have satisfaction for the Affront he had received But whatever was in it 'tis now almost a Year since the thing happen'd and I do not find that he has done any thing suitable to his words As for Madam  de Frenoi  she was as good a Tonguepad as the Dutchess and managed her Point to the advantage Some days after the Ambassador came again to the Royal Palace to play at the House of a Lady of another sort of Quality than Madam  Destouches  The Dutchess of  Ferte  happening to be there and retaining a resentment of the disagreeable words that Madam  du Frenoi  had uttered upon the account of his Conduct asked him if he ordered his Gentleman of the Horse always to follow him for he was with him then and indeed at all times followed him as close as a shadow does the Body The Ambassador was about to give her some answer or other but she interrupted him by setting forth that there was no body in the Company to beat so that the Champion would loose his time in staying there That it was a thing unheard of among Ladies of Quality such being in that Company to converse with a Man that at the last meeting had treated  their Sex without Respect or Honour and that if such things took in  Portugal  it was not so in  France  where the Ladies knew better things This last Article the Ambassador would not grant to her He had taken too much pains to learn of the Court and City Ladies how to play at Cards to quit the Profession so easily But as to the first Article He made Answer  That since she desired his Gentleman of the Horse should be sent away it should be done  The new Quarrel being thus put up they went to Gaming In the mean time the poor Fellow that was Drubb'd run up and down  Versailles  and  Paris  in quest of reparation for the A  tront But his Interest being insignificant in either He lost his Labour and put up the Blows He had received  The Marquis of  Ceaquin  continued still to slight his  ady and Her Relations understanding that He went often to the  Opera  and had a  d  a she Creature retaining to it ob  His Majesty an Order Prohibiting all  of Quality or any others to stand upon  For 'twas there that several In  were first set on Foot which were afterwards improved behind the Scenes and at last finished elsewhere This unsow'd a great many little Sparks that went thither only to belch out a thousand smutty and rank Stories among these Women who did not so much as wrap up the foulest Bawdry in clean Linnen For they were all so very Lewd that they did not blush to speak themselves such things the very hearing of which would at other times have covered them with Confusion and Disorder  The Chevalier  de la Hilliere  Governor of  Ro  ro  Died about this time He had formerly been a Lieutenant in the LifeGuard He did not much distinguish himself in his Lifetime and I remember to have read some where or other That as he walked one day before the King the point of his Sword having pierc'd through the Scabbard gave His Majesty a prick in the Leg upon which the King told him  He believ'd his Sword never hurt any body before  I shall not confirm this piece of detraction of which His Majesty is less capable than another for whatever occasion Men of Quality may have given him to complain he never spoke to any of them in disobliging Terms But 'tis certain that tho' this Knight was not much talk'd of in his Lifetime yet it was otherwise after his Death He made a  Will  that many wonder'd at which was much of the same Nature with that made by the Farmer of the Revenues mentioned in the First Part of this Work Nay it was rather more valid for instead of choosing soft smooth Words to signify that he had cheated the King he downright owned himself guilty of  Robbery  He set forth in plain terms that he had Robb'd the King of twenty Thousand Livers while he was Governor of the Place abovemention'd and order'd his Heirs to make Restitution of the same before they appropriated to themselves one Farthing of his Estate A great many put in for his Government for there were People enough about Court ready to take the alarm upon any vacancy who wanted some Subsistence of the King because they had spent most of what they had in his Service But Mr  Bartillac  Lieurenant General of His Majesty's Forces had the best luck He had serv'd a long time without getting any thing and the King having gratified all the old Officers would  not let him be the only One that could say He was forgot▪  In the mean time Marshal  Boufflers  represented to His Majesty That he was dissatisfied with one of his Lieutenant Generals not that he was a Coward and unworthy of his Post but because he was so Sawcy that he had all the trouble in the World to make him receive his Orders The King reply'd that he ought to discard him and that would quickly make him easy This Marshal who is a younger Brother of the House of  Piccardy  serv'd first in the Guards in the quality of AidMajor After that his Eldest Brother Marrying Madam  Guenegaut  the Daughter of Mr  du Plessis Guenegaut  Secretary of State pay'd him down his Portion Then he bought the Royal Regiment of Dragoons and began to distinguish himself at the head of it in the Battle of St  Francis  Upon this Mr  de Turenne  who study'd to serve all the World spoke so much of him to the King that His Majesty had a deep impression of his Character After that he serv'd as the rest did till  Turenne  his good Friend Died Marshal  Crequi  who succeeded  Turenne  in the quality of a General could not endure  Boufflers  at first and charg'd him with intermeddling Officiously where he was not desir'd and very often without knowing well what he said He drew this check upon himself by boasting of some intelligence he had receiv'd of the Enemy For the Marshal being a proud Man did not like such doings alledging That they insinuated an accusation against him as if he had not taken all the necessary Measures for having as good intelligence as he Whatever was in it Mr  Boufflers  by his Patience conquer'd the General's Aversion and they became such good Friends that General  Crequi  was the first that confirm'd to His Majesty the Character that  Turenne  had given him of  Boufflers  And that Marshal having in the latter part of his Life retriev'd the eclipse he met with at  Consardick  Bridge his Confirmation did  Boufflers  no harm for the King befriended Mr  Boufflers  and having made him a Lieutenant General  after the Peace of  Nimeguen  rais'd him a  wards to a higher Post He was already Coll  General of the Dragoons and the late Duke of  Lesdiguieres  lent him Money to buy that Post perhaps more to disoblige the Marquis of  Louvois  than to oblige Mr  Boufflers  for that Minister design'd the Post for the Chevalier  Tilladet  his Cousin  German  tho' all the Army said he was less worthy of it than the other Considering his Interest at Court and Mr  Boufflers  his incapacity to purchase it he thought he could not miss the procuring of it to  Tilladet  especially since  Tilladet  had the most considerable Post next to  Boufflers  in the Regiment His design in procuring it to  Tilladet  was to transfer it afterwards to one of his own Sons for which reason he was not pleas'd with the Duke of  Lesdiguieres  for lending the Money And Mr  Boufflers  was for sometime doubtful whether the Marquis was his Friend or his Enemy But at last that Minister finding that Mr  Boufflers  had the King's Ear and that His Majesty look'd upon him as another  Turenne  not with reference to his capacity which was far short of that General's but by reason of his being disinteress'd like him and his inviolable respect for his Person That Minister I say upon these considerations drop'd the spite he had against him and accordingly did not oppose His Majesty's Bounty to him He was made Governor of  Luxembourg  after the King took it and Marshal  Crequi  Dying some time after His Majesty bestow'd upon him the Government of  Lorrain  which was vacant by the Marshal's Death After that the War broke out  he gave him the  Command of an Army tho' he was then but a Lievtenant General and order'd  Rubantel  a Lievtenant General and Lieutenant Collonel of the Regiment of Guards to receive Orders from him This disoblig'd  Rubantel  the more that he had  een Eldest Captain in the Regiment when the other was but  A  dMa  r  having succeeded to his Brother's Company who was kill'd in the Siege of  V  len  nnes  He would have shewn his Resentment before the Judges but his Interest was not great there because he had refus'd to marry Madam  S P  anges  who was since married to one  Verne  l  Judge of the Court of Requests So that they were not troubled at this his Mortifi  ation  He serv'd under this New General with a great deal of discontent but he quickly met with a greater Aff  ont for Mr  Boufflers  his Interest at Court gr  w so much that he had not only a blew Ribband but was made a Marshal of  France  Governor of the  French Flanders  and Collonel of the Regiment of Guards This last piece of Honour conferr'd upon him disoblig'd  Rubantel  more than any thing else for being Lieutenant Collonel of that Regiment he was oblig'd to obey his Orders every Day whether in Camp or at Court Some time after the King designing a review of that Regiment  Boufflers  made his review first in order to remedy all Deficiencies before the King saw them During this review Mr  Rubantel  sate upon Thorns and as soon as Mr  Boufflers  gave orders that the Regiment should file off before him mounted his Coach and came to  Paris  to avo  d the necessity of saluting him with Pike in hand The Marshal complain'd of this to the King And this was the Person that  Boufflers  pointed to when he told the King as we intimated above that he was dissatisfied with one of his Lieutenant Generals His Majesty finding it his  Interest to prevent such an occasion of scandal in his Army in which the measures of Subordination must always be maintain'd order'd  Rubantel  to be reprimanded by the  Marquis de Barbesieux  the Son of the  Marquis de Louvois  who had Died suddenly and whose place of Secretary of State he had succeeded to This did not make  Rubantel  the wiser for upon several other occasions he display'd an impatience in being subject to the Marshal upon which the King was so Angry that he resolv'd to take his Commission from him His Majesty discover'd part of his mind to the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  who told him that tho'  Rubantel  was in the wrong yet if his Majesty would be pleas'd to consider the Case he would find that his Crime as great as it was did not deserve so severe a Punishment that he had been Captain of the Guards Forty Years and tho' he was bound to give a blind Obedience to whatever Superiour his Majesty plac'd over him yet considering 'twas natural for a Man not to love to see himself commanded by another that had been long his Inferior 'twas very possible for him to depart from his Duty These words soften'd the King's Humour but his Majesty being oblig'd to put another in his place by reason of the ill consequences that might ensue upon the failure of an exact Discipline in his Regiments commanded the Marquis of  Barbesieux  to order  Rubantel  to resign his Post in Favour of Count  Avejeant  an old Captain of the Guards and  Marshal de Camp  This Count was the SoninLaw of the late Mr  Valot  the King's first Physician and was at first look'd upon by his Wife's Family as a person unworthy of their Alliance for she had a great Estate and he had scarce any But the King had a kindness for him because he was bred up his Page and chang'd his Religion betimes and in the progress of time he whom they look'd upon  as the most scandalous Member of their Family such as it was became not only the Ornament but the support of the same The like happen'd before to the Family of  Bourdeaux  which made almost as sorry a Figure as  Vallot  's The Eldest Daughter of the Intendant of the  Finances  a Widdow of a Member of Parliament being Courtted by Mr  Sanguin  the Father of the Marquis of  Livri  first Steward to the King inveigh'd so bitterly against him that she was heard say He was unworthy of being receiv'd into her Family But after all she was so wise and happy as to Court him when she saw him in Favour And if she had not engag'd him in her Interest she had been at a loss upon several occasions  To return from this Digression The  Marquis de Barbesieux  having deliver'd the King's Commands told  Rubantel  at the same time  That his Carriage to Marshal  Boufflers  had so displeas'd the King that he would never have done any thing for him if the Marshal had not interceded on his behalf that upon his Intercession his Majesty bestowed upon him the Government of  BaratuFort  with a Pension of four Thousand Livers and that he behov'd to return thanks to the Marshal upon that score Rubantel  considering that a great many of his juniors had some of them Governments long before and others more considerable Posts was so incens'd upon the Compliment that he immediately return'd the Marquis this Answer  That he would rather choose to receive no Fa  ours than to purchase them at that rate and that so long as he had the honour to serve his Majesty he thought he had done his Duty in such a manner as to deserve some grants without needing the recommendation of any one  This said he went away without staying for any reply and the Marquis  Barbesieux  having given the King an account of  his Answer His Majesty said aloud before all the Court  That he was not much surpriz'd with his procedure because he had known him long before to be a Man of that Kidney  He spoke likewise some other words which gave  Rubantel  's Friends a jealousie that he might come to be committed Thereupon the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  being touch'd with Pitty towards this unfortunate Man whose long Service seem'd to deserve a better Fate This Duke I say presum'd to offer to His Majesty all that he thought was capable to appease his Wrath His Majesty reply'd  That he would consider all his Remonstrances but that he had suffer'd so many things from him already that he wonder'd himself was so late in doing what he had then done that this was not the first time he had given him occasion to be Angry with him and that he had met with other instances of his insolence when he did not seem to take notice of it  These words displaying still a resentment the consequences of which were to be fear'd The Duke of  Rochefoucaut  took the Liberty to make Answer  That tho' His Majesty had bore something of ill humour in that Man yet he would be pleas'd to consider that he had stood the brunt of many a MuskerShot in his Service and for the space of forty Years the Regiment of Guards was never imploy'd in any Siege but he appear'd and ha  arded himself as well as any of the Regiment That himself had seen him Charge again five or six times when a great many Men were Kill'd That he had given equal proof of his Valour in I do not know how many Battels and had spent so much of his Blood that the honourable marks he bore in his Body deserv'd at His Maiesty's Hands a pardon for some escapes of his Tongue  This Discourse had the desired effect The King's Anger relented but things being then at another pass than in the Reign of Cardinal  Mazarin  in which Favours were obtain'd by complaining or pretending to be formidable for by such means two or three Persons got Marshals Staffs and others were preser'd to Posts of Honour This time I say being of a different stamp from that insomuch that the greatest Complaisance and Submission were necessary means for having Success the King did not renew the offer either of  Baratu  Fort or the Pension On the contrary he bestowed that Governor's place upon Mr  Bac  evilliers  who had been long forgot and whatever merit he might have was like to have continued so all his Life if he had not luckily been the Marquis of  Montchevreuil  's Sister's Son Without this Circumstance His Ma  esty had never heard of him for he had the misfortune to serve in the former War either in  Catalonia  or  Messina  And 'tis a great misfortune for an Officer of any Ambition to be so far out of his Master's sight He continued a great while Lieutenant Collonel of Horse But at last his Uncle being loaded every day with Royal Favours and  apprehending that it would be an unhandsome thing not to make his Nephew share in his good Fortune intreated Madam  Maintenon  to represent his Services to the King That Lady perform'd his request very willingly and the King told her frankly  That if she had not spoken to him he might have continued a long time without knowing that Officer that being the first time that ever he heard of his Name  Thereupon His Majesty made him a Brigadier without staying till he had a Regiment for him However the first vacancy was his and that he was scarce possess'd of when he was made a  Marshal de Camp  and soon after a Lieutenant General so that no Man was ever observ'd to rise so fast At last His Majesty Crown'd all his Favours with a Present of the above mentioned Government and took his Younger Brother into his  Houshould where he is at present an Ensign of the LifeGuards  Another Officer in the Army was yet more unfortunate than  Rubantel  for after being imprisoned in the  Bastile  and losing his Regiment which was worth better than ten thousand Crowns a Year he had never obtain'd his liberty if the Peace had not been made This was a Son of the Duke of  Tirconnel  's by a Lady that he had promis'd marriage to tho he never perform'd his Promise His Name was  Talbot  which was likewise the Duke's Name and is a Name very famous both in  England  and in  France  from whence that House deriv'd its Original He was a Brigadeer in the Army in  Italy  and had a Regiment there He came from that Country to Court about two or three Years ago at the time when King  James  pretended to Sail for  England  upon which King  James  bid  Talbot  follow him but  Talbot  made Answer  That tho' he had an  Irish  Regiment yet being in the Service and Pay of his most Christian Majesty he could not dispose of his Person without His Majesty  's  leave and that if he would be so kind as to speak of it to the King he would be glad to obey his Commands  I know not whether  Talbot  spoke these words with such an Air as signifyed his unwillingness to go or whether that Prince took it ill that one of his Subjects should say  He could not obey him without his most Christian Majesty's leave  But in fine Kine  James  discover'd by his Countenance that he had forgot that  Talbot  was the Son of a Man that had done him great Service and to this Day is by all that know him esteem'd the most faithful and affectionate to his Prince of any that we have seen for a long time  Talbot  perceiv'd this as well as the rest But whether it was that he did not trouble himself about it or that Wine which he lov'd too well had sunk his Judgment He told that  very Day to the  Marquis de Larré  at a Drinkingmatch what had pass'd between King  James  and him adding withall very imprudently whether through the influence of Wine or real Thought  That he could not imagine what that Prince mean'd to do in  England  and that he was respected or belov'd by very few every body almost being perswaded that he was a thousand times fitter for a Convent than for the Throne  Next Day the  Marquis de Larré  visited the  Marquis de Barbesieux  with whom he was in Favour and gave him an account of what pass'd between him and  Talbot  thinking perhaps rather to do him Service than to injure him For the purpose he might have in his view to inform that Minister of his inviolable Affection to the King's Service upon the comparison with K  James  's But the Marquis of  Barbesieux  having told the Story to a Lady that he Courted and she having told it to the Queen of  England  This Princess sollicited the King to cause  Talbot  to be taken up Accordingly he was taken up at  Versailles  and carried to the  Bastile  believing that a Prince of K  James  's Devotion would confine his resentment to a few days Imprisonment But as devout People are seldom guilty of granting Pardons or at least have no great Name for it so he was quickly made to understand that K  James  had a mind to have him broke The Dutchess of  Tirconnel  being a Lady of Honour to the Queen of  England  us'd her endeavours to prevènt the Blow that was about to reduce that poor Gentleman to the State he was in when he came from his Mother's Belly For tho' he had serv'd a long time and had great Incomes yet he had been so careless a Husband that he could scarce raise two thousand Crown  upon all he had Marshal  de Noailles  who was his Friend and under whom he had serv'd in  Catalonia  sollicited the King to avert the misfortune  But His Majesty reply'd  That it did not lie at his door and that if the King and Queen of  England  did not desire him to be broke he was satisfied  But at the same time he justly blam'd him for drawing that Disgrace upon himself and the Marshal could not excuse it otherwise than upon the score of Wine which often sinks the Reason of the most sensible Men Mr  de Vendôme  interceeded likewise on his behalf But 'twas all in vain For K  James  and his Queen made not only his Regiment but a Pension that he had to be taken from him And thus he had the mortification of seeing himself unplum'd by one stroak of his Tongue of all the Fruit of his Services And which is yet worse tho' at present he is at liberty I do not know that he has yet obtain'd any thing tho' I see him every day going from  Paris  to  Versailles  and from  Versailles  to St  Germains  He has been a long time without obtaining leave of K  James  and his Queen to come and beg their pardon their Majesties thinking it proper to shew that their Resentment continues still  Among all this matter of Affliction especially to  Talbot  and  Rubantel  as well as their Friends there happened a new Scene at  Paris  that may be entertaining to the Publick The Wife of one that belonged to the PayOffice a very Coquette Lady in her way had one day a mind to ride in her Coach Her Coachman having combin'd with some of her Servants to play her a trick got upon his Coachbox without dressing his Horses or cleaning the Coach The Lady ask'd him what he mean'd by serving a Person of her Quality in that fashion Her Quality after all was not very great but since Madam  du Fresnoi  the Wife of a common Citizen's Son when speaking of her self took upon her to say  A Woman of my Quality  by the same reason this good Woman might call herself a Lady of Quality for both her own  and her Husband's Father were something more than the others However the Coachman gave her no Answer knowing that nothing provokes a Woman more than not answering her whether she be in the right or the wrong She redoubled her reprimands to make him speak and finding that he was still mute attack'd him with threats and hard words At last the Coachman very unconcernedly answered her  That she made a great deal of noise for a small matter and if she would take his advice she should give over bawling and make no more words of it  The Lady inrag'd with such an insolent Answer redoubled her threats and abusive Language But the Coachman having kept the best to the last told her  That he wondered that such a one as she should be so ill to please and that she was too well served for a W  At that word she was out of all Patience and called up her Footmen who had sheer'd off on purpose to have the more Diversion by the Comedy They ran up to her all in a heat to know her Pleasure She ask'd them to act for her in being reveng'd upon that insolent Fellow The Footmen pretending to know nothing of the matter she gave them to know that he had the impudence to call her Wand that the least they could do was to break his Arms or Legs But she was mightily surpriz'd when instead of being provok'd as she expected they looked down Then she ask'd them what they mean'd by it and forc'd them to speak as if it had been against their Wills Their Answer which was much more provaking than any thing she had yet heard was  That if she wanted only to have her Coachman beaten she might go see for other Executioners that they would not beat or thrash any body without a just Cause and that they did not take speaking of the Truth to be such  She reply'd  That it seemed they took her to be a Was well as the Coachman did  And they Answer'd  very freely  That they knew her to be such and were ready to witness it when she pleas'd  This rais'd her Passion to that degree that she called upon the rest of her Servants to give her the succour that her Footmen had refused The first that appear'd was Mistress Cook who ask'd her what put her in such a Passion the Lady had no sooner told her the matter but she made answer  That the Coachman and Footmen were not much to blame and that they charg'd her with nothing that was not true  Then came in the Chambermaid who not being in the Conspiracy with the rest said  That 'twas not worth her while to make so many words and that she would go and call a Commissary to put them all in Prison  But that word cost her very dear for as soon as they saw her making ready to go out they fell upon her and beat her one after another The Lady fled to her Chamber for fear they should give her as much And at last the Chambermaid got clear and fled likewise to her Chamber Both of them bolted their doors and continued there waiting for the Master of the House in order to complain of the usage they had received The Coachman perceiving that his Mistress was mew'd up took the Horses from the Coach and curry'd them And in a word did all that was to be done in order to make it appear upon his Master's return that his Mistress was in the wrong But both he and his accomplices had us'd another precaution that was yet better They had complain'd four days ago to the Commissary of the Ward that she would not pay them their Wages and having at the same time given a Summons in order to have her cast in Court they only stay'd in the House till the Husband came and before his Wife could speak with him gave him to know that they would stay no longer with her because they could not get a Farthing out of her hands The Husband would have  kept them but they did not care to stay After they were all gone he was surpriz'd with an account of the tricks they had plaid with his Wife Had he been wise he would have advis'd her not to speak of the matter to any body and would have taken the same advice to himself But as every Man is not as wise as his Affairs require so he was the fool to go himself and complain of his Servants and thus was the first that divulged what he ought to have conceal'd But the Complaint given in by the Servants four days before made People believe that whatever he said was by way of Recrimination Upon which his Friends advis'd him to drop the thing and make no more noise of it They had much ado to perswade him for his Wife threw in all the fire she could to disswade him But at last his own Reason convinced him that  that  was his only way unless he had a mind to make himself to be pointed at as he walked along the Streets  As this Lady was branded for a  Coquette  by her Servants so I present you with a story of another that indeed had not that misfortune but was no less such in her Husband's Opinion Mr  Tourville  before he was made a Marshal of  France  married the Daughter of a Farmer General who was the Widdow of the Marquis of  Poplinicre  the Nephew of the late Madam  Colbert  'Twas a lucky hit for the Marshal to marry that Lady especially at the time when it happened for he was only a younger Brother in  Normandy  and that of a Family that was in no great Circumstances But Fortune stood by him when every body thought he was lost We must know that after the Marquis of  Seignelay  his Protector was Dead he was writ to from Court that then was the time or never to shew his mettle for he had never given proof of it all the time that he was employ'd as a  Marine  This Reproach serv'd for a Spur that twitched him to the Quick insomuch that when he receiv'd Orders to Fight the Enemies Fleet at any rate he did his Duty and tho' he was unfortunate in the way of Success yet he was thereupon prefer'd to that degree that if he had still been unmarried he could perhaps have desired no more of that Woman But whether it was that he began to slight her or that he thought he might keep Company with Misses without giving her any dissatisfaction He had a sweet Eye upon one of his Neighbours that she was as jealous of as of another She told him her Sentiments of the thing and not only took the pains to undeceive him but made a noise that was very troublesome to the Lady that she deem'd her for her Rival I cannot be positive upon the truth of the matter but 'tis said that this jealous Lady acquainted the Womans Husband with the Marshal's intimacy with her 'Tis likewise Reported that the Husband surprized them in a posture that did not allow him to doubt of the information he had received Whatever was in it the Woman was put into a Convent and the Marshal either out of the chagrin occasion'd by her confinement or through the discontent his Lady had given him upon other occasions sent her out of  Paris  to one of his own Territories His Plea was that she would not do something that he  desired of her and the pretence was the more specious that it related to his Interest But the Lady bore her Banishment from Town the more impatiently that she was eternally galled with jealousie and return'd to  Paris  without giving him notice She Lodged in his Apartment designing to lie so close that he should know nothing of the matter till her own Friends and her first Husband's Relations should have acquainted the King with the injustice done her The Marshal's  Servants seeing her come into his House gave notice of it to their Master who without asking her the reason why she returned without his order complained of it to the King At the same time he desired His Majesty to grant him a Warrant to put her into some Convent pretending by that means to enjoy all her Estate But His Majesty being informed of several things would not be so hasty and desired in the first place to know the occasion of their Divorce The Mareshal indeavour'd by all means to cover and perplex the Story and turned it upon the score of Interest but the King made Answer  That Commissioners ought to be appointed to inspect which of them was in the wrong  This was all that his Lady desired and thus she continued at  Paris  in spight of him and made it her business to thwart all his Intrigues  In the mean time his Misses Sister came to be married and that being a favourable opportunity of reconciling her to her Husband the poor recluse's Friends invited her to be present at the marriage He was a little restive upon the point However being uneasy in Living alone and wanting only to be urged to it he pretended that in marrying her he had not received the same advantages as they gave to his SisterinLaw If they pleas'd they might have given him the same answer as the Marshal  Feuillade  gave one day to the Brother of Mr  Courchamp  Master of Requests who is at present Master of the King's Houshold and Collonel of a Regiment of Foot He had a mind to be an Ensign in the Guards and that Marshal offering to sell him a Commission at double the worth he represented to him that it was not worth so much upon which the Marshal replied That he owned it was true but withall that he ought to know that  that  sort of Posts were sold according to the merit of those that pretended  to buy 'em That there was one price for a Man of Quality and another for such as he and in effect That neither his Physiognomy nor his Air would bring any honour to the Regiment I do not insist upon the Consideration of his Birth for that Regiment has been fill'd I do not know how long with Men of the same Degree and I think the Marshal had no reason to inflame the price of the Commission because he was only a Tradesman's Son But let that be as it will as I said before the Recluse's Relation might have alledg'd the same Reasons to her Husband Nay they had a better Title so to do for 'tis natural to give with a Girl in Marriage in proportion to the Circumstances of him that Marries her In fine he stood out boldly notwithstanding that he had a mind to take his Wife home again He was not present at the Marriage which was accompanied with a sad Scene for the Bride's Mother that was well but four Days before Died the same day that the Nuptial Benediction was pronounced The Bridegroom who did not marry any great Beauty was not much troubled at that Circumstance because he had no great prospect of Pleasure in her Company His Bride's Face promising but little satisfaction he willingly abstain'd from the Duties of a Husband upon the plea of the loss of her Mother But he could not handsomely put it off longer than the second Night at which time he was oblig'd to break the Ice And this comforted the new married Lady upon the loss of the first Night especially considering that she fear'd her Deformity would have eternis'd her Affliction  Another Lady was Married at the same time that would have taken it very ill if her Husband had thus amus'd himself with crying and lamentation on the WeddingNight 'Twas Madam  Girardin  the Widow of Mr  Girardin  who was first a Lieutenant of a Province and after that was sent Ambassador to  Constantinople  He had play'd his Game to good purpose for upon the Division of his Estate his Widow had above a hundred thousand Crowns for her share besides a great quantity of Moveables that was worth half as much She had likewise a good Marriage of it upon other scores which made her bear a good Figure insomuch that many Persons about Court had her in their Eye But she lik'd the Marquis of  Canillac  better than any other of her Suitors tho' he had nothing but his Sword to trust to This Lady had two Brethren one of them President to the Parliament and the other Master of Requests and Intendant of a Province Fearing they would oppose her Marriage if she discovered her Design she resolv'd to be Married without giving them any notice For they were both Lawyers and forasmuch as that sort of Men are very sharp Sighted where they have any Interest she would not be oblig'd either to have recourse to the King to stifle their Opposition or to secure herself at Law Thus was the matter concluded without their knowledge and it happened that on the WeddingDay the Intendant having arriv'd at  Paris  but twenty four Hours before sent her word by his Footman That he would come and Dine with her The Footman coming to the Gate was surpriz'd to find a Porter and Footmen with Liveries different from his and being introduc'd by one of these Footmen into my Ladies Chamber he found her a Bed with a Man However not knowing what the matter mean'd and not daring to ask any of her Servants he only deliver'd his Master's Compliment The Lady made answer That truly she had other things to mind than the giving his Master a Dinner and that she doubted if she could be stirring when he should come to  Dinner With the same Breath she bid him give her Brother to know that she only put off the Complment to another time and that then she would acquaint him with the Reason why she would not give him a meeting that day The Air with which she spoke these words gave the Footman to understand that she lik'd the Trade she had lately taken up When he return'd and gave his Master an account of all he saw or heard the Intendant went immediately to impart the good News to the President The President having known by Experience what small stress ought to be laid on a Woman's Prudence took the matter at first to be Criminal He thought his Sister had entertain'd a Gallant and told his Brother that he would ruine h  r and that they should think of expedients to prevent it The Intendant having a better Opinion of the Women than his Brother reply'd That he was too forward and that they ought not to Condemn their Sister upon such slight grounds and that he believ'd she was Married because his Footman said her Servants had changed their Livery The President who upon the hopes of having a share in her Succession had shewn his Displeasure upon the apprehension of her entertaining a Gallant was yet more disgusted when he heard of a Husband And forasmuch as all his remaining Comfort consisted in disanulling the Marriage in case she had Married a FortuneHunter He sent one of his Footmen to her Gate to know what Name she went by But when his Footman return'd and acquainted him that her Name was  Canillac  and that her Husband was an Officer in the second Company of Musqueteers he then was sensible that he had nothing to hope for upon that score  About the same time Mr  Bignon de Blansi  Master of Requests the Nephew of Mr  Pontchartrain  was likewise married to Madam  Hebert  Debuc  the Niece of Madam  Pompone  and the Daughter of Mr  Hebert Debuc  Master of Requests Mr  Blansi  was Brother to the Intendant of  Piccardy  His first Lady was Mademoiselle  Brunet  who died in Childbed when she was but twenty two Years of Age and left him no Issue Some days after his second marriage Mr  Pontchartrain  procur'd him a Commission for being a Master of Requests that might be worth two thousand Livres a Year He had another Commission before that brought him no Profit Tho' after all those who have such sort of Places continue still to desire them because they are not only Posts of Honour but make way for others that are more profitable Mr  Pontchartrain  who commonly has the disposal of that sort of things design'd this Post for Mr  Harouis  SoninLaw to Mr  Richebourg  Madam  Pontchartrain  's Uncle who besides the Honour of being her Kinsman was thereby qualified not only for this but for a more considerable Commission Accordingly he order'd Mr  Depinet  one of his Deputies that looks after such things to make ready an Act and carry it to the Chancellor But this Magistrate having a grudge against  Pontchartrain  instead of filling up the blank with  Mr Harouis  his Name according to  Mr Pontchartrain  's desire signfy'd to him by his Deputy ask'd him how long a Controller General had offer'd to give Laws to a Chancellor and at the same time gave him to know that he understood his own Business without being taught it and fill'd up the Blank with the Name of  Arnothon  Master of Requests  Depinot  returning to  Mr Pontchartrain  gave him an account of the Chancellor's Compliment  Mr Pontchartrain  was unwilling to make any noise tho' perhaps he had Reason enough only after that he did nothing relating to his Office without speaking first to the King so that it  was not in the Chancellor's Power to thwart him  Much about the same time there happen'd another marriage which I would be loath to insert here if it had not given occasion to one word that was taken notice of Mr  de la Ferrier  the Son of that  Berrier  whose memory is still odious to all the World tho' he has been a long time Dead This Man married his Daughter to the Son of  Des Chiens  whose Birth and Places bore a near resemblance to his Father and all that he did For tho' he had the Impudence to say that he was descended of a Noble Family yet all the Country bears witness that his Father and his Ancestors deriv'd their Extraction from the scum of the People However Mr  de la Ferrier  's Lady being GrandChild to the late Mr  Novion  first President his Alliance with that Family of which his Lady descended by the Motherside was so monstrous that all the World cried out that the Blood of the  Novions  was disgrac'd since whereas it was formerly mingled with that of  Luxemburg  in the Person of the late Count  de Tremes  Father to the present Duke  de Gevres  it was now bestow'd upon  Chiens Dogs  But the matter lay here these  Chiens  were furnish'd with Golden Teeth and the Father had got so considerably by the Places he had in this War that the  Novions  were nothing near so considerable as he This Mr  de la Ferriere  was not reckon'd a Beast either in Council or in his own Domestick Affairs tho' there was a time when he pass'd for a Bankrupt and upon that false Report 'twas said That the King would take all his Places from him for fear his Poverty should tempt him to be unjust in the discharge of his Offices But if we may credit what happen'd soon after the marriage of his Daughter to whom he gave nothing all this pretended Poverty was only a faint to  impose upon the Publick for his Brothers with whom he was at law for their Portions presented a Request to the Judges setting forth That their Father had left an Estate of two millions of money which he was actually possess'd of and that their Eldest Brother kep  it up without doing them Justice This Petition made his Creditors very uneasy They alledg'd That since his own Brethren had thus inform'd against him the Council before which they pleaded and which he endeavour'd to move to Compassion by his pretended Poverty ought not to have any regard to his Allegations for depriving them of their Right In former times Cardinal  Mazarin  made use of much such another Argument to ruine Mr  Fouquet  for Abbot  Fouquet  his Brother revil'd him horridly and whenever anybody offer'd to plead for him the Cardinal made Answer That they did not know Mr  Fouquet  so well as his Brother and that by consequence his Testimony was preferable to theirs And in effect the Abbot who was an odd sort of a Man being at once the greatest  Braggadochio  and the greatest Coward in the World This Abbot I say had a great hand in ruining the SuperIntendant He presented Memorials against him and 'tis well known what weight they were of when the question was put Whether he should be Arrested or not This Abbot was such a Vaunting Fellow that he pretended he would take the Prince and the Marshal of  H  quincourt  by the Beard to make them repent of their taking up Arms against the King But on the same very day that  Barbesieres  came from  l  nders  on purpose to carry off the Father of Mr  Girardin  mention'd above who was a famous  Partisan  somebody came and told the Abbot that the Prince had sent out a Party to take him up having heard the Stories he had spoke of him and thus put him in such  a Fear that he durst not venture to go out of  Paris  without a strong Guard  Soon after all these Marriages a Sentence of Banishment was granted against Medemoiselle  de Varennes  a Lady of Quality in the Country of  Maine  who was more known by the Affection that great Prelate had for her than by the Reputation of her Ancestors 'Twas said that this Affection was the effect of Amorous Embraces and that her Friend before his Death advised her to marry some Person of Quality that had nothing upon Condition that he should own her Children to be his He had made her so rich by his Bounty that he thought she was in a Condition to tempt every body 'Tis true there were a great many poor Wretches that would have been glad of such an adventure But 'twas not that sort of Men that she had a mind to Notwithstanding the scandalous terms she pretended still to have her choice and receiv'd Visits from all the Court in a House of hers that resembled an inchanted Palace To carry on the Wheedle the better she entertain'd them very handsomly and in  Lent  regal'd them with Meat notwithstanding the King's Orders to the contrary For His Majesty to put a stop to all manner of Libertinism had order'd that only those who were sickly or otherwise incommoded should have liberty to eat Meat with the Church's Permission and that they should not let any body share with them under the pain of incurring his Displeasure But tho' Madam  Varennes  was far from that Condition being in very good Health yet she not only eat of it herself but invited all her Visiters to eat with her The King got notice of this and sent her a Letter under the great Seal to be gone Her Friends promis'd her a Grant of some time before she went into Exile But instead of making preparations for her Departure she promis'd a  thousand Pistols to Count  Gramont  for procuring a Revocation of the Sentence Count  Gramont  being a Person that subsists only by the King's Bounty and at such Windfalls does not use to be asleep This Count I say did not pretend to deny the thing to the King that being the wrong way to compass his Design but represented to His Majesty That the Lady being set allalone at Table where she fed upon Mear pursuant to a permission she had from the Curate some people came in and surpriz'd her and in spite of her Teeth sat down with her that this was no infraction upon the design of His Majesty's Order and that all the World might be catched in the same Trap as well as she without they kept their Gates shut at Mealtimes as in a Convent In fine he pleaded her Cause with such dexterity that the King granted his Request upon a promise that the Lady would be more cautious for the future Then the Marquis of  Vieuxburg  began to declare himself a Sui  r to the fair Lady tho' he could not well do it without a breach of Faith to Mademoiselle  de Bulli  a Lady of Quality near  Neuchatel  in  Normandy  to whom he had given a Promise of Marriage He was the Son of the Chancellor's Lady and having lost his Eldest Brother at the Siege of  Namur  carried on by the Enemies succeeded to his Estate which was not inconsiderable The good Name he had in that Province together with this Succession and a little Honour if he had  had  any ought to have deterr'd him from so scandalous an Alliance But this Lady having inchanted him he open'd his mind to her and by the discovery of his Design pleas'd her so well that she offer'd to give him all she had provided he Married her In effect the business was kept private for some time and in the mean time the Chancellor's Lady happening to die both of them were sensible  that it was a favourable accident for them in reg  rd she would never have suffered her Son to be guilty of that Folly in her Lifetime The Chancellor who had been kept ignorant of his Lady's illness for some days and hinder'd from going to her Chamber under the pretence of some prejudice that might thereby accrue to either of their Healths This Magistrate I say gave his Lady a magnificent Funeral In the mean time he went and spent some days with the President  Fourci  and after that return'd to his own House and recommenc'd the exercise of his Office which has this privilege beyond all others That those who are invested with it never wear mourning either for their Relations or for the King himself Monsieur and Mr  de Chartres  gave him a Visit to Solace him upon his Loss The next day the Pope's Nuncio came to his House and every body thought he had come upon the same Errand But tho' the measures of Civility requir'd that Compliment especially since he came to the Chancellor's own House yet he made him another that quickly discover'd the chief reason of his coming However it was not disagreeable for after having assur'd him of the Pope's Respect for him and his Family He presented to him a Brief from His Holiness permitting the second Son of Madam  Harlai  his Daughter to possess all sorts of Abbeys even those mortgag'd to Regulars tho' he was then but nine Years of Age The reason that mov'd the Pope to this Dispensation was set forth in the Brief It imported that his Holiness was infinitely glad to hear that Mr  Harlai  was gone from  France  upon a design of making a general Peace and that His Holiness thought himself oblig'd to testify this his Joy by granting that favour to his Son But after all the Holy Father had not taken up this desire of giving Peace to Christendom till the King was expell'd  Italy  by the  Savoy  Treaty under the pretence that  Italy  would always be fetter'd so long as His Majesty was possess'd of any thing on that side Thus Popes Kings and great Folks talk as they will tho' at the same time they are glad to insinuate to others that they design nothing but what will redound to the advantage of those who are subject to them  Count  Marsan  the Youngest Brother of all the Princes of the House of  Lorraine  who married the Marchioness of  Siegnelay  after the Duke of  Luxemburg  broke off from her got at that time a Pension of Twenty thousand Livers This was matter of surprisal to everybody not only by reason of the small Service he had ever done to the State but because he had always a sorry Interest at Court For the purpose When he married the Marchioness of  Albret  Widow to the Marquis of  Albret Marshal de Camp  who was kill'd when he went to see his Mistress at that time the King turn'd that Lady out of the Queen's Retinue not that she had done any thing deserving that disgrace but only because she had married a Man that the King did not like The reason of the King's dislike was grounded on his having some intrigue with a Young Prince that His Majesty took care of and his being charg'd with cajoling and wheedling a Young Princess that he was equally concern'd for But after all he found ways and means to attone for all that and upon that score was oblig'd to his Lady who has Friends of Interest and Credit At present he enjoys above fifty thousand Crowns a Year tho' before his first marriage he was not worth a Groat and just now he has bought one of the finest Houses in  Paris  He had it from President  Tambonneau  and that Magistrate bore some hard words from the first President upon the account of some Difficulties relating to the execution of the  Bargain That House had formerly a large Garden to it part of which Mr  Tombonneau  cut off and joyn'd it to another House of his and Count  Marsan  alledg'd That tho' that part was cut off by a particular clause Calculated for that purpose yet at that time it ought to be undone because it return'd naturally to the purchase to which it had always belong'd They agreed to leave the matter to the Arbitration of the first President But whether this Magistrate was partial or thought it was justice to give it against  Tombanneau  He deliver'd his mind in such harsh terms as insinuated that he had overreach'd Count  Marsan  'Twas some time before Mr  Tambonneau  would agree to his Verdict but at last the matter was accommodated and at this day Count  Marsan  lives in that fine House Mr  Pontchartrain  had a mind for the House but being a Man of a different stamp from some Ministers who do not grudge to give any price for what they like he could not come up to Mr  Tombanneau  's price To be plain when a Man throws away his money at such a rate 'tis a sign he comes easily by it whereas good Husbandry speaks a fair purchase  The Princess of  Harcourt  whose Husband is of the same Family with Count  Marsan  but not  ear so Rich lost at that time a LawSuit with Madam  Nemours  which she thought she had been sure of 'Twas laid before the Council and related to the Register of  Lions  which she justly alledg'd to have been the property of her GrandFather by the Mother'sside This her GrandFather was the famous Farmer of the Revenue call'd  Garnier  who tho' he was Born to very little had got such a vast Estate that he might have boasted of greater matters than  Sebastian Zamer  did in former times for whereas this Man entitled himself a Master of five hundred thousand  Crowns the other might have pretended to sixteen millions He was effectually possess'd of eight millions clear of the best money in the World and the King owed him as much But soon after Mr  Fouquet  was catch'd the Court of Justice came upon him and there he was Taxed in proportion to what he had got so that his whole Fortune was melted in a moment By good luck he had married a whole Regiment of Daughters very handsomely and having pay'd their Portions in ready money Mr  Colbert  who rak'd into the very Branches of Families could find no plea to suck out the Blood that they endeavour'd to maintain their Honour with The Princess of  Harcourt  's Mother who was married to Count  Brancas  Gentleman of Honour to the Queen's Mother had thus escaped that Minister's scrutiny because all her Portion was money paid down However her Daughter was of the same Humour with her GrandFather so that it was not long of her if she was not Rich She lost the abovementioned Suit only by one Vote which she thought ought to have lest oppos'd her Having always been very careful in making interest with the Ministers she hop'd that Mr  Pontchartrain  who was one of the Judges would favour her But equity prevailing with honest Men beyond all other Considerations he was one of those that cast her Tho' after all when he was ask'd wherein Madam  Nemours  's Cause had the advantage of hers He reply'd That he could not well tell and that if he had thought the rest would have been of his mind he would have manag'd that Cause like the Oyster in  Boileau  's Satyrs in giving the two Shells to the two Princesses and the fleshy part to the King because the property contested by them belong'd in effect only to His Majesty The Princess of  Harcourt  who will never lose any thing for want of a vigorous  defence does not yet give her Cause over for lost and having sometimes been lucky in LawSuits she hopes to have the same good Fortune in this But since her Fortune has been out of her Hands these twelve or fifteen Years 'tis not probable that 'twill ever return to her She made a shift by the interest of one of her Friends to perswade  Mademoiselle de Guise  to give her Husband the Dukedom of  Guise  and  Guisehouse  which were worth at least three millions The procuring of this favour had cost the Prince of  Harcourt  some Compliments and Addresses to his Benefactress But his Humour being not so pliable as his Lady's he reassum'd his Character when he thought the business was done Madam  Guise  complain'd of this to the Friend that had acted the part of a Mediator and he being not able to perswade the Prince to continue his Visits she resum'd her Gift This Thunderstruck his Lady who upon this Affair had display'd her utmost prouess However she is to be commended for managing so wisely the Affairs of her Family which her Husband neglects He minds nothing but his Diversion while she scrapes up money to pay a Pension that she's oblig'd to give him upon the consideration of his having turn'd over all his Estate to her But the Times we live in being so unhappy that little can be made of a LandEstate she would find it very hard to do what she does if she did not find ways of getting of something from time to time She neglects no opportunity small or great it never scapes her provided she has any prospect of success  About that time the Court was very hot upon the execution of a project that had been proposed by several Persons a long time before I mean that of taking  Carthagena  where the Banks of several Nations were lodg'd as well as part of the Riches of  Perou  In the beginning of the  War a  Rochel  Man call'd  Petit  was taken up who had gone to  Holland  and there abjur'd his Religion upon the perswasion of his Wife and after her Death had return'd to  France  He was well vers'd in SeaAffairs and having been imploy'd by the  Dutch  orders were given to take him Dead or Alive Mr  Vilette  a LieutenantGeneral at Sea was imploy'd to execute the Orders and indeed he once made up so close to him that he thought to have given a good account of him But  Petit  being on Board of a better Sailer than any of the LieutenantGeneral's Ships he luckily got off tho some time after he deliver'd himself into the Hands of the Governor of  Vallenciennes  who gave notice of the same to the Court In regard he return'd with a resolution to reassume his wonted Religion and Obedience and had spoke so to some People who had acquainted the Ministers with it they could not handsomely indite him but contented themselves with securing his Person in the  Bastille  that being thought necessary for that after such an escape as his 'twas to be feared he might do the like again if ever he fell into the Hands of such a Woman as his first Wife was His Imprisonment was a great surprizal to him However having time enough in Prison to think of his Concerns he bethought himself that he would never be set at Liberty unless he attoned for his Crime by some great piece of Service Having considered again and again of the matter and being well acquainted with the Coast where  Carthagena  lies he lit upon the same Thought as others had before him He was of Opinion That 'twas not impossible for the King to make himself Master of that place and even ofwhich is yet Richer and as it were the Magazine of all the Riches of  Perou  Having hatch  d this Thought his next business was to  give it vent for which end he asked to speak with Mr  Besmaux  Governor of the  Bastille  But whether the Governor thought the Man was troubled with maggoty Fancies or whether he had no mind to be himself an instrument of losing his Prisoners by whose maintenance he got a great deal and for that reason called them his Pigeons Whatever was in it he would not allow him Paper to express his Thoughts upon but only promised to speak of his Project to a Mininister of State Tho' after all 'tis very likely he did not that for 'tis plain that if he had Mr  Pontchartain  who had the management of Marine Affairs was too good a Servant of the King's to neglect such a proposal as that The Prisoner receiving no Answer notwithstanding the Governor's Promise to bring him one cut off the Margins of a Book that he had and having made some Ink of Soot or Charcoal wrote down his Project together with several other things that then came into his Head He had not well finished his Scheme when Marshal  Tourville  came to the  Bastille  to try some Cannon of a new invention The Cannon were fired into the Ditch which the Prisoner observing through the Grates of the Chamber threw out his Paquet well wraped up It fell at the Marshal's Feet who haveing time to read the Superscription  viz To Marshal  Tourville  upon Affairs of great consequence relating to the Sea This Pacquet to be delivered to Mr  Pontchartrain Having read I say this Superscription he refufed to deliver it to Mr  Besmaux  who ask'd it of him The Governor indeavour'd to perswade him to it by setting forth That a Minister whose time was so precious ought not to be disturb'd with idle Whims that probably there was nothing in the Pacquet but such Vapours as the damps of a Prison are apt to excite and that for his part he was teaz'd  every day with such things but that he never minded them Mr  Tourville  looking up to the Window where the Pacquet fell ask'd him who was in that Chamber Mr  Besmaux  made Answer That 'twas a  Rochel  Renegado without telling his Name But the Marshal knowing that  Petit  was Prisoner in the Castle and taking that to be his Apartment told the Governor that since the Pacquet came from so good a place he was obliged to give it to Mr  Pontchartrain  Accordingly he gave it to him and that Minister having perus'd it found some things in it better explain'd than in the other Memorials that had formerly been given in upon that Subject Then he let the matter sleep for a while in order to digest things more maturely and at last spoke of it in private to some SeaOfficers that he thought capable to resolve some Doubts he had upon that Head Some of them represented it as impossible and others as a very dangerous enterprize only Mr  Pointis  spoke of it as an easy thing because he wanted to be imploy'd in the Expedition One must be prepossess'd with an expectation of success in any Enterprize in order to go through with it Accordingly in several Conferences between that Minister and  Pointis  the latter appear'd still more and more forward and removed several Difficulties that the other look'd upon as very considerable So great an itch had  Pointis  to signalize himself in that Expedition But  Glory  was not the only motive in his view he had another that weigh'd as much with him tho' it was not altogether so Honourable He was in Love with President  Ferrand's  Daughter and neither of them having any Estate in the ardour of his Passion to enjoy her he thought no Wall whatsoever would stand before him Mr  Pontchartrain  perceiving that he was the Man he wanted and that he could never find another  that would carry on the Enterprize with so much heat Upon this consideration I say he gave him a Promise of being imploy'd upon that Design  Pointis  recounted the Affair to his Mistress and among many other sweet words told her That she should have the Triumph of that Place that for his part all his Ambition was to lay at her Feet all the Riches that the Expedition should afford and that he accounted himself but too happy if by that means he could procure her favour While he was thus taken up in Courtship Mr  Ponchartrain  went effectually about the business There being a necessity of an infinite sum of money to answer the Charge that His M  jesty was at upon other accounts He had a mind that this Expedition should cost the King nothing With this view by the King's permission he erected a Company which advanc'd the money for carrying on the Expedition upon Condition of receiving the Profits that should accrue by it some put in a thousand Pistols some more some less the Fleet was got ready and Mr  Pointis  put to Sea when no body knew where he was going The  English  thought he had a design upon their Possessions in  Carolina  and gave the necessary Orders to prevent it The  Dutch  were apprehensive of a design upon them However Mr  Pontis  fell in upon  Carthagena  all on a sudden when the  Spaniards  least expected it and Landed there some Soldiers that he had brought with him At the same time the Governor of St  Domingo  being acquainted with the Design brought some Buckaneers to assist at the Siege  Pointis  stood much in need of them and without them he had never compass'd his end But they were so dissatisfied upon the small share they had of the Booty that they first complain'd to him and then threaten'd openly to send some body to Court to demand justice of him He laugh'd both at  their Complaints and Threats fancying that his success would procure him a hearing to their prejudice There was an immense quantity of Riches in that City both in Bars of Silver Golddust and pretious Stones And he did not neglect his own Coffers no more than some Captains of Ships whose Avarice was more notorious than his own For on Board of one of them there was found Effects to the value of eighty thousand Crowns he having converted the money into Goods which he was afterwards oblig'd to convert into money again Others were likewise convicted of having endeavour'd to enrich themselves upon the Company's Charges while it was only suspected But since Malice and Calumny is very forward especially upon such things for which every Man is believed to have a good Appetite 'twould not be just to be positive in the Accusation In that City there was a Young Man who was the Son of the Governor of  Lima  and by his Folly had a mind to furnish those who vented Romances with Truths instead of their ordinary Fables He was seiz'd with a Passion of Love for the Princess of  Conti  the King's Daughter upon seeing her Picture which fell accidentally into his Hands by an Engagement with the  Buccaneers  He found it in the Arms of one that was Kill'd and presently took it into his own as being a Treasure that he esteem'd more than the Pearls and Diamonds he had found among the Spoil Never were such Follies committed as that young Fool was guilty of after the sight of that Picture every day he kissed it a thousand times and he never ingaged without invoking it before hand as the only Deity that could assist him  good Fortune he had he imputed it all to it which enlarged his esteem of it more and more But at last being overpower'd in an Eng  gement with a King in the Neighbourhood of  his Father's Government the King as barbarous as he was lov'd the Picture as passionately as he As soon as he cast his Eyes upon it he ask'd What Picture it was and would have snatch'd it from him Upon that he threw himself at the King's Feet conjuring him to take his Life before he robb'd him of his Picture The Conqueror seeing him in so humble a Posture took pity of him and offer'd to let him keep his Picture provided he gave him to know the Original The Young Gentleman reply'd That he could not satisfie him upon that point because he did not know himself whose it was And with the same Breath acquainted him how it came into his Hands and offer'd to get it Copy'd The Prince was so much taken with the Beauty of the Picture that he caus'd several Copies to be drawn from it These he order'd to be hung up in the Temples of his false Gods in order to adore the Original which he thought could not be so pretty unless she were Divine The Young Gentleman having thus sav'd his Picture was afraid of losing it at  Carthagena  when Mr  Pointis  took it Fancying that all the World were as great Fools as he and the Prince that made an Idol of it The first Compliment he made to Mr  Pointis  was That by the right of Conquest he was Master of all that he had but as for that Picture he would part with it and his Life at the same time Mr  Pointis  was so much dazzl'd with the prospect of the Riches that lay before him that he had forgot every thing and even Madam  Ferrand  and thus having other things in view than the Picture he gave him to know that he might be easie and what Pictures he had a mind for were those of the King of  Spain  and other Princes engrav'd upon Gold and as for the Pictures of Women he would quit them for a trifle 'provided they were only valuable  for their Beauty or good Painting This Promise put the Young Gentleman in good Heart And Mr  Pointis  having cloy'd himself with the Plunder of the Town had the curiosity to look upon the Thing that occasioned the  Spaniard  's Sighs for he gave deep Sighs every minute which made people believe that he was a very p  on  te Lov  r He shew'd Mr  Pointis  the Picture upon his making Oath that he would not f  ll in Love with it As soon as Mr  Pointis  saw it he knew it to be the Princess of  Conti  's and  he knew the Lady and that his Love was fixed upon a very deserving Object The Young Gentleman pressing him to tell who the Lady was he could not deny his Request Upon this Discovery it had been very unhandsome in such a Lover as this not to go to  France  Accord  ngly he intreated Mr  Pointis  to let him have a place in one of his Ships Mr  Pointis  having promised him that Favour did not make him stay long  he set Sail but tho' the SeaAir c  ld the Gentleman's Passion for his Mistress the Admiral round himself in a greater quandary than the Gentleman An  English  Squadron much stronger th  n his own having notice that he was still  Carthagena  stood towards that place in order to dispossess him of the Riches he had p  llag  d The Governor of St  Domingo  who had  to his Government and was not w  ll pleased with the Usage that he and the Buc  eers h  met with did nevertheless give him Advice of their Design because it concern'd the King's  nterest Mr  Pointis  made such good use of the Intelligence that he weigh'd Anchor and avoided the  English  and at last arriv'd at  Brest  fter having s  ap'd several Storms and other troublesome Accidents  Before his arrival at  Brest  several Accidents happen'd both at Sea and Land The most considerable Occurrence at Sea was Mr  Nesmond  's falling in with three  English  Ships homeward bound from  India  They made a tolerable Defence but being unequally match'd  i e  three to six they were taken All the three were richly Laden and Mr  Nesmond  having put Mr  Montchevreuil  with one  Bene  an  Irish  man both of 'em SeaLien tenants on board of one of these Ships these two plotted together to defraud the Owners of the Prize while nobody minded 'em Accordingly they secur'd all they could and shar'd some Diamonds and other valuable Goods equally between 'em But Mr  Montchevreuil  's Indiscretion in spending at  Brest  much more than his Incomes could afford quickly discovered the Intrigue His Father allowed him nothing and all he had was a Pension of one thousand Livers and his Equipage Upon this Intendant  Begnon  smelling the matter gave notice of it to the Court His Interest at Court might have prevented his Arrest if Mr  Begnon  's Intelligence had not been put out of all doubt by his imprudence in setting out his very Footmen with the best Mus  ins he had taken in that Ship  Bene  indeed acted more prudently and it was not long of him that the thing took Air But Mr  Montchevreuil  's imprudence carried it so far that they were both taken up  Bene  who had not so much Interest as the other could not get off notwithstanding the Wisdom of his Conduct  Begnon  wrote him a thundring Note concluding in these few words  You are happy in having Mr  Montchevreuil  for a Partner in your Robbery Assure your self that if you were by your self I would have ca  s  d you to be Hang'd in forty eight Hours  At the Mari  es interceeded on his behalf because he was a good Officer but forasmuch as the one could  not be indited without the other they were both clear'd after five or six months Imprisonment But after all if all the Thieves had been Hanged  Bene  had got more Company than Mr  Montchevreuil  For at the Sale of these Prizes which amounted in Gross to Livres a great many things were transacted that were not very fair Those who had a mind to 'em gave a large Present to the persons that were empowered to adjudge 'em to prevent their being sold by Retail pursuant to the desire of those who were interess'd in the matter But whatever the Present was they lost nothing by it for at  Nants  they sold the Goods by Retail at three Millions profit  In the mean time the Archbishop of  Paris  imploy'd his utmost endeavours to make good the Character the King had procur'd him by giving him that rich Benefice Tho' his Brother's Fortune might have done something for him yet he did not owe his Preferment to that but only to his own Merit While he was Bishop of  Chalons  a See that he had before his accession to that of  Paris  he always acted up to the Office of a Holy Prelate To continue the same course of Piety that he had always follow'd he made Head against Vice And accordingly one of his first Edicts after his accession to the last See was levell'd against the Masquerades an Abuse that in earnest ought not to be suffer'd among Christians What a strange preparation is the Commission of a thousand lewd and foolish Actions for the Repentance that ought to be Preach'd up in  Lent  The Emperor extirpated this disorder at  Vienna  under the sole pretext of the War with the  Turks  Nobody was there allow'd to disguise themselves and even SchoolBoys were not allow'd to do it with impunity However the Archbishop not using the same pretence to sink that disorder at  Paris  but that of the Love and Gratitude we owe to God for shedding his Blood for us upon the Cross had not the same success as the Emperor had at  Vienna  If he had had recourse to the King for the putting his Edict in execution perhaps the fear of displeasing that Monarch would have gone farther than the fear of God But whether it was that he did not speak of it to the King or that the King had some Reasons of State for not minding him there was as many Masquerades that Year as if there had never been an Order against 'em The Archbishop finding he could not compass his design bent his Thoughts upon another Disorder that wanted as much to be remedy'd I mean the Debauchery of Women that was got to such a height that no Language can reach There was always two Convents at  Paris  for shutting up these Wretches and two Societies have been since Erected for the same purpose by the Care and Charity of some Vertuous Ladies In these Societies they are far from being used so severely as at the  Magdalonnettes  and  Filles Repent    where the Whips are  o far from freeing a So  l from Vice that on the contrary they make 'em regret that they cannot continue their past course of Life We must not pretend to translate a Person all on a sudden from Vice to Vertue especially by Correction for that ought to be effected by degrees and rather by Perswasion than by Force This gentle method was used in these two Societies one of which is call'd St  Isidore  and the other  Bon Post  ur  The latter had this peculiar Custom that they forc'd none to come among 'em All the Actions of that House were answerable to its Title The Girls that repented of their Lewdness or were afraid of falling into it came thither of their own accord and were entertain'd there as long as they pleas'd and their  Governantes  either  procur'd 'em some Place in a Person of Quality's House if they were fit for Service or got 'em Husbands if they lik'd that better When they desired to be gone they were suffered to go tho' 'twas to be fear'd they might return to their Vomit This Society and this Custom is still kept up and all pious Persons of what Condition soever not only visit these lost Sheep that are thus return'd to their Flock but likewise Eat with 'em very often This they take to be a more effectual method as indeed it is to reclaim them than that of letting Dogs loose upon 'em And 'tis for this reason that the House is entitl'd  Bon Pasteur The good Shepherd  for the  Good Shepherd  who properly speaking is the Son of God did not scruple to eat with  Publicans  As for the Daughters of St  Isidore  they were not used so very gently as those of the  Bon Pasteur  but kept a sort of a Medium between these and the  Magdalonnettes  The Archbishop whose Province it is to take Cognisance of all that passes in that sort of Houses knowing that these liv'd under a Director whose Doctrine he suspected would have taken them from him But they stood by him with some warmth and the more they shew'd their zeal to keep him the more the Archbishop pressed to put another in his place At last they told him freely That if he put in another they would not receive him and that they would rather disperse than comply with it Now they had liberty to disperse for they were not settled there either by the King's Letter or an Order from the Court of Justice Accordingly perceiving that the Archbishop was immoveable and fully resolv'd to subject them to his Obedience they actually dispers'd for which the Archbishop was blam'd by a great many especially by those who were not acquainted with the reason that had oblig'd him to do as he did  At that time Mr  Verthamont de Villemont  dyed who was the only Man that perhaps made the King depart from his wonted Moderation He was Master of Requests and making use of the Authority he had among the Gownmen both by his Place and by the numerousness of his Relations and Friends did what he could to Ruine a Gentleman of the Name of  Servon  that had been his Neighbour in the Country  Servon  being Related to Mr  Perefixe  Archbishop of  Paris  had recourse to him who engag'd to protect him after he found that Magistrate so proud of his Interest that he openly contemn'd both his Friend and him  Verthamont  finding that the Archbishop had declar'd against him and that he had imbark'd in that Cause for the sake of some Interest of his own form'd a design against his Life and alledg'd that he had a Love int  gue upon that side On the other hand the Archbishop form'd a design against his Life Thus th  rais'd between 'em the greatest Suit that had  en seen for a long time and the Cause being  ought before the Council the King himself a  d at the Decision which Mr  Villemont  who knew his Integrity and Justice was not pleas'd with The Archbishop being sensible that his Honour was very much touch'd by the Accusation prefer'd against him by that Magistrate and that 'twas not enough for him to maintain that it was an Imposture as it was but to prove it to be such upon this view I say he desir'd him to condescend to the Circumstances of the Fact in order to his Conviction Accordingly  Verthamont  advanc'd That on such a Day at such an Hour in such a Year and at such a Place he had an interview with a certain Lady whom it was well known he had formerly visited with some sort of Familiarity Now Mr  Perefixe  was at that time at  Rhodes  of which he was Bishop before his Accession to the See of  Paris  and for fear  Verthamont  should retract and throw his mistake upon the weakness of his Memory he pretended at first to make but weak Defences in order to make the other maintain his Forgery with more Impudence This  Verthamont  did not fail to do for fancying that the whole Court was on his side the Answers being so frivolous he insisted on the Charge because the Archbishop had summon'd him to declare whether he adher'd to his Accusation or not He likewise condescended to a great many particulars of matter of Fact which seem'd probable The Archbishop finding him engag'd so far that he could not afterwards retract desir'd to be allow'd to prove himself  Alibi  This was the best method he could take  o justifie his Innocence and retort the Calumny upon his Adversary The Court could not refuse to hear his Proof so he prov'd not only by Witnesses but likewise by an Order he made as Bishop that day which was Publish'd throughout his Diocess he proved I say that he was above one hundred and fifty Leagues off from the place of the alledg'd Interview  Verthamont  was strangely surpris'd when he saw himself thus Convicted However as all Litigious Men have some back Door or other he alledg'd That indeed he was out as to the Year but as to the Fact it self and the Day he was certainly in the right But after what was past that Reason would not bear So that he was not only order'd to make reparation of the Prelat's Honour but he and his Posterity were declar'd uncapable for ever of enjoying any Magistracy The Sentence contain'd likewise o+ther Punishments against him which 'twere too tedious to insert here However fancying the King would be so good as to dispense with part of 'em he had the boldness to appear at the King's Levee some days after The King was  incens'd when he saw him and commanded him in har  h words to depart his Chamber  Verthamont  obey'd without staying for a second Order and was even oblig'd to retire to the Country for the King would not allow him so much as to continue at  Paris  The Plenipotentiaries continued still at  Reswick  and it being uncertain whether the Peace would be concluded or not new Edicts were issued forth One of 'em oblig'd the great Cities and Towns of the Provinces to take Lanthorns like those at  Paris  and to buy themselves off by a Tax to be laid upon the twentieth Penny By that Edict the King promis'd in consideration of that Tax to be at the charge of the Lights for ever In fine 'twas visible that this was only a new invention for raising of Money which was much wanted at that time Mr  Caumartin  Intendant to the Finances was order'd to carry the Edict to the first President in order to have it convey'd to the AttorneyGeneral who read it with the coldest Humour of any Man in the World Mr  Caumartin  expected that when he had read it he would give him his Sentiments of the matter which he meant to Communicate to the Minister of State But the Magistrate continuing silent for some time he turn'd the Edict over and put it several times into the Hands of the Magistrate who still return'd it At last being tired with shuffling it to and again he broke silence and said It was a fine Edict and that he and his Friends ought to be convinc'd that it was such At least said he for my particular satisfaction I expected you would have done me the honour to tell me in whose Head all these Lanthorns were first projected Upon this Expression Mr  Caumartin  could not refrain from Laughing and imparted the occasion of Laughter to his Friends After all the Case was laid before the Parliament  and no one had the same curiosity as this Magistrate had  The Conferences at  Reswick  did not divert the King from sending puissant Armies into the Field By vertue of the Peace of  Savoy  he was Superior in force to his Enemies and part of his Troops that had serv'd in  Italy  he had transported to  Catalonia  In this Province he was still Master of the Cities of  Roses  and  Gironne  with some other Places of importance and had a free access to  Bar  lona  which is the Metrapolitan of that Country and in a manner the Barrier of the  Spanish  Monarchy This City which is Rich Great well Peopled and the ordinary Residence of the Nobility of that Country is situated on the Mediterranean and has a very considerable port upon that side The opposition that the House of  Austria  had hitherto made to the Peace mov'd the King to Besiege it He thought that if he could take it he could at least bring the  Spanish  Branch to reasonable terms considering that after that even  Madrid  itself was not secure His Majesty wrote his Thoughts of this matter to Mr  Vendome  who commanded the Troops in that Country This General sent him word that the Troops he had there were not sufficient for so great an Enterprize and that it could not be compassed with less than fifty Thousand Men Now at that time he had s  arce  wenty five Thousand But His Majesty having ten Thousand more ready upon a Call comm  nded him to make preparations for the Design and promis'd to send 'em to him when he wanted 'em After such positive Orders Mr  Vendome  had nothing else to do but to concert all measures for satisfying the King The  Spaniards  having already taken the Ala  m at the loss of their other Places in that Province and perceiving that the King meant to possess himself of that Place sent their best Troops  thither The Queen of  Spain  being the Empreses's Sister desir'd the Emperor to send some Regiments under the pretence of preserving that Province But that was not her main Design She had a greater eye upon the interest of ArchDuke  Charles  her Nephew for her Husband having no Issue and being not very healthy she had a mind to secure to him the Crown that  Philip  IV had bequeath'd him by his Will Pursuant to this design she had brought some  Germans  into the Council in order to stifle the Artifices that  France  and even some  Spanish  Grandees might set on foot either for the interest of that Crown or for their own for there were some of 'em that laid claim to the Blood of the Ancient Kings of  C  stile  and others to that of the Kings of  Arragon  These  German  Counsellors acted in concert with her and the Emperor sent 'em Instructions to the end that nothing might be concerted contrary to his Interest or that of the ArchDuke his Son In the mean time His Imperial Majesty sent the Troops that were desired and it being much his Interest not to lose  Barcelona  he intreated the  English  and  Dutch  to send a Fleet into the  Mediterranean  He was very sensible what was likely to happen because the King made new preparations in  Provence  and seem'd to have nothing so much in view as the Conquest of that Place However his Intreaty did not come so very seasonably whether it was that the  English  and  Dutch  had occasion to employ their Ships elsewhere or which is very probable that they thought the taking of that Place would so humble the House of  Austria  that they would not oppose the Peace any longer for they did not much trouble their Heads upon the matter  While preparations for War were made not only in that Country but in all the other seats of War a new War broke out in the Church  which might have caus'd great disorders if it had not been quickly stifled indeed it might have been sooner stifled if the Archbishop of  Paris  and the Bishop of  Meaux  had not been very complaisant to a certain Gentleman that I shall call by his Name by and by by which means it took deeper Root than it might have done To understand this matter throughly 'twill not be improper to carry our account of things a little higher In the Popedom of  Innocent  XI a Priest call'd  Molinos  started up at  Rome  who taught very uncommon Doctrines and did not want followers Among many erroneous Doctrines this was the greatest That when the Soul came once to a certain point of Sanctity it was not capable of sinning and then it had no part or concern in the Actions of the Body 'Tis a standing Maxim that we ought not to censure a Man's intentions especially when his Morals are unculpable as to outward appearance and for that reason I shall be very cautious of saying that this new Sectary under the pretence of so great Purity conceal'd a great many Disorders that his Enemies have falsly charg'd upon him Perhaps he meant that the Soul cannot controul some Infirmities that we are subject to from our Mother's Womb And provided these are detested by her she is not accountable for 'em before God Were it so nothing could be objected against his Doctrine for such is the Doctrine of the Church and what St  Paul  teaches us who was continually tempted notwithstanding his being one of the greatest Saints in Paradise However since a great many uncouth Consequences might be drawn from his way of explaining himself both upon this Article and many others the whole Church rose up against him  Rome  in whose view the thing happen'd Arrested him and his Case being brought before the Inquisition he was there Condemned  by such Commissioners as were appointed He submitted himself to their Censure and some Years after died in Prison Upon which 'twas generally thought that this new Heresie known by the name of  Quietism  was so far from passing the  Alps  that it died outright with him But the Case was quite otherwise For not only  Italy  was stuffed with his Errours but even  France  itself was tainted with them One Madam  Guy  a  the Widow of Mr  Montargis  who after the g  tting of a great Estate upon the Canal of  Bria  e  left her with two Children This Lady I say minded nothing less than the true Education of her Children Not that she wanted either Wit or Judgment nay on the contrary she had a greater share of both than what is natural to Wo  en or what herself ought to have desired For she meddled with what did not become her and shoving her No  e into Books pretended to explain not only the Fathers but even the Scripture it self In fine having heard of  Molinos  and his Herefie she could not be easie till she had  Copy of his Books and canvass'd 'em all over Malicious People will tell you that she approv'd of 'em to cover some Enormities that were charged upon her In the mean time she fell in with a  Barnabite  a  Sav  yard  by Nation who resided in a Convent belonging to that order at  Montargis  She made him her Confessour in ordinary and her Confident and having pour'd her Venom into his Bosom compil'd a great many Books either with his help or without it so as to make the same Figure in  France  that  Molinos  had done at  Rome  Mean while she ought to have been apprehensive of his  ate for tho' the Inquisition has not the same  ooting in all Countries yet she was not ignorant that the venting of a new Doctrine was a disallowable Action She dispers'd her Books among the Convents and several other places and the Abbot  of  Fenelon  the Gentleman whose Name I promised not to forget finding them of a piece with his Sentiments approv'd 'em secretly This he durst not do publickly by reason that he was made  Subpraeceptor  to the Children of the Royal Family and that the discovery of this his Approbation would not only cut off his arrival at a Bishoprick but dispossess him of the Post he was then in However Madam  Guyon  's Writings being publish'd began to make a noise in the World and in regard that the advances contain'd in 'em incourag'd all the periods of a dissolute Life or at least made way for very odd consequences upon this Consideration I say the Bishop of  Meaux  as well as the Bishop of  Paris  who was then only Bishop of  Chalons  undertook to make her sensible of her Error They had Conferences upon this Head with the Abbot of  Fenelon  whom they deem'd to be tainted with the same Doctrine He on the other hand justify'd her Assertions and maintain'd that her Thoughts were Just and Orthodox tho' the Meaning and Explication that they forc'd upon her was Heretical He likewise spoke up for her Morals and the Conduct of her Life which he pretended to be particularly acquainted with tho' both the one and the other were much suspected  The warmth he shew'd in justifying her confirm'd the two Prelates in the Thought That the Doctrine he vindicated was as much his own as hers They told him as much and he on the other hand did not deny it but had the submission to assure 'em That he would willingly change his Mind if he were convinced of the Error To this purpose an Assembly was held at  Issi  but before they met Madam  Guyon  had given in to the Bishop of  Meaux  a Copy of all her Writings in order to be examin'd at his leisure The Bishop examin'd it with all possible Care and likewise  was at the pains of inspecting the Conduct of her Life for some time by which means he discover'd that she inflamed the Evil by pretending to Authorize her Doctrine by Miracles and a Gift of Prophecy bestow'd upon her by God She recounted Stories to this effect pretending to confirm 'em by credible Witnesses and in a word never did Woman or Man carry Fanaticism so far as she did In fine there was cause enough for putting her up in  Bedlam  if it had not been for those who supported her All the Abbot of  Fenelon  's Friends were hers the Duke of  Beauvillers  Governor to the Princes of the Royal Family was suspected to be an Abettor of her Errors as well as the Duke of  Chevreuse  and their whole Families The thing that confirm'd the general suspicion of the Duke  de Beauvillers  beyond the rest was the putting his eight Daughters into a Convent at  Montargis  'Twas concluded from thence that  Montargis  being the place where this Heresie was first hatched in  France  that Convent being a Convent of  Benedictines  was likewise tainted The whole Family of  Charost  was suspected in like manner of falling in with this Heresie But that which restrain'd scrupulous and nice Consciences from Condemning it at a time when they were very sensible of its pernicious Consequences was That neither the Court nor  France  itself could boast of Persons of such Christian Lives and Regular Morals as all the Favourers of the new Doctrine were of Their Piety was not of so late a date as the Heresie of  Mo  in  s  that Madam  Guyon  Reviv'd From their first appearance at Court they were all eminent for Vertue and 'twas in consideration of that that the King chose to put the Children of  France  under the Government of the Duke of  Beauvillers  He had been thirty Years a Courtier and during that space of time had never counter acted  the Measures of Vertue which shin'd in all his Actions and in a word no Man could be in greater esteem at Court than himself So that when the Publick saw him charg'd with the Abetting of this new Doctrine they look'd upon the Charge as Invidious as well as Zealous They put this construction upon the matter that the Post he was in created him private Enemies who wanted to succeed him and stood at nothing to compass their End  Whatever was in it the Abbot of  Fenelon  who always shewed a disposition to obey what Decision should be made at  Issi  joyned with Madam  G  yon  in singling out a third Person who would cast the Ballance upon the side he declared for if the two Bishops who were to meet should be of a contrary Sentiment The Bishop of  Meaux  pretends in a Book he has lately published That all this was carried on without the King's knowing any thing of the matter This I am willing to believe because he said it And I likewise believe that the reason in his view was to prevent the King's having an ill opinion of the Abbot of  Fenelon  His Majesty being an Enemy to all new Opinions not only out of Piety but out of Policy since nothing is more apt to disturb the Repose of a State than Innovations in Religious Matters The third Person I mention'd but now was Mr  Tronson  Doctor of the  Sorbonne  Superior of the Seminary of S  Sulpitius  a Man of sound Principles and one whose Life and Conversation were blameless Before the Assemblies met the Abbot of  Fenelon  had time to Compile a Vindication of Madam  Guyon  's Books but notwithstanding all his Precaution they were Condemn'd with one general Voice Madam  Guyon  had promised to submit to the Judgment of these three Doctors as well as the Abbot of  Fenelon  And both of 'em seeming to submit these Judges  thought the Matter was laid asleep tho at the same time the Fire was only smoother'd under the Ashes The Abbot of  Fenelon  had a mind to be a Bishop before he kindled it again And in effect he was no sooner Install'd Archbishop of  Cambray  but he return'd to his Vomit notwithstanding that he had invited the two Prelates that Contemn'd his Doctrine to assist at the Ceremony of his Consecration However he went on with a great deal of Precaution pretending that the Sentence pronounced against him was only owing to a misunderstanding of the true Sense of the Books under Examination He gave high Encomiums of the Vertue of that Lady which at that time began to be more warmly attack'd than before for 'twas alledg'd She had only reviv'd  Molinos  's Doctrine for a Cloak to the disorderly things she was charg'd with Madam  Guyon  for her part was so far from a true Submission to the Censure of those Judges that she began again to Write a Vindication of her Doctrine The Archbishop of  Cambray  who pretended all along to keep in with the two Prelates that had Condemn'd him as if the Allegations he had made on the behalf of the Lady and her Principles were such as they would have joyn'd with if they had been fully acquainted with her Person and Doctrines This Prelate I say made a counterfeit Censure of the liberty that the Lady took in setting Pen to Paper again At last the King was inform'd of the Matter but so that nothing was said against the Bishop of  Cambray  either because they had a mind to try if they could gain him otherwise or because they fear'd his Plot was so well contriv'd that he would come off clear notwithstanding all the Testimony they could bring against him Madam  Guyon  was Imprison'd at  Vincennes  by the King's Order As the Mind of Man is always curious and fond  of Novelties so her Books were sought for every where insomuch that there was not half enough for those that wanted 'em This Lady had a Daughter that was married to the  Count de Vaux  the Eldest Son of the late Mr  Fouquet  Superintendant of the Finances He was Brother to the Dutchess of  Charost  and being troubled at the Imprisonment of his MotherinLaw as indeed he ought to have been He left no Stone unturn'd to procure her release The Abbot of  Fenelon  did the same thing under hand 'Twas represented to the King that she herself would condemn her own Advances if she thought they imported what was alleg'd against her and that she was so far from meaning any such thing that she thought herself oblig'd to take up her Pen again to undeceive the World but since His Majesty was displeas'd with her Writing she would take care not to transgress his Orders for the future In fine her Resolution to submit to the Doctrine of the Church was so dextrously represented to the King that he condescended to set her at liberty upon condition that she should retire to a Convent just by  Paris  where her Conduct might be more narrowly inspected Thither she went and behaved herself for some time so well that 'twas really believ'd she was wean'd from her Errors In the mean time this thing having made a great noise the Bishop of  Meaux  resolv'd to publish a Book to undeceive those that might favour the New Doctrine He communicated his Design not only to the Bishop of  Chalons  who was then made Archbishop of  Paris  but likewise to the Bishop of  Cambray  He gave the latter to know that he hop'd he would affix his Approbation to the Book which he desir'd both out of respect to him and for enforcing and recommending it to the World He represented farther That there was a general Report that he had favour'd that Lady  and that by this means he would shew to the World that tho' he once thought well of her yet he did not subscribe to her Errors The Bishoy of  Meaux  alledges That he promised his Approbation and that after this interview they parted good Friends This he avers openly in a Book of his that's but just Published However the Archbishop of  Cambray  went some days after to visit the Archbishop of  Paris  and acquainted him that he had a mind to write upon that Subject himself but would not put his Book to the Press before he knew his Sentiments of it The Archbishop of  Paris  endeavour'd to dissuade him from pursuing his Design and remonstrated to him That the least partiality to that Lady's Tenets would infallibly ruine him The other reply'd That he might easily imagine he had no mind to Print any ill thing since he offered to shew it first to him But this Answer did not please the Archbishop of  Paris  He continued his utmost endeavour to take him off from his Resolution but at last finding he could not prevail he desir'd that at least he should not Print his Book till the Bishop of  Meaux  had Published his The Archbishop of  Cambray  promis'd not to do it and the Archbishop of  Paris  thinking he would keep his word acquainted the Bishop of  Meaux  with what he had said In the mean time he expected a sight of the Manuscript and indeed the Bishop of  Cambary  sent it to him but it was writ in such an abstracted manner that the first time he read it he could understand little or nothing of it In that Manuscript he set forth That if the Doctrine of the Quietists consisted in the belief of such and such things he was ready to Condemn it but if it maintain'd such and such things he was ready to vindicate it Thus was his Book divided into several Chapters some containing a description  of the Quietism That all Doctors ought to reject and others of the Quietism That as he alledg'd all the World ought to approve of The Archbishop of  Paris  who had not much time to peruse it being much taken up in the exercise of his Episcopal Office thought he might keep the Manuscript as long as he would especially considering that the Archbishop of  Cambray  had promis'd not to put it to the Press till the Bishop of  Meaux  's Book was Published But he would needs have it again and the Archbishop of  Paris  gave it him after he had shewn him two or three Chapters that he thought proper to be lick'd over again But after all this Book was Published before the Bishop of  Meaux  's and the Author having thus broke his word to the Archbishop of  Paris  fell out both with him and the other Prelate The Bishop of  Chartres  joyn'd with them in representing to the King the pernicious Consequences that would insue upon the toleration of that New Doctrine His Majesty having spoke of it to the Archbishop of  Cambray  that Prelate pretended to maintain that he had said nothing in his Book but what was conformable to the Tradition of the Church and that he was willing to refer the matter to  Rome  and submit to their decision The King not being qualify'd to judge of these things himself was oblig'd to strike Sail to such a plausible submission But the other three Prelates being still at his Ear remonstrated to him That 'twas not proper for the Royal Offspring to be under the Conduct of a Man that was so notoriously suspected of Heresie This gave His Majesty such an Alarm that he ordered the Archbishop of  Cambray  to retire to his Archbishoprick In the mean time the Cause was transferr'd to  Rome  as being the only Tribunal capable to determine a Question of that Nature Each of the Parties endeavour'd to  make Friends in that place Mr  Bossuet  sent his Nephew thither who by the Interest he had beyond others might be capable to put his Orders in Execution The Archbishop of  Cambray  sent likewise a Person that he confided in tho' his greatest hopes depended upon Cardinal  Bouillon  who was his particular Friend He order'd him to prolong the Affair as much as possible that he might have time to set things in a clear light and to give His Holiness to understand that the opposition he met with proceeded more from a party concern than from a Religious Zeal In the mean while Madam  Guyon  's Principles were found in the Royal Abbey of St  Lewis  at St  Cir  and a discovery was made that some Nuns were so influenc'd by 'em that they were downright Quietists Madam  Maintenon  was mightily troubled at this she being the Person to whom the Nobility of  France  owes the Erecting of that Religious House in which they have the opportunity of being rid of their Daughters for a time and sometimes for ever And what troubled her yet more a Nun that was her particular Favourite was one of the poyson'd number However the King transplanted 'em to other Convents to prevent their infecting of the rest This Sect which had been extinct at  Rome  from the Condemnation of  Molinos  began to revive there when the Abettors understood that it still had footing beyond the  Alps  and even that an Archbishop had openly declar'd himself a Protector of it Such was the conformity of their Sentiments with his that they cry'd up whatever he advanc'd and tho' they did not know him and indeed had scarce ever heard of him yet the whole City was presently fill'd with several Writings in which they not only applauded his Doctrine but made an infinite number of  Panegyricks  upon his Person as if they had been intimately acquainted with him The Archbishop  of  Cambray  being acquainted with all that pass'd at  Rome  by an Express he had sent thither did not nevertheless confide so much in them as to abstain from Writing himself For he sent 'em several Papers by way of Letters in which he explain'd the Objections made against his Book in order to rectifie the consequences that might be drawn from thence In the mean time nothing was said to Madam  Guyon  nor to the Archbishop's Friends that were about the Children of  France  Among these was the Abbot of  Beaumont  his Nephew to whom he had procur'd the place of being Subpraeceptor to the young Princes and who had always acted up to the Duty of his Post In regard 'tis natural for a Nephew to adhere to his Uncle and that the obligation he had receiv'd from his Uncle suggested a Presumption that he would not easily depart from his Interest the King was sollicited to disgrace him 'Twas represented to His Majesty That the Young Princes were not safe under his Conduct no more than under his Uncle's and that tho' he had not publickly taken up with his Errors yet 'twas to be fear'd he might suck in their Contagion The King thought it an unjust thing upon a simple suspicion to turn a Man out of his Post that could not be convicted of any Crime He was resolv'd to see farther into the matter before he would condescend to any such thing Thus was he continued in his place and his Enemies were forc'd to wait for a more favourable opportunity to ruine him  While the Bishops were thus making War one with another two Ecclesiastick Orders were reconcil'd that had not always liv'd in a good understanding I mean the Jesuits and the Priests of the Oratory who upon several occasions have demonstrated to the World that they are not always of the same Opinion The Doctor of St  Martha  a Person of great Merit distinguishing Piety and profound Learning was turn'd out from being General of the Priests of the Oratory by the intrigues of the Jesuits supported by the late  de Chanvallon  Archbishop of  Paris  To pry into what was done in that Society the Jesuits as well as the Archbishop had got a false Brother there who gave 'em notice of every thing so that nobody could imagine how the discovery came for he was so disguis'd that he was taken for the greatest Zealot of all the Brethren An Archbishoprick was promis'd him in recompence for his Service and the Good Fathers were as good as their word in due time that is when they found another of their Society that promis'd to perform what he did The conferring of a Bishoprick upon this Traitor rais'd a suspicion in that Society but since it might be attributed to something else than the true Cause that was not enough for a true Conviction At that time the Traitor of St  Martha  was not yet depos'd he continuing his steady Course quickly observ'd that there were Traitors among them tho' he did not determine whether the Bishop or another However that Bishop being removed from thence the simpler sort of People looked upon that as a vindication of him tho' the more sensible part of Mankind did not excuse him the more for that They fancy'd what was true that he had given his Place to another who would be equally zealous upon the prospect of the like Recompence They were in the right of it for they did nothing but what the Archbishop and the Jesuits knew However they did not trouble themselves being sensible that they did nothing but what was to be done In the mean time the Doctor of St  Martha  had occasion to have some business with the Archbishop and one day when he had his Audience that  Prelate put him into his Closet till he had finish'd a Conference with a person upon a business of Consequence As soon as the Doctor enter'd the Closet he spy'd upon the Table among other Papers one that he knew to be the Hand of one of his Priests and having the curiosity to know what it was found it to be an account he gave the Archbishop of a thing that had been privately concerted among them This Paper he put in his Pocket thinking the Archbishop would not perceive that 'twas he that took it and carry'd it home after finishing the Affair he came upon Immediately upon his return he consulted with those of his Society that he knew would be faithful in keeping the secret whether or not he should shew this Paper to him that wrote it Some were against the shewing of it because that would give the Archbishop to know that 'twas he that took it but others thought this no inconveniency nay on the con  ary they thought they were oblig'd to shew that they knew both the Traitor and the Treachery The Father joyn'd with the last and accordingly took aside the writer of the Paper that was then in his Pocket and check'd him for what he had done The writer offer'd to deny the Fact fancying that he spoke only by suspicion Then the Father of St  Martha  advis'd him in a Christian manner not to add a Lye to his former Fault and withal acquainted him that he knew all the particulars for which reason 'twas in vain for him to offer to disguise any thing The treacherous Brother was of the same Humour with those who when once they have advanc'd a thing could rather see it cut in peices than lop any thing of it For in pursuance of their Temper he insisted still upon the Negative But the General not being able longer to bear his impudent Lying produc'd the writing out of  his Pocket and prov'd the Charge against him by his own hand Writing The Traitor was mightily surpriz'd at the appearance of the Paper having then nothing more to say all his reserve was to cry out upon the Archbishop for ruining him entirely by giving his Paper to the General The Archbishop made Oath that it did not come that way and well he might since it was discover'd as above However the Archbishop smelling from thence that the Father had snatch'd up that Paper when he was in the Closet advis'd the false Brother not to be concern'd for that he would procure the Royal Protection for him in case his Society offer'd to affront him In effect the Society of which he was a Member design'd to expel him but the Archbishop prohibited them in the King's Name to think of it so that he continued among these Priests and does to this day In the mean time the Archbishop could not forget the Trick that the Father of St  Martha  had plaid him That joyn'd with other things gave the Archbishop an opportunity of representing him to the King as a Jansenist and imploying the Royal Authority to depose him Father  de la Tour  the present General of that Order was elected in his room and deserv'd that Post upon several accounts especially by reason of his singular Piety and distinguishing Zeal The Jesuits oppos'd his Election under hand alledging That he was as much a Jansenist as the Father of St  Martha  Several things were offer'd towards his justification but that very thing that was design'd for his further Ruine prevented his exclusion He was Confessor to one Madam  de Fond Pertuis  that was a zealous Devotee to Mr  Arnaud  insomuch that she went to  Flanders  several times during the last War This new General having advice of this prohibited her to return to  Flanders  again unless she chose another  Confessor But she did not stand to go thither once more in spite of his order to the contrary However he did not offer to enquire further into her Conduct but the thing being heard of at Court the King saw plainly that he was not so much a Jansenist as he was represented  to be in regard he censur'd that Lady's adhering to one that was reckon'd the head of that Sect Thus was his exclusion prevented and the Jesuits finding what a good Opinion the King had of him invited him to P  ch a  a solemn Festival in the Church of St  Louis  He return'd their Complement by desiring them to single out one of their Society to Preach before the Priests of the Oratory upon the day of another solemn Festival Thus was the Reconciliation brought about that I spoke of but now But after all I doubt if the Jesuits were cordial in the matter for this General had for some time indeavour'd to stifle their Practice A great many Ladies of Quality that us'd to confess to Father  Bourdaloux  or some of their Society desir'd that he might be their Director Among others the Dutchess of  Aumont  deserted them and put in with him And this being a Practice that seldom passes with impunity among Directors would have eterniz'd the Quarrel between the two Companies if the Jesuits who have fully as much Policy as Learning had not thought it proper to take no farther notice of it At this day Father  de la Tour  Preaches in their Church but as he is not equal to many of 'em either in Gracefulness or Eloquence so they did not stand to give him the precedency as to the Direction of Consciences because he for his part was oblig'd to stoop to them in the way of Preaching Madam  Harlai  the Plenipotentiary's Lady had become one of his Penitents ever after she had the happiness to be convinc'd that it was impossible to work her Salvation in this  World if she liv'd as most Women now a days do But being as fond of Gaming as ever her Husband could be particularly of  Lansquenet  which is as bewitching as  Bassette  insomuch that when Women are once seiz'd with a Passion for it they'll rather sell their Smock than abstain from it This Lady I say being such a passionate Lover of that Game that 'twas to be fear'd she might relapse into her old vomit by frequenting publick Company every day This Director gave her four of his other Penitents to have an eye upon her These Spies reliev'd one another under the pretence of keeping her Company and she was the less sensible of the Design because they were all four much of her Age and Condition One indeed was of a higher Birth than she as being the Widow of a Son of the BlueRibbon one of whose Ancestors had been a Marshal of  France  For notwithstanding that the Lawyers have a great value for their Character especially when their Magistracy gives as great a distinction as the Family of  Harlai  is possessed of yet 'tis certain that there's a great deal of difference between th  Gown and the Sword when the latter is attended with distinguishing Circumstances This Lady had been the Marchioness of St  Valeri  As for her own Family she was a  Bullion  that is to say the Daughter of the Marquis of  Mon Lovet  a Marquis indeed of a late standing but of a golden Nobility for he was the Son of Mr  de Bullion  Superintendant of the Finances who left three Children among which the descendants of the Eldest were only capable to keep his Riches as for the other two their Posterity has no resemblance of the Superintendant that was once in their Family they are as poor as Devils and the third of these Children commenc'd his misery in their Life time by making an unlucky Marriage He fell in Love with his Mother's Woman  and Married her upon whch his Mother disinherited him After he had quench'd his Passion with Enjoyment he quickly became sensible of his Fault but 'twas then too late to think of a Remedy However being very much troubled for the loss of such a fine Succession he left  Lions  where he was wont to live and came to  Paris  having first instructed his Wife in what she was to do towards the backing of his Design The Orders he gave her were to go into the Country and spread a Report in the City that she was at the Point of Death Now it being customary in all places to inlarge Reports as they spread the whole City of  Lions  was presently fill'd with the noise not only of the Lady's sham Illness but even of her Death Her Husband who had been hitherto frustrated in all his attempts towards the regaining of his Mother's Favour knowing how cases stood at  Lions  went into deep mourning and so repaired to St  Eustache  where his Mother commonly went He cast himself as 'twere accidentally in her way and she seeing him in such a Garb had the curiosity to inform herself under hand of the Reason of it for she would not speak to him herself Her followers being perswaded that his Wife was Dead told her what they heard of the matter upon which she gave her Son's Relations and Friends to know That forasmuch as the occasion of the difference between her and him was gone she would not keep Anger longer She invited him to come and see her and the Deed by which he was disinherited being tore he found ways and means to retain her Friendship insomuch that she not only pardon'd his Marriage but likewise his abusing of her Credulity in making her believe that his Wife was Dead  Madam  Harlai  's three other Keepers were the Attorney General's Lady Madam  Harouis  and Madam  Chateaurenard  This last was the handsomest of all the four but had not been always so devout as they for she was mightily taken up in the way of the World But the disgrace of her Husband's Family with some other melancholy Circumstances that are not uncommon in the way of Life oblig'd her to pursue a course that might screen her from all disquiet so that she became so very pious that her Piety was a pattern for those who had grown old in the pursuit of it before ever she thought of such a course of Life Her Husband was the Son of the late Mr  Dacquin  the King's first Physician who not being satisfied with the Estate he had occasion'd his own Banishment from the Court by importuning the King with unseasonable Requests Nay he was so bold as to represent to His Majesty that his Services were at least equal to any that could be done of what nature soever and in effect that since his Life was to him the most precious and dear thing in the World 'twas an obvious consideration that the person who preserv'd it by his Prescriptions was not be despised Before he ventur'd upon such Discourses that is while he observ'd the measures of Respect due to His Majesty both he and his Family had a thousand liberal Gifts conferr'd upon 'em His Majesty had made his Eldest Son Secretary of his own Closet and an honorary Counsellor of the Parliament a favour that is not promiscuously granted and besides all this he was Intendant of the Generality of  Moulins  When this Honour was conferr'd upon him he was scarce twenty five Years old But immediately upon his Father's beginning to talk so high he was included in his Father's Disgrace and recall'd The Name of  Chateaurenard  which he bore was the Title  of an Estate he bought from Mr  Amat  the Son of a famous Farmer of the Revenues This  Amat  who scarce understood his Interest so well as his Father discover'd upon his first imbarking in the World that Gaming was his only delight and upon that score several Sharpers Courted him in hopes to have part of the Riches left him by his Father Among others an Ensign of the LifeGuard had  pretty good success for he won of him a large sum in ready Money and another upon tick But that sort of Commerce being the King's aversion and the Ensign being better vers'd in shuffling the Cards than in unsheathing his Sword for the King's Service Upon these considerations he was broke when His Majesty purg'd the Companies of their scandalous Members The abovementioned Estate belonged formerly to a very good Family of that Name It had once a Castle upon it that serv'd to overawe the  Burgundians  when they were under the Dukes of  Burgundy  who were the greatest Enemies that ever the Kings of  France  had notwithstanding that they had the honour to spring from their Blood The Heir of that Family having done something in opposition to the King's Interest his Estate was forfeited and reunited to the Royal Demesnes The Family of  Chatillon Coligni  whose Possessions were adjacent to that Estate bought it of the King as lying conveniently for them and kept it a great many Years till  William  Prince of  Orange  Married  Louise de Coligni  the Daughter of Admiral  de Coligni  who bears so great a Figure in our History by which means it pass'd into the House of  Nassau  and there continued till the Princes of  Orange  the present King of  England  's Mother sold it as her Son's Guardian to Mr  Amat  Farmer of the Revenues At this day the Arms of the Princes of  Orange  are placed in the most eminent part of the City if it be allowable to  call a Place a City that is only a Hole and that one of the most wretched Holes in the Universe But let it be as it will the Inhabitants of that Hole or Town call it which you will thinking to ingratiate themselves at Court in the beginning of the last War by setting forth their hatred of King  William  intreated the Marquis of  Louvois  by a Letter to allow 'em to take down these Arms But such a Request deserving no Answer that Minister gave 'em none and thus were the Arms preserv'd from their mistaken Zeal so that they stand to this day where they were plac'd an Age ago  At that time the Bishop of  Dax  Died and his Death robb'd the publick of his History of the King which he was carrying on upon the precedent of Mr  Perefixe  's History of  Henry  IV He thought it became a Bishop to undertake that sort of performance But after all if he had employ'd his time in finishing the History of the Church begun by Mr  Godeau  that Province as I take it had been more suitable to his Character However he search'd every corner for the finding of Memoirs to answer his Design And not long before his Death I saw him come to one of my Friends that had belong'd to Cardinal  Mazarin  to know of him whether the late King of  England  was present at the Negotiation of Peace carry'd on by that Minister with  Don Louis de Haro  in Upon his departure my Friend acquainted me with the occasion of his Visit which was to me a mighty surprisal for that all the World knows that  that  Prince would have been there but that his Eminence would not allow of it The Reason he went upon was That he fear'd the disobliging of  Richard  the Son of  Cromwel  who had been declar'd Protector of  England  after his Father's Death So that  that  Prince who had advanc'd within six Leagues of the place where  the Conferences were held was oblig'd to return My Lord  Bath  whom he had sent to know if his Presence would be acceptable receiv'd this Answer That 'twas not proper for him to appear there and that the abovementioned Minister would still take the same care of his Interest But had the Prince been so simple as to trust him and take no other measures he had been in a fair way of never mounting his Throne The Bishop I mention'd but now had resign'd his Bishoprick a great while ago perhaps in order to have the more leisure to pursue his History 'Tis probable he thought to outdo  Racine  or  Boileau  but I question if he should have succeeded If his Talent lay that way I must say that it was a hidden one for he was never found to be capable of doing much  Had the Marquis of  Rouville  who was eighty Years old died as he did he had not sustain'd so great a loss because he had not any History upon the Stocks but instead of Dying the old Gentleman acted the part of a very Lively Man and one that had no mind to die so soon He commenc'd a suit against his Relations who mean'd to interdict him under the pretence that he was very old and having always been an ill Husband there was no hopes of his growing better in his old days Had the late Prince been still alive and sate as his Judge he had not only given it for his Adversaries but order'd him to be Imprison'd for he us'd to say that if there had been two  es  in  France  he would not scruple to leave it for his Lifetime His meaning was That he was the most troublesome Man in the World which was also the Opinion of a good many People who in imitation of this Prince did not satisfie themselves with Trifles He chose rather the Condition of one of his own Men in a  Corner at  Chantilly  than to be oblig'd  to hear such an idle Fellow speak nor did he stand to say that he was far less uneasie with his Pullets and the other Creatures that he kept in his Managry and visited twice a day than he would be with Men of his Character Yet it was a strange manner of Occupation for a Prince so famous for having gain'd so many Battels and whose very first Essays in War had equal'd the Actions of those that grew old in the Trade The Enterprize of  Barcelona  was still in hand as well as the design to have the Prince of  Conti  chosen King of  Poland  and the Court was exceeding diligent to bring both the Affairs to a happy Issue The one was indeed more easier than the other tho' both appeared very hard at least there was some reason to judge the latter more easie than the former because all they had to do was to spare no money to make it succeed they were only to gain the Votes of those who are always for the highest Bidder for as that is the Harvest of the  Poles  who reap nothing when they have a King upon the Throne so it is long since they own'd their resemblance of the  Swiss  in regard nothing is to be done with them without money The Prince of  Conti  had sent thither already two hundred thousand Crowns of his own and the King for his part who would have reap'd a great advantage by obtaining that Crown for the Prince sent fourtimes as much Abbot  Polignac  the King's Ambassador at that Court distributed the money amongst those he had engag'd in his Party and taking that Election to depend intirely upon Cardinal  Radzionwski  Archbishop of  Gnesne  who by virtue of this last Dignity was Prince and Regent of the Kingdom during the vacancy of the Throne  lavish'd his money upon him while he thought it sufficient to feed others with fine Promises But the Generals of the Army of the Crown and the  Lithua  ian  Troops  who were equally sharp set with the Cardinal did not find their Account in that sort of management neither were the  Palatines  satisfied forasmuch as they thought their Swords deserv'd to be considered no less than the Cardinal's Mitre Abbot  Polignac  had disguis'd his Project for a long time and made the Queen  Dowager  of  Poland  believe that the King his Master had only put up the Prince of  C  nti  by way of Provision in case there were no other in whom he could confide Besides that the Prince of  Conti  was veryindifferent upon the matter and if he consented to it 'twas rather to please the King than to gratifie his Inclination So far he said well and that Prince who was passionately fond of  France  was afraid of nothing more than to hear that he was elected King of  Poland  But as for His Majesty he was of another mind for he desir'd nothing more earnestly than to see the Crown upon that Prince's Head by reason of the advantage he expected from thence The Queen  Dowager  being like most people easily perswaded to believe what she wish'd gave credit to the insinuations of Abbot  Polignac  She took a great deal of pains to justifie to him her Conduct in what she had done for several Years against the King's Interest and gave him to know that His Majesty had for  'd her to it by his ill usage and that whenever His Majesty pleas'd to alter his measur  s with reference to her she would really shew that she d  r'd nothing more than the restoring of the good understanding that had been betwixt the two Crowns in the beginning of the Reign of the King her late Husband She continued to repre  rt That i  His Majesty would vouchsafe his P  ction to Prince  James  her Son whom she mean  d to prefer to the Throne as soon as he a  vd at that Dignity he should do every thing in  with His Majesty's pleasure and  that His Majesty ought not to fear that the Alliance he had concluded with a suspected Family would oblige him to counteract his Interest that he knew well that Princes have but little regard for their Wive's Relations at a time when either their Glory or Grandure are in view and that her Son would continue in an inseparable Union with his Crown insomuch that he would put the Service of His Majesty upon the same ballance with his own  These words were very acceptable to the Abbot of  Polignac  who knew that a Reconciliation between two Parties is the more sincere when both sides are eager in justifying their past Conduct Nay he pretended to have some sense of the justness of her Complaints against the King in order to insinuate himself more effectually into her Breast In fine he agreed with her to transfer all the Votes for the Prince of  Conti  to her Son and upon that consideration she promis'd to use her utmost efforts in taking off  Sapieha  great General of  Lith  ania  from the House of  Austria  the Interest of which he seem'd to espouse very warmly  Sapieha  was extream powerful in that Dutchy and was rather Master than General of it possessing vast Territories and great Charges in it which was the reason that every one trembled under him The Abbot of  Polignac  had no other design in it but to weaken the party of the House of  Austria  flattering himself with the Thoughts that Prince  James  his Party would never be able to make Head against his own for he was very far from thinking to keep his word to the Queen and all he said to h  was only to the end he might the more easily deceive her Nevertheless she was so credulous that to assure him the better of the Confidence she had in him she sent him her Picture which he seem'd to have desir'd very earnestly He set it up in the most conspicuous  place of his Chamber to make her the better believe how much he esteem'd it However that Princess acted nothing but in concert with him She endeavour'd to take off  Sapieha  from the House of  Austria Sapieha  did not deceive her in the least He told her freely That he was so engag'd in the Interest of that Family that there was but one thing that could oblige him to quit it and that was to have the Crown set upon his own Head and that it was in her power to contribute to it if she pleas'd That she should only joyn her Interest with that he could make for himself which if she pleas'd to consent to he would infallibly set her upon the Throne with him for that he being a Widdower and she a Widdow nothing could hinder them from Marrying The Queen  Dowager  however earnest she was to Reign did not at all relish that Proposal She knew  Sapieha  's Spirit who tho' he would have kept his Promise to her yet would hardly have allow'd her the very shadow of the Kingly Power while he himself would manage the whole without Controul She had had already two Husbands over whom she had always a great ascendant and now she did not pretend to degenerate in the least from what she had always been tho' she was passed the time of inspiring any new Flames  The House of  Austria  in imitation of that of  France  caus'd the Ministers which they had at that Court to act so secretly that it was impossible even for the most clear sighted to pry into their Conduct There was hardly any one who did not believe that their design was to advance Prince  James  to the Throne The honour▪ he had in being BrotherinLaw to the Emperor and the King of  Spain  confirm'd them in their Thoughts However that House had quite a different inclination They mistrusted the Queen of  Poland  whose Actions they were no strangers to and knowing that she had sent Money into  France  they look'd upon her as a Woman that had been always inclin'd that way They knew that the  French  have always a secret inclination for their Country which never dies but with their last Breath Besides they knew that Princess had a certain ascendant over her Son that would assure her of the Reins of the Government if ever they set the Crown upon his Head However all these Reasons were more than sufficient to oblige the Emperor and the King of  Spain  to prefer their own Interests to that of their BrotherinLaw who was a Prince upon whom they could not rely very much for he was far short of the qualities of the King his Father They cast their Eyes upon a Person very worthy of that Crown The Duke of  Saxony  a young Prince who had distinguished himself to a great degree in the Wars the Emperor had against the Infidels and whom he had set at the Head of his Army seem'd to both of them to be the Man His Imperial Majesty labour'd to remove a difficulty that oppos'd their design The Duke was of the  Lutheran  Religion and ever in some measure considered as the head of all that Party because it was one of his Ancestors that afforded a Retreat to  Luther  and who after having embrac'd his Doctrine undertook also his protection against the Emperor who pretended to have him punished because he dar'd to Preach a New Religion It is truly astonishing why his Imperial Majesty and the King of  Spain  would not rather endeavour to chuse the Duke of  Bavaria  who was SoninLaw to the one and Nephew to the other he being also a Catholick which was a necessary Quality for the King of  Poland  Besides he was much Richer than the Duke of  Saxony  and that is no mean quality to be considered in a design of that Nature But  whether that Elector was altogether indifferen  or whether the two Princes judged it necessary to continue him in the Government of  Flanders  they fix'd intirely upon the other Duke The Emperor propos'd the matter to him and told him that it should only be long of his Religion if the Affair did not succeed▪ The Duke found the thing of too great a Consequence to determine suddenly However charming the proposition was he consider'd the Condition they annexed to it was too weighty for him He demanded some time to give his Answer and the Emperor judged that because he listned already all would have a favourable Issue if he press'd him never so little He began to infinuate to him that both the first  Calvinists  and  Lutherans  had always believ'd that one might as well be sav'd in the Catholick Religion as in Theirs and that the Crown they propos'd to him was certainly well worth all the trouble they asked of him and at the same time made him converse with a number of Doctors that pushed the Affair a great deal further and alledg'd a great many Reasons to prove that the Catholick Religion was the only true Religion and that which had been always profess'd in the Church  The Bright lustre of the Crown of  Poland  made the Duke relish their admirable Reasons and some Ministers who conferr'd before him with these Doctors tho' neither the one nor the other knew to what purpo  e all this was doing agreed that according to the Explication the Catholicks make now adays of their Faith it was void of all manner of Venom so that the Duke was more than half perswaded to go all the length they desir'd of him The Catholick Doctors hearing the Ministers speak after that manner That the Prince might harbour no further scruple in his mind alledg'd that nonehad ever  explain'd their Faith after any other manner than what they do at present excepting some sort of People that were glad to make others believe some different Thing that one might only read the Council of  Trent  to know the truth of it and that all those of their Religion had no other Doctrine than such as was taught there The Duke was glad that they prepared for him the way he desir'd being inform'd by the Emperor that his Intrigues in  Poland  were so strongly laid that his Enemies would find it hard to overturn them There was nothing that diswaded him so much from making a profession of that Religion as the fear that his hopes would prove abortive Accordingly being a Man of precaution he promis'd to the Emperor to perform all they desir'd of him upon the proviso of the certainty of his Election Now this assurance that he demanded was a very difficult Point because it depended upon the Votes of a great many People that were capable of falsifying their words The very Bishop of  Cujavia  tho' he headed the Interest of the House of  Austria  shew'd no great resolution in determining who he should Vote for notwithstanding he had already taken of his Money He design'd to make use of that Election as a means to make himself a Cardinal and was sensible that whatsoever side was prefer'd he would meet with invincible Obstacsle to his pretensions The Bishop of  Passaw  waited only to see the Emperor's Success in order to make a Proposal for the succession to that Crown He being Brother to the Empress the Bishop of  Cujavia  was convinc'd that he would be too hard for him and that upon that score the same thing would be said to him that upon the like occasion was formerly said to the Coadjutor of  Paris  Cardinal  Mazarin  had formerly promis'd to invest him with the Purple upon the proviso of some things that were mutually concerted  but he forfeited this promise the Cardinal desir'd the Prince of  Conti  to procure the nomination of another The Bishop of  Cujavia  fearing and that very justly that the same thing might happen to him would gladly have gone over to the  French  side if he had not been jealous of the Abbot of  Polignac  whom he took to be of such a Temper as not to give up the pretentions he equally made to the Cardinal's Cap In this quandary he caus'd some to feel his Pulse to try if he would quit his Pretentions but the Abbot being as fond of the preferment as he thought his request very indiscreet and neglected the King's Interest in carrying on his own In effect had he resign'd his Pretentions to this Prelate he had by that means joyn'd the Prelate's Interest to his own and had certainly procur'd the Election of the Prince of  Conti  But he fancied that by the Primat's Assistance and by the help of some Money he still expected from  France  he would compass his design without him  The Bishop perceiving how confident he was of his good Success since he despis'd his Offers which any other would have valued at a far higher rate than what he demanded of him endeavour'd to cast in some difference betwixt Him and the Queen of  Poland  He caus'd inform that Princess that she would be extreamly impos'd upon if she rely'd upon his Promises and advis'd her to have some better security of him than his word unless she had a mind to leave room for a future Repentance The Queen who was naturally suspicious resolved to make her advantage of this advice and that she might have the more confidence in  Polignac's  Expressions she desir'd that he might procu  e for her the King's Letter by which she might be assur'd of what his Majesty was pleas'd to  quaint  her by his Ambassador The Abbot put her in hopes of it designing to elude her whenever she urg'd him too close to make good his Promise In the mean time he wrote to  France  that Affairs went fairly for the Prince of  Conti  But if they design'd to make the success not only probable but infallible they should not  ail to send him a considerable sum of Money The Court of  France  was never in greater necessity than at that time having resolv'd to attack  Barcelona  they were equipping a strong Fleet in  Provence  that put them to a vast Expence Besides they were considerably exhausted to procure a Peace from their Enemies that at that time was so necessary to them all their Provinces were ruin'd by the War and tho' other States were hardly in better Circumstances yet they were affraid that the Subjects would scarce be any longer capable of bearing so heavy a Charge  They had been a long time resolv'd as is already mention'd upon the design of  Barcelona  in hopes that the  Spaniards  who alone with the Emperor oppos'd the Peace would change their Sentiments when they saw themselves attack'd even in the very Bowels For tho' that place be upon the Frontiers of  France  yet there being only two or three places of strength betwixt it and  Madrid  it was not doubted but that Conquest would Alarm them much more than the loss of four better places in  Flanders  But after all tho' these Reasons pleaded for carrying on the attack without any delay it was nevertheless put off for some time upon important Considerations The very Inhabitants of  Marseilles  oppos'd it's Bombardment in regard they had a great many effects in it which would have been lost if it had been reduc'd to Ashes They made a considerable Present to the Court to procure a due regard to their Interest But at last all the  Considerations that retarded the Seige  being taken away it was discours'd on more warmly than ever  This Enterprize could not be carried on without a great deal of Charge as I intimated before but the Court that is seldom sensible of the publick miseries and had a Minister that found the Mistery to raise as much Money as they pleas'd without overcharging the People thought that this ought not to hinder them from bringing their Enemies to a Compliance In effect the Provinces were rather miserable because they wanted Hands to labour the Ground than that they were overcharg'd by exorbitant Imposts So that His Majesty who was still full of Money notwithstanding all these immense Expences thought fit to satisfie the Abbot of  Polignac  in regard that he assur'd them there was nothing else wanting to make all have a prosperous Success So that he sent him not only the sum he desir'd but four hundred thousand Livers over and above that if he came to fail in his Negotiation he should not blame an unseasonable Parcimony The Queen of  Poland  seeing him receive so large remittances and distribute them according to the Cardinal's Advice found him very remote from her Interest and began to be extream jealous of his Conduct She had reason to suspect that he only thought to amuse her and as the esteem they had of the Prince of  Conti  in that Kingdom was far superior to that they had for Prince  James  her Son she began to press the Abbot upon the assurances of his Promise He shifted it by telling her sometimes that the King being now ready to begin the Campaign had no time to think of any thing else at other times that the King expected that if he brought over to the party of Prince  James  the Voices he had gain'd for the Prince of  Conti  she would be pleas'd to repay  him the Money he had sent into that Country for making the Party  The Queen's Council could hardly blame so just an offer but distrusting that it was only a pretence of the Ambassador's to delay Affairs advis'd the Queen to yield to him in that Article for if he meant to be ingenuous the Prince her Son could never fail of the Crown The Queen believed her Council and she herself communicated it to the Abbot but that Ambassador being now at a loss what to Answer thought fit to propose to her something concerning his own particular Interest He told her that during the life of the King her Husband he had the promise of the Court that if he got the Prince of  Conti  to be chosen King he should allow him to name whom he pleased for the Cardinal Dignity that he expected she would be pleas'd to stipulate the same thing with her Son that all his pains migh  not be fruitless That there were some Prelats in her Son's Interest who had the same pretentions in case he were chosen King and that he desir'd they might resign in his favour That Her Majesty ought not to take it ill that he should require this of her for perhaps in his Lifetime he should not have so favourable an opportunity to arrive to that honourable Dignity  As soon as the Queen's Council heard him talk after that manner they were the more confirmed in their Sentiments of him However to cut off all opportunities to make use of that difficulty they us'd their Interest with the Prelats that were of Prince  James  his Party to resign what the Abbot desir'd which they did in consideration of the promises the Queen had made to them and that Princess acquainting the Ambassador with it he pretended all went well and that all that remain  d  e done now was to reimburse the sums he  advanced o  which he had the Accounts readvly  by him Now He had not propos'd that as to be done presently all he desir'd before was That when Prince  James  should be chosen the Queen and He should be oblig'd to make that Restitution So all that were in the Interest of the Queen finding that he had only altered his Conduct the better to amuse her judged it expedient that Her Majesty should not only break off all measures with him but do it also very openly Their Reason was That as  France  had it's Enemies as well as Partisans the secret Union which they suspected she entertained with him hindred those who had openly declared themselves against  France  to imbrace her Interest The Queen believ'd them and after once sounding the Abbot of  Polignac  touching his last Resolution she made him sensible That she was no more of an humour to be amus'd She wrote a Letter also to the Marchioness of  Bethunes  to be deliver'd to his most Christian Majesty In it she complains of the Abbot's disengenuity and how uselesly he lavish'd the King's Money for however powerful he believ'd his Interest it was no ways capable to equal that of the House of  Austria  except they joyn'd it with hers This Marchioness was Sister to the Queen and both of them were Daughters to the Marquis of  Arquien  who was Captain of the Duke of  Orlean  's hundred  Swiss  and afterwards Cardinal by the Nomination of the late King of  Poland  The late Princess  Mary  of  Gonsague  had carried that Queen with her into  Poland  when she herself went thither in the same quality being Married to  Ladislaus  who then possess'd that Crown She had taken her for one of her Maids of Honour and the Prince  Lubomirsky  falling in Love with her as well as  Sobiesky  who was afterwards her Husband the Queen declar'd herself in favour of the first because he was by far the greater Prince of the two In the mean time  Lubomirsky  dying a little after and the Affairs of that Country proving unfavourable for  Casimir Ladislaus  his Brother who was chosen King after  Ladislaus  and had moreover Married his Widdow Queen  Mary  knowing that  Sobiesky  continued always his Affection for Princess  Lubomirsky  promis'd to procure her for him in Marriage if he would declare himself for the King her Husband Which he did and as he had already gain'd a great Reputation in that Kingdom his declaring himself was of vast advantage to  Casimir  However after a great many different Accidents that are foreign to my Subject  Casimir  dying without Issue as well as King  Ladislaus  his Brother and a  French  Prince making interest for the Crown as well as the present Duke of  Lorain  his Father the Bishop of  Marseilles  who was Ambassador for  France  in that Country seeing it go cross to the Interest of the Person whom his Master propos'd chang'd his Conduct very dexterously and told the  Dyet  That it was none of their business to Court their Neighbours for what they might easily find among themselves provided they were satisfied with it That  John Sobiesky  was a person very worthy of their Crown who would govern them with all the prudence and satisfaction that it was possible for any other Prince to do  Sobiesky  had beat the  Turks  in many Rencounters and even very lately had rescued the Republick from imminent Danger by a glorious Victory So that his fresh Services pleading more in his favour than it was possible for the Ambassador of  France  to do He was chosen King notwithstanding a former Decree of the Republick by which they excluded their own Subjects from the Crown  By these means the Queen of  Poland  of an ordinary  French  Girl became Queen However tho' her Birth ought to have oblig'd her to all  the Respect imaginable for the Crown of  France  under whose Government she had drawn her first Breath yet she very soon forgot it because His most Christian Majesty would not comply with all her desires The Marquis of  Vitry  Ambassador of  France  at that Court in the King her Husband's time pass'd his time there very uneasily and he miss'd been assassinated very narrowly because she suspected him to be the cause of all the Displeasure she received from the Court of  France  The King who made use of the Prince her Husband as a check over the Emperour and Empire was oblig'd to conceal his Resentment of that Princess her Conduct Matters were better adjusted by the moderation and prudence of His most Christian Majesty and by the secret Reflections that Princess might have had of her injustice to a Prince worthy to govern the Universe But as it is impossible always to dissemble ones Sentiments she soon made the breach between Her and His Majesty wider than ever For being by the Divine Goodness rais'd to so high a Dignity it vex'd her extreamly that her Father had no mark of Distinction in his Court She therefore intreated the King to create him Duke and Peet The Marquis of  Arquien  was a person abandon'd to his Pleasures and became so far a slave to them that tho' he was advanc'd to a great Age yet  Wise but plung'd into Debaucheries that  extreamly upon the honour of his Daughter and gain'd no Reputation to himself either as FatherinLaw to a great King or as a Man of Quality He avowedly kept his Miss whom he allowed to go by his Name for she was known by no other than by that of  Louison D' Arquien  and that coming often to His Maiesty's Ear he thought it not very convenient to grant the Queen the Dignity she demanded for her Father  That Repulse was resented with all the Malice Woman is capable of she obliged the King her Husband to discontinue all secret Intelligence with His Majesty and as the Emperor at that time was engaged in a Bloody War against the  Turks  she incessantly importuned him until he had concluded an Offensive and Defensive League with His  Imperial  Majesty The Almighty brought all that to pass for the relief of  Vienna  which the  Turks  had Besieged and beyond all peradventure had also been taken had not His  Polish  Majesty come to Relieve it However so lively and impatient a Princess could not but shew her resentment much more to the Abbot of  Polignac  because the present Affair was of far greater consequence than any thing that had passed formerly and the World saw by the violence of her Resentment that she would continue it all her Life She sent to him to have her Picture again and because he refused to restore it thinking still to amuse her she immediately sent the same Person that had formerly spoke to him to let him know That if he would not restore it in a friendly manner she would oblige him to do it by force The Ambassador who was sensible how she had treated the Marquis of  Vitry  would not run the risque of a second refusal He returned her Picture and seeing the Queen had broke off all measures with him he observed none with her but what her Sex and Dignity obliged him to In the mean time he distributed some small Money he had received among the Commanders of the Army of the  Crown  and of that of  Lithuania  They thought it convenient to refuse it but as all he gave them was not capable to satisfie their hungry Appetites so they were not the more oblig'd by it to comply with his Design  An Officer of the Army of the Crown who was the Elector of  Brandenburg  's Subject having  heard even those who received the Money vent their Railleries resolv'd to come and acquaint His Majesty of it at  Versailles  believing the King would certainly reward him liberally so quitting his Charge and leaving that Country expresly he passed through all  Germany  and arriving in  Holland  came to the Marshal  Bo  ffler  's Army upon the Frontiers of the  Spanish Flanders  The Officer of the main Guard having stopped him was inform'd by him who he was whence he came and in some measure of the nature of his Business and sent him to the Marshal to acquaint him of what he was not willing to declare there This Stranger did not know one Word of  French  but as he spoke  Latin  to perfection he made the General easily understand That he came from  Poland  and that he had Affairs of moment relating to that Country and this is all he would tell him as if the Marshal had not been worthy of his Secret The General seeing a Person of an ill mein that pleaded nothing in his favour but rather gave him an ill opinion of him was like to cause him to be taken up but considering he would do better to send him under a sure Guard to Court he put him into the hands of an Officer whom he order'd to take two or three Troopers for his  Escorte  The Officer went along with him to  Versailles  where this Man was reputed a Spy as soon as he offer'd to speak For after what the Abbot of  Polignac  had Wrote to them they were fully perswaded that the Affairs of the Prince of  Conty  went as well as they could wish in that Country they would not believe a tittle of what he alledg'd it being quite contrary to  Polignac  's Relation He told the Secretary of State to whom the Marshal had sent him That they were highly mistaken if they believ'd that the  Poles  would ever chuse that Prince for their King They ask'd him the  reason but he not being able to produce any other than that I mention'd but now it was reckon'd so bad a one that he was immediately sent to Prison They were resolv'd to draw up an Indictment against him but Mons  D'Argenson  who was employ'd to Try him being a Man full of Justice and Equity had no sooner examin'd him but he found it plain that all his Crime consisted in having thought to make his Fortune by bringing this News He reported the same thing to the Court and the Process against this pretended Criminal consisting only of an Interrogatory or two it was dropt till they saw how the Election of  Poland  would go  The Duke of  Saxony  thought it convenient in the mean time to make a faint show of the Catholick Religion without having the least inclination to it He saw that it was absolutely necessary for obtaining the Crown of  Poland  so having brought over to his Interest a Bishop of his own Family that was of that Religion this Prelate at the Emperor's sollicitation gave him a Certificate That he had privately Abjured  Lutheranism  This they shewed secretly to the  Palatines  that were in the  Austrian  Party who seem'd to have no other view in Corresponding with it than to advance Prince  James  's Election At least the World believ'd so and  France  was of that opinion so that they did not dream that ever that Elector had thought in the least of the Crown The Queen of  Poland  was impos'd upon as well as others the  Palatines  delay'd Affairs on purpose that they might be more courted and have the opportunity of filling their Purses The Elector was obliged to borrow Money from all hands to forward his Interest The Elector of  Brandenburg  lent him considerable Sums upon a Mortgage of the  Baillages  that lay convenient for him He likewise rais'd immense Sums in his own Dominions  upon the pretence that being in the Emperor's Service he wanted the assistance of his own People because it was not possible for the Emperor to pay the Subsidies they had agreed upon Moreover instead of making his Correspondence with the Duke of  Erandenburg  to appear he feign'd he was at variance with him upon the account of the Domains that both of them had upon the Confines of  Poland  and accordingly both of them march'd thither their Troops as if they design'd immediately to come to a Rupture  France  that had too many Enemies to deal with to be indifferent in desiring to get rid of at least some part of 'em was catch'd as well in this Snare as in the former They were willing to believe that this would not fail to make a powerful diversion in their favour and as it was impossible for some part of the  German  Princes to be meer Spectators in the Differences of these two Princes so they expected a considerable ease upon each side  The march of these Troops was very cunningly contriv'd and disprov'd with a witness what had been publish'd a while ago to the disadvantage of the  House of Austria  Some would have it that for many Years together that Family had been always Trick'd by  France  and that by observing only their ordinary Course as if there had been none else more ready and sure to forward their Designs they had so degenerated from the Wisdom and Greatness of  Charles  V that all  Europe  had forgot them but as they manag'd this Intrigue that was contriv'd at  Vienna  they were overjoy'd to know that  France  had lost its Pretensions to the  Title  While these considerable Affairs were transacting in  Poland  some other Matters pass'd in  France  of less consequence for the State but in which some particular Persons found themselves more interress'd  Paris  that had furnish'd the Scene for  that Lady who had met with so ill usage from her own Domesticks afforded also the following which is extraordinary enough to plead for some place in these Annals It appear'd to me so uncommon that I doubted for a long time whether I should insert it I was sensible that among so many certain Things as I here present you with I ought not to run the risque of Writing any that I have reason to suspect In fine this Matter has been confirm'd to me by so many Hands that if I be deceiv'd it must be because they took pleasure to impose upon me I receiv'd six different Letters from  Paris  that contain'd the same thing so that after all the Precautions I us'd I suppose that however extraordinary the Matter appears it may be credited after the enquiry I have made in it In effect if we should doubt of all the surprizing Things  Paris  affords we must necessarily doubt of all that happens there for every Day produces such Accidents as one would hardly believe without infallible Testimony  A Girl was forc'd to profess by the uncontrolable Will of Parents who by this means meant to take her off from the Inclinations she had for a Person they would not have her Marry notwithstanding she was shut up she always continu'd a Respect for him that troubled her extreamly in the exercises of her new Profession Her Lover for his part could never forget her but having seen her put on the Habit he ought to have laid aside all hopes of ever enjoying her Yet being always tormented with his Passion which was so much the more violent that while the Young Nun continu'd in the way of the World she gave him all the demonstrations of her Esteem that he could reasonably desire he robb'd his Father a Rich Merchant of Twenty thousand Livres in Gold Cloath'd himself in a Girl's Habit and went  to the Convent where she was after having hid himself for a whole Month in the City pretending to be Sick His first Compliment to the Convent was That he was resolv'd to become a Nun He told 'em he was come from the Country and was the Daughter of Parents that had made a considerable Estate by Trafficking and having shew'd his Treasure to these Nuns it secur'd him more in their esteem than any Profession whatsoever  So extream desirous were they to have it that they easily dispenc'd with inquiring any farther after the place of her Nativity or what Faults this disguis'd Girl might be liable to in her Youth They were satisfy'd for that she promised them the whole provided they would Maintain her while she Liv'd However she told them that they might not think she was ill natur'd That if she meant to let them have the whole Sum it was because she had no Relations in  France  That her Father and Mother who had come thither were originally  English  And thus having told them a thousand pretty Stories at length she concluded That she was a poor Orphan and would be very glad to lay out her Money to the best advantage or at least to secure herself from the Miseries of Necessity  This Relation of the pretended Orphan appear'd so ingenuous to the Hungry Nuns that they resolv'd to receive her into their Cloyster without troubling themselves with any farther inquiry into her Circumstances than what their Eyes could afford them into the goodness of her Coin However there arose a little difficulty betwixt the Parties for the Nuns desir'd to have the Money presently deliver'd up to them or at least when she assum'd the Habit but she for her part pretended only to do it when she Profess'd tho' she meant never to do it for she design'd her Mony for some other use than what the Nuns had ever  thought of And to that purpose told them That she could not be satisfy'd whether their Rules and manner of Life would suit with her Temper and till she was fully assured of that they ought to demand no other Conditions of her but that of paying handsomly for her Board which she would never scruple to do that in the mean time she would put out her Money to Interest which would fall to them in course whenever she had assum'd the Profession but that she intended to secure herself before she was stripped of her Money She demanded nothing but what was just and besides threaten'd to find out some other place if they refused any longer to accept of her Conditions Being afraid to slip the opportunity they agreed with her upon her own Terms So this pretended young Gentlewoman having put on the White Vail in a few days bestow'd so Liberally upon her Habit as if Money had cost her nothing All the Nuns were wonderfully edified by her generosity only her Mistress in the midst of all their Joy for so rich a Prize continued still in her wonted indisposition as if she had been altogether mortify'd The resemblance she found between herself and her Spark open'd her Wounds afresh that were still too tender not to be sensible of any thing that touched them  The Scene being thus over The Novice began soon to accost the Lady that oblig'd him to dissemble his Sex But being unwilling to entertain her in the Torment she was in she told her all of a sudden what  Love  had forced her to do she added moreover That she was fully resolv'd to Starve herself if she would shew her no Compassion That she was certainly inform'd she had assum'd the Profession against her Inclination and if she had yet any sense of the passion she had for her while with her Parents she had no reason to doubt but the  recent Testimony she now gave her would engage her to enter into all the measures she would advise her That she had fallen upon this Invention not to rob her of her Honour but to restore her to to the tranquility she had lost and to recover her own also That she could enjoy no more after she had enter'd into the Convent That she wanted not Money to carry them thorow in exp  ctation of a better Fortune and tho' the Sum was not of great importance yet she kn  w how to manage it to that advantage as would secure them from the Injuries of Necessity That she was fully resolv'd to Marry her if she pleas  d That it was certain her Vows were of no force since she was compell'd to them and so it depended intirely upon herself to be freed from her present Captivity since it was not possible for her to be happy without her That neither of them ought to regard the meanness of the Present she offer'd her now in comparison of what both of them could have reasonably expected if Love had not embroil'd them with their Parents That she would endeavour to be at ease without them and oftentimes there was more satisfaction in a middle ordinary F  rtune than in a sumptuous one That great R  ches are always attended with great Cares and provided that a Husband and Wife who love one another tenderly be out of the reach of Necessity they may be indifferent for other Superfluities  The Nun found this way of reasoning very pertinent▪ it  eing altogether conformable to her own Sense and Inclination She agreed with her Lover in all things They pass'd three Months in this Intrigue  doing nothing but what became the strictest Honour the there might have been some incroachments upon Decercy The Novice feign'd herself Sick alle  ging after they had asked her a great many times What she ail'd That her Sickness  proceeded only from the Austerity of the Convent which she could never be able to go through The Discreet Mothers were a little vexed to hear her speak after that rate forseeing that the twenty thousand Livers they had rely'd upon would slip out of their Fingers but there being no remedy they were fain to restore to her her temporal Habit and give her her Pass She presently took up her Money and gave it to the Bankers for Bills of Exchange upon  Italy  where she was resolved to pass her time as soon as she made sure of her  Mistress  Having mutually adjusted all things the Night before they put their Plot in Execution the Nun uninter'd a Sister that had been just Buried carried her to her Bed and having set Fire to it made her escape into the Garden of the Convent where her Spark had fastned a Ladder of Cords to a certain place of the Wall they had condescended upon He waited for her at the other side with a Coach and receiving her into it while the whole Convent was in an uproar about the Fire carried her to a Lodging he had intirely at his command  The poor Nuns had much to do to quench the Fire that frighted them extreamly for fear of having their whole Convent destroyed by it However having mastered it at length tho' with a considerable loss they all of them run immediately to the Chamber where the Fire first began and being extreamly troubled that she did not appear they doubted not in the least but she had perished in the Flames They were soon confirm'd in the certainty of their belief when they found the remnants of a dead Body in the ruins of that Chamber thinking really the rest had been consumed by the Fire Nothing was heard but Grief and Lamentation upon all hands some rehearsing the praises of the dead Nun whom they  thought they could never lament sufficiently Others who were as much interess'd as compassionate griev'd more for the loss of the House than of the Dead and while they amused themselves with these or such like Reflections not one of them dream'd of what had happen'd but the most probable thing they said was That her Parents when acquainted with her unhappy Disaster must needs Censure themselves in regard they had forced her to assume the Profession against her Inclination  In the mean time the two Lovers escap'd into  Italy  pursuant to their design There they were Marry'd having met with a Priest to their Mind or one perhaps so tender of their Interest as to ease a poor Girl of her Vows without giving her the trouble of applying herself to any other Authority than his own The young Husband applied himself to Traffick in which he was so fortunate as in twenty Years time to make a considerable Estate In that time Providence blessed him with a numerous Off spring but at length he died in the five and fortieth Year of his Age The Lady who was much about the same Age notwithstanding the tender Love and Prosperity of her Husband being still frighted with a check of Conscience resolv'd upon a Journey to  Rome  to obtain the  HolyFather  's Absolution for what she had done The  Pope  refused it absolutely without she promised faithfully to return to the Convent She was extreamly unwilling to comply in regard of the tender Affection she had for her Children In fine preferring the tranquility of her Conscience to every thing she conquer'd all obstacles that would have hindred her and promis'd His  Holiness  to obey his Command She had a favourable Passage by Sea into  France  together with her whole Family which she carry'd along with her to  Rome  to move  His  Holiness  to a Compassion for them When she arrived at  Marseilles  she took the way to  Paris  concealing from the World both Herself and her Affairs She lodg'd some time  Incognito  in the Suburbs of St  Germans  to dispose of her Family before she would withdraw into the Cloyster And tho' she had put her Affairs in order she would by no means go thither before she was assured of a civil Usage She was not ignorant of the terrible Penalty they were liable to that leap'd over the Walls of the Convent as she had done That she should not be exposed to it she offered underhand Twenty thousand Livres for her Pardon This Summ charmed all the Nuns Eyes which they looked upon as a Present sent them from Heaven They were mightily surprized at her Resurrection and acquainted her Friends with it who doubted a long time whether they ought to rejoice at it or shew her some Mark of their displeasure for wandring about the World with a Person upon whose account she had been forced to turn Nun As it was never seen that all the World was of the same Opinion so some continued their Indignation against her and would never see her others did not mind the matter so much But all of 'em agreed to have her stript of the Mony she brought from  Italy  pretending it was not in her power to dispose of it to her Children She secured it in a Person's Hands whom she had reason to confide in to have it divided amongst her Children whenever they should either Marry or establish themselves some other way in the World However they were not the only Persons who gaped after it her deceased Husband's Friends began also to bestir themselves upon the news of what had passed Both Parties commenced their Process against the Children pretending to have them declared Bastards So much for this extraordinary  Scene which in effect appeared in such a manner to me that I should never have had the confidence to have mentioned it here without having taken all imaginable Precautions with reference to it It is not very hard to conjecture what Decision Justice will make in it However it will hardly be soon determined The Judges are seldom very prompt in deciding Causes when the Parties are in Circumstances to dispense with Money They believe it would derogate too much from their laudable Custom to dispatch readily Affairs that afford Gleanings  The Court being about that time at  Marli  the Count of  Chamilly  was nam'd amongst others to go thither In a discourse of the War some young Gentlemen there took a share in the Conversation And the King ask'd the Count of  Grammont  softly how he liked the young Gentlemen's way of reasoning  Grammont  who has a pleasant freedom in all his Expressions being glad to make use of this opportunity to serve the Count of  Chamilly  who had been neglected for a considerable time answer'd His Majesty That he ought not to be surpriz'd at these young Men's way of reasoning for if any were at the pains to ask them if ever the  Grave  was Besieged they would say nothing of what had pass'd there nor who had defended the Place The King perceiv'd his Design which was to upbraid His Majesty that after so glorious an Action  Chamilly  had not been rewarded as others had who had not his merit to plead for them But it is no surprizing matter now adays to see Actions of Renown shot in their Carier Courage and Conduct doth not intitle a Man to a plentiful  Fortune  he must also be learn'd in the Art of  Truckling  to the  Ministers  The Marquis of  Louvois  was extraordinary upon this account and however highly he valued the  Good  and  Advantage  of the  State  which none  could deny to him yet to serve the King faithfully was no sufficient Character to recommend one unless he were his Creature Without that nothing would do it was his constant Maxim that it was impossible to be His  Majesty  's Friend without being the  Ministers  I shall neither justifie nor condemn him there is a great deal to be said on both sides His Majesty who without dispute is the most sincere and prudent Prince in the Universe took this occasion to do  Chamilly  all the justice that could be expected So that those who were entirely Strangers to the Siege of the  Grave  as the Count of  Grammont  pretended might easily be inform'd of all that pass'd there  In the mean time the  Spaniards  being alarm'd at the Preparations the King was making in  Provence  acquainted the  English  and  Dutch  afresh of i  to the end they might send their  Fleet  into the Mediterranean to make Head against the King's These two  Powers  being full as weary of the War as  His Most Christian Majesty  for that no advantage could accrue to them by continuing of it amused them from time to time with fair Promises without troubling themselves to perform them They thought it convenient to allow  France  to act its utmost Efforts upon that side that the House of  Austria  might become the more tractable and oppose no more a  Tranquility  of which all  Europe  stood in need The  Pope  made use of his Interest in vain to draw over that  House  to it so great was their confidence that  France  would at last be oppressed by so many Enemies as were United against it The Duke of  Savoy  's falling off gained nothing upon their obstinacy tho' it eased  France  very sensibly The  Pope  could never offer his Mediation to decide the Quarrel most of the Parties interessed being of another Religion In fine the  Swedish  King accomplished  what His Holiness could never bring to pass He made the  Parties  agree to accept of him as  Mediator  of their  Differences  The Castle of  Ryswick  was named for the  Place  of their Congress tho' the Emperor opposed it upon several accounts They endeavoured to accommodate Matters in an amicable way which was exceeding hard to do considering the Exorbitant Demands of the House of  Austria  These insisted always upon the Restitution of all they had lost since the Treaty of the  Pyrenees  and had no regard to the two later Treaties of  Aixla Chapel  and  Nimiguen  alledging They had only been obliged to make them by a superior  Force  to avoid the utter Desolation of their  States  The Duke of  Lorrain  for his part demanded the Restitution of his  Domains  without any regard to the Conditions that were agreed upon by the Treaty of  Nimiguen  which seemed so insupportable to his Father that he chose rather never to enter into the Treaty than accept of them upon these Terms A great many other Princes came also to thwart it who demanded Reparation of the King for a great many Places and Villages that they alledg'd he had divested them of insomuch that  His most Christian Majesty  might have been compared to the Bird in the Fable from which all the other Birds his Enemies meant to pluck a Feather  It had been very hard to redress all these Confusions if the common Misery had not obliged the  English  and  Hollanders  to remove the Difficulty it had like to have proved a GordianKnot where the Sword is more necessary than Art But as these two  Powers  to speak properly were the very  Life  of the Alliance that had no motion but from this  Spring  they asked the  French  Plenipotentiaries at  Ryswick  if they meant to stand to the Preliminaries that were stipulated with Monsieur  Calliers  otherwise it were to no purpose  to Meet but if they intended faithfully to perform what was agreed upon they would soon remove all other obstacles These  Preliminaries  were of no less consequence than the Restitution of two intire Provinces and of one  Place  of equal importance to all the rest These two  Powers  doubted that  Calliers  had made these advances of his own Head that he might with the greater facility discover their Pretensions but his Colleagues having assured them it was the King's sincere Intention they went on with the Treaty in such a manner as the World might perceive they meant to bring it to a happy Conclusion  In the mean time the Court of  France  increas'd in the number of Subjects by the  Conquests  it made during the course of the War tho it had to do with so many Enemies as one would have thought were sufficient to bring it to Desolation Nothing but Coaches was to be seen at  Versailles  some of them with the Ornaments peculiar to the Electors of the Empire and that was become so fashionable that even the  French  themselves had them set upon theirs However the better sort of Men despised it seeing no apparent reason why they were so ready to imitate the Cus  oms of the Empire for if His Majesty had firmly pretended to it he was so far from it now that there was not the least appearance of his arriving to it However there were some of these Gentlemen who had a just Title to carry them particularly the Count of  Egmont  who Married Madamoiselle  De Conac  the Archbishop of  Aix  's Niece His Majesty conferr'd the Honours of the  Louvre  upon her And these were justly due to her because her Husband was Lineally Descended of the Dukes of  Ghelderland  which created to her a great deal of envy amongst the other Ladies of Quality insomuch that the Mareschal  d'Estree  's  Lady could not dissemble her Resentment of it One day at Dinner with Mons  Pontchartrain  she said without regarding if any there would resent her discourse She admir'd that the Count of  Egmont  would condescend to Marry such a Girl as Madamoiselle  Conac  The Chevalier  d'Obtere  Governor of  Couelloure  overheard her and being Uncle to the young Gentlewoman could not avoid being concern'd at it He told the Gentleman who sat next him How unbecoming it was for  Morin  the  Jew  's Daughter to talk after that manner of a Person of his Niece's Quality that he own'd the Honour the Alliance had done both to her and all her Friends but great as it was it fail'd of that the  Morins  had by the Blood of the  Estrees  that the difference was not so great between the  Egmonts  and the  Conacs  as betwixt the  Etrees  and the Burgesses of the City of  Tours  All the Company expected that the Chevalier would not fail to resent it after that manner and knowing that the Lady was ignorant of the Chevalier's Interest in Madamoiselle they continu'd the Conversation upon the same subject with her that she might avoid a second oversight Then she became sensible of her fault and of the private reproof they gave her but whether she had done it because she knew him not or through imprudence she never made him any acknowledgement of it  Lent  follow'd soon after and a certain Monk nam'd  Seraphin  Guardian of the  Capucins  at  Meudon  was chosen to Preach before the King that Season he behav'd himself with such freedom that it was generally believ'd he would be forbid the Pulpit but His Majesty was so intent upon his Devotion as some alledge out of a principle of Christianity in favour of the  Peace  that he overlook'd a great many things which at any other time he would have maintain'd with  the point of his Sword I say His Majesty who honours all Men of Probity was so far from being offended at it that he own'd nothing pleas'd him more than his Sermons and desir'd him to continue them after the same manner nor did the King ever neglect any of them but perceiving that the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  never came to them he ask'd him the reason The Duke reply'd That he had no Seat in the Church His Majesty conferr'd the Bishop of  Orlean  's his first Almoner's Seat upon him the Bishop being then at his Cathedral two days journey from  Paris  whence returning very soon he desir'd to have his Seat again the Duke refus'd it pretending he never had it but out of Decency and now His Majesty conferring it upon him he meant to shut him out of it This difference made no less noise than Monsieur  Boleau  's Lutrin Both parties were back'd by their Friends in their pretensions and if they durst to have fought for it they were sufficiently animated against each other to have done it but resting satisfied to shew that they were both Men of Spirit they turn'd their Indignation to sollicite His Majesty that he would be pleas'd to decide the cause in favour of the respective Party  The King gave it for the Duke which vex'd the Prelate to that degree that out of spite he returned to his Diocess He carried the Abbot of  Coaslin  along with him as if by that he meant to engage him in his Resentment This Abbot had the survivorship of the Prelate's Charge as first Almoner and the expectation of the first Bishoprick should fall Besides his Uncle had no reason to complain of the favours of the Court After the Death of Monsieur  Chanvallon  Archbishop of  Paris  the King had awarded him his nomination for a Cardinal's Cap which he had formerly gratified the Archbishop with  So that neither of them could be excus'd from imprudence that shew'd so much Passion for so small a cause  About the same time his Brother the Duke of  Coaslin  had another kind of Vexation that seem'd to be better grounded than theirs His Coach was Arrested for Debt which the Advocate  Master of Requests  and  Register of the Points of Honour  before the Mareschals of  France  alledg'd was unduly done because of his Dignity Some years ago he made a great deal of noise about it in favour of the Duke of  Ventadour  who suffer'd the same Affront but as he was far inferior in Wit and Reputation to Monsieur  Pomponne  his Brotherinlaw after he had been crushed in the Defence he undertook in  Ventadour  's Affair he never dar'd to appear in defence of  Coaslin  He was e'en ready to lay down his Charge before the Mareschals of  France  which made him the more wary of engaging into new Troubles for fear of ending as he had begun  Tho' this was some Mortification for the Duke to be oblig  to Walk home afoot yet about the same time a more pressing Vexation afflicted the Dutchess or  Svlly  for the Princess of  Furstemberg  caus'd to seize both her Bed and Furniture for her Rent tho' she had run only three Years in Arrear there being thirteen Years Rent due at the Death of the Duke her Husband of which the Dutchess had clear'd ten since she was a Widow But there being a misunderstanding between them and the Princess alledging that the Dutchess had spoke with more freedom than decency of her when her Husband had been Wounded at Hunting she laid hold of this opportunity to make her repent of her imprudence These two Affairs were represented to the King to kn  w if his Majesty would exempt the Duke  or reduce the  o their  immovables But His Majesty's Answer gave them small encouragement he reply'd That every one was concern'd to pay their Debts and tho he did not approve of some procceedings yet it was sufficient that they were screen'd by Justice  The Dutchess of  Lude  's interest had better success for the Dutchess of  Vernevil  her Mother The King conferr'd a Pension of Twelve thousand Livres upon her which she had almost refus'd reputing it too mean for a Person of her Rank For as she had the honour to be the Widow of the King's Uncle she thought it her due to be treated as a Princess of the Blood tho' the advantage he boasted of came  the Lefthand His Majesty seldom gave them less than Twenty thousand Livres and she thought it was none of her business to accept of so little considering what others receiv'd who could not come in competiton with her In effect the Count of  Brancas  enjoy'd Fourteen thousand Livres for his Life and after his Death His Majesty continu'd it to the Princess of  Harcourt  his eldest Daughter A great many others had also larger Pensions than her's which vex'd her to that degree that she told her Daughter She meant to resign it again freely to the King The Dutchess of  Lude  not thinking it convenient for her to resent after this manner the Firstfruits of her favour disswaded her from it for it is His Majesty's Prerogative to give and not to receive Laws  About that time the only Son of the Marquis of  Gordes  presented a Petition to the King that vex'd the Marquis of  Rhodes  much more than his Gout which afflicted him for many Years The Marquis of  Rhodes  had married the other Sister He was no such Gamester as his Father but had a much lighter Head For had he been only a Gamester the Bishop had pardon'd him for  in that he had been of his own Kidney but the Prelate thinking him somewhat maddish causes him to be shut up in a Convent This poor Gentleman believ'd that the Bishop had impos'd upon His Majesty in the Affair and thought he could easily perswade the King of the contrary had he the honour to see him but as Fools do not think they are so or rather believe they are the wisest of Men if you credit their Oath The King did not think it convenient to trust him He was afraid to be deceiv'd as he had been lately by a Numscul who had escap'd out of the  Bastille  where his Friends had shut him up upon the same account He was a Cadet of the House of  Usez  but so little reform'd by his Imprisonment that immediately upon his escape he committed the height of Folly in marrying very miserably He chose a Woman that was neither Rich Young nor Handsome and for an additional comfort the Widow of a  Common Fellow  that became a Gentleman only at his Death for they did him the favour to cut his Throat in consideration of his Wife who was more honestly descended for had they treated him according to his merit they were affraid she might lye under the imputation of the Wife of a Man that was Hang'd But his Folly did not stop there for he carried her along with him to  Versails  and St  Cloud  where he had reviv'd the  Angels  that had died a long time before But as People have sometimes more pleasure in Fools than in Wise Men every one disturb'd his Brain the more in making him believe they delighted in his Folly  Much about that time there happen'd a quarrel betwixt two Persons of Quality at St  Cloud  who treated one another after the rate of true  Billingsgate  Their Sex excus'd them from the use of the Sword to decide it but being equally provided with the A  ms of the Sex they fairly  disputed for the Victory The one was Princess of  Montaban  and the other Madam of  Grancei  At last both having spent their Spirits in the Controversie without the least respect to one anothers reputation Madam of  Grancie  appeal'd to Monsieurwho was present to decide their Difference The Princess accepted freely of the motion and having call'd him that minute intreated him to judge the Affair impartially He gave thim an attentive hearing but after both of them had taken the pains to set forth their Cause he made answer That he discharged the Process They ask'd him in a grumbling way what he meant But the answer he made them shock'd them more than all that went before He reply'd That he had no other Sentence to give to such people as them and all they offer'd was as light as Wind They could never get him to give another Reason which made them resolve upon a mutual Accommodation without giving any body any further trouble upon the matter  This gave great joy to the Judge who finding them afterwards in a good understanding with one another accosted them in this manner  I told you  said he  That the Sentence I pronounced was the only one that could be given amongst such People as you Women of your Quality quarrel and agree again with equal facility and unless a Lover be in the case there is no fear of an Accomodation  Had the Duke of  Orleans  who loves Novelty been chosen Judge of their Difference he had possibly decided it rather in favour of the one than the other Tho' he had formerly some inclinations for Madan  Grancie  he thought now that her Face wrinkled with Age was not to be put in competition with the Charms of the Princess of  Montauban  This Lady made him Laugh when he had no mind to it she inherited  from her Ancestors a Genius for Comedy for she was Daughter to the Count of  Nogent  and Sister to the Chevalier of  Nogent  who is still alive and whose only Trade since he left the War was to make the Marquis of  Louvois  laugh This Minister had him along with him in his own Colash in all his Journies nor was he the only person who lov'd to divert himself with Childish Expressions for Monsieur  Colbert  at his leisure Hours had also People to entertain him with ridiculous Stories It's pity but Madam  D'Anoy  and Madam  de Moral  had thought at that time of diverting him with their Fairies they had been often very acceptable Thus you see great Men have their weak side as well as others and there is nothing that convinces us more of the frailty of humane Nature  The pleasure the Duke of  Orleans  found in the Princess of  Montauban  's Conversation made him resolve to carry her along with him to  Marly  All are not free to go thither and it must be by Stratagem that leave is obtain'd to go for after the King is earnestly sollicited he reckons it a particular Favour to grant it as in effect it is to go where the Prince goes and to appear before him in a place where there is no confusion to be seen tho' it prevails in other places where the Court comes The Duke's expectation was frustrated for His Majesty refus'd his Request However the Duke not being much discourag'd at the first Repulse insisted in his demand hoping to obtain it at last by his importunity At last seeing His Majesty inexorable he intreated him at least to impart his Reason No doubt tho' the King who always goes upon good grounds had a very plausible Reason but suspecting it might prove disobliging to the Princess he desir'd in a smiling way to be excus'd from a thing he had resolv'd not to tell The Duke who is always  very pressing in what he undertakes observing that the King had only  old him so in a smiling way importun'd His Majesty more than ever to know his Reason His Majesty to be freed from his importunity at last made him answer That because he was so very earnest he would tell him freely That he was always well pleas'd to see handsome Women and the Princess of  Montauban  being none of the number he would not accustom his Eyes to look upon her In effect she was very far from being Handsome Her Face was mark'd with scars from her Infancy she was Hunch'd Back'd but found the secret to conceal it in some measure by the help of Steel Bodies besides being somewhat advanc'd in Years she was the more insupportable However being still as Handsome in the Duke's Opinion as a great many other Women whom His Majesty Honour'd with the same Favour he still pleaded on her behalf He ask'd His Majesty if she was not as Handsome as such and such Ladies whom he always carried along with him to the Castle of  Marly  The King fell a Laughin  g when he saw his Brother take it so patiently and left him to continue his Discourse which tended only to perswade him that the Ladies which he mentioned had no better Title to such marks of distinction than she for whom he was pleading for he made him no other answer than what he told him at first  Madam  de Montauban  resolving to go to  Versailles  at any rate and seeing all the Duke's Endeavours prove Fruitless thought of a more plausible pretext She applied herself to the Princess of  Harcourt  who had the secret of obtaining a great many things when others met with a refusal Five hundred Crowns brought her Project to bear and by these means she had the Honour to go to  Marly  an Honour she had  aspir'd to of a long time and which was like to have cost her her  Wits  if she had not obtain'd it The King was well enough pleas'd with the grant he had made he found her very pleasant and good Humour'd and this Lady who never knew what t  was to fast  Fridays  or  Saturdays  found it no difficulty to comply with what others did there In effect finding herself in a place where the King never allow'd any one to eat Flesh She out of Love to His Majesty or out of Fear to displease him did what neither the Love nor Fear of God were ever capable to oblige her to do But every person there knowing her ordinary practice in that Affair she thought it convenient to vindicate herself to those who were highly offended at the difference she made betwixt a mortal Man and God But all she said had rather more Gallantry in it than real Apology She could say nothing but that the Food there had a taste very different from the Food of the rest of Mankind that the Beams of the Sun of  France  created another kind of warmth than the ordinary Sun insomuch that there was a certain happiness under his influence that was not to be found any where else  But this sort of Discourse produc'd a quite different effect from what she expected for those who blam'd her before condemn'd her much more now They thought it had been much more proper for her as no doubt it was to have avoided all manner of Apology than to make use of that she made For as they maintain'd very well it was an adding of impiety to the scandal to attribute more power to a Man than to God but she suffered them to go on being sure to have the wanton Youths on her side for 'tis at Court as at other places they divert themselves often with ridiculous Trifles and  est and most P  ous are not always the  most respected This appear'd too evidently not long after in a difference she had with her Husband He came to Court alone while her entry was accompanied with a numerous Train of all sorts of people shewing by that means the respect they had for her Hence she took occasion to insult over him as if his Solitude had given him an aversion to innocent Mirth But he reply'd so smartly home that she would gladly have dispensed with the severe Compliment she oblig'd him to return They found what he said was somewhat extraordinary especially of one descended of a Family that never had the Reputation of being over Witty for he was the Son of the Duke of  Montbason  whom they had shut up in a Convent for his giddy Brain at least that was all the Reason they gave for divesting him of his Estate tho' in good earnest they would be oblig'd to build more  Bedlams  than one if they meant to shut up all that are many degrees greater Num sculls than he  Debauchery was still in vogue amongst the Women and consequently amongst the Men ho' the King omitted nothing that could be done to oblige all People to a just observance of their Duty The  Italian  Comedians who had a dexterity of Acting every thing happily took thence an occasion of introducing so many indecencies upon their Stages that 'twas complained of to His Majesty This displeas'd him the more that they published an Advertisement of representing very soon a person of Quality Therefore His Majesty expell'd them out of the Kingdom and for a long time he was indifferent as to the Play and if at any time he order'd them to act before him it was rather to amuse the young People or through policy than for any pleasure he himself took in it In effect it is convenient to keep the  in Action and some  people allow even of a lesser evil to obviate a greater Tho' I hardly believe that the Gentlemen of  Port Royal  would be of that Opinion were they consulted in it and amongst all the Casuists we shall never find any reasonable pretence that can warrant us to commit any evil However His Majesty had no sooner form'd this Resolution than he sent Monsieur  D'Argenson  to shut up their  Theater  Accordingly he went immediately before they could have the least intelligence of the Storm that threatned them and call'd a great many Commissaries to attend him not that he fear'd any Rebellion but in regard the King commanded him to go about it with the greatest solemnity For the Scandal they had given being publick the King would have their Punishment to be the same Besides he commanded to seal up all their Seats He knew they had kept their Manuscripts in them and therefore would make sure of all they had given Advertisements of They were extreamly surprised at this manner of Usage and the more in that they had never dream'd of it They went all in a Body to  Versailles  to prostitute themselves at His Majesty's Feet they represented to him how they were call'd before they came to  France  which was matter of fact for Cardinal  Mazarin  who himself was the greatest Comedian in the Universe and perhaps was afraid to forget a part he had Acted all his days desir'd from time to time to see some new Scenes to put him in mind of his Trade Upon this score they alledg'd That having left their Country upon that invitation it was an injustice done to them at that time to turn 'em out of the Nation But the King foreseeing what they aim'd at prevented them saying he doubted not but it was to please Cardinal  Mazarin  they undertook that Journey and if they pleas'd to own  the truth they had no reason to repent of their Trouble They came into  France  a Foot and were in a condition to go out of it in a Coach This Reply gave them to understand that His Majesty was Displeas'd therefore they thought to make their Application to some good Patron to appease him but whether it was that every one was more ready to abandon them than protect them because they had spared no body upon their  Theater  or that the Courtiers were sensible the King had no inclination to shew them any favour not one person was found to plead for them They were therefore oblig'd to look out for some other Trade for their future subsistence and their  Theater  continues shut up till this day  In the mean time the King's Army in  Flanders  laid Seige to  Ath  a place His Majesty had given up to the  Spaniards  by the Treaty of  Nimiguen  The Count  de Rheux  commanded within the Town with a good Garrison amongst whom were a great many  French  Deserters who looking upon themselves lost if they came to be known desir'd to have the charge of the principal attacks In all appearance they would choose rather to be cut to pieces than to surrender But the Count of  Rheux  considering they might also deliver up the Post in expectation of a Pardon was so far from trusting or uniting them in one Body as they desir'd that he dispersed them amongst the different Regiments to avoid the present Consequences he fear'd There were three Marshals of  France  in that Army namely the Marshal of  Vlileroy  the Marshal of  Boufflers  and the Marshal of  Catinat  but this last being beyond dispute the greatest of the three it was to him the King gave the Direction of the Siege  Villeroy  and  Boufflers  made head against the Enemies Army which was jointly commanded by King  William  and the Duke of  Bavaria  But  if these two Princes made any motion it was not to run any risque for they were sensible all their attempts would prove in vain The Treaty of  Reswick  was going on a pace and knowing very well that the King would be oblig'd to give up that Place by the Peace they did not think it convenient to Sacrifice one Man for its relief If they had no mind to venture a Battle they might easily lay Siege to  Dinant  while Marshal  de Catinat  was busied at  Ath  But then  Brussels  that was Bumbarded the Year before was left expos'd for  Villeroy  and  Boufflers  to Besiege so that they could not conveniently quit their Post Besides they knew that  Ath  was one of the places the Plenipotentaries of  France  offer'd to give up to the Allies It had been therefore very needless for them to throw away the lives of Men upon that design since they were sure of having it without stroak of Sword  These reasons oblig'd them to keep their Stations or if they mov'd at any time it was only to find a Camp where their Troops could be supplied more conveniently with all necessaries By that means Marshal  de Catinat  found little difficulty in his Enterprize The Count  de Reux  for his part was prepossess'd as well as King  William  and the Duke of  Bavaria  with a design of husbanding his Men it being his Interest as well as the King's Insomuch that there was hardly any shooting from the Town nor was there ever a Siege where the Besieged made less noise The  French  were extreamly astonish'd at it and the Governor having surrendred said in a merry mode to the Hostages who were sent to make the Capitulation that it must be owned the  French  are very bad Husbands considering how poor they were said to be for that they had lavished many thousand weight of Powder before that Place and yet he was ready to hold  if they pleas'd five hundred Pistoles to a Penny that in less than four Months time the  Spaniards  would enter the place without being at the expence of one grain of Powder These Hostages were not ignorant of his meaning and could hardly avoid condemning their own Folly They own'd they were very much to blame to throw away so many Lives upon a place without the least expectation of any Advantage Not that they had lost any Person of Consequence nor indeed so many Common Soldiers as was at first alledg'd but what they spoke was with regard to the insignificancy of that Conquest for as few as they were it was still a greater loss than necessary since their Blood ought to have been valued  The Duke of  Vendome  for his part Besieged  Barcelona  both by Sea and Land tho' he had acquainted His Majesty that he was in no Circumstances to do it yet being commanded by a supreme Order he was oblig'd to undertake it against his Inclination It was never known that any place was invested after such a manner for he had not Troops enough to make the Circumvallation So that the Besieged had always opportunity to keep a Communication with the  Vice Roy  of  Catalonia  who took the Field in order to relieve them The Duke of  Vendome  to supply his want of Men took out of the King's Ships that were before the Town all who were able to carry Arms This added somewhat to his Force but not sufficiently to compleat his Circumvallation So that all the World believ'd he had engag'd in an Enterprize which would cerrainly cost him his Honour In effect besides that the Besieged could depart and enter the Town at liberty they were so numerous that one would have thought it was rather an Army than a Ga  rison They had eleven Thousand Men  in the place and the Queen of  Spain  being in hopes of preserving it for her Nephew recommended it in particulor to the Prince of  Armstadt  who next to the Governor had the principal Command He promis'd Her Majesty confidently to behave himself so as she should have no reason to be dissatisfied and to make good his Promise there pass'd very few days withou  making some Sallies which extreamly retarded the advancing of the Works They disputed every Inch of Ground with 'em and the World was ready to believe That as the Arms of  France  had gain'd some Reputation at the taking of  Ath  their Glory was like to be obscur'd by a far different Event before this place and for an additional misfortune the News from  Poland  gave them reason to suspect that the Abbot of  Polignac  had acted too precipitantly in declaring the Prince of  Conti  King for all the advices particular Persons receiv'd from that Country were so unfavourable that now they despair'd of success  However their News from all hands made no mention of the Duke of  Saxony  and the Emperor conceal'd his Design as to that Affair so closely that it was impossible to penetrate into it It was generally believ'd That Prince  James  was the only Rival the Prince of  Conti  had to fear and this was the common Opinion in  Po  and  for not one dream'd of the Duke of  Saxony  but such as were in the Plot Nevertheless Prince  James  was universally hated by great and small in regard of the King his Father who ever since he had mounted the Throne behaved himself towards his Subjects rather as a particular interessed Person than as a true Sovereign for he had made open Sale of all the Favours with which the Kings his Predecessors had always us'd to gratifie their Subjects So that tho' these People  were for many Ages accustom'd to choose noKing in a strange Family when their own Royal Family afforded one yet they had forgotten that Custom so far in regard of him that they would rather have seen the meanest of themselves upon the Throne than have chosen any of his Issue They were extreamly afraid that they following his Example when advanced to the Royal Dignity would squeeze their Subjects to the very Marrow as he had always done  This general Aversion rais'd the hopes of the Abbot of  Polignac  tho' he saw that a great many of the Palatines would not declare for the Prince This he attributed to their Avarice and thought it was only out of a design of obliging him to give more Money They were glad to find him of that Opinion for while he continued ignorant of their Conduct their Affair was like to have the better success In fine  This  and the Affair of  Barcelona  were the two things that were most in view at  France  when the Duke of  Vendome  wrote to His Majesty if he did not send him some Succours he had reason to fear that his Honour would certainly suffer in the Enterprize in which he was engaged He gave the King a particular account of what had pass'd before the Place that His Majesty might be the more sensible of his straits So that the King having no more Reason to doubt of his Necessity caus'd all the Troops he could draw out of  Languedoc  and  Provence  to march th  her This fresh Reinforcement wrought won  tho' even then they nere not in a Con  to draw the Line of Circumvallation The  lost no time to attack the Outworks which  batter'd for a long time with a great many  The Soldiers behav'd themselves with an  Bravery and having made theselves Masters  of the  Covert Way  they afterwards attack'd the  Bastion  which was taken and retaken twice A Colonel of the  Irish  nam'd  Dillon  who Commanded one of these attacks had pass'd his time there very indifferently if he had not been well belov'd by the Regiment One of his Soldiers who had deserted into the Town came within four paces of him and having distinguished him from the others  Dillon  said he  Mind that it's in my power to Kill thee but I won't for thou never hast done me any harm However because thou hast by thee an Officer who is a common Hangman of the Soldiers I'll at least hinder him from doing any more mischief  This said he Shot him through the Belly dead upon the Spot This  Bastion  having been thus disputed by both Parties it fell at last into the hands of the Duke of  Vendome  who rais'd a Battery upon it from which he thundred in such a manner into the Town that he judg'd in all appearance the Enemies would be oblig'd to surrender it in a short time He acquainted the King with these News and wrote to him That he hoped in five or six days to send  Chameraut  to His Majesty with an account of the Place's being surrendred Every one was glad to hear this News with which His Majesty was overjoy'd This Express was very acceptable and while they were impatient for the arrival of the other who was to compleat His Majesty's satisfaction they admir'd mightily that good Fortune that made him Master of a Place where there was not only a numerous Garrison but where it was also impossible for his own Army to shut up all the Passages However from day to day they waited  Chameraut  's arrival and expected him with the first Post At last there arriv'd one who they believ'd came from that Country because his  haise was extreamly Dirty But no Dirt comes  thence for it is always dry there in regard it  seldom or never Rains in that Country but the Roads leading from thence being very deep and it having Rain'd so much lately there was a sudden Report in  Paris  that an Express was arriv'd with the News of  Barcelona  's being taken However it was a pleasant sort of Courier that came in that Chaise namely a lusty  Sturgeon  which they had catch'd in  Normandy  and sent to the  Dauphin  yet it was needless to tell the World so none was like to believe it being so prepossess'd with  Chemeraut  's arrival This obliged a Court Lord to Answer these Faithless People who spoke to him after that manner That it was true the Courier was arriv'd but had rencountred with a Misfortune upon the Road so that none could learn the particulars of the Towns being taken from him That having met with Assassins the Postillion brought him dead in the Chaise and that no doubt they had carried off his Packet for having search'd him they had found none about him This Discourse gave occasion to another piece of News fully as true as the former For the Report flying about very suddenly all  Paris  believ'd the next day that  Chemeraut  had been Kill'd However the Man was in excellent good health and so far from having any desire to die that he took all possible care of his Person He was as Fat and Gross as four other Men nor did he become so by feeding upon the Air for he generally eat as much as other twelve Men  After all these News prov'd only false Alarms Before the Town was taken the  Viceroy  was resolv'd to hazzard a Battle with the Duke and for that purpose summon'd together all those whom they call  Miquelets  in that Country and having joyn'd them with his regular Troops he  approach'd to the Duke of  Vendome  It had been in vain for him to cut off their Provisions by Land they being supply'd from the Sea He had a more noble Design than to amuse himself so meanly he meant to decide the Affair all at once by a Battle and to that purpose having call'd a Council of War he resolved with his General Officers to march the next day in the Evening directly towards the Duke He acquainted the Governor of  Barcelona  with his Resolution to the end that at the same time he might make a vigorous Sally upon the Enemies and so attack them upon all sides In less than half an hour after the Duke knew all the measures they had concerted against him and being thus put upon his Guard he march'd to meet him the Night before he was to execute his Design But the Viceroy had already divided his Army in two parts in order to attack him with the greater advantage This was made known to the Duke who fell upon him with extraordinary fury notwithstanding the Laurels the ViceRoy had promised to himself he was still in Bed when they came to acquaint him that his Guards lost ground they made no resistance at all but betook them to their heels and the Duke had certainly taken the Viceroy as was expected in Bed if they had not awaked him of a sudden The Noise he heard about his Tent having surpriz'd his Attendants as well as himself made them believe that all was lost He excus'd his  Valet de Chambre  from his Duty at that time and fearing he had no time to Dress he made the best of his way Naked as he was thinking the greatest thing he could do was to save himself The part of his Army that was with him followed his Example except a very few that put themselves upon the Defence The Duke made a great many Prisoners  the ViceRoy's small Trunk fell also into his hands with twenty Tousand Pistols in  Specie  and the Soldiers made a considerable Booty All he wanted now to compleat his Victory was to know that the other Detachment he had sent against him had met with the same Fate and in a very little time he had that satisfaction He knew that Mons  D'Usson  whom he had entrusted with that Expedition had behav'd himself gallantly and return'd to joyn him with all the Glory he could desire  The Governor of  Barcelona  was as much surprised as the Prince  D'Armstad  when he heard these Tydings The Duke did not keep him long in the Dark he sent to acquaint him with it that he might not continue any longer to make a fruitless Defence But having still eight Thousand Men in Garrison he thought it Dishonourable to surrender to a Prince who had not Soldiers enough to invest the Place intirely and therefore kept out some few days longer rather to fulfil the Duty of a brave Commander of which he had been always emulous than out of any hops of hindring the Town from being taken  In effect in a very few days he caus'd a Parly to be beat pretending to give up the Town only and retire with his Men into the Castle which being situated upon a Hill he could hold out for a considerable time But he delay'd so long in surrendring that the Duke refus'd to accept any other Composition than to have the Castle given up as well as the Town The Governor thought this condition very severe but as those who are Conquer'd are commonly oblig'd to receive Laws from the Conqueror so he was fain to accept of it It was then that  Chemeraut  appear'd at Court of a different size from a  Sturgeon  He brought these good Tydings  to the King which pleas'd His Majesty extreamly who began to fear some reverse of Fortune might have happen'd to the Duke of  Vendome  since he had sent his last Express  Chemeraut  had twenty Thousand Livers for his pains and a Commission to act as Marshal  de Camp  His Majesty being now freed from all his Fears had more reason to be assur'd of the Peace for besides that the Conference at  Ryswick  went on apace there were some other Conferences upon the same Subject betwixt the Marshal of  Boufflers  and the Earl of  Portland  After the loss of  Ath  King  William  who knows how to make his advantage of every thing judging this Earl in every degree as dexterous as the Marshal thought it convenient to employ him upon that Head by this means he meant to remove more speedily a great many difficulties that could not be so easily terminated in a longer time At  Ryswick  in regard of the Formalities the Plenipotentaries were oblig'd to observe measures with one another  Portland  sent a Trumpeter as of his own accord to the Marshal to ask a private interview with him without making any mention of his Affair The Marshal thought it convenient with the Advice of the other two  French  Marshals to consent to it and having agreed that they should meet by themselves and their Guards should be of an equal number The Earl propos'd to him to remove some Differences there that would require too long time at  Ryswick  The Marshal being unwilling to undertake any thing without express Order from His Majesty sent an Express to know his Will The great desire the King had to make Peace made him approve of what the Earl propos'd without considering perhaps what advantage he might have over the Marshal in a superiour Genius and the inconvenience of putting him upon  a level with a Marshal of  France  an Honour His Majesty ought not to look upon as indifferent It's true as the King of  France  had advanced  Boufflers  from a Cadet of  Picardy  to the Dignity of a Duke Marshal of  France  Governor of the most considerable Province of his Kingdom And in fine of a Knight of his  Order  So King  William  had rais'd the other from an ordinary Gentleman of  Guelderland  to an Earl and Peer of  England  and Knight of the Order of the  Garter  But still there was this difference that the one Commanded an Army and the other never did Besides there was that also to be said That  His most Christian Majesty  had never own'd King  William  and so the  French  esteem'd only the Earl as the Favourite of a Prince whom they had never recogniz'd as King  King  William  was glad that His most Christian Majesty overlook'd all those considerations not that he wanted to obtain a recognisance from him as well as from other Crown'd Heads but because he knew well that the  English  were as passionately desirous of a Peace as the  French  Their Commerce was then at a stand and which is very surprising the most Christian King had been a gainer by what was reckon'd his probable Ruin After he had lost I do not know how many Ships at  la Hogue  and was render'd uncapable of appearing at Sea He had found his Account in the way of Piracy and had taken so many Prizes both from the  English  and  Dutch  that both of 'em were quite cast down 'Tis inconceivable what an infinite number these Prizes are said to amount to and tho' I have heard an account of it from one of the greatest Traders in  England  who ought to know that Affair as well as any body yet I shall be cautious of repeating it for fear I should be  charg'd with Credulity In effect the thing is so surprizing that it astonishes one But after all if we consider that these two Nations subsist only by their Commerce and that the Sea was continually cover'd with their Vessels so that the  French  had an opportunity of attacking 'em every minute with an advantage especially when they were without Convoys upon this consideration I say we may easily conceive how they came to sustain so great a loss But let it be as it will K  William  being sensible of the necessity of a Peace in order to be free from such Inconveniencies order'd my Lord  Portland  to remove all the difficulties that might oppose it  In the mean time K  James  had but a sorry Game to play Pursuant to the King's Promise of never making a Peace till he were restored He had all along hop'd that His Majesty would effect his Restoration sooner or later And this his expectation was screw'd higher by the King's open Declaration to all  Europe  that he would make his Promise good Besides that this unhappy Prince was turn'd out of his Dominions only because he would not declare against the King He had been frequently Sollicited to oppose the King's Interest before the Prince of  Orange  came into his Place and had he done that no Potentate whatsoever would ever have consented to his being disquieted Nay to speak the Truth 'twas a thing of too dangerous Consequence for the Potentates themselves but that Prince having discover'd his firm Resolution to stand by the secret Alliance he had made with the King all other Princes combin'd against him because he would not joyn with them in reducing a Power that seem'd to threaten their Repose This the most Ch  istian King was very sensible of and did not fail to acknowledge it He did for him all that he could do  and offer'd both him and his Qeen a Retreat and Entertainment Tho' he was engag'd in a War with the greatest part of  Europe  yet he gave him fifty thousand  Louis d'Ors  a Year 'Tis true this was but a small allowance for the King of  England  upon the comparison with what he had when he possess'd his Dominions but 'twas a great deal for a Prince to give that was at the same time oblig'd to maintain four or five hundred thousand Men to make head against the numerous Enemies that his Grandeur had raised against him and upon that score doubtless K  James  was oblig'd to him But after all 'twas not long of the King that he did not make good his Promise The unfortunate Prince had been always guilty of the same Fault that his Brother committed when he occasion'd the loss of the Battle of  Dunbar  He caress'd the  Scots  in such a manner that he himself oppos'd his own Restauration His chief Minister was a  Scotchman  and there having always been a great jealousie between the  English  and  Scots  the preference he gave to the latter at his Court alienated the Hearts of the former This was the occasion that a great many Enterprizes form'd on his behalf never took and forasmuch as that Prince had much more Devotion than Brains as the  French  could not but lament his Fate so they could not avoid saying That tho' he had sunk himself by his bad Conduct yet 'twas not reasonable they should suffer themselves to be suck'd in along with him In fine the King being much more oblig'd to his own Kingdom than to any other could not avoid the giving him to know That many things he did were directly opposite to his Interest Nay all his true Friends had told him the same thing upon several occasions insomuch that to satisfie the one and the other he pretended to disgrace My Lord  Melfort  Brother to the Chancellor of  Scotland  This Minister was hated not only at his Master's Court but even by the  French  who had attended  K James  in  Ireland  These alledg'd That if it had not been for him Things had gone otherwise in that Country than they did Nay some of 'em did not stand to charge him openly with keeping a Correspondence with the Enemies affirming that if it had not been so he had never made such opposition as he did against all that Mr  Roses  the most Christian King's Lieutenant General proffer'd to attempt in that Country And in earnest if the digression were excusable I could easily make it out that  that  Minister wanted either Conduct or Fidelity God forbid that I should affirm with others that he entertain'd a Corespondence with K  William  But to overlook all these things and return to my Subject all these Circumstances oblig'd His most Christian Majesty to joyn with K  William  in removing the Obstacles that might retard the Peace The first Conference between Marshal  Boufflers  and my Lord  Portland  was seconded quickly by several others They adjusted several things that the Plenipotentaries at  Ryswick  would not have agreed upon in a Years time However at one of their Interviews where several Officers were present on both sides My Lord  Portland  hearing a discharge of Cannon and Musquets in the  French  Army ask'd the Marshal what the meaning of it was The Marshal made answer That 'twas occasion'd by the News the King had sent of the Prince of  Conti  's Election to the Crown of  Poland  This was matter of Fact for Abbot  P  ignac  had dispatch'd a Courier to the Court to acquaint the King that the Prince was proclaim'd King of  Poland  by the Cardinal Primate and some Palatines that sided with him But this Intelligence included another part namely  That the Elector of  Saxony  was likewise proclaim'd King by the Bishop of  Cujavia  and all the Partisans of the  House of Austria  This ought at least probably to have prevented our making so much haste and upon that score my Lord  Portland  fell a Laughing and told the Marshal That indeed this spoke the  French  to be quicker than all other Nations That they had formerly shewn the same disposition upon many Occasions and that in this Affair they still continu'd to have the start of their Allies but in the mean time the Allies having time enough to testifie their Joy upon the advantages that accru'd to 'em had resolv'd to stay till Night or next Morning before they gave a solemn proof of the Joy they were fill'd with upon the News That the Duke of  Saxony  and not the Prince of  Conty  had mounted that Throne  The Marshal thought he Banter'd him in proposing a Protestant for a Dignity that could not be enjoy'd but by a RomanCatholick Had my Lord made mention of Prince  James  it had made another sort of impression upon him In fine my Lord  Portland  having a mind that he should not flatter himself any longer upon the imaginary Success of the  French  Party gave him a naked account of the Matter Upon this discovery the Army that was Celebrating the Glory of the Prince of  Conty  with a full admiration of his Valou  were then mightily surpriz'd However they were unwilling to believe it for that Nation can never be perswaded of any thing that tends to their disadvantage whether it be That this is a common Humour among other Nations or That they in particular are presumptuous upon their own Merit But what inflam'd their suspicion the Court who knew the bottom of Things more than any body else was very silent upon the Matter after the Solemnity was over  Their design in the Solemnity was only to perswade the People That their Interest went well in  Poland  and so to comfort 'em in some measure for the loss of the Money they had sent thither The People were the more willing to shew their Congratulation That all of 'em had not only a Respect but a Love for the Prince of  Conty  nay they even ador'd him so true it is That a good Reputation is able to produce marvellous Effects in the Minds of the People  I cannot tell what the Prince's own Thoughts were or whether he believ'd the Report of the reality of his Election He made no discovery of his Mind Those who were accustom'd to weigh Things before they c  dit 'em took the liberty to speak  Mind Some were of opinion That supposi  case had been as favourable as it was represented yet they could not make it bear withou  Blows They were likewise sensible That the War they were oblig'd to undertake upon that account would be very disadvantageous to 'em They knew very well that the Duke of  Saxony  was a powerful Prince and that his Confederate Princes had their Troops conveniently Posted that they could easily conduct 'em to  Poland  without any danger whereas the Troops to be sent from  France  would be oblig'd to imbark in some SeaPort of the  French  landers  and land in the Neighbourhood of certain Potentates whose Affection to the Prince of  Conty  the King had some reason to doubt  The Prince of  Conty  perceiving he would be oblig'd to unsheath his Sword if he meant to make good his Election durst not display the Affliction he was under upon the view of leaving a Mistress that he lov'd as passionately as a Crown His only aim was to please the King who press'd him to accept of that Crown as well for his own Interest as out of the Love he bore  him However such a degree of indifference was very odd in a Prince of his Courage and a Nephew of the Prince of  Conde  One would have thought that he would have exerted his utmost efforts to mount the Throne since his Uncle upon a design of that nature had not only rais'd a Civil War in his Country but put himself at the Head of the Capital Enemies of his King and Country Some days pass'd without any noise only the King saluted the Prince and Princess as King and Queen of  Poland  In like manner all the Grandees pay'd 'em the Respect suitable to that Dignity and in order to give a colour for his not departing to receive the Crown 'twas given out That Ambassadors were expected from  Poland  to fetch him The more credulous sort of People satisfy'd themselves with this News but the more sensible part of Mankind were more distrustful than ever of the validity of the Election They own'd indeed That to wait the Arrival of Ambassadors was a Thing of more Glory than to depart before their Arrival but at the same time they alledg'd and that very justly That 'twas not expedient when a Crown is not disputed and that the Crown being promis'd to him he was so far from being ty'd to that  that he ought to set out with the utmost  and appear at the Head of his Party le  t for want of his Presence many should be corrupted and drawn over to his Enemy  Fr  nce  had not forgot That the occasion of the War they were then engag'd in which in a manner threaten'd their very Throne was their unseasonable Difference with the Pope and upon that view were sensible That tho' His Holiness had not so much Interest in this Affair as in the former yet they ought not to neglect him In order to secure his Favour They represented  with the utmost application their suspicion of the Elector of  Saxony  's Conversion Indeed that was a very nice Point and all Men tho' never so partial were sensible That his declaring for the  Roman  Religion had more of Ambition in it than Devotion However the Pope being unwilling that a Protestant Prince should Sit upon that Throne was so much against the Elector that one would have thought he could never be for him Besides the CardinalPrimate sent a Courier to assure him That the Interest of the Catholick Religion was entirely ruin'd if he suffer'd the Elector to be prefer'd to the Prince of  Conty  This Message he was prompted to as well by his Interest as by his Zeal for the  Roman  Religion for the Bishop of  Cujavia  had incroach'd upon the Privileges of the Archbishop of  Gnesne  which justly claims the sole Right of Proclaiming the Elected King  In the mean time there happen'd a Quarrel between Husband and Wife in one of the principal Families retaining to the Court 'Twas neither occasion'd by Jealousie nor the disproportion of Tempers as such Differences commonly are but by a very odd Adventure when the one approv'd of a Thing that the other did not We must know that a Noble  Venetian  not a Member of the Senate but one of the Nobles of the  Terrafirma  being Marry'd to a Lady that he lov'd very tenderly had so much Complaisance as to satisfie her Curiosity by carrying her to see  France  But tho' the Beauty of  France  draws so many Strangers to visit it yet her design was only to have it said that she resembled the Queen of  Sheba  in coming so far to see the Glory of  Solomon  She had heard a thousand great Things of the King and His Reign and being fond of seeing with her Eyes whether the Reports were true or enlarg'd beyond the due extent she came  on purpose along with her Husband to  Versailles  in order to make the discovery Such an Adventure as this was only wanting to compleat the History of the King and those who are employ'd in Writing it will take care not to forget it However the Husband and his Wife appearing of a sudden at Court Mr  Bontems  Governor of the Castle had a mind to know who they were pursuant to the King's Orders injoyning him to take notice of all the unknown Faces that appear'd there Accordingly he caus'd to ask 'em Who they were and what brought 'em there He was the more particular in his Questions in that he heard their Equipage was a true  Bohemian  Equipage and had serv'd to amuse not only Men of Sense but even the very Children When the Question was ask'd 'em they were surpriz'd for that such Conduct was inconsistent with the Liberty that Reigns in their Country But being inform'd that all unknown Faces were treated the same way the Noble  Venetian  would needs go in Person to acquaint Mr  Bontems  with the occasion of their Voyage Mr  Bontems  was surpriz'd to hear of his Complaisance and having spoke of it to the King was order'd to bring 'em both to see him Dine To recompence the charge they were at they were plac'd in the most convenient Place for having a full view of the King I cannot tell what their Thoughts were or whether they said what the Queen of  Sheba  said of  Solomon  but all the Courtiers being acquainted with their Errand none of 'em us'd 'em so as one not long ago was by  John Bart  one of the famousest Pyrates that the King had during the last War if it be lawful to give that Title to a Man that obey'd the King's Orders Pray God forbid that in using that expression I should mean to reflect upon the Methods us'd by that Prince for disturbing the Repose of his Enemies  I am too sensible of the Respect we ought to have for Supream Powers to indulge my self in that liberty And I am likewise sensible That he having so many Enemies upon him shew'd in that as in all other things the depth of his judgment  To return to my subject  John Bart  having the curiosity as well as these Foreigners to see the King Dine there came a Person dignify'd with a Blue Ribbon that finding he had a good Place took it from him without being overaw'd by his Mein which speaks him more a simple Tarpallion than a Commander of a Squadron  John Bart  had heard that some Compliment was due to a Blue Ribbon however he took him by the Coat upon which the Badges of his Knighthood were fix'd and told him with a loud Voice  Mr Blue Ribbon pray give me my Place you see the King when you will but for me who does not see him but at the four Festivals of the Year 'tis but reasonable that I should not tamely suffer my self to be robb'd of an advantage that I enjoy so seldom  The King hearing that fell a Laughing and told the Gentleman with the blue Ribbon That  Bart  was in the right and that 'twas His Pleasure that he should give  Bart  his Place and rather stand behind him than affront him in that manner Upon that  John Bart  being better known on Board than at Court the BlueRibbon Spark turn'd about to view him and apprehending his Mein to be much different from his Reputation whisper'd to a Duke that was just by him That if the Noble  Venetian  and his Lady had receiv'd as little satisfaction from the sight of the King as he had from that of  John Bart  they would be sure to grudge their Money But that could not be for tho' the King is very much alter'd from what he was yet he still preserves his good Mein insomuch that 'tis still visible that he has been a very graceful Man  In fine they were far from meeting with what  John Bart  did for every body knew they came too far not to have the opportunity of seeing the King But they had no sooner receiv'd satisfaction in that point than they return'd to  Italy  'Tis said they staid only three days at  Paris  and that rather to rest themselves than to see the Curiosities of the Place This Scene being Acted in the Face of the whole Court and being the common subject of Discourse the Person of Quality I pointed to above happening to Talk of it to his Lady a Quarrel ensued after this manner The Lady told her Husband That if she were to wish for any thing in this World it should be this That she might have as Complaisant a Husband as that  Venetian  Lady he having undertaken a Journey of almost Leagues on purpose to please her and by that means shewn the greatest instances of a pliant Temper that any Man can ever shew Her Husband reply'd That his Conduct did not speak so much a flexible Temper as Folly and that for his part if he had a Wife that would desire such a thing of him he would look on her as the greatest and most extravagant Fool not only in  Paris  but even in  Bedlam  Each of 'em maintain'd their Sentiments with great warmth and the Lady told him That it seem'd he was not in the humour to satisfie her in case she desir'd to see the Emperor or the King of  Spain  The Gentleman made answer That if ever that Maggot took her he would not content himself with shutting her up in  Bedlam  but would stifle her with his own Hands as a Madwoman Perhaps he only said so to signifie the aversion he had for these two Princes who were the King's Enemies But the Lady putting a Literal meaning upon the reply they came to high Words and quarrel'd outright  This was the Product of the Complaisance that a Noble  Venetian  shew'd to his Lady But in the mean while there happen'd an Accident at Court that was yet more surprizing and that one Day will perplex the Historians tho' they are not very fond of sounding the truth of it There's a little Town in  Provence  call'd  Salon  that formerly gave Birth to  Nostradamus  a Man very well known at this Day by his Centuries some of which have come to pass in so convincing a manner that what was formerly obscure is now as clear as Sunshine Among these Articles I reckon what relates to the Death of  Charles  I King of  England  and that of Mr  de Cinqumares  provided still that these were not foisted afterhand into his Works But let that be as it will this Town which produc'd a sort of a Prophet in the preceding Age has furnish'd us with one in this or at least such a Character is given of a certain Gentleman that appear'd then at Court of whom this is the History About that time the pretended Ghost of that famous Astrologer abovemention'd appear'd to a Man of this City I know not whether it was by Night or by Day but this I know That the Apparition put the Man in a great fear and above all things advis'd him not to mention to any body what he spoke to him nay he did not except his Wife and the Man made a sign with his Head importing that he would obey him for he was at that time Speechless and fear had so much influence upon him that he could not open his Mouth Thereupon the Apparition advis'd him to go to the Intendant of  Provence  and give him to know from him That he should give him Letters to introduce him to the King It represented further That it would not tell him presently what he was to say before the King but that he would appear again to him when he should come near  to  Versailles  and there teach him his Lesson  Upon that the Apparition disappear'd and left him for Dead so much was the Man frightned by his Wonders as well as by his dismal Aspect After some time the Man came to himself but so as that 'twas plain he had something extraordinary in his Head His Wife ask'd him what it was but the Prohibition laid upon him by the Apparition kept him from discovering any thing for some time At last his Wife having us'd a thousand Wheedles to make him reveal his Mind he open'd his Mouth I know not how often in order to recount the Adventure and shut it as often again by reason that the Apparition had back'd the Prohibition with such Threats as scar'd him He told his Wife That he should dye if ever he broke Silence upon the Matter and the fear that this should come to pass stiffed his Words when he was most tempted to speak  His Wife's Curiosity was inflam'd by his reserv'dness she press'd him more than ever to reveal the Secret The Husband reply'd That his Life depended upon it and that he could not do it But that Word screw'd up her Curiosity to the last degree In fine she would not let him be easie till he made the discovery and the poor Man being foolishly fond of her had no sooner acquainted her with the Apparition and the discourse that pass'd than he fell down quite Dead upon the spot Upon this the Woman was as much astonish'd as he was when the Ghost appear'd to him But after second Thoughts she constru'd the discourses he utter'd before his Death to be only the effect of a Brain disturb'd by a Mortal Sickness and told nothing of the Matter or if she did 'twas with such an Air  as if she had taken his Discovery for the Ravings of a distemper  d Brain  This Accident made no great Noise in  Salon  or the adjacent places which certainly it would if it had been fully known Nay the People there did dot so much as mind it for every one as well as his W  e believ'd that the Man's Brai  s were  ut of order when he talk'd of his Vision But at the s  me time the Vision appear'd to another Inhabitent of the same City and made him the same Compliment and he was as foolish as the other f  r he spoke of it that same day to the Curate and his indiscretion was follow'd by the same  ate for he di  d upon the spot The noise of his Death and the manner of it being spread abroad the People recall'd to their memory what was said upon the Death of the other This was the only subject of discourse all  ver  Salon  and for Leagues round it nay every body took the liberty to Comment upon it But in the mean time the Vision appear'd to a Blacksmith whose House was not far from those of the two Men I spoke of but now 'Tis possible he was as much afraid as the other two but their example being recent and of too great consequence to suffer him to be guilty of the same fault he was very attentive to the Words utter'd by the Ghost and immediately upon its disappearance went to the Intendant pursuant to its orders That Magistrate gave Audience every day to all that had any business with him so that the Smith had no occasion for any one to introduce him But his Story being such as could not well be told publickly he beg'd of him that he would retire with him to his Closet because he had an Affair of extream Consequence to imp  rt The Intendant seeing that the Man made  ut a sorry appearance could not conjecture wh  this important Affair might  be But being oblig'd to hear every one and to neglect nothing relating to his Post he desir'd him to stay a little till he had given Audience to the rest after which he would hear him at his leisure Accordingly after the general Audience was over he and the Smith retir'd to his Closet  Then the Blacksmith acquainted him That the Affair he was about to open would at first view seem to be a pure Whim and that he knew he would be dismiss'd for a Fool that to prevent such apprehensions he told him so much beforehand and in fourteen Days time he would send to see for him being then sensible of his error in treating him as a Man troubled with Maggots In fine he set forth the occasion of his coming thither namely That a Vision having appear'd a Month ago to two different Persons that certainly he had heard of upon the account of the fatal Consequences had likewise appear'd to him very lately That it had order'd him to come to the Intendant to desire he might be sent to the King That it had promis'd to appear again to him at  Versailles  or near to it in order to instruct him in what he was to say to His Majesty That accordingly he came to discharge his Commission faithfully and upon that score was not afraid of meeting with the same Fate that befel the other two  The Intendant had heard something of this odd Adventure but had always taken it for a fabulous Fiction and pursuant to that Thought check'd the Man in a strange manner He ask'd him If that was his way to abuse an Intendant's Time every minute of which he knew to be precious and at the same time gave him to know that he deserv'd nothing but a Goal The Man reply'd That his Threats made no impression upon him for that the Vision had  sufficiently prepar'd him That he would return home since the Intendant order'd him so to do and that he would only have the trouble of returning when the Intendant should send for him  Tho' the Intendant us'd him at this rate yet he had a deep impression of what he said His talking so sensibly and so unlike a distemper'd Head was sufficient to suggest some Reflection to the Intendant especially if we joyn to this the former reports of that Apparition In effect the Marshal was no sooner gone but the Intendant wrote to the Lieutenant General of  Salon  praying him to acquaint him Whether the reports of that Apparition were true or false But to prevent the communication of retractible Things he order'd him to draw up a formal Information in case he found any credit due to the reports that were spread abroad At the same time he desir'd a Character of the Man that had been with him for he had taken down his Name at first and wanted to know whether he was always reckon'd a Man of Sense such as he appear'd to be He likewise order'd him to enquire whether there ever were any of his Family either by the Father or Motherside that were Rattle brain'd For if any such had been found out by chance he had not fail'd to infer from thence that he imitated their example and by consequence that no stress was to be laid upon what he said  The Lieutenant obey'd this Letter punctually He drew up an Information and sent it to the Intendant by which he saw that all the reports of the Apparition and its consequences were true and that the Marshal was always reputed a Man of good Sense The Lieutenant likewise g  ve an account of his Family which contain'd  thing that could hinder the Intendant to  the Court with the Affair Accordingly  he Wrote of it to the Marquis of  Barbesieux  Secretary of State but he did it in such a way as signified that he only look'd upon the Man as a Madman For he did not only set forth his own incredulity upon the Matter but the Measures he had taken to prevent his being impos'd upon and sent him the Information he had caus'd to be taken at  Salon  By this he mean'd and justly indeed to justifie That if there was any imposition in the Matter he was not the first Author of it His plea was That the Magistrate of  Salon  being upon the place ought to know the Matter of Fact best upon which he concluded That if he was deceiv'd the fault ought not to lie upon him He thought himself oblig'd in a particular manner to season his Letter with a great many Circumstances to clear himself from too much Credulity in that Minister's Opinion for that the Marquis being very Young must be less Credulous than other People He knew that at such an Age as he was of such things are hardly credited and that even the Apparition of  Samuel  would meet with no Faith from them if it were not spoke of in the Books that cannot be call'd in question without Sacrilege But the Marquis was more Credulous than one would have thought He Writ him an Answer probably after speaking of it to the King importing That he might send him the Man but so as not to give any ground for charging either the one or the other with any Weakness  The Intendant receiving this Order injoyn'd the LieutenantGeneral of  Salon  to send him the Man upon the pretence of answering to the Information he had made pursuant to his Order Accordingly the Blacksmith waited upon him and told him at first meeting That he had said before 'twould not be long before he sent for him again The Intendant made answer That he did  not send for him upon the design he thought of but to reprimand him for meaning to impose upon him By this Representation he thought to turn the Tables upon him in order to satisfie the Marquis's caution But the Man knowing that he was guilty of nothing that could merit a reprimand the Conference ended in this That the Intendant gave him to know that if he were as much perswaded of the Fact as he would have him believe he would be so far from hindring him to go to  V  sailles  that he would give him IntroductoryLetters to the Marquis of  Barbesieux  and to facilitate his Journey would give him a place in the first RecruitConvoy that was to go that way The Man did not care which way he went so he could but satisfie the desire of the Vision and accordingly agreed to what was propos'd There was a Company of Recruits just ready to be gone which an Officer of the Town of  had rais'd and which were to pass near  Paris  The Intendant recommended the Blacksmith to him and gave him some Mony to give him when he par  d from him That Officer carry'd him to  erte  under  J  narre  after having Wrote to the Intendant in obedience to his Command That he could  nothing in the Man but what bec  me a Wi  e man For the Intendant had desir'd him to observe him narrowly upon the Road to the end that if he discover'd any turn of Thought in him he might acquaint the Marquis o  Barbesieux  with it  The Blacksmith being thus arriv'd at  ert  took leave o  the Officer and repair  d to  Versailles  where he did not knew what to  ay because the Ghost had not yet appear  d to him But the very Night that he arriv'd while he was in great perplexity he heard as he says one undraw his Curtain while he was full awake Upon that the Ghost appear'd to him bid him fea  nothing and gave him to know That both the Secretary of State and the King would give him a Wellcome Reception notwithstanding the difficulties he met with at first Being thus instructed in what he was to say both to the Marquis and the King he was at the same time strictly charg'd never to divulge what was then told him to any body excepting His Majesty The Ghost acquainted him That the Marquis of  Barbesieux  would endeavour by all means to pump the Secret out of him but that he was to conceal it from him as well as from every body else for if he fail'd in that piece of Obedience he should infallibly meet with the same Fate as befel the two Men in his Town  The Ghost disappear'd immediately and the Blacksmith having no great inclination to Sleep longer went in the morning to wait upon the Marquis of  Barbesieux  and deliver'd him the Intendant's Letter The Marquis immediately call'd him to his Closet where they both continu'd for above an hour The report of the Blacksmith's ensuing Arrival had been spread all over the Court before he came For upon his departure from  Provence  Letters were sent to Town and he was every where stil'd  The Prophet  forasmuch as no body doubted but that he was going to Prophesie something to the King and had undertook that Journey only for that end In the mean time every body was mightily desirous to know what the Matter was and there being always some that pretend to refine upon Things beyond their Neighbours a Report was spread abroad That he had been put upon at the same rate as  James Clement  in former Times tho' not in order to commit such a detestable Action as he did but to acquaint His Majesty under so fair a covert a great many things that could not otherwise reach his Ears I do not speak this as if I  believ'd it for I know very well that these are only pleasant Whims familiar to those who for want of business employ their whole time in Commenting upon whatever happens  However according to the Ghost's Prediction the Marquis of  Barbesieux  endeavour'd to work the Secret out of the Blacksmith But the Smith reply'd That all his efforts upon that score would be fruitless in regard he had a Lesson prescrib'd to him which he was oblig'd to observe under the pain of being punish'd upon the spot but to shew that his advances were not Chimerical he might give His Majesty to know That the last time he Hunted at  Fontainbleau  he was suddenly surpriz'd with an Apparition which put him into a great astonishment That the same Ghost which appear'd to him had at that time appear'd to His Majesty and that his Horse had seen it and started aside as if he would have thrown him That the Apparition did not continue above a moment which occasion'd His Majesty's apprehension of being mistaken and his speaking of it to no body and that all this hapned to His Majesty only in order to procure him access to the King by shewing That he knew what none else in his Dominions was acquainted with Upon these reasons he hop'd His Majesty would make no difficulty in giving him Audience  The Marquis of  Barbesieux  was much surpriz'd at the hearing of such a Circumstance as that which would quickly discover whether there was any thing Supernatural in this Man's Pretensions or whether he was an Impostor And in earnest if the King confirm'd the Matter of Fact undoubtedly he must have known something beyond a Natural Capacity The Marquis acquainted the King with his Arrival and with the Story he told and all he had said being as 'tis  alledg'd found true the King granted him a private Audience What pass'd in this Interview nobody can tell because 'twas kept as a profound Secret All we know is That the pretended Prophet having stay'd some days at Court while few knew that he had the honour to speak with the King His Majesty agreed that he should come and take leave of him publickly when he took Coach to go a Hunting The Duke of  Duas  Captain of the LifeGuard no sooner saw him but he told the King That if he had not order'd him to admit such a Fellow to approach His Person he had been far from doing it because he was certainly a Fool or else His Majesty was much put upon A great many others about Court were of his Mind for people are not easily convinc'd of such things as these But the King took his part and gave the Captain to know that he was out in his Judgment and that he had more Sense than he thought for  This Expression was evidence that he had told the King some very odd Things for otherwise the King would never have given himself the trouble to make such Declaration of his Thoughts It awak'd the Curiosity of all Mankind and everybody would have given any thing to know the result of his Conference with His Majesty and  Barbesieux  The Marquis's Friends pump'd him upon the matter but he told 'em frankly that 'twas in vain in regard there was something in the matter that challeng'd his Secrecy The vulgar People who are naturally very credulous fancy'd that his Business with the King was to Preach up the suppression of the Imposts that Necessity had oblig'd him to lay upon 'em in the time of so cruel a War The Prophet having taken leave of the King return'd to his own Country and the Marquis of  Barbesieux  having given him Mony at his arrival and order'd him to converse  with no body repeated his Bounty to him when he went So that the Prophet spoke nothing of the matter to anybody while he was there and indeed he could not well do it if he would for he was always kept within view  Such an extraordinary Adventure as this did not fail to make a great deal of noise all over  Paris  and even the whole Kingdom but notwithstanding that the appearance of Prodigies ought to make People reflect upon their Duty yet I do not find that this made any Reformation of Manners Debauchery continued still to Reign among Men and Women and the exemplary Piety of the King and part of the Court had no effect upon the Libertine Spirits His Majesty who ever since his application to Devotion has made it his Business to extirpate Vice not only out of those about his Person but even those who live at a distance held at that time a Council of Conscience at which the Archbishop of  Paris  and some other Prelates with Father  de la Cha  se  his Confessor were call'd to assist In that Assembly several methods were propos'd for preventing the usual disorders among the Officers and Soldiers The Archbishop of  Paris  being a very z  lous Man cry'd up His Majesty's pious Intention and gave the rest to understand that they ought to joyn all their Force in bringing it to bear For this purpose 'twas propos'd That a Missionary should be sent to each Regiment in order to Preach to 'em and Catechise 'em every day But it being answer'd That Missionaries would scarce be  ound to undertake the Office by reason of their necessary Residence with the Regiments another motion was made and agreed to I know not indeed whether it has yet produc'd the desired effect but what is not yet done may be done here after and that Time will discover The mo+tion was That none should be imploy'd as Al+moners  of Regiments but those who are Persons of pious and good Lives and who have Men of Merit to vouch for 'em And that at the conclusion of every Campagne they should be oblig'd to repair to the Seminaries and continue there all Winter To speak the truth I must say this is an effectual Scheme for having no Almoners but such as are quite different from what they now are But I question if they'll find any that will submit to that sort of Life Most people put in for those Places only to divert themselves and as soon as they find what constraint is mean'd 'em they'll rather desert than submit to it Probably that is the reason that the Thing is not yet put in Execution and perhaps never will  While measures were concerting for the introducing of such excellent Discipline among the Troops one of these Almoners being imprison'd by the King's Order in one of the Hospitals for the Poor made a strange End after a very odd Life He was a Recollet by Trade but being uneasy under the confinement of a Convent he procur'd a Dismission under the pretence of serving in this Imployment which by Intrigues and the Interest of Friends he had obtain'd He had continued in that Office some time and as those who are once in any measure Corrupted do quickly become more Corrupt in an Army so he form'd a design to render himself so necessary at Court by a false Accusation that he might be in a capacity to throw off his Habit which he  r  with as much uneasiness as formerly he did the confinement of the Cloyster He had his eye upon one Abbot  Agnan  who of a Fryer had made himself a Chymist Physician He had a strong mind to follow his Example not in practising Physick which he did not understand but in wearing the Habit of a secular Priest instead of that of a Religious one His Plea was  That since they had allow'd that Abbot to dispense with his Vows upon the pretence of some Cures he might obtain the same favour by some signal Service Upon that view he repair'd to the Marquis of  Chateauneuf  Secretary of State who manag'd the Affairs of Religion and privately acquainted him That an Officer of the Regiment to which he was Almoner had a design upon the King's Life He knew that  that  Officer was oblig'd to go off then or next morning to some forreign Country as well as a great many others who would not change their Religion Nay he had counsel'd him so to do and promis'd to come and see him tho' he mean'd nothing less  The Marquis of  Chateauneuf  who is in many things the least of all the four Secretaries of State if it be Lawful to call any thing  little  that's about so great a Prince sent Orders immediately to Arrest the Officer and commanded the Recollet to continue at Court In the mean time the Officer was gone which the Recollet knew very well However the Marquis being inform'd of his Departure told the Recollet he was come too late and that the Bird was flown three days before The Recollet made Answer That  that  was none of his fault and that he could not do the Business sooner That after all he believ'd he was only gone to  Languedoc  his Native Country where he would be sure to keep close and that in regard he told him most of his haunts he believ'd he could unkennel him if the Marquis would sent him to that Country The Marquis continued still to believe what he said and accordingly he send him to  Languedoc  where the Recollet arriv'd very speedily with the Mony he had got for the Charge of the Journey He had a permission upon his going out of  Paris  to put on a Gentleman's Habit But at last having drill'd on the Affair as long as he could the  Minister of State not offering to incourage him any longer he return'd to this City where he was inform'd that the Marquis design'd to take him up The Marquis begun to see thro' his Knavety and would not suffer himself to be impos'd upon any longer The Recollet came to know this piece of News very luckily It fe  l out by chance that in the very Inn at which he alighted there was one of the Cousins of the Person he had accus'd to whom Mr  de Chateauneuf  had communicated his Thoughts Now this Relation had told Mr  deChateauneuf  that his Cousin was indeed a true Protestant but he could be Surety that he was not capable of the Thought he was charg'd with At the same time he had wrote to his Cousin to know the truth of the thing upon which the Officer receiving such information wrote himself to Mr  de Chateauneuf  setting forth That he was ready to return to  France  to clear himself of the Accusation if the King would grant him a Passport and Assurance that he should not be troubled upon the score of his retiring to a foreign Counntry contrary to his Prohibition  This Letter was but just receiv'd and the Relation having been at  Versailles  that day told all the People about the Inn the whole Story as a piece of acceptable News But the Recollet was wiser than to discover what hand he had in the matter Upon that he drop'd his Design of going to wait upon Mr  Chateauneuf  and took up at another Inn under a different Name from what he had before Nay further he bought such a Cross as the Knights of  Malta  wear and put a white Feather in his Hat and went by the Title of Mr  le Chevalier  The People of the first Inn  seeing him next day were surpriz'd for that  had told them nothing of his going But  the Officer's Kinsman had never suspected  him if the Recollet had not said at Table that he came from  Languedoc  for somebody telling him so much happen'd by way of Jest to say That perhaps he was the Man he had been speaking of and for that reason had deserted the Inn Upon this the Kinsman return'd next day to  Versailles  to know what sort of a Man the Recollet was Mr  Chateauneuf  's Description agreeing exactly with what he had seen he acquainted the Minister with what pass'd at Table and with the suspicion that he grounded thereupon Immediately the Secretary gave such express Orders for searching all the Inns in  Paris  that the Recollet could scarce escape For the excellent Orders we have in this City with reference to all strangers whether in Inns or private Lodgings are so admirably well calculated that 'tis no great difficulty to make a narrow Enquiry All the Landlords being obliged to give an account who are their Lodgers and when they arriv'd the Commissary of the Ward where the pretended Knight lodg'd was informed by the Innkeeper that he had got a new Guest Thereupon the Commissary observing the time of his arrival to jump with that of the suspected Person's he inform'd himself of his Features and so took him up so that his pretended Knighthood was not sufficient to keep him  Incognito  Presently he was convey'd either to the  Bastile  or  Vincennes  where he endeavoured to make his escape but being prevented and being at the same time guilty of a horrid piece of Sacrilege he was indited according to his demerit The Recollets interceeded for him to prevent the mortification of its being said in the World That one of their Society was either Hang'd or Burnt The King graciously granted their request and exchang'd the Sentence of Death for that of perpetual Imprisonment So  he was put into the Hospital I spoke of but now but he was no sooner got in than he made a new Conspiracy with the other Russians to make their escape now this could scarce be effected without Killing him that brought 'em their Victuals But that being not the first Crime they had all been guilty of they mutually agreed that they should not stand to do it In effect they committed the Murder and having made their escape fled to the  Palais Royal  where they had an acquaintance by whom they expected to be entertain'd But their Acquaintance abhorring the Crime they had committed and knowing they had broke the Prison to which they had been committed by the King's Orders refus'd to receive 'em Thus they were oblig'd to look out for another hiding Place But the GoalKeeper being already at their Heels they were quickly retaken and Tried The poor Recollet by vertue of the Interest of his Order was only Condemned to the Galleys but God not contented with this Punishment which was infinitely short of his demerit did so order it that the Gang offering to revolt against their Keepers about fifteen or twenty Leagues from  Paris  these shot upon 'em and Kill'd the wretched Recollet Such was his End and the King having notice of it was the more forward in reforming the Almoners of the Army for that he knew 'twas in that capacity that he first began to signalize himself by Debauchery and Corruptness  In the mean time we receiv'd the News of the King of  Sweden  's Death which gave the Potentates that desir'd a Peace some occasion to fear some obstacle or delay But tho' his Successor was very young and 'twas to be feared that a great many Turmoils might fall out in that Kingdom during his Minority yet his Father's Will was so well order'd that it put  all to rights His Son was declar'd to be  Major  or of Age before the usual Term in  Sweden  in order to discourage those who mean'd to disturb the State At the same time the young King's Grandmother being declar'd his Guardian by her Son's Will took upon her the Administration of the Government The late King had nominated some Counsellors to assist her among the rest the Count of  Bielke  a zealous favourer of the House of  Austria  who had been formerly Ambassador at the Court of  France  and was disoblig'd there However it being fear'd that he might endeavour to disturb our Game perhaps as much out of private resentment as any intention to serve the Crown of  Spain  Count  d'Avaux  the most Christian King's Ambassador in that Country had orders to have a watchful Eye upon his Conduct I know not whether it was the bad Offices done him by Count  d'Avaux  or his being guilty of several unwarrantable Practices when he was Governor of  Pomeren  that brought him quickly to be disgrac'd but in fine he perceiving that he was like to sink under the Power of his Enemies wrote to one of his Nephews in  France  to intreat his Maiesty to forget what was past and grant him the honour of his Protection Immediately upon the receipt of the Letter his Nephew spoke of it to the King And the Count's hopes were not frustrated for the King allowed him to come to  France  pursuant to his request but the Letter by which his Nephew gave him this Advice being intercepted by some of his Enemies he was taken up  At that time Mr  Lasun  had only two Occupations namely Pleading and Gaming But as he grew Old Fortune which only serves Youth became as unfavourable to him as it had formerly been kind 'Twas computed that in  the space of three or four Months he lost above sixty thousand Pistols 'Tis certain he lost a great deal but it being known that sixty thousand Pistols in the  Gascogne  way of speaking does not amount to above five or six thousand others concluded that his loss might terminate there He was likewise cast in a LawSuit against Madam  Fremont  and her Son and was more cast down upon that than upon his loss at Game for he still hop'd to regain the latter but the Judgment against him excluded all hopes of relief Besides he was troubled that he had made such a noise about it both at Court and in the City without better success All his Friends endeavoured to comfort him and to speak the truth they were not much dissatisfied with the rub he met with because they hop'd it would facilitate his Accommodation with Marshal  de Lorges  and his Lady But stiffness is so natural to old People that their hopes vanish'd in Smoak He was a turbulent sort of a Man all his Lifetime insomuch that he oftentimes thwarted the King and he would not then disclaim that Quality tho' indeed 'twas none of the best The Judgment pronounced against him related only to the Question whether he was to plead before the Court of  Aydes  or that of  Requests  Now being remitted to the last which was the thing he only wanted to avoid he resolv'd to plead his Cause there tho' he should meet with the same success that happen'd to him in  Ireland  Tho' after all' I know not what reason he had to fear any such thing for he shew'd by his Carriage before them that he fear'd K  William  uch less than them  However he was not the only Courtier that lov'd to be litigious The P of  Epinois  follow'd his Example very close He commenc'd a Suit before the Council against the Prince of  Bournonville  for the succession to the Vicounty of  Gand  to which they were equally related The case had been already decided by the Parliament of  Rouan  in favour of the Prince of  Bournonville  But great Lords are more liable to the pursuit of ill Causes than others because their Intendants and Agents want only to have 'em ingag'd to a disadvantage that they may fish in troubled Waters His true Friends gave him to know That they fear'd he would he cast before the Council as well as before the Parliament Upon this he redoubled his Sollicitations hoping by his Intrigues and diligence to gain what he was apprehensive of losing in the Court of Justice The two Princesses his Wife and his Mother took care likewise to make use of their Friends His Wife endeavoured to perswade 'em that she desired nothing but Justice hoping to blind 'em by their respect for her Quality But the Mother was less presumptuous whether 'twas that she thought she was no longer to be consider'd as a Princess having the Reputation of being married to a Lawyer or that she was sensible of the weakness of her Son's Cause Accordingly she confin'd her hopes to the Interest of her pretended Husband The P of  Bournonville  for his part was not asleep being sensible that he had to do with a strong party But 'twould be a great folly in Judges to have more regard to Interest than Justice and all that the Prince  D'Epinois  and his whole Family could do could not prevent his being fin'd and oblig'd to pay the Costs Indeed the Debate lasted above  five Hours because some of the Judges had a mind to oblige 'em  The Countess of  Grignan  being then at  Paris  went to see the Dutchess of  Orleans  at St  Cloud  who had Dislocated her Arm by a Fall from her Horse at Hunting But she was so ill receiv'd that she did not care to go again for a long time That Princess came to that House after her Arm had been set by a Country Surgeon that perform'd his Office not amiss But being still much Pain'd she was so angry at the Countess's saying to her That she came to Congratulate the dispelling of her Illness that she was very near kicking her out of her Presence The Princess who seldom disguises Nature check'd her so severely that the Countess upon her return to  Paris  made it known to all her Friends and the Duke of  Orleans  came to hear of it His Royal Highness told his Lady That she was in the wrong but she was so uncapable of listning to Reason in the case she was in that there was a necessity of waiting till she was well before she could be convinced of an Error in having us'd that Lady at sueh a rate  The Month of  August  came on soon after and the Jesuits in pursuance of their  usual Custom had a Tragedy Acted in their College of  Louis le Grand  So 'tis now call'd the Names of the The College of  Clermont  or of  Jesus  being quite sunk The Passion that the good Fathers had for insinuating themselves in the King's Favour made them prefer Flattery to Gratitude They have forgot that their Founders oblig'd them to put their Name upon the Gate and have put up another in its place which indeed is infinitely greater and more illustrious than  Clermont  's but at the same time did not want Panegyrists enough besides them to transmit it with Honour to Posterity So that the World did not pardon such an Action for they had no sooner taken down the Name of  Jesus  from above their great Gate than two Latin Verses were Published which are well enough known in the World but there being several that have not seen them 'twill not be altogether improper to insert them here and to preserve the Memory of them if it were capable to be lost They are as followeth  Sustulit hinc Jesum Posuit{que} insignia Regis  Impia Genes alium non habt illa Deum  The meaning of these Verses is That this Society in which Impiety reigns took down the Name of Jesus and put up the King's Arms and so never recogniz'd any other God than the Kings of the Earth I am very far from saying that this is a truth Nay I should rather affirm that Piety reigns among 'em instead of Impiety but considering that they have many Enemies we must not be surpris'd if they have recourse to some Imposture or other when the smallest Faults they can be guilty of are charg'd upon 'em with Reproach However  Monsieur  being invited to the abovemention'd Tragedy he and the whole Court honour'd it with their Presence upon which Father  Jai  who has a great Genius for that sort of Representation complimented him on the behalf of the Rector of that College setting forth that if the Performance pleas'd him all the Honour of it was due to him The good Father made a long tedious Speech screwing in several Panegyricks upon the late Duke of  S Agnan  who was not only a great lover of Acting but so good an Actor that upon occasion he acted all the different Parts one after another Having spoke all that he had to say he took leave and went to cause the Representation to be begun But when every one was pricking up his Ears that they might not lose one word of the Performance this mighty Inventer fell out with his Fidlers insomuch that instead of Playing they put up their Instruments and offer'd to go away Father  Jai  being touch'd with the Affront they thus put upon him preach'd to 'em and catechiz'd 'em in order to make 'em alter their Resolution But after he had thus acted the part of a Preacher a Trade that in the mean time he knew nothing of he at last came to threaten 'em with his Arms where his greater Excellency lay He gave the Musicians to know that the least they could expect was to have their Instruments broke over their Heads But all this did  not soften them They still insisted on their Resolution to be gone so that the poor Father was forc'd to have recourse to  Monsieur  to make 'em comply Accordingly  Monsieur  interpos'd his Authority and the Musicians did for him what they refus'd to do for the Father Then the Tragedy was begun but its end was much of a piece with the Prelude For several People quarell'd and were so warm that they stood in need of  Monsieur  's Authority to restrain 'em However the Matter was accommodated without  Monsieur  's Intervention and the King who loves to be inform'd of all that passes in  Paris  or  Versailles  no sooner had an account of the Adventures at this Tragedy but he said a word of  Monsieur  that sounded well enough He turn'd to some Lords that were laughing at this Adventure and said  The Court had been long a Sufferer by the less of the Duke of  S Agnan  but thank God  Monsieur  was about to repair their loss  In effect this Duke was all his lifelong a Judge among the Musicians of  Paris  he was so far from thinking that Office to be beneath his Quality that on the other hand he thought nothing more proper for him pleading that the Players on the Violin not only contributed to Gallantry but were in a manner the necessary Instruments to carry it on and thinking that himself exceeded all other Men in Gallantry he upon that score laid claim to the Government of them entitling himself to a preference to all others  The Bishop of  Orleans  did not keep his Anger long whether it was that he was sensible of his Error in being angry or that he was not apt to continue a Resentment long He return'd to  Paris  whither he brought his Nephew But his Nephew who would not sacrifice his Hopes of a Bishoprick to the love he had for his Uncle renew'd his Addresses to Father  de la Chaise  and to the King At that time several Bishopricks were Vacant and among others  the Bishoprick of  Mentz  which is none of the most inconsiderable Sees in the Kingdom for besides that the Bishop of that place is at the same time Prince of the Empire and has a right to put the Sword as well as the Mitre in his Arms like the Ecclesiastick Electors the Bishop of  Munster  and several other Princes his Incomes amount to almost Livres a Year The eldest Brother of the late Duke of  Feuillade  had succeeded to it when the Duke of  Verneuil  who had enjoy'd it from his Youth married Duke  Sulli  's Widow The Abbot of  Coaslin  scarce made any Pretensions to it in consideration of what had pass'd But the King who commonly takes pleasure in granting unexpected Favours bestow'd that Dignity upon him to the great astonishment of all  France  and even of his own Family This entirely put an end to what chagrin the Bishop of  Orleans  retain'd upon the score of the Bank However his Majesty who never does a Favour by halves observing that neither this new Prelate nor his Family were in a Condition to raise the Crowns that he was oblig'd to send to  Rome  for his Bulls his Majesty I say taking this into Consideration intreated the Pope by a Letter under his own Hand to let this Prelate have his Bulls  gratis  If the King had gratified him with this rich Benefice five or six Months later than he did he might have sav'd himself the trouble of writing to  Rome  for the Bishop of  Orleans  was made Cardinal before that time and the Cardinal's Nephews never pay for their Bulls that being a Privilege among many others that is tack'd to the Purple The Pope did not deny his Majesty so small a Request so that the new Bishop receiving his Bulls  gratis  was suddenly capable to keep his Father's Coach from being seiz  d again Since our Parents are the first Poor that we ought to relieve and since his Father wanted his Assistance 'twas his Duty to begin with him in the Dispensation of his Wealth  The  Tuilleries  are the place of Rendezvous for all the Persons of Quality of Fortune in  Paris  And at present 'tis a Custom among the Ladies as well as the Gentlemen to keep Footmen from to Years of Age and commonly at the Gates and Doors there stands such a numerous quantity of Footmen as upon occasion would make a Recruit of or Men Now these Gentlemen Lacquies having the daily Opportunity of seeing the Freaks and Intrigues of their Mistrisses and having no great reason to entertain a very good Opinion of 'em one may know the History of each Lady by hearing their Conferences At that time one of these Comical Fellows said to his Fellow Servants that if they would give him a Bottle of Wine he would lift up the Coats of the first Lady that came out They readily agreed to give that reward for such a nice piece of Diversion In the mean time Mademoiselle  d' Armagnac  and the Marchioness  de Villequier  came out together and the Footman probably not knowing who they were offer'd to perform upon them the Insolence he had promis'd The Ladies surpriz'd with the unaccountable Brutality cry'd out for help and stopp'd the Footman themselves several Persons of Quality alighting from their Coaches assisted them to prevent the Fellow's making his Escape upon this he was imprison'd▪ Some Judges were for putting him to Death to scare those of his Kidney from such lewdness but others thought the Pillory and the Gallies a sufficient Punishment for what he had done And thus he was only order'd to go and serve the King in the Gallies though to speak the truth his Insolence deserv'd another sort of usage However that wretched sort of Cattel entertain'd the Publick very often with Scenes of this nature which were still worse when they wore Swords Every day they were guilty of some Insolence or other and there was a great deal of reason for forbidding 'em  the use of Swords The occasion of that Prohibition was the Father of Monsieur  Tilladet  whom they kill'd and so stopp'd the Course of his Fortune which perhaps would have gone further than that of his Children because he had married the Sister of the late Monsieur  le Tellier  'Tis true he was not always in good terms with him That Minister whose Projects bore a Proportion to his Fortune pretended to Marry his Sister better than to a little Gentleman of  Gascony  But young Ladies often Marry without their Friends Consent and she particularly dispos'd of her self without consulting him upon the matter This was the occasion of their misunderstanding But as time sinks all Differences so his Brotherinlaw and he were good Friends when that accident happen'd  At that time the Dutchess of  Feuillade  dy'd and her Death was not much regreated by her Husband who if we believe the common Report liv'd so indifferently with her that he never injoy'd her But though he did not lament her loss all that knew her did for she was a very amiable Lady and never gave any occasion to talk of her Besides she was very Young being not above Years of Age But there are some invincible Antipathies and 'tis plain the Duke was not of a Temper suitable to her since he did not respect what all the World pronounc'd lovely It seems he likewise despis'd her Alliance though to speak the truth there were a great many of as good Families as his at least who would willingly have married Ladies that had not so much to boast of as she For if 'tis true that a Family is render'd Illustrious by the past or present Possession of great Places we shall scarce find one in the Kingdom at least retaining to the Law that could equal this It produc'd six or seven Secretaries of State and at present boasts of three This Lady was the Daughter of the Marquiss of  Chateauneuf  who indeed is but a little  Secretary of State in comparison with the other three But as there are no little Saints in Paradise because God who is infinitely Great communicates somewhat of himself to those who have serv'd him faithfully so there's no such thing as a little Secretary of State under the greatest King in  Christendom  Mean while Marshal  Boufflers  and my Lord  Portland  having remov'd a great many Difficulties by their Conferences the King in concert with the Emperor propos'd to keep  Strasbourg  and to give up to his Imperial Majesty that Part of  Brisack  that lies beyond the  Rhine  The City of  Strasbourg  did not belong to the Emperor and by right it ought to have return'd to the Inhabitants who were Proprietors of it before the King had it This Innovation did not please the Princes of the Empire especially those situated on this side the  Rhine  or just by the other But great Princes do not much mind little ones when their own Interest is in the case and upon that foot the Consent of the King of  England  was enough to make it bear 'Tis alledg'd that that Prince consented to it only upon the hopes that his satisfying the King of  France  in a thing that he desir'd so passionately would move his most Christian Majesty to give him another recompence that he on the other side was as eager to obtain He did not like King  James  's continuing at St  Germains  thinking that place to lie too near  Versailles  And upon a parallel Case  Cromwell  who was not short of him in Politicks us'd all his Interest in his time to oblige his Majesty to remove from his Court not only the late King  Charles  who after his Father's Misfortune had fled to  Paris  but likewise the Queen his Mother Accordingly he obtain  d his end with reference to King  Charles  and even the Duke of  York  his Brother who had likewise fled thither but as to the Queen he could never gain his Point there notwithstanding that he wheedled Cardinal  Mazarin  with the Proposal of a  Marriage between his own Son and one of the Cardinal's Nieces For that Princess made a vigorous Opposition against this Minister's Proposal of her removal from the Court of  France  and would never consent to it notwithstanding the great Advantages accruing to her upon that Condition particularly a large Pension from  England  My Lord  Portland  gave the Marshal some hint of his Master's Design with a good Address The Marshal who is not so much a Statesman as a good Servant to the King had nevertheless Sense enough upon this Occasion to give him some hopes of succeeding without going too far However People being always apt to flatter themselves my Lord was perswaded That the King could not refuse what King  William  desir'd after the Condescention in the Affair of  Strasbourg  and nothing was thought of upon both sides but the Execution of what these two Ministers should agree upon The Princes of the Empire were still displeas'd they could not forbear complaining that the Article relating to  Strasbourg  was contrary to the Preliminaries of the Peace they knew very well that the first thing demanded of Monsieur  Cailleres  before the Commencement of the Conferences with him was the Restitution of  Lorrain Strasbourg  and  Luxembourg  The Emperor's Ministers answer'd to this That the King's Conquest of  Barcelona  had chang'd the Face of Affairs that he demanded an Equivalent and that considering how things stood 'twas well for them that he was contented with so little They were glad they had this Pretence to cover the Advantage accruing to their Master by that new Proposal In fine they saw very well that after all  Europe  had drain'd it self in carrying on the War the House of  Austria  were the only Gainers by it But the Princes of the Empire who did not approve of these Reasons could not comply so easily with the Proposal They sollicited the Emperor and  the Mediators to get that Clause alter'd that seem'd to be so disadvantageous to them His Imperial Majesty did not mind them for that in granting their Request he should have acted contrary to his own Interest The Mediators gave no other excuse but that all  Europe  stood equally in need of a Peace and that the Cession of all on this side of the  Rhine  and stipulating a Restitution of all on the other side was the best Expedient both to put a speedy end to the present War and to prevent a future Rupture  Neither their Answer nor that of the Emperors gave 'em any Satisfaction They fansy'd the Mediators were influenc'd by  France  at least they perswaded themselves that if the late King of  Sweden  had been still alive he would never have tamely suffer'd things to pass so Being thus prepossess'd with the apprehension of the great Prejudice accruing to them from the Peace they did not comply very early While the respective Parties were busi'd in managing their several Pretensions the Affairs of  Poland  were brought to that Confusion that 'twas thought they would never be adjusted without a Civil War Th  Cardinal Primate sent a Courier to  France  to know what was the reason that the Prince of  Conti  did not come to take the Crown upon his Head He represented that his Interest suffer'd mightily by his apparent Indifferency in lying quiet at  Par  s  or the Court at a time when  Poland  was in a Combustion out of Respect and Love to him That the Duke of  Saxony  was not wanting in reaping a mighty Advantage by it that he debauch d those of his Party upon the Plea that 'twould be folly to adhere any longer to a  Prince  that deserted 'em in that manner that his Presence in  Poland  was desir'd beyond Expression and that on the other hand the Duke of  Saxony  was so hated that upon the Prince's Arrival every body would side with him out of spite to the other  The Abbot of  Polignac  gave the Court to know as much by every Courier he sent At last the King having call'd a Council upon the matter resolv'd that the Prince of  Conti  should go immediately to that Country And in regard he could not expect a good Reception without carrying Money with him his Majesty gave him Bills of Exchange for besides  Louisd'ores  for petty Occasions The Peace was then not made and 'twas possible it might fail by reason of the Interest of the Princes of the Empire who still oppos'd it with great Warmth and Resolution Upon this account 'twas question'd by many how the Prince should get with safety into  Poland  To go there  incognito  was at once dishonourable and dangerous and to do it by open force was impossible the Enemies Fleet being at Sea which all the Power of  France  could not cope with But notwithstanding the Strength of their Fleet the Kng fitted out Squadrons every Day which not only got off clear but were continually annoying them by taking Prizes And accordingly a Squadron was order'd to Transport the Prince  John Bart  having taken upon him to Conduct the Prince took care to make the Squadron ready by Orders from Court 'Twas fitted out at  Dunkirk  and the Allies having notice of it sent Ships to that Road to hinder any thing to go in or come out This Obstacle did not amuse  John Bart  though another would have been much perplex'd with it 'Tis not known how the Enemy had such an early Intelligence of the Design for the King kept it so secret that no body in  France  knew of it till within two Days before the time of his Departure However it seems it came by Spies of which they had a great many every where especially at the SeaPorts  But that Trade was more hazardous than  Bart  's Expedition though at the same time it was attended by a great deal of Danger For one of these Spie  was taken up not long before in the same place where this Squadron was fitted out and considering the risque he run 'tis not imaginable how little he got by it One  Couture  a  Paris  Councellor a Man of little Practice and a narrow Fortune being inveigled by a Woman that either had debauch'd him or had been debauch'd by him went a strowling up and down the Country with her There he try'd several Trades that did not agree very well with the Bar but being bred to Harangue and Declaim he at last listed himself among a Company of strowling Actors which after a great many turnings and windings brought him to the  French Flanders  there he acted his Parts and coming afterwards to  Dunkirk  met there with a Man that having known him at  Paris  represented to him the scandalousness of his Imployment The CounsellorActor made answer  That 'twas easy to talk of things but when a Man had nothing he was oblig'd to do what he could  Thereupon his Friend gave him to know that if he would trust him he would find him a better Trade in which he might earn his Bread with less Labour The Counsellor being not oversatisfied with the Trade he was then in took him at his word upon which his Friend said  They behov'd to drink together before he could speak farther upon the Matter  Having carried him to a Tavern he acquainted him over a Glass That he had several Relations in  Holland  who were great Traders and were every day annoy'd with the Prizes made by the  French  Ships that they would willingly give Livers a Year to any Man that would engage to give 'em timely notice what Ships are fitting out from  Dunkirk  and St  Maloes  that if he would find a Friend to reside in one of these places while himself continued in the other he would see that Sum paid him and that there was no great Difficulty or Labour in the performance of what was desir'd 'Tis possible he likewise set forth to him that in undertaking  that Office he would do a charitable Action by preserving so many honest Men from Ruin However the Counsellor accepted the offer and settled one  Martin  for his Subdelegate at St  Maloes  allowing him Livres a Year Himself continued at  Dunkirk  waiting till he could find out another Deputy for the same price that so he might go to  Paris  and there injoy the remaining Livres of his Pension Accordingly he found one in a little time But his other Deputy Mr  Martin  being a Man of no great Head and his Office requiring an Infinity of Sense and Precaution he was soon suspected by the Inhabitants of St  Maloes  Tho' he colour'd his Residence in that place with a pretence of some small Commerce and Trade that he had taken up only for a feint yet they observing his Diligence and Curiosity in going every Day to the Haven to see what was done there immediately gave the Court notice of him The Court sent Orders to have a watchful Eye upon him At last their Suspicion being still inflam'd by his Conduct they stopp'd his Letters at the Posthouse which were address'd to  Couture  at one Madam  Clerc  's in  Paris  At the same time Letters were sent to  Couture  from his other Correspondent at  Dunkirk  Both these were open'd and afterwards seal'd so artificially that he could not discover it They observ'd that both the Correspondents made mention of some Naval Preparations at these two places and were very particular in their Accounts After that 'twas found that the use he made of their Intelligence was to convey the same to  Holland  This being sufficient Evidence they were all three taken up Poor  S Martin  fearing to be broken on the Wheel or at least hang'd would not stay till he was examin'd but threw himself headlong over a Rock upon which he was imprison'd  Couture  's Mother having married a CouncilBarrister for her second Husband had so much Interest at Court as to get  her Son's Punishment converted into perpetual Imprisonment By which means the  Dunkirk  Deputy got off at the same rate And so there was an end of the Story  To return 'Tis very probable the Enemy discover'd Monsieur  Bart  's Design by some such means However the  Ships coming before  Dunkirk  watch'd Night and Day for fear the Man that had already trick'd 'em so often should boast once more of playing them a new trick The day before the Prince's Departure the King was two Hours with him in private in the Castle of  Marli  and there being no Witnesses of what past between 'em we can only make Conjectures about it What can we imagine it to be unless we say That his Majesty who is so well vers'd in the Art of Government gave him Lessons how to behave upon his Arrival in the Kindgdom he was call'd to in case the Subjects should prove as affectionate as they were represented to be as well as in case they should prove otherwise which the Prince was very apprehensive of For all their Intelligence from  Poland  by any other Hands than the Cardinal Primate and the Abbot of  Polignac  gave a contrary Account of things to what these two Ministers did All the Merchants Letters from  Dantzick  and the other neighbouring Places spoke of nothing but of the great number of Creatures retaining to the Duke of  Sax  ny  The Letters that came to the Marchioness of  Bethunes  spoke to the same purpose but when any body ask'd her what they contain'd she spoke as dubiously as she could leaving them to guess more than she had a mind to tell Those who were quicksighted knew the cause of her Silence but they made no use of it knowing that one is never thank'd for telling disagreeable News  All this did not hi  der the Prince to set out He took with him no Persons of Note or Distinction unless you put the  Chevalier  's  de Lausun  and  Sill  ri  in that Rank but the one being as poor as a Rat let his Family be what it will and the other being a Cadet as well as he and one whose Family has nothing but a Chancellor for its greatest Ornament I thought I might dispense with the giving 'em that Title The latter assum'd the Name of Count  Silleri  at his Departure either because he hop'd the Prince of  Conti  whose Domestick he was would raise him to a great Fortune now he was call'd to a Throne or because having declar'd his Marriage with the Daughter of an Auditor of the Accounts that brought him some Money he had a mind to leave her a more honourable Title than that of a Chevalier's Lady The Eve before the Prince's Departure he receiv'd the Visits of all the Court who came to take leave of him At Night he supp'd with the Prince of  Conde  his FatherinLaw and his whole Family after which a great many Tears were shed as if they should never see him again Perhaps they knew that he could not set that Crown upon his Head without coming to the Point of the Sword and consequently that he had many Dangers to go through And in earnest that consideration is more than sufficient to alarm those who are concern'd for a Person so that if Tears be allowable upon any occasion they are upon this The Princess of  Conti  appear'd to be less mov'd than the rest or at least if she shed any Tears they were not so bitter as they might have been Though there was no body that was so nearly concern'd for the Prince as her self yet she thought it her Duty to behave her self so as to seem worthy of the great Fortune to which she aspir'd Not that she did not love the Prince very tenderly but besides this her Ambition and the Desire of being a Queen that had so great a place in her Soul she was not ill pleas d to see the Prince go from Court She knew too well that he was amorous to a foolish degree and fed her self with the hopes that the removal  of his Mistriss from his Eyes would unhinge his Affection for her  The Prince rid Post to  Dunkirk  his Equipage being sent before with all possible Expedition The Coffer which contain'd the Pistols that the King gave him happen'd to be broke underneath and the Purse in which they were being turn'd upside down a great many of 'em were dropp'd about two are three Leagues from  Paris  By chance 'twas upon a Marketday that they were lost and the  Gonnesse  Bakers having found 'em no sooner understood whose they were than they deliver'd 'em up for one of the Prince's Pages had come back to know if any body had found 'em 'Tis alledg'd that the Prince had purposely left or Pistols out of the Bag and put them in that sorry Coffer in order to leave with those that found 'em an eternal Memorial of his Departure from  France  'Tis true he is likely enough to do such a thing for he's as generous a Prince as any about the Court And for that reason 'twas said of him that if he shew'd himself to be of the House of  Conde  by his Bravery he would not do it by his Generosity He took nothing to himself and 'twas such a Prince as he that the  Poles  wanted in order to sink the Memory of the Avarice of their late King or rather to make 'em sensible how advantageous his earlier Arrival at the Throne had been to them for he would never have sold a Palatinate or any other Place his Humour was too much a stranger to the sordid Measures of their late King or at least if ever he should take up with them he must needs be very much alter'd  Bart  had prepar d every thing for putting to Sea and scarce allow'd the Prince a few hours Sleep till he weigh'd Anchor with a fair Wind He pass'd by his Enemies without being perceiv'd and steer'd on his Course without any Opposition for they knew nothing of his passing till 'twas too late to pursue him  All the Northern Princes were mightily concern'd about the Transactions in  Poland  for all of 'em had Affairs to adjust with that Crown However the King of  Denmark  did not act up to the Measures of the rest who earnestly desir'd that the Duke of  Saxony  should be preferr'd to this Prince for he would never grant Audience to a Minister that the Duke sent to sollicit him to hinder the Prince to enter the  Baltick  He put him off with trifling Amusements till the Prince had past the  Sundt  and then gave Audience to the Envoy after which he waited with Patience and Tranquillity till God should decide an Affair of that consequence as he pleas'd Some indeed alledge that he offer'd underhand some Ships to the Prince of  Conti  and that the Prince only thank'd him for his good will because he thought he had no occasion for 'em and that the Success of his Expedition depended rather upon the Affection and good Will of the  Poles  than upon any Succours he could receive from any other hand but the King his Master After all the Prince arriv'd before  Dantzick  being incourag'd to hope that the Inhabitants of that City would open their Gates to him This City was to him as 'twere the Key of  Poland  especially if he should be oblig'd to dispute his Title to that Crown upon the point of the Sword 'Twas by that place only that he could expect Succours from  France  since these could not come otherwise than by Sea But instead of answering his Expectation the Citizens sent Deputies to intreat him not to come ashoar in their Territories by reason that in the present State of Affairs they could not declare either for him or the Duke of  Saxony  without exposing themselves to great hazards The Prince of  Conti  did not construe their Words literally but as he ought to have done He presently perceiv'd that their Words insinuated all the Enmity to him that could be and that they had only disguis'd their real Sentiments for fear of  displeasing the King whose Power they were too well acquainted with to draw it upon their own Heads At the same time some  French  Merchants that were settled there came on Board his Ship to offer him their Service in what their Power could reach and assur'd him that his Sentiments of the Matter were very just Nay they gave him to know that the City had enter'd into a strict Alliance with the Duke of  Saxony  by the Mediation of the Elector of  Brandenburg  who had set it on foot as soon as he receiv'd Advice of his Election That if they might freely disclose their Thoughts to him they would not advise him to go ashoar any where without a strong  French  Army to guard his Person That they knew not what Reports might have been spread abroad to perswade his Highness to come so far but they were afraid he would only have the trouble of returning without effecting any thing That the  Poles  who were formerly Friends to the  French  began to take up the same Passion against them that other Nations had That the Glory of the King had struck them with fear as well as the others That they were made to believe that the King aspir'd to an Universal Monarchy and that the fear of becoming his Subjects scar'd them from preferring a Prince of his Blood to their Throne  Though these Merchants had not given this Account to the Prince he had quickly found it out himself Instead of that croud of new Subjects that the Cardinal Primate had made him to expect before his Departure from  France  there came scarce any one to visit him on Board most of those that came were only mov  d so to do by their Curiosity so that excepting a very small number that offer'd to pay him the usual Honours of Soveraignty and treated him as King there was no body that did any thing like it But he would never suffer either these or his own Retinue to do it for fear  his Reign should be shortliv'd He gave them to know that he was not so overfond of a Crown as to purchase it at the Expence of his Honour that he only came thither in compliance with the Cardinal Primate's Request to Succour their Nation which as he alledg'd the Duke of  Saxony  mean'd to oppress by a boundless Ambition that the Cardinal had promis'd to draw together an Army out of hand to inable him to satisfy his desire that when he should have done what he pretended to in serving them he would not then declin  he Title of their Defender but as for that of King he would never accept of it till things were upon another foot than what they were at that time and indeed they could not be upon a worse foot than they were with Reference to him The Duke of  Saxony  after his being proclaim'd King by his own Party had not only possess'd himself of the City and Castle of  Cracow  but likewise of that of  Warsaw  where the Kings of  Poland  us'd to Reside He had got himself Crown'd in one of these two places partly by Force and partly by good Will while the Cardinal Primate protested equally against his Coronation and his Election  The Prince of  Conti  finding that the Duke was thus Master of the Heart of the Country and that  Dantzick  was but too partial to him us'd all his Efforts to gain the Governor of  Mariembourg  a place that was not far distant from the place where he was Could he have master'd that and been succour'd by his Party he would have made it a place of Arms The Governor of that place made as if he listen'd to his Proposal in order to make him speak  French  but the Prince being not in a Humour to do it without seeing further into Affairs gave him only conditional Promises upon which the Governor who had not yet made up Matters with the Duke of  Saxony  endeavour'd to do it tho' without acquainting him that he did it because he  could have no Security from his Rival The Generals of the Army of the Crown and that of  Lithuania  came likewise to feel the Prince of  Conti  's Pulse and to try if they could finger his Bills of Exchange They had hitherto pretended to entertain a Correspondence with the Abbot of  Polignac  upon the magnificent Promises he had made 'em That Ambassador thought he might promise any thing so as to secure this Crown without observing that he had to do with People as cunning as himself and even engag'd underhand to the Duke of  Saxony  from whom they expected to draw more considerable Sums than from him The Prince of  Conti  had no mind to bid so high as the Ambassador because lying is not the Character of a Prince as it is of those Ministers who commonly think the direct contrary of what they speak Accordingly he reply'd that he was oblig'd to them for the tender of their Service but if they pretended to be paid beforehand he willingly dispens'd with it that he was ready to bargain with them about what he should give 'em provided they made his Election good but if they mean'd only to take his Money and afterwards to excuse themselves upon the Plea of the impossibility of making good their promises he would chuse rather to keep his Money than expose himself to future Repentance for giving it away to no purpose These Generals or rather their Deputies hearing him speak in this fashion perceiv'd quickly that he was too longheaded for them and having drop'd all designs of pulling a Feather from him did underhand advise the Duke of  Saxony  to endeavour by all possible means to seize upon his Person To bring this about instead of declaring openly for the Duke they made their Address to the Cardinal Primate as if they had been troubled to quit an Interest that they were joyn'd to by Inclination The Cardinal suffer'd himself to be amus'd for some time by glittering Hopes and  even fed the Prince with them He endeavour'd to persuade him that he would speedily send him an Army capable to reduce the Duke of  Saxony  which should oblige the Prince to wait the Execution of his Promises notwithstanding the Inconveniencies he strugled with upon the Sea  This Affair was so long in dependance that the Peace after dwindling for some Months was concluded before it came to be determin'd The Princes of the Empire were forc'd to submit to the pleasure of stronger Powers The  French  recognis'd the Prince of  Orange  as King of  England  and that Prince coming then to the  Hague  the Plenipotentiaries of  France  began to pay him the Honour and Respect that was due to the Dignity they had acknowledg'd to be his However it happen'd that Monsieur  Harlai  being accustom'd to call him by another Name than that of King us'd his wonted Expression in a Conference where he was present but being at the same time sensible of his fault he made the best Reparation he could Madam  Harlai  the Chancellor's Daughter having gone to meet her Husband in  Holland  and having the Curiosity to see that Prince whom all the  French  have a particular Esteem for notwithstanding the harm he has done 'em This Lady  I say  imploy'd some body to desire Audience of him in some place or other The New King would not give it her at his own Apartments but sent her word to be at the Princess of  Vaudemont  's at a certain hour Madam  Harlai  had all the reason in the World to be satisfied with his Civility and Courtesy As for Monsieur  Harlai  he to act the part of a good Courtier acquainted my Lord  Albemarle  his  British  Majesty's new Favourite who began then to have as great an Ascendant in the King's Affection as ever my Lord  Portland  had He acquainted him  I say  That he desir'd his Master's Picture My Lord  Albemarle  promis'd to give it him but withal intreated him to have patience  for some time because his Master was upon his Return to  England  and he was afraid he could not spare the time to let it be drawn Whether that Lord forgot his Promise or whether the King of  Britain  was so taken up with Affairs of Consequence that my Lord could not have the opportunity of making good his Promise whatever was in it four or five Months pass'd and Monsieur  Harlai  had resolv'd not to think of it farther when he receiv'd Information at  Paris  that my Lord's Trumpeter staid in his Hall to speak with him At first he could not conjecture what should bring him so far from home for he was far from thinking that his Master should have call'd to mind his Request after letting so much time slip without sending to him But after all he found that his Errand was to bring him the Picture My Lord had caus'd a magnificent Frame to be made for it at  Paris  because that sort of Work is better done there than in  England  The Trumpeter took care to let him know so much to shew what Pains his Master took to content him Monsieur  Harlai  thought this an odd way of conveying a Picture but Foreigners have their peculiar Customs as we have ours and so he was e  en oblig'd to take the Complement together with the Charges He gave the Trumpeter a handsome Present and that being all that this Messenger wanted he return'd forthwith to his own Country  Of all the King's Plenipotentiaries at  Ryswick  Monsieur  Harlai  as 'tis alledg'd bore the least Figure as to Sense but he bore the greatest on another score I mean his Quality and the first places of the Robe which for a long time have been fill'd by his Ancestors Upon this account he had had the whole or at least the greatest part of the Honour of the Treaty if the People had found any thing in it to their advantage But 'twas so far from that that all Persons regreted secretly and even publickly  all the Restitutions that the King oblig'd himself to in that Treaty as much as if they had been to part with their own Estates It must be own'd that this fancy was in some measure foolish for besides that his Majesty knew a great deal better than they what was convenient for him and his Kingdom according to all the measures of good Sense they ought to have desir'd nothing more than an end of the War in order to prevent their being expos'd to the Evils they must of necessity undergo as long as it should continue But as People do not always act conformably to Reason so they made with Reluctancy the very Fireworks that they were commanded to make pursuant to the usual Custom upon all such Occasions Insomuch that the Commissaries of the Wards were oblig'd to back their Injunctions with the Penalty of a large Fine and without that they would never have agreed to it However even that did not scare 'em from censuring all that had been concluded upon To this purpose they handed about a pretty pleasant Story which shew  d how little they were satisfied with Monsieur  Harlai  That Magistrate had a Son that was as Foppish as his Father was Grave for in earnest the Father resembled the two Courtiers of whom Monsieur  de la Feuillade  said That when his Majesty had a mind to drink his Liquor cool his Cupbearers needed only to cool the Bottles by placing 'em between these two This Son  I say  was so far from resembling his Father that he had always acted up to the Character I here give him He was at  Ryswick  when the Affairs of that Negotiation were brought to a Conclusion but neither the Solemnity of the place nor his Father's Character could make him wiser than usually However Monsieur  Harlai  having sent him to the King with the News of the signing of the Treaty he stay  d so long by the way that the News were known at Court thirty Hours before  his Arrival This slowness did not become a young Man especially one of so much Fire who us'd always to walk like Lightning Upon which account the World was amus'd with it but at last they began to say That they ought not to think it strange since for certain the Father was confounded with the Son that it was the Son that had made the Treaty as appear'd from his Impatience in signing it notwithstanding the prejudice it did to the King and the State and that 'twas the Father who brought the News to Court which was equally manifest from the tediousness he shew'd upon the Road for fear of wounding his Gravity The principal foundation of this Raillery was that the  Spaniards  were so mortify'd by the taking of  Barcelona  that they sought for a Peace at any rate and that whatever Proposal the  French  Plenipotentiaries should have made after an Action of that importance the  Spaniards  would have agreed to it and consented that the King should retain  Luxemburg  as an equivalent for that place if the Plenipotentiaries had been so wise as to take the advantage of the Consternation they were in  Though the People by this Conduct seem'd to controul the King's Actions yet his Majesty was not ill pleas'd to find 'em of that mind For as it was a Mark of their Folly so it shew'd their concern for his Majesty's Interest Whatever was in it they scarce had the sense to observe that neither Monsieur  Harlai  nor any of his Collegues had done any thing without the King's Orders But we must not pretend that that sort of Cattle are ever govern'd by Reason Capricio and Humour is the ordinary Standard and Rule of their Thoughts In effect those who but two Months before cry'd out for a Peace with all the Passion imaginable had no sooner got it but they wish'd the War had continued Their Reason was this Instead of lessening the Prices of things which had been very dear for  some time by reason of the preceeding bad Seasons they saw the Markets still rising besides that the Wrath of God was seen in the Barrenness of the Earth we may attribute this Affliction to another Cause occasion'd by the War The King had been oblig'd to Recoin the Money twice that it might serve instead of an Edict Indeed he had got considerably by this Project for he rais'd the  Louisd'ors  to  Livres  and the  Silver Crowns  to  Livres    Sous  though the one was not commonly worth above  Livres  and the other three▪ Now the King for some Politick Considerations keeping up the Denomination of the Money it came to pass that what they us'd to have at easy Rates from Foreign Countries prov'd very dear by reason of the loss of the Exchange which was a full sixth part  The Prince of  Conti  did not trouble his Head with these matters He thought upon nothing but either seeing the effect of the Cardinal Primate's Promises or returning to see his Mistress His Eminence had retir'd to the Castle of  Cowits  where his Partisans assembled several times to no purpose Many of 'em complained that Abbot  Polignac  had fed 'em with the hopes of things that were not like to be put in Execution He had gone so far as to promise that they should not want either the Money or the Troops of  France  for that being the only Affair that he minded he wish'd that the King in like manner might have nothing else to mind The Duke of  Saxony  finding that they began to complain of that Minister caus  d a Body of  German  Troops to enter the Country This put those who were most expos'd into a Consternation and some of 'em making some advances towards the making of their Peace with the Duke the Prince no sooner receiv'd the News but he resolv'd to return to  France  but at the same time to make the City of  Dantzick  repent of their giving his Rival the Preference  he order'd  Bart  to seize some of their Ships that lay just by him They had anchor'd in the Road with a design to sail up to the Port with their Cargoes but  Bart  obliging them to follow him carry'd 'em to  Copenhagen  where the Prince was forc'd to put in by stress of Weather At the same time the King stopp'd all the  Dantzick  Ships in his Harbors which makes it probable that the Prince of  Conti  's Orders to  Bart  did not come so much from himself as from the King The Prince who had been very uneasy in his Voyage was more so when he came to  Copenhagen  notwithstanding that the King of  Denmark  shew'd a particular Esteem for his Person He set a part a great number of Houses for the Prince and his Retinue and the Wind continuing contrary for some Days that little time seem'd so long to that Prince that I doubt if the six Years that according to the  English  Historians one of their Kings spent in  Ireland  before he could find a favourable minute to return to  London  I doubt  I say  Whether these six Years were longer to that King than those few Days were to the Prince The occasion of his uneasiness was that he was still in Love and that all the Comfort he had was to wait for the Postdays that he might hear from the Party he lov'd  The  Dantzickers  made what Reprisals they could they arrested the  French  Merchants at  Dantzick  and seiz'd their Effects But after all they knew very well that 'twas not proper for them to Quarrel with a King that the greatest part of the Forces of  Europe  had in vain attempted to bring down and upon that view they had recourse to the King of  Denmark  's Mediation to procure the releasing of their Ships The King made 'em stay some time before he granted their Request but at last believing that the Mortification he had given 'em was sufficient to make 'em remember it he accommodated the matter  to their Satisfaction Abbot  Polignac  was astonish'd at the Prince's Return and the Conduct of a great many who after siding with his Party began to Desert him At the same time notice was given to him from the Duke of  Saxony  that he ought to retire with Expedition out of the Country or if he did not that he could not answer for the Security of his Person The Abbot did not think it his Duty to wait for a second Message but set out  incognito  without any Retinue and order'd his Equipage to make towards the Sea in order to Imbarque there as well as himself but they were robb'd before they could reach the Ships that stay'd for 'em The Abbot did not know whether the Court which had given him no Orders for his Retreat would be pleas'd with it and therefore he stay'd some time at  Hamburg  to know the Orders of the Court He wrote to the Marquiss of  Torcy  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs but receiv'd no Answer and having complain'd of this to his Friends in that Country their Answer was not very satisfactory They told him That the Court was very Angry with him and that the Cardinal Prima  e did not cease to do him disservices In earnest his Eminence wrote a great many things to  France  to his prejudice he even insinuated that he had applied to his own use part of the Money sent him on the Prince of  Conti  's behalf 'Tis believ'd that this Accusation was false and that 'twas only the Cardinal's chagrin upon seeing himself abandon'd that made him speak in that fashion 'Tis true the Abbot was Poor and that some time before he was reduc'd to such Straits that his Family would have wanted the Necessaries of Life if he had not found Friends to assist him The Cardinal who knew his Straits and likewise knew that some time after he had paid his Debts' probably grounded his Charge upon that Circumstance But let it be as it will though a Man be never so Innocent 'tis a  great Misfortune to lie under an Accusation The Court sent him Orders to retire to an Abby he had in  Normandy  whether it was that they credited the Accusation or which is more likely that they mean'd to make him answerable for the event  The Duke of  Saxony  having thus unhing'd his Competitor thought he wanted nothing to compleat his good Fortune but the Pope's Favour As soon as he was proclaim'd King he had sent an Envoy to sollicite his Holiness to favour his Interest But as that Court moves but slowly especially when there's any thing of Religion in the case so his Holiness would not grant Audience to the Envoy till he was fully assur'd that that Duke had abjur'd  Lutheranism  A Certificate of the Abjuration was brought to him but he suspected it mightily It came only from the Hands of a Bishop of his Family who might be suspected to be gain'd by that Prince because their common Grandeur was concern'd upon that occasion The Duke having never entertain'd any Correspondence with that Court was not throughly vers'd in their Politicks and was so far from seeing through the true Spring of his Holiness's Motions that he imagin'd the Pope to be in the Prince of  Conti  's Interest Accordingly as soon as the Prince return'd to  France  he sent a second Envoy to the Pope to represent to his Holiness that he needed not to continue any longer in the Interest of a Prince who by his Retreat had given sufficient evidence that he had drop'd his Pretensions to the Crown In the mean time the Pope was far from being biass'd that way Had he been oblig'd to side with one or t'other he had not scrupl'd to fall in with the Duke He was an  Italian i e  no great Friend to  Frenchmen  besides he was by Birth a Subject of the King of  Spain  which Quality did not allow him to depart from the Sentiments of the House of  Austria  However being Head of the Catholick Church and upon that score oblig'd to observe Measures on all hands he sent Orders to his Nuncio at  Cologn  to go for that Country He order'd him under the pretence of promoting the Interest of Religion to reconcile the Cardinal Primate and the Duke The Cardinal shew'd all along a violent Resolution to raise a Civil War rather than be without Satisfaction for the Affront offer'd him by the Bishop of  Cujavia  by Crowning the Duke He alledg'd and justly indeed That the right of Coronation was lodg'd in the Church of  Gnesne  of which he was Archbishop The Pope had another Nuncio already upon the spot who of his own head did not fail to anticipate the Orders given to this For he knew very well that whatever he did for the Interest of the House of  Austria  would be approv'd by his Holiness and accordingly had privately embarqu'd in the Duke's Party  Some time being spent in all these Transactions the Year came to an end which was the time alloted by his Majesty for the Conclusion of the Marriage of the Duke of  Burgundy  to the Princess of  Savoy  Every day he lik'd the Proposal better and better and the young Princess had such a winning way that he lov'd her as tenderly as if she had been his own Daughter The Duke was but weak for one of his Age insomuch that though the Ceremony was to be perform'd out of hand yet he was not to enjoy her till he pass'd Years and she In former times when the Marquiss of  Louvois  marry'd his eldest Daughter to the Duke of  Rocheguyon  the Son of the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  the Consummation of the Marriage was not put so long off but the Relations on both sides made a mutual Compact that the newmarried Couple should not see one another but once a Week namely on  Thursdays  and that they should live in Celibacy  without any mutual Commerce for the rest of the Week This made 'em always long for the arrival of the appointed Day of meeting and inspir'd 'em with a mutual Eagerness And if all marry'd Persons were confin'd to the s  me measures perhaps they would not be so soon weary of one another as we commonly find 'em However the King having regulated the matter as above Preparations were made for celebrating the Marriage which were expensive to an unparallel'd degree Nay his Majesty intimated that he would take it well if every body would act up to his Abi  ity in honouring the Festival 'Twas not the literal performance of this desire that would have satisfied his Majesty if that had only been requir'd the Nuptial Ceremonies would have been a very mean thing for the charge of the War and of the Taxes that still continued during its whole course had so impoverish'd the Subjects that they could scarce be poorer than they were So that all the Courtiers and even the Military Officers that happen'd to be then at Court put another Construction upon the matter They knew where the Kings meaning lay and all of 'em being ready to do any thing to please his Majesty straiten'd themselves to obtain that end The charge they were at was altogether extraordinary nay some of 'em bought Cloaths that were worth more Money than the intrinsick Value of their Estates I do not speak by way of Amplificacation but deliver a naked Truth witness a great many Land and SeaOfficers who laid out or Crowns for one Suit of Cloaths though at the same time a great part of 'em were not worth Crowrs a Year of Patrimonial Estate Herein lies the Folly of the  French  and though I am a  Frenchman  my self and perhaps as great a Fool as others yet I cannot abstain from censuring our common Folly  After the Conclusion of the Peace there was so great a Confluence of Foreigners at  Paris  that in the  Suburbs  of S  Germains  only there was about or  This Multitude made the Lodgings so excessive dear in that place that the Houses which were lett at  Livres  during the War were rais'd now to  Crowns In a short time the numbe  of these Foreigners increas'd to above one half insomuch that in a little time after or about the beginning of the succeeding Year they were computed to in that very  Suburbs  And as they had been inform'd that during the War  France  had not only been exhausted of Men but also of Treasure this being a Report spread abroad on purpose to amuse them and make them believe that  France  would be very glad to Truckle to the Will of her Enemies they were extreamly surpris'd to find at their Arrival every thing in a different Disposition to what they were made believe while at home They saw that great Town did not only abound in People as much as ever but that Luxury and Pleasu  e were arriv'd to such a degree in it that the meanest Citizen was more splendid than the Persons o  Quality in their Country In effect the greater the Mise  ies were in private Families the more they endeavour  d to blind the World with sumptuous Appearances However these Measures serv'd only to augment 'em besides it must be own'd that the most part of the Women us'd this Luxury at the expence o  their Honour Few or none of them but had her Gallant and none of these Gallants was esteem  d but in proportion to what he lavish  d upon hi  Mist  ess As the War had rais  d a vast number of People who apply  d themselves to business by which they gam'd a great deal of Money so having c  me very easily by it they as freely lavish'd it A great many who had formerly been glad to have got Shoes to their bare Feet did now bestow Coaches on their Misses Insomuch that in or  Years time the number of Coaches was increas'd to above Gold and Azure were to be seen in every Family which extreamly surpris'd these Strangers who before their Arrival had heard that all  Paris  could not afford either SilverSpoon or Fork and that the King had pillag'd them of all to support the Expences of the War It's certain that the War had impoverish'd a great many but such were to be seen rather in the Country than in  Paris  On the contrary  Paris  had never been either so Rich or so Magnificent there being Millions expended in it only by the Parties that were form'd there since the War without reckoning what others might have gain'd by a thousand different ways For while some got infinitely by the Partisans in lending them Money upon extravagant Interest others applied themselves to the way of Victualling or to some other thing so that it might be justly alledg'd as War had ruin'd some it had rais'd others so prodigiously that they were no more to be known for the same Persons So different were they now from what they had been formerly There was such an infinite number of Sharpers and such like Scoundrels who had rais'd themselves from the very  Scum  of the People to vast Riches by sucking the Blood of the poor People This was reckon'd so good a Trade that even some Marquisses apply'd themselves to it Thus you might have seen one embrace this Trade without regarding what was said either of his own Relations or his Wifes who was either Granddaughter or Sister to a  High President  As for himself there was one of his Name a  Lieutenant General  in the King's Army but as there is a difference betwixt Relations the  Lieutenant General  behav'd like a Man of Quality and Merit while he acted like a wretched Miscreant or at least like one who thought it no Crime to dishonour his  Name  and  Family  If the Strangers abovemention'd were amaz'd to find every thing at  Paris  so different from the Relation they had of 'em at home they were much more astonish'd to see the Solemnity of the Marriage of the Duke of  Burgundy  and the Princess at  Versailles  The Ceremony was perform'd with all the Splendor imaginable they gave a great many  Balls  where all the Persons of Quality retaining to the Court of both Sexes were present All the Ladies were cloath'd in Black Velvet set out with precious Stones that cast the brightest Lustre imaginable The Men were also adorn'd with Diamonds As on such Occasions the Pickpockets of  Paris  are very intentive upon their Business so they came in whole Swarms to keep Holyday at  Versailles  adorn'd as others were and abating for their Countenances that are hardly well known in that place one would have thought they were all Persons of the first Rank The extraordinary Crowd as one may easily imagine afforded them sufficient opportunity to make up with considerable advantage the Expence of their Ornaments A great many after their return home found at their leasure that the Diamonds they had carried to the Solemnity were gone The Rogues had taken from some  one  from others  two  and so more or less and they might repute themselves happy who came off free Even the Duchess of  Burgundy  did not escape the common Fate of those who had suffer'd by these Pickpockets They ventur'd to cut away a part of her Gown where she had a large Buckle of Diamonds But what is surprizing the  Chevalier  of  Sully  had the same fate and what he lost was by the hand of a Person of the first Quality He catch'd him in the fact and took the liberty to tell it to one of his Friends His  Majesty  overheard it and desir'd to be further inform'd of the matter but was extreamly astonish'd when they whisper'd to him the Name of this young Pickpocket he forbid to Challenge him upon it being willing to save his Honour for the Respect  he had for his Relations however his Charity serv'd to no purpose for not only all the Court knew the Secret but also all  Paris  Upon the Marriageday the new married Couple were put to Bed but the Curtains being undrawn there were a great many Witnesses of their Actions only in order to see if they lay close to one another The King to give them a sufficient opportunity caus'd draw the Curtains while the Duke of  Beauvilliers  and the other Officers of the young Prince stood just by to overhear what might pass but nothing having pass'd they soon undrew the Curtains That young Princess kept Assemblies the same day and the following days Her Court was very throng and the Ladies strove who should shew her most Respect There happen'd a difference betwixt the Princess of  Har  ourt  and the young Duchess of  Sully  Daughter to the Duke of  Coaislin  She was Niece to the Duchess's  Lude  Lady of Honour to the Princess This Relation came by her Husband who was the Duchess or Brother's Son she wanted her Assistance in regard of her Youth not being in Condition to enter the Lists with a Princess whose only business had been since she was in the World to ingratiate her self with all in Power from the highest to the lowest Minister But instead of the Assistance she expected from her the Aunt advis'd her to yield to her Adversary All the Duchesses were highly incensed against the Duchess of  Lude  finding she had tarnish'd their Honour by so scandalous an Advice In effect though such sort of Disputes had often fallen out not only betwixt the Princesses and the Duchesses but even betwixt their Husbands yet perhaps such another as this had never fallen out before The Dukes and Duchesses had always maintain'd their Rank as if St  Louis  had begot them The late Duke of  Montauzier  and the late Duchess of  N  lles  stretch'd the Affair yet further the one against Monsieur  Le  Grand  a Prince of the House of  Lorrain  and the other against the Duchess of  Bouillon  Though the Duchess of  Noailles  was only the Daughter of a  Farmer  of the Revenues yet she was sensible that in  France Nobility  came not by the  Wives  but by the  Husbands  she shelter'd her self from any Indignity by the Character of her Husband whom she took to be beyond Reproach However it ordinarily falls out in a Difference betwixt two Parties that they upbraid one another even to the five hundreth Generation The Duchess of  Bouillon  produc'd Records by which she made it appear that  Anthony  of  Noailles  had been formerly Master of the Houshold to one of her Husband's Ancestors In fine this Affair enrag'd the Parties to that degree that they call'd one another all the  Ill Names  they could think on His  Majesty  was at last oblig'd to impose Silence by his Authority he forbad them expresly to proceed farther without deciding any thing in the matter that caus'd their heats I do not know if the Duchess of  Lude  was afraid of these  Ill Names  in doing what she had done or if she thought because the King had given the Preference to the Dukes before the Princes of the House of  Lorrain  the last time he made a Promotion of Knights of the Order that therefore it ought to be the same in regard of the Women but it pass'd after the manner I have told you  Though the Peace had been made a pretty while yet none hitherto reap'd the Fruits of it The Commerce was as dead as in the time of War whether it was attributed to the high value of the  French  Coin that continued still at the same Rate or that the King believ'd he could subsist without other Nations while others must have recourse to him there was yet no advance made to make it flourish In the mean time there came some Ships from  England  and  Holland  to take in Wine and Paper at  Bourdeaux  and  Rouen  They bought along  other Merchandize to be sold there But the  Tariff  not being yet regulated between all the Parties and the Treaty of  Ryswick  having only mention'd that it should be put upon the same foot as it was in the Years and which was not yet done this together with the loss of twenty in the hundred by the Money oblig'd these Ships to return without either selling or buying any thing in these Ports About the same time the  StatesGeneral  sent  Deputies  to the King to demand the Execution of that Article They apply'd themselves to the Marquiss of  Torcy  Secretary for Foreign Affairs but Monsieur  Ponchartrain  having the Charge of that Commerce they were remitted to him for the Execution of their Demands These  Deputies  were exceedingly well vers'd in Affairs of that nature and the States having an intire Confidence in them had given them a  Full Power  to Act as Commissaries in the Regulation of the  Tariff  Monsieur  Pontchartrain  heard them upon the Matter but being Judicious and Politick he put them off with fair Words until he had acquainted the King with the Affair The Commerce of  Holland  was of far less advantage to  France  than  that  of  England  because they draw a great deal more Money from the one than from the other In effect the  Hollanders  Import more Merchandize into  France  than they Export whereas  England  on the contrary Exports more than they Import So that the first carries out the Coin and the other brings it  in  This made them resolve to keep up the  Tariff  as high as possible in regard of the  Holland  Trade its Imposts or Customs while they design'd to lower it in regard of the  English  while they expected the  Hollanders  should come to  Paris  to terminate that Affair they resolv'd to send to  London  to regulate what regarded that Nation  Ponchartrain  pitch'd upon Monsieur  Phelipe  ux D'Herbeaut  his Relation for that purpose he was first Commissary of the Marine  under Monsieur  de Maurepas  who had left him the whole Managment of it He had the Character of  CommissaryGeneral  for regulating the Commerce betwixt the two Nations but though his Commission was presently dispatch'd yet he stay'd a long time after In the mean time the Court nam'd other Commissaries to treat with the  Hollanders  but as they had no design to terminate the Affair to their Satisfaction so it continues to this day at the same pass  While these matters were a transacting the King nam'd  Ambassadors  to go to all the  Foreign Courts  and instead of sending Gentlemen of the  Law  as had been always practic'd in  France  he employ'd Persons of Quality or Officers of the Army He thought if they could joyn the Knowledge of the Cabinet to the Experience they had acquir'd in warlike Affairs they would be more accomplish'd for his Service upon all occasions He chose the Marquiss of  Villars  LieutenantGeneral of the Army for the Court of  Vienna  and the Marquiss of  Harcourt  also a LieutenantGeneral for his  Ambassador  to  Spain  who during the War had acquir'd a Reputation equal to any and could he perform the same thing in his Embassy which he had done at the Head of a Flying Army no more could be expected of him but that being a hard Task his Friends could hardly hope for it He was going to a Court where the very name of  French  is suspected much more at a time when he seem'd very earnest to create all the Obstacles imaginable to the Emperor's Designs of bringing the Succession of his Catholick Majesty to fall upon the King of the  Romans  his eldest Son or that failing upon the  ArchDuke  his second Son  Philip  IV his present Majesty's Father had left it by  Testament  to the last tho' he was not Born at that time but the  Spaniards  shewing no Inclination to execute it his  Imperi  l Majesty  labour'd to engage them to favour the King of the  Romans  He thought that being his eldest Son he not only deserv'd better that Dignity which was much more solid than that of Emperor though not altogether so splendid but he expected also to secure the Fortune of his Son the better if he could unite these two Qualities in one Person The Queen of  Spain  being his Sisterinlaw he did not doubt of her favouring his Design and the Count of  Harrach  his  Ambassador  at that Court had a Commission to propose it to her The  Queen  join'd Issue with the Ambassador in all his Sentiments and his Imperial Majesty being hitherto so prosperous in his Designs as to get the  Queen  's Creatures into his Catholick  Majesty  's Council and she being very industrious to gain the other Members they met often to consider how to behave in the Scene they were to Act The Count of  Harrach  insinuated to the Queen and them that the best Method they could fall upon in this Juncture was to put the Government of the Frontiers into  German  hands or into the Hands of Persons wellaffected to the Emperor The Prince of  Darmstadt  who signaliz'd himself in the Defence of  Barcelona  was propos'd to be ViceRoy of  Catalonia Don Francisco de Velasco  having rendred himself unworthy of that Command by suffering himself to be surpriz'd in his Camp The Government of  Milan  seem'd too good to escape one of his  Imperial Majesty  's Creatures as did also the ViceRoyalty of  Navarre  for the Count of  Harrach  suppos'd very reasonably that it was by attacking of one of these three places if not all the three at once that the King of  France  meant to make good his Pretensions to the  Spanish  Succession immediately after the Death of that Monarch The  Queen  and those of the King's Council who were in her Interest found it difficult to manage that point for though the  Spaniards  were too wise to own their Sentiments openly yet they had not the least Inclination to own either the Emperor's eldest or youngest Son  for their Soveraign They were also of the same Opinion in regard of the  Dauphin  and his Sons though some of the  French  Emissaries endeavour'd to insinuate to them secretly that if they would chuse either the Duke of  Anjou  or the Duke of  Berry  they could form their tender Years according to their own Model insomuch that it would be impossible for them to perceive they had ever been born  Frenchmen  And by these means they labour'd to extirpate the Antipathy that was natural to the two Nations but that being a hard Point to manage they always rejected it with scorn They could never conceive why they would deprive the Prince of  Bavaria  of that Succession for it was naturally his  Right  after the Renunciation his Most Christian  Majesty  had made of it when he married the  Infanta  of  Spain  Others wish'd since the King had no Heirs begot of his own Body the Crown might fall to some  Grandee  of  Spain  They believ'd they should be more happy under such a Person than under any  Foreign Prince  For such a one being train'd up from his Cradle in their  Customs  and  Manners  they could bear more easily with him than with any other For generally all Men inherit the  Genius  of the Country where they are Born and it is hard for them ever to change their natural Inclination  Such was the Disposition of the Affairs of that Nation when the Queen of  Spain  made use of all her Interest to have the Prince of  Darmstadt  made ViceRoy of  Catalonia  Prince  Vaudemont  Governor of  Milan  and Prince  Eugene  of  Savoy  ViceRoy of  Navarre  For she not only look'd upon them as wellaffected to the Emperor but also very capable to defend against the  French  the Places committed to their care They had distinguish'd themselves upon a thousand occasions and Prince  Eugene  was actually employ'd against the  Turks  with whom the Emperor was in continual War That Barbarous  Nation ow'd its Preservation only to the Diversion was made upon the  Rhine  when his  Imperial Majesty  was engag'd against  France  But now the Peace being concluded betwixt these two Potentates the Emperor thought of no less than swallowing up the  Turks  in a Campaign or two at most and dislodging 'em of all their Possessions in  Europe  But whether that Prince meant to take his ease after so tedious a War or what is more likely that true Policy oblig'd him to desire a Peace there were already some Proposals made that had a favourable hearing from both Parties and perhaps without that Prince  Eugene  who about this time saw himself at the Head of the Emperor's Army would hardly accept of the  Office  of ViceRoy of  Navarre  But now finding himself oblig'd to put up the Sword he was glad that by the  Emperor  's Influence the Queen of  Spain  had that  Deference  for him However her success in that was not so favourable as it was on the behalf of the Princes of  Darmstadt  and  Vaud  mont  For the Services of the first at  Barcelona  pleading highly in his Favour she carried it for him without any Opposition but she met with more difficulty in regard of the Government of  Milan  Some would have it continued to the Marquiss of  Leganez  who was there already or conferr'd upon some  Grandee  of  Spain  but that was far from the  Queen  's mind she meant rather to strip them of what they possess'd than provide them with new Governments The Duke of  Medina Celi  one of the most considerable Grandees of  Spain  and most belov'd of the People was ViceRoy of  Naples  He had pass'd some years in that Employ and places of that nature are usually triennial in  Spain  yet she would gladly have it conferr'd upon one of her Creatures but her Friends thought it not convenient and rather advis'd her to the contrary to continue it to him and gave for their reason that she ought to be very  cautious in bringing him to  Spain  in the present Posture of Affairs which would not fail to awake the People's Affection for him and consequently to make some Obstacles to the Emperor's Designs  The Reasons which oblig'd the  Emperor  to strike up a Peace with the  Port  were these His Power became formidable not only to the Princes of the Empire but even to his other Allies Besides knowing his Pretensions to the Succession of  Spain  they not only oppos'd it privately but even avowedly The Princes who granted him Succors against the  Turks  spoke of withdrawing them The New King of  England  before he was own'd by  France  offer'd his Mediation for agreeing the Parties He had sent two  Ambassadors  to the  Port  on purpose to propose it to the  Grand Seignior  but they both died upon their way thither This appearing very extraordinary because the  Sultan  's Interest seem'd altogether opposite to his Conduct and besides the Death of these two Persons affording matter of Speculation upon a great many things some believ'd assuredly they had been poyson'd This might have discourag'd his  Britannick Majesty  from sending any more Ambassadors into that Country but considering that the  Turks  their rejecting of the Peace was only grounded upon the Diversion was made in their favour and that possibly they would lay aside their Obstinacy when convinc'd of their Error he assum'd his first Resolution nor was he in the least deceiv'd for the  Grand Seignior  accepted of his offer now with as much warmth as he had rejected it before with indifference He accepted of  his Mediation  and the  StatesGeneral  's which was offer'd to him at the same time And being satisfied that in the Peace they had made with  France  they had easily surmounted all the Difficulties that commonly attend the Preliminaries of  Treaties  they mean'd to follow the same Method in  this  The Emperor understanding that the  Turks  had accepted of the Mediation that was offer'd 'em gave notice of it to the  Potentates  who were interested with him in the War namely the  Republicks  of  Venice  and  Poland  and the Great Duke of  Muscovy  They were mutually ingag'd in an  Offensive  and  Defensive  League so he being resolv'd to do nothing without their Consent desir'd them to give in their Pretensions in  Writing  while the Parties should have condescended upon the place of assembling For his own part he put in his which he did not expect would be granted because the Jealousy the  Mediators  as well as other Princes had of his Power oblig'd him to make an end of these Differences He pretended that the  Turks  by the  Teeaty  that was on foot ought to be oblig'd to give him up  Belgrade  and  Temeswaer  with all the  Right  of Soveraignty that he possess'd in  Transilvania  At the bottom these People thought themselves very happy that the Emperor would consent to a Peace upon so reasonable Terms but however Barbarous they are they are truly Politick and no sooner perceiv'd that the Mediators as well as they were glad to oblige him to lay down his Arms but they refus'd to consent to these Terms  The  Republicks  of  Venice  and  Poland  and the Great Duke of  Mus  vy  fearing that Prince would have made the Peace without them sent Ministers to  Vienna  to pry into the Affairs there The  Czar  sent thither his own  General  while himself resolv'd to pass into  Holland  and  England  to establish a more solid Commerce in these Countries than had hitherto been done He look'd upon himself as one of the most powerful Princes of  Christendom  in regard of the vast extent of his Dominions but being ignorant how to improve so great a  Power  to the best advantage he was little more esteem'd than the Prince of  Courland  He no sooner thought of  his Resolution then he put it in Execution He took his Road through the Marquiss of  Brandenburg  's Dominions who receiv'd him with all the Respect due to his Person from thence having pass'd into  Holland  he continued there some time applying himself diligently to the knowledge of their Commerce and Policy In effect seeing their  State  much more flourishing than could have been thought in proportion to their Extent he easily conceiv'd it was only owing to their Prudence and Conduct and being thereby the more induc'd to imitate them he entred into a new  Treaty  of Commerce with them and bought some Ships of them Afterwards he pass'd into  England  and having acquainted the King that he had Affairs to propose to him his  Majesty  appointed Commissioners to hear them  While the New King triumph'd after this manner either upon the account of the advantageous Peace he gave to  Europe  or the great Confidence his Allies had in him or the Consideration they had for him insomuch that nothing could be enterpriz'd without his Approbation the Pope's Nuncio whom he had sent into  Poland  after he had conferr'd with the  Ordinary Nuncio  at that Court and been inform'd by him of the State of Affairs in that Country signify'd to his  Polish Majesty  that his  Holiness  was not so averse to his Election as he supposed that the main thing in question was whether his Conversion had been sincere and provided that Point was clear'd the  Holy Father  would be fully satisfied God alone was capable to know it there being none besides who can search hearts However in all outward appearance this Prince would have the World convinc'd he was a good Catholick At least he perform'd all the Duties of a true Catholick and omitted nothing to confirm the People in the belief of his Sincerity The  Nuncio  being sensible of what considerable Advantage the  Pope  's Consent would be to him for gaining to him these Persons that continued still in his Enemy's Party upon a suspicion that his Conversion was only feigned and being apprehensive that as soon as he were peaceably establish'd on his Throne he would return to his Vomit  I say  The  Nuncio  who understood how necessary his  Holiness  was to him like a cunning Politician mean'd to make the best use of this opportunity and therefore before he would assure him altogether of the Apostolick Favour he represented to him that it was impossible for him to perswade all  Europe  of the Sincerity of his Conversion any other way than by testifying as a new Convert the profound Respect he had for his  Holiness  that since all who profess'd that Religion owed an intire Obedience in Holy Matters to the Apostolick See he wish'd his Majesty would not only renounce certain Privileges that the Kings of  Poland  pretended to as their Right but also dismiss all the  Lutheran  Ministers that followed him without using that pretext for retaining them that he had a great many of that Religion along with him He also proposed many other things of the like nature a plain evidence that the Court of  Rome  never neglects any Advantage they can catch Upon these Conditions he offer'd to imploy all his Interest with the Cardinal Regent to pacify the Commotions of the Kingdom putting him in hopes that the Respect he had for the Person who sent him would oblige the Cardinal to accept of the Terms he design  d to propose to him  The King of  Poland  being sensible how capable the Cardinal's Party was to annoy him besides that new Commotions were arising in  Lithuania  which was all up in Arms to support two Parties that made War against one another to wit Prince  Sapieha  General of the Troops of that Duchy and the Sieur  Oginski  Great Ensign of it a Dignity  of a distinguishing Importance in that Country  I say  The King of  Poland  being afraid that this Quarrel which seem'd to proceed from Jealousy was only a pretence to reverse his Election promis'd to the  Nuncio  all he desir'd However he desir'd to be excus'd from signing any thing touching the Privileges he would have him to renounce until he were better inform'd in what they consisted and had the Advice of the Republick without whose Approbation he could not handsomely conclude any matter of that importance The  Nuncio  could not well disapprove of this Objection that appear'd so reasonable He went to  Lowits  to confer with the Cardinal Primate whom he found so enrag'd against his  Polish Majesty  for protecting so avowedly the Bishop of  Cujavia  his mortal Enemy that he almost despair'd of ever succeeding in an Affair he had promis'd so confidently to bring about But as the  Italians  are cunning Politicians qualify'd with a deal of Patience he gain'd by degrees upon his Eminence's Passion He gave him to know that the Prince could not have acted other ways than he had done hitherto for as much as that Bishop had been all along the Soul of his Party that he agreed with him in thinking that he had reason to resent the Actions of that Prelate who had incroach'd upon his Privileges that after all he ought to consider that it was not in his Power to hinder what was done nor so much as revenge it by force that his Party who fell off daily was in no Capacity to enterprize any thing against his Enemy who was supported by his  Polish Majesty  and his Troops that  France  by whose means he had hoped to triumph over him never pretended to concern themselves any further in the Quarrel having formerly declared so much to his  Holiness  by their  Ambassador  so he would find himself certainly mistaken if he  aid any  stress  upon them  The  Cardinal Primate  was much surpriz'd to hear the Nuncio speak after that manner not questioning in the least the truth of this Declaration he sent immediately one of his Creatures to his  Most Christian Majesty  to assure him that his Party was not yet reduc'd so very low but they were in a condition to foil their Enemies if his  Majesty  would give them a very small Assistance The Prince of  Conti  who was no more in the humour to return to that Country and indeed never was when left to his choice gave his  Majesty  so very bad an Impression of the sordid Avarice of the  Poles  that he was little less than enrag'd at the Arrival of this new Envoy He thought the  Cardinal Primate  ask'd him Succours only to make his own Terms the better So he sent back his Envoy with Letters signifying what he had already declared to the  Pope  namely That he would concern himself no more in the matter His Eminence was too happy in making use of the Cardinal Nuncio to interceed for him with his  Polish Majesty  There was a Treaty made between the Parties by which the  Cardinal Primate  promis'd on his own behalf and in behalf of his Party to own that Prince for their Soveraign The King of  Poland  for his part promis'd to give him some Satisfaction upon the Bishop of  Cujavia  's Account By this  Treaty  there was also an Authentick Provision made for the Injury done to the  Cardinal Primate  's Dignity by the boldness of that  Prelate  in Proclaiming and Crowning the King after his Election It was also agreed upon by this  Treaty  That the Nation should never lay down their Arms until they had oblig'd the  Turks  to restore  Caminieck  and  Podolia  For it was alledg'd That if the late King of  Poland  had been cordial in the War against the  Turks  he might have recover'd it but he who had sav'd  Christendom  by the seasonable Succours he brought to  Vienna  which had he only delay'd three Days longer all had been lost without Remedy became so lazy in  what concern'd the  Republick  that one would have thought he had lost his Senses However by this  Treaty  they oblig'd the new King to carry on the  Siege  at his own Expences and upon these Conditions they condescended he should keep his Troops in the Country though formerly they murmur'd extreamly for that these Troops had enter'd the Kingdom contrary to their Laws and Customs And even from that Subject took occasion to exclaim highly against him as if he had entred the Nation by force and mean'd to secure it by Conquest rather than by lawful means  After the Conclusion of this Treaty the Cardinal Primate went from  Lowits  to pay his Homage to the King at  Warsaw  His  Majesty  sent the principal Gentlemen of his Court to meet him and honour his  Entry  which had much more the  Air  of a  Triumph  than what was due to the merit of a  Criminal  He was accompanied into the Palace by a great many Persons of Quality who were overjoy'd to see this Reconciliation The King and he had a private Interview for half an hour It was generally believ'd that the Troubles of the Kingdom were now at an end and in effect the Queen of  Poland  having lost all hopes of seeing her Son upon the  Throne  which till that time she never despair'd of ask'd his  Majesty  's Leave to pass some time at  Rome  The King refus'd it before he advis'd with his Council which was compos'd of the principal Senators of the  Nation  However they saw no inconveniency in granting it and gave her to know that she should not be hindred to depart when she thought fit Accordingly she put her self in a readiness to be gone against the latter end of the Year Every Person applauded that Princess's Conduct for after all she had done to hinder the  Election  of his Majesty as well as of the Prince of  Conti  she could hardly remain in the Kingdom with any satisfaction nor could she handsomely pass into  France  where it was impossible for his Most Christian Majesty to see her without Indignation yet it was generally believ'd she would chuse  France  for her Retreat it being natural for People to love the place of their Nativity For it was openly reported That she was treating with the Duchess of  Portsmouth  and her Son the Duke of  Richmond  for the Duchy of  Aubigny  in  Berry  which the late King  Charles  II bought for that Duchess upon certain Conditions not very acceptable to her But the King being sensible that if he did not tie her up to such Terms a Woman of her Temper might be reduc'd to end her Days in an Hospital was therefore glad to do her this kindness against her Inclination He had already a Mistris of the same Temper namely the Duchess of  Cleaveland  who had lavish'd away all that the King had given her However he bestow'd large Sums upon the Duchess of  Portsmouth  and such was his Liberality that he had laid out above a Million of Money for  China  to her But though there be nothing harder than the Substance 'tis made of she found out a way to melt it all at  Paris  without suffering any other inconvenience by it than what ordinarily attends  Misery  However it was not altogether impossible to accommodate the Difference betwixt the Queen of  Poland  and his  Most Christian Majesty  if her  P  lish Majesty  would condescend in some measure to imitate the Count of  Bi  lk  mention'd before She might have own'd her self in the wrong and supplicated his  Majesty  for the Honour of his Protection but she was too haughty to condescend to it insomuch that she was now wholly intent upon leaving speedily a place where her Circumstances had suffer'd so sensible an Alteration For during her Husband's lifetime every one was glad to truckle to her in regard of the Ascendant they knew she had over him Now the Scene was  chang'd and so different from the former that every one was ready to impute to her what was blam'd in her Husband as if she had been the only Person who prompted him  The King of  Poland  being thus own'd by the  Pope  and wanting only now to be recogniz'd by his Most Christian Majesty in order to enjoy peaceably the Dignity of a Crown that had been so much disputed sent a Person of Quality to  France  to excuse the Robbery committed upon the Abbot of  P  lignac  's Equipage and to establish a good Correspondence with his  Majesty  for though in appearance he had no need of him especially being so strictly join'd in Alliance with the Emperor and all the Princes his Neighbours yet considering that Kings have long Arms especially the King who governs  France  at this time he would omit nothing that was due to Policy The King receiv'd his  Envoy  with all the marks of Respect he could wish for and all Parties forgeting the occasion of their Differences a good Intelligence and Union was establish'd betwixt the two Nations though hardly to that degree it had been formerly In the mean time the King return'd to the Prince of  Conti  the Money he had expended in the pursute of that Crown which in all probability pleas'd him much more than if he had obtain  d  it  Not that he is Covetous in any degree but continuing still Amorous the satisfaction he enjoy'd in seeing his  Mistriss  rendred him insensible of all other pleasures Besides he was soon comforted for the loss of that Dignity by the liberal share he had with the Duke of  Vendome  in the  Dauphin  's Favour and the hopes he had of gaining his Process before the Court of Parliament as he had done formerly  However there happen'd an Accident to the Duke that was like to deprive him both of that Advantage and his Life In his return from  An  t  a House which King  Henry  IV had given to the  Lady  Jane Gabriell  of whom he was descended He was like to be drown'd in a PostChaise for he was up to his Chin in a little River which he was oblig'd to pass and it being the middle of Winter the Cold which he suffer'd was capable to do him all the mischief that could be expected from so cruel an Accident But as he is a Noble Prince who delights to do good and has no Enemies and besides had acquir'd a great deal of Glory before  Barcelona  so every one was overjoy'd to see their Fears end more happily than they expected It only cost him a  fright  however this General who by his Conquest had gain'd the Reputation of the greatest  Hero  being subject to a great many Infirmities as well as the  Ancient Hero  's found himself so bad that he was oblig'd to apply himself to Physicians He had contracted a Disease that gave him more trouble than the taking of four  Barcelona  's And his trouble was so much the greater that his Malady was of an old standing and created him every moment insufferable Pains he enjoy'd no manner of rest and it was to be fear'd that if he neglected it any longer it might be pass'd all cure He resolv'd to put himself into the hands of a Chymist Physician nam'd  Chambon  This Gentleman was nothing different from those of his Kidney that is to say neither better nor worse than a Quack who boast as highly as if they were many degrees above  Aesculapius  but if he cured four Persons he certainly kill'd a whole Dozen and the Cures he had perform'd were rather the Product of  Chance  than of  Skill  He was much at one with Dr  Carette  who had but one Remedy for all manner of Diseases and yet would have Mankind believe that he was the ablest  Physician  in the Universe Be it as it will this new Physician set himself up in form because he had cured some few Persons in the World and amongst others a certain Abbot of  Chaulieu  who was a sort of Intendant  of the House of  Vendome  This Abbot was very desirous that the Duke would make use of  Chambon  to cure him However the Duke withdrew in a short while and had no great reason to brag of his Physician's Remedies For  Chambon  did nothing and at this time the Duke finds himself in little better Circumstances than when he first made use of him It may be rather said That he is still worse for the more inveterate these Diseases are they are the more difficult to be cur'd Yet some will have it that his Grandfather found the means to be cur'd after Forty Years but that was scarce done by the Skill of a Chymist and its probable that if his Grandson had copied him he had apply'd himself to some other Person than his Intendant's Favourite  The Duke of  Savoy  had no reason to complain of his Daughter's Marriage but knowing that the King had no mind to have it consummated he intreated his  Majesty  to consummate it to the end his Daughter's Condition might be more secure He was afraid that the Duke of  Burgundy  might come to die by some mischance and so his Daughter be return'd upon his hand But that was far from his Majesty's Inclination on the contrary it was well known if that had happen'd he would have married her to the Duke of  Anjou  and in view of that only he hindred all Commerce betwixt them to the end that a Dispensation might be the more easily obtain'd I can't tell whether the King made his Design known to him but it is certain that after the Marquiss of  Ferrette  had spoke to him by his Majesty's Command the Duke was not only out of all hopes but shew'd no Inclination to it However if he could not obtain that Demand he succeeded in a short time after much better in another he made to his  Majesty  He intreated him to Banish Madamoselle  de Soissons  whose Conduct was offensive to him out of his Kingdom He also  desir'd of him to cause shut up Madamoiselle  de Carignan  in a Convent The last shew'd a great deal of Complaisance to a married Man who lived after a very indifferent manner with his own Wife whether it was that he had inherited that of his Father who had never been a good Husband or that the Affection he had for this Princess made him peevish at the sight of all others It was much suspected that the King himself was the principal Author of these Demands to the end that these two Persons might no more be seen at Court nor in  Paris  Though they had the Honour to be so nearly related to the Duchess of  Burgundy  yet their Behaviour was altogether unworthy of their great Quality for besides their Conduct that was not very regular they were both in extream Necessity and so far from being in Circumstances to support a Rank suitable to their Birth that they had hardly wherewith to maintain sufficiently the Condition of very ordinary Persons besides the King was fain to supply them by his Royal Bounty without which they had often wanted the very Necessaries of Life The eldest was sent to  Brussels  to keep Company with her Mother who resided there the other was shut up amongst the  Carmelites  in the  Suburbs  of St  James  with express Order to the  Superior  of the Convent that she should be permitted to speak to none but certain Ladies whose Names were transmitted to him in Writing Madamoiselle  de Carignan  might have easily avoided this Indignity if she had had a mind she had been warn'd of it a long time before and the King himself sent her word that if she meant to please him she would take a Maid of Honour of his Recommendation At that time he offered her Apartments at  Versailles  with sufficient Maintainance for that Lady of Honour but she excus'd her self under pretence that she had one already and that she could not handsomely accept of another without exposing the first  However sincere she might have been in her Excuse yet in a thing capable of a double entendre People are more ready to take them in an ill Sense every body believed that her Excuse proceeded only from the great desire she had to continue her Intrigue But the King having put an end to it after the manner above related her Gallant was to look for his Comfort where he could find it  In all appearance he could not be so easily comforted whether he thought that his Honour was concern'd or that he was  really  afflicted as he would have the World believe he display'd his Wrath more than ever against his Wife and though she was reputed a Lady of intire Virtue yet as it was generally believ'd he us'd often to lay hands upon her But till that time she conceal'd very industriously what just Reason she had to exclaim against his Conduct but after that and several other Outrages it was no more in her Power to dissemble her just Resentment of them She complain'd of them to all her Relations that they might the more readily approve of her Intention to commence a  Process of Separation of Bodies  against him for she had been of a long time  separated  in  Goods  without which she and her two Children had been reduc'd to the greatest  Indigence  In effect this Man's Conduct was so mean that he went often not only without one Penny of Money but without Cloaths and Hat No body could disapprove of her design which she put in Execution a few days after and her Husband who had retir'd from her some days before told his Wife's Friends that it was altogether needless for her to plead for a Separation from him since for a long time he desir'd no better and would allow the  Sentence  to pass whenever she thought convenient But there being many more People who delight in Debauchery than in vertuous  Living  this Gentleman was  nevertheless acceptable in certain Companies even Princes countenanc'd him as they had usually done and being one day at the Duke of  Chartres  's Table there was by chance some  Sauce  dropp'd by one of the Attendants upon his Cloaths and however Plain and Coarse these Cloaths were he was extreamly vex'd at the Accident no wonder for he had got no other in his Wardrobe for a change This he told the young Prince betwixt Jest and Vexation The Prince seem'd not to regard it but talking with the Company said  That ordinarily Misfortunes attended them who were least able to support them  He intreated two or three Persons of Quality who were there to go keep him Company the next day  For in all appearance  said he  you'll find him in Bed while he sends his Cloaths to the Scourers and at least that will be some Comfort to him  This poor Husband was actually oblig'd to do what the Duke said but the next day the young Prince sent him four Suits made by his own Taylor to the end that if any such misfortune befel him another time it should never hinder him to appear as usually  About that time the King caus'd to Arrest one of the Ushers of his Chamber one of the most visionary Companions in the Universe whom notwithstanding his  Majesty  allow'd to Discourse with very often in regard he durst not let his Folly appear before the King which he had not the wit to conceal in other Company He had of a long time thought to cause Hang all the Seamen from the Marshal  D'Estree  and  Tourville  to the very meanest He pretended they were all Rogues upon certain Memoirs which a Commissary of the Marines who was broke had given him He had importun'd his Majesty a thousand times upon it and represented to him that if he would examine the Abuses which had crept into the several Employments of these Officers he might find a fair opportunity  of raising justly a Tax upon them to the tune of Sixty Millions It was about the middle of the War when he spoke after this manner to the  King  they had a deal of difficulty to raise Money and therefore his  Majesty  thought the Advice was not to be despis'd and supposing there might be somewhat in it he sent him to Monsieur  Pontchartrain  But that highly displeas'd this Extravagant Gentleman who probably had a mind to regulate this Affair himself with his Majesty or perhaps design'd to involve that  Minister  in these pretended Malversations for a Fool is capable of any Extravagancy However he was oblig'd to obey the  King  there was hardly a Person to be found who thought himself more able and fit for business than this Fool But Monsieur  Pontchartrain  being as Prudent as he was rash knew presently how little ground this  Numskul  had for what he advanc'd He acquainted the King with it His  Majesty  was much of the same Opinion yet this Man who had the opportunity to speak to his Majesty whenever he pleas'd could not be perswaded of his Error but still presented new Memorials to him by which he intreated him to appoint some other Commissioners to hear him who might have more leasure to examine the matter than Monsieur  Pontchartrain  offering upon pain of Death to make out what he advanc'd to be as clear as Daylight This  Confidence  of his together with some secret  Springs  he set at work made the King resolve to give him a  Hearing  He obtain'd also some  Acts of Council  by which he pretended to give a light to some obscure Affairs From that time forward this rash  Numskul  never saw any of the Officers of the Marine enter into the King's Chamber but he told to such as were by him that these Gentlemen were to be tax'd in immense Sums one in two Millions some in more some in less and he though  t himself already one of the  first  Peers  of the  Kingdom  because he had ask'd of his  Majesty  a share of what was to be recover'd of these Gentlemen by the Tax and the  King  had granted it to him but himself had promis'd a share of it to such as were capable to ingratiate him with his  Majesty  This must needs have been very disagreeable to the Person concern'd However this little Gentleman forgot himself more and more daily even to that degree of Impudence as to vaunt that notwithstanding all what Monsieur  Pontchartrain  was able to do he did not doubt in the least to succeed in his Enterprize In fine That  Minister  being no longer able to bear with his Extravagancies made it his business to represent them to the King He had slighted them long before as well as the Person who was guilty of them He thought him only unworthy to be regarded but every one told him That his Interest was concern'd more than he was aware of in making his  Majesty  acquainted with the truth of the Affair for he having the whole Power of the SeaAffairs it seem'd as if he accus'd him underhand of conniving at these pretended Abuses that he suffer'd in others So he was at last prevail'd upon by these Reasons and therefore made known to the King that this Man was only an extravagant mad Fool fitter to be sent to  Bedlam  than countenanc'd by so great a King that his Impudence or rather his Madness appear'd too evidently in daring to accuse two  Marshals  of  France  together with the whole Body of the SeaOfficers without any regard to so many Persons amongst them equally considerable for their Services and distinguished by their Quality and very incapable of doing any thing against their Duty who came daily to him to demand Justice of that Fool for his Insolence and intreated him earnestly to represent it to his Majesty He added that he hop'd that his Majesty would cause to examine once for all the Accusations of that unaccountable  Fool to the end he might be confounded when it should be made manifest that the Accusation was rather visionary than real  The King having heard this  Minister  very attentively promis'd to do all he demanded without loosing any time Accordingly he commanded the Commissioners whom he had ordain'd to examine that Affair to search narrowly into it The Commissioners apply'd themselves presently to it and having discover'd that all what he advanc'd was in effect nothing else but the Imagination of his empty Brain they gave his  Majesty  a full account of it The King immediately forbid that Man ever to trouble him any more with that Affair but he not being wise enough to take the advantage of this Advice would still insist as formerly and had almost said that all of them had conspir'd to save the guilty The King told him a second time that he commanded him absolutely never to speak to him of that Affair though he was so good as to conceal what he had reason to believe of him This Man thought at last his best way was to dissemble and obey his  Majesty  in appearance But while he seem'd to be silent he left no Stone unturn'd to return to his former Trade He brought over the Knight of  Lorrain  to his side in order to engage the Duke of  Orleans  in the Affair and tho' such eternal  Protens  's as this Knight are little to be credited yet he made use of his Interest with that Prince to succeed in his design The  Duke  spoke of it to his  Majesty  who was exceedingly surprized that this little Gentleman dar'd to fall upon these Methods after he had expresly forbid him He told freely his Sentiments of it to the Duke and forbid him ever to concern himself with such Affairs From that time the King resolv'd to get rid of him though it is always against his Inclination when he falls upon such extream Measures with any who had the Honour to be his Domestick  for no Prince ever shew'd greater kindness to his Servants However he suspended his Resolution until he saw that it was impossible to make him Prudent This little Gentleman being severely check'd by the Knight of  Lorrain  because he brought him into bad terms with the Duke of  Orleans  was still so Impudent as to put up a Petition in the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  's Name without ever acquainting him with it beforehand It's true he had been twice at the  Duke  's Lodgings after he had done it without having the opportunity of meeting with him He hop'd that the  Duke  who was in very good Terms with his  Majesty  would regard his Visions as real Truths and espouse his Interest as his own This Petition was presented to his  Majesty  before the  Duke  had time to return home and the King made mention of it to the Duke He made him also the same Compliment he had made formerly to his Brother the Duke of  Orleans  to wit that he would not take it kindly if he harken'd to that impertinent Fool or ever spoke of his Affairs to him The Duke extreamly surpriz'd at this Check which he had by no means deserv'd because the Petition had been given in without his knowledge protested to the King that he was ignorant of what he meant and was so far from excusing his Fault that he desir'd Justice for what he had done The King promis'd to give him full Satisfaction and resolv'd now more than ever to get rid of such a dangerous and medling Fool However as if this  Numskul  had not already done enough towards his own Ruin he wrote a Letter in which he complain'd that the  King  himself oppos'd the Service he intended to do him This Letter was intercepted and brought to his  Majesty  He found it too Insolent to confine his Punishment only to a Banishment from his Presence He caus'd him to be sent to the  Bastile  where he was commanded in the King's Name to lay down his Charge He shifted  the matter for a while but in the end it being insinuated to him that he must expect to continue Prisoner there for life if he would not comply he chus'd to do the last  The SeaOfficers were not the only Persons who were accus'd unjustly There came about that time a certain Abbot of Quality from a Foreign Country of whom they took the liberty to say no better things For they accus'd him of having desir'd to speak with King  William  before the Peace was sign'd and to perswade him that he ought not to think of making a Peace with  France  for that  France  could not fail to be absolutely destroy'd if the War was continued two Years longer His Family being one of the most considerable of all  Britain  was extreamly afflicted when they heard him talk'd of after that manner especially his eldest Brother who was in the Service and pretty well advanc'd He durst not shew himself any more to the  King  fearing his  Majesty  would make him answerable for the Crime alledg  d against his Brother Nevertheless his Majesty after the Example of the  Almighty  had long before explain'd himself upon that Head saying in presence of all the Court  That every one should bear his own Crime and that Relations were not to be answerable for the Iniquities of their Relations  And in effect one of the  Musqueteers  having committed a horrid Murder in the Year His  Majesty  knew no sooner that his Brother who was a Captain of Horse was so extreamly afflicted at it that he design'd to make his escape into the  LowCountries  than he advanc'd him in the LifeGuards He could give no more evident Proof to all the World that he never meant to make one answerable for another's Crime However this  Abbot  's Brother being a Man of singular Honour though he was sensible of the  King  's Justice yet he could not avoid g  ieving extreamly at it and what added much to his Grief was that he distrusted his Brother altogether He  knew very well that his little Band never hindred him from doing many things which reflected mightily upon that Habit He had occasion'd a Divorce betwixt a Husband and a Wife He carried on an amorous Intrigue with a President's Wife which occasion'd great wrangling betwixt them nor had the Husband stopt his Resentment there if his Relations and Friends had not convinc'd him that a great many Chances attend our Lives which it were better to conceal than declare These things he partly believ'd but it was not in his Power to hinder himself from Murmuring which did the  Abbot  a great deal of injury who both by his Quality and his Brother's Service pretended to have already a good  Abbey  but now saw himself a thousand Miles distant from it The King who desires that every one should mind his Duty that is to say that a Soldier be a Man of Courage that a Judge be Just and a Churchman Honest and Pious no sooner knew that he made it his practice to Debauch other Men's Wives instead of confirming them in Virtue than he absolutely forbid Father  de la Chaise  who had put him down in his PocketBook in order to have a good Benefice ever to propose him any more as a Subject worthy of any Dignity  The poor  Abbot  who had more  Quality  than  Riches  was extreamly vext to see his hopes so frustrated by his own faults However knowing that there was Mercy for all Sins he put himself into a  Seminary  Whether he truly repented of what he had done or would make the World believe he did so by these means he meant to free his  Majesty  of the bad Impression he might have of his Conduct and insinuate himself into his Favour The King who is a very Judicious Prince and is seldom or never mistaken in his Opinion of Persons did not allow himself to be impos'd upon by that Change so very different from his former Life For he Preach'd  Fasted and Catechiz'd and in a word there was not one Churchman not only in the  Seminaries  but even within twenty Leagues round it whose Conduct was more Exemplary than his Father  de la Chaise  was very desirous to oblige him but could never comprehend whence arose the  King  's Aversion for him being naturally good and more inclin'd to judge well than ill of any Person he took occasion to speak to his  Majesty  of him and represented to him that the Austerity of his Life and his regular Conduct did not only deserve an  Abbey  but even a  Bishoprick  that the greatest Sinners become ordinarily the greatest Saints and if  God Almighty  were like him they must blot out of the Calendar a great many Saints who after having committed very great Crimes had shew'd the Abbot the way he follow'd at present The King was nothing mov'd at his Confessor's Discourse On the contrary he answer'd him that he might blot him out of the List of Bishops as he had done a while ago out of the List of Abbots for he never would honour him with that Dignity  I do not know if ever this Answer was made known to the Abbot or if he was already weary of passing his Days in a  Seminary  and waiting so long time for a Benefice of which he saw no appearance whatever was the matter he chang'd his  Residence  very soon It's true it did not renew his Intrigue with the  President  's Wife or with any other On the contrary he avoided all for a long time as if he meant to continue the Life that he made so great a shew of in the Eyes of all  France  But whether he saw that they would eye him narrowly or that he intended to continue his Course he pass'd into  Flanders  where he apply'd himself to Catechizing every day He also began to assist dying Persons and the Marquiss of  Blanch  ford  second Son to the Duke of  Crequi  falling Sick about that time it was he that exhorted him to prepare  himself for the Passage that appears so terrible especially to those of such a youthful Age as he was of Father  de la Chaise  took occasion upon this also to speak to the  King  in favour of this  Abbot  He told him that the Abbot did not require his Presence to oblige him to good Actions and so he could not be reproach'd as a great many others might justly be with Hypocrisy But the King nothing mov'd by this new Attack answer'd  That he could never perswade him but that the Abbot was no good Man that time would discover very soon which of them was most deceived but he did not believe it was himself  Father  de la Chaise  reply'd  That he was afraid his Majesty offended  God Almighty  in judging so badly of his Neighbour  But his Majesty return'd it smartly home in saying  That he was afraid that he offended him more in desiring him to give a Bishoprick to a Man whom he thought altogether unworthy of it  I know not whether this Answer came to the Abbot's Ears but all of a sudden he left the great desire he had shown while in  Flanders  to Catechize Men and without acquainting any Person with his design went into  Holland  to caress the Women there at least he was seen doing it soon after his arrival However his going often to the House of one of the Plenipotentiaries gave occasion to some People to say  That this  Preacher  was not only debauch'd but also a very dangerous M  n  In a word he was suspected to have given not only Memoirs to that Ambassador but also to have had a private Interview with King  William  and reveal'd to him a great many Secrets However all that was false nor had he any other design to go so often to that Ambassador's than to pay his Respects to a Person who fill'd the President's Lady's Room in his Heart She was also somewhat more deserving than the other without doing her any injustice However as one Lye general  y begets a great many amongst those who vent them the next Day all  Paris  would have it  that the King had wrote to King  William  to entreat him to send him the  Abbot  bound Hand and Foot they made it also known to the pretended Criminal by a Letter unsign'd and the Handwriting was altogether unknown to him but advised him if it came seasonably to his Hand he would make it his Business to save himself by flying to  Turky  rather than suffer himself to be taken  The poor Abbot was much astonished at this Accusation if they had accus'd him of being Amorous he had been oblig'd to own it because it was true Neither the  Seminary  where he had been nor the Mortifications which  Pere de la Chaise  had advanc'd so much in his Favour to the  King  were capable to wean him from that unhappy Passion to which to his great Misfortune he was very subject In fine knowing himself not only Innocent but also uncapable of the crime laid to his Charge he went to wait upon Monsieur  Harlai  in order to ask him if he had receiv'd the  Order  of which they had given him Advice secretly if so he came to put himself into his Hands so that it would not be necessary to Arrest him and if it was sent to any other Person he came however to deliver himself Prisoner to him that they might not be at the trouble to search for him he intreated him to acquaint the King with it that his  Majesty  might be satisfied of his Innocence until he could make it evident before any Commissioners his Majesty should be pleas'd to appoint Monsieur  Harlai  had heard somewhat of the Matter before This oblig'd him to examine his Conduct and to set some Spies upon him in order to watch whither he went at some certain hours for he judg'd that it must needs be about that time that he was most busied about his Treason if Fame was to be believ'd but at last these Spies reported to Monsieur  Harlai  that he was altogether took up about his  Mistriss  which justified him so  much in his Opinion that he gave him to know he wish'd with all his heart the Prison he was engag'd in might not prove more troublesome to him than what he came to look for at his House that it would not prove very hard for him to break his Chains because he not only declar'd him free but also Innocent of what was laid to his Charge as far as consisted with his Power However he believ'd that his Heart was not so much upon the  French  as it had formerly been but as it's impossible to be always in Love he was perswaded it might return to its former Inclination when he thought least of it and by these means he might be at ease for he would secure him none would impute to him this as a great Crime In effect this was the Abbot's Crime And though he was shelter'd in it from all he was threaten'd with nevertheless he was not so happy as to continue always in the good Esteem of Father  de la Chaise  He durst not speak any more in his Favour to his  Majesty  considering he had set up a  Holland  Lady in the place of the President's His  Majesty  ask'd also that good Father if he was now convinc'd and if he intended still to demand a Bishoprick for that Abbot The Jesuit was somewhat humbled at that Reproach and all he could say for his Justification was that he could not hinder himself from being impos'd upon by the Tricks of an Hypocrite no more than any body else  But if his  Majesty  was proof against the Recommendations of his Father Confessor whose Opinion in Matters of that Nature gains generally the  King  's Consent the Case was quite different with regard to another  Abbot  whom this good Father protected also I mean the  Abbot  of  Coadlet  whose sad Adventure has no Parallel in any Ancient or Modern History nor perhaps ever will have in those to come Not but that they afford us Examples  enough of depos'd Bishops but as that is seldom done but by the Authority of the Church or upon the account of manifest Heresy or for some other Capital Crime If I be not mistaken I may confidently say  that the History I mean to insert here exceeds what can be said of these Examples  But be it as it will the Abbot of  Coadlet  a Gentleman of  Britany  though he had already a Dignity in the  Chapter  of  Vannes  yet he thought it not amiss to ask some other little Benefice by which means he might subsist the more conveniently and confin'd the utmost extent of his Ambition to the having four or five thousand  Livres  a Year And to that end by the means of very good Friends apply'd himself to Father  de la Chaise  upon whom he believ'd all these Matters depended This good Father told him  That he did himself an injustice in restricting himself to so narrow Bounds and that he ought to ask some better thing for he could hope to obtain it  The Abbot was overjoy'd to hear him speak after that manner and as generally a good Appetite increases by eating so this Gentleman of a little Abbot was now very desirous to become a fat Bishop However he durst not mention it suddenly to  Pere de la Chaise  but the good Father gave him to know that the Dignity he enjoy'd already in the Cathedral render'd him worthy of the other especially when it was joyn'd to all the other Qualities requisite for a Bishop so he got himself to be listed in the Catalogue of the Candidates for the  Episcopal Dignity  However he continued at  Paris  until the King had fill'd up some vacant Bishopricks which had Pretenders enough For now the Scene is alter'd from what it was formerly amongst those upon whom they conferr'd that Dignity who said ingenuously  Nolo Episcopari  I will not be a Bishop For nowadays they think at least if they do not say  Volo Episcopari    i  e I will be a Bishop and no doubt they think it from their very Heart because it is  impossible to give an account of all the Friends they employ or of all the Springs they set at Work in order to obtain the  Mitre  The Abbot of  Coadlet  who knew pretty well the Secret how to come by it was not sufficiently satisfied to hear only Father  de la Chaise  for him tho' he was the best Friend he could employ but he apply'd himself to others also who were capable to do him as considerable Service as the former For he thought as in legal Processes abundance of the Law breaks not the Law so in offers of this nature he could never make use of too many on his behalf However as there are many who Ruin themselves in making use of the Methods that others save themselves by so he found that what he took to be of greatest advantage prov'd most destructive and that to such a degree that it's impossible for him ever to retrieve it Being inform'd That in the Age we live in Women are as serviceable as any thing else he made his Address with his utmost Application to Marshal  Crequi  's Lady who was his Countrywoman That Lady promis'd him her Favour and was as good as her Word But he having likewise heard that old Women have not so much Interest as young ones quickly abandon'd her and took up with her Daughterinlaw whom he took to be more capable to serve him He waited upon her punctually every day and in the Holyweek he happening to be at her House had not the power to refuse to accept of a match at  Ombre  that she propos'd to him some say it was  Bassette  but either of 'em is equally criminal before God unless it be that the one is a greater Instrument of Passion than the other However he consider'd that 'twas not a proper Imployment for one that pretended to a Bishoprick especially at such an unseasonable time and for that reason he carefully requested the Lady and all her Company that the Doors might be kept  very close lest any body should see him ingag'd in an Exercise so inconsistent with his Profession 'Tis such a common thing at  Paris  to see the Gentlemen with the little Band playing at all sorts of Game that the very Footmen who overheard his Discourse look'd upon him as a Hypocrite but they were strangers to his Pretensions and consider'd very little of what consequence it was to him to have it conceal'd from the  King  nor how necessary it was for him to have it kept secret least it might blow up his design  However that Week having pass'd before the King heard any thing of these Transactions he filled up the vacant  Benefices  according to his usual Custom upon  Easterday  for he never names any body but at that time whether it be because it's a Formality of a long standing or that the King's Confessors have introduc'd it in order to have themselves courted the more during the Interval but passing over that as a thing I have no mind to search into we must believe that this  Abbot  was only known to the King upon the account of his Brother who was  Lieuterant  of the  Guards  however seeing him first in the List of the  Candidates  for  Bishopricks  he ask'd his  Father Confessor  who this Man was The  Good Father  meaning to do him a kindness had no mind to say any thing to his disadvantage but extoll'd him to the Heavens for the best of Men insomuch that his  Majesty  believing him one of the best Men and of the most exemplary Life in his  Kingdom  nam'd him for the  Bishoprick  of  Poictiers  This news was no sooner known at  Paris  than every body was amaz'd for his name was never heard of out of his own  Prov  nce  before though by what happn'd to him in a short time after it was in every one's Mouth Every body who heard he was to have that  Bishoprick  believ'd he must be a Person of extraordinary  Virtue in regard the King had chosen him to so good a  Benefice  to the prejudice of a great many considerable Persons who expected it But those who had play'd with him at the Marchioness of  Crequi  's made no Secret to tell others that he was not so wonderfully  Godly  for he had employ'd one day in the  Holy Week  at  Game  This News came the same Day to the King's Ears which made his  Majesty  pass that Night in a mortal Anxiety fearing that  God Almighty  would call him to an Account for having  nam'd  a Person to a Bishoprick that was capable of so black an Action  The next Morning Father  de la Chaise  coming to him to have the  List  of those who were named to the Benefices  Signed  as soon as the King saw this Abbot's Name underneath instead of signing he blotted it out The  Good Father  ask'd him what he did not understanding what he meant The  King  answer'd That there was a Man in that List who did not merit to be there that he knew nothing of him when he had given him a Bishoprick nor he himself could not have known him when he propos d him as a fit Person but that he had been since justly represented to him and that the oversight he had committed had almost thrown him into Despair This reflected in some measure upon the  Good Father  who had told him Wonders of this Man the more to oblige those who had recommended him and perhaps he himself believ'd all was told him to the advantage of that Person However the Jesuit altogether amaz'd at these Expressions made use of the Authority he had over his  Conscience  to oblige him to change his Resolution Though it was easy for him to judge by what the King had said that of necessity some People had given him a strange Character of that poor Abbot yet he said That  we must not believe upon light grounds all that we hear of our Neighbour that he had often recommended to him the reading of the little Book of the  Imitation  of  Jesus  and there he might see a Chapter done purposely upon that Subject that  Lying  abounded in a great measure amongst Men as well as Jealousy insomuch that his Majesty's Bounty was sufficient to move all the Malice of Hell against him  The King having hearken'd attentively to what he said reply'd  That it was no Lye they told him as he imagin'd that it was a thing happen'd lately in the presence of a great many that he also knew the Witnesses insomuch that he had not the least ground to doubt of it  The  Good Father  desir'd to know what the matter was the King made no Secret of it adding moreover  That if Fame was to be credited that Abbot was no less a Lover of the  Sex  than of Game  And in effect this was told the King with a great deal of assurance but whether he lov'd them or no for I know no body hates them it was certain that he gave no Scandal to the World that way as his Enemies alledg'd so the King was soon perswaded that he was impos'd upon in that Affair However Father  de la Chaise  seeing that the other was a weighty Accusation and that the King kept close to it he thought of throwing some scruple into his Mind He told him then That there was more of Infirmity than of Crime in what the Abbot had done that it was certain it was rather out of Complaisance than Inclination or want of due Respect to these  HolyDays  that he had handled the Cards at that time that very few People knew of this his fault but now all  France  would begin to pry into it and even suspect an infinity of things as soon as his  Majesty  should deprive him of what he had once conferr'd upon him that his  Majesty  ought  to be very cautions in giving that Scandal to his People that certainly he must be answerable for it before  God  That a small Reproof given in secret to that  Abbot  would prevail more with him and oblige him to ask  God  pardon for what he had done and by this means all would be buried in Oblivion that after all it ought not to be regarded as a heinous fault but in respect to the time it was committed for he was not the only Ecclesiastick who a had Passion for  Game  since there were many  Bishops  and  Abbots  who made it their principal Exercise though after all they were not depriv'd of their  Bishoprick  and  Abbots  upon that account He own'd freely to his  Majesty  it were more decent for them not to do it and was of Opinion that these things ought to be none of their Diversions But in fine the Spirit of Mankind is weak and there being four and twenty Hours in the Day it is impossible to employ them all in Exercises of Piety and therefore they are allow'd to refresh themselves with innocent Recreations  The King had no great opinion of this Morality he thought it too loose especially with regard to those Men who were the Subject of the Discourse For he put a vast difference betwixt them and a Courtier or a Man of the Sword whom he thought might be allow  d such things but to believe that Ecclesiasticks ought to have the same extent of freedom was a thing with all due Respect to his  Father Confessor  he could never be perswaded off So it being impossible to convince his Majesty by this Objection he was fain to have recourse to some other Argument He insisted upon the Scandal he was like to give but that gaining nothing upon him he pray  d him to advise with Heaven before he would determine absolutely the matter His  Majesty  consented willingly For in  that he demanded only what became a good Christian and was conformable to the Inclination of this Prince So the King kneeling that very minute upon a Cushion Father  de la Chaise  kneel'd by him to make him say the Prayers which he desir'd Prayers being ended the  Good Father  ask'd him what return the  Lord  made His  Majesty  reply'd  Nothing of what you wish'd for and that he was as resolute as formerly to execute his design  He added  That he saw it very inconvenient not to do it for if he should make that  Abbot  a  Bishop  and if he should neglect his Duty in his Diocess God Almighty would one day call him to an Account for it that he had faults enough of his own to answer for without taking upon him those of other People and he believ'd him too Good and too Pious to advise him otherwise  The  Good Father  was not yet put off with that Answer He ask'd of the  King  as the last Favour to suspend his Resolution until he should return from  Mass  whither he was just agoing He conjur'd him to invoke earnestly the  Holy Ghost  that he might enlighten him The  King  condescended very willingly but not having receiv'd the Inspiration which the  Good Father  pretended he declar'd  That he had blotted that Abbot out of the  List  because he did not believe him so proper for a Bishoprick as he at first imagin'd  The poor  Abbot  of  Coadles  heard of these News with all the Surprisal and Grief imaginable He retir'd into a  Seminary  there to bury his Vexation However the King calling to mind what Father  de la Chaise  had said to him and being desirous that he should be suspected of nothing but the  Truth  declar'd at the same time before all the Court  That what that Abbot had done in the  Holy Week  was the only cause of his Misfortune that whatever else was said of him was false and that he was oblig'd to give that Testimony in his Favour  The  King  having show'd himself so full of the fear of  God  in an Affair of so great Consequence shew'd himself equally full of Justice in another Affair that concern'd a Man of the same Country Which was as follows a Counsellor of the Parliament of  Britany  call'd  Montchamp  having cudgell'd the Nephew of  Moreau  the famous  Actress  in the Opera and who gave some ground to speak of her upon an account different from what she acted upon the  Theatre  the young Man carried his Complaint to his  Majesty  The Counsellor expected that his Interest in the Parliament in whose Assembly that Affair was done would shelter him from all Accidents He treated already that Man very slightingly and meanly But the Lady of that Opera whom Persons of the first Quality ador'd having espous'd her Nephew's Quarrel obtain'd a private Letter in his favour This Letter enjoyn'd the Parliament expresly to do the Plantiff so good and so ready Justice that he should have no reason to complain of it  Montchamp  understanding by these means that he had to do with a more powerful Party than he thought of had recourse to such Tricks as are usual among the People of his Trade He made a diligent Inquiry into the Life not of the Aunt for it had been no difficulty in the least to prove a great many things of her but of the Nephew For he thought that if he could d  s  over any unwarrantable Action in it as he hop'd he might he could at least retard the Process which his Adversary had commenc'd against him However not trusting very much to these hopes he was fain to fall upon other Measures to get rid of this unlucky hit and therefore intreated the Marshal of  Cr  's Lady who was his Relation to cause an Accommodation to be propos'd to  M  r    This  Actress  was no sooner apply'd to than she stood aloof The  Marshal  's Lady threaten'd her with the discovery the  Counsellor  made in her Nephew's Life on purpose to fright her But whether she was afraid of nothing from that Faction or that she thought she had Friends enough to protect her she carried her Pretensions so high as to demand Ten thousand Crowns of the  Marshal  's Lady for her Nephew's Interest and Damages As soon as the Lady had acquainted her Relations that there was no hopes of an Accommodation for him he spoke very scornfully of such an exorbitant Demand so applying himself altogether to a vigorous Defence he would certainly have confounded the opposite Party if the Parliament had condescended to it He gave in a Petition against the  Plaintiff  shewing that he had two Wives He desir'd to have a Decret pass'd against him but bringing no valid proof for his Accusation the  Parliament  durst not declare in his Favour for fear of a Reprimand from the Court For the secret Letter which they had receiv'd together with a Letter from the  AttourneyGeneral  of the Parliament of  Paris  gave them to know that they must proceed justly if they meant not to have their  Sentence  liable to a Revisal Above all they were afraid of the  Aunt  's Friends suspecting very much that if they gave them the least ground of Complaint they should have them more than her for their Adversaries In fine  Montchamp  failing in his Expectation and not being able to produce any Proof for what he alledg'd though he had employ'd some considerable Persons in it Sentence was pronounc'd upon the Affair He was suspended for six Months and having receiv'd a Reprimand behind the  Bench  he was condemn'd to pay the costs He had made an offer before of Four thousand Livres to  his Adversary but by the Calculation made of the Charges they did not amount to so much which was no small Mortification for our  Actress M  r  au  For had it depended upon her she had protested against the  Sentence  But the Gentlemen of the  Robe  assur'd her she would fail in the attempt so that she was fain to condescend against her Inclination  As  Britany  furnishes us thus with an instance of  Violence  committed upon the Person of one of her Publick  Magistrates  so  Paris  produc'd somewhat like it in the Son of one of her's but what is something more it was executed upon a Person of  Quality  The Marquis of  Novion  Son to the late Monsieur  Novion  Master of the  Rolls  and Brother to the present Monsieur  Novion President  of the  Soveraign Court  falling in Love with a certain  Chanoinesse  whose Mother was of the same Family with Monsieur  de Caumartin  he humour  d her to that degree that he promis'd as is alledg'd to revenge her Quarrel upon a Gentleman of whom she complain'd heavily She was extreamly vex'd that this Gentleman who call'd himself the Knight of St  Geniers  should have pressed her somewhat too hard to pay him some Money that he alledg'd he had lent her He had been formerly her  Lover  but whether she pretended that when once a Man is in Love with a Woman he ought to give and not lend or that he had demanded his Money after a rude manner she had told the Marquiss so often that this Gentleman was troublesome to her that he was charg'd with what I am now to recount The  Knight  of St  Geniers  passing one Day along a Street that was pretty near his former Mistriss's Lodgings was attack'd by five or six  Bravado  's of  Paris  who are always at a short distance from one another when they design any thing And their Valour consists  only in that which has some Relation to what Monsieur  de Turenne  was us'd to say namely  That  God Almighty  was always of the strongest side  In effect their Train obliges those who would have no regard for them upon the lay of Man for Man to shew them some Respect But whether it was upon that account or that the  Knight  being one of  Maltha  own'd no Enemy but a  Turk  he had no Inclination to meddle with this Man But this pretended  Hero  who had serv'd his Apprenticeship to Slaughtering being the Son of a Butcher seeing the Knight took no notice of some small Indignities he had given him had a mind to know whether or no he had forgot his first Trade though some time ago he had exchang'd it for the  Rapier  He meant therefore to slit his Nose and perform'd it so dexterously that all the Nose was left the poor  Knight  hung by one small Tendon and he had certainly cut it off quite had he not been hinder  d by some People who interpos'd but he made his escape while the  Knight  's Wound was a dressing The whole Town was immediately alarm'd at the boldness of this Action It was no great difficulty for the  Knight  to judge who had hatch'd this Mischief and therefore as soon as the Chyrurgion had dress'd him he went immediately and made his Complaint to the  Commiss  y  The  Lieu  enant Criminal  gave out a Warrant against the Bravado and some other certain Gentlemen who accompanied him in the Exploit But as to the  Marquiss  the  Chanoinesse  and her Mother whom the Knight had likewise accus'd he had some more Consideration for them for the Respect he had for their Relations oblig'd him to proceed very nicely against them He thought it sufficient to Issue out a personal Summons against the three The Mother and the Daughter made their Compearance and were interrogated But the  Marquiss  of  Novion  durst not show his Countenance in regard his  Bully  had been so foolish as to suffer himself to be apprehended But he retir'd to a Friend's House hoping that by his Reputation in the  Robe  he might save the Guilty from a just Punishment But his  Majesty  being inform'd of the whole Affair by one of the  Knight  's Friends commanded the Matter to be examin'd very strictly so that the  Marquiss  was fain to leave  Paris  and save himself by flying to  Swisserland  It  happy for these Women that they never had either seen or heard of this Bully insomuch that he not being able to accuse them they were without any farther difficulty absolv'd from their personal Summons However the  Bully  was sentenc'd by the  LieutenantCriminal  to be hang'd nor could he avoid giving of that  Sentence  However desirous he was to oblige the  Marquiss  's Family The  Marquiss  's Friends advis'd the Criminal to fear nothing for the Parliament to whom he had appeal'd would infallibly clear him But the Knight suspecting the matter prevented their threatnings and petition'd the King to give him other Judges which he obtain'd The  Appeal  instead of being brought before the Parliament according to the usual Custom was brought before the Great Council The Measures of the  Marquiss  's Friends and Relations being by this means quite defeated they advis'd him to keep himself close where he was for seeing his Affairs had taken so fatal a turn it was by no means safe for him to return into the Kingdom But being Colonel of the Regiment of  Britany  and all the World believing him guilty a great many People made Interest to have his Regiment Monsieur  de Boveron  the Marquiss of  Harcourt  s Father ask'd it for the Marquiss of  Sesane  his eldest Son  of a second Marriage For he had married for his second Wife the Marquis of  Genles  's Widow who was the late Marshal  de Fabert  's youngest Daughter  The  Marquis  's Relations were sensible of what importance it was for them to weather this Storm for if once the  King  dispos'd of his Regiment it would not only prove a mortal Stroke to his Fortune that was already pretty low but the World would also look upon it as a sort of Conviction against him They therefore supplicated his  Majesty  that he would be pleas'd to delay that Affair for some small time promising to oblige their Kinsman to return quickly in order to clear himself of the Crime laid to his charge and alledging he was reduc'd to mean Circumstances upon which account it would be equally acceptable to take away his Life as his Regiment The King in consideration of their Services granted their Request And the Marquis of  Sesane  was oblig'd to provide for himself somewhere else if he meant to have a Regiment However this made no stop in the  Appeal  of the  Condemn'd Criminal  for the  Sentence  being confirm'd when he perceiv'd that all their fine Promises were not sufficient to save him from a Rope he charg'd the Marquis of  Novion  with the Crime at his Death This  Sentence  satisfied in some measure the Knight's Revenge who always saw the Marks of his Affront when he look'd into his Glass For tho' his Nose was stitch'd up yet the Seam appearing was no small Mortification to him so that he could never be at ease until he had the same Satisfaction of others that he had already of the  Bully  He prosecuted them very eagerly before the same Tribunal However he could never have his Revenge of them as he pretended for though he prevail'd so far as to have the Cause remov'd from before  the Parliament where the  Marquis  had a great many Friends and Relations and generally all Judges stick close by one another yet to this minute the Affair remains undecided For they started so many difficulties that it is impossible for one of a more considerable Interest than his to remove them besides to plead in Criminal Matters requires a more weighty Purse than his and yet could easily exhaust it In the mean time another Adventure happen  d to President  Novion  ▪s Nephew and however extraordinary the first appear'd yet it bears no proportion with this I am about to mention now  This President's Wife was a Gentleman's Daughter whose Office it was to give out the Powder by which he had got immense Sums of Money She had a Sister by her first Marriage who was the Widow of a certain Man call  d  Ombreval  AdvocateGeneral of the Court of  Aides  by whom she had some Children and amongst the rest a Son of one or two and twenty Years old He studied the Law that he might succeed his Father in his Profession This young Gentleman coming from the  LawSchool  saw two Jesuits passing along and at the same time a Cart loaded with Bundles of Rods then he told his Companions that these  Dis  ples  of St  Ignatius  had often whipp  d him in the College and he had a good mind to be reveng'd of them now that he found his opportunity he mean'd to bang them like  BridewelBirds  and to that intent each of them might take a Bundle of these Rods from the Cart and oblige these good Fathe's to ask them Pardon for all the Cruelty they had made them suffer before In all appearance he had only said this to divert himself But his Companions understanding him literally the most foolish and most bold of 'em leap'd upon the Ca  t and in spite of the Carman unty'd the Bundles took up handfulls  of the Rods and like so many Furies fell upon the poor Jesuits who never dreamt of the like Adventure There was no great matter of Ceremony in the Compliment they made them They told them only they had often oblig'd them to pull down their Breeches against their Inclination and now they meant to do the like to them that common Justice requir'd they should pay them presently for all the Evil they had suffer'd by them and they would make them sensible by which means they intended to perform it This Folly appear'd so extravagant that the two Jesuits could never understand what they meant But these  Furies  made them to know very quickly by falling suddenly upon them that its altogether as dangerous to fall into the Hands of  Scholars  as into the Hands of the most barbarous  Hangman  upon Earth Some pull'd off their Cloaks others their Gowns while another Party unty'd their Breeches another pull'd up their Shirts the young  Ombreval  serv  d for Executioner together with another of the same Family who had consign'd his Money in order to be a Councellor of Parliament  All the People got to the Windows upon the noise these poor Jesuits made to call to the Neighbours for Assistance and among others a pretty young Girl who was more zealous than the rest to hinder them from receiving any greater Affront cry'd aloud that it deserv'd a severe Punishment as in effect it did but perceiving she was not heard she went down Stairs to see if her  Presence  could have a greater Influence than her  Words  but alas her Charity cost her very dear For these Scholars who were far from having so much good nature as she seeing her espouse so earnestly the part of these good Fathers that she reproach'd them for their Injustice seiz'd her also pull'd up her  Peticoats behind and whipp'd her as they had done the Jesuits After that she pleaded no more for them but as soon as she got out of their Hands she run in and shut the Doors and got up to her Chamber in great Confusion and Vexation at her Adventure The Jesuits had reason to be no less vex'd However though the same fate happen'd to them all they having been all three whipp'd in the open Streets there was still this difference in the Sequel that the Adventure prov'd more fatal to the Girl than to them The Fraternity receiv'd them always with the same kindness into the Convent They vow'd also to revenge it in a little time or dye in the Attempt whereas the Girl was abandon'd by her Lover and swore he would not have her they had agreed upon their Marriage and the Articles had been already sign'd but he fearing that if he proceeded further he might be call'd all over the Town  The Husband of the whipp'd Girl  could not endure to hear it spoken of They threaten'd to prosecute him if he did not make good his Promise He answer'd  He valu'd it not and that he would defend himself the best way he could  and its probable his Reasons might have prevail  d for every one condemn'd the Indiscretion of the Girl to meddle where she was so little concern'd  This Action was too publick and too bold not to spread in an instant over all  Paris  Monsieur  D' Argenson  had soon advice of it and it being his Duty to find out Criminals he sent so many of his Spies abroad that he soon discover'd young  Ombreval  to be one of them He also knew that this Gentleman began the Fray and was one of the Executioners through whose Hands those Jesuits had pass'd He likewise found out the other's Name who had executed the same Office and caus'd them both to be taken up President  Novion  was extreamly offended at him as if he ought to have that deference for him as not to treat after that manner a Person that concern'd him so nearly But this Vanity and Haughtiness were very familiar to that Family though it was of a far later standing than Monsieur  D' Argenson  's Before St  Innocent  's  Shrine  was alter'd which was but lately we had an  Epitaph  extant that shows sufficiently they have neither so much  Nobility  nor  Grandeur  in their  Race  as they would make the World believe It is far different from what we see at this time in the  Celestines  where the Duke of  Gevres  one of that Family would have us believe that he is lineally descended from St  Louis  Though the Family be only come from a  Merchand  one  Fourner  who made his Son an  Advocate  and that Son laid the Foundation of the vast  Grandeur  However it be President  Novion  minding that less than the Post he possess'd thought himself far above Monsieur  D' Argenson  and wrote to him very disrespectfully upon what he had done Monsieur  D' Argenson  regarding his Letter very little went on in his ordinary Course so that the  President  was fain to take his Nephew out of Prison and his Companion came out after the same manner Both of them had a good many Friends and the Accusation they were charg'd with being destitute of Proof sufficient to bring them to a Tryal they were very happily clear'd of it This was all the Jesuits had for their Satisfaction and the poor whipp'd Girl for her's besides the Mortification of having miss'd of a Husband together with the Grief and Indignity she receiv'd  In the mean time the  New King  of  England  sent a  New Ambassador  to Court namely the Earl of  Portland  his old Favourite For the Earl of  Albemarle  only succeeded to him if I may say so for though he was his  Britannick  Majesty's Darling  yet  Portland  was in as good Terms with his Master as ever Moreover he had this advantage over the other that besides the Favour which was common to them both he was confided in This  Earl  renew'd that  Grandeur  at our Court which was to be seen in the time of the Duke of  Buckingham  when he came to demand in Marriage for the  King  his  Master Mary Henrietta  of  France  Sister to  Louis  XIII of glorious Memory I mean by this that he came with such a stately and magnificent Equipage that the like had not been seen of a long time with an Ambassador He had a permission to bring over with him some  Frenchmen  who had gone into  England  after the Revocation of the Edict of  Nants  and who never durst have ventur'd to return afterwards without a Passport However  Degrez  whom the Court had employ'd to take up  Ministers  and other Persons of that Religion look'd upon this as a favourable opportunity for him and did not fail to make his advantage of it It being his ordinary Custom to render every Person suspected in order to make the best of his Trade he upon a certain Day took up one of the Ambassador's  Ministers  while he thought of going to see one of his Friends who was an  Advocate  It was very happy for this  Advocate  that he had been all along a Catholick for that  Quality  and his wise Conduct shelter'd him from the evil Designs of this  Kidnapper  whose Gain it was to cast every one in Prison He told him freely his Sentiments of such proceedings for he had no Orders to do what he did then but it was his ordinary practice that he might be thought the more  Zealous  though all his  Zeal  consisted only in his Interest The  Minister  ask'd him what it was he accus  d him of and why he made his Prisoner after that manner he being the Ambassador of  England  ▪s  Domestick to whom only he was oblig'd to give an account of his Conduct It was upon that score that the Advocate exclaim'd against  Degrez  making him to know that the Court would never approve of such Proceedings  Degrez  found himself oblig'd to answer all those Demands which the Advocate back'd with all the Arguments he could invent telling him That he engag'd himself as well as the King in an unwarrantable Action The Wound that the War had given to  France  was still bleeding and  Degrez  knowing that all this Mischief was brought upon them by the Ambassador's  Master  he thought he was oblig'd to give him some Reason for what he had done He told him that the  Minister  had administred the Sacrament to one of his Religion and had sent for him to that end to the Ambassador's House and that being forbid it was very warrantable for him to take him up as he did And thus he was not afraid to declare himself Sacrilegious the better to colour his Design In effect 'tis true that was prohibited but 'tis as true that the Minister was never guilty of it and therefore desired to see the Person who accus'd him Now  Degrez  had brought a Fellow along with him to the Advocate's Door who had indeavour'd to impose upon the Clergyman For this Rascal had pretended to be a Protestant and apply'd himself to the Minister to procure him a Passport for  England  The Minister was in effect impos'd upon He believ'd him in good earnest to be some poor Man whom the Zeal for his Religion oblig'd to quit his Country and Friends but knowing that was not permitted he endeavour'd to comfort him without giving him any other relief But the Rascally Fellow had no mind to tell his Master that answer or if he had  Degrez  pleaded ignorance However  the Minister was so exceedingly vex'd at this Calumny that if his Character had allow'd him to meddle with any of them he had doubtless bang'd the Villain to some purpose But that being impracticable he desir'd  Degrez  to cause arrest him and told him if he refus'd it he must be answerable for it to my Lord  Portland  and that the  King  their  Master  was capable to do himself Justice and he might come to hear of it in a short time The Advocate added That he might find it to his disadvantage These Expressions put the little Gentleman into a fright he went to Monsieur  D'Argenson  to know of him how to behave in the matter His Officers had always an eye upon the Minister after that but Monsieur  D'Argenson  found that the Advocate had advis'd him well and commanded him to put his advice in Execution In fine he was forc'd to send his Man to Prison and set the Minister at liberty according to the Order that Monsieur  D'Argenson  had given him It's certain this false Witness deserv'd to be hang'd or at least to be sent to the Gallies to teach all those of the like Kidney prudence upon their own expences But as the wick'd find favour rather than honest Men whose misfortune brings them into any inconveniency they delay'd to proceed against him until my Lord  Portland  was gone and then they set him at liberty  All the Court show'd this  Ambassador  singular Marks of Honour The  Daup  ine  the Duke of  Orleans  and all the great Lords of the Court invited him to Dinner while he for his part kept a very splendid Table The Count of  Auvergne  youngest Son to the Duke of  Bouillon  gave him the use of his Lodgings while he stay'd at  Paris  and himself went in the mean time to  Holland  to  his Wife's Estate who died there about that time This  Ambassador  had at his Entry a hundred Liverymen and six Coaches three with eight Horses and three with six and continued the same Grandeur all the time he stay'd at Court He always made his Visits with all that Attendance to let the World see how little he resembled a great many of that Quality who discharge three parts of their Equipage the next day after their Entry so that he spent almost a hundred thousand Crowns in the two Months that his Embassy lasted  King  James  pass'd his time very indifferently all that while He heard from all hands the Honour done to my Lord  Portland  which was such as perhaps was never shown before to any  Ambassador  This made some People believe that there were some Alliances on foot betwixt the two Kings and the more because my Lord  Portland  had three or four Private Audiences of his  Majesty  However while some  French  People suspected that they thought of dividing  Flanders  between them two after the Death of the King of  Spain  whose Health was very infirm it came to be known that these private Audiences were upon a very different Subject My Lord  Portland  insisted upon the removing of King  James  at a farther distance from the King's Presence promising in his Master's Name to give him and the  Queen  a Pension sufficient to excuse his  Majesty  from the Expence he had been at upon that Prince since he had made a Sanctuary of his Dominions But the King would never give ear to it which exceeded King  James  's Expectation who in case the  King  had abandon'd him was resolv'd to retire to  Avignion  for he began already to inform himself  if he could live conveniently there For as the King was oblig'd in Policy to make Peace with his Enemy though he had promis'd never to make it until he had restor'd him to his Crown he was afraid that the same Policy might also induce him to grant what was demanded  The King of  Spain  's Malady increasing every Moment insomuch that it was generally thought he had few days to live did not only move all the Powers of  Europe  to delay the Reform of their Troops after the Peace but likewise retarded the Evacuation of some Places which his Majesty was oblig'd to Surrender However the Marquis of  Harcourt  receiv'd Orders to go with all di  igence to the Court of  Madrid  with this  Instruction  that if he saw no probability as in effect there was none to bring the Succession of his Catholick Majesty to fall upon one of the  Dauphine  's Sons he should endeavour at least to hinder its coming to any of his Imperial Majesty's Children For it was to the Emperor and his Descendants that  Philip  IV the present King of  Spain  's Father had left it by his Will And the  Emper  r  becoming already very powerful by his Conquests in  Hungary  he was thereby become so suspected to his  Majesty  that he was resolv'd to have recourse to his Arms rather than suffer it to fall into his Hands And accordingly to fright the  Spaniards  he caus'd to file off Sixty thousand Men to the Frontiers of  Italy Catalonia  and  Navarre  He was sensible that would add some weight to his Ambassador's Discourses and might also awaken the Ambition of some Grandee of the Country  The Marquiss was no sooner arriv'd in  Spain  than he apply'd himself to business He told those who were capable to act in concert with him in an Affair of such importance that  Philip  IV had gone beyond his Power when he pretended to dispose of his Crown at pleasure against the Laws of Nature That it belong'd lawfully to his Daughter's Children and not to his Relations in the fourth Degree who could pretend to no Right of themselves That the  Dauphine  had three Sons and the Duke of  Burgundy  's second Brother was still as pliable as wax whom they could Mould into any Form they pleas'd and if they would fix their Eye upon him they might easily breed him to their own Customs that if this fail'd the Prince of  Bavaria  being Grand son to a Daughter of  Spain  the King his Master would rather approve of his Election than of the Emperor's or of any of his Children unless they had a mind to follow the Example of the  Poles  who to oblige  Strangers  to agree among themselves had twice chosen a Sovereign of their own Country And this was all the King pretended to considering he could not expect to bring the Crown of  Spain  into his own Family But the Queen of  Spain  having a watchful Eye upon the Conduct of this Ambassador who made it his business to renverse her Designs pry'd narrowly into his Intrigues and remov'd the King her Husband some distance from  Madrid  under pretence that the Air was prejudicial to his Health She carried him to  Toledo  and pretending it was only upon the account of his Health would allow no body to follow him thither Nay she left some Ministers that she confided in at  Madrid  in order to receive whatever any of the Ambassadors had a mind to  offer The Marquis  de Harcourt  saw clearly with what view the Queen made this Journey and that she intended to be so fully Mistriss of the King her Husband's Inclinations that she could obtain of him whatever she had a mind to He fear'd she might prevail with him to confirm  Philip  IV's Will and at the same time observ'd that the Count  de H  rrach  was no more to be seen at  Madrid  and in all probability was gone to  Toledo  upon this he went immediately thither also under pretence of having receiv'd a Memorial which he forg'd from the King his  Master  with positive Orders to communicate it to his Catholick  Majesty  The Queen of  Spain  who did not in the least expect it was extreamly surpriz'd to see him there and caus'd the King her Husband to whom he presented his  Memorial  to acquaint him That he had left the Cardinal of  Corduba  at  Madrid  on purpose to whom he might have communicated his Memorials as well as to him that his principal Intention for coming thither was to recover his Health and not to trouble himsel  with Business and therefore he might apply himself to the  Cardinal  in all Affairs of  State  However considering that the Memorial was not very long and that in all appearance it tended to his own advantage he thought he was oblig'd to answer it himself One thing to be consider'd is that the King of  Morocco  had for a long time besieg'd the Fortress of  Ceuta  in  Barbary  which belong'd to his Catholick  Majesty  but could never take it Nor was the King of  Spain  in circumstances to raise the Siege though he had attempted it several times In all appearance these  did not carry it on very vigorously whether they were ignorant how to  carry it on or that they thought the  Conquest  the more Glorious after a Siege of so many Years His most Christian  Majesty  by this Memorial offer'd to the King of  Spain  if he pleas'd to send Men of War and Gallies to succour that place His Catholick Majesty had enough of his own for such an Enterprize without being oblig'd to borrow of any other Prince But he was so treacherously serv'd by him whom he had entrusted with his Orders that instead of executing them he deserted to the Enemies Nay he did much worse for not being satisfied to Renounce his Master only he renounc'd also  Jesus Christ  which was esteem'd so great an encouragement for these  Infidels  that after that they thought they had gain'd all Such an accident in effect confounded all the Governors his  Catholick Majesty  had upon that Coast and this was the Subject or rather the Pretence of the  French  Ambassador's Memorial But whether his Catholick Majesty had no mind to accept of such suspected Succours or that he thought he could do without them he thank'd the  Ambassador  for the proffer observing with him at the same time all the measures of Civility that were proper for the occasion However he who had renounc'd his  King  and his  Faith  beginning to be sensible of his fault and to repent of it confess'd that he was a  Christian  and abhorr'd his  Apostacy  But the  Infidels  who had made a great deal of noise of his change expecting to oblige him to return to them by the force of  Presents  and  Promises  indeavour'd to regain him but seeing him continue in his Repentance and that there was no possibility of bringing him over again to them they threaten'd to treat him as they usually do  Apostates  from their  Religion  I mean they threaten'd to Empale  him after torturing But he expected no less and was fully resolv'd to undergo all being extream glad to expiate by these Torments the heinous Crime he had committed against his  God  and his  King  So being no ways frighten'd by their Menaces he submitted himself very freely to all the Torments they could invent In  ine in the middle of these dismal Torments he joyfully confess'd him whom he had denied upon which they put him at last to Death least by his Constancy some amongst them might be mov'd to acknowledge that he suffer'd for a good Cause in regard he seem'd so insensible of Pain in his Torments  After this Answer the Marquis of  Harcourt  was obliged to return to  Madrid  and endeavour'd by all means possible to gain the People by a very agreeable Conduct his Wife the  Marchioness  came also from  France  to second him For having an infinite deal of Wit she thought to infinuate her self by degrees into the Queen's Affection and gain her Confidence by the means of some Proposals she believ'd would prove mightily to her Advantage with regard to her Person It was highly presumptuous in her to entertain that thought To be sure her  Majesty  would be much upon her guard against her for besides her being the Wife of a  M  narch  who is a capital Enemy to  France  there was not the least appearance she would hearken to any thing that came from that  Nation  The Queen of  Spain  notwithstanding her being a  German  began to conform her self to a Court where Trick and Policy are in Vogue as much as in any in the Universe and therefore se  gn'd presently to be exceedingly charm'd with the    to the  end she might the more easily know her Secrets The  Marchioness  told it to her Husband meaning to perswade him to rejoyce at it with her But the Ambassador though he had always been a Man more inclin'd to the Sword than the Court was yet cunning and advis'd her always to suspect so excessive Civility He told her it was not natural for the King of  Spain  's  Wife  to be so early in a good Correspondence with the Ambassador of  France  's Lady that it look'd like a Trick among those who knew better than to judge of things by appearance And therefore all he recommended to her was to be prudent that she ought to hear the  Queen  speak rather than speak her self and by these means she would certainly advance her Affairs much better than by endeavouring to be the Head of the Conversation  While these  Intrigues  proceeded after this manner the Princess of  Conti  the King's Daughter had some thoughts of marrying Mademoiselle  de Melan  eldest Daughter to the Princess of  Epinoi  to the Marquiss of  La Valiere  her CousinGerman she had a great Respect for her and went very often to  Paris  to see her and as for the Marquis he was in very good terms with the  Dauphine  She had it in her view at the same time to get him made  Duke  and  Peer  by obtaining from the  King  the  Title  of his  Dutchy  of  Vaujour  to her self in expectation of his succeeding to the Propriety of it after her Death This Land pertain'd for a long time to the House of  Bueil  and while it continu'd in that Family had only the Title of Marquisate but was erected into a Dutchy in  avour of Madam  de la Valiere  who since made her self a  Ca  ess  Monsieur  Colb  rt  who had  the Secret to get her into his Interest while she was a Favourite bought this Land for her by which means he ingratiated himself both in the King's Favour and her's It cost him only a hundred thousand Crowns though there was as much Wood upon it as would answer that Money which he sold in a short time after the Purchase However Mademoiselle  de Melan  flatter'd her self already with being a Dutchess very soon which was somewhat better than the imaginary Principality her Family flatter'd themselves with when the Princess of  Conti  came to know that his  Majesty  had no Inclination for that Marriage This made her shift sides and seeing the Duke of  Noailles  was in great Favour with the King she cast her Eyes upon one of his Daughters There was a whole Regiment of them and though there had been three of them already married yet there remain'd still such a number of them that he was the Person in all the Court the best provided with Means to make Sonsinlaw besides they strove who should have them For his  Majesty  had lately conferr'd a Favour upon him that evinced sufficiently the Esteem he had for him Madam  de M  i  n  n  had a Nicce who was the only Daughter of the Count of  Aubig    her Brother Governor of  Berry  and  Knight  of the  King  's Order This young Creature who was very lovely in her Person was much more such by the Favour and Merit of her  Aunt  who took particular care of her Education For she thought that her Father who lov'd his Game and Pleasures and by these means had ruin'd his Affairs so that he was oblig  d to retire in order either to pick up what might pay his Debts or to learn that he must die I say she  thought that her Father was in no Capacity to do any thing for her and therefore by her care she made her a very wellaccomplish'd young Lady and this Quality with all the others which she possess'd in an eminent degree made her the desirable Object of all the  Great Men  of the Court who had any Sons to Marry but there were particularly two who had a great design upon her namely the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  who would have given her the Prince of  Marsillac  his GrandSon the other the Duke of  Noailles  who had his eldest Son the Count of  Ayen  to Marry Either of these seem'd very advantageous for her though the first appear'd to be much more such than the last For in effect though the House of  Noailles  be very good and ancient yet the Family of  Rochefoucaut  exceeds it at least in the Opinion of a great many for all who pretend to know any thing of the  Grandeur  of  Families  make a great difference between them besides though the Duke of  Noailles  was Captain of the LifeGuards a very considerable Post the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  had two others which were fully as considerable and both of them carry great  Titles  which distinguish them from many others though in effect that of  Great Marshal  of the Lodgings is small enough for its Grandeur On the other hand there are a great many larger Estates in his Family than the Duke of  Noailles  can pretend to The Estate of  Noailles  that lies just by  Turenne  is nothing in comparison of  Wertheux  and of  Rocheg  yon  that must of necessity fall one day to the Prince of  Marsillac  without reckoning a great many other Lands which the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  and the Duke of  Rocheguyon  his  Father have so that every one believ'd that the Prince of  Marsillac  would carry the young Lady when the King declar'd himself in favour of the Count of  Ayen  The King himself gave her a Portion and not thinking it sufficient to give her eight hundred thousand Livers he also conferr'd so many Favours upon her Husband that a great many  Princes  and even  Princes  of the  Blood  would have been very glad to receive 'em He gave him the Survivance of the Government of  Roussillon  which the Duke of  Noailles  had that of the Government of  Berry  which the Count of  Aubignie  had a hundred thousand Livres in Jewels to the young Lady and in fine a great many other things that show'd no less the Magnificence of the  King  than the particular Friendship he had for their Relations And this demonstrated how much they were in the Right who courted the Alliance of the Duke of  Noailles  But the King as an additional Superabounding Favour gave the young Count his Shirt when he was ready to go to Bed while the Duchess of  Burgundy  perform'd the same Office to the young Lady One would have thought that there remain'd nothing to be done after so many Favours▪ But his Majesty who is an inexhaustible Fountain of Goodness gave each of them a Pension of eight thousand Livres a Years and to compleat the Work said  That provided the Count were a good Man he might assure himself he should never want for any thing  It being no mean thing to become a Brotherinlaw to such a Gentleman as this Madam the Princess of  Conti  manag'd the Match betwixt her Cosin and his Sister she secur'd to her his  Dutchy by the Contract of Marriage and the Affair being thus concluded the  Dauphine  conceiv'd so great a Friendship for the new married Gentleman that he could go no where without him He had him always by his side in his Coach as if they had but one Coach betwixt them both and lean'd his Head always to his as if he had been his Mistriss and in a sporting way call'd him  Violet  a Name that formerly was not much coveted being only proper for Footmen or that sort of Cattel but now became very fashionable amongst the Courtiers The  Dauphine  is naturally of a sweet Temper and an Enemy to all manner of Constraint He is not capable of having any great Inclination for Women and though he may have lov'd one or two of them knowing that the fair Sex requires complaisance he did not regard them so much upon the account of their easiness as of their Virtue  Dumont  one of his Masters of the Horse who was much in his Favour brought them always to him by Private Stairs when he wanted them and sent them immediately back when he had done This  Prince  chus'd them ordinarily amongst the Actresses of the Opera or Comedy upon which there happen'd to him a very pleasant Rencounter that deserves some place in this Work Having caus'd  Dumont  to speak to one of the Actresses of the Opera he agreed with her that she should come to  Meudon  to the end he might introduce her to the  Dauphin  's Closet by the private Stairs they condescended upon the Day and Hour The  Actress  though a Person void of Ceremony thought it not very decent to go thither alone and so brought one of her Sisters along with her The  Dauphine  had some Person with him in his Closet when they arriv'd which oblig'd  Dumont  to tell them to wait in a place where he posted them near the Closet at the same time he made it known to the  Dauphine  by a sign that his fair Lady was come to the end he might discharge his Company The  Dauphine  order'd him to go some where or other and in the mean time the  Dauphine  's Company judging they where somewhat inconvenient to him took there leave  Dumont  having left the private Door half open the Actress's Sister hearing no noise in the Room had the Curiosity to look into it The  Dauphine  who only waited for  Dumont  's return to have her Sister introduc'd having his Eyes fixt by chance that way where the other was looking no sooner saw a Woman's Coiffe at the Door but taking her to be the Person he had a mind to he desir'd her to come in She thought it good manners to obey though it was none of her he meant But whether his Eyes were somewhat Dim that Day or that he was in such haste that he had no time to consider her aright he gave her the same usage he design'd for her Sister After which having no further Inclination for the Lady's Conversation he sent her away immediately She told her Sister nothing of this Adventure The Actress still waited for  Dumont  and long'd much for his coming In fine he return'd by the Private Stairs and told her he was a going to speak to the  Dauphin  in order to bring her in The  Dauphine  told him  The he had had all the Conversation with her he intended and desir'd him to give her five hundred  Louis d'ores  and send her home Dumont  who had seen her very impatient to enter knew nothing of what he  meant by that and intreated the  Dauphine  to explain himself In fine he came to know what pass'd but not knowing with whom he went and told the  Actress  that if her Appetite was so very good it was not the same with the  Dauphine  's She was extreamly surpriz'd at his Complement but understood by it that her Sister had deceiv'd her and was so extreamly vext at it that she would never be reconcil'd with her till she condescended to divide the five hundred  Louis d'ores  with her which the  Dauphine  had sent to her  The furious War which the  King  had maintain'd against so many Potentates had encourag'd some of the new Converts to profess their former Religion notwithstanding the Prohibition to the contrary His  Majesty  caus'd to take up a great many of them in the Neighbourhood of  Orange  as they were returning thence from Sermon Some of them were treated very severely while others got off for a Month or two's Imprisonment The  King  set also Guards upon all the Avenues of that Town to hinder them from returning thither any more But not being intirely satisfied with this Precaution he made very strict Edicts against all such who should dare in prejudice of the Prohibition to venture to go thither again But this was not the only disobedience that appear'd in a short space of time for not one of them went to Mass And his Majesty being inform'd of it from all Parts and finding it a matter that ought to be remedied if he meant to prevent some dangerous Accidents deliberated with his Council how he ought to proceed against these obstinate People They were all at a loss how to advise him  upon that occasion insomuch that the Affair remained undecided and the King wrote to the most part of the  Bishops  and  Intendants  to have their Judgment in writing These differ'd in their Sentiments from one another Some advis'd him to make use only of Exhortations in order to make them Obedient others were for a severe usage Those who were of this last Sentiment were so much the more warm in it because they imagin'd though unjustly that the King of  England  had us'd these means with regard to the Catholicks of  Ireland  who not willing to submit to the present Government were fain to look for a Sanctuary in  France  to shelter themselves from the Punishment that was due to their Rebellion These People of all Ages and Conditions coming over in whole Troops to  France  never fail'd to spread abroad that they had been oblig'd to quit their Country in order to avoid the Violence that was done to their  Consciences  The  King  gave them five hundred Pistols in  Charity  which was thought but a small mite for so great a  King  However he appointed some Ladies of the Court to raise an Offering for them amongst the Persons of  Quality  The Curats of  Paris  follow'd that Example and caus'd also an Offering to be made in their Parishes to supply their Necessity But their being a great many  Monks  and  Priests  amongst these Refugees the  Archbishop  of  Paris  would have them to say their Masses in  Nô  re Dame  by way of Preference to all the  French Priests  who us'd to Celebrate 'em there He did them also particular Acts of Charity for being extraordinary Pious he omitted nothing that was in his Power for their Relief  In the mean time the Earl of  Jersey  Brother in Law to the Earl of  Portland  was Named by the King of  England  to succeed this last in  France  The King had no mind to speak to my Lord  Portland  of any thing that passed in  Ireland  least he might thence take occasion to speak to him of the Protestants in  France  He made him a present of his Picture richly set with Diamonds according to the ordinary Practice of this Court with a regard to all Embassadours  But there was this difference made betwixt him and others that the Diamonds upon the Present made to him were Three times more rich than they upon any others The King probably meant that his present should bear some proportion to the expences he had been at or perhaps knowing he was in good terms with his Master he was glad to have his favour upon occasion Some few Days before his departure the King made a review of his Houshold and King  James  was there as was also this  Lord  who perhaps had forborn coming if he had known that the other was to be there The  Prince  of  Wales  came thither also and had particular Orders from the King his Father to joyn Conversation with that  Lord  's Son to whom he had caused to insinuate before that he never pretended to make him answerable for what his Master had done against him This young Prince being only a Child was hardly capable of such an Entertainment but he had placed such Persons about him as were able to inform him and even continue the Discourse if necessary I do not know what he meant by it However my Lord  Portland  knowing the young Princes design sent to tell his Son to avoid him and himself shun'd all those of King  James  's Court The review being over he left  France  in a few Days after leaving a great esteem for him amongst all the Courtiers However before he went he was to see all the King's Houses in the Neighbourhood  of  Paris  and found them of a far different magnificence from his Majesty's Houses in  Holland  and  England  He went to  Chantilly  in his roade whither the  Prince  of  Conde  went a purpose to entertain him and thus here turned home extreamly satisfied with the Honour done him every where and gave an Account to his Master of all that passed in his Embassie This Prince was not ill pleas'd at the News of the King of  Spain  's sickness for it being upon that account that  France  continued still Arm'd he likewise kept up his Troops so as that the  English  could not find fault with it He knew his  Greatness  and  Safety  consisted in the Number of his Troops and having Enemies both within and without his Kingdom there was nothing more capable to gain him respect than to have always a good Army at his Command  This Prince having made it to appear upon all occasions that he had an infinite deal of Sense was not in the least mistaken upon this occasion For finding it his interest upon two Accounts to keep  France  continually in Arms both as it was a means to exhaust his Forces and as it wou'd prove always a good pretence for him to keep up his own Army He advis'd to have it ratified at the  Dyet of Ratisbon  that the Princes of the  Empire  should always keep up a Hundred and Twenty Thousand Men in Arms in the time of Peace for he was sensible the more they had the more  France  wou'd be obliged to have on that side And there being but a small distance betwixt  England  and  France  he wou'd by those means be always upon his Guard It was also believed that in Policy he asked of the King to remove  King James and his Wife  at a distance from him though he doubted the King would never consent to it But it would be such a pretence for him to show the  Parliament  that having a considerable Enemy so nigh him prudence would oblige him to keep  himself always in a condition to resist him in case of necessity  But whether he meant to enlarge upon that or that in effect  King James  who had attempted several times to remount his  Throne  by fomenting insurrections in  England  began to attempt the same again or whatever else was in it he caus'd a great many Persons to be taken up and among others the Earl of  Clancarty  as if he had meant to raise new troubles The Earl had been Captain of the Guards to  King James  and had passed once more before into that Country in Order to do him Service But he had no such design at this time He had only went thither under the benefit of the Peace though the New King had excluded him from it as he had done a great many others who had continued after a certain time in the Service of his Enemy However this Earl being a Person of quality his Imprisonment made no little noise for instead of sending him to the Tower they put him up in Newgate This was by no means disagreeable to the  King  for the more the  Prisoner  was a Man of  quality  the greater Impression his return into the Country made upon the minds of the People for they knew he was guilty the last time he came into the  Kingdom  because he had made his Escape out of the Tower For at that time he proposed to a  Lady  of quality who came to see him to allow him to make his escape under her Petticoats This Lady being as large as he was little condescended very willingly at the Peril of whatever could happen For besides the apprehension she was under of being catch'd in the Commission of a flaming Crime and being kept Prisoner her self she allowed his approaches to a place with which the  Ladies  hardly suffer such near communication at least without some scruple whatever was in it he played his Game so well that  he made his escape without being discovered and from that time kept always about King  James  till the time of his being retaken that I mentioned but now  It was a long time before the  English  could be sensible of any pretence their King had to keep any Troops on Foot in the present posture of the Affairs of  Europe  in General or of their own in Particular On the other Hard it was given out a pretty while before that His Christian  Majesty  was to have a Camp near  Campiegne  where the Duke of  Burgundy  was to Command And though it was said publickly it was designed only to let him see something in warlike affairs and to accustom him by degrees to such great things as were due to his Birth yet it bred some Jealousie so that the  English  continued still quiet But the Natural restlessness of that  Nation  never allows them to be long at ease In fine they complained that being exhausted by the War it was impossible for them to continue the same expences in the time of Peace The  King  of  England  thinking to satisfie them in some degree made a reform of some Regiments and of others he sent some into  Holland  and some into  Ireland  believing that these being once out of their sight they would be apt to forget them but they still insisted upon their former complaints And to speak the truth they had good politick Reasons to do what they did not only with regard to themselves but also with regard to all  Europe  In the mean time the Encampment which the King intended was put off to  September  to the end that the People in the Neighbourhood might have opportunity to make their Harvest and gather in all their Corn so in this interval of time there fell out some remarkable things at Court One of the most considerable which perhaps has no parallel in this Age was as follows  Monsieur de Pelletier  who had been  Controler General  of the  Finances  and whom the King had made an  Officer  of  State  quitted a Hundred Thousand Livers a Year which he possessed by the King's liberality to be freed from all manner of business and have time to mind his Salvation His  Majesty  had a mind to allow him some Pension and was so much the more earnest to do it because he cou'd never sufficiently admire such a resolution but after all his remonstrances he only prevailed so far as to oblige him to accept of Twenty Thousand Livers a Year to maintain a Table for his Family His place in the  Posthouse  which was valued at Two and Thirty Thousand Livers a Year was given to  Monsieur Pomponne  Who however Pious he was thought to be thought such a Post not inconsistent with his Devotion  Monsieur Pelletier  retir'd immediately to his  Castle  of  V  lle Neuf  within Three or Four Leagues of  Paris  and discarded the most part of his Domesticks His Brother who was  Intendant  of the  Finances  being angry that he had not Named him to his Majesty for  Comptrouler General  of the  Finances  when he quited it was exceedingly vexed because he had not acquainted him with his Intention in order to fall upon measures to make some advantage of his spoil  Moreover he went the next Day to  Versailles  and told the King without waiting in the least for what his Majesty had a mind to say upon the Subject that though it was generally said in the World that the  Younger  ought to follow the example of the  Elder  yet he would take care not to imitate his Brother that in effect he was so far from believing that his  Majestie's  Service cou'd in the  ast hurt his Salvation that on the contrary there was nothing more useful either for this World or the World to come So that his Majesty might when he thought fit load him with more business without  giving him the least disturbance that he would always continue in his ordinary road without ever thinking of shuting himself up either in a  Cloyster or a Country House  He was easily believed without swearing for every Body was sensible how little inclination he had to quit the World Besides the World knew that he was not a Man who troubled himself very much with business he never lov'd to overcharge himself for of whatever Consequence the Affair was his Buildings and Garden were first look'd after Not but that he had a great deal of Sense and in that even exceeded his Eldest Brother but being of their Judgment who believe that  Charitie begins as home  he never car'd to bely a Maxim which  time  and  custom  had so well established in the World  While both the Court and King admired  Monsieur Pelletiers  Conduct There fell out an accident betwixt two Courtiers at  Marli  that had proved of a more troublesom consequence if it had not been moderated by the  Bystanders  The matter was this  the Count of Auvergne  was playing at  Omber  with some other Lords and  Monsieur de Lausun  looki  g over them began to utter a great many silly expressions which vex'd the  Count  insomuch that he threw down his Cards The Gamsters asked him what he meant the  Count  answered that it was impossible to play while he heard Monsieur  Lausun  's  edious Discourse and as for him he could not have the complaisance to relish it  Monsieur Lausun  being always sensible of the honour he had in marrying  Henry  IV his Grandchild and upon that Account respecting very little such digrities which had no better Foundation than the  Count  's was something mov'd at these words and m  de him a harsh answer The Gentlemen who were present asked them what they meant  by quarrelling in that Place and being Friends to both Parties presently put a stop to the Quarrel  About the same time Two more Considerable Persons happened to quarrel I mean the Prince of  Conti  and the Chevalier of  Vendome  Grand  Prior  of  France  They were also playing at  Omher  and the Grand  Prior  having call'd  Gano  at the third Lift and gaining  Codille  the Prince of  Conti  told the Person who had made him  Gano  that he was too simple to believe him he being a Man that took his Advantage where he could find it and that he had never seen him play after any other manner The  Grand Prior  took notice of that Word and said it was very reproachful under a dubious sense The Prince of  Conti  took no notice of what he had answered whether he meant to shew himself somewhat wiser than the other or that he thought the Terms he made use of obliged him to make that Answer But after the  Game  was ended the Chevalier of  Vendome  went to  Paris  and returned the next day to  Versailles  with a long Rapier by his Side The  Courtiers  ask'd one another whom he had a Design upon in carrying that Rapier No body dreamt of what had passed the Night before betwixt him and the Prince of  Conti  and the rather because there were hardly Two Persons less capable of counteracting the King's Orders However the  Grand Prior  having posted himself where the Prince was to pass along no sooner saw him than he drew upon him telling him he must needs remember what he had said the Night before and as these things were not to be suffered by People of their Circumstances so he had a mind to see him with Sword in hand The  Grand Prior  meant by these Words to put himself in Competition with him which displeased the Prince exceedingly insomuch that he told him he had forgot himself to speak to him after that manner The Duke of  Bourbon  was coming along in the mean time and the Prince of  Conti  calling him told him that he was equally concerned  with him in the Affair the Chevalier having said that there was no difference betwixt him and the Princes of the  Blood  so he desired to know his Opinion of it and if he thought fit to suffer it The Duke acquainted the Dauphin with it and the Dauphin immediately informed the King Upon which his Majesty gave Orders to  Mr Pontchartrain  to send the  Grand Prior  to the  Bastille  The  Grand Prior  desired to be admitted to the King to acquaint him with his Reasons but his Majesty had no mind to hear him and ordered his  Ʋshers  to shut the Chamber Door against him insomuch that this Prince was at last obliged to obey and went of his own accord to Prison  At that time there was no Governour of the  Bastille  for  Mr de Besma  x  who had been Governour Forty Years at least was dead Six or Seven Months and his Majesty had not yet nam'd any for that Government Not but that there were Persons enough who sollicited for it for the vast Riches which the late Governour had made by it was a sufficient Motive for a great many The Governour of  Pigner  l  being at that time without Employ that Place being given up by the Peace sollicited earnestly for it He had also a great many Competitors for even the Duke of  M  ine  had a mind to it For that Castle being joined to the  Arsenal  he would have been very glad to unite the  Ch  rge  of it to that of Great  Master  of the  Artillery  as it was in the time of the Duke of  S  liy  The  Marquis  of  Sanveri Ʋnder Governour  of the  young Princes  and the late  Governour  s Son in Law had also an Eye upon it but upon Condition that he should not be obliged to reside there and might have a fixt  Sallary  as other Governments had But this was quite contrary to his  Father in law  his Practice who always thought the Advantage he made by the Prisoners more preferable a Thousand times than what the King had given other Governours But whether his Son in Law considered that  these Profits were much sunk by the Peace or that  to keep also the Post he was in he insisted  the same thing The King had a great Inclination  him but was desirous to have the  reside ther  So the Gentleman dropt his Pretensions as soon as he knew his Majesty's Intention  M    Captain of the Guards put also in fo  without doubt had carried it had it depended  the Prisoners to chuse a Governour for themselves He was in effect of a more generous Family  the Gentleman who possessed it last nor did  degenerate from the Virtue of his  he was Nephew to  Mr de Pontchar  in sufficient Circumstances to relieve th  ffect was very charitable ever since  ed into the  Ministry  This Minister  that it was very proper for his Nephew  ho was very sickly and upon that account ready to lay down his Charge not being capable to serve the Two  ast Campaigns and therefore he supported his Pretentions But  Mr Barbesieux  proposed to the  King Mr de Cinqmars  Governour of the  Islands  of St  Honorat  and St  Marguerite  and his  Majesty  seeming to have some inclination for him desired  Barbesieux  to write to him that he might have that Government instead of his own if he inclined to change  St Mars  was very old and having passed his younger Days in the Service of the Prince of  Conde  he had made a prodigious Fortune for he was chosen by the King to guard Mr  Fonq  et  and  Mr Lansun  so that by these means he was become extreamly rich and besides he was far from being covetous as  Mr Besmaux  was Upon that account he return'd answer to the  Marquis  of  Barbesieux  that he had no Inclination to change if his Majesty pleased to continue him where he was But this  Minister  being very desirous to have that Government in the Hands of a Person devoted to his Family as Mr  St Mars  ought  to be because he was obliged to his Father for his Fortune had no mind to be satisfied with this Answer but wrote again to him upon the same Subject setting forth that he neglected his own good Fortune and besides might have the Advantage to be near his Family which he ought to regard as a singular Happiness having been absent from it for many Years Mr  St Mars  was born in the Neighbourhood of  Paris  moreover he was married to Madam  Frenoy  's Sister which had contributed above all to his Establishment This was therefore the way to attack him upon his weak side However it be he took this Letter to be a kind of Command and therefore made Answer that he would obey it As soon as  Mr Saumery  knew this he ask'd that Government of the King which his Majesty granted to him but in a few days after he broke a Company that had been raised on purpose for Mr  Cinqmars  when he guarded Mr  Fouquet  and which he had ever since along with him in the  Islands  of St  Honorat  and St  Marguerite  The Captain had a Sallary of Two Thousand Crowns besides his Profits so that Mr  Saumery  lost all on a sudden the half of the Gratification he thought to receive In the mean time the Chevalier of  Vendome  was come to the  Bastille  whither very few Lords went to see him for fear of displeasing his Majesty who had so resented his Conduct Some were also unwilling to go fearing the Prince of  Conti  's Displeasure and in effect the Prince checked Mr  d' Alegre  for having gone thither Mr  d' Alegre  answered that he did not believe that his Highnes would have took it ill but since he knew his mind he would for the future avoid displeasing him The Prince accepted of his Excuse and the Marshals of  Catinat  and  Tourville  having also gone thither they thought to make the same Apology but the Prince saying nothing to them it passed over in silence  The  Duke  of  Vendome  was at  Anet  when his Brother was commanded to Prison but as soon as he  heard it he took Post to be inform'd by him of the Affair and after he had learn'd it he thought the best way to obtain his Freedom was by the Interest of the same Person who had got him confin'd he therefore went immediately to wait upon the Prince of  Conti  to that purpose And this being all the Satisfaction the Prince demanded he went himself to the  King  to ask the  Grand Prior  's Liberty The King made him answer that if he was satisfied yet himself was not so that Eight or Ten Days were gone before his Majesty would pardon that Prince At last his Majesty was prevailed upon by the Solicitations of the Prince of  Conti  and the Duke of  Vendome  The Duke himself carried the Order for his Liberty and brought him along with him to a certain Place where Four or Five Persons were drunk in solemnizing their Joy for the  Grand Prior  's Liberty  In the mean time the  Marquis  and  Marchionesse  of  Mont  hevreuil  sent also one of their Sons into that Prison not because he intended to fight like the  Grand Prior  but rather upon the account of a Report was spread abroad of his being married at  Rochelle  whither they had sent to apprehend him They resolved to send him to the  American  Islands in order to make him forget his Amours The King was preparing a Fleet to be sent into these Countries and  de Gennes  Captain of a Man of War a man very well known amongst the Sea Officers was to command it It was thought the  Court  designed to seize an Island in those Parts the Inhabitants of which had driven the  Spaniards  from the greatest Part of it insomuch that they were forced to retire to a small Corner of it It was thither that the Father and Mother intended to send their Son in order to do Pennance for his too warm Amours as if Love had been a Capital Crime But this Fleet giving some Occasion of Jealousie to the  English  and  Hollanders  his Majesty was fain to desist though it was already pretty well advanced And that excused the Ch  valier  of  Moutcheuruil  from the Voyage who was made Lieutenant of a Ship and doubtless had quickly been made Captain if his Prudence had been equal to his Courage But he made a very insolent Answer to  Monsieur de Maurepas  when he ask'd him concerning some things he was accus'd of having taken out of one of the Ships which the  Marquis  of  Nesmond  had taken So that his Relations did not judge it convenient to continue him any longer in the  Sea Service  for having once failed in his Respect to Mr  de Maurepas  there was no Probability that he would ever pardon him  The Duke of  Rochefoucaut  after the Marriage of the  Count  of  Ayen  had not only reformed his Table and Reti  ue that were both very magnificent but under some special Pretext retired to  Liancourt  a Place belonging to one of his Sons at Ten or Twelve Leagues distance from  Paris  However having staid weeks there he return'd to Court The King suspected that he was somewhat out of humour at the Match He had Experience enough to know that his Favours conferred to the Pre  udice of another gave as much Jealousie as a Mistriss's Favour to the Prejudice of a Rival yet he took no notice of it to him but he loved his Person and received him as affectionately as he had used to do In the mean time the Duke of  Lerraine  sent  Monsieur de Couvonges  to  Versailles  to demand in his Name  Mademoi  elle  in Marriage The King expected always both before the Peace and since it was made that this Princess should have no other Husband but the King of the  Romans  Nor was there any Princess in  Europe  had more Pretentions to that Happiness than She But the Empress had so very little Inclination for  France  that tho'  Madamoiselle  had been the King's own Daughter instead of being the Duke of  Orleans  's she would have preferred the meanest  Princess  in  Germany  to her But the Queen of  Poland  the Duke of  Lorrain  's Mother when she perceived the Design of the  French  was  extreamly vexed at it in regard of her Son's Interest For being a Princess of extraordinary wit she knew that the situation of that young  Prince's  Estate would oblige him to prefer an Alliance with  France  to any other and therefore she thought of making  Mademoiselle  her Daughter in  Law  However she was willing to have the Emperour's consent to it who insinuated often to her that he would gladly bestow the  Archduchesse  his eldest Daughter upon the  Duke  but the Emperour was prevail'd upon by her Reasons and the  King  accepted of  Monsieur de Couvonges's  offer in the Name of his Master having named  Mr P  ntchartrain  and some other considerable Persons of his Council todraw up the Articles of Marriage which both Parties soon agreed upon However there arose a difficulty that retarded the Affair for some time for the  Duke of Orleans  had no other male Children than the  Duke of Chartres  and that Duke had only Daughters This they had not foreseen in the beginning but the  Court  thought fit to find some expedient for it before they wou'd proceed any further The difficulty consisted mainly in this point that if the  Duke of Chartres  came to die without Male Issue then  Mademoiselle  might have right to divide the succession of the  Dutchess  her Mother with her Brothers Daughters Moreover that succession was very considerable for besides ready Mony Plate and Jewels and a vast quantity of Furniture which she had already inherited by the Death of her Brother the  Elector Palatin  they had also adjudg'd to her Two Hundred Thousand Livers of Rent until they had regulated the share she ought to have in the Succession of that  Elector  But they would have  Mademoiselle  renounce her Succession in case her Brother came to die without Male Issue which  Monsieur de Couvonges  had no mind to do without express Orders The  Duke of Lorraine's Council  found that Clause too severe However this Prince being  still very young and of a very exemplary piety in which he resembled his Mother very much who died soon after the Marriage had been resolved upon he thought that upon all Accounts it was his advantage as indeed it was to have a  Princess  of  France  for a Wife and therefore Sacrificed all other considerations to that policy and consented to renounce all he could pretend to by the Dutchesses Succession in case the  Duke of Chartres  dyed without Heirs upon condition of having Four Hundred Thousand Livers pay'd to him  In this manner the marriage of the  Duke  with  Mademoiselle  was agreed upon and they delay'd only the final conclusion of it till the end of the Camp that was to be made in Honour of the  Duke of Burgundy  They brought thither a great many more Troops than they had at first thought upon which created some mistrust in the Neighbouring  Potentates  They were sensible that the King had filed off a great many Troops to the Frontiers of  Spain  nor were they ignorant of what was commonly reported of his  Catholick Majestie  's health and therefore were affraid that this Camp and all these Troops were designed to make a sudden irruption into his Territories if by chance he came to die which in effect appeared very probable by all the accounts we  ad of him However the King had at last evacu  ted all the places he was to give up by the  Yreaty  of  Ryswick  And as it must needs take up a great deal of time to retake them the  Spaniards  and their  Allies  had always this comfort that they could dispute every Inch of Ground if they came to be attack'd The  King  named  Mareshal de Boufflers  to command this Camp under the  Duke of Burgund  And as the King was very sensible that he was a Person very apt to ruin himself in order to maintain the Dignity which the King confer'd upon him as preferable to all others his Majesty made him a present of Fifty Thousand Crowns before he  marched though the Camp was to continue only Th  e  W  ks so that this Sum appeared pretty rea  onable for so short a time But this  Mareshal  who affected always to be expensive and even in his first employments would fain appear somewhat like  Turenne  in regarding nothing but his Glory and having no manner of value for Mony made such a prodigious expence in that  Camp  that twice so large a Sum hardly excused him He had Five Tables Morning and Evening all equally served the most rare and nice things in the Kingdom were there in abundance nor was there ever seen better or more delicate Chear He had above a Hundred head Cooks besides those who serv'd under them and those who wrought in the Morning took their Rest in the Afternoon he had an infinite Number of Carriages in the Field to bring his Provisions He had two Carriages for Ice only which was brought from  Paris  every Day and had fresh Horses laid always half way for them because it was impossible for the same Horses to bring it all the way without bursting and all his other Carriages he had in the Field were served after the same manner He had  ourveyors not only at  Paris  but also in all the great Towns within Twenty or Five and Twenty Leagues of the Camp every Table had two Stewar  s and the chief Overseer of his Officers was a Person who had served formerly the  Archbishop  of  Paris  for he was perhaps the only Man in the Nation who understood these Affairs best being always obeyed at first Word so that all was done with such an extraordinary sumptuous splendour that it is impossible to describe it right  This Camp ruin'd the Officers intirely who had suffered extreamly before by the expences they were oblieged to be at during the War However not one of them minded any thing but how to  please the King neither more nor less than if he had been a Deity there was never any thing to be seen so splendid and magnificent as all  Officers from the highest to the lowest All the Troops and Foot Souldiers were new Cloathed and that cost some Regiments above Five and Twenty Thousand Crowns But while they impoverished themselves  Paris  was enrich'd by it for  Twenty Days before the Camp was form'd there was nothing to be seen at the Merchants Doors but large Bales which were carried away every moment It is altogether impossible to tell how much Provisions were carried from that  to that Camp and in all probability it had been sufficient to have starved the City if the Merchants had not been very provident before Hand and as Strangers are always curious there was not hardly one of them who went not to see the Camp opportunities of that Nature falling out but very seldom so that prope  ly speaking it was only one continued  Procession  from  Paris  to  Compiegne  where it was impossible to find Lodging for Mony and all  Innkeepers  were expresly forbid to receive any body whether they meant to save their Lodgings for the People of the Court or that they had no mind to  that Town with a number of unknown People and by that means prevent all dangerous accidents  the  the Camp was to continue being quite  the King returned to  Versailles  with all the Court having first bestowed considerable Largesses upon all the Troops The great Magnificence that appeared here undeceived the Strangers of the Opinion they had brought with them from their own Country to wit that  France  had been exhausted both of Men and Mony They had already seen the contrary at the  Duke of Burgundy  's Marriage by the great confluence of People they found at  Paris  But what they had seen upon this occasion having quite disabused them they  began to look upon the King as another  Croesus  whose Riches were inexhaustible  But if this Prince was so Rich as there was no reason to doubt of it his People were in extream Poverty insomuch that they wanted a great many things to supply their Necessities But as soon as the King had made the Peace he thought of contributing to their ease He made divers Edicts in favour of the Country People whose Lands were altogether waste for want of means to cultivate 'em He also provided by an Act of Council that there shou'd be no order to sell the Lands of those who carried Arms the preceeding Years He allow'd them some time for the payment of their Debts But all this being only Paper 'twas impossible for any body to relieve their Necessity without Money And a great many People thought that it had been of far greater advantage to the Kingdom if His Majesty instead of spending his Money so lavishly upon that Camp had delt it amongst his People in order to buy them Cattle All the Country was quite out of Cattel and by lending the People some Money whereby they might furnish themselves with some he had restor'd a great many to Life who were ready to Perish upon the want they had suffer'd for a long time Not but that the King had reliev'd his People in some manner in taking off the Capitation He had also sunk a great many other Taxes which were rais'd during the War But the Subsidies were agumented by a third besides the Corn that had continued dear for a long time became daily dearer which occasioned new Desolation in a great many Families And the poor Gentry was most of all to be pitied especially those who had Children for after the Peace they knew not how to bestow them because by the reform which was made of the Troops they sent home all the Lieutenants as useless Members  Nor did they continue the Pay of a reform to any but to Captains and Lieutenants who had serv'd at least Ten Years insomuch that those who serv'd under that Time were in the most deplorable Condition imaginable  The Marquis of  Dangeau  great Master of the Order of St  Lazarus  made at that time an Establishment that evinc'd sufficiently how much Good he would have done if it had been in his Power He had establish'd  Companies  of  Cadets  that had been very useful for poor Gentlemen as well as for those they received amongst them For tho' these  Companies  had been instituted in all appearance only in consideration of them yet of late they have received all sorts of People even such p  rsons as cou'd have no other Communication with them but with regard to the Liveries they had carried formerly In effect you might have seen FootBoys amongst them and many others who were so far from being the Children of Fathers who liv'd Nobly who only ought to be admitted there that they were only of the  um of the People But it was not with regard to that alone that Affairs took another turn some while ago in the Kingdom The World was asto  h'd to  that the same  Nobility  who were formerly reputed the support of the  State  was now  in  o so great Contempt under the Ministry of the Ma  quis of  Louvois  that very odious Li  s were p  sted up against them They were  with the greatest indignity imaginable  forsooth that one Man who had  Nobility of  Anjou  tho' he was rather  up his Liquor than to command them  himself to be surprized And thus made them answerable for his Fault insomuch  there was nothing to be seen but Libels posted up in every Corner against them as if the Ig  r  n  of one Commander was sufficent to  make as many Criminals as there were Gentlemen and ever since they were oblig'd to mixthemselves amongst the Burgesses to go upon the  Arier Ban  And besides serving upon their own Expences according to the ordinary Custom they had the additional mortification to serve amongst a  Scum  that was unworthy to have any room in their Company However the Marquis of  Dangeau  who had not always been very rich and consequently knew what satisfaction 'twas for a Man of Quality who was not in circumstances to educate his Children according to their ranks to have them otherwise provided for resolv'd to establish a fond out of a certain share of the Revenues of the GrandMastership for the Education of some Children of Quality He propos'd the Thing to the King and His Majesty left the disposal of it to his own choice upon which he took eight Children out of the principal Families of the Kingdom  viz  of the House of  Montmorency  of the House of  Crequi  of the House of  Ailly  of  Maille  c He hir'd a House for them near  Charonne  and gave them Masters of all sorts with Boys to serve them The Abbot of  Dangeau  his Brother being willing to contribute to so excellent an Institution took upon himself the charge of overseeing them There was non more capable of the Employ he being very learned and it was long of himself that the King had not conferr'd a  Bishoprick  and considerable Abbeys upon him but His Majesty knowing he lov'd his pleasure too much he thought it sufficient to secure him from Starving  About that time the Duke of  Chaulnes  fell Sick and languish'd some time before he Died He possess'd a great many considerable Employments both within and without the Kingdom and by these means made himself both Friends and Enemies  A certain Gentleman who had always appeared to be of the number of the last thought it now his Duty to endeavour a reconciliation with him before he expir'd I mean the Cardinal  D'Estrees  who was at  Rome  while the Duke was  Ambassador Extraordinary  at that Court from the King The Cardinal was reputed a Man of Parts and upon that account was ambitious to have the preference over all which was the cause of their difference But the Respect shown to the Duke at the Court of  Rome  gave him some Ombrage So that their misunderstanding was no secret any any where and no consideration oblig'd the Cardinal to observe any measures in it However whether he thought himself in the wrong or that he had a mind to appear a good Christian he came at that time to ask his Pardon The Duke was extreamly surpriz'd when they told him the Cardinal was come to wait on him it was no more seasonable for him to think upon any Resentment tho' perhaps he had been very capable of it at another time therefore he desir'd he might come in and there they were reconcil'd to one another In a few days after the Duke Died and left the Chancellor his Testamentary Executor The D  ceas'd had Married the Widow of the Marquis of St  Maigrin  Lieutenant of the LightHorse They had been Married a long time without having any Issue so that in order to make his  urt the better to Monsieur  Colbert  when he Married his Eldest Daughter to the Duke of  Che    his Cousin  German  he instituted the  shou'd be begotten of that Marriage for  s Her He only reserv'd for himself the  undred thousand Livers of which he l  t twenty thousand Crowns to the Chancell  and the rest to some of his Domesticks At the time o  his Death he was Governor of    He had formerly been Governor of  Brittany  But this last government was thought very proper for the Count of  Thoulouse  the King's Natural Son therefore His Majesty got him to resign it in his favour and the King gave him  that  of  Guyenne  in exchange  The Government of  Guyenne  was not long vacant after his Death which fell out very conveniently for the Duke of  Chartres  to whom the King had promis'd it when that Duke Married the Count of  Thoulouse  's Sister The King had given the survivance of it to the Duke of  Chevreuse  but that Duke had already a hundred Thousand Livers in Rent and besides the Duke of  Chaulnes  his Lands produc'd no less so that all of a sudden two hundred Thousand Livers a Year fell into the Family So that he was already become so Rich that  that  Government wou'd prove rather superfluous than useful to him But Quietist as he was he lov'd Riches nothing the less However I believe they did wrong him in Reputing him a Sect  rian At last he made so much Interest to have the Survivance of that Government that it was easie to perceive  Molinos  's suspected Disciples are not indifferent of Matters Yet be how it will the Archbishop of  Cambray  was nothing like him He suffer'd his Exile very peaceably and without making the least noise bore the Imprisonment of his good Friend Madam  Guyon  She was brought from the Convent about  Easter  time in order to be sent to the  Bastille  where she was left for four or five Months to examine her Conscience and then she was interrogated tho' 'tis impossible to know upon what for that sort of things are always very secret But according to what one can judge it was upon some things contain'd in a Book Publish'd by the Archbishop of  Meaux  against the Archbishop of  Cambray  in which she was made mention of That Book contain'd very extraodinary matters against  her It charg'd her with a great many Revelations and Miracles in a word it endeavour'd by rendring her ridiculous to make the Blow fall upon the Archbishop of  Cambray  her good Friend However the Bishop of  Meaux  his principal Adversary could not obtain his being declar'd a  Heretick  pursuant to his Allegations The Court of  Rome  whose business 'tis to give Sentence upon that Head was very reserv'd upon the Point whether it was that they saw no occasion for such a Declaration or that by drilling on the Affair they thought to appear more mysterious The Court espous'd the Bishop of  Meaux  's Interest very much and after having remov'd the Archbishop of  Cambray  from the Duke of  Burgundy  's Presence did likewise remove his Nephew that Prince's Subpreceptor together with some other Persons who were suspected of adhering to his Sentiments Two of his waiting Gentlemen were among the number of those who were disgraced tho' the occasion of it might seem foreign enough to their Profession In fine to cut off all hopes of ever returning to be about his Person others were put in their places who perhaps are no better Men than they For we must know that those who were remov'd were Persons of exemplary Piety insomuch that all the Kingdom over there were none to be found that liv'd a more Christian Life However their Enemies employ'd all their art to ruin them whether it was that they really thought them tainted with that Doctrine or that they only cover'd their private views with that Pretence So it was that new Faces started up all of a sudden about the Young Prince This was not at all agreeable to the Prince at least it seemed so The Bishop of  Cambray  who wrote from time to time to the Pope according as the divers Charges were laid against him having at that time sent His Holiness a Letter which was mightily cried up the young Prince declar'd openly  that he would be glad to see it But besides that there were but very few Copies of it to be seen in the Kingdom grievous Punishments being inflicted upon those who dispersed them nobody durst offer to satisfie his Desire for fear of displeasing the King From thence the A B of  Cambray  's Friends took occasion to censure his Enemies They Publish'd that it was always allowable for any Man to make his Defences and their offering in this manner to hinder them spoke their unjustice The vulgar People who commonly take upon them to decide every thing tho' without forming any Judgment of the Affair presently applauded these Complaints without considering that in Religious Matters there are some things better conceal'd than known that Heresies are sooner propagated by Reading than by Conversation so that all Writings tho' never so little suspected cannot be too cautiously prohibited But notwithstanding all the prohibitions against the bringing in of these Letters two Bags were brought not only into the Kingdom but even into the Gates of  Paris  Monsieur  D'Argenson  smelt the Matter and understood that they were brought into Town in Coaches And in effect two HackneyCoaches were sent to take them up at the Houses where they were Lodg'd without knowing what they were But before they enter'd the Town care was taken to examin them and as soon as Monsieur  D'Argenson  found what they were he Burnt them one after another in his Closet But after all such was the Curiosity of some That tho' every one detested Quietism as it was represented by the Bishop of  Cambray  's Enemies yet all that cou'd escape that Marshal's View were sold at four  Louis d'Ors  the Piece  The Duke  D'Estrees  Governor of the Isle of  France  follow'd Monsieur  D'Chaulnes  very speedily tho' there was a great deal of difference between their Ages the one being but fifty Years  Old and the other Seventy The D of  D' Estrees  Died after being cut of the Stone and the fault was not so much laid upon the Chirurgeon as upon an Accident that he cou'd not foresee He had delay'd the performing of the Operation till the great heat was over But the heat returning unexpectedly with much Thunder his Wound which had formerly been in a good Condition gave over Suppurating and so he tip'd off in a minute He left the Affairs of his Family in great Disorder His Son had Married for his first Wife the Daughter of Monsieur  de Lionne  Secretary of State by whom he had a Son and some Daughters and for his second a Daughter of the Marquis  de Vaubrun  Lieutenant of the King's Armies This last did not know where to recover her  Dowry  and by consequence had been at a loss where to secure her  Joynture  if the Bishop of  Laon  her Husband's Brother had not engag'd in the Contract of Marriage for two hundred thousand Livers to the Children that he shou'd have by her The King to whom the Duke had recommended his Family before he was cut gave his Government to his Eldest Son the other depended solely upon his Succession to his Mother who cou'd not but be very Rich tho she had lost something by her Husband For her Mother was still alive as well as her Mother's Father who was worth two Millions of Money Now he having only two Heiresses namely the Marchioness of  Ma  levrier  and her self the half of it was one day to be he  s It is true the Dutchess had a Brother who pursuant to the preference of Males was intitled to the better half of the Succession but  e being set apart for the Church by reason of his D  cripitness and being already possess'd of Benefices s  reckon'd that he ought never to Marry And i  there was no great appearance or it tho' we every day meet with things more extraordinary than that But the Thing that  troubled her most was That he lov'd Mony so that tho he did not Marry it was to be fear'd he might not grant her his share of his Grandfather's Estate He had but lately given a signal instance of his Love for Money by maintaining a LawSuit for a small Living that he had procur'd from him whose natural right it was to grant it The Dean of  Nants  possess'd it formerly and he having resign'd it to one of his Friends Abbot  Vaubrun  pretended that his Resignation cou'd not be vali'd for that he had not liv'd upon it a competent space of time for being admitted in the Court of  Rome  However the contrary seem'd to appear by the Will of the Deceased but he affirm'd that to be a Fraud and said that the Cura  e was Cheated In the mean time he had a Permission to raise monitory Letters in order to find a Discovery by those that had assisted to keep the Body a long time after his Death that they might favour his Party However fearing lest those who were concern'd might be pretty nimble he obtain'd a Decree in Justice that the Body should be uninterr'd pretending that by viewing it it were easie to discover the Cheat The Judges granted him his Demand and so the poor Body was pull'd out of the Coffin half Rotten In fine tho' it cast a very nauseous Smell so that it was impossible to approach it by a hundred paces yet he caus'd it to be view'd by the Physicians and Chirurgeons in order to have their Opinion of it He put 'em upon an odd sort of Business but thinking they were very well accustom'd to these sort of Perfumes he did not regard it so much The Physicians and Chirurgeons turn'd over and over the Dead Body and having given a doubtful account of it it was inter'd again in a more stinking Condition than it had been when it was taken up The Abbot  Vaubrun  seeing that by their Judgment he was like to be Cast and condemned to pay the Charges obtain'd another Judgment that  the same Body might be view'd by other more skilful Persons And thus it was taken up a second time and these skilful Gentlemen having been more favourable to him than the former he in the end gain'd the Suit  In the mean time the Abbot of  Rochefoucaut  coming to die the Abbot  Verthuel  his Brother ask'd two good Abbies which he had possessed but His Majesty refus'd him However having always a great esteem for the Duke of  Rochefoucaut  Brother to the two Abbots though he had absented from coming to Court for six Weeks after the Count of  Ayen  's Marriage he condescended to give him a Reason for that refusal because as His Majesty alledg'd He had not found the Abbot  Vertheuel  's Conduct regular enough to oblige him to bestow upon him Goods of the Church which perhaps he might employ to an other use than they were design'd for His Majesty added that to shew that he was very willing to oblige him when it did not interfere with his Conscience he restor'd the Abbies possessed by the Deceased upon the Old Abbot  de la Rochefoucaut  his Uncle The Old Abbot dream'd nothing of such a Windfall He had retir'd into his own Country a long while before without thinking of ever returning to Court But Fortune pursuing him as far as his Retreat his only care then was to return Thanks to His Majesty and to send to  Rome  for his Bulls  The Princess of  Epinois  and the Dutchess of  Richelieu  died soon after the one three days after the other The former Died in less than an Hours Sickness the latter had been long troubled with a tedious Distemper The Princess  d'Epinois  was walking out of the Marquis of  Barbesieux  his House when she was seiz'd of a sudden with a violent Pain Presently she stop'd and took hold of a Windowshutter to keep her from falling But in that minute she lost her Senses and being carried  Home Died in the space of a Quarter of an Hour She was one of the greatest players at  Lansquenette  at  Marli  and many imputed this Accident to her considerable losses which hadmade so great an alteration in her Blood that it had been a Miracle if some troublesome thing or other had not come upon her Mr  Pelletier  Intendant of the Finances to whom 'tis said she was Married in the way of Conscience was mightily afflicted at her Death However that did not keep him from going to  Versailles  to Council The first time he appear'd every body condol'd his Loss because all the World knew how far he was concern'd nay the King himself knew it and one time when the Princess had lost a great Summ at  Marli  and pay'd it next day to the great surprizal of a great many who thought she was not in a Condition to raise it so soon His Majesty did not stand to ask Mr  Pelletier  if 'twas not he that had lent it her Upon that Mr  Pelletier  own'd that she had  had  recourse to him to save her Honour I know not whether His Majesty did not carry his Curiosity further and ask'd him if he was not Married to her That being above my Knowledge I shall know nothing of it for fear of incurring the imputation of a Lye That Lady had two Sons and two Daughters by her Husband The Daughters were still Unmarried 'Twas the Eldest of 'em that the Princess of  Conty  the King's Daughter would have married to the Marquis  de Valliere  As for the Sons the Younger Died a Natural Death and the Elder had married a Daughter of the Prince  de la Isle Bonne  of the House of  Lorain  The Dutchess of  Richelieu  left behind her a Son and some Daughters The Birth of that Son had extinguish'd all the hopes of the Marquis of  Richlieu  the Duke's Nephew who was intitled to the Succession in case of no Male Issue He being a little upon the fret and nothing being more capable  to disturb one's Conduct than Poverty his Wife and he did not agree very well notwithstanding he had run away with her and she deserv'd a more honourable Usage In fine whether this misunderstanding increas'd every day or that his Poverty oblig'd him to avoid the Charges that attend People of their Quality they parted in the beginning of the Year and she went to  England  to her Mother but it being impossible that so pretty a Creature as she shou'd not have many Admirers her Husband was quickly sensible that in striving to be rid of one evil he had brought another upon himself that was equally unsupportable He was seiz'd with a deep jealousie and being upon that score restless both Night and Day he set all Springs at Work to oblige his Lady to return out of that Country She thinking she could not be better than with her Mother would not listen to any Proposal he could make A Wife seldom gives ear to the Voice of a Husband at a distance especially a Husband that gives her no relief in time of need So he was oblig'd to fall upon other measures In the mean time the Duke of  Orleans  's Daughter was Married to the Duke of  Lorain  by way of Proxy The King sent the Young Princess some Presents upon which she left the Court immediately and after staying but hours as  Paris  set out immediately to  Bar  pursuant to the Duke the Bridegroom's orders who was to meet her there The Castle of  Bar  was fitted up for her Reception When the Duke went to his Estate he found all his Houses out of order for the King's Intendants in that Country had minded themselves more than any thing else and had scarce taken care to make the necessary Reparations The Duke did not go at first to  Nancy  because the King's Troops were there demolishing the Fortifications So he stop'd four or five Leagues on the other side of it whither he who Commanded the King's Troops sent him  a Captain with some Soldiers for his Guard But that Prince refus'd 'em thinking it more convenient to imploy the Militia of his Country Accordingly the Inhabitants of  Nancy  and the other Towns provided some Companies of Horse and Foot till such time as his regular Troops should be in readiness for which he had given out Commissions In fine the Duke came to his capital City when the King's Troops march'd out As soon as the Duke heard the News that the young Princess was upon her Journey to  Lorrain  he came to  Bar  and in the mean time the Inhabitants of  Nancy  made preparations for her Entry in proportion to their Ability For besides the oppression they had lain under for the fifty or sixty Years that their Country was cover'd with forreign Troops they began to feel the terrible effects of a Famine which was general not only over that Country but all the adjacent States so that their Neighbours were almost in the same Condition In some places indeed the Season seem'd to promise Plenty but when they came to thresh the Corn it did not yield the half of what it us'd to do Nay  France  it self which us'd to furnish others with Corn was first sensible of the want of it and such Disorders happen'd upon the marching of the Troops that the Judges of the  Police  were oblig'd to defend the Bakers with the strong hand for the Poor People were like to fall upon 'em and Rob 'em so great was their Misery In the Streets of  Paris  there was nothing to be seen but Troops of Beggars which were yet more numerous in the Country Mr  d' Argenson  was so watchful in the City that they durst not harass the People there as they did elsewhere Tho' after all some of these hungry wretches pay'd a visit to the Bakers that were coming from  Gonnesse  and one of 'em gave a Baker a Wound with his Knife because he would not sell his Bread at what price he pleas'd  As every body thinks of nothing but getting so this Dearth put a great many Usurers upon raising the price of Bread yet higher It being reported that the Farmers General were the People that laid up Magazines of Corn in order to make up the Loss they had sustain'd upon the Taxes for that the Wine was quite lost that Year the first President gave 'em to know that if it was true they not only run the risque of being pillag'd but ruin'd to boot for he was a Man that would not pardon such things and the Interest of the State and Country was sufficient to draw such Threats from him in good earnest Tho' this was a sufficient cause of Fear to those who were conscious of their own Guilt yet some were so covetous that they would venture all rather than miss such an opportunity of getting Money There was one  Miotte  that had Farm'd the Estate of  Meudon  from the D of  Orleans  and upon that score thought himself proof against any thing that might happen This Man bought up Corn every where and made vast Magazines in the Castle of  Montereau Fautyonne  Mr  D'Argenson  and the chief President being inform'd of it the former took him up and the latter passed a Decree against him insomuch that if he had not found Friends to disswade the President from seizing upon his Person he had gone near to have been Hang'd But the Court it self inspected the matter and it being try'd before the Council he was clear'd for a Fine of Livers and the confiscation of some part of the Corn Some other Usurers had much the same usage for the Judges could not deal more severely with them without making it known that  Miotte  's Friends were the occasion of the Favour shewn him However Mr  d'Argenson  concerted measures for preventing the like for the future and sent Commissaries with Persons that he could confide in all over the Country for there was no doing of it without ranging the Country  The misery of the People fill'd both  Paris  and the Country with Robbers and the Inhabitants were scarce safe in their Houses They durst not stir abroad nor travel either early or late because the poor Wretches were so desperate as to be capable of any thing but Mr  d'Argenson  took the Alarm upon this as well as all other disorders while Mr  de la Reinie  his Predecessor minded nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of the Fruit of his Labours He had but a Son and a Daughter with a vast Estate for being all a long very cunning he had laid up an infinity of money He was somewhat dissatisfied with his Son who had been at  Rome  a long while and minded nothing but the Pictures and other Curiosities of the City without regarding his Father's Example who had rais'd himself to the highest Post of the Law tho' he begun with the Lowest So that Magistrate careing only for his Daughter resolv'd to marry her as honourable as he could There was enough that offer'd to be Suitors but one  Machaut  a Master of Requests carried his Suit so far that after some Dispute Articles were mutually sign'd After that the Lover came to pay his Respects to his Mistress whom he had never seen But she being not Handsome he lik'd her so ill that he told her Father That the only way to make him miserable was to oblige him to finish what he had begun Her Father was a little nettled at the Compliment however he indeavoured to get off as honourably as he could He did not ask him the cause of the Breach but suspecting what it was he agreed to what he desir'd because he would not give his Daughter to a Man that did not Love her  The D of  Loraine  having stay'd some days at  Bar  with his Spouse carry'd her to  Nancy  where she met with some Magnificence notwithstanding the publick Calamity but being bred up at the proudest Court in the World she minded that far less than the Love of that People for their Sovereign They shewed it in all their Actions and what animated 'em very much was the exemplary Piety of that Young Prince who upon that score might be call'd the Prodigy of the Age He would see neither Play nor Opera nor allow of 'em about his Court He look'd upon those Diversions not only as unworthy of a Christian but contrary to the Duty of so Holy a Profession He was the Son of a Father and Mother that in their time were patterns of Vertue and 'twas plain that he indeavour'd to make the best use of the Lessons they had given him The Bishop of  Osnabrug  the Duke's Brother arriv'd at that time at the Court of  Lorrain  upon his return from his Bishoprick which he had obtain'd about five or six months before by the recommend  t on of the Emperour his Uncle He is a handsome Prince and one that knows his Perfections very well A Brother of the Elector of  Hannover  's was formerly possess'd of that Bishoprick which pursuant to the Treaty of  Munster  ought to be fill'd by a Protestant and a  Roman  Catholick by turns  As soon as the D of  Lorrain  had taken Possession of his Countries he gave advice of it to all the Princes of  Europe  pur  uant to the usual Custom He likewise notified his Marriage in the same manner And in the mean time indeavour'd by his good Conduct to repair the Disorders that the War had occasion'd in so long a space of time  In the mean time the P of  Con  y  gain'  s Suit before the High Court of Parliament as well as before the Court of Requests This solac'd him entirely upon the loss of the Crown    oland  tho' there was a great deal of difference between the one and the other The New K of  Poland  did not  his Crown in Tranquillity Some of his Subjects charging him with a great many things were so bold as to send a fresh Message to  Versailles  praying the King to assist 'em with Men and Money for the recovery of their Liberty which as they alledg'd was overrun by his Usurpation They accus'd him of Sacrificing the Nation to his private Interests But His Majesty would not meddle in the matter  The Emperor as well as the D of  Lo  rain  had form'd a design to procure repose to his People as soon as possibly he could This he could not effect without making Peace with the  Turks  which at last he consented to tho' they were sensible they were upon the brink of Ruin He accepted the Mediation of the K of  England  and the States General and the  Turks  having done the same an Interview was agreed upon at  Carlowitz  in order to adjust the Difference between the two Emperors In the mean time he gave notice of all to his Allies to the end that they having joyntly carried on so successful a War might mutually concur in procuring a Peace equally advantageous to the one as well as to the other  At that time the K of  England  went to  Germany  in order to come nearer the place where the Conferences were held He stoped at the Court of  Hannover  which occasion'd as much uneasiness to  France  as  France  occasion'd to the Allies by the Camp they had form'd In the mean time Ambassadors repair'd from all quarter to  Carlowitz  His  Britannick  Majesty desir'd this Peace very passionately in order to give some jealousie to  France  and to see the Emperor's growing Power at a stand For he wish'd rather that the Emperor should stand in need of his help than he of the Emperor's But the Year was over before that great Work was concluded as well as before the K of the  Romans  his Marriage with the Princess of  Hannover  was compleated 'Tis true that Marriage was concluded upon above two months before but the young Princess being th  n in  Italy  along with her Mother who was gone to see the Dutchess of  Modena  her Eldest Daughter it was put off till the beginning of the Year To conclude 'tis not doubted but these two things will quickly be adjusted which Time will  ew to all who have the happiness to live so  ng  FINIS  AN INDEX
