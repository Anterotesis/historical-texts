 Modern Times OR THE ADVENTURES OF GABRIEL OUTCAST SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF▪ IN IMITATION OF GIL BLAS  QUI CAPIT ILLE FACIT  Prov  IN THREE VOLUMES VOLUME I  LONDON  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY THE LITERARY SOCIETY At the  LOGOGRAPHIC PRESS  AND SOLD BY J WALTER PRINTINGHOUSESQUARE BLACKFRYARS  MDCCLXXXV  ADVERTISEMENT  IT may be necessary in this age of slander and detraction for the writer of the following novel to declare that in the characters here drawn he has pointed at no particular person his view being merely to lay before the rising generation the arts and de∣ceptions of the generality of  mankind He is very sensible that there are in all classes of life men of honour and res∣pectability but it must be al∣lowed at the same time that there are not wanting men of the reverse disposition It is a matter of lamentation that there are too many of them in the world and by exposing them to the eye of the incautious the author flatters himself he is do∣ing as laudable an act as point∣ing out to the unwary a pit art∣fully concealed to entrap them  SOME readers may possibly be acquainted with one anecdote and some with another here told they being facts of noto∣riety be that as it may it they serve to elucidate or give a co∣louring to the subject they are upon there can be no more im∣propriety in introducing them than in repeating a good and well timed story in a large com∣pany because some men in that company may have heard it be∣fore  BEFORE the reviewers think proper to pass their opinion up∣on these volumes they are de∣sired attentively to read the twentieth chaper  MODERN TIMES  CHAPTER I  FROM an opinion that a reci∣tal of my adventures through life may be useful to society I have been induced to give them to the world and flatter myself that if they have not a tendency to make men philosophers they at least will teach them worldly knowledge  and shew them that he is the rich∣est and happiest of mortals whose resources are within himself and who depends least upon the assist∣ance of others  WHO my parents were is in∣deed very immaterial but it may be necessary to say that I am the only child of a very respectable though not very opulent couple My father's name was Wilbraham he was descended from the younger branch of a good family and though his estate in the county of Notting∣ham did not exceed one hundred pounds a year pride of blood pre∣vented his putting me out to any  trade but made him ambitious of bringing me up as he called it a  Gentleman  One hundred a year was a scanty pittance to encourage such notions but he lived as half the world does upon expectation looked forward to the death of an uncle mortgaged his little patri∣mony to keep up appearances and died as the common phrase is some hundreds of pounds worse than no∣thing The only advantage I re∣ceived from him was a tolerable e∣ducation acquired at a grammarschool in the neighbourhood As he could not afford me a horse nor any of those rural indulgencies which young gentlemen are taught  to expect I was under the necessi∣ty of seeking my amusement at home and I have blessed myself since a thousand times in that ne∣cessity Being fond of study I be∣came master of the Classicks and the vicar of the parish who profess∣ed to have my interest much at heart furnished me with the loan of such books as he thought would improve my mind and which our circulating library did not possess By the time I was nineteen I be∣came through these means a tole∣rable proficient in history and the  belles lettres  and was thought to be a pretty good scholar nor did I want the outward accomplishments  of a gentleman My father took care I should learn to dance and the fencingmaster who attended at the school where I was bred find∣ing me as he was pleased to say an active wellmade young man gave me voluntarily a sufficient number of lessons on the small sword to en∣able me to defend myself was I ever attacked in that way This added to a natural gaiety of temper led me into the good graces of ma∣ny and had he left me his little e∣state unincumbered I should have passed through life without any dif∣ficulty As it is few men have ex∣perienced a greater vicissitude of for∣tune or more embarrassments My  father caught the small pox and my mother who loved him too tenderly to quit the house though she had never had that disorder im∣prudently busied herself about him caught the infection and I was thus deprived of both my parents at once she fell a sacrifice to the distemper a few days after my fa∣ther and they were both buried in the same grave  WITH the assistance of my good friend the vicar I soon looked round me and found I had nothing to depend on but myself the mort∣gagees seized the estate which ow∣ing to the decrease in value of land  was barely sufficient to pay the mo∣ney borrowed and the cash into which his furniture and other things were converted was divided among his creditors and did not pay more than twelve shillings in the pound so that had not the vi∣car felt for my situation I should not have known how to have acted Application was made to my fa∣ther's uncle but to no manner of purpose His answer was  I had been brought up a  Gentleman  and he should  now  see how I could make out upon the profession he had never been consulted up∣on my education and was deter∣mined not to give me a shilling  I might apply to my mother's relations who by the by were not in a situation to assist me  he  desired never to hear any thing of me  In short had it not been for the humanity of the vicar who procured me a collection of fifty pounds among the neighbour∣ing gentry and who took me into his house till my father's affairs were adjusted I might have been turned out into the street a vagrant To him I am indebted for the first good office I experienced and I am sure it was disinterestedThe God of Compassion taught him mercy and he practised it where he could  THE next step the vicar took was to find a situation to place me in He had a brother who kept a school in the neighbourhood of London to him he applied and prevailed on him to take me in as an assistant Part of my money was expended in equiping me with ne∣cessaries and on the eve of my de∣parture which was soon after on counting my wealth I found my∣self possessed of three ten pound bank notes and five pounds fifteen shillings in cash more money than I ever was master of and of which I simply thought I never should see the end My good friend advised me to husband it to the utmost and  with this view I took a place to London on the roof of the coach but that no future situation of mine might hurt the pride of my father's family I changed my name and called myself  Gabriel Outcast  CHAP II  THE first day's journey passed to∣lerably well It was fine wea∣ther and I had a companion on the roof an itinerant pedlar The pas∣sengers within were a footman and two maid servants of a Nottingham∣shire Baronet an outrider to a trades∣man in London and a smuggler so that in point of company I thought  myself as happy without as I should have been within The only know∣ledge I could gather from the ped∣lar was some part of the mysteries of his profession he took a great deal of pains to persuade me he was a rascal such as that under a tra∣velling licence and the idea of sel∣ling things cheap the articles he dealt in were of the worst kind and generally damaged for which he got the best price and very often sold goods to the ignorant and un∣wary thirty per cent dearer than they could be bought for of the fair dealer However I had nothing to do with him as I did not set up for a corrector of other men's con∣duct  I left him in the enjoyment of his iniquity and we passed through the day as sociable as beg∣gars generally are for I determined on my first outset to bring my mind if possible to a conformity with the humility of any situation I might be thrown into But not∣withstanding my philosophy I found myself rather hurt at the close of the day Though riding on the roof of the coach I considered myself from family from education from pro∣perty much superior to those with∣in but  my  thinking so did not lead the landlord of the inn where we were to sleep and his wife to think the same I found a manifest  difference between riding  without  and riding  within  The pedlar ac∣customed to such travelling took his place instantly on alighting in the corner of the kitchen chimney but on my engaging the attention of the chambermaid to whom I addressed myself very civilly she was soon routed by her mistress with a  I wish to God Betty you'd leave that fellow and attend to the in∣side passengers  It was in vain for me to plead a headache and a wish to be shewn to my chamber She told me that she had no beds but for the gentlemen and ladies that came in the coach and that I must turn into the loft or the stable  In vain did Betty argue in my fa∣vour in vain did she say that I and the  gentleman  in the chimneycorner meaning the pedlar might lay to∣gether in the spare garret nothing would do till I pulled out my purse and asked her to change me a ten pound note for one of the notes I had lodged in my purse the others were safe stowed in my trunk The naming of a ten pound note altered her tone she  begged my pardon for not being able to attend to me in the hurry she was in but that if I could dispense with lay∣ing at the top of the house with my fellowtraveller the bed was a good one and it should be clean  sheeted  I was too fatigued and too much shaken with my jour∣ney to be very nice about my lodging I could have slept upon the boards I told her  I would get something warm to drink settle the matter with my fellowtraveller and when the chamber∣maid had waited on the coach  gentry  I would be shewn to my room  Finding the benefit I de∣rived from the naming a bank note I began again to display my wealth in order to get consequence at the firesideand I discovered that it not only procured me the warmest place but the attention of the whole kitchen A butcher in the further  corner observed to me that  he had known  gem'men  ride upon the roof of the coach through choice for his part he never rode any where else it was pleasanter and he could  nater  the country  In short after a few ceremonies a∣bout place were adjusted and a few coals laid on we presently became acquainted and the state of the na∣tion was debated on The butcher said  the minister was a man of his own  kidney  that he handled a  knife  well and got to the bot∣tom of a  wound  at once did not stand niggling as some of our statesmen do but when he  cut  cut at a single stroke and chopped  off every unnecessary part of the constitution at a blow  Yes yes  says an exciseman who sat opposite to him  he  does  cut with a vengeance I am sure I have reason to say so for he has cut  me  out of a vote for the county and now in all proba∣bility I may lose my place  And no harm  replies the but∣cher  if you was D me it would be happy for this country if there wasn't an exciseman in it We should then have our beer at half price  "Yes by Gd" re∣turns the exciseman  rogues would be then triumphant  Finding the conversation grow warm I con∣sulted  the pedlar and we retired to our chamber we paid our reckon∣ing however first for the land∣lady told us it was customary for all outside passengers to pay for their beds before they slept in them as it saved a world of trouble in the morning and it was lucky for me that this custom was complied with for my display of my money at the fireside had so fascinated the atten∣tion of the pedlar that he thought proper to rise an hour before the coach set off and make free with my purse and its contents which laid in my breeches pocket on the chair beside me but which from the sound sleep I was in I was insensi∣ble  of his taking All I know is that having paid my reckoning the night before I had no occasion for money in the morning and never missed it till I wanted to pay for my breakfast and that the pedlar had taken it was beyond a doubt as he was seen to leave the inn with his wallet before the coachman was vi∣sible and had not though he had taken his place for London paid any part of his fare As we are apt to make the best of misfortunes like the philosopher who having broke his leg rejoiced that it was not his neck I consoled myself in not having lost my trunk that hav∣ing been commited to the care of  the coachman in which the remain∣der of my money was stowed and of which I determined to be more careful  WE had now no one on the out∣side but the coachman and myself whom I addressed in his own way and whom a glass of brandy or gin at every village where he stopped had made very eloquent and com∣municative  This will be a dmned poor journey for me  says he  nobody without and none but beggars within  for I found his attention was always engrossed with what he should get upon the road I asked him if he  was not paid by his master  Yes by Gd  says he  after a man∣nertwelve shillings a week which will scarce find me in gin and tobacco If it was not now and then for a generous passen∣ger we coachmen might starve 'Tis true we get a shilling or two occasionally by a short passen∣ger or for the carriage of a par∣cel that is not booked but that's a poor pittance in these hard times  On my observing to him that these occasional shillings were in my opinion the property of his master "Are they by Gd" says he  then the devil may drive his coach for meNo no  master we don't stand all wea∣thers late and early for twelve shillings a week I have known coachmen get three guineas and richly deserve it too    But not honestly    Yes honestly My coach carries four and if I now and then pick up a fifth up∣on the road how is he the worse for it  In short as it is in vain to dispute with a man against his interest I dropped the argument and contented myself with general topics till we arrived at the inn where we were to breakfast and where I first discovered the friendli∣ness of my last night's bedfellow who finding me embarrassed as he  thought with too much money was kind enough to ease me of part of it However as I knew not his name and he was a stranger to the house where we lodged I could do no otherwise than reconcile myself to the loss have recourse to my trunk and supply my pocket afresh Nothing of any consequence happen∣ed the remainder of the day I was set down at Highgate five miles short of London where the vicar's brother resided and as I tipped the coachman a shilling I had his blessing at parting so easy is it to procure the good wishes of these blades of the whip  CHAP III  DR SLASHEM the vicar's brother in law to whom I was recommended received me at his door with apparent civility but soon gave me to understand that he had reckoned without his host when he proposed taking an assistant His school was but of late establishment two scholars had lest him the day  before and he had no greater num∣ber than he could attend to himself however out of respect to his bro∣ther he would contrive to give me houseroom till I could find a situ∣ation to my liking and as he under∣stood I was not able to afford great things provided I would occasion∣ally assist him in school hours I should not pay for my lodging and board more than fifteen shillings a weekI was not so young but I could see the drift of this gentle∣man's civility instead of paying me for my assistance as I expected I was to pay for my board and lodg∣ing and give him my labour gratis however being a stranger in that  part of the world and not knowing where to go I dissembled in my turn told him how much I thought myself obliged to him and accept∣ed his  friendly  offer He introduced me to his family which consisted of a wife a daughter about seven∣teen rather pretty than otherwise and ten boys between the ages of nine and fourteen Mrs Slashem was some years younger than the Doctor and seemed to look upon her daughter with a jealous eye and as one who told her she was growing in years Miss in her turn was of a forward cast and thought she had more right to be noticed than her mother who was  a married woman and in her time had had her share of admirers in short I no sooner entered than I discovered that both had shot their arrows at me at once "Biddy" says Mrs Slashem  I wish you'd get down stairs you stare at the young man as if you never saw a young man before  Ah get down you young baggage  says the doctor  and get us some∣thing nice for supper  Miss slammed the door after her but not without giving me to understand by her looks that she was angry at being sent out of the room Mrs Slashem primming up her mouth and adjusting her features into an  affected form of reserved politeness  hoped I would excuse the awk∣wardness of her girl who had seen but little of the world and had rather outgrown her age for though in size she resembled a woman she was in fact little more than a child  Indeed my dear  replies the Doctor  you wrong the girl for you was married at her age  If I was  retorts the wife angrily and bridling up  I hope I had more discretion and more of the woman in me  "Discretion" returns the Doctor  I will say nothing about but as to the  wo∣man  I will admit that you had  always enough of that  giving me a wink with his left eye  But come the young man I dare say will be glad of a little refresh∣ment if you will be kind enough to provide it  For as we had come a long day's journey I began to wish for supper though it was but eight o'clock Mrs Slashem retired to provide for our repast and get the boys to bed and of course left me and the Doctor together He then gave me a long detail of the difficulties he had met with in establishing his school I told him  that no doubt his character had recommended him and that as he came to be better known his  number of scholars would in∣crease  Character my good friend  says he  is the least recommendation parents nowadays will put their children out where they have the most taught for the least money In order to get a good price schoolmasters are reduced to artifice  Good GodArtifice  exclaimed I  can artifice avail where children should be kept strangers to de∣ceit  You misunderstand me Sir  replies the Doctor  I mean artifice in the establish∣ment of a school I'll explain it to you it may be of use to you in life if you propose to follow  the same professionParents have an idea that the fewer scholars a man has the better he can attend to them and then of course he can demand a better price A man taking only four boys may expect fifty pounds a year for each whereas if he takes fourteen he will find it difficult to get more than twenty After a man has got one or two to be∣gin with that he may not be supposed to want scholars he gives out that he will take no greater number than fourthen he has room for two morehe procures themhe then finds he can attend to ten to which num∣ber  he will confine himself but that is only till he can get an∣other ten so that he never stops till in fact he can  get  no more  In short he gave me to understand that by such means and by a little extra attention and tenderness to those boys as were the children of wealthy parents who have it fre∣quently in their power to recom∣mend others it is that men establish a school sooner than by any other method Indeed I found it was his invariable practice to wink at the faults of the boys of opulent parents and keep up the strictest discipline with others it being ne∣cessary to punish some as an exam∣ple  to the rest when a poor man's son charged perhaps with robbing the garden has endeavoured to ex∣culpate himself by discovering the offender and laying the blame justly on his more wealthy but guilty schoolmate I have known the Doctor exclaim  It is a bare∣faced lieMaster Goldwire is the son of a  gentleman  and above a base act and I'll punish you for the false assertion  Then as to the annual price of schooling twenty pounds a year the Doctor told me which indeed was the price he had with  his  scholars was but small pay however what with the profits derived from selling the  children toys fruit pens paper and other articles at two hundred per cent gain getting from each boy half a guinea or a guinea at Christmas under the idea of presents to the servants taking their pocket money on their return from the holidays under a pretence of keeping it for them and giving them only part of it again charg∣ing in their bills occasionally a pair of shoes a copybook and the like more than they have had by such sundry emoluments he made out pretty well And on my seeming to disapprove of such conduct by my looks he told me there was no doing otherwise It was the annual  price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended To be asked thirty pounds a year would frighten them but under a notion of paying but twenty the consider∣ations he had mentioned would draw and additional twenty from them without a murmur then says he again we can get a guinea a quarter for dancing as much for drawing and fifteen shillings per∣haps for writing when in fact we pay to the different masters only half the price we charge If it was not for these arts and contrivances a school master had better be a hackney coachman and drive mules rather than boys In short I found from  the doctrine of the pedlar the stagecoachman and this  worthy  friend of mine that to live in the world a man must not be  too  honest On the same plan of reasoning the doc∣tor would have kept me for his as∣sistant for he expected as much of me as if he had paid me a salary of thirty pounds a year I was de∣termined however to get from this place as soon as I could for my re∣maining stock would not admit of my paying fifteen shillings a week for my board I had been now a fortnight in the family before I thought of removing and to do justice to Mrs Slashem and her daughter they did every thing in  their power to make my time pass agreeably The mother in order to have my company abroad would frequently desire the Doctor to spare me as it was proper where she was going to have an escort and miss would frequently steal up into my room when I was alone play about me and entertain me with the se∣cret anecdotes of the family from her I learned that her papa was no doctor but had assumed the title in order to give credit to the school that her mama had constantly a gentleman came to see her at school hours when her papa was at the top of the house with the boys in short she told me how much her  mama hated her papa and how much she detested them both and that she would give the world if any one would take her out of the house that she did not care where she went if she was but from home that her mama treated her as a girl when she knew she was as much a woman as herself and that she was going in eighteen and was deter∣mined not to be a great while long∣er in leading strings The assidu∣ous attention of the mother would perhaps have been far from disagree∣able to me if miss had been out of my reach but Mrs Slashem had insisted a day or two after my arriv∣al that I should be made free of  the village we lived in according to the ancient ceremonial of the place which was to be sworn up∣on the horns not to eat brown bread if I could get white unless I liked brown better not to put up with the maid when I could h  e the mistress unless I liked the maid better and so on and as oaths are not merely confined to the  letter  but extend to the  spirit  of them I conceived I was equally sworn not to put up with the mother if I could have the daughter unless I liked the mother better Indeed such was the favour I was in with both that I was scarcely left to my choice and a dread of the chapter  of accidents was one principal mo∣tive for my wishing myself away The censorious reader may perhaps suppose that as a young man bor∣dering upon twenty I was no an∣chorite and that I was not suffici∣ent master of philosophy to with∣stand a temptation thrown industri∣ously in my way in short he may supposewhat he willand as I profess myself a member of the reformed church and the necessity of auricular confession to be no part of my faith I shall take the liberty to leave him to his conjectures and only say that for more reasons than one I wished myself in any situa∣tion but where I was I had an  opportunity of seeing the newspa∣pers and I looked carefully to the advertisements hoping to meet with something that might suit me My circumstances would not admit of my being very nice in my choice for though I had near nineteen pounds in my pocket on my arri∣val at Highgate after I had paid the coachman and the expences of the last day's journey that nineteen from a triffling present or two to Miss a few outdoor treats to her mother in our afternoon walks and what I should have to pay for my board and washing go as soon as I would would be reduced to little more than ten pounds This and a wish for  an easy place determined me if I could not do better even to put on a livery rather than run myself in∣to difficulties and to wait for a turn of fortune to befriend me I did not communicate my design to the family as circumstances had made it necessary to conceal myself from them but told them I had a friend in London who promised to look out for a situation to place me in and under a pretence of going to this friend I had an opportunity of applying as many advertisements directed me To a  Wanted a smart young man to attend in the shop of an apothecary  I applied and found it was to open  and sweep the shop pound in the mortar carry out medicines and apply glisters this would not do it was a  laborious  employ and to labour I had not been accustomed The next advertisement that struck me was  Wanted a man of good figure in an easy genteel office with good encouragement  here I enquired and found there had been a variety of applicants most men wishing for easy places and good pay This was no other than to stand all day at the door of one of those auctioneers who are constant∣ly selling things made up purpose∣ly to take in the ignorant and incautious and with a vociferous  voice to call out to every person that passes  Walk in Sir walk in gentlemenselling by auction  The abilities for this office were lit∣tle more than a good pair of lungs and the pay was two shillings a day as the situation however was by no means a concealed one I readily de∣clined it The next was more like∣ly to answer my purpose  Want∣ed a person of good address and gentlemanlike appearance to at∣tend a few hours a day in a res∣pectable employ for which a good salary would be given  The read∣er will naturally say I had no small share of vanity to attend only to such advertisements as required  smartness  goodfigure address  and  gentleman∣like  appearance but when he is told that both Mrs Slashem and Miss had constantly given me to under∣stand that I was possessed of those qualities he will not wonder at my believing it This advertisement succeeded it was not to stand at the door of one of these auctions but to act as a decoy during the time of selling and lead persons on to bid their money I was to attend from eleven to three in the week days and my pay was to be eighteen shil∣lings a week I accepted the place and was to be initiated into my of∣fice the week following Accord∣ingly I took a lodging in the neigh∣bourhood  a two pair of stairs room in the shop of a tradesman for which I was to pay six shillings a week and I was determined to make the remaining twelve answer every other purpose Happy in this engagement I acquainted the Doc∣tor that I should now be no longer troublesome to him that I was go∣ing to America in a merchan'ts fa∣mily as tutor to his son a lad of twelve years of age for which I was to have a handsome salary Though I had not been six weeks with the Doctor I found it difficult to get away He had conceived an  affection  for me and rather than part with me would take half a  guinea a week Mrs Slashem used all her rhetoric to persuade me to continue and Miss Slashem all her charms but nothing would do I had my private reasons for leaving them and on my promise to cor∣respond with Miss as occasion should offer I was suffered to depart in peace I had been brought up with proper notions of right and wrong and could scarce reconcile this de∣ception to my way of thinking but when I considered the plea of neces∣sity and that selfpreservation was the first law of nature I was easily led to justify the proceeding I was master of my own actions and had not by a promise made to any of  the parties forfeited a right of dis∣posing of myself as I thought pro∣per  CHAP IV  MY new employer was not a little pleased with my fi∣gure he could only have wished I was a few years olderthat was easily remedied by my mode of dress and we contrived it between us that I wore the appearance of forty As the office I was to enter on required a few instructions the following  were the chief maxims he gave me  Always to watch  his  eyes and when he looked full in my face bid something more than the last bidder  Never to see a flaw or an imperfection in any thing selling  And to find out beauties if possible even where there are none  To pretend to know the value of every thing and as∣sert in a confidential manner to bidders that the article selling was worth double the money bid for it  These were the instruc∣tions I was to follow and I recon∣ciled them to myself under the fol∣lowing reasoning that bidders at an auction buy upon their own judg∣ment  and if they buy too dear it is their own faults that auctioneers are forbidden to bid themselves and that of course if they had not some friend to bid for them occasionally articles at times would not fetch half their value that deception runs through trade in general no tradesman being condemnable for not pointing out the imperfections of his goods As to any other arti∣fices made use of in the profession I was to have no concern with The auctioneer as things were not sold by a catalogue was at liberty to of∣fer any article for sale that he pleas∣ed so that if a countryman came in we were sure to have a silver  watch put up or if a lady some pieces of china or a set of silverhandled knives and forks and so on the one I would whisper was old china and the other had  townmade  blades with the handles of  so∣lid  silver and no lie neither In short I discharged my duty so well as to give my employer satisfaction and often procured him a better price for his goods than the first cost Our plan was not a lit∣tle forwarded by the  touter  Touter  is a nickname given to those who stand a shopdoors and entice in custo∣mers as butchers that cry out  What do you buy Sir  Old cloaths men in Monmouthstreet c  See what you want Sir  and men at auctions  Walk in gentlemen Selling by auc∣tion c  at the door calling out  Selling by auc∣tion  under a judgment  Must be sold Gentlemen without re∣serve to release a man from pri∣son  c It is unknown the numbers such declarations draw in to buy under an idea of getting things at half their value and if they are taken in by the law of retaliation they richly deserve it Sometimes our sale indeed has been interrupted by a person contra∣dicting the auctioneer flatly and de∣claring aloud that the article was not what he represented it in this case I was immediately directed to  bid and I became the buyer This done the company are dismissed with  Gentlemen I am much o∣bliged to you we have done sel∣ling for today  The company of course withdraw the obnoxious person gone the street door is shut for five minutes and then reopened with a  Walk in Gentlemen sel∣ling by auction  and the room is presently filled again with fresh com∣pany for these sales are always held in some very public thoroughfare  INDEED there is scarce an auc∣tion of any denomination without its impositions In sales of linen and other drapery goods they will  put seven or eight yards of silk worth about six shillings a yard into the same lot with a roll of course dowlas worth sevenpence and sell the two together at so much per yard If you ask how many yards in the roll they will tell you about thirty you make your calculation accordingly and perhaps buy the whole at one shil∣ling and sixpence a yard thinking thus to give about two pounds five shillings for the lot which at sixpence per yard for the dowlas would give you the silk for four shillings but after having paid down the earnest and the lot is to be deliver∣ed the roll of linen shall contain  sixty yards instead of thirty in which case you pay eight shillings and sixpence a yard for the silk and are encumbered with more dow∣las than you know what to do with So again in auctions of furniture the auctioneer in order to have his sales well attended finds it neces∣sary not only to treat the brokers with a dinner but to give each of them a lot at their own price so that at auctions in and near Lon∣don where there are plenty of bro∣kers if twenty are present you are sure to have twenty lots and per∣haps the best of your furniture given away The brokers on the other hand have their arts of im∣posing  if you appoint one to pur∣chase certain lots for you at certain prices under an idea that the will buy them cheaper you are sure to be charged pretty near the price you fix∣ed though perhaps they purchased them for half the money  I WAS in this employ upwards of two months when an accident hap∣pened that lost me my place Dur∣ing the selling of a plated cruetstand worth about thirty shillings who should come in but Dr Slash∣em As I was disguised he could not possibly know me except I had opened my mouth which I took care not to do He bid a guinea  and a half for it which my master did not think enough I was called upon by his looks to bid against him I did it by a nod but as the Doctor did not see it he asserted he was the last bidder the auctioneer appealed to me but I was mute as a fish and Slashem was the buyer the company were dismissed and I was immediately discharged But his anger did not cease here whilst in his service I had sold my own watch and bought rather a better and had also purchased a pair of pistols the watch which was a metal one had been brought to him requesting him to sell it which he refused I therefore pur∣chased  it for fifty shillings and sold my own for pretty nearly the same sum This watch was a stolen one and was advertised and my quondam master the auctioneer carried his re∣sentment so far as to lay an informa∣tion before a magistrate that he had seen such a watch in my possession a warrant was accordingly issued and one evening about ten o'clock as I was going to bed at my lodging I heard a great noise below and a fel∣low with a hoarse voice inquiring for one Gabriel Outcast Conscious of having done no wrong I went down stairs and was immediately taken into custody charged with a high∣way robbery All I could say had  but little effect The warrant was to be executed the watch was taken out of my pocket my room was searched and the pistols which lay upon my table seized The little money I was possessed of I put in∣to my pocket and I was thence hurried to the parish roundhouse where under lock and key I passed a very uneasy night The next morning I was taken before a trad∣ing magistrate and charged with robbing a man in the Five Fields Chelsea of his watch the Friday evening before and though I pro∣tested my innocence in the strong∣est terms and made out a very good story yet being confronted with the  prosecutor who swore to his pro∣perty and the identical watch being found upon me and the pistols in my room circumstances were too much against me to get off the only thing in my favour was that the prosecutor could not swear to my person as I appeared to be a younger man than the one who robbed him for I was not now in my auction dress but then on the other hand the master of the house where I lodged deposing that I went abroad every day in a disguise which gave me the appearance of an elderly man corroborated the sus∣picion I had sent to the auctioneer who could prove that the watch had  been offered to him for sale and whose evidence would of course have operated in my favour but he was industriously out of the way and as I could not procure bail I was committed to Bridewell till the next week when I was to be brought before the justice again  In the course of my examination his worship bawled out  hand over that there watch  which on looking at he put into his pocket with a  this must be produced up∣on the trial    Constable see what money the prisoner has a∣bout him  I had two guineas and a few shillings in my pocket  which he directed to be handed over likewise and on the prosecutor's saying he had lost some gold but could not swear to the money "I don't know how you should" replies the justice  one guinea is too like another for that it looks however like money dis∣honestly come by and so  put∣ting it into his pocket  it shall go with the watch  I  humbly conceive  said I addressing my∣self to him  that as the money is not sworn to it ought to be re∣turned me  Stop that fel∣low's mouth  roared out his worship  and give me his mitti∣mus to sign  and in an accent  lower "damn your humble con∣ceptions" I deemed it fortunate that I had secreted a ten pound note all the money I had left in my fob where these grasping fangs of the law had no idea of looking  Whilst I was in prison I met with a man who had been confined forty seven years He was shut up on execution at the suit of the crown for a heavy fine imposed on him for having in his possession some exciseable goods that had not paid the duty of course no insol∣vent act could discharge him This man bating his imprudence that brought him there was not with∣out  his virtues He was the oracle and chaplain of the jail and being a man of good sense was often a real comfort and assistance to the unhappy He had outlived all his friends and connections and had nothing to subsist on but the allowance of the prison the scanty sparings of his fellowpri∣soners almost as poor and wretched as himself and the benevolence of a few outdoor neighbours who oc∣casionally sent him a dinner or an old coat to cover him stockings he wore none and perhaps the only useless part of his dress was a wool∣len night cap that covered his bald head being grown grey within the  walls The little hair he had was wiry for affliction when it does not kill proceeds to harden Though covered with the rust of a jail and offensive through want of cleanli∣ness this old man approached me in so modest and decent a manner that I could not but be pleased with him He had acquired a degree of philosophy since his confinement for what patience will not a prison teach and seemed so reconciled to his situation as not to wish for li∣berty  To be abroad again in the world  he said  to  him  at his time of life would be irk∣some he had not a friend alive and without money could only  fly to the shelter of a workhouse  He observed  that though a pri∣son affords no comfort yet there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppres∣sor and having proportioned his appetite to the quantity of food he could get and contracted his wants within very small limits he was far from being wretched Should it please God to take him from the world he was perfectly resigned but to remove him from these walls except in his coffin and to his grave would be only to hasten his dissolution and put an abrupt period to his existence  And indeed so much did he speak  the sentiments of his soul that upon an enquiry three or four years after∣wards I was informed that the Chief Justice having from the re∣presentation of the keeper and a mistaken humanity ordered him to be released he became truly miser∣able  He was no sooner at liberty and without the prison wicket than he stopped short wild as it were and lost The broad sunshine was painful to him His eyes were fix∣ed but he could not weep Stupe∣fied at his change of situation his legs in spite of him became as im∣moveable as his tongue  CONDUCTED by a charitable hand he enquired the way to the place where once he lived His house was there no more a public build∣ing was erected on the spot He knew neither the street the town nor the objects The adjoining houses to his own had taken a new form He endeavoured to recollect them but he had lived twenty years to long  Startled he stopped and sighed and for the first time felt the comfort of a jail  where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest  Every face was new and every thing about him  strange The only person he could find of whom he had the least re∣collection was a tottering old man who formerly had been his servant he found him in a garret living on charity and from having been con∣fined to his room eighteen years had strength only to pull the cord that opened his door  THIS poor creature could not re∣collect his master whose face time and afflictions had so much fur∣rowed and the only comfort his master drew was by a participa∣tion of his grief and from a con∣viction that he was not the most miserable of beings This old do∣mestic  entertained him only with his sorrows told him that his wife was dead that he had experienced thirty years of wretchedness that his children were in some distant parts of the world unknown to him and that every friend he had was gone  At this the master sighed and sighed alone for the other was habituated to distress Broke down with grief he returns to his prison and solicits a readmission It was refused him And he experienced the force of woe now more than ever To have outlived all his re∣lations his friends nay a whole  generation To want a shelter or money to procure oneto be des∣titute of food and cloaths and every necessary articleThese were thoughts that racked him but his greatest disquiet was to be sensible that a whole generation of men was at once lost to  him  which by daily deaths the mass of mankind do not miss  Separated as it were from so∣ciety I am alive  alone  "Death" says he  may be terrible but to die the last is more so Glad shall I be when I can find the grave  As a bird that has been long con∣fined will hover round its cage un∣easy  at its liberty so was this man daily at the prison wicket impor∣tuning for admission and finding none he pined gradually away Grief wore him to the bone and he fell a martyr to a broken heart And all this perhaps for having in his house a few pounds of tea or a cannister of unroasted coffee  To this man I was not a little ob∣liged He gave me the character of Justice Fleece'em for that was the magistrate's name by whom I was committed and told me that  he had formerly been and old cloaths man and knew the value of money too well not to accept  a bribe if offered through the medium of his clerk that though he had received his education in Rag Fair he did not want for abilities and had a wonderful presence of mind on certain oc∣casions of which the following anecdote is a proof When busi∣ness at his office is slack he sends the high constable round the pur∣lieus of Drury to pick up all the straggling women he can find and bring them before him at these times they have been brought by scores Such as can make a golden interest with his clerk are generally dismissed with a repri∣mand but such as cannot com∣mand  half a guinea upon the oc∣casion are sure to be sent to Bridewell It happened that his worship had intrigued with one of these girls at a time and place when he little expected to have been known and had probably bilked her of her fee she unable for want of money to make that prevailing application which some others had done begged before she was taken away that his worship would permit her to speak to him privately as she had something of the utmost im∣portance to communicate Cu∣riosity led him to hear her and she was brought within the bar  she accordingly reminded him in his ear of a former  teteatete  that had passed between them  which as his worship was rather deaf was overheard by a person next them  and as he was in her debt she hoped it would plead as powerfully for her as any pre∣sent she could make to his clerk  And so woman  bawls out his worship  that honest man was your fatherWellYou are a graceless hussey but on  his  ac∣count I will this time forgive you and I hope it will be a warning to you to behave bet∣ter for the future  The situation of these unhappy girls is truly deplorable Betrayed perhaps by the man on whom she fondly doated and giving too much way to the propensity of nature the deluded female sacrifices her honour to her love and for this indiscretion is turned into the street moneyless and friendless here she becomes a slave to disease and infamy and a prey to those who are far more de∣praved than herself Having no∣thing to support her she has no al∣ternative but theft or prostitution and of these two evils she thinks it better to injure herself than others But this profession requires dress and there are not wanting women  to furnish it for which they make these girls pay three or four shil∣lings a day but where a girl has a good face and but little credit lest she should decamp with her hired cloaths a woman is appointed to follow her in her nightly round who never loses sight of her till she is picked up and taken to a public house there she waits her coming out and takes from her two thirds of her ill gotten pay One of these women was quarrelling with a girl of the town one evening as I pass∣ed along the Strand and would have proceeded to blows had she not been attending upon another "Blst your eyes" says she  let  me put up my whore and I'll box your for a crown  It is to be re∣gretted gretted that our police is not better regulated but whilst our magistrates are so indolent and ignorant there is little expectation of its being done  ON my expressing to this old man my astonishment at the various ways of getting money in the metropolis and how sorry I was to observe that even justice was put up to sale he gave me to understand that Jus∣tice Fleece'em had acquired a fortune by his practice that he was up al∣most to any villainy but that as from his officious industry he was a terror to felons and brought many  scoundrels to punishment who would otherwise escape the law had wink∣ed at his conduct and had even countenanced it by a pension  "THE state" continued he  having allotted a reward of forty pounds for the apprehending of housebreakers highway robbers and the like it is unknown the sums of money he picks up this way He has a gang in pay which is always upon the scout and the half of every forty pounds he this way gets he  generously  divides among them keeping the remainder to himself And what is the consequenceThat none  but such villains as the law al∣lows that sum for apprehending are apprehended An acquaint∣ance of mine  says he  told me the other day that being on business at a night cellar in Cow Lane whilst he was standing at the bar there came in a young fellow returned from transporta∣tion who addressed himself to the woman within with a 'How are you mistress' 'Aye Jack' says she 'is it you'  Yes it is  I  replies he  make me a sneaker of gin punch    Not a drop shall you have here    Why not  I expect  says she  Justice Fleece'em's men here every  instant and I would not have you taken in my house for the world  Pshaw  says Jack  they wont meddle O'  me  They'll get nothing by taking of  me  And hardly had he uttered the words but Baildock the jus∣tice's man and two of his mir∣midons entered Baildock slap∣ped him on the shoulder with  So Jack you're  soon  returned The country I suppose was too hot to hold you    Aye Mas∣ter Baildock  replies he  no∣thing like old England for me  Come will you take a sup of punch  They drank together and parted for continued my  friend as government allows but little reward for apprehending such as return from transporta∣tion this gang of Justice Fleece'em's has it in orders not to in∣terrupt such but keep them in view waiting till they resort to their old practices and then to lay hold of them by which con∣duct the apprehenders gain an ample reward  WITH these and such like anec∣dotes was this man amusing me on the first day of my arrival within the castle for so did the prisoners call their place of confinement when the keeper brought me word  that Lawyer Grind wanted to speak to me "By  no  means see him" says he  he is one of those petty∣fogging rascals that prey upon the wretched and live upon the miseries of the unfortunate  I'll tell you a story of him  con∣tinues he  that fell within my own knowledge and upon the truth of which you may rely A man of tolerable good connexions was brought in here for a high∣way robbery This fellow ap∣plied to him and amused him with hopes of escape As a drowning man will to save him∣self even catch at straws so this unhappy culprit listened to his  deceitful adviser He gave him to understand that if he could furnish him with ten guineas he would procure a copy of the in∣dictment and had no doubt of discovering some error in it that would instantly quash it The ten guineas were given but on a second visit he was told that counsel had examined the indict∣ment and not the shadow of a flaw could be found but that he was convinced from the ac∣count he had received of the pro∣secutor that he might be bought off and of the evidence that they might be softened for about twenty pound He possessed  that twenty pounds It was given and a third visit told him that the prosecutor had been ap∣plied to and was found incor∣ruptible and the evidence too respectable to be influenced that the cash had been expended in bribing those who were suppos∣ed to have some weight with the evidence but they could not suc∣ceed  However  says Grind  as I have always people ready to prove an  alibi  This is to prove that the prisoner was in some other place than the place alledged when the fact for which he is arraigned was committed  if you can raise thirty pounds more there is no doubt of success The poor  wretch applies to his friends and these thirty pounds were raised but they turned out as ineffectual as the last The trial came on the  alibi  was overthrown and the poor devil convicted Could nothing more be doneYes for ten more he would move an arrest of judgment for the pro∣ceedings had been illegal Here he was foiled again counsel had exerted themselves but the at∣tempt was overruledThere was however another step in which he flattered himself he should be more successful This was by a proper application of thirty guineas to bring over the  Recorder to make a favourable reportThis sum was also got but the means equally unsuccess∣ful In this hopeless situation the attorney addresses him again  If he could any ways contrive through his friends to raise twen∣ty pounds more a petition should be presented to the throne and care should be taken to get it well backed at the council board and he might  rely  on a pardon He usually contrived the matter to end long before it got so far but your case  says he  is an un∣common one which has hitherto baffled all my endeavours but in this final step I  never  fail  En∣couraged  by this declaration e∣very friend as for life was im∣portuned and this last twenty pounds procured but all to no purpose The death warrant was signed and an order came down for execution In a distracted state of mind the poor wretch sends for his lawyer again re∣minds him of the many promises he had made the many great sums he had received and asked him 'if there were no hopes after  all  ' 'Hopes' says he to be sure there are The peti∣tion is so strongly worded and so powerfully backed that take my word for it they  cannot  hang  youthey  dare  not hang you and there was not the least doubt but he would be left out of the death warrant  'Aye Sir' re∣turns the despairing criminal  it was on this account I sent for you The death warrant  is  sign∣ed  I  am  in  that warrant and an order is come down for exe∣cution on Wednesday morning  This the attorney  could  not stand    Execution  exclaimed he  Exe∣cutionWell  let  'em hang you  let  'em hang you and dn  me  if it shall not be the worst job they ever did in their lives    At this he turned upon his heel and left his deluded client to his fate  THIS story determined me not to see Mr Grind I sent him word my case was of a nature not to need his assistance and therefore I would not trouble him I thanked my friend for his admonition and re∣solved to trust to myself Not knowing the nature of a nightcel∣lar which had been dropped in con∣versation I wished for some account of one and requested my adviser to make me acquainted with what he knew of them He gave me the following account  A NIGHTCELLAR is an ale∣house under ground in some populous but secret part of the  town which is kept open all night for the resort of whores and rogues and all such persons whose actions will not bear the test of daylight In some of these places of rendezvous vil∣lains of note are generally to be found and through the treachery of gangs in general that of Jus∣tice Fleece'em's becomes wellacquainted with their persons There is seldom a daring robbery or burglary committed but Bail∣dock and his crew get some in∣telligence of it and though they are not able immediately to fix it on any particular man they will soon trace it out and take  the offender into custody Dar∣ing as these scoundrels are there is an unaccountable infatuation in most of them that will lead them to surrender themselves to Fleec'em's men without vio∣lence Baildock has many a time searched these nightcellars alone without fear or danger As madmen will in their raving intervals cease raving at sight of their keeper and submit quietly to him so will most of these villains yield without resistance to the mandates of Baildock Whether they are awed by his undaunted resolution or dismay∣ed by conscience or any other  motive I cannot say but Bail∣dock has been known to carry off from these places the man he looked for and without the least opposition  Master Baildock  says one of these fellows as he approached him in one of his midnight searches  I hope you are not come for I  No Tom  says he  it is not  you  I want but Dick Hounslow and I see him yonder Come Dick you must go with me    Dn me  says Dick  if I did not dream as much a day or two ago  then addressing himself to his compa∣ny  well gentlemen  says he  God bless youthis sessions will  be the end of  me  may  you  outlive many of them  and walked off with Baildock as quietly as if in irons  WAS I to relate to the reader all the information I picked up during the time I was in this prison it would fill a volume and amusing as it might have been at any other time I was too much taken up with my own affairs to attend much to it I was to prepare for a second examination A magistrate has cer∣tainly no authority to bring up pri∣soners before him to a second or a third examination if there is suf∣ficient charge against them for com∣mitment  they are to be committed for trial if not he is to discharge them but Justice Fleece'em made a trade of his profession and his house was a kind of petty court of judicature where prisoners went as it were through a formal trial It was so far of use indeed that to a villain it was a good preparatory to his arraignment at the Old Bailey and was frequently a means of his finding methods to get off  THOUGH appearances were strong against me being wrapt up in con∣scious innocence I was convinced that the arrows of malevolence could not hurt me I was not without  money and I set about collecting the evidence in my favour I re∣collected that a porter at the auc∣tioneer's was present when I bought the watch and that on the evening when the prosecutor was robbed I kept my room with a cold and had at that time a neighbouring apothe∣cary to attend me these people I was persuaded would justify my in∣nocence if the auctioneer was so relentless as not to appear in my behalf Indeed I had little favour to expect from him for such is the strange conduct of mankind that whilst a man who knows you has reason to think he is well with you he will do you no open injury but  if convenience or any circumstance has once led him to treat you ill by his sacrificing your interest to his so that he despairs of your ever for∣giving him he becomes the most inveterate enemy you have and though you have never given him the least offence it is all the fame he acts and speaks of you in future as if you had been a thorn in his side ever since he had any knowledge of you It was not so however with this man though as I since learned from his porter he was the means of my being apprehended by a false insinuation even this man thinking he had punished me suffi∣ciently thought proper on appli∣cation  to appear in my favour of course notwithstanding on my se∣cond examination the prosecutor was not present I was acquitted with the loss only of the watch I had purchased and the expence of a few pounds in messengers fees and other contingencies Before however I left the Justice I took the liberty to ask for my watch which as I had fairly purchased I thought my∣self entitled to when all the satis∣faction I could get was  The first of James the first chapter twen∣tyone says The sale of goods in London wrongfully come by shall not alter the property of course it belongs to the  prosecu∣tor  And I was afterwards told upon inquiry that on the prosecu∣tor's demanding his watch he could obtain no other answer than  The law says Goods sold in open market shall be the property of the buyer now all London is an open market and every day except Sunday marketday in London therefore it belongs to the  prisoner  I thought little how∣ever about the watch or my mo∣ney happy to owe my acquittal to my innocence indeed my watch was an expence to me which I could not well afford for as it was frequently out of order when∣ever I carried it to a watchmaker  I was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay This is one of their modes of getting money though little or nothing is the mat∣ter with a watch they will pre∣tend it requires repair which you cannot contradict and make you pay accordingly  CHAP V  BEING now out of employ I offered my service to the prin∣ter of a morning newspaper and wished to be engaged in any way he thought I might be useful to him "What is your fort" says he  can you pen a good parliamentary debate or bespatter a character  I told him  I was blessed with a  happy memory and was per∣suaded I could bring away a speech nearly as it was deliver∣ed    Delivered Phu  re∣plies he  we don't want a  verba∣tim  and  literatim  reportercan you twist an argument so as to give it a sense different from the obvious one Our paper is a party print and every line in politics must carry the sense we wish it If a speech is vehement in opposi∣tion to our principles where the sense of the speaker's arguments cannot be wrested to answer our purpose they must by pointing the passages and giving certain words in Italics be made to re∣semble  irony it is our business to write down an enemy and to do this we must impute his as∣sertions to sinister views and give a false colouring to his best ac∣tions and intentions Next  says he  as to bespattering a charac∣ter if you are clever at this I can employ you  I gave him to understand that I thought I should succeed best in this depart∣ment for that I was so determined an enemy to vice and imposition in general that I must drag it forth wherever I found it lurking  That wont do friend  says he  you mistake my meaning  Vice and imposition in general  we have no∣thing  to do with we do'nt set up as correctors of morals our plan is to write a character into disrepute that opposes our party for this purpose we must hold him forth as the worst of men and attribute to him vices that he never was possessed of  But this  replied I  is an act of cruelty and wickedness  It is neither  cruelty  nor  wickedness  says he  any means are justifiable to stop a fool's mouth or inter∣rupt an officious medler even to put him out of the world would be an act of charity to mankind and as to  wickedness  if we now and then make a virtuous man vi∣cious  we as often make a vicious man virtuous and of course he who does as much good as harm in the scale of morality cannot be a wicked man Besides  says he  we could not live without scan∣dal the more we please the peo∣ple the more papers we sell and as the virtuous of man∣kind are but  few  our business is to write for and gratify the  ma∣ny  A man in a croud will en∣deavour to lift himself above the rest though it be on the should∣ers of another so it is in society we labour to get on and become conspicuous not by any merits of our own but by depreciating  the characters of others of course most men like to see their ac∣quaintances traduced as officers in time of service who now and then suffer by a random shot are willing to run that hazard with the hopes of many of their friends dropping and making way for their promotion so in civil life men are not much hurt by an oblique stroke thrown out in a newspaper against themselves provided they are laid on pretty thick upon others  WHILST we were in this conver∣sation a poor wretch of a paragraph collector came into the office and  demanded one shilling for the fol∣lowing paragraphs  A STORY is abroad that one of the E of S's footmen was dis∣covered stealing out of Lady Betty W's bedchamber yesterday morning at four o'clock but that the news has not yet reached her father  IT is confidentially asserted that the Minister holds a secret correspondence with Monsieur de Sartine at Paris  "HERE fellow" says the print∣er  take away your dn'd inu∣endo'sdo you think we can pay  sixpence a paragraph for such uncertain intelligence as this Make them matters of fact and we shall not grudge the money  THIS business being dispatched he resumed his conversation with me "You see friend" says he  what we want you may try your hand and if you can fur∣nish us with the private intrigues of respectable families you may be constantly employed  I told him  I would take care to throw dirt enough and of course some of it  would  stick  and left him  HAVING been used to disguises I made an engagement with an old cloaths man in Monmouthstreet to equip me with such as I had oc∣casion for sometimes I was a foot∣man sometimes an officer some∣times a clergyman and sometimes a blackguard As a footman I mix∣ed with the knights of the rainbow in the lobbies of the Operahouse and houses of Parliament and by inventing a number of stories of fa∣milies where I had lived and the participation of a pint or two of por∣ter I frequently sucked their brains and got acquainted with a number of private and entertaining anecdotes As an officer I was at the Bedford  the Smyrna George's and other coffeehouses of repute and by join∣ing in conversation with industri∣ous and attentive ears I picked up a variety of intelligence respecting statesmen general officers theatres and players As a clergyman I got access at St James's gave the king when talking with certain persons a pleasant countenance or a sour one according as I wishedenter∣ed into the characters of individuals according to their looks in the draw∣ing room and when I wanted a a little better information than I could pick up at coffeehouses I ap∣peared at court in regimentals and there I could have filled a newspa∣per  at any time with the scandal I heard As a blackguard I made my way into all city and other meetings of the people and what I could not collect with my ears I made up with invention in short I became so useful to a newspaper that I was constantly employed But their pay was poor not more than sixpence for a common para∣graph a shilling for a matter of fact or scandal and half a crown for the death of a king I was at last thought worthy to be admitted into their cabinet of literary men who met on a Sunday evening the only leisure day in the week where Dreadnought our editor presided  from him we received our instruc∣tions for the six days following He was a desperate man capable of undertaking any thing and was placed in this department not for possessing any literary talents but for being adequate to fighting his way through any dirty work that was expected of him A clergy∣man was once proposed to fill this office but as clergymen cannot or must not fight and as the argu∣ment of a proprietor on this proposal had weight namely  if you em∣ploy an ecclesiasticwhat is to become of your  duels  Dread∣nought was appointed it being found necessary as the editor was  the ostensible man that he should be one that was not easily to be fright∣ened And as the occasional account of a duel between the editor and a person held forth to the public in an infamous light generally in∣creased the sale of the paper for some time afterwards great pains were taken to bring matters to such a  fortunate  issue But these men are generally well paid in the end for the party they espouse seldom fails to reward them  I CONTINUED in this employ some time but my career was interrupted through the ungener∣ousness of my employer I had in  order to obtain his favour charged a respectable person of great rank with hightreason a prosecution was commenced against the printer and nothing could atone for the offence but giving up the author and as Jonathan Wild would at any time impeach his whole gang to save himself so this multiplier of daily scandal thought proper to give in my name to the prosecutor and I was obliged to secrete myselfI lay hid some time and the matter blew over However as I observed the pay being poor the service danger∣ous and the employ such as did not agree with my feelings I look∣ed abroad for some other It gave  me indeed an insight into the arca∣na of a newspaper and if I suffer∣ed in reputation I improved in worldly knowledge I there found that like the generality of man∣kind nothing came amiss to them They would frequently abuse a cha∣racter and promise a continuance of such abuse merely to draw from that party hush money if any sum was offered for the noninsertion of a paragraph and a greater sum was tendered for its insertion it was sure to be in and  vice versa  Far be it from me to include every proprietor of a public print under this general censure there is scarce a newspaper printed but what has many pro∣prietors  who reside in different parts of the kingdom and whose opinion with respect to its conduct is too often overruled by the acting part∣ners of course they cannot be re∣sponsible for its contents but this does not alter the in case general  CHAP VI  THE next place I got and this through the means of an ac∣quaintance was that of an amanu∣ensis to a clergyman He was a man of some fortune and like most clergy∣men of fortune too indolent to write his own sermons So he was in possession of the church he cared little what became of the congre∣gation  He was the younger son of a good family had a chapel in London a fellowship at Cam∣bridge and an annuity of  l  a year sufficient together to enable him to keep a pair of horses When in town he wore a large grizzel wig a pair of squaretoed shoes in short dressed like and had all the form∣ality of a Presbyterian though a young man he screwed up his face into a primitive form and would scarce suffer a smile upon his coun∣tenance and there was such an af∣fected severity in his manner that you would have taken him for a saint but when in the country he was a buck of the first head  wore a smart bob wig leather breeches and was always in boots he had but a small stock of ser∣mons and I was engaged for a few months to provide him with a greater Having purchased a set of manuscripts which he could not well read my business was to tran∣scribe them and now and then throw in a passage or two which he occasionally penned on a slip of paper as his leisure moments from hunting drinking and the cardtable would admit Indeed I fre∣quently helped him out very often adding some passages of my own so that he would often say I should make a very good parson He was  once when at Cambridge called upon to preach in the morning at St Mary's before the university and not having a proper sermon upon the occasion nor being able to compose or to compile one was under a thousand anxieties for he studied appearances more than most young men in the church At last a circumstance happened that relieved him from his pain While in Cambridge we dwelt in college and it so happened that a fellow of the same community who lived in the ad∣joining rooms was appointed to preach at the same church in the afternoon This young gentleman  who was a very good writer and who took a great deal more pains than my master delivered his ser∣mon aloud every morning before his glass in his own room in order to acquit himself well on the day of exhibition and as the partition between the two apartments was only a wainscot I could distinctly hear every word accordingly with my master's consent I took down his sermon  verbatim  and he preach∣ed it in the morning This being unknown to the other gentleman the same discourse was delivered in the afternoon Though he who penned it laboured to have it be∣lieved that he was the author of it  it did not avail the mystery was not unravelled my master had all the credit and the afternoon preacher was considered only as a purloiner of the copy  HAVING furnished my master with about four dozen of sermons which he called a pretty good stock he proposed to discharge me and took some pains to recommend me to a friend as a very useful hand in the divinity way but his friend was of another cast he always composed his sermons himself persuaded no one could do them so well though when composed few could understand them from  the variety of new words he used and much fewer liked them He used to console himself however with observ∣ing that he really pitied his congre∣gation for the vexation they must feel at hearing so many fine things of which they were neither the writer nor the speaker It is said that those who are bit by a mad animal par∣take of its nature and insanity If this be the case I am persuaded this friend of my master's had been bit by a bookworm for he was literally literary mad See him when you would he was never without a book and when at home was almost overwhelmed with them Every new publication he purchased  it be in what language it would for though he was master of but one he fancied himself well read in all and always prided himself in having had the first copy  wet  from the press Oft have I seen him in his study almost bu∣ried in volumes They lay all round him and his table piled high upon the floor and as he would never suffer a servant to dust them for fear of derangement and was too much occupied in  little  thoughts to do it himself they were covered with dust Here he would some∣times bury himself whole days in little more than rearranging them and would be almost lost in a cloud  of dust He said that in the Eng∣lish language there was a  paucity  of expression that required to be  abun∣dified  and he laboured to repair this defect He called himself a  nealogist  or a former of new words Whenever he received a present he returned his  civilities  and thanked his friend for his  prevenient  polite∣ness and when he sent his old black waistcoat to be new dipped he requested the dyer to  renigrisy  it There was not an author abroad with whom he did not court a correspondence nor any scribbler at home whom he did not pester with his visits He would shew a card from Rousseau and a  letter from Voltaire as a medallist would exhibit a Cromwell's  silver penny  or an  Otho  As I shall have occasion to speak of this man a∣gain I shall drop the subject now with saying that as during my stay with my master I found out the art of making sermons and as no en∣quiry is ever made before a man officiates as a clergyman whether he be really in orders or not flatter∣ing myself I should make as conscientious a priest as the gene∣rality of parsons are and being so little of a Roman catholic as not to conceive that the laying on of hands by a bishop can confer grace any more than that a few words  mumbled over a piece of bread can make any alteration in its nature I determined to take no other place but to start forward in the profession myself and as this thought struck me soon after I commenced an aman∣uensis I wrote two copies of every sermon I was directed to transcribe and kept one for my own use These amounted in the end to some dozens accordingly being furnished with all the requisites of a modern parson namely a few sermons an iron grey suit and a stock of impu∣dence as soon as I quitted my mas∣ter I applied to Mr Snuffle in Pa∣ternoster Row for employ  THIS  gentleman  was formerly a parish clerk but growing tired with saying amen for twenty pounds a year he has found out a new me∣thod of being serviceable to himself under the idea of being useful to the clergy As there are register offices for a variety of respectable wants for houses servants whores c so this is a register office for par∣sons a kind of  divinityshop  in the city of London for hiring of preach∣ers readers and so on by the day or the week as occasion requires For this purpose he keeps a list of unemployed clergy of all ages and characters to suit certain congre∣gations some for example attend  much to the voice and to the action and as they never take their eyes from the preacher during the whole sermon they wish for something tolerable to look at These he would furnish with a smart prig preacher of twentyfive who would keep them awake by an exertion of the voice and a display of the arms to others who do not like to be taught by boys and had rather doze away a heavy hour or two which the law will not suffer them to employ in their respective occu∣pations and who go to church more to keep up appearances than from any spirit of devotion he would provide a monotonist of sixty For  such men like the taletellers in Scotland have a happy knack of composing a congregation into a comfortable nap  FROM this list he selects his preachers and lets them out for a stipulated sum according to the duty they are to perform taking for himself as agent ten per cent and one shilling extra for those he accommodates with a gown and cas∣sack The following is a copy of his printed list of prices     s  d  For reading and preaching on Sundays morning or even∣ing      For preaching only      For reading prayers only      For administering the sacra∣ment      For assisting at ditto      For reading prayers on a week day morning or even∣ing      For ditto on a Litany day      For ditto on a festival      For burying a corpse christ∣ening a child or praying by a sick person      For churching a woman during service       I THINK I cannot explain the nature of this undertaking better  than by giving my readers te sub∣stance of a dialogue between Mr Snuffle and a very ingenious friend of mine who once applied to him and which on his death bed he thought proper to leave to the world  "  Curate  "MR Snuffle your servant"  "  Mr Snuffle  "Doctor your's"  "Curate"  I suppose Mr Snuffle you can guess my errand I am going out of town tomorrow for a fortnight and shall want a sup∣ply and at the same time Mas∣ter  Snuffle I come to inform you I shall from this day com∣mence  agent  and  patient

business  Curate  Aye Mr SnuffleI must have a good voice for  Wednesdays  and  Fri∣days  and one of your best orators  for  Sunday next  you know my congregation is a little delicate  Mr Snuffle  Then you must have a  young  man My young gentlemen I assure you are all cushionthum∣persnone of your dreaming chapsif there's the least grain of dust in a pulpit cushion I'll be sworn they'll beat it out    looking over his list  here's Par∣son  Rawbones  one of my  athletic  ablebodied divines it is not long since he knocked down a clerk in the desk for interrupt∣ing him in the middle of a collect and it was only for telling him he was reading the wrong one  this you know shewed him to be a man of spirit and kept up the dignity of the cloth No parson let me tell you is respected now that is not a  boxing  one But I doubt whether he will do for you for he is a  north countryman  and has got a  burr  in his throat he'll never pass at your end of the town I shall sport him however at a  day lecture  or an  early sacrament  Curate  You are so facetious Mr Snuffle But pray find me some∣body for I am in haste  Mr Snuffle  If you had wanted a whiner or  bawler for a charity sermon I could help you to the best  beggar  in England an arrant pickpocket for the  middle aisle  Beats your Mr's and your Hn's our of the pit a doctor of divini∣ty too and a justice of the peace but he wont do

him more than half a guinea for the morning's dutyLet me tell you Sir I am a good friend to the inferior clergy and have done more for them and that's a bold word than the whole bench of bishops I be∣lieve I may safely say I have raised the price of  lungs  at least  cent per cent  I knew the time and so did you when a wellcas∣socked divine was glad to read prayers on a holliday for a shil∣ling old Cnever had more in his life now Sir I never let a  tit  go out  my  stable you  will pardon my jocularity upon such an occasion under half a crown  IT is to these and such like in∣dignities to which the clergy are obliged to submit that the function owes it's degradation Having re∣ceived the best of educations and flattering myself I had equal abilities in compiling and delivering a dis∣course with the best of them I per∣suaded myself that whilst I kept my own secret I could do no great harm I could pass an examination and of course could have taken orders if I pleased and as a late Bishop of Chester would never or∣dain  a man till be had officiated as a deacon for three years to see how he took to the profession I conceiv∣ed there could be no harm in my putting myself upon a similar trial  HAVING then applied to this same Mr Snuffle he soon found me employ and as I acquitted myself to his satisfaction and in a manner that did him credit I never was idle but an illjudged parsimony of mine overturned the bucket pre∣sently I was employed to read prayers on a weekday in a large parish for which I had my shilling but being called at that time on more important business to the  other end of the town I appointed a deputy and gave him half my fees but he was so out of spirits at being obliged to officiate at a price so degrading to the profession and so derogatory to the  honour  of the  cloth  that he did not exert himself sufficiently to be heard and on the clerk's hinting to him after ser∣vice that he feared the congrega∣tion did not hear him his answer was  How do you think friend I am paid  I presume  re∣plies the clerk  the usual compli∣ment  "Not so Sir" returns the parson  I am paid but  half price  and I therefore only read my  halfbest  This story was  carried to Mr Snuffle and for at∣tempting to take the bread out of his mouth I was immediately struck off his list  I AT this time got intelligence that a certain Viscount in the west having married a woman of low fa∣mily who had a maiden sister pro∣posed to give any clergyman that would take her to wife a living in his disposal then vacant of five hundred pounds a year I deter∣mined to look after this living for though I was not in orders as I have observed before being suffici∣ently qualified I could easily have been ordained the necessary testi∣monials  I made no doubt of procur∣ing This lady lived at a market town in the neighbourhood of Ox∣ford I accordingly inquired of the man who drove the stagecoach be∣tween that town and London whe∣ther there was an assembly at that place he told me there was and promised to bring me word the next time he came up on what day the next assembly was to be This information being procured I hired an elegant postchaise for the jour∣ney and took a friend with me for whom I borrowed a smart livery and who followed as my servant on horseback I let this friend into my scheme and promising him a reward  if I succeeded gave him his instruc∣tions which were to pass me for a man of good family and fortune Thus with two of my best sermons in my pocket I set off for the place I was bound to and arrived there on a Friday evening five days as the coachman told me before the assembly day Having sent for the landlord of the house where I was I inquired who served the church he told me  a young gentleman from Oxford  My reason friend  says I  for asking is that I am a clergyman and mean to pass a few days here and if I thought it would be agreeable to your minister I would ease  him of his duty on Sunday  His reply was  I have no doubt Sir but he would he very glad of the offer it is a long way to Oxford and the roads from the late rains very bad Tomorrow is market day there and as seve∣ral of our farmers will be going if you think proper to write a letter I will send it  This let∣ter was written and the answer such as I wished On Sunday I preached and from the great atten∣tion that was paid me on all sides I conceive that I acquitted myself with eclat but the object of my jour∣ney however was unfortunately for me not at church As I came  down from the pulpit an elderly lady after paying me some compli∣ments on my sermon asked me if I made nay stay in that town On my answering in the affirmative she told me her name and requested my company to dinner I waited on her and found her the gossip of the place From her I acquired e∣very information I wished and might if I pleased have learned the history of every family in the neighbourhood Among other in∣formation however I found to my mortification that the assembly was not to be so soon as I expected by a fortnight  ON my return to my quarters I begged the landlord's company and among other things asked him who was mayor of the town and what kind of a man he was he in∣formed me that he was a respecta∣ble tradesman a person of property and a goodnatured wellbred man This account so met my wishes that I called for paper and wrote the following card to be dispatched the next morning  THE gentleman who preached yesterday presents his compli∣ments to Mr Mayor and if he will give him leave will do him∣self  the honour to drink tea with him this afternoon  THE answer returned was  MR Mayor's compliments to the gentleman who preached and shall be proud of the honour of his company  WHEN evening came I ordered my carriage for this and the ton∣gue of my servant gave me no small credit waited on the Mayor and was politely received His house was full of welldressed men and women collected no doubt for the pleasure of reconnoitering me  Conceiving some apology necessary for this selfinvitation I addressed him thus before all the company  This abrupt introduction of my∣self Mr Mayor may require some apology I am here upon a little excursion and as being at an inn is irksome where I have not the happiness of being ac∣quainted I make it a rule to in∣troduce myself as I have done here to the politest families in the town where I am  The gentlemen smiled applause the la∣dies tittered behind their fans but I had the satisfaction to find myself very wellreceived Indeed I want∣ed no further introduction any where  when the company present found I came down for the assembly and had an intention of staying some little time invitations passed regu∣larly round one engaged me to din∣ner the next day another the day following and so on but in all these parties I met not with the lady I wished to see she being consider∣ed as beneath the company I was then in The Mayor I found was a pleasant man and Jack among the maids He was pleased to say that  as I had come down to honour their assembly of which he was the founder he was truly con∣cerned to think the day was so far distant as to fear the losing  me in order therefore that I might not be disappointed he would convene the ladies and have a dance at the inn where I was  He returned my visit however the next morning and with a melancholy countenance told me  the girls were of late grown so squeamish that they objected to dancing at a public house and that as their assem∣bly was in its infancy he could not permit them the use of the town hall left the neigh∣bouring gentry should on hear∣ing of this dance be displeased that they had not notice of it but that if I would do them the  honour to stay over the next Sun∣day he would advertise it in the Oxford Gazette on the ensuing Saturday and on my account would fix the assembly on the Thursday following which was a week sooner than the stated time  I of course acknowledged myself obliged and agreed to it Not having yet met nor being like∣ly to meet in the company I was with the lady I was in search of I excused myself from a party one af∣ternoon purposely to wait upon her She lived with her mother a wi∣dow determining therefore to introduce myself I wrote a card to the mother similar to the one I  sent to the Mayor and she returned he compliments saying  as she presumed I had some business with her she should be glad to see me  I went there in my carriage and saw the old lady but Miss was not with her how∣ever she made her appearance with the teatable and expressed a con∣cern that she was not at church last Sunday as she should have heard by all accounts a very excellent sermon and very gracefully deliver∣ed I entered into the chitchat of the town the proposed dance and the politeness of the Mayor told her the assembly was to be the Thursday following and hoped she  would be there her reply was  She never had been at the assem∣bly nor did she know she should be admitted for the ladies of that place did not think her good e∣nough to mix with them  At this the mother fired and said  her daughter was as good as the best and she was a fool to keep away  I favoured the idea and encouraged her to go and told her  that if she would do me the honour to dance with me I should be proud of her as a partner and would conduct her there and back Should I go  says she  I shall have no objections to dance with you but that is uncertain  So  far introduced I improved the ac∣quaintance called on her a day or two before the assembly prevailed on her to accompany me there and danced with her and we became so familiar before the close of the evening that I told her I was ena∣moured with her and solicited per∣mission to pay my addresses to her With a great deal of candour and goodnature she acknowledged her∣self obliged to me for the preference I had shewn to her before other ladies but assured me she was engaged and to a brother clergyman to whom she is since married  FINDING my plan here abortive I quitted the place and returned to London having been absent from it near three weeks and being in daily apprehension of its being found out that I was not in orders and dreading the demand of the man of whom I had the carriage and horses which amounted to near twenty pounds and which I was unable to pay I retired from my profession and concealed myself under a differ∣ent character  WHEN I reflected upon my con∣duct and the deceptions I used I held myself in detestation but I soon reconciled it to myself by the  plea of necessity and the collateral one of meaning well for had I obtained that young lady's consent and had a promise of the living as a portion I would have embraced a clerical life and I am bold to say would have acted in that life with honour and probity As it is I was reserved for a different situation There is a fatality I am convinced in the lives of all men that work∣eth wonderfully for their good and unless it be constantly counteract∣ed will gain ground gradually to its consummation  AS I set out with making useful remarks on the various passages in  my life for the improvement and entertainment of my readers I can∣not omit dwelling a little longer on the clerical profession and observing that though it's followers draw the many indignities they meet with too often upon themselves yet their po∣verty and distressed situation are fre∣quently the occasions of it The idea of bringing up a son a gentle∣man has spoiled many a good trades∣man and has thrown many upon the church whom she is unable to maintain Lectureships have been considered as a tolerable provision for those who are not provided with livings or curacies but the establish∣ment of lectureships if we believe  the same ingenious gentleman who has favoured the world with his conference with Mr Snuffle  has contributed in a great measure to bring upon the whole body of the clergy that contempt into which they are now fallen The choice of a lecturer is generally vested in the parishioners at large as they are paid by a voluntary contribution These parishioners for the most part consist of or∣dinary tradesmen sometimes ve∣ry low mechanics persons not always of the most refined man∣ners or most delicate sensations I had not been three weeks in London  says this gentleman  but strolling one Sunday after∣noon into a church in the city I heard the clerk after service by order of the vestry declare the lectureship vacant and invite the clergy however dignified or dis∣tinguished to be candidates for it and to give in their names by the ensuing Sunday Having no clerical provision I no sooner heard this  churchserjeant  beating up for recruits than I immedi∣ately resolved to  enlist  and ac∣cordingly waited on the worship∣ful  Stentor  abovementioned who took down my name and place of abode On my desiring him at the same time to acquaint me  with the best method of proceed∣ing which I was an utter stranger to he advised me as a  friend  to apply as speedily as possible to Mr  Bluemould  a cheesemonger in  Rotten Lane  who was then first churchwarden a leading man in the vestry and a person he assured me on whom the electi∣on would in a great measure de∣pend I took honest  Amen's  ad∣vice and by nine the next morn∣ing not I must own without some reluctance dressed myself as well as I could and waited on Mr Churchwarden As soon as he saw me enter the shop in my canonicals for I had hired an ex∣cellent  new gown and cassock be∣hind St Clement's on the occa∣sion he made me a low bow gave me the title of  Doctor  and imagining no doubt that I was come to bespeak cheeses for the country begged to know my  ho∣nour's  commands to which I re∣plied in an humble tone and looking extremely disconcerted that I came to wait on him on account of the lectureship of the parish and begged the favour of his vote and interest You would have smiled to have seen the sud∣den alteration of his features and behaviour he dropped all the tradesman's obsequiousness and  in a moment assumed the magis∣terial air and dignity of the churchwarden turned aside to a woman who was just then asking for a pound of Cheshire cheese and without addressing himself to me cried out 'This is the fourth parson I have had with me today upon the same errand' then staring me full in the face Well young man' says he 'you intend to be a candidate for this same lecture you are all to mount the  nostrum  I suppose and merit will carry it for my part I pro∣mise nobody but remember I tell you before hand I am for  voice  and  action  so mind your hits'  When he had said this he im∣mediately turned upon his heel and went into the countinghouse I took my leave in an awkward manner as you may suppose be∣ing not a little chagrined at his insolence and as I went out of the shop overheard his lady ob∣serving from behind the counter that I was a pretty  sprig of divini∣ty  but looked a little  sheepish  and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recom∣mended to her husband by Mr  Squintum  THESE are some of the morti∣fications lectures are subject to  and then as to their pay and the manner in which they are paid it adds still further to the contempt they lie under The churchward∣ens of a parish once waited on a quaker a tinman within their limits with the lecturer's book and solicited his contribution towards the support of the afternoon ser∣mon "Thou knowest friend" says he  that we give nothing to thy clergy  'I admit that' returns one of the churchwardens  but he is a worthy gentleman and a good preacher and you would say so if you heard him I hope therefore as our parish is small and we cannot make up  any great sum that you will add to it for the sake of your neigh∣bours  The quaker repeated his words as before and they were leaving his shop when he called them back with  Hark'ye friend though I told thee we quakers never give any thing towards the support of thy clergy yet as mayhap he may want  light  I'll gee'un a  lantern  "The lecturer's box" continues my friend  generally goes about with the rest of the parish beggars a little before Christmas and every body throws in their charity for it is always considered in that light  as they think proper Were I to mention how many paltry excuses are made to evade this little annu∣al tribute by the mean and sor∣did how very little is given even by the most generous and what an inconsiderable sum the whole generally amounts to the recital would not afford my readers much entertainment and for aught I know might give them some real concern  A lecturer 'tis true is licensed by the bishop and of course cannot be removed but notwithstanding this he is far from independent if he shews any marks of displeasure or does not please his congregation he feels  it at the next collection and when they are tired of him they with∣hold their subscriptions and as they call it starve him out  "You cannot imagine" proceeds my friend  with what an envious eye we poor lecturers have often looked over a waiter's book at a coffeehouse where I have seen such a collection of  guineas  and  halfguineas  as made my mouth water To give less than a crown would be to the last degree un∣genteel for the immense trouble of handing a dish of coffee or a newspaper whilst the poor di∣vine who has toiled in the mi∣nistry  for a twelvemonth and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable service shall think himself well rewarded with the noble donation of  half a crown  I know a little too much of the world to expect that a par∣son should be paid like a firstrate player a pimp or a lord of the treasury whose incomes I believe are nearly equal but I cannot help thinking that a  labourer in the vineyard  is as well worthy his hire as a journeyman carpenter or mason and has as good a right to two pound two on a  Sunday  as they have on a Saturday night and yet not one in an hundred is paid in that proportion  To illustrate my subject I will give my readers another story there is nothing like a little painting from the life on these occasions Suppose yourself then an eyewitness of the following scene which passed not long since in the neighbourhood of CoventGarden  Enter  Twist  the churchwarden accompanied by the overseer into the shop of Mr  Prim  the mercer  Prim  Well Mr  Twist  what are your commands with me  Twist  We are come to wait on your honor with the lecturer's book Sir  reads  a voluntary contribu∣tion of the inhabitants of the pa∣rish of St Paul CoventGarden for the support of  Prim  Well well you need not read any farther what is it  Twist  "Whatever you please Sir  Prim  Aye here's another load a∣nother burden dy'e think I am made of gold There's the poor's rate the doctor's rate the win∣dow rates the devil's in the rates  I thinkHowever I can't re∣fuse  you  but I'll not give ano∣ther yearHere  Buckram  reach me half a crown out of the till Your servant Madam  a lady comes out of the back parlour walks through the shop and gets into a chair  Aye there's another tax a guinea for two box tickets as sure as the benefit comes round for my wife and daughter be∣sides chair hire  Twist  shaking his head  O Master Prim Master Prim Had not you better now have gi∣ven us a guinea for the Doctor and his four children and re∣served your halfcrown for the  lady who if I may judge from her garb does not want it half so much as the poor parson But you will be in the fashion so give us your mite Set down Mr Prim two shillings and sixpence  SUCH is the force of example the influence of fashion that a constant churchgoer and one perhaps who fancies himself a ve∣ry good christian shall throw a∣way  one pound one  with all the pleasure imaginable for an even∣ing's entertainment at the theatre and at the same time grudge  half a crown  for two and fifty dis∣courses from the  pulpit  which  if he turns to his arithmetic book he will see amounts to about three farthings a sermonand a  sober  citizen tooas Lady Town∣ly saysFye Fye  IN short such are the mortifica∣tions to which the inferior clergy are exposed that if I had a son to bring up and could not give him either a fortune or a good living I would sooner make a  coalheaver  of him than a  parson  CHAP VII  I WAS now once more master of myself and had an employment to seek but was very low in cash so low that I could not remain long out of place I had recourse again to the newspapers and applied as the fol∣lowing advertisement directed me  Wanted a smart young man as footman to a lady  She lived  in a wellfurnished house in a gen∣teel street at the west end of the town I went in the morning and was introduced to her whilst at her breakfast A  I was pretty well dressed and came into the room perhaps in a manner different from what footmen in general do she rose from her seat and when I told her I waited on her in consequence of her advertisement she seemed ra∣ther confused and said  She pre∣sumed that either I did not ap∣ply for myself or that her place would be below my acceptance for that  her  servant must wear a livery  I told her  an overthrow in life had humbled  my mind and reconciled it to any situation that was not disho∣nest or laborious and that as to wearing the livery of a lady it was what my superiors would be proud of  She seemed to smile at my answer and doubt my sin∣cerity and  freely acknowledged that my manner and language would do credit to a gentleman  She asked me if I had ever lived in the capacity of a servant I told her  I had and should be happy to be her's  A very few words further passed between us she con∣descended to say  She was so pleased with my appearance that she should inquire no further a∣bout  me I carried too much ho∣nesty in my face to need any other recommendation  She said  she had engaged a servant but that she would put him off and take me in his stead that her place was not a fatiguing one it was little more than to wait upon herself and that if I would accept of it with eighteen guineas a year and a live∣ry I might come as soon as I pleas∣ed  I bowed an assent and told her  I would attend her the Monday following  She gave me a di∣rection to her taylor in order to get a new livery and desired I would make my first appearance in it The livery was white faced and lin∣ed  with pale blue silver buttons and epaulet with a waistcoat of the co∣lour of the facings laced with sil∣ver blue plush breeches and silver laced hat and the taylor having made it smart and to fit me exact∣ly paid me the compliment to say that  I  rather graced the livery than the livery  me  and among all the servants he had dressed he had never seen one that became his cloaths so well  It is rather an awkward task to be under the necessity of sounding one's own praise but as the reader can hear nothing of one who writes his own life but from the mouth of him who guides the pen and as he may  wish to have some little description of my person the following is the simplest account I can give I was at the time I am now speaking of a strait wellmade man five feet nine inches high of a middling size neither too corpulent nor too thin just turned of twenty dark hair and a great deal of it had a good set of teeth and if glasses told truth a speaking countenance and a penetrating eye I was given to understand that I had a graceful fi∣gure an insinuating address and the manner of a gentleman with these perfections and accomplish∣ments and the education I had re∣ceived with a good flow of spirits  and sanguine health it must have been wonderful had I not pushed on through life as well as I have done I must own that whenever I fell it was through the impetuosity of pas∣sions the heedlessness of youth or want of worldly knowledge I set out with very few expectations and fewer friends but I had philosophy enough to acquire a certain degree of fortitude and was determined to be a cosmopolite and take the world as it goes  HAVING arranged my little mat∣ters at the house where I lodged I dressed my hair in the most fashion∣able manner which from custom I was expert at put on a ruffled shirt  silk stockings and a pair of Artois buckles and when I surveyed myself in the glass dressed as I was in my new cloaths I thought myself a complete coxcomb however as I flattered myself from the livery my mistress gave and her being pleased with my appearance she would not like me the worse for that I sent my trunk to her house by a porter on the Monday I had promised to go and followed it soon after myself  MY lady was a woman about forty years of age that seemed to have been handsome in her youth her figure was rather  em bon point  and she passed for a widow under the name of Duplex On my coming to her house she sent for me up stairs and I could perceive was not a little pleased with the fi∣gure I made She told me that I became my livery exceedingly well that she kept a boy to clean shoes and knives and that all she expect∣ed of me was to wait at table and attend upon  her  Having in∣quired my name "Gabriel" says she  you seem to be a young man of uncommon good sense I presume I need not tell you that servants should carry nothing out of the families they live with nor see any thing they ought  not to see If you attend to this and are industrious and civil you will find me exceedingly good to you  I HAD not been a fortnight in this house before I discovered that my mistress was one of those conve∣nient  obliging  women who admi∣nistered to the pleasures of others She was not is the true sense of the word a procuress nor did she keep ladies of easy virtue under the roof with her but her house was rather in the stile of a private bag∣nio where men of fortune might find an asylum with their ladies for an hour a night or a week as it  suited them She had not the least conception of my finding this out the parties that came having always passed for her friends and my fel∣lowservants who had not  my  pe∣netration were kept in the dark I might if I pleased have conti∣nued long in the service of this wo∣man had not an event taken place which gave birth to a variety of fu∣ture embarrassments in the course of my life My mistress was particular∣ly kind to me and would familiarly converse with me all the time I was waiting on her She took some pains to draw me aside from the narrow path of rectitude and gave me many broad hints of the favours  she had in store for me She would frequently ring the bell and call me to her toilet even before she had well adjusted her dress ask my opinion of female beauty and often desire me to tell her whether her hand∣kerchief was put on to advantage "Gabriel" says she one day to me leering under her hat  You can∣not have been in many places pretty young fellows like you are soon taken out of servitude You shan't wear a livery long but shall be groom of my bed∣chamber    What say you Ga∣briel Should you like such an office  I plainly saw at what she directed her artillery but she  was a woman that did not please me and I will be honest enough to own that aversion had more weight with me than principle She was at all times very inquisitive about my family and connexions and was very importunate to know where I acquired those accomplishments she was pleased to say I possessed but as I did not mean to continue lon∣ger with her than I could help I was reserved in my answers and respectful though very distant in my replies  She told me she ex∣pected a young lady from the country in a day or two to be with her some time that a fami∣ly difference would oblige her to  leave home and that her being with her was to be a secret of course if I could keep a close mouth I should be amply re∣warded and that I was by no means to communicate to my fel∣lowservants any thing I might hear or see above stairs  I re∣plied  that she might rely on my fidelity  with which she seemed satisfied I was the more displeased with my mistress as I conceived her to be of a profession the most de∣structive to female virtue and the greatest bane to domestic happiness of any existing The pride of many an honest family had been over∣thrown I understood by her and  many a virtuous girl had owed her ruin to her officiousness That there are many of her stamp in the great metropolis is too evident to be doubted and that they are not made public examples of is very much to be lamented The young lady my mistress mentioned was brought to our house one morning by a gentleman in a hackney coach She appeared to be about seventeen and was one of the prettiest young women I think I ever beheld with such a sweetness of expression and such a virgin modesty about her as attracted all my attention and made me instantly conceive something treacherous in her story The gen∣tleman  that accompanied her seem∣ed to be a man of fashion about thirty years of age and I could see that on his introducing her to my mistress she had never seen her be∣fore The affair appeared to me mysterious I felt myself some how or other interested in her cause and was determined if she was incauti∣ously seduced into this house to watch her virtue with as much care and assiduity as if she had been my sister The gentleman dined with her staid the greatest part of the day but left her in the evening He continued his visits in like man∣ner the next day and the day after and during the times I was waiting  on them I could discover nothing more than that industrious atten∣tion which polite men generally pay to the object of their affections She seemed to take a more than common notice of me and observed to my mistress which I overheard when in the next room that she was persuaded from my manner that I must have been brought up a gentleman Things went on pret∣ty smooth for two or three days when my mistress took an oppor∣tunity to go out and left them to themselves They drank tea alone and I waited at tea and nothing happened to increase my suspicions till about nine in the evening when  I heard a clattering of the chairs and their voices rather louder than ordinary This put me upon the watch and presently I heard her scream with all her powers I in∣stantly flew up stairs darted into the room and found her fainting on the sopha and he in a situation better conceived than described but very declaratory of his wicked in∣tentions On seeing me enter the room he seized me by the collar with  Rascal who sent for  you  Get out of the room this instant or I'll be the death of you  catching hold of his sword which he drew  I told him the lady seemed to need protection and I  would defend her with my life  The poor young creature that mo∣ment recovering her senses begged of me  for God's sake to continue with her and save her from ruin  The gentleman on the other hand in the utmost rage and pushing me from him insisted on my leaving the room or he'd run me through the body and finding me determin∣ed not to obey his injunctions un∣armed as I was he made a lunge at me which having parried with my hand I closed in upon him and disarmed him The young lady screamed and fainted again and her ravisher took up his hat hurried down stairs and made the best of  his way out of the house He was no sooner gone than I assisted her with some hartshorn which I found on the mantlepiece and brought her to her speech Seeing herself free from her violator she called me her deliverer thanked me in the warmest terms for standing forth in her defence and hoped I was not hurt for when she saw him draw his sword she expected no∣thing less than my murder I told her I was no way hurt but to see her so illtreated that he had en∣deavoured to run his sword through me but that from some know∣ledge I had of the use of that weapon I had escaped the threat∣ened  mischief and had disarmed him that he had left me in posses∣sion of his sword and was gone and that I esteemed myself singularly happy in having been her protector She rose from the sopha walked across the room to a chair and beg∣ged me by no means to leave her but to sit down and concert some means with her of getting her out of that house which from many circumstances she suspected to be of no reputation  She told me that she was the daughter of a private gentleman of good family and for∣tune that her name was Wildman that the person who had so treated her was a man of rank who had so∣licited  her hand in marriage but his father being alive and he not being able to make a sufficient set∣tlement on her her father had op∣posed the match that this gentle∣man however having gained her affections she had been so impru∣dent as to leave her home and come here with him as into the house of a friend where they were privately to be married and wait the reconciliation of her father that under a variety of frivolous pretences he had delayed the cere∣mony and she now saw the drift of his base intentions that his conduct had at once obliterated every spark of her attachment and that if  possible she now hated him more than ever she loved him  This be∣ing her story  she asked me what I thought she had best do  I told her frankly that I thought the sooner she was out of this house the better for reasons if she pleased I would hereafter give her that as she seemed deter∣mined not to pursue the motives that led her to leave her father's house namely that of giving her hand to a man who had such designing views upon her honour I would by all means advise her to return acknowledge her in∣discretion to her father and as he would now from what had  passed have no reason to dread her elopement with the same person in future I flattered myself he would readily forgive her  This ad∣vice she immediately closed with and was anxious to leave the house before my mistress return∣ed I encouraged the step told her  if she thought proper I would fetch a coach from the stand at the end of the street and attend her home  She a∣greed to this I called a coach handed her into it in the presence of two of the maidservants who were standing in the passage and hav∣ing privately told the coachman to drive to Berkleysquare where her  father lived I got up behind and the coach drove from the door  WHEN we were got two or three streets length from the house she stopped the coach and begged to speak to me It was to direct me to knock but a single rap at the door and to tell the servant that opened it that she wished her fa∣ther not to know of her return till she had seen her mother When we reached the house I obeyed her directions she parted with me at the door but desired me not to say who she was nor where I had left her and if I could get out in the morning that I would be with her  between eleven and twelve On my return home I found my mis∣tress was above and that she was extremely angry with the steps I had taken As soon as she heard I was in the house the bell was rung and I appeared before her "Gabriel" says she with warmth  what is this you have done Where have you left Miss  I gave her a particular account of every thing that I knew had happened in her absence and as I had determined to quit her service I gave her to understand that she had a great deal to an∣swer for that from the story she had told me prior to the young  lady's coming to her house I was convinced that she was privy to the scheme laid for her destruction and that I esteemed myself particularly fortunate in being the cause of its prevention  Where have you carried her to  says she  That Ma'am  replied I  I am not at liberty to divulge she is I trust in safe hands and out of the way of any similar danger  Harkye Gabriel  says she  you may possibly think yourself ex∣ceedingly clever but I must tell you that you are a very impudent fellow to take any such liberties in a house where you are only a servant But I deserve it in tak∣ing  you without a character the only thing that vexes me is that I should have been at any ex∣pence for so worthless a scoun∣drel However strip and turn out you shall not lay another night under my roof  Ma∣dam  replied I  was you to reflect a moment you would be careful not to irritate one that has you so much in his power if it was not for the means it has afforded me of rescuing a deluded young lady from the violence of a ravisher I should regret the hour of coming with∣in your doors as it is Madam I esteem myself happy in hav∣ing  entered your service and shall think myself equally so in quitting it I am directed to ask you for the small trunk be∣longing to the lady which if you think proper to deliver it may save a further enquiry into your conduct and I shall then leave  your  cloaths and take my own  Oh I might have it  she said  She wanted nothing belonging to the minx nor ever desired to hear of either of us again  Accordingly having got her trunk I called a coach put off her finery dressed myself in my own cloaths took leave of my fellowservants and made the best of my way to my  former lodging where though late at night I found an admission  THE next morning I waited on Miss Wildman at the appointed time who appearing in a morning dress seemed lovely in the extreme and I had the pleasure to receive from her angelic tongue her grateful thanks for her miraculous preserva∣tion She told me she was  still more obliged to me for the advice I had given her which had re∣conciled her to the best of pa∣rents and without which she should have forfeited that love she never was so sensible of till now She asked me "what re∣ception  I had met with from my mistress on my return"  I re∣lated every particular and told her  I had brought away her trunk and though I had lost my place I did not fear getting another having done no otherwise than as justice and duty had compelled me  She gave me to understand that  her father wished to see me and begged I would stay in the ser∣vants hall till he had an opportu∣ity of speaking with me  I was no sooner at liberty but the ser∣vants flocked about me and thanked me by their looks as well as words for restoring to them their lost young lady they told me how much she  was beloved by the whole family and how much they feared their master would never more have received her but they were joyfully disap∣pointed that her contrition for her conduct had wrought her recon∣ciliation so effectually that they believed her father and mother loved her now more affectionately than ever  Mr Wildman soon sent for me up and with tears in his eyes thanked me for having been the deliverer of his child he said  she had seen he believed her indis∣cretion had repented of her con∣duct and of course was more  endeared to him than ever  he told me  she had acquainted him with so much of the story as her senses permitted her to be witness of and he would be glad to hear the remainder from  me  I relat∣ed it to him in the manner it hap∣pened and when I had finished the tale he with a degree of enraptur∣ed enthusiasm flew to me and em∣braced me blubbered out the sen∣timents of a grateful heart for the kindness I had done both him and her and assured me he would be a friend to me for ever  There was a gallantry  he said  and greatness in my conduct that would do honour to the first of  characters and as he heard I had lost my place in the cause he would take me into his service and I should be immediately about his person  He put into my hand a fifty pound banknote and told me he would give me one every year whilst I thought proper to continue with him Poor as I was I modestly refused the note saying  I was amply gratified in having merited his good wishes and his daughter's  but he replied  fifty pounds he hoped would not hurt me  and insisted on my taking it He then told me he could employ his present va∣let at an estate he had in the  country and I might come to him when I thought proper I accepted his proposal and repli∣ed that  if agreeable to him I would attend him the next day  Matters being thus adjusted I re∣turned to my lodging and prepared to removemy little baggage the next morning but curiosity leading me to enquire at Mrs Duplex's whether the gentleman had called or sent for his sword or whether my fel∣lowservants had heard their mis∣tress say any thing concerning me I called there in the evening under a pretence of returning a corkscrew I had inadvertently taken away in my pocket and was admitted privately into the kitchen where I was soon  told that the gentleman had been there for his sword and that both he and my mistress had vowed ven∣geance against me whenever they could find me I smiled at their me∣naces and left the house as secretly as I entered it  CHAP VIII  THE next day put me in posses∣sion of my new place to which I was the more eager to go as it would give me an opportunity of occasionally seeing Miss Wildman an attachment to whom I found  maugre  the great distance between us grew insensibly upon me and dangerous and fruitless as the thought might be I could not but  indulge it I called to my remem∣brance that in the course of my reading far more unlikely things had come to pass than what I coveted She had now no  penchant  for any man the late object of her affecti∣ons from his villainous conduct was become odious to her she had no∣ticed me even before the late ac∣cident happened in a very favour∣able lightshe seemed endowed with an uncommon share of sensibi∣lityshe owed me attentionshe owed me  gratitude  and she called me her pròtector and deliverer On the other handI was consci∣ous in having been bred up a gen∣tlemanof having had a liberal edu∣cation  of having good connexions and being allied to a good family and fortune for my father's uncle though he would do nothing for me was possessed of an estate of four thousand pounds a year and there were only two persons the children of my father's elder brother between me and that estate and these per∣sons unmarriedWith such chi∣merical such fugitive notions did I now and then amuse myself I was determined however not to offend the family I was in but to watch and wait patiently for that critical moment if ever it should arrive that might give a more favourable turn to my pretensions Our family  consisted of my master my mistress and their daughter who were Ro∣man Catholics and of a great numof servants and it seemed a very happy one when I first became a part of it but as I was a favour∣ite up stairs I soon became obnoxi∣ous below I studied all I could to conciliate the affections of my fellowservants but that demon Jea∣lousy which seldom takes possession of the human mind but it makes it see things through a false medi∣um and gives a different colour to transactions than what they natur∣ally bear this jealousy poisoned all their tempers and every thing they did for me was more than I deserv∣ed  my shoes and buckles were not half cleaned the knife I was to eat with did not cut the bread I was helped to was dry the bear flat and as I was generally attending upon my master at the usual time of breakfast in the housekeeper's room when I came down to eat mine the muffins were gone the water was cold and the cream was slopped In short there seemed to be a conspir∣acy against me and for no fault of mine that I was conscious of I was too much of a gentleman for a ser∣vant I wanted two or three to wait upon me and I studied nothing but dress affected airs and fine language I bore all this very patiently for  what will not a person bear with a favourite object in view I imput∣ed their conduct to ignorance and lowbreeding and prided myself in returning good for evil My master who ufed always to converse with me when I was dressing would treat me more as a friend than as a ser∣vant and with a degree of concern would often complain to me of the conduct of his people below at which times I always took pains to excuse their faults and explain away their errors but this availed me but little they were not sensible of my good wishes towards them and hated me merely because I was beloved by their master and mistress  All I could do in the present situ∣ation of things was to make a friend of Miss Wildman's maid and which I aimed at for more reasons than one as it would facilitate my intercourse with her mistress and she was disposed to get me my break∣fast which was my best meal in her own room She was a goodna∣tured woman about thirty years of age and greatly in her young lady's favour Through her I learned that Miss Wildman had expressed the highest regard for me and wished for an opportunity of being of use to me she had frequently observed to her maid as she had done to Mrs Duplex that I had the manner of a  gentleman and was sure though in the situation of a servant I had received a gentleman's educati∣on and that her father and mother were of the same opinion for that they had never remarked in any ser∣vant they had men with that good sense that gallantry that respect∣ful attention and that insinuating address that marked my character and that she was anxious to know my history Through this same channel I made her acquainted with every thing concerning me of which the reader is too well inform∣ed to need a repetition here and as far as I dared to do I made Char∣lotte understand which was the  name of Miss Wildman's maid that though I ventured my life in the de∣fence of her mistress and was too much her friend to wish her in any perilous situation again yet I should rejoice in a second opportunity of convincing her how much I had her safety at heart This I foresaw would be carried to Miss Wildman for Charlotte had too much of the waitingmaid about her not to take pleasure in carrying tales backwards and forwards Had I been butler in the family I should have had frequent opportunities of being in her presence but in the capacity of her father's valet I seldom could see her Now and then she would  come into her maid's room whilst we were at breakfast and sit and chat with us The first time I saw her upon this occasion I rose re∣spectfully from my seat at which she seemed hurt "Gabriel" says she  I am much obliged to Char∣lotte for her Attention to  you  any respect she shews you will be gratefully acknowledged by  me  for to you I am indebted for every thing  I humbly told her  she rated my services too high for independent of any protection due to suffering innocence such me∣rits as Miss Wildman could boast of laid the strongest claim to every necessary interference  She  told me  that she frequently came into her maid's room to speak with her but if it disturbed me or put me the least out of my way she would never enter it again and it was her request in future that I should not notice her coming in  I replied that  as a command of her's I should obey it  At these occasional in∣terviews she would be affable and familiar and once she condescended to tell me  that Lord B who was the son of the Earl of A and who had treated her so ill had made several applications for leave to renew his addresses to her but she was determined never to  listen to him more Her heart  she said  was her own again and she hoped she should have suffi∣cient discernment and resolution never to bestow it more upon a worthless objects  Charlotte  says she  one day to her maid  for Charlotte told it me again  was I mistress of my own fortune I don't know but I would bestow it upon Gabriel he appears to be a young man of such nice ho∣nour and such virtuous sentiments as would be an ornament to any line of life he may be thrown into  I assure you Miss says Charlotte it would not be ill be∣stowed for Gabriel is the son of  a gentleman has had the best of educations and though now in the capacity of a servant has an estate of four thousand pounds a year in expectation  In short she made her mistress acquainted with many parts of my history such as I had let her into  IT was a practice with me in every scene of life into which I was thrown to acquire all the information I could respecting that scene here then I learned the fatigue and absurdity of a fashionable life and the tiresome round of dissipation attending it My master in one of his conversable mo∣ments told me there was no satis∣faction  in the visits men of fashi∣on paid to each other and that he had  cut  Cut  is a fashionable term for given it up  it long since  Visits among the great  he said  were merely ceremonial and rather troublesome than otherwise he had visited a man for seven years together and never once had seen him  Indeed I heard myself a gentleman once say to a lady who rated him for not calling oftener to see her  It is your ladyship's fault entirelyI would come oftener if you would not let me in  Nay vi∣siting is allowed to be so much a cere∣mony that I have been told of a lady who having omitted to tell her por∣ter that she did not chuse to be seen  put her head out of window and call∣ed out to her visitant on knocking at the door "I am not at home" Frequently has my master told me that in the younger part of his life he and his lady received so many in∣vitations on the same day that they have been obliged to divide them∣selves and go from one house to an∣other shewing themselves each at two or three places on the same even∣ing and on my asking whether it would not have been better to have omitted going to more places than one He replied  No nothing but illness if in town is an excuse for nonattendance if an invit∣ation is once or twice unaccepted  party will be asked no more  John our porter has entertained me frequently for a long time together with visiting relations He told me when ladies have so many visits to return that they cannot personally pay them it is not an unusual thing to send the empty chair which stop∣ping at the end of the street the footman steps forward to the house knocks gently at the door and asks the porter confidentially if his lady sees company if answered in the negative he knocks hard beckons to the chairmen to come up and leaves a card if answered in the affirmative no notice is taken but they proceed to another house To  avoid however this troublesome piece of business gentlemen will now leave their names at the door with∣out enquiring for the master or attempting to go in and ladies will send their servants to do the same and the delivery of such card shall be construed as a visit made and re∣turned And what is all this but farce and tiresome ceremony the end of visiting is social intercourse and friendly converse but this mode of visiting destroys that end A mo∣dern visitant seems to dread the meeting of a private friend as if he was fearful his conduct should be en∣quired into and censured and as if he abhorred the necessity of saying a  civil thing to his acquaintance Whatever these people may think such conduct is disgraceful and must arise from want of abilities to join in general topics or from fearing re∣flection as owls fear the daylight  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
