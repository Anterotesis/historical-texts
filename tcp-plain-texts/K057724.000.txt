 THE APOTHEOSIS OF PUNCH A SATIRICAL MASQUE WITH A MONODY On the DEATH of the late MASTER PUNCH  AS NOW PERFORMING AT THE PATAGONIAN THEATRE Exeter'Change With Universal Applause  I've heard that Things inanimate have mov'd  And as with living souls have been inform'd  By magic Numbers and persuasive Sounds  CONGREVE  LONDON Printed for J WENMAN Fleetstreet F NEWBERY Corner of St Paul's Churchyard and W THOMPSON Exeter'Change in the Strand  M DCC LXX IX  TO RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN  Esq  ONE OF THE JOINT MANAGERS OF THE THEATRES ROYAL and OPERAHOUSE THIS  JEUd'ESPRIT  IS HUMBLY DEDICATED BY HIS MOST OBEDIENT AND DEVOTED SERVANT  PLUNDER  Dramatis  Doctor Plunder  Roscius  secundus  PUNCH  Apollo  Bacchus  Pan  Death  Undertaker  Mutes c  MELPOMENE  THALIA  APOTHEOSIS OF PUNCH  PRELUDE  SCENE I  A DressingRoom in the Theatre  Doctor Plunder  and  Roscius secundus  discovered  Doctor Plunder  I HAVE founded my piece upon two ideasthe first a custom among the Egyptians who publicly tried the conduct of their great men after death and then gave judgment on their merit Secondly a custom of the Greeks and Romans who pronounced orations over the bodies of their deceased heroes or over their ashes when inurned  Roscius secundus  I fear few in these days would pass the Egyptian ordeal immaculate or merit the Greek or Roman oration But I am surprized Doctor Plunder that you who have suffered so severely for traducing Master Punch while living should now become his Panegyrist particularly as his  executors  have no  pecuniary  demands upon you But having shifted off this mortal coil and become defunct like Zanga's revenge I suppose your enmity expired with your foe You war not with the dusta lion preys not upon carcases  Doctor Plunder  Master Roscius secundus you have hit the right nail on the head I hated Punch while living but now he is dead I am determined to be one of his most zealous eulogists Our dislike arose from that mutual antipathy which naturally exists not only between dramatic authors but every class of writers whether coiners cutters clippers or counterfeiters of literature  Roscius secundus  Your sentiments Doctor exactly coincide with mine His failings all lie buried in the grave and all his good comes rushing on my soul Never will I again mimic his peculiarities with buffoon drollery But do you not think the plagiarism of our piece will meet the disapprobation of the audience  Doctor Plunder  By no means I have only stolen from Shakespeare and Poets set up a prescriptive right to purloin from him I am convinced from experience that Plagiarism meets as much success as Originality The addition of a few  songs  to a Tragedy makes an excellent  Masque  and airs judiciously introduced into a  Cut Comedy  answers all the intents and every end of an  Original Opera  I know how to secure the approbation of the public by crook or by  Hooke  Roscius secundus  I will say that for you Doctor you do not descend to  petty larceny  your robberies are open and bold  Doctor Plunder  I plead guilty to your arraignment and the Prologue which you speak to this night's entertainment I have taken partly from old Jack Dryden and partly from Alic Pope I am like Sir Roger de Coverley's chaplain who always preached from printed sermons when unable to compose himself In dull moods I make bold with the works of others  Roscius secundus  But do you not think Doctor that the  Monody  is rather too highly elevated in the  hyperbole  In praising your hero you have made mere cyphers of every other puppet Like a poet laureat you  have centered every virtue merit and qualification in an individual which is outheroding Herod and an insult upon commonsense and modesty  Bell rings  But hark the prompter's bell rings  Doctor Plunder  Adieu I will retire and write a few puffs for the newspapers I have precedent for puffing my Monody in the public prints  Roscius secundus  And in your puffs be sure to remember me as I have not leisure to puff myself I assure you Doctor puffing is often a means of procuring a good engagement and if you give a critique upon this piece before it is printed I expect to shine forth in the Critical Review or if it be published to have my person delineated by Roberts and stuck in the window of Bell's Circulating Library  Exeunt  SCENE II  Before the Curtain  Enter  Roscius Secundus  as Prologue  The lab'ring bee when his sharp sting is gone  Forgets his golden work and turns a drone  Such is a  Satire  when you take away  That rage in which his noble vigour lay  The honeybag and venom lay so near  That both together you resolved to tear  And lost your pleasure to secure your fear  This is plain levelling of wit in which  The poor has all th' advantage not the rich  The blockhead stands excus'd for want of sense  And wits turn blockheads in their own defence  Yet tho' the Stage's traffic is undone  Still  Scandal  with her smuggling trade goes on  Tho' Satire on the Theatre you smother  In  paragraphs  you libel one another  Each flaming patriot who would rule the roast  We find  dissected  in the  Morning Post  While those who get in place and think they're wiser  Are  butcher'd  in the  General Advertiser  Your  Magazines  with Scandal are replete  And monthly damn a brace in  têteàtête  Like desp'rate pirates they refuse all quarter  Wives widows virgins suffer in the slaughter  Yet women sure are privileg'd from war  'Tis not like knights to draw upon the fair  Tho' true of late they act  en militaire  On this our poor epitome of stage  Against the vicious mortal war we wage  Eye Nature's walks shoot folly as it flies  And catch the manners living as they rise  We've tragic heroes here of  mandrake root    Comedians cut from leg of poor  Sam Foote  Our poet too as you this night will see  Is mostly made of  Shakespeare's mulb'rytree  All that is  not  his own you'll find is good  He steals like other modern bards of  wood  Who  cook  up broken viands in a dish  Like Spanish  olio  mixed with flesh and fish  Nay ladies do not laugh tho' small I'm mighty  My heart is  English oak  my head is  lignum vitae  Exit  SCENE III  The great bell tolls and the curtain rising slowly to solemn music discovers a long Gothic aisle six wings on each side hung with black and black curtains falling in drapery from the roof ornamented with escutcheons banners ensigns armorial helmet crests pendants  c  In the center stands a coffin covered with crimson a black pall flowing over it a canopy plumes  c  At each wing stands a mourner and at the head of the coffin choristers  FUNERAL DIRGE BY THE CHORISTERS  A cold and breathless corse behold he lies  His spirit fled far far beyond the skies  See where the plumed sable hearse doth stand  Behold the mutes a pensive weeping band  Virtue on earth adorn'd his manly breast  Of fair and manly grace he was possest  He knew nor harm nor guile nor us'd deceit  He liv'd belov'd and all his death regret  The grieving crouds lift up their mournful voice  None but the Undertaker fell rejoice  Undertaker  RECITATIVE  Fall back make room there stand aloof  A light is breaking through the roof  Was ever seen so great a wonder  Look at the joists they fly asunder  What can it be descends in thunder  Thunder  MELPOMENE  the  TRAGIC MUSE  cloathed in Royal Mourning descends in a Chariot a dead March playing  Melpomene  Fate spoke the word the cruel arrow flew  And jocund PUNCH lies with the mighty dead  Oh what a Phoenix lieth here o'erthrown  Th' observ'd of all observers quite quite down  But all must die  The world's a stage  And all the men and women merely players  They have their exits and their entrances  And one man in his time plays many parts  And what is life  Life's but a walking shadow a poor player  Who vainly struts his time upon the stage  And then is heard no more  Each gay scene that rises on the bosom of the earth  Must vanish The cloudcapt towers  And gorgeous palaces the solemn temples  The great globe itself yea all which it inherit  Must dissolve and like the baseless  Fabric of a vision leave not  A wreck behind  Soft music  But lo the Comic Muse descends  Tearfalling pity starting from her eye  Pining in thought she comes  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She looks like patience on a monument  Smiling at grief  THALIA  the Comic Muse descends in a Chariot  Thalia  What is she whose woe  Bears such an emphasis Whose phrase of sorrow  Conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand  Like wonderwounded hearers  Melpomene  'Tis I Melpomene your sister muse  Thaliathis is a sorry sight  Thalia  Alas poor PUNCH I knew him well Melpomene A fellow of infinite jests of most excellent fancy who held as 'twere the mirror up to nature to shew virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure He was not one of those robustuous perriwigpated fellows who tear  a passion to very rags and who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shew and noiseHe ever suited the action to the word the word to the actionHe was a man of wax and all he has left behind are  dishclouts  to him No more like  him  than I to  Hercules  Melpomene  He was a man take him for all in all  We shall not look upon his like again  O what a grace was seated on his brow  Hyperion's curls the front of Jove himself  O 'twas a brow where honor might be crown'd  Sole monarch of the universal earth  An eye  ike Mars to threaten and command  A station  ike the heraldMercury  New lighted on a heavenkissing hill  A combination and a form indeed  Where every God did seem to set his seal  To give the world assurance of a Man  Com'st thou Thalia on purpose  To attend these obsequies  Thalia  No other cause on earth could bring me down  From mount Parnassus or move me  Laughterloving goddess thus to tremble  Sob or shed a tear nor shake my solid virtue  From her point but PUNCH's death  O let us cut him out in little stars  And he will make the face of heaven so fine  That all the world shall be in love with night  And pay no worship to the garish sun  Melpomene  Oh it is dark with him  Here he doth lie upon the wings of night  Whiter than snow upon the raven's back  Come Death come grimlook'd Death  Give me my favorite hero  DEATH  rises cloath'd in royal robes a diadem on his head  Angels and ministers of grace defend us  Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd  Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell  Be thy intent wicked or charitable  Altho' thou com'st in such a horrid shape  I'll speak to theeSay who art thou  That thus revisitest the glimpses of the moon  Making night hideous Say why is this  Wherefore What should we do  Death  Being immortal thou hast never seen me  But sure this dart and mark of royal sovereignty  Upon my brow should tell you I am  Th'unerring executioner of FateFirst born of  Sin  Begot by  Satan  Melpomene  Alasalas  Death  Your sorrow's vain  You cannot free PUNCH from my chains with tears  And too much grief still shews a lack of wit  I am not to be mov'd  You may as well go stand upon the beach  And bid the main flood bate its usual height  You may as well use question with the wolf  Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb  You may as well forbid the mountain pines  To wag their high tops and to make no noise  When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven  As bid me quit my prey From ev'ry living creature  Life's my due The flesh of PUNCH is mine  And I stand here upon the forfeit  And penalty of my bond  Thalia  What base insatiate monster can he be  AIR  You vilelooking rascal how dare you presume  Your phiz to intrude and I in the room  Quick this instantout of my sight  You illfavour'd dog must I speak in vain  Sirrah how dare you here longer remain  So horrid a figure I never did see  Melpomene tell me who can he be  With bleach'd bones that look so white  Death  Ladies'tis my opinion you but sham  You cannot sure be ign'rant who I am  Tipstaff in chief I stand at old Time's  forum  Where I 'tend  secula seculorum  Regular as justice of the  quorum  As for you  to Thalia  impudent Miss Virago  Know I'm the true  mortis imago  Thalia  Nay sir in English we request you'll speak  Modern muses know not  Latin  no nor  Greek  Melpomene  What is't you want grim sir pray let me know  From this you shall not force poor PUNCH to go  Shall he of late so gay and sprightly bow  To such a barebon'd visage Who art thou  Death  O don't you ken me I will tell you then  'Tis I who conquer all the sons of men  No pitch of honor from my dart is free  My name is  Death  have you not heard of me  Melpomene  It is in vain his obdurate heart  Cannot be mov'd 'Tis more inexorable far  Than roaring lions or the raging sea  But  Time  will one day trample on your power  To Death  And even  Death  shall die  Jovial music  Enter  Pan  Pan  By the lawharry this is right good fun  And here comes jolly Bacchus on his tun  Melpomene is't you Thalia sure  Ladies I'm yours  votre' serviteur  AIR  Here Bacchus comes  Here Bacchus

descends in a Chariot drawn by Pegasus  Apollo  O stop your hand you rash you foolish ass  I am come down from mount Parnass'  The sister muses of the azure sky  Sent me as Plenipo in their  Dilly  Drawn by Pegasus their fav'rite steed  Because their orders needed special speed  At first a seat I did intend to try  In the new setup  Literary Fly  But there I found so many fools had places  Their weight I fear'd would quickly crack the traces  O heavens in what wretched plight I see  Divine Thalia and Melpomene  Sure they're not sunk into ebriety  Bacchus  The nymphs did take a gulp too much or so  Which seiz'd upon their craniums  mal àpropos  But friend Apollo do not fume nor fret  Tipling's a common breach of  etiquette  AIR  I my art have here been trying  As I found them weeping crying  Moralizing sobbing sighing  Wailing with sad sound Sir  At their lips I plied my bowl  To exhilarate the soul  But the damsels drank so foul  They fell upon the ground Sir  Apollo  Now indeed may Genius mourn and weep  Since  Tragedy  and  Comedy  both sleep  Since dulness has besotted the two wenches  No wonder actors play to empty benches  Art thou here Master Death  Bon jour bon jour    I am sent down from Heav'n PUNCH to cure  Death  Thou know'st Apollo all that live must die  Passing thro' Nature to Eternity  Are you to make this man a deity  Well I won't budge till you your power try  Apollo  Are you ignorant good man Death that I am the god of medicine and keeper of the Promethean fire that  Esculapius  was my pupil and that the College of Physicians are my disciples  Death  Since that is the case friend  Apollo  I shall wave my claim to Master PUNCH and will not quarrel for a single life or so I am under very particular obligations to the College of Physicians Neither the Penal laws of England the Inquisition of Spain or Religious Persecution send so many subjects to my realm as the Gentlemen of the Faculty  Apollo  You do not mean regular bred Doctors I hope You must be speaking of Quacks and Mountebanks  Death  Pardonnez moi  I am speaking of your followers of  Galen Hippocrates Albumazar  and  Paracelsus  who kill by regimen and the  golden rule  of of physic Readers of Greek and Latin who come commissioned with  diplomas  from the Universities Doctors are my Recruiting Serjeants  Apothecaries my Corporals and Chymists my Mustermasters As to Quacks they are my Swiss auxiliaries every pill they administer has the effect of a bullet and they do me as much service as storms and earthquakes  Apollo  RECITATIVE  What ho what ho thou mighty genius ho

set your patient's lungs in motion  Apollo  You tipstaff Death about your bus'ness hie  I bring from Jove a  noli prosequi  For PUNCH's body Jupiter thought fit  To send by me his  habeas corpus writ  Answer meDo you  traverse  or  submit  Shake not your headavaunt and quit my sight  For Jove decrees that PUNCH shall come to light  Death  Sir  Pol  you need so severely snub  Or for a trifle kick up a  hubbub  Pray don't insist upon it I should go  But let me stay and see the  Rareeshew  The coffin falls asunder and discovers  Punch  Punch  RECITATIVE  What pow'r art thou who from Death's bed  Doth make me rise right willingly my head  Odzounds I find myself as cold as lead  Punch  rises  AIR  Come leave off your stroaking me  And don't be joaking me  If't please your worship Apollo Apollo  You see by my hunch Sir  I'm plain Mr PUNCH Sir  Then what has produc'd all this hallo this hallo  Say say what's the matter  D' ye mean it for Satire  O you're worse than the public papers the papers  You'll the Nobles provoke  If you keep up the joke  For me but a cutter of capers of capers  Apollo  Ladies arise get up for shame awake  And  Somnus  from your drowsy senses shake  RECITATIVE  Down

hang the ass  Who's thinking for tomorrow  Melpomene  What says grim  Death  Will you with us be merry  Death  No thank you I'm engag'd at  Pondicherry  There I have Frenchmen lying dead in gross  The Englishmen have giv'n them  coupdegrace  AdieuI must fly off to 'tend the war  The East wind blowsI snuff the carrion from afar  Death  flies off  Martial music clouds descend with a figure of the late  Samuel Foote  of satirical memory surrounded by emblems of Satire enclosed in a wreath ef thistles and nettles dressed in the character ef  Asmodeus  in the  Devil upon Two Sticks  Melpomene  PUNCH let me lead you to your chair  Of Parnassus you're dubb'd SubMay'r  With my right hand I take you as my own  To place you on your glorious wellearn'd throne  Under the man who often with shrewd tricks  Was us'd to play the  Devil on Two Sticks  Thalia  And to me give your other hand  Here mighty PUNCH you're to command  As  Locum Tenens  to Apollo  Huzza huzza let us all hallo  All huzza  Punch  Such politeness I never saw  Ladies you're true  Jenescaiquoi  Alamode FrancoisDébonnaire  And fit my humour to a hair  Hail ye Goddesses divine  Take these simple thanks of mine  Oft before my life was ended  'Twixt you I have stood suspended  Like a Peer's arms with beast supporters  Or drunken man held up by porters  Melpomene if't please you I would fain  Take just one peep at poor old  DruryLane  Apollo  No PUNCH at  Parnassus  you're wanted  That is a favour cannot be granted  But nothing in the power of the Muse  That PUNCH can wish to ask will she refuse  Punch  Then tell me Muses what is the reason  That you have both in the playing season  Left the Theatres without protection  Is it the effect of new direction  I never did approve the  Partnership    And fear the Stage and Managers  will trip  Melpomene  My good friend PUNCH you must not be surpriz'd  For know the Drama is  monopoliz'd  Poets of merit now are all adrift  My fav'rite sons are put to their last shift  No piece permitted on the stage t'appear  But what's receiv'd through  interest  or  fear  From  CoventGarden  Theatre I fled  Sca  'd by the bombast sustian of  Buthred  And from  Old Drury  I was forc'd to fly  By an inhuman  Law of Lombardy  Nor had poor  Comedy  a better fate  She too was forc'd to quit her ancient seat  Her works cut up to answer singsong rhymes  For  Preludes  and for  Speaking Pantomimes  Congreve  and  Farquhar  now in vain we seek  Instead of them we see the  Devil's Peak  But come good PUNCH you now with us must rise  A Power immortal to the highest skies  Apollo  AIR  All shall yield to this great prodigy  All shall yield to this great prodigy  None like thee O PUNCH can be  None like thee O PUNCH can be  Matchless was he we ne'er shall see  The like again of immortal he  The like again of immortal he  The clouds ascend The mourners enter and sing the words of the above Air in chorus  Exeunt  FINIS
